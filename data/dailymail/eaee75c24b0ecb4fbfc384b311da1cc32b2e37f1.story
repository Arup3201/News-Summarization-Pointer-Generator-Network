The married couple found dead at their Massachusetts home along with their twin boys have been named as Scott Jones and Mei Kum Jones, both 43, and relatives have said that they were in the middle of a 'nasty divorce'.

The couple, who lived on a quiet street in Arlington with their sons, Colt and Cameron- who would have celebrated their first birthday on November 26th- were discovered on Monday afternoon and police sources said they appear to have been killed with 'some kind of cutting tool.'

The Arlington Chief of Police added that there is no risk to the public safety and that police aren't looking for a suspect. They were called to the scene by another tenant in the building who requested a well-being check.

It has now been revealed that police had previously been called to the home on two different occasions before the twins were born last year.

Mei Kum Jones and her twin sons Colt and Cameron (pictured) were found dead at home along with her husband and the boys father Scott Jones today in Arlington, Massachusetts

In the summer of 2010, they were called to the Arlington home after Scott Jones threatened to kill himself.

The Boston Herald reports that the reason for the second call has not been revealed.

The Middlesex District Attorney told The Boston Globe that the deaths were 'very troubling, very tragic situation,' but they would not reveal any further details about the crime scene except to say that the family died violently. 

Neighbors described Mrs Jones as attentive to her children while Mr Jones has been portrayed as obsessed with home improvement projects, as some people saw him pull up flowers that he had just planted before replacing them all over again.

'There were signs of trouble,' said Clare MacFarlane, whose mother is the Jones' next door neighbor.

'He’s just busy — busy, busy, busy, busy. Always fixing something, doing something, digging. He was always working on the house.

'I’m horrified. I’m horrified. Those poor babies.'

Investigation: Police dress in booties to enter the crime scene where the bodies of two adults and two young children were found this afternoon in Arlington, Massachusetts

Unidentified: The district attorney still hasn't identified the bodies, as they wait to contact the deceased's next of kin

No suspect: In a press conference this afternoon, the chief of police said that they are currently not looking for a suspect in the case and that neighbors need not worry about public safety

She also told The Herald that Mr Jones had a son and daughter, ages 10 and 12 respectively, from an earlier marriage.

Mrs Jones' own brother old local station WBZ-TV that the couple was in the process of splitting up.

'I think he just moved out a couple of days ago, and I think she's going through the motion of the divorce,' Ben Li said.

'Arlington victim's brother tells me his sister was great person, loving mom. He is horrified at what's happened,' Kate Merrill tweeted.

She had been previously married for four years from 2000 to 2004 and her ex husband, who has not been named, spoke to The Globe about how he was shocked at the news.

'She was a very sweet, wonderful person. I can't imagine anyone wanting to do her any harm,' the man told the paper.

Mrs Jones worked at a travel and education not-for-profit organization called Road Scholar and graduated from Bentley University which is near Arlington.

Tragedy in the suburbs: The bodies were found in Arlington, Massachusetts, a suburb about twenty minutes northwest of Boston

'Mei was a valued member of our team, and her loss is deeply felt by all of us,' Road Scholar said in a statement.

'As we grieve together, we can only imagine the impossible loss Mei’s family must bear, and our deepest sympathies are with them.'

The bodies were found at 45 Newland Road in Arlington, off Summer Street near Peirce Elementary School. Neighbors said that they didn't hear any gunshots last night.

A neighbor told WHDH that a couple lived in the bottom apartment where the bodies were found, and that they had twin boys under a year old. The neighbor said that the woman had purchased the condo about five years ago before getting married to her husband three years ago.

The tenants of the upper apartments were seen speaking with police outside the house before putting their own small child in their Subaru and driving off. The woman was clearly upset and being consoled by her husband.

So close: According to other neighbors on the street, the couple pictured lived on the upper floor of the building while another couple lived on the bottom floor where the four bodies were found

Out of there: The couple were seen packing up their belongings and speaking with police before leaving the crime scene

Neighbor John Belli was out raking leaves when his daughter came running home, afraid something had happened to him.

The police had blocked off traffic on the street four or five houses up from his.

He told Boston.com that there was a marked car at the end of one street and an unmarked car at the other and that helicopters were flying above.

Mr Belli has lived on the street for 47 years and describes the neighborhood as nice, quiet and kid-friendly. 

'I used to leave the doors open, but not anymore,' Mr Belli said.

Amy
Iannelli, a 74-year-old retired cleaning lady lives just a few houses 
away from the crime scene and doesn't remember police being called to 
the house before.

'I am heartsick to think that kids...' she started. 'It's heartbreaking.'

'It's a great neighborhood,' she added.
