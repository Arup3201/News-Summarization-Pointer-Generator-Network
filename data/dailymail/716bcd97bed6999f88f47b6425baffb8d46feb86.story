Some people just have to go one step further when it comes to Christmas lights, but you'd be hard-pressed to top this electrifying display using an incredible 500,000 volts.

Eccentric amateur scientist and dad-of-three Peter Terren, 53, has come up with a unique way to add a special spark to the festivities a mesmerising electric light.

Mr Terren has been playing around with lethal doses of electricity for over a decade, but likes to make a special effort for Christmas, when he also dresses up as Santa.

Electric Christmas: Madcap scientist Peter Terren poses in his Santa suit next to one of his incredible Christmas light shows that use a staggering 500,00 volts

He produces his display by sending the massive voltage through a Tesla coil a transformer that turns electricity into ribbons of light that fire directly through the air or strike nearby objects like lightning.

Peter, a medical consultant, from Bunbury, Western Australia, said: 'I do it all in my own backyard with stuff bought from hardware shops.

'My kids are grown up now but I still like to make a big explosion of some sort for them every Christmas.'

According to Peter his dangerous 
experiments are 'absolutely useless and with no practical purpose', but 
his website has a huge cult following and his family love his crazy 
hobby.

He added: 'My wife pretends not to be interested but she loves it really.'

When asked what attracted the Physics drop-out to his dangerous electrical hobby, he said: 'It's great - try it. Stand next to a small Tesla coil and try not to be impressed.

'Stand next to a large one and try not to be incontinent.'

Needless to say these tricks should not be tried at home.

Peter warns: 'My high voltage stuff is dangerous and easily fatal. I have safety procedures and safeguards so I don't get fried alive.'
