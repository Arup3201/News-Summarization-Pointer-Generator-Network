A stirring social campaign to highlight the issue of homelessness at Christmas has launched by making those who so often go unnoticed impossible to miss.

A video circulated by Adot.com begins with homeless people rummaging in bins only to find what appears to be pieces of wire, which they then wrap around the arms, faces and bodies.

But to the strains of a choir version of Radiohead's Creep the wires turn out to be bright Christmas lights and transform the images of desperation into something disturbingly beautiful.

The figures are then shown illuminated between dumpsters, walking over a London bridge with a shopping trolley, in an underground walkway and with a dog (which is also wrapped in lights).

'This Christmas there will be over 93,000 homeless people,' it tells. 

'What will it take for you to see them?'

The key phrase in the Radiohead hit appears to be 'I want you to notice' with Adot.com's predominant message being to highlight 'the fact that homelessness is all around us but that no one seems to see it'.

The campaign aims to raise money for the Amy Winehouse Foundation and New Horizon Youth Centre
