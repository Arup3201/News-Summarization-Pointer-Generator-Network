Zlatan Ibrahimovic will be offered the opportunity to become Paris Saint-Germain's sporting director when he decides to retire.

The striker, who has endeared himself to supporters since a move from AC Milan two years ago, said earlier this month that he intends to stay in the French capital for the remainder of his career.

And club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has jumped on those words, admitting that he hopes Ibrahimovic sticks around in some capacity.

Not ready just yet though! The striker has been Laurent Blanc's talisman this season in a triumphant campaign

'I spoke to Zlatan so that he’ll stay with us when he finishes his playing career and becomes sporting director,' he told RTL radio.

'If he does that he’ll become the best sporting director in the world. He’s got a big personality and everybody respects him.

'I appreciate the professional that is Zlatan, the man that is Zlatan. He’s very, very funny. I want to keep some former players when they stop, for example Zoumana Camara is somebody I would like to keep with us.'

Ibrahimovic remaining at the Parc des Princes would represent a major coup for Laurent Blanc's side, who have favoured former players taking up senior roles.

Only this week Blanc himself has been talking about the potential return of Leonardo - who left the club in August.
