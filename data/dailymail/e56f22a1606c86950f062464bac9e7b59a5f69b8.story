There are times in life when the mirror is seriously not your friend, and the moment I catch sight of my reflection as my eyebrows are being dyed is certainly one of them.

Clouds of black foam are clumping in gigantic globs, Norman Lamont-style, where I used to have normal arcs of facial hair. Fortunately, there is no cause for alarm. This is merely the first step in the uber-fashionable HD Brows treatment I am receiving, in a quest for striking, Cara Delevingne-inspired arches.

My own brows have always been a somewhat shapeless and nondescript shade of mouse, barely tweaked by tweezer and never touched by make-up, despite the amount of slap I habitually trowel on everywhere else. I just didn’t think it would make any difference.

Now, however, my humble follicles are being tended by go-to eyebrow stylist Nilam Patel, who founded the HD Brows brand in 2008, and whose bespoke technique has seen celebrities trampling over one another for an appointment. Nicole Scherzinger, Mel B and girl band The Saturdays are all on her books.

Amanda Holden is the latest of her clients to grab headlines with her dramatically resculpted brows. Two weeks ago she was spotted on the red carpet without the barely-there blonde arches which usually curved above her eyes. In their place she flaunted thick, straight and strikingly darker brows — the result of 18 months of HD Brow appointments, every four to six weeks.

‘She began with really slim brows,’ says 43-year-old Nilam. ‘I convinced her a fuller brow would suit her deep-set eyes and frame her face.

‘So I put her on a regrowth serum and wouldn’t let her tweeze anything herself between appointments. She loves the power brow she has now, though it doesn’t suit everyone — it usually complements a fuller, wider or long face, and also girls who wear minimal make-up, for example Emma Watson and Keira Knightley.’

Actually, I’m not the biggest fan of Holden’s new look — it’s a tad over-stated for my taste. However, I am intrigued to see what Nilam will make of my weedy brows.

‘I notice everyone’s brows,’ Nilam admits. ‘I talk to their brows. Jennifer Lopez is top of my customer wish-list. Kate Middleton too — I love her, but her brows look too strong for her face, too done. She could do with them lighter and softer.’

I have to apply a patch test at home 48 hours before my appointment to ensure there’s no reaction to the dye, then we begin the first step in the HD process — consultation. Nilam asks if I know what colour and style I’m looking for (my answer: nothing too terrifying) and what my usual maintenance regime is (barely any).

‘Of course there is only so much we can do with just this one appointment,’ she says.

‘I can get you on track but 80 per cent of clients have to follow a regrowth plan lasting for up to 18 months.

‘When I dye your brows I will include some of the downy, fluffy hair you have around the edge of your brow, then cheat by using some of it to make the brow look thicker.

‘I’ll show you how to achieve the shape with a bit of make-up. We fake it until we make it.’

I am told I should not tweeze anywhere at all after the first session, and that in 12 to 18 months the brows will be much thicker.

However, she adds that about 20 per cent of clients never achieve full regrowth and always have to enhance their brows with make-up. I point out what Nilam has, of course, already noted — that my left brow is far more arched than my right. ‘No one’s brows are naturally symmetrical and if they were it would look strange,’ smiles Nilam. ‘That said, I always prefer the shape of one brow, and on you it’s your right.

‘Think of your brow in two parts, the body and the tail. The body — the wider part — should form two thirds of the length, with the tail — the thinner part — as the last third. At the moment the body of your left brow reaches under halfway.

‘Also, the bulb of your right brow begins nearer the bridge of your nose, which I like. So I’ll fill that in on the left to match, and also widen the thin arched part.’

Nilam then starts step two, the custom-blended colouring, by cleansing my eyebrow area and decides on a medium ash brown, from around 100 available shades. For the four minutes or so while the dye is on, I look like the lovechild of Groucho Marx and longtime Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev — and when Nilam wipes off the dye, the resulting brows are startlingly dark.

Step three is browmapping, where Nilam judges how much of the tinted fluff can be incorporated into the new brow shape.

Step four sees the application of eyebrow wax to the surplus dyed fluff, then step five is the slightly painful threading, which removes the waxed hairs to create a natural look.

Her final step is to add pencil and powder to make the brows bolder and fill in any gaps. And after 45 minutes of her hallowed ministrations, I have to admit: I’m a total convert to the church of the HD Brow, singing non-stop happy-clappy hymns to the utterly transformative effect of her method.

The mirror is my friend again, after all: my unbecomingly small eyes are somehow enlarged by the darker, thicker brows that Nilam has created.

Suddenly I understand why I have always looked vaguely peculiar without my habitual heavy fringe — because my eyebrows were so unformed that it almost appeared I didn’t have any.

Not any more. Even without make-up, surely the ultimate test of hideousness, I no longer resemble a boiled egg.

My previously blancmange-like features have been reframed by new, defining contours.

I am an instant junkie. I know I don’t want to give this up.

Fortunately, there are now around 4,000 accredited HD Brows stylists nationwide, all of whom have paid £1,200 to attend Nilam’s three-day course and receive instruction in the technique.

Many HD stylists charge £40 per appointment, so maintenance visits every four to six weeks, as recommended, may require the thick end of £500 a year.

Before seeing Nilam, I would have thought that sum an absurd expenditure on eyebrows. But now I completely get it.

More to the point, so does my new best friend, the mirror.
