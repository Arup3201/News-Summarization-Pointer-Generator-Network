Arthur Scargill celebrated that he had outlived his old foe Lady Thatcher when he heard of her death, it was revealed last night.

The militant former leader of the National Union of Mineworkers was the Tory prime minister’s most bitter enemy during the miners' strike of 1984 but has not commented publicly on her demise.

But it emerged last night that Ken Capstick, treasurer of the Socialist Labour Party which Arthur Scargill leads, sent the former union boss a text message on Monday reading: ‘Thatcher Dead’.

SMS: Ken Capstick, treasurer of the Socialist Labour Party which Arthur Scargill leads, sent the former union boss a text message reading: 'Thatcher Dead'. Mr Scargill replied simply: 'Scargill Alive!'

Mr Scargill replied simply: ‘Scargill Alive!’

Mr Capstick told ITV News: ‘I’d been talking to Arthur some ten minutes earlier so I sent him a text message, a very short one, just said “Thatcher dead”. I received one almost instantly saying “Scargill alive!” and he’s very much alive.

‘We now have a situation where the government and the establishment have a funeral on their hands which they wish they didn’t have. They need this like a hole in the head.’

Lady Thatcher’s victories over Mr Scargill in the miner’s strike and Argentine dictator General Galtieri in the Falklands war were hailed by her supporters as the two key moments of her premiership when they paid tribute in Parliament on Wednesday.

Mr Scargill staged the nationwide walkout without holding a strike ballot, an omission which fatally undermined public support for the NUM.

Lord Tebbit, one of Lady Thatcher’s closest allies, said: ‘The trades union generals had brought down Ted Heath’s Government. They brought down Jim Callaghan’s Government. They brought into office the Government of Lady Thatcher.

‘They expected, particularly Master Scargill, to bring down her Government, too. What would have become of our democracy had they succeeded?’

Labour’s Lord Gilbert hailed Lady Thatcher’s good fortune in facing Mr Scargill. ‘Baroness Thatcher was very lucky,' he said. 'To say that is in no way to diminish her achievements and accomplishments.

‘Arthur Scargill, I ask you. Would you not love to have Arthur Scargill as your opponent in any debate, a man who is frightened to go to his own members to get them to vote for a strike that he called? I cannot find parliamentary language to use to describe Arthur Scargill.’
