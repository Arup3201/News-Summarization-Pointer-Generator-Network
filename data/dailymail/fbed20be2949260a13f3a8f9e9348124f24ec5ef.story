A British soldier fighting in Afghanistan has been accused of cutting off the fingers of dead Taliban fighters - which he then kept as 'macabre' souvenirs.

The squaddie, from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, is said to have carried out the horrific ritual during the battalion's last tour which ended in April.

It will provoke anger amongst Muslims who are traditionally buried with all their body parts.

The Ministry of Defence has launched a probe into the 'very serious allegation' - and has tasked the army's elite Special Investigation Branch to look into the shocking accusation.

A source told the Sun: 'These allegations have rocked the battalion. That said, they are being kept very hush hush for obvious reasons. Only one soldier is said to have been involved.

'The Afghanistan tour was his first one and it's possible that the stresses of that made him do these horrific things.'

The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland, is known as 5 Scots and is based in Canterbury, Kent.

It became Britain's lead presence in Helmand, where it traveled with The Royal Highland Fusiliers as part of 16 Air Assault Brigade, last September.

As part of its second tour to the country it took control of the Helmand Police Training Centre.

Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie has now called for urgent action over the allegations and said the Army must act quickly, if the 'sickening acts' were the result of severe military trauma, to make sure others were not suffering in the same way.

Claims: A British soldier is alleged to have cut the fingers off dead Taliban fighters

Honorary colonel of the Argyll's Cadet Force Clive Fairweather added that he was 'baffled' by the allegation.

He said that during training soldiers were told they must treat the enemy dead with respect.

And he also revealed that taking trophies from the dead was a 'sure fire way' to provoke anger from locals.

The MoD would not reveal the total number of allegations, regarding soldiers stationed in Afghanistan, currently being investigated.

But a spokesman did tell MailOnline that the overall figure was very low.

He said: 'This is not endemic.'

He also confirmed the Special Investigation Branch, which specialises in cases considered too serious to be dealt with by the standard Royal Military Police, was involved in the case.

And he added: 'This is a very serious allegation and it would be wrong for us to comment. An investigation is ongoing.'

Douglas Young, executive chairman of 
the British Armed Forces Federation, said: 'We don't know if there is 
anything in these unproven claims, but the MoD is right to investigate 
rigorously.

'British soldiers don't want anyone 
serving alongside them who has been involved in such irrational, 
unprofessional behaviour as is alleged.'

The allegation comes a month after relatives of Iraqi civilians who were ill-treated and unlawfully killed by British troops during the Second Gulf War were told they would receive thousands of pounds compensation from the UK Government.

The European Court of Human Rights ruled in July that the accused soldiers were, while at war in Iraq, governed by Europe's human rights convention.

Judges overturned a 2007 House of Lords ruling that there was no UK responsibility regarding the deaths.

In doing so they backed victims' relatives who insisted they should be treated in line with the safeguards of the human rights code.

The cases before the human rights judges involved incidents between May 2003 and late June 2004, during the UK's time as an occupying power in Iraq.

Three victims were shot dead or shot and fatally wounded by British soldiers, either on patrol or carrying out raids.

Another died in an exchange of fire between a British patrol and some unidentified gunmen.

A fifth victim was allegedly beaten and forced into a river where, as a non-swimmer, he drowned.

The sixth death was Baha Mousa, seized by British troops from the hotel along with nine other Iraqis by members of the 1st Battalion The Queen's Lancashire Regiment (QLR).

He was taken to a British military base where he was beaten and died of asphyxiation two days later with 93 injuries identified on his body.

A seventh victim, Hilal Abdul-Razzaq Ali Al-Jedda, 54, is a British and Iraqi national now living in Istanbul.

He was arrested in Iraq in October 2004 by American soldiers accompanied by Iraqi national guards and British soldiers, on suspicion of terrorist involvement in Iraq.

He was taken to a detention centre in Basra run by British forces. Periodic reviews concluded he was a threat, but he was released - more than three years later - without charge.

Relatives of all victims insisted they were within UK jurisdiction when they were killed or detained, and therefore could expect treatment in line with the safeguards of the human rights code.

The human rights judges ordered the Ministry of Defence to pay Mr Al-Jedda damages of 25,000 euro (£22,400) and 40,000 euro (£35,700) in costs and expenses.

The relatives of those who died - apart from Baha Mousa for whom the UK authorities accepted human rights responsibility - were awarded 17,000 euro each (£15,200)in damages, and a total of 50,000 euro (£44,700) in costs and expenses.

A public inquiry into the case of Baha Mousa will conclude later this year.
