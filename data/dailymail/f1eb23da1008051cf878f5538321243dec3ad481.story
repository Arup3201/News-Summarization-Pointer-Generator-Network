Guts, veins, brains and hearts have been revealed in gruesome detail using next-generation body scanners.

The GE scanners, used by doctors in Florida, are currently involved in their first clinical trial aimed at making the process of medical scanning cheaper and easier.

Dubbed 'Revolution CT', they beam x-rays through a patient's body from which a computer can reconstruct a high-definition image, slice by slice.

The Buckinghamshire-based healthcare group claims that the scanner can build an image of a complete heart in just a single heartbeat.

The images and GIFS show the insides of a group of patients at West Kendall Baptist Hospital in south Florida, which is the first ever hospital to use the scanner.

The technique is known as X-ray computer tomography and is often used in hospitals to look for tumours, bone fractures and bleeding.

GE claims that the scanner can build an image of a complete heart in just a single heartbeat.

This is because it uses high-resolution and motion correcting technology similar to the image stabilisation features in personal cameras. 

Because it can scan faster, it can scan far more accurately, capturing clear images of moving organs.

While they are safe for patients who have pacemakers or metal inside their body, they require them to stay very still while the imaging is taking place.

But GE's scanners are different. 

The Revolution uses high-resolution and motion correcting technology similar to the image stabilisation features in personal cameras.

Because they can scan faster, they can scan far more accurately, capturing clear images of moving organs.

The team at West Kendall Baptist Hospital recently completed the world's first six-month clinical trial of the Revolution CT machine.

Local doctors said they were able to diagnose even the most challenging cardiac patients with erratic or high heartbeats and reduce the radiation dose for paediatric patients.

'According to our physicians, patient feedback about their experience with the Revolution CT has been uniformly positive,' said West Kendall Baptist Hospital CEO Javier Hernández-Lichtl.

'The advanced design definitely makes for a less intimidating, more comfortable patient experience, while yielding amazingly accurate and detailed images.'
