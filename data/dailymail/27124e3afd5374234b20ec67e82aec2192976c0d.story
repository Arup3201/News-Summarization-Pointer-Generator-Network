An 11-year-old boy found chained to a porch with a dead chicken around his neck is no 'sweet innocent kid' and likely harmed the bird to provoke the bizarre punishment, his foster brother said today.

The 20-year-old, who didn't want to be named, said his adopted parents Wanda Larson and Dorian Harper provided a 'loving and caring home' but the boy has severe psychological issues, including a history of being cruel to animals.

He said his parents' punishment, though he didn't condone it, was a last ditch attempt to control the child's behavior and protect the rest of the household.

Loving home: The 20-year-old son of Wanda Sue Larson and Dorian Lee Harper said on Tuesday that his parents provided a 'loving and caring home,' pictured

'Everyone says this is some sweet innocent kid when in actuality, he is not. He has been to counseling, he is on numerous heavy medications, but nothing has worked,' the brother told KHOU.

Harper, an emergency room nurse,
and Wanda Larson, a social worker, have been charged with 
intentional child abuse inflicting serious injury, false imprisonment 
and animal cruelty. The couple have been jailed and, at a brief court appearance Monday, their bond was set at $500,000 each.

The brother said he believes the chicken around the neck was supposed to 'shame the child.'

'There has to be something going on, between that child and that chicken,' he said. 'He either, one, didn't feed it and it died, or two, either he was out there harassing the chicken. He may have killed the chicken. This child has been known to be cruel to animals.'

He said the controversial discipline was his father's doing, as his mother, who would have put a stop to it, wasn't home at the time.

The brother explained the 11-year-old, who had lived at the home since he was six, was a problem child who was underweight because of a health problem, not because he was being mistreated.

'He would sneak out into the garage take raw meat out of the freezer, let it thaw overnight and next day go out there and eat it raw,' the man, who moved out of the home two years ago, when he turned 18, told KHOU. 'He has severe psychological issues.'

Charged: Wanda Sue Larson was arrested and charged Friday after a sheriff happened to stumble across the boy on the porch

'He was not allowed to carry his own lunch box because would eat what food is in his lunch and then, throw the lunch box away and say he didn't have lunch for the day.'

Union County Sheriff deputies plan to interview the other four children to get a clearer view of their living environment. But the brother insisted his parents cared for the children, all of whom are adopted except for the 11-year-old.

'Everyone assumed all five children in the home have been abused, that is not accurate. You ask all four of the children, they will say they lived in a loving and caring home,' he said.

The account contradicts claims from the 11-year-old's relatives who say they have tried for years to get DSS to look into the allegations of abuse.

Union County Sheriff Animal Services were at the house early this week gathering the property's remaining animals, including an estimated 75 fowl (chicken, ducks, guineas and peacock) three horses, three donkeys, two llamas, eight dogs and a hog.

The news comes after it was revealed the boy was routinely handcuffed to a piece of steel inside the farm house in Union Country by his foster parents, who were preventing him from running away.

Police in North Carolina have released more information on the shocking case - including how the smell of the feces-covered house would 'take your breath away' - as neighbors come forward describing how the boy would beg them for food and, at one point, was 'purple with cold' and 'looked pitiful'.

Alleged abuse: Dorian Lee Harper, pictured, was also arrested and charged with numerous offenses of abuse

Steve Mills lives on land adjacent to
that of the child's foster parents. The pair also have four adopted 
children aged from eight to 14.

All five have been placed in care 
outside Union County because Larson is a child protective services 
supervisor for that county's Department of Social Services.

She has received extra charges of willful failure to discharge her duty.

Neighbor
Mr Mills said in late July or early August a boy came running to his 
home 'crying and panicking and said ''Mister, can I have something to 
eat?'''

As Mr Mills' wife went to fix a sandwich, the other boys arrived.

'They told me he was the newest one (and) said they were going to take him back,' Mr Mills told Charlotte Observer. This boy 'was real small'.

'He
looked the smallest one out of the bunch. ... We just assumed he was 
kind of scared, (being in a) new house, new area, new siblings,' said Mr
Mills.

Joyce Bigham, who 
lives across the street, told ABC News the five children 'dress like 
orphans' and that the 11-year-old boy 'looked pitiful'.

Another
neighbor, who asked not to be named, said a boy appeared on her porch 
in May 2012 'purple with cold, with no coat, saying he was hungry'.

'When asked, he said he had no mother or father and didn't know where he lived,' she said.

The woman brought him inside and fed him a sandwich.

'It didn’t take him 10 seconds to eat it,' she said.

He
told her he was 10-years-old and that he had slept in her barn, behind 
her house, the night before. When she told him she would take him home, 
she said, he answered: 'No. I want to stay here.'

Her
daughter called 911 and a sheriff's deputy came out, spoke with the 
boy, made a phone call, then told him she'd take him home.

'He didn't refuse. He just went with her.'

The
neighbor said the deputy let her know she had returned him to his 
foster parents and said the man insisted the boy hadn't been missing 
more than 30 minutes. The neighbor believes it was the Harper-Larson home.

'I know that’s where she took him (although) you can’t see the house from the road.'

Union County Sheriff Eddie Cathey said said the condition of the house was 'terrible'.

'It was filthy, feces on the floor, holes in the wall,'  he said.

'The
bathroom, you could see from outside of the hall into the bathroom. 
Sink was trashed. No running water. The smell took your breath away.'

All
the children appeared to be suffering from malnutrition and Cathey said
that the first thing law enforcement did for them was buy them pizza.

Disturbing: Larson, a child services worker, lives at this property with four adopted children and the 11-year-old who was the only foster child

Authorities
stumbled across the disturbing situation after a deputy, who was 
responding to an animal services complaint at a neighboring property, 
saw the 11-year-old handcuffed to the porch.

He
approached the house and was confronted by Harper. The deputy asked for
Harper's identification and an explanation as to why the child was 
handcuffed to the porch.

According
to WBTV, one of the children opened the front door, releasing several 
large dogs who attacked the deputy. By the time he had the dogs under 
control, Harper had removed the child from the porch and left the dead 
chicken on a barrel in front of the house.

Other
officers arrived and following a search of the house, a criminal 
investigation was opened.

'It's just shocking,' Captain Ronnie Whitaker said on Saturday. 'It's just disturbing that anyone would treat a child in such a manner.'

It is unclear what prompted the use of the dead chicken and handcuffs on the boy. Whitaker said he could not disclose details from police interviews conducted as part of the investigation.
