Silhouetted against a sky of churning smoke and searing flame, firemen battle to contain an inferno.

This was the apocalyptic scene  yesterday as fire engulfed a recycling plant in what witnesses described as ‘hell on earth’. The cause? A single  Chinese lantern.

The lantern drifted down on to a bale of plastic and within minutes the flames were spreading through some 100,000 tons of recycling – worth £6million.

More than 200 firefighters have been tackling
 the blaze on an industrial estate in Smethwick, near Birmingham, 
in the biggest blaze West Midlands Fire Service has ever seen.

Inferno: Firefighters are silhouetted against the sea of flame caused by the burning mass of plastic recycling material in Smethwick, near Birmingham

The fire service said 200 firefighters were at the scene. 11 firefighters required medical treatment, three of them had to be sent to hospital

Three
 firefighters were hospitalised and a further eight were injured 
bringing the inferno - caused by a Chinese sky lantern that landed at 
the site - under control.

Shocked residents described 'apocalyptic' scenes 'like something from an action movie' that unfolded at 11pm on Sunday evening.

More than 35 fire engines as well as police and ambulance crews rushed to the scene at the J & A Young recycling plant where they battled throughout the night to control the flames.

The smouldering wreckage of the gutted building is still burning today and fire bosses warned the sheer scale of the blaze means it could burn all week.

Thick plumes of black smoke billowed up 
to 6,000ft in the air and could be seen over 80 miles away including 
Oxford, Coventry and by hundreds of motorists driving on the M40 and M1 
motorways towards London.

Area commander Steve Vincent, revealed it was the biggest blaze the UK's second largest fire service had seen in their 40-year history.

He said: 'A Chinese lantern was spotted on CCTV floating across and into the site and starting a fire in plastic bales.'

'We haven't evacuated any of the local residents because this is mainly an industrial area but we have had some minor injuries to some of our firefighters at the scene.' 

Choking: The fire created a 6,000ft tall spiral of smoke. Those living nearby were urged to keep their windows closed

Glare: The fire is believed to be the biggest to have ever struck the West Midlands. As well as the recycling plant, a factory unit is also involved

Teamwork: More than 35 fire engines from emergency services throughout the region were called to the raging fire

Blaze: There were fears the smoke would cause a delay to flights at Birmingham International Airport, although none have been reported so far

He added: 'We're working with other emergency services and they're all safely being treated.

'We will have major congestion in this area because we will be fighting this fire for the next few days. This is the largest fire that we've had in the West Midlands.

'It is a major fire and we've got support from surrounding fire brigades to help us deal with this.'

Vijith Randeniya, chief fire officer of West Midlands Fire and Rescue Service, has called for a review into the use of Chinese lanterns after the accident.

Huge mission: Three firefighters were hospitalised and a further eight were injured bringing the inferno caused by a Chinese sky lantern that landed at the site - under control

He said: 'My forensics people have been here from the start and have reviewed CCTV and and spoken to people and looked at the way the fire started and looking at the CCTV evidence, you can see a Chinese lantern floating gently, and then land and then eight minutes later you see the fire start.'

He said the Chief Fire Officers Association had previously called for a review of the use of Chinese lanterns and said it was time that 'sensible people have a sensible discussion' about the issue.

'We don't want to be party poopers and we know they are used in a lot of celebrations,' he said.

'What we want to do is make sure sensible people have a sensible discussion about the use of these things.

'Clearly there is a cause and an effect

'We have a situation where a fire has started here, £6 million worth of loss, started by one of these lanterns and that was eminently preventable.'

Fear: James Gillespie, 34, who lives near the site, said: 'There was this terrifying wall of flame when I looked out of my window, it was like the apocalypse had come'

An eyewitness described a series of explosions as the fire spread among the recyclable material

West Midlands Fire Service has confirmed 11 firefighters received treatment at the scene. A spokesman said three were taken to hospital - one had an eye injury and another suffered an ankle injury. It is not known what the third was hospitalised for but none of the injuries are serious

He added fire crews were expected to 
be on the site until at least tomorrow, but were having to use plant 
machinery to "break up" the bales of plastic to get at the heart of the 
fire.

One of the problems facing firefighters is having to extinguish molten pools of melted plastic, he said.

West Midlands Police closed nearby 
roads and brought in the force helicopter to relay images of the fire 
down to crews working on the ground.

Witness
 Steven Bolton, 29, from Smethwick, said: 'It was like a scene from a 
Hollywood blockbuster - I've never seen anything like it in my life.

'It was apocalyptic - there was just a wall of flames that extended as far as the eye could see.

'I could make out this silhouette of firefighters against this orange back drop.

'I could not believe what I was seeing. I've got a friend in Oxford who said he could see the smoke from the motorway.'

Ian Dangerfield, a 46-year-old 
documentary maker from West Bromwich, said: 'It was unbelievable. I 
could smell smoke and saw a huge cloud and I thought "there's no way 
that's a big thunderstorm".

'I went out the front door and could see the smoke going across the sky so I grabbed my camera. Police were stopping cars.'

'It was absolute chaos. I've never known anything like it in my life.'

Firefighters were expecting to be at the scene for several days damping down the flames

Area commander Steve Vincent said: 'This is the largest fire that we've had in the West Midlands. It is a major fire and we've got support from surrounding fire brigades to help us deal with this'

Smoke and ash even reached the city of Coventry, more than 20 miles away, with motorists in the area finding their vehicles covered with soot from the fire

Eye-witness Jack Awal said: 'It was like a scene from a movie. There were so many large explosions and loud bangs. It was like a firework display - there were loud crackles and bangs every few seconds' 

James Gillespie, 34, who lives near 
the site, said: 'It looked like images you see on TV of a massive forest
 fire in America. There was this terrifying wall of flame when I looked 
out of my window, it was like the apocalypse had come.'

Night
 shift worker Nikolai Kosecki, 30, from Smethwick said: 'I came outside 
for a break and saw flames and the fire engines arriving. Luckily it 
seemed like the fire service came quickly.'

Another witness Jack Awal said: 'It was like a scene from a movie. There were so many large explosions and loud bangs.

'It was like a firework display - there were loud crackles and bangs every few seconds.'
