The mother of the one-year-old baby who nose was bitten of by his father, according to police, to stop him from crying has finally broken her silence.

Angelika Riggins, 16, of Fairfield, California, says she is heartbroken after father Joshua Cooper, 18, also of Fairfield, was charged with biting his own baby's nose off out of frustration at the infant's crying.

'I didn't see no anger that morning,' Riggins told KGO. 'I didn't see no stress that morning. He was up playing with [Ta'jon].'

Evil act: Police say Joshua Cooper (left) bit off baby Ta'jon's (right) nose, and that he told then he did it to stop the baby from crying

'Waking up and seeing that my baby's 
right next to me in the hospital, it hurts,' she continued. '[It] hurts 
my feelings a lot... my heart is broken.'

The heartbroken mother is at a loss trying to come to grips with what has happened to her son.

The toddler was also discovered to have sustained a fractured skull and a brain hemorrhage, doctors told the station.

Riggins claims she does not know how Ta'jon got those additional injuries and denies ever having abused the tot.

Ta'jon has been transferred to state care, but Riggins has a Tuesday family court hearing to state her case for her son being allowed to come home when released from medical care, she told the station.

Doctors were able to reattach the nose, but the baby is still hospitalized while recovering.

Cooper has been charged with child cruelty and aggravated mayhem and is being held at Solano County Jail, according to CBS.

Fairfield Police received a call shortly after 8am Thursday morning from a 'hysterical' Riggins claiming her baby was bleeding from its nose.

He is now in a stable condition.

Fairfield Police said in a statement: 'The criminal investigation determined that the infantâ€™s father had bitten the childâ€™s nose off out of frustration from the infant crying. The investigation continues to determine how the infant sustained the skull fracture and brain hemorrhage.'
