She's a global megastar, fashion icon and entrepreneur who is so iconic  that she goes by just one name.

And now Beyonce has been named 2014's the world's highest-earning female musician by Forbes, raking in £73m this year thanks in part to her Mrs Carter Show tour and other endorsements.

But, clearly not content with her lot - and a reported net worth of £290m - the Run The World singer's empire is going to get even bigger and more lucrative in 2015.

The latest addition to brand Beyonce? A range of nail wraps inspired by the imagery in her most famous music videos and performances.

Thanks to her latest offering, fans can adorn their talons with patterns inspired by her music video looks, such as the tartan look in the Flawless video and neon signs in her Blow videos.

The mother-of-one worked on the range with the help of  her long-term manicurist, Lisa Logan, and Los Angeles-based nail company NCLA.

This isn't the 33-year-old's first venture into beauty. In fact, she is set to have the biggest-selling celebrity fragrance of 2014. 

The Drunk In Love singer's Rise perfume is expected to sell more than 750,000 units in the UK, which will apparently net her £1.5m.

Escentual.com CEO Rakesh Aggarwal said: 'Most celebrities earn around £2 per bottle sold of fragrance.

'Clearly deals vary in every case but generally it's around 8 to 10 per cent royalty on the profit, so with the huge number of sales for these celebrities in the top ten they are going to have a rather lucrative Christmas this year.' 

Business brains: Beyonce has teamed up with billionaire Topshop owner Sir Philip Green, centre with Cara Delevingne, to produce a range of high fashion sportswear

Indeed, the six editions of her fragrances are the world's best-selling celebrity fragrance line, with sales worth over £250m. 

The global style icon is also sure to get a bank balance boost from her upcoming fashion collaboration.

Beyonce, mother to Blue Ivy Carter, her daughter with husband Jay Z, has teamed up with billionaire Topshop owner Sir Philip Green to produce a range of high fashion sportswear.

The singer, who made her name with Destiny’s Child, one of the best-selling girl groups of all time, has formed a joint venture called Parkwood TopShop Athletic producing ‘global athletic street-wear’.

A spokesman explained that fashionable sportswear has broken out of the gym and is being increasingly worn as a casual style on the streets.

The brand will encompass clothing, footwear and accessories across dance, fitness and sports categories.

Green said: ‘We have been looking at this category as fashion-inspired fitness develops, and know that this is right in our customers’ heartland.’

Beyonce said: ‘I have always loved Topshop for their fashion credentials and forward thinking.’

Green claims Beyonce will be involved with all aspects of the partnership.

She certainly has expertise; the singer launched a women's fashion line, House of Deréon, with her mother Tina Knowles in 2005. 

The fashion house also encompassed a junior apparel label, Sasha Fierce for Deréon, for back-to-school fashion. 

She also collaborated with shoe company, House of Brands, on a range of footwear in 2005.

Over the years, Beyonce has had deals with American Express, Pepsi, Nintendo DS and L'Oréal. 

So successful was 2014 for Beyonce that she pulled in £73m thanks to her Mrs Carter Show tour, a surprise album and numerous endorsements. This put her at number two on Forbes' highest-paid musicians list, just behind producer Dr Dre.

It seems that Queen Bey really does Run The World.
