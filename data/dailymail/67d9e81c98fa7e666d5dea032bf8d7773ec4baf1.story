Two of the sharpest dressers in football, Sky Sports’ new mega-signing, Thierry Henry, and the experienced Graeme Souness, were paired for the Frenchman’s much-anticipated Super Sunday debut.

Nothing off the peg there, and after a fortnight of Henry’s arrival being heralded with a generous slab of on-screen fromage — and presenter Ed Chamberlin not looking too shabby either — they got down to business.

An early, and legitimate, test of whether a great player turned pundit will deliver on air is when asked to reflect on the fortunes of his former club. Henry’s new team-mates, Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher, both passed that test with flying colours.

Henry, alongside the experienced Graeme Souness, looked dapper as he spoke about his old club Arsenal 

So when Chamberlin chipped up a lunchtime tester on whether Arsenal have gone backwards in the past 12 months, it was significant that Henry didn’t duck.

‘Yes. It looks like a team that looks to finish fourth, which is not Arsenal. You want to win the title. They need to defend better, and not just the back four. It needs to be a team effort. They bought Mertesacker but does he have protection?

‘They are not far but they are missing a big piece... a Vieira and a Gilberto Silva.'

Just to prove how well-settled he is as a pundit, Souness cutely offered: ‘Would you like your daughter to date any of the Arsenal players? They are a team of son-in-laws. All nice guys. You need a few rascals.’

Henry believes Arsenal lack a midfield player to protect the back four like former skipper Patrick Vieira

Henry also spoke highly of former team-mate Gilberto Silva on his Sky Sports punditry debut

Previewing the day’s hors d’ouevre, West Ham versus Hull City, Henry pinpointed the Hammers’ former Gunner Alex Song as a player ‘who would improve Arsenal’.

Henry is understated but his studio work for the BBC in last summer’s World Cup showed he can deliver intelligent, incisive analysis.

A goalless first half at Upton Park and Henry gave a view of life up front as he sees it.

Hull’s Sone Aluko stays on his feet when challenged from behind by James Tomkins in the penalty area. ‘If you touch me I go down in the box… you stick your leg out like that from behind when you have been beaten you’re looking for trouble. It should have been a penalty, if he went down, which he didn’t.’

In the build-up to the big game at the Etihad, Henry praised City’s David Silva and opined that Alexis Sanchez’s form for Arsenal stems from getting regular touches of the ball, unlike at Barcelona.

As Arsenal gave an outstanding first-half display to lead through Santi Cazorla’s penalty, Henry pinpointed how the away side had neutralised Silva.

‘There is always a man between the ball and David Silva.’

His view on the penalty? ‘It was for me.’ And for Souness, too, to be fair.

Arsenal completed a masterful 2-0 win and Henry’s focused on Arsenal’s tellingly different approach.

‘Usually Arsenal win games by passing and being brilliant with the ball. Not today. They defended well as a unit… 34% (possession) was enough to win.’

It was a match, Henry suggested, in which Arsenal showed ‘commitment, desire and togetherness’.

Qualities that Sky Sports hope they will get in abundance from their new star signing. On this showing he looks tailor-made for the role.
