A 19-year-old woman is lucky to be alive after falling about 50 feet down a notoriously dangerous Los Angeles cliff where five hikers have been killed in the last three years.

The fall was captured on a cellphone in Eaton Canyon, Pasadena, about 6pm Wednesday.

The woman was attempt to scale down an embankment when she lost her footing, KTLA reported.

After taking a nasty tumble down the steep terrain, the hiker was luckily able to grab hold of a small tree sticking out of the cliff that broke her fall.

Safe: This tree luckily broke the woman's fall, and she was able to hold onto a branch until help arrived

She then waited as a rescuer was lowered from a helicopter and took her away in a safety harness.

The woman was then transported to hospital.

Earlier this week, the U.S. Forest Service shut down some of the trails in Eaton Canyon that they deemed too dangerous for hikers.

Five people have died since 2011, and dozens more required rescuing.

Officials say the shale of the cliffs is so soft it breaks away easily.

'We're always up there plucking people off the side of the cliff,' Sgt. Phil Barth of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department told KTLA.

Violators entering the no access zone beginning on Friday could face a $5,000 fine and up to six months in jail.
