Ronaldinho rolled back the years to score an outstanding free-kick for Queretaro during his new side's encounter against Atlas on Tuesday evening.

The Brazilian forward curled the ball into the top corner from 19 yards in a similar fashion to what he became accustomed to doing while he was at Barcelona and AC Milan.

Ronaldinho, who has now scored two goals in three games for Mexican outfit Queretaro, had a pretty eventful night as he was approached by a supporter during the encounter.

A fan ran onto the pitch to greet the 34-year-old before asking Ronaldinho to sign his Brazil shirt.

Ronaldinho duly obliged by stopping to print his autograph onto the pitch invader's top.

Queretaro went onto lose the match at Atlas' Estadio Jalisco, despite Ronaldinho's late stoppage time goal, leaving the Mexican side seventh in the table with four wins from 11 games.
