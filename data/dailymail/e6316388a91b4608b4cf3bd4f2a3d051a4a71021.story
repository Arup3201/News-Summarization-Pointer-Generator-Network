Tube drivers have been offered a bonus of £350 for working on Boxing Day, on top of their salary and paid holiday allowances.

The deal has been reached in the long running row between London Underground bosses and drivers over pay and working hours over the festive season.

Boxing Day Tube services have been plunged into chaos in recent years because of industrial action by drivers.

London Underground said the agreement
 was self-financing because of changes agreed with unions to train 
drivers' work and conditions.

Phil Hufton, LU's chief operating officer, said: 'In the last three years, train operators decided to take industrial action despite the fact we have a long-standing agreement with all trade unions which covers working arrangements on Bank Holidays, including Boxing Day.

'We have been in discussions with the relevant unions representing the train operators in order to resolve issues around working Boxing Day.

'An agreement was reached with the unions, resulting in a genuine productivity deal.

'In exchange for changes that would give greater flexibility in the longer term, we have agreed to make an additional payment on the proviso that it would be a completely self-financing deal.

'This cost-neutral deal will be made possible by productivity savings from various parts of the trains operations.'

Conservative London Assembly Member Richard Tracey said Transport for London was paying a 'bung' to drivers, adding: 'Since when has a £46K starting salary and 43 days of holiday a year not been enough for Tube drivers? 

'This proves that even when strike action does not go ahead, the threat is often used by union bosses to make Londoners suffer.

'The Government needs to urgently ban Tube strikes and replace them with an independent mediation process which protects workers' rights.'

Rail Maritime and Transport union general secretary Bob Crow said: 'If Tory politicians think that we are going to take any lectures from them on Tube worker pay and conditions in the week when their colleagues in Parliament have just landed themselves an 11 per cent pay increase then they need to rapidly acquaint themselves with life back in the real world.'
