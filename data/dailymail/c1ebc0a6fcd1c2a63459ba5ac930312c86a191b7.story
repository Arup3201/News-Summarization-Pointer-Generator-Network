Shaun Maloney’s move from Wigan Athletic to Leicester City is off after contract negotiations broke down.

The Scotland international had looked as if he’d return to the Premier League this month after the Latics agreed to let him leave for £1million.

But manager Malky Mackay has revealed Maloney wasn’t able to thrash out a deal with the Foxes.

‘Shaun went to talk personal terms and those talks have broken down,’ Maloney said.

‘Shaun is back as my player again. I’ve spoken to him this morning (Friday) and he’s here until July unless something changes.’

The 31-year-old had interest from Celtic and Chicago Fire among other clubs, but now appears set to stay at the DW Stadium.

That’ll come as a huge boost for Mackay, who needs as much quality as possible in the Championship run-in. They are just three points off the foot of the division and six beneath safety.
