When young people are taken into care, the hope is that they will be protected by the system.

Sadly, we already know there are children who are catastrophically failed by this safety net, ending up in even more toxic situations than the ones they were plucked from.

For Marni Mulholland, from London, a life in care was far from a safe haven.

Victim: Marni Mulholland (not her real name), pictured here, is now 42. She is sharing the story of how she was raped and groomed into prostitution, in the hope that is will raise awareness

When she was sent to a children’s home, she claims she was routinely abused and raped by a man everyone else trusted - a social worker.

After years of sexual abuse at the hands of Matthew [all names have been changed to protect identities], Marni eventually 
turned to prostitution in her late teens.

Now, 20 years on, she has 
decided to come forward about her past in an honest - and at times 
distressing - memoir, in the hope of raising awareness about child 
grooming.

‘I started a diary about what happened a couple of years ago, and that eventually turned into the book,’ Marni tells MailOnline.

‘Leading a quiet life would be far less painful but I feel compelled to talk about this. It’s still very hard for me because it is still very much on the surface.

‘But I want to lift the lid about child grooming and the abuse I suffered in the children’s home.'

Marni grew up on a tough council estate in West London, where she says she was victimised by other girls.

By the 
time she was 14, her mother had suffered several mental episodes (she 
was later diagnosed with schizophrenia) and was unable to look after her, so Marni was sent to a 
children’s home.

The home was meant to be a safe place for the young girl. And
 at first it was.

But then a social worker in his 30s began plying her 
with gifts and showering her with attention, gaining Marni’s trust, a 
tactic she now refers to as ‘slow-burning grooming.’

Within months Marni had formed a strong 
attachment to Matthew and consented to having sex with him. At the 
time, she saw nothing wrong with their 20-year age gap and the fact she 
was just 14.

‘Matthew and the other social workers worked in shifts, often staying the night,’ Marni explains.

‘I
 don’t think anyone had any idea what was going on. I didn’t tell them 
because I was ashamed and I didn’t think I’d be believed anyway. I don’t
 think they had any inkling at all.’

Courage: Marni says talking about her horrific past is difficult, but if she can help just one girl who is being abused, then it will make her happy

Marni says their sexual relationship continued for years. They would have sex in Matthew’s office, his home, in public toilets and at the children’s home. All the while, Matthew gave Marni presents and cash in return for her body.

Marni was re-housed and given her own council flat at the age of 18. She went to art college, but by this point, she had already begun prostituting herself.

She describes in the book how sex for money felt normal for her, even though she knew on some level that it was very wrong.

‘I was so ashamed so never told anyone or made friends,’ she says. ‘I’ve been ashamed all my life. It’s only very recently I’ve been able to talk about it.’

However, by the time she was ‘19 or 20,' Marni started to realise that the life she was living was far from normal.

‘I was having very dysfunctional relationships, I was promiscuous,’ she says. ‘I realised my problem was Matthew. And I realised it was wrong.

‘When 
you’re an adult you realise that isn’t right. I was older and wiser. One day, when I was around 19 or 20, I found the courage to 
go into the police and tell them about it but it took a long time to get
 to that stage.’

She made her complaint in 1990, when she was and the process dragged on for 'around' three years, according to Marni, who has difficulty remembering specific dates.

Marni eventually decided to withdraw her complaint in 1993 as reliving her past proved too painful.

‘It’s very hard to sit there and relive your experiences to a complete stranger,’ she says.

‘You have to remember the day, the week, the weather. It’s so difficult and you can see why often court cases collapse.

'You see why the victim is so frustrated. It’s like being abused all over again. People who come forward now are very brave.

Marni's allegations against Matthew were never heard in court, and he was never convicted.

At around that time, she was moving in moneyed circles in Chelsea and Sloane Square, still a prostitute and taking drugs and drinking heavily.

It wasn't until she met Josh, now her husband, in 2001, that she was able to break her unhealthy patterns of behaviour.

She credits Josh for helping her rebuild her life. 

‘When I told him about my past he was very understanding,’ she says. ‘He’s very strong and grounded.

‘He says he loves me for what I am, tells me that my past isn’t my fault and he gives me a lot of strength.

‘If I saw Matthew now I’d think he was a sad old man. I see him as weak. I have the strength and power now and I wouldn’t be afraid of him, I don’t live in fear anymore because I think he’s pathetic.

‘It took time to build my life up. It’s like an invisible tattoo or a scar – it never heals. But time helps. My life now is happy. I’m in a very good place. I have a loving family and a network of supportive, understanding friends.’

Marni married Josh in 2002, and their first child, a daughter, was born the same year.

In 2005, they had a son and, in 2007, left London for the west of England, where the family still lives.

Now Marni wants to share her story so she can help other girls who are being abused and groomed.

‘I want to shout from the rooftops how terrible grooming is and how damaging it can be,’ she says.

‘It’s calculated and slow-burning and evil and it can muck up your whole life if you let it. If there is just one 14-year-old out there that I can help, I will be happy.

‘Being abused never goes away, you just find a way to cope with it,’ she says. ‘It’s always there, but I won’t let him win. I’m strong now.’
