Everton's rivals are taking increasing interest in midfielder James McCarthy as the Goodison Park club's Premier League plight worsens.

Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United are all monitoring the stylish 24-year-old who signed from Wigan in a £13million deal.

They each want a proven midfielder and McCarthy is on their lists as they assess summer targets.

The midfielder, pictured in action against Arsenal on Sunday, joined Everton in the summer of 2013 for £13m

McCarthy signed a five-year contract on summer deadline day in 2013 but is not one of Everton's big earners and the nature of the last-minute negotiations meant assurances were given that his deal would be revised as his Goodison career progressed.

However, though other Everton players have since opened discussions over new terms, McCarthy has yet to be approached.

Tim Howard, Seamus Coleman, Ross Barkley and John Stones all agreed new deals last year with manager Roberto Martinez, who himself signed a new deal last June, seeking to maintain a long-term core to his squad.

McCarthy has not been approached about a new contract despite his good form for the Toffees

McCarthy, a Republic of Ireland international, has matured into one of the most consistent Premier League players and shown his ability on the international and European stage.

In Everton's 4-1 Europa League rout of Wolfsburg earlier this season he had a pass completion rate of 98 per cent.

He is highly regarded at Everton and his influence on the team was sorely missed when he was out with a hamstring injury; in the 13 games Everton played without him, they won just one.

Arsenal and Tottenham have both watched him since his return to the fold but were put off January bids knowing Everton would refuse all offers.

Everton's faltering season though has given them a sense a deal could be brokered in the summer. Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin remains on their list of options too.

United have concerns that Roma's Kevin Strootman may not recover quickly from his latest knee surgery and are assessing other options across Europe. 

McCarthy has over 150 Premier League games under his belt already and at 24 has his best years ahead of him.
