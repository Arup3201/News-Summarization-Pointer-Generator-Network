The 911 operator who answered the now-famous May 6th call from one of the women held for a decade by Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro was reprimanded on Friday for hanging up on her before police arrived.

Public criticism was leveled against the operator's seemingly unsympathetic tone with the very excited Amanda Berry, once the audio of the call was made public by authorities.

Berry made the call to police after she and her 6-year-old daughter, fathered by Castro, were rescued with the help of neighbors four months ago. Police then found Michelle Knight, who was abducted in 2002 and Gina DeJesus, abducted in 2004, in the home.

Castro, who pleaded guilty in August 
to raping, kidnapping and torturing the women, was found hanging from a 
bed sheet in his cell Tuesday night.

His body has since been claimed by 
his family who are planning a private service and burial for the man who
was one month into a prison term of life plus 1,000 years.

According
to a disciplinary letter sent to four-year veteran dispatcher Jack 
Purdy, the City of Cleveland found he 'improperly handled a 911 call 
from a kidnap victim and failed to remain on the line with the victim 
until responding officers arrived on the scene.'

The
dispatcher had pleaded 'no contest' at a hearing last month. On Friday,
he was informed that a letter of discipline would be placed in the his 
personnel file for three years.

Dead: Ariel Castro's body is set to be claimed by his family today after he hanged himself in his prison cell on Tuesday

Bureau
of Communications Commander Thomas Stacho said in the letter to Purdy 
that he could have demonstrated "more empathy and could have been more 
compassionate in your dealing with Ms. Berry."

In
a recording of the 911 call, Berry is heard telling the operator, 'I've
been kidnapped and I've been missing for 10 years, and I'm, I'm here, 
I'm free now,' and seemingly pleading with the operator 'I'm Amanda 
Berry. I've been on the news for the last 10 years,' with the dispatcher
responding, 'I got, I got that, dear.'

'Without
question, you should have kept her on the line as I believe that that 
simple, required act would have enhanced her sense of safety,' Stacho 
said.

It came after MailOnline revealed on Tuesday that Castro's 
victims have mixed feelings about the suicide of the man they spent ten 
years of their life with due to the warped bond they shared with him.

Freed: Amanda Berry, left, Gina DeJesus, center, and Michelle Knight, 
right, have all spoken out about recovering from their horrific ordeal 
being kidnapped, raped and tortured by Castro. They have declined to comment on his suicide

Relatives
of Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight said the girls are happy they can 
finally put the traumatic episode beside them but also experienced some 
confusion when they heard the news.

Jackie Figaro Roman, an aunt of Gina DeJesus, told MailOnline that both girls were going through a ‘mixture of emotions’.

She
said: ‘There’s so many mixed feelings about it. Gina is a little 
confused. We are trying to protect her because we have to remember, she 
was a 14-year-old girl (when she was kidnapped).

'But Gina and Michelle won’t have to think about him because he’s not around any more.’

She also revealed that Gina’s mother Nancy has been able to move beyond her anger and is already pitying Castro.

'Nancy probably feels bad for him. We
have a very strong, spiritual family and so does Ariel Castro. She 
doesn’t care about him, she’s just happy her daughter is home. She 
doesn’t feel any anger.'

Amanda Berry - whose daughter is fathered by Castro - has also not commented on his death.

Though
Castro serially abused the women physically, emotionally, and sexually 
on a daily basis, they were also so badly manipulated they developed 
'Stockholm syndrome' - slowly 'bonding' with their captor in gratitude 
for rare small favors he would grant them.

His suicide will have come as a slap in 
the face to his victims and their families, robbing them of 
the justice that had brought some form of closure to their ten-year 
nightmare.

Lonely death: This is an isolation cell at Correctional Reception Center in Orient, Ohio, like the one where Castro hanged himself Tuesday

Castro
was being housed alone in an isolation unit for his protection, where 
he would be checked every 30 minutes.  Prison officials said he hanged 
himself with a sheet during a break between inspections.

Initially,
Castro was being checked on every ten minutes, but this stopped in June
after he was deemed not to be a risk to himself and taken off suicide 
watch. An autopsy confirmed his death was suicide by hanging.

Castro's attorneys tried 
unsuccessfully to have an independent psychological examination of the 53-year-old 
done at the Cuyahoga County Jail before he was turned over to state 
authorities following his conviction.

A full investigation is underway as 
to how he was able to take his own life while under the watchful eye of 
prison guards - who said he was always calm and cooperative with them.

While
his defense attorneys said they are suspicious as to why their client 
would have committed suicide just one month into his prison term, 
Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy J. McGinty issued a scathing 
statement.

'These degenerate molesters are cowards. They con and capture vulnerable
children,' he said.

'This man couldn't take, for even a month, a small portion of 
what he had dished out for more than a decade.

'Let
this be a message to other child kidnappers: There will be a heavy 
price to pay when you are caught. You won't enjoy the captive side of 
the bars.'

As well as his four elder children, 
Castro fathered a young girl to victim Amanda Berry. It is unclear if 
the child knows her father is dead.

Castro
was jailed after keeping Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight
captive in unimaginable conditions in his house for ten years.

When prison guards found Castro hanging in his 8x12 foot cell on Tuesday, they immediately began trying to resuscitate him.  

He
was taken to Ohio State University Medical Center, where he was 
pronounced dead about an hour and a half later - shortly before 11pm.

It
costs nearly $25,000 a year on average to house a prison inmate in 
Ohio.

The cost to house Castro, who was kept in high security, would 
likely have been much higher.

Castro's family - he has a son and three daughters by his ex-wife - were informed of his suicide about 1am.

A
spokeswoman for the the Ohio Department of Corrections said the agency 
will make a full investigation of Castro's suicide to determine whether 
regulations were followed and if anything could have been done to 
prevent his death.

The end: Castro acknowledged in court last month that he would die in prison
