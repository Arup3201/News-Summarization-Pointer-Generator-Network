Boys as well as girls should be given the HPV jab to prevent rising rates of cancer, according to experts.

The vaccine is currently given to girls aged 12 and 13 to protect against the human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer.

But the virus is actually thought to trigger 5 per cent of all cancers worldwide including those affecting 2,000 men a year.

A committee of experts working for the Department of Health are currently deciding whether boys aged 12 to 13 should also be offered the vaccine.

Campaigners say it would save lives, avoid needless suffering and spare the NHS millions of pounds in treatment costs.

The vaccines would be offered on a voluntary basis to boys at school and would cost the health service up to £22 million annually.

HPV is spread via sexual contact and causes cervical cancer in women as well as cancer of the throat, anus and penis.

The experts – the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation – met yesterday are expected to make a final decision next month.

Girls aged 12 and 13 have been offered the jab on a voluntary basis since 2008 and around 80 per cent have it.

Peter Baker, Campaign Director of HPV Action.org,  said it was 'blatantly unfair' that women were protected from cancers and other diseases caused by HPV infection while men were not.

‘Men will continue to die from HPV-related diseases unless the government acts to extend the national vaccination programme to all adolescent boys,’ he said.

‘This would only cost about £20-£22 million a year and, in the long run, save the money spent by the NHS on treatment as well as reducing human suffering.

‘If parents knew that their sons as well as their daughters could be protected from the virus that causes 5 per cent of all cancers, then I'm sure most would also agree.'

Earlier this month MPs from the All-Party Parliamentary Groups on Cancer, Dentistry, Sexual and Reproductive Health, Men's Health and HIV and Aids said more than 2,000 cases of cancer in men each year in the UK were caused by HPV.

In an open letter they wrote: ‘The long-term savings in treatment and care of men with HPV-related diseases would considerably outweigh the extra cost (about £20 million a year) of extending the programme.’

Dr Kate Soldan, head of HPV surveillance at Public Health England, the Department of Health agency in charge of vaccines said it would provide ‘few additional benefits.’ 

The Department of Health is currently debating whether to extend the vaccination programme to include boys aged 12 and 13, to help protect against HPV (pictured). The virus is linked to cancer of the throat, anus and penis - affecting around 2,000 men each year
