 Gardener’s growing interest in exotic and foreign plants is helping to save the threatened bumblebee, ecologists say.

Growing a variety of plants creates a diverse ecosystem in a garden, which scientists say provides bees and other pollinating insects with a range of food sources.

A new study suggests that the most common species of British bumblebees are not fussy about a plant’s origin when searching for nectar and pollen.

A survey has found that British bumblebees have no preference on the type of flower they are extracting pollen from, making display gardens with oriental and exotic flowers a lifesaver for the species

Academics conducted a three-month survey in the gardens of a residential street in Plymouth.

They found that of the six garden plants most commonly visited by bumblebees, only one - the Foxglove - was a British native.

Common foreign plants favoured by the bees included trailing bellflower, which originates in the mountains of the Balkans, Hebe Franciscana, a hybrid bush bred from plants from New Zealand and South America, Deutzia shrubs from China, and lilac from California. 

The team, from Plymouth University, found that bees simply visited plants in proportion to flower availability.

While study showed that most bees are not fussy about the origin of their nectar, some species have a preference for British plants, such as the long-tongued garden bumblebee, which chooses British and European plants for 78 per cent of its flower visits

Ecologist Dr Mick Hanley, lead author of the study published in the journal Annals of Botany, said this encouraged gardeners to cast their net wide when choosing what to cultivate.

‘Urban gardens are increasingly recognised for their potential to maintain or even enhance biodiversity,’ he said.

‘In particular, the presence of large densities and varieties of flowering plants supports a number of pollinating insects whose range and abundance has declined as a consequence of agricultural intensification and habitat loss.

‘By growing a variety of plants from around the world, gardeners ensure that a range of food sources is available for many different pollinators.

‘But until now we have had very little idea about how the origins of garden plants actually affect their use by our native pollinators.’

The study showed that while most bees are not fussy about the origin of their nectar, some species have a preference for British plants.

The long-tongued garden bumblebee, for example, chose British and European plants for 78 per cent of its flower visits, a preference developed over thousands of years.

Dr Hanley said that as a general rule bees would go wherever there are flowers available.

But if native plants such as the foxglove disappeared completely, some species would be at risk.

He said: ‘In addition to growing truly native plants like foxgloves, where possible, gardeners can help native pollinators by setting aside a small area to allow native brambles, vetches, dead nettles, and clovers to grow.

‘But as long as some native species are available in nearby allotments, parks, or other green spaces, a combination of commonly-grown garden plants from all around the globe will help support our urban bumblebees for future generations.’
