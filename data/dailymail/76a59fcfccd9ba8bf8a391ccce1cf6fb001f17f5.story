Two Downing Street police officers have been sacked after obscene images were found on their mobile phones during the Plebgate investigation.

The officers were members of the Diplomatic Protection Group (SO6), who were tasked with providing armed protection at Downing Street, foreign diplomats and visiting heads of states. 

The men, aged 34 and 36 faced a misconduct hearing on Thursday before the Directorate of Professional Standards, and were dismissed.

Operation Agnes was launched after pornography was found on several officers' mobile phones during the Plebgate probe involving former Government Chief Whip, Andrew Mitchell, (pictured leaving Downing Street)

An investigation into members of SO6 as a result of the Plebgate scandal involving former Government chief whip Andrew Mitchell discovered obscene material on several officers' phones. 

One officer, James Addison was sacked in June 2014 after he admitted sharing extreme pornography with fellow officers using his mobile phone. 

After the pornography was discovered, the Met launched Operation Agnes and investigated the conduct of 14 officers, including Addison. 

Officer B, who is 34 had been arrested on December 19, 2013 but was not charged with any criminal office. It was determined in February 2014 that he would not face criminal action. 

Officer D, who is 36, was arrested in January and questioned under caution, but faced no criminal charges. 

Instead, the Metropolitan Police decided that both men should face a professional standards investigation where they were accused with discreditable conduct and authority.

Both officers admitted gross misconduct at the disciplinary hearing on Thursday.

The hearing's chair accepted the pleas and they were dismissed without notice. 

A third officer, Officer C, resigned from the Metropolitan Police in August and a misconduct matter against him has been kept on file.  

Ten further officers were later investigated by the DPS for receiving obscene images and failing to report the matter to a superior officer. 

The Metropolitan Police investigated 14 officers over the pornography allegations, with three sacked

The officers, eight of whom were with the DPG and two from Territorial Policing, have been cleared of any misconduct allegations and are no longer on restricted duties. 

The Metropolitan Police said that the dismissals of James Addison and Officers B and D conclude the investigation.  

Detective Chief Superintendent Alaric Bonthron, said: 'The sharing of these images is completely unacceptable. Officers are expected to uphold the standards of the Met Police and when they fail to do so - they will be investigated. 

'Where officers fail to act within the law it undermines the trust and confidence the public have in the service as a whole.'

Earlier this year, Addison pleaded guilty to 11 charges of distributing extreme pornography from his mobile phone. He was fined £6,000 at Westminster Magistrates' Court. 

Addison sent the images to his colleagues between February and June 2013 while he was on duty.
