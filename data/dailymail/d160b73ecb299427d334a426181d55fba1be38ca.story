Six small monkeys have been found dead at a zoo in Portland just two days after they first arrived.

The cotton-topped tamarin monkeys were part of a group of nine that arrived at the Oregon Zoo in Portland, United States on May 22.

They were being kept in quarantine because they were new, according to Zoo spokesman Hova Najarian.

But just two days after they arrived, veterinary staff found six of the monkeys dead but the remaining three appear to be healthy.

The healthy monkeys include a five-week-old baby, who is being monitored closely.

Mr Najarian said that the deaths could be attributed to necropsy, however, results were inconclusive and the zoo awaits a pathology report on tissue samples.

Metro spokesman Jim Middaugh told The Oregonian that the monkeys came from the East Coast, but he did not know exactly where from.

The Oregon zoo has faced a series of problems in recent months.

Kim Smith, the director of the zoo and veterinarian Mitch Finnegan were fired in early May following an investigation that found sloppy mistakes in the treatment of an orangutan that died in January.
