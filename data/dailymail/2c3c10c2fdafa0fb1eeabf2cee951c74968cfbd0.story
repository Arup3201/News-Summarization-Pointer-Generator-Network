It's 23 years since the bodies of Clinton Speedy, 16 and Evelyn Greenup, four, were discovered in the tiny town of Bowraville, Australia and all that remained of Colleen Walker, her clothes, bagged and weighted down with rocks in the Nambucca River.

All the victims were indigenous and the families say if they had been white and living in suburbia instead of being black and from an Aboriginal mission, the murders would have been solved long ago.

Now a senior homicide detective is about to give evidence at a parliamentary inquiry that a serial killer operating in the country town where the three children disappeared in the early 1990s escaped justice because police  failed to properly investigate.

Submissions to the inquiry will say the families were failed and assumptions were made that when Aboriginal children disappeared they had just  'gone walkabout'.

Evelyn Greenup, four, (left) and Colleen Walker, 16 (right) both went missing parties on the Aboriginal mission outside the  Australian town of Bowraville in 1990. Local police suggested the kindergarten pupil was a runaway, but her partially decomposed body was found the following year on a dirt track near the river, in which Ms Walker's clothes were found weighted down with rocks

After Clinton Speedy-Duroux, 16,  disappeared  in 1991 from a local man's caravan where he and his girlfriend had been sleeping, his body was found two weeks later dumped along the same bush track as four-year-old Evelyn Greenup. No attempt was made to conceal either body and both appeared to have suffered significant blows to the head

Detective Inspector Gary Jubelin of the New South Wales Police will tell the NSW Law & Justice Parliamentary Committee in relation to the Bowraville Murders on Thursday that the three child murder cases should be considered together and that there would be a reasonable chance of identifying and convicting the 'serial killer'.

One suspect in 1991 was a local tannery worker, Jay Hart, a white man then in his twenties. Hart was charged with the murders of Clinton Speedy and Evelyn Greenup.

After a judge, Justice Badgery-Parker of the NSW Supreme Court, ruled that Hart could not be tried for the two murders together, Hart was tried and acquitted of the murder of Clinton Speedy in 1994, and of the murder of Evelyn Greenup in 2006. Nobody was charged with the murder of Colleen Walker.

Inspector Jubelin's submission, along with others from Aboriginal language and cultural experts, and the victims' families will point to a lack of forensic evidence being gathered at the time of the murders, of the disappearances not being taken seriously and the two cases which were prosecuted being treated 'apathetically'.

A community divided: The white community in the tiny country town of Bowraville did not mix with the local Aboriginals from the mission on the road out of town until a local man started taking alcohol and cannabis to mission parties with indigenous people

Evelyn Greenup's mother did not realise the four-year-old was missing until late the following day after she was apparently kidnapped from a bedroom. The girl's body wasn't found till months later

Leonie Duroux, the sister-in-law of Clinton Speedy-Duroux, organised a protest outside NSW Parliament House last November which led to the inquiry. She said the treatment of the murders was a 24-year-old sham and had been so from the start.

'From the time they disappeared it has been [a sham],' she said. 'I am a white person, and if I went missing the police wouldn't go and ask if I'd just gone walkabout, or like they did of Colleen Walker's mother if she might have gone because she'd just got pregnant.

'They also asked her if she was actually Collen's mother, because Colleen was light-skinned.

'There was no forensic evidence taken from the house from which Evelyn disappeared and she was treated as a runaway. She was four years old, and had left behind a shoe.

'Clinton's disappearance was taken a little but more seriously because his body was found three weeks later. Even so, there was an eye witness  who identified the man standing over Clinton's body on the road at the time he disappeared and that was taken by the police but not used.

'There are families and communities in many places and towns who are still suffering and paying for the mistakes made by police all these years later.'

The first victim of the Bowraville killer was Colleen Walker, who in September 1990 arrived from her home 60 km north, to the community of around 150 Aboriginal and 750 white people.

Few of the white townsfolk fraternised with the Aborigines on the mission, except Jay Hart.

A police officer will tell the inquiry that the murders of Evelyn Greenup (above) and teenagers Clinton Speedy and Colleen Walker should be tried as serial killings in the one court hearing

On her first or second day in Bowraville, the 16-year-old attended a party at the mission, at which there was alcohol and cannabis, known as 'yarni' .

Walker got very drunk and failed to meet her friends to take the 3am train out. Her mother did not find out she was missing until days later.

The following month, on October 3, after another party at the mission, a drunk Rebecca Stadhams took her three children, including four-year-old Evelyn to their father, Billy Greenup's house,but found he was too inebriated to mind them.

Back at her mother's house, Stadhams fell asleep with the children only to wake up the next morning to find Evelyn gone. Assuming the child had walked down in daylight to see her father, Stadhams didn't realise Evelyn was missing until she caught up with Billy Greenup later in the day.

In January 1991, Clinton Speedy was visiting from his home in the country town of Tenterfield, five hours north-west of Bowraville. Speedy attended another party at the mission.

The teenager disappeared and the discovery of his body dumped on a dirt track seven kilometres out of Bowraville sparked the first suspicions by police of a murder at the mission.

The next remains to be discovered were when a fisherman snagged Collen Walker's clothes in the river near that track and, thereafter, Evelyn Greenup's decomposed body.

Police charged Jay Thomas Hart with the murders of Clinton Speedy and Evelyn Greenup, having identified similarities in the deaths and identifying a possible sexual motive, in that Hart allegedly wanted to have sex with someone in each victim's company at the time of their disappearance.

A Supreme Court judge decided to try the cases separately, making evidence about the Collen Walker and Evelyn Greenup deaths inadmissable at Hart's 1994 trial for Clinton Speedy's murder. Hart was acquitted.

More than a decade later, Hart was tried and acquitted for the Greenup murder.

Inspector Jubelin, who was not part of the original murder investigations, took up the case in 1997 and has since taken carriage of the families' fight for justice.

Leonie Duroux told the MailOnline the families of the murder victims and the wider indigenous community were grateful this latest inquiry might give them another opportunity for the cases to be investigated and tried.

'We hope something comes of it,' she said. 'it was because of these cases that the laws were changed surrounding double jeopardy [in which a person cannot be tried a second time after being acquitted once on the same charge],' Ms Duroux said

'The law now says a case can be retried if the evidence is fresh and compelling. We hope they will listen and and decide something has to be done.

'It has been a very long time and the murders still affect people's lives.'

Jay Thomas Hart's mother. Marlene Hart, told the MailOnline her son was an innocent man who had been unfairly targeted for almost a quarter of a century.

'It's been absolute terror,' said Mrs Hart, who still lives in Bowraville.

'It's affected our whole family and my health, but [the police] stop at him and don't go any further.'
