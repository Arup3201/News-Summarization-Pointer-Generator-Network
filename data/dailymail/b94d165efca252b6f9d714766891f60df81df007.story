A car arrived bearing a floral 
tribute to the 29-year-old spelling out her name in pink, while Gia's 
coffin was driven to the venue in a white hearse.

Gia's Bachelor co-star Jake Pavelka is also believed to have been in attendance. He earlier tweeted: 'Going 2 b an incredibly tough day. Crossfit train n NY 2 occupy my mind. Then...Find my peace w Gia. Can I ask 4 ur prayers today?'

The model and actress shot to fame as a contestant on the tenth season of popular reality show The Bachelor where she became the third last contestant to be sent home by Pavelka.

Gia, committed suicide at her home in New Orleans, Louisiana and was found by her long term boyfriend, New Orleans Pelicans star Ryan, on Monday August 12.

She was rushed to University Hospital in New Orleans and placed on life support before passing away two days later.

Gia's tragic death has left friends and family desperately searching for answers.

She is reported to have been going through problems in her relationship with NBA star Ryan. - a source told People they were not living together and cited Gia's religious beliefs as the  reason 'they were waiting for marriage to consummate their relationship'.

Gia had also been 'hoping for a ring' from Ryan, according to another friend who saw the star weeks before her death. 'But their problems really seemed like typical relationship issues everyone has,' they added.

Unsure of where her relationship was heading, Gia was even considering a move back to New York.

'You could tell she was sad about things weren't working out the way she hoped they would,' Bachelor Pad co-star Michelle Money told People.

TMZ has also previously reported that Gia accused Ryan of being unfaithful during a lunch date the day she died.

During the car ride back to her New Orleans home, he told Gia: 'I don't love you anymore,' TMZ claim.

Despite her insecurities, friends and
family of the star all reiterate that Gia 'didn't seem the type' to 
take her own life and had been 'behaving normally' in the days before 
her death.

In fact, law enforcement officers told People that the suicide did not appear premeditated, with her 
apartment well maintained, her refrigerator stocked and new clothes 
found in her bedroom.

However, around
an hour before her fatal act, the star allegedly sent an email to Ryan 
detailing their problems before emailing friends and family in a way 
'consistent with someone saying goodbye,' according to a responding 
officer.

Previous reports have suggested that Gia was on the telephone to her mother when she hanged herself.

According to TMZ, Donna Micheletti told police that during the call, the phone 'had gone silent'.

Ms Micheletti then tried 'in vain' to communicate with her daughter for a further ten minutes.

Her boyfriend then returned home to check on Gia, but when he found her body, made a 911 call.

But by the time Ryan discovered his girlfriend's body, 'she had been without oxygen for around 30 to 40 minutes.'

One of Gia's neighbours, Mike 
Simpson, told People that he ran to the scene after overhearing Ryan's 
horrified reaction and took over speaking to the 911 operator while the NBA star performed CPR.

'He just kept yelling her name like "Why, Gia? Why?" Simpson recalled. 'He was so distraught.'

Gia allegedly left a suicide note on the dining room table, leaving all of her property to her mother.

In a statement released after her death, Ryan said: 'Gia was the most beautiful person I knew inside and out, and she always smiled and made everyone else around her smile.  She had such an amazing impact on my life and anyone that knew her was blessed.'

Ms Micheletti also posted an online tribute video and obituary for her daughter on the Papavero Funeral Home site.

'Loving girlfriend 'Petrie' of Ryan 'Snuggy' Anderson, beloved daughter and little princess of Donna Micheletti and stepdaughter of Tony Micheletti, loving sister of Dylan and Erick, most cherished granddaughter of Marie (Nonna) Coltrinari, devoted Godchild of Fred and Annemarie Coltrinari, dear cousin of Brian, Ellen, Kevin and Julie, and also survived by her dear dog Bentley,' the obituary read.
