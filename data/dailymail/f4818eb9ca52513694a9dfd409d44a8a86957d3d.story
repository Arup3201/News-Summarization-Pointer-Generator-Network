Distinguished judge: Baroness Butler-Sloss has warned of the peril of legalising assisted suicide

One of the country’s most distinguished judges has warned of the peril of legalising assisted suicide.

Allowing the terminally ill to be killed would cross ‘a line in the sand’ towards euthanasia, according to Baroness Butler-Sloss.

‘The law rests on the principle that we do not involve ourselves in deliberately bringing about the deaths of others,’ she said yesterday.

‘Once we start making exceptions based on arbitrary criteria like terminal illness, that frontier becomes just a line in the sand, easily crossed and hard to defend.’

Lady Butler-Sloss, an appeal judge who headed the family court system until her retirement, intervened in the euthanasia argument on the eve of a landmark Supreme Court case.

Nine judges will sit in a test case, which decides whether the assisted suicide law should be changed.

The Supreme Court hearing, which will consider appeals on behalf of two men who want doctors to be able to help them die, coincides with a new attempt by right-to-die campaigner Lord Falconer to persuade peers to vote for a law to allow doctors to help terminally ill patients to die.

Lady Butler-Sloss, 80, said: ‘We are seeing a predictable upsurge in the activities of the assisted dying lobby in the run-up to the Supreme Court’s hearing next week.

‘Assisting suicide is against the criminal law, and with good reason. The prohibition is there to protect vulnerable people. Yet some are suggesting that this process should be put into reverse for terminally ill people and that doctors should be licensed to facilitate their suicide.’

Lady Butler-Sloss, who is the former 
president of the Family Division, accused right-to-die campaigners of 
bending debate on the issue by twisting the language.

‘Campaigners
throw up their hands at the word suicide,’ she said. ‘Giving lethal 
drugs to someone who is terminally ill isn’t assisting suicide, they 
say, but assisting dying.

‘Similarly,
Lord Falconer’s Private Member’s Bill, now before the House of Lords, 
describes the lethal drugs that it wants doctors to be able to supply to
terminally ill patients as “medicines”. Such euphemisms may make the 
idea of changing the law more palatable, but they obstruct reasoned 
debate.’

She said an 
assisted suicide licensing system with ‘doubtful safeguards’ would suit a
few people determined to end their own lives.

However, she added: ‘Parliament has to make laws to protect all of us, especially the most vulnerable.

‘It is hard to imagine any group of people more vulnerable than those who are dying. They need our support and protection, not our help to commit suicide.’

'Assisting suicide is against the criminal law, and with good reason. The prohibition is there to protect vulnerable people'

Once assisted suicide was legalised, she said, the practice would spread beyond the set limits.

‘Anyone who doubts this should read the report of Lord Falconer’s self-styled “commission on assisted dying”, and its conclusion that legalising assisted suicide for people with severe physical impairments was not acceptable “at this point in time”,’ Lady Butler-Sloss wrote in the Sunday Telegraph.

Under the 1961 Suicide Act, anyone who helps a suicide is guilty of a crime that carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in jail.

The Supreme Court will hear appeals on behalf of Tony Nicklinson and Paul Lamb. Mr Nicklinson, who had locked-in syndrome following a stroke, died in August 2012 after losing his High Court case for the right to be helped to die. His widow Jane has been allowed to pursue the case.

Mr Lamb, a former builder and a father-of-two, has been almost totally paralysed since a car crash in 1990. He wants a doctor to be allowed to help him die.
