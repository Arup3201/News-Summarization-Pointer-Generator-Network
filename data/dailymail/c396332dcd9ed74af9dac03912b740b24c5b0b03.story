Jokes and stories: Marlene Watson, of Wall Heath, West Midlands, is an international star on Facebook

Videos of a great-grandmother telling jokes and stories in a broad Black Country dialect have turned her into an international star.

Marlene Watson, of Wall Heath, West Midlands, has posted the videos on Facebook under the name ‘Marlene, a Black Country Wench’ - and they have been viewed around the world.

The clips have been watched almost 80,000 times, with viewers from the likes of Canada, the US and New Zealand - and Mrs Watson also writes stories about her day in the local dialect. 

The 68-year-old, whose most watched-video has been viewed 42,000 times, said: ‘I am just so proud of the Black Country and the accent.

'I was born and bred in Quarry Bank. I just feel the real Black Country dialect is dying out and I want to keep the accent alive.

‘I wanted to make a video speaking in the Black Country dialect and post it online - with the help of my daughter Vanessa to see the response.

‘But I have been taken aback by the reaction and how people have taken it to their hearts. 

'There is so much demand that, as soon as I have posted one online, people have been asking when the next one will be posted.’

Mrs Watson, who lives in a £130,000 three-bedroom house and is married to Mark, 71, makes the videos in her conservatory and tells jokes and witty stories about life growing up.

She has three children, five grandchildren and one great-grandaughter. Her grandmother May Elizabeth Brettle, who worked on markets across the Dudley area, is a focus of many stories.

She said: ‘There is always something going on in the background, like my son trying to put me off. I think people like it because it is natural.

‘Dokter, Dokter, them pills yow gid me ter mek me strunger, well they ay a werkin’

‘How can you tell?’

‘I cort get the top off the bockle!’

'O.k dow wurry doc, I ull cum bak wen yow'm sober!'

‘For people who have moved away from the area, it reminds them of where they come from and brings back many happy memories.

‘My nan was a Black Black Country wench. She was a very strong woman who ruled us like a rod of iron. She had a big effect on me growing up and she still influences me now.’

Katie Henn, of  Halesowen, commented on one video to say: ‘Just had a tear watching this.

‘Lost my nanna/mom this year and she was just like this. I owe my life to that woman and the peppermints in hot water, Indian brandy and hot blackurant. Mwah x x x.’

And Melissa Moody said: ‘This is brilliant , well done Marlene, just watching this has made me feel like I've been on a little nostalgia trip, back to when my grandparents were alive and lived in the butchers shop at Quinton!’

Meanwhile, Wayne Wagner Bucknall added: ‘I live in Chicago now an hearing that as med mar day - keep em coming, nothing like Black Country humour. God bless from good old USA.’

The Daily Mail reported last year how children at a West Midlands primary school had been told to speak proper English instead of the Black Country dialect to halt a ‘decline in standards’.

Those who said they ‘cor do that’ - ‘can’t do that’ - were not punished at Colley Lane Primary School in Halesowen, but corrected every time they utter an outlawed phrase.

Foreign hospital nurses are so baffled by their patients' broad Black Country dialect that they have been offered free lessons in words and phrases, it was revealed today.

Some 59 new nurses have been recruited from parts of Europe to cope with a staffing shortage. More overseas nurses are coming in the New Year.

So classes are being set up to help nurses get to grips with the area's distinctive speaking style.

Lessons: One of the new recruits at New Cross Hospital (pictured) in Wolverhampton said she struggled at first to understand patients, but was gradually getting used to it

They are being taught phrases like ‘cake hole’ (mouth); ‘cat-lick’ (quick wash) and ‘ta-ra a bit’ (goodbye) to help them understand patients' slang.

One of the new recruits at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton is Afrodite Karga, who comes from Greece. She said she struggled at first to understand patients, but was gradually getting used to it.

Ms Karga said: ‘I went to my ward for the first day in my job and I could not understand many things because the accent was very weird for me. But now I can understand a lot of things. I think I can understand them totally.’

The hospital's head of nursing education, Lorna Southan, said new nurses were settling in well, adding: ‘Patient feedback has been very positive.’

A hospital official, who  remained anonymous, said: ‘I should imagine there is a similar problem with foreign nurses in other parts of the country as well, such as Somerset, Liverpool and Newcastle.’
