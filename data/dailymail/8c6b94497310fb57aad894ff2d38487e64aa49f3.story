Tony Fernandes is here at Loftus Road to talk football. QPR have a new manager in Chris Ramsey, they are in a battle against the drop and he is keen to impress how the club have changed and how they can withstand the shock of relegation should that day come.

But it is hard to focus entirely on matters on the pitch. For Fernandes is also the face of AirAsia and describes the last seven weeks as the ‘worst 50 days of my life’.

It was on December 28 that AirAsia flight QZ8501 with 162 people on board crashed into the sea between Surabaya and Singapore.

‘I think the only way I do know how to manage these things is with my heart,’ says Fernandes, owner and chief executive of AirAsia. ‘Just confront it and deal with it. It has just been a nightmare to be honest. The only way I know how to deal with it is to deal with it.

‘I get text messages every day from the families. They all have my mobile phone number. I’ve been going to funerals and that’s hard. But the families have been amazing to us. They’ve given me strength.’

Fernandes dealt with the tragedy by flying immediately to Indonesia to assist with the search for the plane and, ultimately, the bodies. There he was confronted by the victims’ families. ‘That was really hard. What do you say to someone who has lost five people on their plane? I don’t know. Human nature, whatever, gives you the strength to find a way. Burying my own staff was a nightmare. Taking a 22-year-old girl on a plane and burying her in her home town. But you find the strength.

‘I apologised. It’s not our fault. We don’t know. But what else can you say? They were on my aircraft. And they’re not with them. And we just sat and talked and made them feel very comfortable that whatever happens, we would find them and we wouldn’t give up. And I think that was very reassuring. We haven’t found everyone yet. There are still more than 50 people unaccounted for. But we just talked to them and let them talk to me, show me pictures and tell stories.’

In such circumstances it would be inhuman to worry about football and what was going on at QPR, and the club necessarily was not his first priority. ‘I remember turning on to watch the Sheffield United game [in the FA Cup] — and turning it off pretty quickly. No, it wasn’t top of my list. I remember there was a draw with Crystal Palace. I still wanted QPR to win. I still had one eye on looking at Twitter and hoping to see a goal.

‘Your life becomes split in two: you have to deal with the pain but you also have to make sure you deal with the people who are still alive and provide their livelihoods and QPR is one of those.’

Almost two months on, his energies are still clearly focused on the crash investigation but he is now as committed to QPR as ever in what has been a difficult period. He insists he was surprised as anyone that Harry Redknapp resigned three weeks ago after a quiet transfer window. ‘No one believes me but I never expected Harry to want to resign,’ he says.

However, the ‘boring’ transfer window does mean QPR are now shedding their image as a soft touch. Fernandes knows what agents in the game think: that QPR is the place you go in order to offload older and expensive players. ‘Or players looking for a massive pay-out,’ he says. ‘I hate it. I hate it. That’s all gone and players know now. We’re going to have a great wage bill next year. A fair one.’

He cites the debut of midfielder Michael Doughty, 22, a QPR trainee, in the 2-0 win at Sunderland as the model the club will now aim for, with Les Ferdinand appointed director of football. 

‘There were certain managers who wanted to go for more experience than youth,’ says Fernandes. ‘What do you do? You keep pushing the manager, saying: “Try this, try this, try this”. And he wants a different type of player. But at least this season everyone we bought [last summer] had some sell-on value and was young enough. We didn’t do Jermain Defoe. Emmanuel Adebayor was offered to us and we just didn’t do any of those. It never got past page one. We’ve created the right atmosphere now.’

For now, Ramsey will manage the team and, even if the club is relegated, he may keep the job. ‘I don’t think that makes a difference, I really don’t. It’s how he manages the next 15 games.’

Before promoting Ramsey from coach, Fernandes tweeted about having spoken to his ‘dream manager’. The smart money is that he meant Paul Clement, the Real Madrid coach, whose father once played at QPR. He fits the profile of what Fernandes wants: a coach who will promote young players. Fernandes will not confirm that but admits that Clement and Brentford manager Mark Warburton have been considered.

‘Some of those names are definitely names we considered. I know Paul Clement. He’s a great guy and I’ve spoken to him many times. Mark Warburton has done a great job at Brentford — so you have to consider someone like that. Michael Laudrup was never in the picture. My focus is just on Chris right now.’

Whatever happens, he claims to be confident the club are now under control. It has not always seemed that way. In 2012-13, the year they went down to the Championship, the club lost £65.3million. The club’s wage bill was £78.0m, more than its entire turnover of £60.6m. The accounts for 2013-14 are out next month and even if they have improved — several expensive players were offloaded, though they had to absorb the pain of losing Premier League TV money — it seems difficult to see how they can avoid a huge fine under the Football League’s new Financial Fair Play rules if they go back down.

What complicates the matter is that the Football League have since changed their rules, making them more lenient, and Fernandes has sent a clear signal that he expects to be judged under the most-recent rules. ‘One of the great things is that a precedent has been set in that they’ve changed the rules already,’ he says. ‘That in itself is a great legal argument.’

And Fernandes says that the club can cope with relegation without huge amounts of fresh subsidies from himself and the Mittal family, which has kept the club afloat up to now. ‘That fear of getting relegated has gone now. If we get relegated, we get relegated and we build. Southampton were a League One side, right? Look at them now.’

Since he took over in 2011, almost every transfer window has felt like panic stations, planning for the worst-case scenario. ‘Well, this time we’ve said: “**** it”,’ he says. ‘We’re going to think for the long term. Because every six months we were fighting against relegation and I saw a window and would buy players. It has always been that.

‘Then you’re in the Championship and you’re fighting for promotion and it’s, “OK, we need some more players. It’s worth buying because we’ll get £60m when we’re back in the Premier League”.’

It has taken almost four years but it seems as though he may have finally got on top of football.
