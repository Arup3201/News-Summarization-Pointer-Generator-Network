Hungry albatross chicks are swallowing an array of plastic objects that slowly kill them, a biologist has warned.

While trying to catch a nutritious meal of fish eggs, squid or fish, the birds accidentally eat indigestible objects, such as toothbrushes and lighters.

Dutch biologist Jan Andries van Franeker has photographed the unusual items found in the carcasses of decayed chicks on Midway Atoll, the northernmost island of the Hawaii chain, to highlight the environmental problem.

Stomach-churning: A selection of indigestible items that have been swallowed by Albatrosses and plucked from the decaying carcasses of their chicks

Wandering albatross have the record for the bird with the largest wingspan at 3.5 metres.

Distances are hard to measure, but one banded bird was recorded travelling 6000 km in twelve days.

They spend most of their life on the wing, returning to land only to court a mate and to breed.

The female Albatross lays just one egg that can weigh 1.2lb  (0.5kg), in a basic nest on the ground.

The parents take it in turns to incubate the egg for 2-3 months depending on the size of the Albatross species.

Chicks can take anywhere from 5 to 10 months to fledge, depending on the size of the Albatross species.

Albatross are very long living Birds with an average age of between 40 and 50 years old.

The images show the items albatrosses are swallowing on a daily basis, including toothbrushes, golf balls and plastic action figures.

They eat the plastic objects, which are typically attached to fish eggs floating in the sea.

In the past, the eggs were attached to pieces of wood or seaweed, which the albatross would either digest of break into smaller bits.

They also eat items they think resemble 
natural prey such as a fish, squid or large crustaceans, which make up 
their normal diet.

Dr van Franeker, a biologist from Amsterdam, Netherlands, travelled to the North Pacific Ocean to monitor the albatrosses.

‘I went to Midway because I'm a long term investigator of the problems related to plastics in the sea and specifically the problem of ingestion by seabirds, the 59-year-old said.

Dr van Franeker explained that sharp and large items (such as the golf balls pictured) can make it difficult to regurgitate indigestible materials from the stomach of Albatrosses

Adults birds are 80cm long with a wing-span of two metres and weigh up to 4kg.

‘When I was there, I looked for this phenomenon, and had a closer look at the contents of dead animals,’ he said.

He explained that Laysan albatrosses are known for their extreme ingestion of plastics, which leads to chicks accumulating them in their stomachs.

‘These are big birds and there is definitely space for items the size of toothbrushes,’ Dr van Franeker said.

‘However, these large and sharp items can make it difficult to regurgitate indigestible materials from the stomach.

While most chicks regurgitate the 
indigestible material before fledging - growing feathers to fly - Dr van
 Franeker explained: ‘if the plastic inside is too large, it will stay 
and slowly kill the chick.

‘When I found these items I felt it was a disgrace to humanity that we should rapidly end,’ he added.
