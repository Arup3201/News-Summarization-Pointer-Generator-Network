Scotland manager Gordon Strachan knows he has some big decisions to make over the coming hours as he picks his side to face England at Celtic Park.

Strachan's side come into the game following a morale-boosting 1-0 Euro 2016 qualifying win over the Republic of Ireland and although there will be no points to play for in Glasgow, there is plenty of pride at stake.

'We did an intensive warm-up and I thought, "this is as intense as the first day of pre-season",' the boss said in his pre-match press conference.

'So many players want to play on Tuesday night. There's one or two lumps, but it hasn't affected anyone, it was kind of rub it and get on with it.

'I would love to give everybody the experience of playing in the game one way or another. I want to win the game as well, we have had to try and balance that and that is what we will think about in the next couple of hours.

'Everybody who is playing are competitors, everyone wants to compete and make it as difficult for the other team to win as possible, it will be the same on the other side.

'It will be intense on Tuesday, their players will enjoy the atmosphere.

'We had Sunday off, we put the lads through an intensive warm-up today and thought they might take it a bit easier when we put on a match situation.

'But it was like the first day of pre-season. We've got so many players who want to play. There were a few bumps, but it was the old-school "just rub it down and get on with it".'

'It was physical, but fair. I've seen people saying it was some kind of bloodbath, but it was nothing like that. It was toe-to-toe, played in the right manner and there were bumps and bruises.

'As long as they are fair challenges, you have to deal with that. The Ireland game was played in a terrific spirit and I hope and know it will be the same tomorrow.

'Most of the England players will be looking forward to this game. They know it will be a competitive atmosphere and great players will enjoy that.'

Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher missed Scotland's final training session and Strachan has a doubt over the fitness over goalkeeper David Marshall.
