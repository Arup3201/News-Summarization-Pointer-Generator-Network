UN General Secretary Ban Ki-Moon has spoken of the 'shame' that fell on his organisation for failing to act against the Rwandan genocide as the African nation marks the 20th anniversary of the tragedy.

Over the course of 100 days, starting on April 6, 1994, nearly 800,000 ethnic Tutsis were killed by Hutu extremists as they tried to eradicate the minority group.

The international community, including the UN, were accused of deliberately ignoring events and of failing to intervene, despite warnings from peacekeepers within the country that genocide was taking place.

UN general Secretary Ban Ki-Moon, who was in Rwanda today to take part in ceremonies commemorating the 20th anniversary of the country's genocide, as spoken of the UN's 'shame' over failing to act

Ceremonies in the capital Kigali were led by President Paul Kagame, who came to power as the genocide ended

Speaking at events in the capital Kigali, Ban said: 'Many United Nations personnel and others showed remarkable bravery.

The
 Rwandan genocide started on April 6, 1994, when President Habarimana's 
plane was shot down over the capital Kigali.

His death brought years of ethnic tensions to the surface, with extremist Hutus starting a planned campaign of extermination against the minority Tutsis.

Over the next 100 days 800,000 Tutsis were killed, alongside thousands of Hutu moderates who objected.

The killings only stopped when the Tutsi-controlled Rwandan Patriotic Front seized control, and put Paul Kagame into power.

The international community, and the UN, were criticised for failing to act, despite warnings from inside the country that genocide was taking place.

'But we could have done much more. We should have done much more. In Rwanda, troops were withdrawn when they were most needed.'

'One year later in Srebrenica, areas proclaimed 'safe' by the United Nations were filled with danger, and innocents were abandoned to slaughter. The shame still clings, a generation after the events.'

He added that the genocide was 'one of the darkest chapters in human history'.

Official mourning began three months ago with a flame of remembrance touring towns and villages across the small nation, and culminated on Monday when the torch arrived at the national genocide memorial - where the remains of a quarter of a million people are stored in vast concrete tombs.

President Paul Kagame lit a flame that will burn for 100 days, the length of time it took soldiers and militiamen to carry out their plan to wipe out the 'Inyenzi' - a term meaning 'cockroaches' - that was used by extremists to designate minority Tutsis and Hutu moderates.

The slaughter only stopped after the Tutsi-controlled RPF seized power, installing Kagame as leader.

At the national stadium, survivors of the genocide recounted their memories of the killings and of survival.

Several people were overcome with trauma, screaming and crying uncontrollably with medical staff helping to carry them out and to provide counselling.

Performers re-enacted events from the massacre which saw 800,000 minority Tutsis - three quarters of the population - killed in just 100 days starting on April 6, 1994

As the ceremonies took place, there were cries and screams from the audience and several had to be treated by medics as painful memories flooded back

'It is the day when the faces of all those I loved and died come back,' said Marie Muresyankwano, a mother in her thirties, saying that she would spend time 'with my own thoughts'.

'It is so hard for the people, because it opens mental wounds, hearing the testimonies of those who survived, they are reminded of what happened to them,' a Rwandan health ministry official said.

The commemorations were also attended by former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, who advises President Kagame through his Africa Governance Initiative foundation.

French officials, however, were absent, with French Justice Minister Christiane Taubira having pulled out over the weekend after Kagame repeated his accusation of French 'participation' in the genocide.

Kagame said in an interview that French soldiers - who helped train the Hutu-controlled Rwandan army prior to 1994, as well as being accused of aiding the killers to escape - were both accomplices and 'actors' in the bloodbath.

France's ambassador to Kigali, Michel Flesch, said that he had been telephoned overnight and told he was no longer welcome at the ceremonies.

French authorities have repeatedly denied any direct involvement in the genocide, and, unlike former colonial power Belgium, have refused to apologise.

In his speech at the stadium, Kagame took another thinly-veiled swipe at France, saying it was impossible to 'change the facts', and drawing loud applause.

Kagame is a controversial figure. He has helped Rwanda to become one of the most economically stable countries in Africa, but is also accused of human rights violations

During the genocide 800,000 Tutsis were killed by extremist Hutus over the course of 100 days. The killing only stopped after the RPF seized power and installed Kagame as leader

But he said Rwandans should also celebrate the remarkable progress made in the past 20 years.

Kagame has led Rwanda since his then-rebel force ousted Hutu extremists, steering a business-friendly and zero-corruption policy - although he has also come in for fierce criticism over his refusal to tolerate dissent and his alleged backing of rebels in neighbouring DR Congo.

'Today we have a reason to celebrate the normal moments of life, that are easy for others to take for granted. If the genocide reveals humanity's shocking capacity for human cruelty, Rwanda's choices show its capacity for renewal,' Kagame said.

Tony Blair attended the commemoration ceremonies in the Rwandan capital of Kigali today, and was pictured paying his respects to the 800,000 killed.

The former PM has close ties to Rwanda and its President, Paul Kagame, through his Africa Governance Initiative foundation, which provides advice to African leaders.

Writing in today's Guardian, Blair has defended Kagame's time in power, saying he brought the small nation back from the brink in the wake of the atrocities committed in the mid-1990s.

Rwanda, he points out, is growing economically, is attracting foreign investment and provides a good level of healthcare to its citizens.

Elsewhere Rwanda's government has been described as the least corrupt in Africa by Berlin-based Transparency International.

However, Kagame, who was installed in power after the Tutsi controlled RPF seized control of the country following the genocide, is a highly controversial figure.

While his economic policies may be producing results, his human rights record has drawn strong criticism.

When Hutu extremists fled Rwanda to the neighbouring Democratic republic of Congo, or Zaire as it was then known, RPF soldiers pursued them, starting a chain of attacks and counter-attacks that have left millions dead.

Twice Rwanda has invaded the country outright, in September 1996 and again beginning in August 1998.

Kagame's supporters have also been implicated in attacks on opposition politicians and journalists.

In the run-up to the last election in 2010, which Kagame won, Amnesty International condemned the widespread violence across the country, during which one political leader was beheaded.

In 2001 Pasteur Bizimungu, a Hutu, tried to organise a political party to run against Kagame, but it was declared radical and Bizimungu was sentenced to 15 years in jail, though he was pardoned in 2007.

The same happened again in 2010 when Victoire Ingabire, a female politician, returned from 16 years in exile to run for president.

After a speech at the national genocide memorial, in which she was critical of the fact that no Hutu victims were remembered there, she was accused of 'genocide ideology' and arrested. During her trial, Kagame publicly declared her guilty.
