Searched: Tim Lambrinos, pictured, had his home in the northwest of the city searched by police on April 24, 2013

A well-known Toronto City Hall lobbyist had his home raided in connection with the same police probe into embattled Mayor Rob Ford which resulted in the seizure of the now infamous video of him smoking crack cocaine.

According to newly-released court documents Tim Lambrinos, former executive assistant to Councillor Giorgio Mammoliti who also lobbied local government on behalf of several exotic dance firms, had his home in the northwest of the city searched by police on April 24, 2013.

But Lambrinos on Friday told the Toronto Star that the raid was simply a case of surveillance gone wrong

'It's still a mystery,' said Lambrinos.

He said officers used a battering ram to smash through his front door and aimed guns at him and his brother, Chris, while they were watching TV.

'They were there for two-and-a-half hours, came out, apologized,' said Lambrinos.

'In the end they didn't take anything.'

He claimed that when he asked the police officers to show a warrant, the officers refused, according to the Star.

The search warrant documents, released on Friday, detail police surveillance leading them to the area of Lambrinos’ home.

The police monitored a red car they allege had picked up firearms in Windsor, a town to the south west of Toronto near the US border at Detroit.

The vehicle had parked across the street from Lambrinos’ home.

The document states that officers did not witness the occupants leaving the vehicle.

Details of the raid emerged in amongst a series of documents related to search warrants executed as part of Project Traveller, a guns and gangs investigation that netted the infamous video of Ford.

More than 50 people were arrested in several raids who now face charges of smuggling guns and drugs, and being a part of the Dixon City Bloods gang.
