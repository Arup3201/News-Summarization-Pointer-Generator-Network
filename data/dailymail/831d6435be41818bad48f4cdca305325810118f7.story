Ukip leader Nigel Farage has revealed his 'big regret' in life was spending too much time on politics – and not being able to see his daughters grow up.

Mr Farage makes the admission in an booze-fuelled interview with Gogglebox 'posh couple' Steph and Dom Parker.

The controversial politician is set to appear in a special Channel 4 spin-off from the popular show tonight – where he is interviewed at home with Mr and Mrs Parker.

Over several pints of beer, glasses of champagne and port Mr Farage disclosed he had not spent enough time with his youngest children

Over several pints of beer, glasses of champagne, red wine, port, and alcohol-laced coffee, Mr Farage disclosed he had not spent enough time with his youngest children.

He also admitted that he would never be Prime Minister – and did not want to be either. The Ukip leader said he prefered to 'do something' rather than 'be something'.

Mr Farage has two sons in their 20s from his first marriage and two younger daughters from his second.

He also claimed that he was 'poor' – despite earning around £80,000 a year. But he said this was 'about half of what the local headmaster or GP earns'.

But when asked about his children, he admitted: 'I've got regrets about that. Big regrets.

'My first marriage - I got divorced in the 90s - I spent loads of time with my kids, the boys, as they were growing up.

'I worked in the City so 5, 6 o'clock on Friday it was over, didn't start again until Monday morning.

'So I had time for the kids as they were growing up, the boys. And I guess my daughters have seen less of me than they probably should have done.'

Mr Farage, the Ukip leader, also admitted that he would never be Prime Minister – and did not want to be either

Nigel Farage insisted he had no regrets about going into politics - but claimed it had left him 'poor'.

The Ukip leader said he earned 'about half of what the local headmaster or GP earns'.

But Mr Farage and his wife Kirsten enjoy a lifestyle far beyond the reach of ordinary voters.

The couple live in a home worth around £540,000 and have annual earnings of more than £100,000, including:

When asked if he would ever be Prime Minister, he told them: 'I doubt it'.

The Gogglebox pair pressed him if he wanted to be the PM. He replied: 'Not really. There are two types of people in politics: those who want to be something and those who want to do something. I want to do something. Changing things in the country and changing the debate really interests me.'

The programme, At Home with Dom and Steph, is based in Mr and Mrs Parker's bed and breakfast in Kent.

The posh B&B sits in the constituency of South Thanet where Mr Farage will be standing in his bid to become an MP in the 2015 General Election.

Over the course of the interview, Mr Farage joins the couple in their local pub before ending up wearing his host's trousers after spilling champagne down his after a 'rip roaring' evening.

On LBC Mr Farage insisted that he did not collapse because of booze.

He said: 'They wanted to get me to pose sitting on a concrete step with them having a glass of champagne which I did.

'My body isn't particularly great at getting down and getting up again with all the back and neck problems I've got. So I got up and missed the top step with my...with a sort of toe.

'And the glass of champagne came out of my hand. And my very light grey trousers were covered in champagne.

'So you know I've no doubt that one or two newspapers before this is broadcast next will say that I collapsed. But nothing could be further from the truth.'

He added: 'We had a couple of pints and a few glasses of wine. It wasn't even...it wasn't silly I promise you.'

Steph and Dom Meet Nigel Farage is on Channel 4, Monday December 15, at 10pm

Nigel Farage's Hamburg-born wife Kirsten keeps a very low profile and is rarely seen in public

In his early 20s Nigel Farage had the first of several brushes with death, when he was run over by a car in Orpington, Kent, after a night in the pub.

He sustained severe injuries and doctors feared he would lose a leg.

Mr Farage was treated by a nurse called Grainne Hayes - who became his first wife.

He had two sons with Ms Hayes, who are both now grown up.

After splitting with Ms Hayes he married German-born bond trader Kirsten Mehr in 1999.

Months after recovering from his road accident, Mr Farage was diagnosed with testicular cancer.

It is one of the great contradictions of the Ukip leader that while he rails against Europeans ‘coming over here’ and taking the jobs, homes and public services of Brits that he is married to a German who could move here under the rules which he wants to tear up.

He jokes that being married to a foreigner is proof that he loves Europe.

Hamburg-born Kirsten keeps a very low profile and is rarely seen in public. At Ukip conferences, she sits anonymously in the audience.

She and Mr Farage met in Frankfurt in 1996, while he was travelling on business - and still married to his first wife.

Of the moment he met Kirsten, he once said: ‘She was a stunning government bond broker whose brisk efficiency at first sight belied her ethereal appearance.

'She could have stepped into a pre-Raphaelite painting no questions asked.’

Later, he explained in typically flamboyant style: ‘My marriage, which had been on ice and torpid with its claws bound for so long we had both forgotten it was alive at all, finally expired.’

The couple divorced in 1997 and Mr Farage married Kirsten in 1999.

Kirsten, gave up her career in the City, where she worked as an interpreter for a German bank, to look after the children - she and Mr Farage have two - and take her husband’s correspondence.

She writes all his emails because he dislikes using computers and is paid a salary by the European Parliament of more than £27,000 and has amassed more than £200,000 since she began working for him.
