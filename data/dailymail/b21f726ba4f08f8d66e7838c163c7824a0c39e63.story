A South Carolina construction worker got more than he bargained for when he helped himself to a refill of his 89-cent drink at a Veterans Affairs hospital.

Christopher Lewis of North Charleston, refilled his drink Wednesday without payingÂ  in the cafeteria of a VA hospital and was hit with a $525 fine and the loss of his job.

A hospital spokesperson was quick to mention to WCSC that there are signs all over the dining area saying refills aren't free, but Lewis claims to have never noticed them.

Banned: Christopher Lewis was fined $525 and barred from returning to the hospital where he worked after failing to pay for the drink refill

Costly mistake: The ticket lists a $500 fine and a $25 processing fee

Lewis says he has refilled his drink before without paying and it wasn't an issue.

'As I was filling my cup up, I turned to walk off and a fella grabbed me by the arm and asked me was I going to pay for that, and I told him I wasn't aware that I had to pay for that,' he told the station.

He claims he tried to pay for the drink but was never given the opportunity.

'I never had an option to make right what I had done wrong,' said Lewis.

He instead was taken to a room where he was handed a criminal citation for shoplifting and told never to return.

'I'm done there': Lewis says he was told not to go back to where he works, effectively firing him from his job

He didn't pay: The ticket lists shoplifting as the offense

'I'm done there, at the VA hospital, I'm not allowed to go on the premises anymore,' he said. I asked him can I still work on the job site and just bring my lunch and not go to the cafeteria and he said he wanted me off the premises.'

The medical center said in a statement that the VA doesn't determine the amount of the fine, but that federal police are there to enforce the law.

'A Federal citation was issued for shoplifting in the VA cafeteria to an individual who stated to VA police he had not paid for refills of beverages on multiple occasions, even though signs are posted in the cafeteria informing patrons refills are not free,' said the statement.

'Shoplifting is a crime. The dollar amount of the ticket is not determined by VA as it is a Federal citation.'

The hospital also claims that Lewis was belligerent during his discussion with police, something he denies.

'I was respectful,' he said.

Lewis insists he is not a crook and plans to contest the fine in court.

'I want everybody to know that I made a simple mistake, that I'm not a thief, that I'm not dishonest,' Lewis argued. 'I'm trying to do the right thing.'
