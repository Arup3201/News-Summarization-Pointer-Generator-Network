Too young: Julianni Plascencia, 8, pictured here in his football uniform, has died after accidentally hanging himself from a doorknob

An 8-year-old boy from California has died after hanging himself from a doorknob while his mother was briefly out of the house.

Julianni Plascencia was discovered Saturday night lying unconscious on the floor of his parents’ bedroom in Stockton by his older brother.

A scarf was wrapped around the child’s neck on one end, with the other tied around the door handle.

Plascencia was rushed to a hospital, where he passed away from his injuries less than 12 hours later surrounded by his family.

Speaking to News10Net, Julianni's parents said the boy – described as sensitive and caring – had told his older brother he was going to hang himself.

Julianni's sibling assumed the grade-schooler did not mean it, but warned him not to joke like that again.

Minutes later, the boy's big brother realized he had not heard from the 8-year-old and decided to check up on him. He entered their parents' bedroom, only to discover the child asphyxiated on the floor.

Mr Plascencia believes that Julianni may have been reenacting something he had seen on TV or in the movies when he got startled or accidentally fell.

EMS workers who were called to the house in the 7700 block of Brentwood Drive at around 9.30pm were able to restart Julianni’s heart before he was airlifted to UC Davis Medical Center.

Despite doctors' efforts to save him, the little boy was pronounced dead just after 11am Sunday, with his father cradling him and holding his tiny hand.

‘[I] rubbed his head, kissed him, held his hand...And to be there for him at the, you know it was time for him to go to heaven,’ Ronnie Plascencia said. 

Stockton police believe Julianni’s death was the result of a tragic accident. 

Shfawn Plascencia, Julianni’s mother, is 
still struggling to come to terms with what happened to her son – a 
football player who loved church and always encourage his family 
to give money to the homeless.

Promising athlete: The 8-year-old was a member of the North Stockton Bengals youth football league, which he joined only last year

‘Let him be happy in heaven. Because I know that's where he went. His heart was too big for this world,’ Mrs Plascencia tearfully said.

The boy's family have launched a fundraising page on GiveForward.com to collect donations towards his final expenses. So far, they have raised just over $1,000 – about 25 per cent of their $4,000 goal.

On Friday, The North Stockton Bengals youth football league, which Julianni had joined only last year, will host a spaghetti dinner at Bear Creek High School to help the Plascencia family.
