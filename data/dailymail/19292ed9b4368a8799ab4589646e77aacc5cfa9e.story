A Detroit teenager was charged with assault and a hate crime today over the brutal mob beating of a driver who stopped to help a boy he had accidentally hit with his pickup truck.

The 16-year-old boy, who has not been named, is the only one of five people charged in the April 2 attack on Steve Utash to face an ethnic intimidation count.

Mr Utash, a 54-year-old grandfather is white, and the teenager and four adults charged in his beating are black.

'In the case of the 16-year-old charged 
as a juvenile we can prove beyond a reasonable doubt the crimes of 
assault with intent to do great bodily harm and ethnic intimidation,' Kym Worthy, Wayne County's prosecutor, said.

'In the case of the four 
adult defendants that have been charged, the facts and the evidence does 
not support a charge of ethnic intimidation.'

Black leaders, Detroit's mayor and others across the city have spoken out against the attack.

A prayer vigil and Night of Healing program is scheduled for 7pm today at Historic Little Rock Baptist Church in Detroit.

'We need to send a crystal clear statement to the world that the violent actions of a few individuals will not cast a cloud of negativity over our city,' the Rev Jim Holley, the church's pastor, said.

'We are inviting everyone to participate to show support that this is a region of hope, peace and renewal.'

Hero: Deborah Hughes helped save Steve Utash's life when she stepped between him and his attackers

Mr Utash, a tree trimmer, suffered severe head injuries when at least six people beat and kicked him when he stopped his truck to help 10-year-old David Harris on Detroit's east side.

Deborah Hughes, a nurse who lives in the neighborhood, rushed to help the boy and stopped the mob from continuing to beat Mr Utash, police said.

He remains in hospital, where he was listed earlier this week as being in a critical condition and in a medically induced coma.

David Harris, the boy he ran into, was treated for a leg and other injuries. Police quickly ruled that it had been an accident.

'It was determined that the driver of the vehicle wouldn't have had any chance of stopping,' a Detroit police spokesman told Mail Online earlier this week.

A Go Fund Me page set up for Mr Utash, who has no health insurance, has already raised more than $155,000.

His family, who are keeping a bedside vigil, said on the site: 'Our dad is the same. We are still waiting to hear his voice.'

'Mr
 Utash did the right thing by stopping to help a child in need and, 
appallingly, was punished for doing so,' state representative Brian Banks said. 'People should not be punished for doing the right thing.'

Worthy said she 'would not be surprised' if police submitted more warrant requests stemming from the attack.

'This case is still under investigation,' she said. 'We are still looking at every avenue and every aspect. We know that there were a number of people involved in this case.'

On the mend: David Harris, 10, is expected to make a full recovery after being hit by Steve Utash's vehicle

The 16-year-old is in custody and faces a hearing Saturday in the county Juvenile Detention Center.

Latrez Cummings, 19, was charged Thursday with assault with intent to murder and assault with intent to do great bodily harm.

Bruce Wimbush Jr., 17; Wonzey Saffold, 30; and James Davis, 24, were arraigned this week on the same charges and are being held in the county jail on $500,000 bonds pending preliminary examinations on April 21.
