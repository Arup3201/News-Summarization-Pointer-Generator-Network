Premier League footballer Joey Barton has been bailed pending further inquiries by Merseyside Police after being arrested for affray earlier today.

The Queens Park Rangers midfielder, 29, was involved in trouble in the early hours of today while on a night out with his girlfriend in Liverpool city centre.

Barton, who has become well known for his opinionated Twitter outbursts, indicated tonight he was going on holiday tomorrow.

Fracas: A picture of the incident, apparently showing a shirtless Barton
being held back by police and a woman, believed to be his girlfriend, was circulated on Twitter

He tweeted: 'Looking forward to Portugal now tomo. Bit of rest and lots of golf...'

Earlier the Liverpool-born midfielder confirmed the incident by tweeting: 'I got sucker punched in the back of the head.'

Two men, aged 21 and from the Old 
Swan area of Liverpool, were arrested on suspicion of a public order 
offence at around 5.30am at the scene of the incident, outside Garlands 
nightclub in the city.

But after they were held in custody and questioned, Barton and a 20-year-old man were also arrested this afternoon.

All have been bailed pending further inquiries - with Barton the last of the quartet after he was questioned by officers.

A spokesman for Merseyside Police said: 'Following an altercation in 
Eberle Street, Liverpool city centre, in the early hours of this 
morning, four men have been arrested on suspicion of affray.

'Two 21-year-old men were arrested at the scene in the early hours of 
this morning and another two men, a 20-year-old from the Liverpool area 
and 29-year-old from the Widnes area, were arrested this afternoon.

'The two 21-year-old men and the 20-year-old man have been questioned by
officers and have been released on bail pending further inquiries.

'The 29-year-old man remains in police custody where he will be questioned by detectives.'

Delay: Joey Barton finally updated his Twitter account more than nine and a half hours after the incident

A picture of the incident was circulated
on Twitter later in the morning - but the footballer, whose own 
near-constant tweeting has been a frequent source of controversy, 
remained uncharacteristically silent until shortly after 3pm.

Barton finally broke his silence by 
telling almost 1.6million followers: 'I got sucker punched in the back 
of the head. Not injured as reported just a...Small bruise on rear of 
head/ear. I've had worse. Life goes on! Thanks for the concern. Have a 
good day people'.

The
footballer later added: 'Not planning on pressing charges as its (sic) 
not that serious. The police have also got better things to do with 
their time.

'Can I just say a public thanks to the police last night as they were and have been today brilliant.'

Until Barton mentioned the incident, all visitors to his Twitter page could see were
a series of boring comments about the Royal Family and the Queen's 
Golden Jubilee.

He tweeted: 'How have Prince Charles 
and Philip got that many medals? Can't remember reading about their 
heroism anywhere... #mystery'.

In
another post, he wrote: 'I don't mind The Queen. She seems alright. 
William seems sound as does Harry. The rest, well, they just annoy 
me...'

The 
photograph, taken outside a takeaway 25 metres from the club, apparently
shows a shirtless Barton being held back by police and a woman, 
believed to be his girlfriend Georgia McNeil.

Some celebrities took to Twitter to comment rather unkindly on the fracas.

Television host and former newspaper 
editor Piers Morgan was among the first of Barton's more than 1.5million
followers to reply to his comments, writing: 'If you need me to walk 
you home tonight, Pitbull @Joey7Barton - let me know.'

Barton replied: 'thanks mate. Ill give your good self a text next time. #tallyhosecurity'

Athlete Iwan Thomas wrote: 'BREAKING NEWS Joey Barton been attacked outside nightclub.... Police looking for 450,000 suspects'.

Circulated: The photograph of Barton was taken outside a takeaway 25 metres from the gay bar

It was alleged that the footballer had to be 'physically removed' from Garlands by security staff before he was punched outside.

Property entrepreneur Martin Makepeace, a friend of Garlands staff, wrote on Twitter: 'Just spoke to the lads at Garlands Liverpool who told me that Joseph Barton was physically removed from the club before the fracas outside.'

Nobody from the club was available to confirm the events leading up to the attack

A Merseyside Police spokeswoman said: 'Merseyside Police were called to Eberle Street in Liverpool city centre at 5.30am this morning following reports of an altercation.

'On arrival officers found a 29-year-old man who had sustained injuries to his face. The man left the scene voluntarily.

'Two 21-year-old men from the L13 area were arrested at the scene for a public order offence.

'They are currently in police custody.'

Ian Taylor, a spokesman for QPR, said: 'Joey Barton was involved in an incident in Liverpool city centre in the early hours of Monday morning.

'Barton was on his way home from a night out with his girlfriend when two men sang offensive chants and then proceeded to hit the R's midfielder.

'Police were immediately on the scene and arrested one man.

'Barton decided not to press charges and left the scene with his girlfriend soon after.

'The club will be making no further comment.'

News of the fight was widely commented on on Twitter, with the words Joey Barton and Garlands trending on the social media site.

Tweeter @JoshGore-11, who claimed to have been at the scene, said Barton had 'looked in a bad way' after the fight.

The Liverpool-born footballer has a 
long history of controversy on and off the pitch and has become 
well-known for his opinionated tweets.

Barton has posted about football, philosophy, politics and art in an attempt to shrug off his bad-boy image.

His
tweets have ranged from quoting philosophers to insulting figures like 
Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer for the clothes he wears on screen.

But the player has courted controversy and was threatened with legal action after tweeting about John Terry’s racism case.

Barbed comments: Athlete Iwan Thomas joked that police were 'looking for 450,000 suspects' for the attack

It is the latest of a long list of incidents involving the midfielder who was banned for 12 matches by the Football Association following his red card on the final day of the season in QPR's match against Manchester City.

He was banned for the sending off and
then for kicking out at Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero and attempting 
to head-butt Aguero's team-mate, Vincent Kompany.

Barton
has never been far from trouble in his career and was jailed for six 
months in May 2008 after admitting common assault and affray following 
an incident in Liverpool city centre the December before.

He was also fined about £60,000 while at Manchester City after he stubbed a lit cigar into the eye of his young team-mate Jamie Tandy during the club's Christmas party.

Barton was suspended by City for after a training-ground altercation with team-mate Ousmane Dabo.

He was charged with violent conduct by FA and received a four-month suspended sentence at Manchester Crown court.

An internet guide to Liverpool night life describes Garlands as a 'gay friendly super club'.

Trouble: Barton was given a 12-match ban after being sent off in the final match of the football season

'Garlands holds a mixture of gay and straight people who are all out for one thing - a funky night!,' states a review on the website anightinliverpool.com

'There are drag queens all around, usually ironing and hoovering with kids' toys, just funny and you're bound to have a smile on your face throughout the night.

'Drinks are quite expensive but the atmosphere is great and the music is a mix of house and dance tunes with some electro pumped in for good measure.

'It's a "Wear what you Dare" place, which gives it a feel good feeling because no one fits in, you're just individual and accepted.'
