As Manchester United manager, he didn't always have much luck on the communication front.

But David Moyes seems determined to show he has nailed the  language barrier at his new place of employment - by reeling off the four most common words in Spanish.

Faced with a room of Spanish journalists during a press conference, the new Real Sociedad coach temporarily ditched his mother tongue and attempted to count to four in the local language.

In the toe-curling interview, he even appeared to  follow in the notorious footsteps of Steve McLaren and Joey Barton by answering the question with an ever-so-slight Spanish accent. 

David Moyes attempted to show he had slotted into Spanish life during his Real Sociedad press conference by reeling off the four most common words in the Spanish language

The Sociedad boss said, 'they (B team) have been training with me uno, dos, tres, cuatro times'

When asked about the B team's prospects, the 51-year-old Glaswegian told journalists that he had seen them train 'dos, tres, cuatro' times.

But he couldn't quite keep up the charade, adding in English: 'But I have not seem them play.'

The baffling interview comes after Moyes spent the first game of his new career in San Sebastian shouting 'Stefano' to his players - despite no-one in the squad bearing that name.

A video of the press conference quickly spread online and the Scot was ridiculed for his bumbling efforts. 

Andy Jess wrote on Twitter: 'David Moyes trying to speak Spanish, it's like yer dad trying to order a meal on holiday... The waiter speaks better English than him.'

Sergi Dominguez posted: 'Here's David Moyes attempting to speak Spanish. Couldn't have asked for a better laugh.'

The baffling interview comes after Moyes spent his first game yelling out 'Stefano' to his players - despite no-one in the squad bearing that name 

While Chris Schilling wrote: 'David Moyes' Spanish lessons are going well, I see.' 

And Max Sjoblom wrote: 'David moyes speaking Spanish reminds me of every hotel in Ibiza I've ever stayed in full of jocks'.   

The video prompted comparison with the excruciating Steve McLaren interview, which was carried out with Dutch media when he became a club boss there in 2008. 

In a television interview which became a huge hit on YouTube, McClaren appeared to emulate the great Dutch coaches Marco van Basten and Guus Hiddink by trying to sound like them. 

There was speculation that McClaren was deliberately speaking with a Dutch accent as a private joke but reports at the time suggested it was no prank - and that was how he spoke English over there.  

QPR midfielder Joey Barton was also ridiculed for his French accent at Marseille after a hilarious press conference in which he acknowledged that he sounded like a cast member of 'Allo 'Allo.

In 2012, after making his debut for the club, Barton conducted his post-match press conference in English - but using a bizarre French accent 

After the interview, Barton tweeted: 'Steve MaClaren (sic) eat your heart out...'

He later added: 'In my defence, it is very difficult to do a press conference in Scouse for a room full of French journalists.

'The alternative is to speak like a 'Allo Allo!' character which is choose. Its simply a case of you had to be there. #youstupidwomen!'

He even came up with a novel name for the language, and said: 'I am christening this new language Bartonese.' 

Moyes was appointed at Real Sociedad last month following his disastrous 10-month spell at Old Trafford. He is one of just a few British managers who have tried their luck abroad.

The team drew Moyes's opening match, before winning 3-0 win  against Elche in the second game.

But he made an faux pas during his first game when the touchline camera revealed he was frantically shouting 'Stefano!' at one of his players - despite having 11 days to learn his players' names.

As Moyes talked about Real Sociedad afterwards, it was also noticeable that he slipped between 'they' and 'we'.
