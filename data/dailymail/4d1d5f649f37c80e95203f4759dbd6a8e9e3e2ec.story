He may run some of the world's leading technology companies such as SpaceX and Tesla Motors, but in recent months Elon Musk has become increasingly wary of the growth of technology.

In particular, he has repeatedly expressed his concern at the rise in artificial intelligence, and he thinks it could pose a serious threat to the future of humanity.

In his latest comment he fears that the risk of ‘something seriously dangerous happening’ could be in as few as five years.  

SpaceX and Tesla CEO has again warned of the dangers of AI robots. In a comment he said he feared something 'dangerous happening'. Musk (pictured) says the rise of AI will be exponential could spell disaster. He cites a London-based company called Deepmind as an example of how rapidly AI is improving

Although he doesn’t go into detail, he alludes to ‘digital superintelligences’ and internet bots as being among the potential problems facing humanity.

Musk made the comment on futurology site Edge, but deleted it soon after.

The reason for him deleting it is not known, although Business Insider suggests it may be because he feared being mocked for his ‘outlandish predictions’.

In the comment he says the pace of progress in AI is ‘incredibly fast’.

DeepMind Technologies is a British artificial intelligence company based in London.

It was acquired by Google for £400m ($625m) in January 2014.

The company says its exact goal is to ‘solve intelligence’, one of its recent achievements being the creation of a neural network that learns how to play video games.

The team is building algorithms that can learn in an attempt to create artificial intelligence.

Otherwise, though, the goals and methods of the company are not well-known - but it was apparently enough to convince Google to fork out a fairly sizable chunk of cash.

He continues: ‘Unless you have direct exposure to groups like Deepmind, you have no idea how fast - it is growing a pace close to exponential.’

He goes on to say that the risk of something dangerous happening is in the ‘five year timeframe’ or ten years at most.

But he adds that he is normally ‘super pro technology’ and has not raised this issue until recent months.

‘This is not a case of crying wolf about something I don’t understand,’ he writes.

‘I am not alone in thinking we should be worried.

‘The leading AI companies have taken great steps to ensure safety.

‘They recognise the danger, but believe that they can shape and control the digital superintelligences and prevent bad ones from escaping into the internet. That remains to be seen…’

Musk’s latest comments follow similar opinions posited by the entrepreneur in recent weeks.

In August in a tweet he said AI could be potentially more dangerous than nuclear weapons.

Then in early October Musk, talking at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit, said that AI could delete humans akin to ‘spam’ in an email inbox.

Later in October, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology AeroAstro Centennial Symposium he said: ‘I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it’s probably that. So we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence.’

He continued: 'I’m increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don’t do something very foolish. 

‘With artificial intelligence we’re summoning the demon. You know those stories where there’s the guy with the pentagram, and the holy water, and … he’s sure he can control the demon? Doesn’t work out.’

He is not alone in his viewpoint, though. Others, such as Stephen Hawkling, have also expressed concern at the rapid rise of AI.

‘Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history,’ Hawking said earlier this year in the Independent.

‘Unfortunately, it might also be the last.’
