The family of an American jihadist who went to Somalia to wage holy war have spoken of their heartbreak at his transition from gifted student to terrorist, declaring: 'We will love him until the day we die.'

Omar Hammami - a native of Alabama who is now on the FBI's most-wanted list - moved from Alabama to Somalia in 2006 where he joined al Qaeda-linked group al Shabab.

But fell out with the group last year and since then claims there have been numerous attempts made on his life, the most recent of which was last month when he was shot in the neck as he sat in a tea shop.

Now his family have told of their shock at how Hammami - who now answers to the name Abu Monsour Al-Amriki, or The American - went from gifted high school student to alleged mastermind of at least one deadly suicide bombing.

Attack: Omar Hammami, an American jihadi in Somalia, posted this picture of himself on Twitter showing injuries he said he sustained in an assassination attempt

Shafik and Debra Hammami first heard
 their son was a terrorist when they sawhim on an Islamic propaganda 
video broadcast on television.

'When
 I first saw the 
interview on TV, I knew that was the end of life as we knew it,' said 
Shafik from his home in Daphne, Alabama, his voice breaking with 
emotion. 'I knew 
we would never be the same again. It's devastating for both of us. He is
 our only son. We only have one son. And now, we have none.'

Describing Omar as a 'very sweet, intelligent child', he told CNN he
 excelled in the classroom and on the sports field, adding: 'I would 
have loved for him to be engineer or a doctor but that wasn't in the 
cards.'

He said Omar showed no signs of 
radicalization at the University of Alabama - even as president of the 
Muslim Student Association he was vocal in his condemnation of the 9/11 
attacks.

But he married a Somali woman and 
moved to Egypt to deepen his study of Islam. But a few years later, the 
family received a phone call from his wife saying he had gone to Somalia
 to visit her relatives but not returned.

The next time they heard of him he 
was decrying America and its corruption by sin on a jihadist video, 
flanked by masked Somali warlords.

The U.S. then named Hammami on its Most 
Wanted terrorist list in March and is offering a $5 million reward for 
information leading to his capture. Al Shabab fighters are not eligible 
for the reward.

'Of course I tried my best, and so 
did my wife, to raise him the best we could [but] he chose the path he 
did, and I do not approve of it,' added Shafik. 'But there is nothing I 
can do to change it.'

They say the stigma of having a 
terrorist convert for a son is an uncomfortable truth in a town of 
22,000 where Omar Hammami is known as 'that terrorist from here'.

Daphne, a Christian herself, said she
 has been abused in the street but remains strong through her faith in 
God and the support of 'wonderful friends'.

In
 a 127-page autobiography, posted online, Omar attempted to explain his 
relationship with the American dream: 'The real fear that the 
Americans feel when they see an American in Somalia talking about Jihad,
 is not how skillful he is at sneaking back across the borders with 
nuclear weapons.

'The Americans fear that their cultural barrier has been
 broken and now Jihad has become a normal career choice for any youthful
 American Muslim. Trying to show them how serious I am about 
slaughtering Disbelievers is the side of me they would like to 
capitalize on to estrange the Muslims from our cause.'

Hammami is now one of the two most notorious Americans in overseas jihadi 
groups after moving from Alabama to Somalia around 
2006.

There are scant details about what made Hammami go from being a gifted student, president of his Sophomore class who dated the most sought-after girl in school, to a key figure in one of the world's most ruthless Islamist insurgencies.

He was brought up as a southern Baptist who went to Bible camp and sang 'Away in a Manger' at Christmas time.

His mother was a typical Southern Belle with a distinct Alabama accent and taught at an elementary school.

His father came to America from Syria and became an engineer though was said to keep a strict household.

Hammami's upbringing was immersed in American culture yet still remained culturally Muslim, shoes were left at the door, Koranic inscriptions decorated the walls, pork was forbidden.

As a teenager, his passions fluctuated between Shakespeare and Kurt Cobain, soccer and Nintendo. He had dreams of being a surgeon.

Friends in his class said he was a natural leader and compared him to the main character in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

It was a trip to Damascus the summer before his sophomore year would make a lasting impression on him. When he came back, he said he was torn between Christianity and Islam.

He fought alongside the group for years while 
gaining fame for posting YouTube videos of jihadi rap songs in the hope of attracting young American Muslims.

But he fell out with al Shabab and has engaged in a public
 fight with the group over the last year.

Since then, Hammami has been a thorn in the group's side after accusing its leaders of living extravagant lifestyles with the taxes fighters
 collect from Somali residents.

Shafik,
 who calls Al 
Shabaab 'a bunch of thugs,' says Al Shabaab's top leadership who now want him dead because he 
disagrees with taking money from the poor to fund their lavish 
lifestyles and targeting civilians in suicide bombings.

'He is against those things,' said Shafik whose only way of staying in touch is by reading Omar's frequent Twitter posts.

Another Hammami grievance is that the 
Somali militant leaders sideline foreign militants inside al Shabab and 
are concerned only about fighting in Somalia, not globally.

But despite what he has done, Omar's family are still his family. 'Even if I can't see 
him, I just wish he stays safe,' says Shafik. 'And I wish... I wish he will know ... that I 
will love him until I die.'

Al Shabab have criticized Hammami publicly in a December Internet statement, 
saying his video releases are the result of personal grievances that 
stem from a 'narcissistic pursuit of fame'.

The statement said al Shabab
 was morally obligated to stamp out his 'obstinacy'.

The U.S. named Hammami on its Most 
Wanted terrorist list in March and is offering a $5 million reward for 
information leading to his capture. Al Shabab fighters are not eligible 
for the reward.

Along with Adam Gadahn in Pakistan - a former Osama bin Laden spokesman -
 Hammami is one of the two most notorious Americans in jihad groups.

Hammami has been releasing rap songs in English on the internet since 2009 even though music is forbidden in Al-Qaeda's strict interpretation of Islam.

Despite the threat against his life, Hammami said in an interview with Wired last month that he’s staying put and that he 'believes in attacking U.S. interests everywhere. No turning back.'

From an undisclosed location in Somalia, he said he grows vegetables, helps his wives around the house, and trolls his one-time colleagues in al Shebab on Twitter.

He also almost taunted his al Shabab enemies by boasting they could not come after him.

He told Wired that he believes his Twitter campaign has trolled Shebab so successfully that it’s insulated him from retaliation.

'They know that the first bullets are the nail in their coffin now that everything is in the open, shabab would lose aq [al-Qaida] support and support of soldiers and middle level.'
