Dave Lee Travis’s three-month suspended sentence for indecent assault was “neither wrong in principle nor unduly lenient” and will not be changed, the Attorney General has said. 

The disgraced DJ's was found guilty for molesting a researcher and was given a three month suspended sentence, which was referred to the Attorney General after it was criticised for being too lenient.

However Jeremy Wright QC, the Attorney General, decided that the 69-year-old’s sentence for groping a  22-year-old TV researcher on the Mrs Merton Show in 1995 would not be referred to the Court of Appeal.

The suspended sentence was considered for referral to the Court of Appeal after four members of the public contacted the Attorney General’s Office to complain that it was too soft.  

A spokesman for the Attorney General’s Office said: “The Attorney General, Jeremy Wright QC MP, has decided not to refer the suspended prison sentence given to David Griffin to the Court of Appeal as he does not believe they would find it to be unduly lenient and increase it.

“The judge marked the seriousness of the offence by imposing a three-month sentence of imprisonment, the maximum under the guidelines being six months.

“It was neither wrong in principle nor unduly lenient to suspend that sentence.”

Travis, whose real name is David Griffin, was found guilty at London’s Southwark Crown Court and sentenced by Judge Anthony Leonard last month.

During his trial the jury heard that the former Top Of The Pops presenter got a “weird sexual thrill” when he indecently assaulted the victim in 1995.  She is now a successful TV personality. 

The trial had heard he cornered her in the corridor of a BBC television studio where she was smoking.

He then commented on her “poor little lungs” before squeezing her breasts for 10 to 15 seconds.

Travis, who became a household name in the 1970s, was found not guilty on a second indecent assault charge and the jury was discharged after it was unable to agree a verdict on a count of sexual assault.

He faced a retrial after jurors failed to reach verdicts on those two charges earlier this year. He was cleared of 12 counts of indecent assault at his original trial in February.

The 69-year-old had accused the authorities of wasting ‘millions’ on the investigation into a string of allegations against him spanning several decades.

He said the single guilty verdict failed to prove he is a ‘sexual predator’ and has left him ‘mortified and disappointed’. 

Travis protested his innocence throughout the trial and tried to dismiss other women who claimed they had been groped by him as 'fantasists and liars'.

Travis, of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, was first arrested in October 2012 under Operation Yewtree. 

Yewtree was launched by Scotland Yard in the wake of allegations against the late DJ Jimmy Savile.
