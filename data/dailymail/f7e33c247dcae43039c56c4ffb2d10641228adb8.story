Brazil's 7-1 defeat by Germany is a result that shook the game. Not merely for the black and white statistics, not simply for the comprehensive difference of performance between the teams, but also for the context in which it arrived.

It may be the greatest surprise in history for a combination of reasons but it is not the first. We have had truly remarkable wins against the odds, thumping scorelines to astonish, and results difficult to comprehend.

Here, Sportsmail charts 10 of the best.

What
 is it about Belo Horizonte and humiliation? Sixty-four years before 
Brazil suffered in the city, England were humbled in the biggest upset the World Cup has seen. The United States had lost seven matches in a 
row with an aggregate goal difference of minus 43; England arrived as 
the ‘Kings of Football’ and huge favourites.

‘We have no chance,’ said 
US coach Bill Jeffrey. But the Americans – an assorted bunch of teachers
 and postmen – soaked up pressure and scored in the first-half through 
Joe Gaetjens, and then held on for the unlikeliest of wins.

Legend has it 
some newspapers were so confused by the scoreline coming from South 
America they thought it a typo and reported England had won 10-1.

The
 Brazil players from this match at the Maracana might at least get some 
respite now. For decades they have symbolised dramatic failure in the 
country which cradles the game like no other, wearing the result like 
an albatross around their necks.

They had been expected to easily dismiss 
Uruguay, a nation of 3 million, in the final match – a draw would have 
been enough to lift the trophy – and 200,000 fans crammed into the 
famous stadium in anticipation.

Friaca gave the hosts the lead but Juan 
Alberto Schiaffino equalised before Alcides Ghiggia hit the winner goal 
with 11 minutes left. The term Maracanazo, roughly translated as ‘The 
Maracana Blow’, was born.

This
 was the match that shattered English hubris and swept aside malaise. 
Billed as the ‘Match of the Century’, bringing the originators of the 
game versus the No 1 team in the world, England were supremely 
confident.

They had never lost at Wembley and players such as Ferenc Puskas
 were unknown on these shores. But the Hungarians’ innovative 2-3-3-2 
formation and fluid lines showed England’s WM system to be outdated, 
while fitness and coaching methods were also exposed.

Nandor Hidegkuti 
scored a hat-trick, Puskas got two and Jozsef Bozsik one as England were
 trounced. For the first time, English managers started to look to the 
continent for tactical and training advances.

Liverpool
 had won their 17th First Division title by nine points, losing only two
 matches, and had collected four European Cups in the previous 11 years. 
Wimbledon were a rag-tag group of players more famous for their ‘Crazy 
Gang’ moniker than trophies, never before lifting a major piece of 
silverware - indeed, they had only just completed their second ever season in the top flight.

But on a sunny afternoon at Wembley Bobby Gould’s team 
pulled off a stunning victory. Shortly before half-time, Lawrie 
Sanchez’s header from a Dennis Wise free kick looped over Bruce 
Grobbelaar and into the net.

Dave Beasant then became the first 
goalkeeper to save an FA Cup final penalty to deny John Aldridge and Wimbledon held on.

Barcelona
 were the team of Romario, Hristo Stoichkov, Ronald Koeman, Pep 
Guardiola and Miguel Angel Nadal. They were not short of talent, confidence or know-how, having won the European Cup two years 
earlier at Wembley. Johan Cruyff was their manager.

They had only 
conceded three goals in seven previous matches in the Champions League in 1993-94. But 
at the Olympic Stadium in Athens, Fabio Capello’s Milan produced a 
performance from the gods to lift the trophy in breathtaking style.

Daniele Massaro got two, Dejan Savicevic scored a beautiful lob, and 
Marcel Desailly added the exclamation mark to complete one of the 
greatest displays in the competition’s history.

Remember
 the time Emile Heskey produced his DJ celebration in Munich to add a 
surreal gloss to England’s most celebrated victory on foreign soil? It 
seems such a different time. Victory for Germany, after a 1-0 win at 
Wembley earlier in the campaign, would have sealed their place at the 
2002 World Cup.

But Sven Goran Eriksson masterminded a remarkable 
performance that allowed his team to get to the Far East first. Carsten 
Jancker opened the scoring early to give the game a familiar feel but 
then Michael Owen grabbed a hat-trick, Steven Gerrard scored a screamer,
 and Heskey added the coup de grace. Huge satisfaction against old 
rivals and a shock scoreline.

Hosts
 bombing at crucial moments is not the sole preserve of Brazilians. 
Portugal could have won the European Championship on home soil, 
claiming their first trophy in the process, only for Greece to arrive 
like a Trojan horse and crash the party.

The two sides had met in the 
opening game of the tournament with the same result but Portugal had 
grown and looked set to avenge the defeat.

A young Cristiano Ronaldo and
 an ageing Luis Figo could do nothing to stop the Greek game-plan of stifling 
and set-pieces as Angelos Charisteas headed in the only goal from a 
corner. Perhaps the least popular underdog victors in history.

Very
 rare it is to see a Jose Mourinho team torn to shreds. Usually he finds
 a way to stop the bleeding, to administer a tourniquet through tactical
 improvisation.

But in the Nou Camp, with tiki-taki clicking like 
clockwork his Real Madrid side were shot through time and again as the 
Catalans equalled their biggest victory in El Clasico. This, Mourinho’s 
first derby match between Spain’s big beasts, remains the worst defeat 
of his career.

Lionel Messi mesmerised but did not score, leaving it to 
Xavi, Pedro, David Villa twice and Jeffren to administer the fatal 
blows. Barca went on to win La Liga for the third consecutive year.

Time
 was when City were the butt of all jokes in Manchester; United 
unrivalled in their superiority under Sir Alex Ferguson as the blue half
 undid themselves in comical fashion, dropping as low as the third tier.
 But flush with financial impetus from Abu Dhabi billions, City 
travelled to Old Trafford to get serious.

Mario Balotelli scored twice 
(revealing his ‘Why Always Me?’ T-shirt) before Sergio Aguero made it 
three. Jonny Evans was sent off and Darren Fletcher responded as United 
chased the game but left themselves open to three goals in the final 
minutes through David Silva and an Edin Dzeko double.

It was United's 
worst home defeat since 1955 and the score proved decisive as City went 
on to win the Premier League on goal difference – their first-top flight
 title in 44 years.

This
 was the result that confirmed a 7-0 aggregate victory for the Bavarians
 and, more importantly, punctured the impregnability of Catalan dominance.

Barcelona had finessed a brand of high-pressing, one-touch football to 
such precision that it led to a permanent place at the business end of 
Europe’s premier competition and manifold trophies.

But Bayern trounced 
the team who had won the Champions League twice in four years by going 
for the jugular. Jupp Heynckes sent his side out with ruthless intent 
and Arjen Robben, Thomas Muller and a Gerard Pique own goal ensured a 
result to send tremors across the continent.
