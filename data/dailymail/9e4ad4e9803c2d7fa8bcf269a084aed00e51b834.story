It all started with Paris Hilton’s pet pooch, Tinkerbell, when she trotted out wearing a diamante collar back in 2005.

Fast forward eight years and the pet industry is now worth £2.7billion - with £500million alone spent on accessories.

And now one website is hoping to cash in on the growing demand for animal accessories by unveiling a luxurious range of cashmere sweaters and scarves for dogs.

Posh pet: Pets Pyjamas have launched a range of luxurious cashmere garments for dogs. One of the styles is this £49 scarf-like 'snood'

The garments start from £49 for a scarf-like ‘snood’ and run up to £99 for a cable knit sweater.

The on-trend knitwear collection, which is being sold on PetsPyjamas.com, features sumptuous cashmere turtlenecks in bubblegum pink and blue, stylish striped snoods and classic cableknit sweaters.

Each item, which is made from 100 per cent cashmere, has been designed by Ruby Rufus Isaacs and ethically made in Mongolia.

PetsPyjamas, which describes itself as a ‘one stop shop to find everything you need for the modern pet from basic collars and leads to high end designer products’, has seen business grow at a rate of 400 per cent over the last year with 150,000 pet fanatics visiting the website every month.

Another trend the pooch pampering site has noticed is the rise of owners dining out with their dogs.

Denise Elphick, co-founder of PetsPyjamas.com said: 'The real trend revelation is that really exclusive, four star and five star bars and restaurants are welcoming pets.

'Colbert in Sloane Square gives your dog a complimentary huge bone, The Bluebird has pet teatime treats and Le Maurice in Paris provides dog beds and engraved personalised dog tags.

'Even celeb hang out Riding House Café welcomes pets. It makes sense that these leading dining destinations encourage our canine companions since more pets that children in the UK and if they want our custom, we come with a four legged friend.'

Pet dining is big business and a host of new pet dining accessories such as collapsible dog bowls, Café Leads that hook to tables to keep your pooch a safe and Doggy Bags to make your pooch presentable prior to dining are on sale.

Speaking about the doggy dining trend, Barry, who is the celebrity Dog Jogger (or dog walker to normal folk) to Elle Macpherson, said: ‘To ensure your dog is well behaved when going out establish yourself as pack leader.

‘Always walk into your house and ignore your dog so he isn’t getting attention on demand.

‘Always make sure it you enter and exit through the door first. When in the street ensure your dog walks behind your or by your side, never in front.

Paw-dorable! Poochie Plumes- doggy hair extensions- are the latest dog accessory on the market. The £14.95 extensions are made from feathers and come in an array of colours and patterns, which aim to suit your dog's personality

‘Always act in a confident and relaxed way so that your dog doesn’t pick up anxious or unsure behaviour from you.

'When feeding your dog eat a snack first or before giving food so that they don’t expect food every time they see it and you always eat before they do.

‘All these things will mean that your dog will trust and follow your orders, just as they would in a pack. This is essential when going out with your pet in public places.'

Denise Elphick, co-founder of PetsPyjamas said: ‘Always take your dog for a walk before you go out to a restaurant so that they’re calm and well behaved when asked to sit for an extended period of time.

‘My most important tip is to ensure that your dog sits under the table, not under diners' feet. And you don’t to want to trip anyone up with long dog leads. Take a dog toy and a collapsible dog bowl.’

Rod Harris from Hurlingham added: ‘When out dining with your pet the key thing is to respect other people.

‘If you’re a good dog owner you’ll keep your pet well groomed as this is essential. Also never take a wet pet to a restaurant. They’ll be wet and smelly giving off D.O. (dog odour) which isn’t pleasant for fellow diners.’
