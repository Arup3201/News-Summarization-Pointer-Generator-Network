Tesco protest: Emma Thompson wants the supermarket to stay away

What are the biggest threats facing London today? Its soaring house prices? The continually expanding national debt? Extreme Islamist terrorists?

Apparently not, according to Oscar-winning actress Emma Thompson. For her, the most urgent problem is the terrifying ogre of another source of fresh, reasonably priced food.

She is campaigning to stop a new Tesco Express opening in Belsize Park, a charming neighbourhood near Hampstead Heath in North London, the heart of luvvie-dom and home of Left-leaning millionaires for half a century.

‘Belsize is a villagey area. It has no need of a Tesco and its very nature will be threatened,’ Thompson said in an open letter to Tesco.

‘The people who live there do not want it. They already have food shops, ones they trust and that retain a local feel to them. Wherever Tesco goes, the local feeling is destroyed by staff who neither know nor care to know the inhabitants.’

Thompson doesn’t actually live in Belsize Park — she lives in West Hampstead, two miles away from the proposed shop on Haverstock Hill. Still, why should that stop an actress with an inflated sense of self-worth telling genuine locals where they should do their shopping?

She isn’t the only one. Other actors to sign a 2,900-strong petition to stop the shop opening in a former bank include Dame Janet Suzman and James Corden.

‘This idea of plonking chain-store locals into village High Streets, I think, is damaging,’ said the Shakespearean actress at a local meeting to discuss the new shop. ‘What it does is put a kind of unwanted marker down in our manor.’

Leading the protest is another actor, Tom Conti, who says independent shops are the lifeblood of the area.

A photograph of Conti’s face greets you at the tills of nearby supermarket rival Budgens, also on Haverstock Hill. Next to his picture is the printed slogan: ‘WE DONT [sic] NEED, WE DONT [sic] WANT TESCO.’

Conti, best known for his roles in the 1989 film Shirley Valentine and as Miranda’s father in the BBC TV sitcom Miranda, is a one-man protest band in North London. In recent years he has also fought a housing development in nearby Kentish Town.

I’ve lived in millionaire luvvieland all my life — first in my parents’ house in Islington, North London, and now in Kentish Town, a mile away from the proposed Tesco.

And I’d be delighted if a new Tesco store opens. In fact, I’m delighted every time a cheap, reliable shop selling useful things, such as food and drink, opens. Conversely, my heart sinks when shops offering overpriced organic food and pointless knick-knacks start up.

Celebrity protests against cheap food outlets are nothing new. I can remember the ‘Battle of McDonald’s’ that raged through the Georgian High Street of nearby Hampstead in the Eighties.

For 12 years, from 1980 to 1992, the fast-food chain fought to open an outlet there, opposed by local activists who launched a ‘Burger off!’ campaign. Among them were Tom Conti, of course, and the novelist Margaret Drabble. ‘My loathing of McDonald’s is intense,’ Drabble said at the time. ‘There are advantages in development, provided it is the right sort, but there are already too many takeaway restaurants in Hampstead.’

That campaign was led by the now-deceased Peggy Jay, a Labour councillor and the mother of Peter Jay (the broadcaster and son-in-law of Labour PM Jim Callaghan).

You might have thought Labour supporters would be keen on food that is popular with less privileged voters. Not, though, when it’s being sold on their own doorstep.

When McDonald’s finally triumphed — after a battle in which the local council spent £25,000 of taxpayers’ money and which ended up in the High Court — a condition was that the restaurant had to be a middle class-friendly outlet. So it was given a discreet facade and classical music was played inside.

The only other time McDonald’s faced such opposition was in Martha’s Vineyard, in Cape Cod, Massachusetts — America’s equivalent of Hampstead luvvieland. There, the chain failed to open an outlet thanks to heavyweight objection from gilt-edged Nimbys including singer Carly Simon and actress Mia Farrow.

What must make the Tesco row even more infuriating for objectors is that the alternative plan for the site, which Tesco saw off, was a bid for a new restaurant from Nigel Platts-Martin, who owns five restaurants, including The Ledbury, a two-Michelin-starred establishment in even ritzier Notting Hill.

Now you see what the Leftie protesters are really after — upmarket, super-priced food. ‘What do we want? Lobster, tomato butter and basil, like at the Ledbury! When do we want it? After a first course of scallops, shaved kohlrabi [fancy cabbage], seaweed oil and frozen horseradish!’

A four-course lunch at The Ledbury, without wine or service, costs £80 — nothing for a multi-millionaire actress. For many Londoners, though, that’s a day’s wages.

But ordinary people don’t get a word in edgeways when they are drowned out by celebrities, who also don’t seem to care that Tesco is offering to provide 20 new jobs. ‘What on earth has it got to do with Emma Thompson?’ says Mark Bostridge, a writer who lives near the proposed shop. ‘She is a colossal busybody.’

‘Residents — many of whom live on limited budgets — are currently paying over and above what they could pay,’ said local Joseph Zarfaty in a letter to the local paper.

To be fair, about half the residents I talked to shared Emma Thompson’s views. For example, Neville Lewis, a retired barrister, said the Budgens was adequate. ‘There’s a fair range and it’s a pleasant place to shop. Another Tesco will impact on local grocery shops.’

Meanwhile, there’s another celeb protest brewing in this neck of the woods — against the mansion tax. This, too, is surrounded by a whiff of Left-wing hypocrisy.

The tax, which Labour says it would immediately introduce on houses worth more than £2 million if it wins the General Election in May, could mean people living in such homes having to pay, on average, an extra £23,595 a year.

Boy, oh boy! The traditionally Labour-supporting bigwigs in this neck of the woods — normally so keen on tax rises and punishing the rich — are dead against it. Most of them live in £2 million-plus houses.

This month Lord Mandelson, the Labour politician who lives in a house thought to be worth £8 million, attacked the tax, as have Labour peers Melvyn Bragg, who lives in a multi-million-pound home in Hampstead, and fertility doctor Professor Robert Winston.

Critics claim a branch of Tesco will have a damaging effect on local shops in the area (pictured above)

Tom Conti is also against such a tax being levied on the valuable Hampstead home he bought for a song 30 years ago. Last May, when the Lib Dems were proposing a similar tax, Conti said: ‘If the Stalinist Mr Clegg ever got his desire for a mansion tax, we wouldn’t be able to live here.’

The fact is, the millionaire celebrities want to keep this part of North London just as it was when they arrived here a generation ago. Or 55 years ago, in the case of Emma Thompson, who lives in the same West Hampstead street in which she was brought up.

In the golden days of the Sixties and Seventies, people could buy a double-fronted house in desirable North London for £30,000.

Now those same houses are going for £5 million and these fabulously rich actors want to preserve their neighbourhood just as it was, pulling up the drawbridge behind them — in just the same way that Labour politicians who went to grammar schools prevented others following their path by dismantling the selective schools that had done so much to help social mobility.

It’s increasingly hard to afford to live in North London these days. And if this anti-Tesco campaign has its way, fewer people will be able to do their shopping round here, either.
