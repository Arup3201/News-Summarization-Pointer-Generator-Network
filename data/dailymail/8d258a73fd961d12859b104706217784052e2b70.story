Britain is reviewing its arms exports to Israel following the upsurge of violence in Gaza, Downing Street said yesterday.

Over the past four years, arms export licences worth £42million have been granted to 130 UK defence manufacturers to sell military equipment to Israel.

The equipment has included ammunition, drones and armoured vehicles, as well as weapon control and targeting systems, bullet-proof garments and naval gun parts.

In response to the crisis in Gaza, however, the government has now established a review to check whether pending exports should go ahead.

Yesterday, David Cameron responded to the deadly attack on a school in Gaza by saying that international law stated that schools and civilian targets should not be targeted.

But he declined to say whether he believed the Israelis had targeted the school, where 10 died, or whether the country’s actions were ‘criminal’.

It comes following a simmering row between the Tories and Labour over what Ed Miliband described as the Prime Minister’s ‘silence’ over the action in Gaza.

Over the weekend, the Labour leader criticised Mr Cameron for his failure to tell Israel its conduct had been ‘unacceptable and unjustifiable’. But the Conservatives hit by back by saying his ‘ultra-critical’ comments would hamper the search for peace.

The row came as an Israeli strike killed 10 and wounded 35 at a United Nations school in the town of Rafah, which was being used as a shelter for people displaced by the 27-day conflict between Israel and Hamas.

On Sunday, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon described the attack as a ‘moral outrage and a criminal act’ and called for those responsible for the ‘gross violation of international humanitarian law’ to be held accountable.

Speaking yesterday, Mr Cameron said: ‘I think the UN is right to speak out in the way that it has, because international law is very clear that there must not be the targeting of civilians or the targeting of schools if that is what has happened.

‘The UN as the international body is right to speak out in the way it has.’

But the Prime Minister declined to make the same accusations himself. Pressed on whether he regarded the attack as a ‘criminal act’, he told the BBC: ‘I’m not an international lawyer, so that’s up to international lawyers.

‘But international law is very, very clear that the use of force always has to be proportionate and civilians should not be targeted.’

He added: ‘We obviously do think it is appalling the loss of life that there has been. From the start, though, we have also made the point that if the Hamas rocket attacks on Israel stop then that would be probably the fastest way to stop this conflict.’   

Pressed on whether there was a case for reviewing arms exports to Israel in light of the conflict, Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said this work was already underway.

‘We are currently reviewing all existing export licenses to Israel,’ she said. ‘Clearly each one is assessed on a case-by-case basis anyway when it’s granted, against strict criteria. We have one of the most rigorous systems in the world for licensing arms.’

She described the Rafah attack as a ‘particularly appalling incident’, adding that it was ‘not appropriate to be attacking people who are seeking shelter’.

International Development Secretary Justine Greening said the UK is to provide an extra £2million in emergency assistance to help provide mattresses, blankets, nappies, cooking equipment and other essential supplies for nearly 8,000 families who have fled the conflict in Gaza.

‘However vital the food, water and shelter that we are providing, ultimately we need an immediate and unconditional ceasefire which is respected by all sides,’ she said.

‘Only when the fighting stops can people begin to address some of the underlying causes of this conflict.'
