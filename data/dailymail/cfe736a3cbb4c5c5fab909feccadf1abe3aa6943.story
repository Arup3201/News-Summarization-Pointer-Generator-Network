GM has plans to put a Cadillac on the road in two years that won't require drivers to hold a steering wheel or put their foot on the gas.

GM is calling the new technology 'Super Cruise,' promising it will be able to master steering, acceleration, stopping-and-going in gridlocked traffic, and braking at highway speeds of 70 miles per hour.

Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra described the groundbreaking model in a speech to the Intelligent Transport System World Congress in Detroit.

GM's new communications system could help cars avoid crashing and reduce gridlock by having cars within 300 meters of each other communicate basic safety information. These vehicles could advise each other on speed, the direction cars are traveling, and location. If a driver ahead of your vehicle slams on their brakes, the information can be transmitted to other drivers to prepare for the sudden halt in traffic.

Those safety features will be even more useful when GM finishes developing its first intelligent highways in Detroit. Those roads will feature cameras and sensors to warn cars about upcoming traffic.

However, to operate these systems without using the steering wheel or pedals themselves, drivers must remain alert to take the wheel when traffic conditions need real judgement.

model featuring V2V, or 'vehicle-to-vehicle,' technology within the next two years.

The Super Cruise will initially be featured in the 2017 Cadillac CTS sedan, according to Road and Track.

That feature will enable cars to communicate with other cars, warn of traffic hazards, and ideally make roads safer.

'With Super Cruise, when there’s a congestion alert on
roads like California's Santa Monica Freeway, you can let the
car take over and drive hands free and feet free through the
worst stop-and-go traffic around,” Barra said. 'If the mood strikes you on the high-speed road from Barstow, California, to Las Vegas, you can take
a break from the wheel and pedals and let the car do the work.
Having it done for you -- that’s true luxury.'

CBS Boston notes that today's autonomous vehicles are required to have all the same manual controls that are found in normal vehicles, and a licensed driver operating the car must be able to take over at any moment.

GM is cautioning that this technology is not a self-driving car, and that drivers must be alert and able to take the wheel when traffic conditions require it.

'We’re rolling out active safety technology today. We’re
not going to wait until we have a driverless vehicle that can
work in 100 per cent of situations,' said Jon Lauckner, GM's chief technology officer. 'There’s a
lot that can be done before we get to the perfect driverless
technology.'

The Super Cruise will be available on in the second half of 2016.

GM is also partnering with Ford Motor Co., the University of Michigan, and the Michigan Department of Transportation to build 120-miles of 'intelligent highways' in Detroit.

The roads will be able to communicate with vehicles and warn of upcoming hazards using sensors and cameras.

GM officials promise any information gathered by the sensors will not be given to police to ticket drivers, and the Michigan Department of Transportation is calling it 'the largest deployment of connected vehicle and highway technology in the world.'

It's uncertain when the project will be completed.

The vehicle-to-vehicle communication protocols are being developed in conjuction with the NHTSA.

That's the same organization that's overseen GM's record 29 million recalls this year.

However industry analysts note that some buyers will worry about the car's safety features, especially after GM produced faulty ignition switches linked to 13 deaths.

'There is still a concern by consumers about the safety of
their vehicles because there’s been so many recalls,' said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with AutoTrader. 'This is going to take a while to win the confidence of
consumers.'

Barra tells reporters she knows the technology must be perfect to be a success.

'It’s critical that it works flawlessly every single
time,' Barra told reporters. 'When you look at what has got to
come together to make this happen -- not just for straight
driving on a section of highway, but for every city situation
you can imagine -- there’s quite a bit of technology that has to
come together to make this work.'

If GM, or any of the automakers competing to get the first self-driving car to consumers, can get the technology bug-free they might lower traffic fatalities and reduce gridlock.

In the U.S. alone, the cost of economic and social impact of car crashes is more than $870 billion annually, GM stated, citing figures from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

'It’s a chicken-and-egg technology,' said John Capp, GM’s
director of global safety strategies and vehicle programs. 'If nobody in two years from now
puts out a V2V car, then the first CTS off the line will have to
wait for the next CTS to talk to.'
