Must-have gadgets that filled British homes in the Sixties and Seventies are making a comeback.

Retailers say a combination of a fondness for retro-chic and the effects of austerity have seen a boom in sales of the Teasmade and the Hostess trolley.

SodaStream fizzy drink makers are also enjoying a revival, joining electric heated rollers, electric carving knifes and electric blankets on Christmas lists.

Then: The idea of the Teasmade was something of a hi-tech marvel when it hit popular culture in the late 1960s and through in to the 1970s

Now: Sales of quieter, modern versions of the Teasmade, such as this £54.95 Swan STM100 are booming

Popular: Sales of heated rollers are on the rise

Sales of heated trolleys, designed to 
keep food warm at dinner parties, are rising as more people eat at home 
rather than busting the family budget on dining out. Increased 
thriftiness is also behind the renewed popularity of SodaStreams, which 
save families money by letting them make fizzy drinks at a fraction of 
the supermarket price.

Tea-makers
 that combine an alarm clock, kettle and teapot to deliver a freshly 
brewed cuppa appeal to workers too busy to fit a sit-down breakfast into
 their morning routine.

The 
original idea for an automated tea-maker dates back to 1891 but 
Teasmades did not become a fixture on wedding lists and in many bedrooms
 until the 1960s.

Although 
sales declined in the 1980s, one found its way into Downing Street when 
John Major was Prime Minister in the 1990s. The design has undergone a 
makeover since the 1970s, when 300,000 a year were sold.

The most famous brand, Goblin, has been taken over by Swan.

John
 Lewis says sales of the £54.95 Swan STM100, said to be quieter than the
 old-fashioned Teasmade, are up by around 20 per cent on this time last 
year.

Will Jones, 
electricals buyer at John Lewis, said: ‘The classic Teasmade has done 
well because it is quite a quaint, almost comical, product.

‘The resurgence in popularity is a combination of the appreciation of the invention but also building a nostalgic concept.’

Retro: Sodastreams, which allow families to make their own fizzy water and drinks as a cheaper alternative to the real thing, are doing well

Suzanne
 Hothersall, commercial director of Crosslee, which manufactures Hostess
 trolleys, said sales are up between 30 and 40 per cent this Christmas.

‘Television
 programmes like Come Dine With Me mean that people are noticing how 
important the way they serve food is,’ she said. ‘In the last few years 
we have seen more of a focus on entertaining at home.’

Fiona
 Hope, managing director at SodaStream UK, said: ‘People tend to look to
 brands which remind them of happy childhood experiences, but that also 
meet the demands of modern-day living practically and efficiently.

‘Many
 may have had a SodaStream in the family when they were a child and are 
looking to replicate the experience with their own children.’

Popular: Television programmes such as Come Down With Me, which featured Robert Englund, Sally Morgan, Nicola McLean and Alex Reid in one episode, are thought to be behind the rise in gadgets geared towards entertaining at home

Today my day began, as it does every morning, at precisely 7am when my husband handed me a mug of scalding-hot tea.

No, I’m not lucky enough to have a spouse so devoted he’ll go downstairs in the cold and dark to put on the kettle. I have a Teasmade. Until recently, this was my embarrassing little secret. Tea-makers were old-fashioned, owned by pensioners, not young(ish) professionals.

But now it appears that I am at the vanguard of a new trend.

Still working: A typical 1950'S bedside Teasmade and alarm

I wasn’t always such a convert, even though my grandparents had a Goblin Teasmade, with its characteristic art deco-style square kettle and pot.

I have vivid memories of it sitting on a chair next to their bed, alongside the floral china cups and saucers – never mugs – they drank from. As a small child it was considered a treat to turn it on. Still, when my husband, Sam, announced he wanted one for his birthday six years ago – while we were still in our early 30s – I teased him mercilessly and refused to get him anything so fuddy-duddy.

His parents had to buy it for him. But I soon got used to waking to the sound of a click followed by gentle bubbling as the water started to heat.

The process would end about a minute later in a loud ‘whoosh’ as boiling water, pressurised by its own steam, shot from a kettle compartment into a teapot via a metal spout. Mugs had been primed with milk the evening before (it rarely goes off overnight) and, within seconds, tea was made.

I started to take it for granted so when, about a year ago, our £50 Swan Teasmade stopped heating water properly I encouraged Sam to buy a replacement. Unable then to find another Teasmade, we’ve since been using a Breville hot drinks maker, priced around £60.

There’s no teapot, and boiling water shoots straight into two cups, now ready with milk and a tea bag. While it produced a slightly ‘plasticky’ brew at the start, the tea now tastes fine, though Sam complains it produces far more steam.

Still, there’s no chance of us returning to the bad old days of trudging downstairs and I wonder if we’ll end up with grandchildren who will be, as I was all those years ago, transfixed by the magic of a Teasmade.
