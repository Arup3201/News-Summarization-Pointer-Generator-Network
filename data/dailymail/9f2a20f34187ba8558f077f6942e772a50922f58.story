Richard Hughes has effectively been crowned champion jockey for the third time after it was confirmed rival Ryan Moore will not ride in this country again this season.

Moore missed his two mounts at Lingfield on Tuesday and will now concentrate on forthcoming international commitments in America, Australia and Japan.

Hughes, who leads by five winners (160-155) had to miss the opening weeks of the season after a fall in Dubai and only nosed ahead of Moore last month. The season ends on November 8.

Hughes, 41, said: 'I wouldn't say I've been battling with Ryan, but it still feels sweet after the doctor told me I could be out for months when I was injured in Dubai.

'Because of that, I started a month behind everyone else and I didn't think I'd be able to catch Ryan.

'Winning this obviously means more to me than Ryan but it still feels sweet, especially winning it for a third time.

'There have been so many good days this year but if I had to pick one out I'd say Toronado coming back and winning first time out at Royal Ascot was very sweet.'

Moore is heading to Australia this weekend when he partners Aidan O'Brien's Adelaide in the Cox Plate.
