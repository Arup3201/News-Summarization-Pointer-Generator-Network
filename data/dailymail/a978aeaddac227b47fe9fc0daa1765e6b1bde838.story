These x-rays show a bullet lodged in a robbery victim's neck after she was shot in the face - and miraculously survived.

Mother-of-two Evelin Matamoros, 36, was leaving a Chinese restaurant in Miami, Florida on January 24 when she was approached by 20-year-old Kamiah Lanier.

Lanier allegedly demanded she give him her purse but even though she did, he shot her.

The bullet bounced off her cheek bone, travelled through her mouth, fractured her lower jaw bone, and then lodged itself in her neck, where it can be seen in the x-rays.

'She had a gunshot wound on the left 
side of her face,' Dr. Gabriel Ruiz, clinical instructor of surgery at 
Ryder Trauma Center at the Jackson Memorial Hospital, told Local News 10.

'There were many organs that could 
have been damaged with that trajectory. It's a very serious injury 
because of the location and the type of trauma she received.'

But Matamoros miraculously pulled through and in an astonishing show of bravery, helped detectives identify Lanier from a line up.

On Wednesday she will undergo reconstructive surgery in which Dr. Michael Peleg, an oral and
maxillofacial surgeon, will replace the area of her shattered jaw 
with a custom-fitted titanium plate.

Lodged: She was shot when a robber demanded she give him her bag - before shooting her anyway

'We think she'll be able to chew, (and) 
be able to open her mouth without any restriction,' he said. 'I'm very 
optimistic and I believe we can provide a very good result.'

Doctors say Matamoros will probably need 
three or four surgeries, and that her recovery could take as long as a year.

Matamoros was shot after Lanier approached her as she left the Cafe Ruyi restaurant last week in what police called a 'senseless crime'.

'He shoots her deliberately and in broad
daylight after she gives him her purse,' Officer Kenia Reyes with 
the Miami Police Department said.

An off-duty police officer saw Lanier
run into a parking lot after the shooting before watching a grey Dodge 
Charger speed away, investigators said.

The
officer reported the car's tag number and a Miami-Dade officer later 
saw the vehicle and stopped it, finding Lanier's sister in the car.

The
woman told officials she had driven her brother to the scene that day 
and gave officers a photograph of Lanier. Matamoro was then able to 
identify him as the shooter.

Police arrested Lanier at his Florida City home, where they also found Matomoro's purse.

Arrest: Kamiah Lanier, 20, allegedly shot Matamoros, stole her bag and fled the scene in a car

Caught: An off-duty police officer saw the car and noted down the plates, and Lanier was later arrested

He has been charged with one count of
armed robbery with a firearm, one count of attempted murder, one count 
of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and one count of use of
firearm during the commission of a felony.Â 

From hospital, Matamoros wrote a note on her Facebook page to thank everyone for their prayers.

'With
all my heart thank you for all the support that are giving me in this 
difficult situation that I'm going through,' she said. 'I'm very 
surprised and at the same time I feel very fortunate.

'Many
thanks to... authorities for arresting the individual with great 
success. Thanks to the staff of the Jackson hospital and the excellent 
care they are giving me.'
