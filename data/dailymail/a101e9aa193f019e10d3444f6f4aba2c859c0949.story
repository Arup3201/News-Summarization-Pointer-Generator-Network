neglectful nanny: Police say Kristen Jones left two young children locked inside a car on a hot day with the windows up

An Oregon nanny locked a two-month-old girl and a three-year-old boy in a car on a 90-degree day while she went tanning, authorities said.

Police arrested Kristin Jones, 23, of Portland, when concerned people called 911 last month after seeing the children inside the car drenched in sweat and crying for help. The windows were left closed, officials said.

Jones initially tried to claim the children’s mother was in the van with them, but eventually recanted her tale and said she lied out of fear, according to KOIN. The neglectful nanny pleaded not guilty Friday to multiple charges.

A witness who called 911 directed police to the suffering children when he arrived May 15 at 2.41 p.m., according to court documents reviewed by the station.

The nanny walked out of Sunblaze Tanning just as the officer was able to remove one of the children from the sweltering vehicle, police said.

The boy was ‘soaked in sweat’ and ‘the officer felt the heat radiating from (the child) through his bulletproof vest,’ authorities said.

She removed the young girl and everyone involved headed back into the tanning salon where she was soon arrested.

Her neighbors were shocked at the allegations.

Arraignment: Jones pleaded not guilty Friday to several charges brought against her for the callous crimes

‘That’s bad, it just shows you don’t care,’ said Randy Haynes. ‘That’s very selfish… you don’t leave kids in the car. They’re not animals, you don’t leave animals in the car either.’

‘That is somebody’s kid, why would you leave somebody in a car?’ Asked Sheila Drubecq. 'I can’t believe that happened.’

The case eerily echoes that of a Georgia father whose toddler son was found dead while locked inside a car with the windows up on a 91-degree day.

Authorities have not yet determined if that incident was an accident or if murder charges will be brought against the man.

Jones was arraigned Friday on two counts each of first-degree criminal mistreatment, recklessly endangering another, and first-degree child neglect. She was also handed one charge of driving on a suspended license.

The accused abuser is due back in court August 15.
