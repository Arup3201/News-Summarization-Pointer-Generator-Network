After weeks of torrential downpours, the bank holiday weather will at least offer some respite from the rain.

Instead of a soaking, most parts of the country will experience only light showers.

But that’s where the good news ends, as temperatures remain stubbornly low – and there could even be light snowfall on northern high ground on Sunday when the mercury dips to -2c (28f) overnight.

Chance of snow: Temperatures remain stubbornly low, and there could be light snowfall in Scotland and the north of England this bank holiday

Freeze: Parts of Britain could be seeing scenes like these that hit earlier this year as the normally warm Atlantic air that heats the UK in May is forced out by a band of freezing air

Elsewhere, daytime temperatures tomorrow will linger around 10c (50f) in both the South and the North, rising to 11c (52f) in both regions on Sunday.

Monday will be slightly warmer in the South, with highs of 13c (55f), but around 10c (50f) in the North.

Met Office forecaster Sarah Holland said: ‘It will be quite chilly throughout the weekend with low-level cloud and patchy light rain. It will be a lot drier than we have seen this week. But next week will see more unsettled weather, with rain returning from Tuesday.’

It is usually around 16c (61f) at this time of year. The Met Office say temperatures will get back to normal by the middle of May. Seaside resorts say the chilly bank holiday will cost them millions of pounds.

Bournemouth area hospitality association chairman, Andrew Woodland, said: ‘Visitor spending will be down by around £1million this weekend due to the weather, with hotels at just average occupancy, around 70 per cent. Last-minute visitors will feel it’s best to stay at home and do the DIY rather than get wet down here.’

It is also bleak news for farmers and food lovers after the wettest April for 100 years hit the asparagus harvest.

Growers usually start cutting the green spears by the end of April, but so far hardly any have appeared, forcing supermarket prices up from £6 to £10 per kilo.

This weekend’s British Asparagus Festival in Evesham, Worcestershire, has had to be cancelled. Andy Allen, chairman of the Asparagus Growers’ Association, said: ‘Asparagus requires warm and dry soil in April in order to grow.

‘It is the same picture across the UK. There is virtually nothing out there.’

The south of England was swept by flood warnings yesterday as torrential rain swept across the country, with Suffolk and Essex the worst affected.

And this schoolboy probably got good marks from his teacher for battling on his bicycle over a flooded footpath in Witham, near Chelmsford, Essex to make it to classes after the River Brain burst its banks.

By Thursday evening, the Environment Agency had 25 flood alerts in place in East Anglia, 13 in the Midlands, and 23 across the South-East.

Despite a week of heavy rainfall, the hosepipe ban across the south-east of England remains in force.

A
Met Office spokesman told Mail Online: 'Towards the late part
of this week and over the weekend, there could be snow flurries across 
the top of the Scottish mountains.

'There will be a slightly cooler feel to
the weekend. Certainly we expect a light frost over the weekend, with 
the coldest nights being Saturday and Sunday.'

The cold snap is the
result of unusually cold outflow from the Arctic which could see some 
of the coldest May temperatures for years.

Asparagus lovers may have to pay more for the luxury vegetable after days of rain caused a severe shortage.

At this time of year, the spears would normally put on a spurt of growth as the weather improves.

Yesterday, the British Asparagus Festival in the Vale of Evesham had to be cancelled because there was not enough to go around.

The attraction - at the heart of asparagus-growing country - was expected to pull in thousands of visitors, but organisers said supplies were too low - and their venue was flooded.

A widespread frost is expected to 
blanket northern England and Scotland by Saturday morning with Met 
Office forecaster Dan Williams predicting that after a drier Friday 
there will be a dramatic drop in temperatures going into the bank 
holiday weekend.

The lowest recorded temperatures for May are -8.9C in Braemar, Scotland, in 1927 and -9.4 in Lynford, Norfolk in 1941.

Normally warm Atlantic air heats the 
UK in May but this is being forced out by a band of freezing air from 
the Arctic and Scandinavia.

Independent forecaster Netweather said bitter winds would make it feel like -9C by Saturday.

Figures released by the Met Office show April was the wettest on record with nearly five inches of rain helping to fill reservoirs which were at extremely low levels.

It was the coldest April since 1989 and one of the coldest Aprils on record with a spokesman reporting that average temperatures for the month were lower than those for March for most of the UK.
