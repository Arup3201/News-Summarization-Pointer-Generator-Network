A top Russian diplomat has accused the U.S. of trying to use sanctions over the crisis in Ukraine to engineer a regime change in Moscow.

'It is hardly a secret that the goal of the sanctions is to create social and economic conditions to carry out a change of power in Russia,' said deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov.

'There will be no easy or fast way out of this.'

Under pressure: Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting with Francois Hollande, France's president, on Saturday. Moscow believes U.S. sanctions are an attempt to engineer regime change

Russian President Vladimir Putin has struck a belligerent tone in his relations with the West, particularly over the crisis in Ukraine and the gradual spread eastwards of Nato. 

His inner circle has been personally targeted by economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. and the EU, touted as an attempt to erode support for his policies at the highest level in Russia.

Speaking in the lower house of Russia's parliament, Mr Ryabkov told deputies relations between Moscow and Washington were in a deep chill and were likely to remain so if sanctions continued.

Ties between Russia and the U.S. took a dive this year as the Cold War-era foes traded accusations following a coup which brought to power a new pro-West government in Ukraine.

Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian province of Crimea, site of a major Russian naval base, while partisans seized towns in the east and refused to recognise Kiev's new regime.

Holy place: Mr Putin and Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia, right, visit the renovated Church of St. Sergius of Radonezh at the Tsarskoye Selo State Museum-Preserve in St Petersburg 

Tragedy: A grave of an unknown soldier killed fighting for the airport outside the rebel-held city of Donetsk, east Ukraine. The airport itself has been totally destroyed in fighting between rebels and government forces

Well armed: Pro-Russian separatists ride on a tank at the town of Khartsyzk, east of Donetsk. Nato and Kiev say that Russia has been providing material support, including weapons and manpower, to the insurgency

Kiev and Nato have accused Russia of providing material support to the insurgency, while Moscow has accused the West of helping to engineer Ukraine's coup and supporting fascist groups which now hold positions in government.

Last week the U.S. House of Representatives approved a resolution that would authorise President Barack Obama to openly send weapons to the Kiev government. Although that still needs approval from the Senate, it would mark a serious escalation of the conflict. 

President Putin has portrayed Western sanctions as an attempt to contain Russia and punish it for becoming strong and independent, an opinion echoed by influential Russian media.

In his state-of-the-nation address last week, the Russian president accused the the West of ‘trying to build a new Iron Curtain’.

He claimed Russia was asserting its ‘sovereignty and national pride’ over its dealings with neighbouring Ukraine – and said his country’s survival depended on it.

Also well armed: Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko shakes hands with a soldier from a mechanised infantry brigade as he presented the unit with 100 units of heavy arms, including tanks and helicopters

Soon to be even better armed: Last week the U.S. House of Representatives approved a resolution that would authorise President Barack Obama to openly send weapons to the Kiev government

Claiming the West wanted to see a Yugoslav-style ‘collapse and dismemberment’ of Russia, he said: ‘This has not happened. We did not allow it.

‘Hitler also failed when, with his hateful ideas, he was going to destroy Russia, throw us back behind the Urals. Everyone should remember how it ended.’

An opinion poll released by the independent Levada research group on Monday showed 74 per cent of Russians have negative views of the U.S.

Levada said the figures marked the lowest point in Russians' attitudes towards the United States since 1990, the year before the Soviet Union collapsed
