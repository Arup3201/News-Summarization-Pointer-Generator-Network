A sex killer who is currently serving life for four rapes and three murders is planning to appeal his sentence - and wants police to dig out more than 6,000 documents to help him.

David Mulcahy and his schoolfriend John Duffy became known as the 'Railway Rapists' after trawling train lines targeting lone victims in London and south east England in the 1980s. 

Duffy was jailed for life in 1988, but it was not until 2001 that he named his accomplice as 55-year-old Mulcahy from Chalk Farm in north London and he was also jailed.

David Mulcahy, 55, (pictured in 1999) who was dubbed one half of the 'Railway Rapists', is appealing his prison sentence. He wants the Metropolitan Police to release all records about him to prove his innocence

Despite the conviction, Mulcahy has maintained he is innocent and wants the Metropolitan Police to release every single detail they have about him on their records.

He took the force to court today and told a judge that the documents are vital in proving his innocence.

But officers have refused to release the information, saying it could take weeks or even months of costly work to get it together, and it would be 'disproportionate' to make such a huge effort.

John Potts, Metropolitan Police data protection officer,  told Central London County Court that the documents, if piled on top of each other, would be more than three feet high.

He added that to work through the 6,000 documents would take 23 full working days and would likely lead them to more documents that would eat up a similar amount of time.

There would also have to be meetings with victims' families, senior officers and others mentioned in the papers before they could be released, he said.

The force's barrister, Robin Hopkin, said: 'My client has provided all the information it holds that can be provided without it undertaking disproportionate levels of burden in terms of cost and time.'

But Mulcahy, appearing via a video link from Full Sutton Prison, said the force is obliged under the Data Protection Act to give him everything he wants.

'I should be entitled to all the documents that the police hold,' he told Judge Margaret Langley. 'I am preparing an appeal and I need those documents for the appeal. I am fighting for liberty and life.'

The judge said a decision on the case would not be made until later this year.

Mulcahy was given three life sentences for the murders of Alison Day, 19, Dutch schoolgirl Maartje Tamboezer 15, and newlywed Anne Lock, 29, in 2001. 

David Mulcahy and John Duffy were described chillingly as 'two bodies with one brain' for the way they hunted for women to rape and murder.

Mulcahy and Duffy were drawn together as a pair of 11-year-olds on their first day of school in 1970.

They were bullied at school and built an alliance, becoming obsessed with martial arts.

Alison Day (left), 19, was visiting her fiancé when they pulled her off Hackney Wick platform, raped her twice, and strangled her with her blouse. Maartje Tamboezer (right), 15, was raped, killed and badly burned by the pair. She was cycling home from school in Horsley, Surrey, when they tripped up her bike with a fishing line

Just two years later, Mulcahy was suspended from Haverstock Hill Comprehensive, in Chalk Farm, north London, after killing a hedgehog by stamping on its head.

Duffy stood by laughing.

As they grew older, their larks became much more sinister.

They planned and executed their murders together, down to the tissues Duffy carried in a matchbox to wipe away and burn forensic evidence.

They went on what they called 'hunting parties' cruising along singing to Michael Jackson's hit song Thriller as they searched for lone women to rape and murder.

Going out at night and weekends in search of prey, they would prolong their excitement by comparing victims after each attack.

They tossed a coin to decide who should be first to rape before murdering them.

 victim: Anne Lock, 29, pictured on her wedding day, disappeared after 
leaving work at London Weekend Television in north London four weeks 
after getting married. The pair raped and killed her in a nearby field

For their first attack, they had 
planned a kidnap using false names and accents, kitting themselves out 
with balaclavas, sticky tape and knives.

It didn’t work because the pair became 'nervous', Duffy later said.

Nevertheless, they had snatched a young woman off the street in the early hours and raped her in turn behind a wall.

Then,
 over the next four years, they embarked on a campaign that would claim 
them a joint place in the criminal record books as history’s most 
prolific rapists.

Despite their silence pact, John Duffy gave evidence against Mulcahy when he was sentenced to 30 years for his crimes.

At the Old Bailey in 2001, Mulcahy was
 given three life sentences for the murders of Alison Day, 19, Dutch 
schoolgirl Maartje Tamboezer 15, and newlywed Anne Lock, 29.

He was also convicted of seven rapes and five conspiracies to rape.
