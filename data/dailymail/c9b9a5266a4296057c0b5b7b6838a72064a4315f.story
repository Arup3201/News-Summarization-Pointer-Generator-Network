A Colorado cabbie has transformed his taxi into a non-stop party-mobile, complete with mirror ball, musical instruments and hundreds of LED lights that change colour in time to the music.

Jon Barnes calls his creation 'a cross between 'Bill Gates' home office, the Starship Enterprise and a Beatles concert' and it has a attracted a very classy kind of clientele.

Star Wars George Lucas, Clint Eastwood, Ringo Starr and Michael Douglas have all hitched a ride in his wacky wheels.

Jon Barnes in his taxi: 'A cross between Bill Gates' home office, the Starship Enterprise and a Beatles concert'

Barnes says: 'When people climb into the car, they're really climbing into my world and into my mind.

'I take them on an amazing expansive journey of imagination, colour and music that they've never experienced before and never will experience again to that degree.'

Psychedelic: The car features mixing board, mirror ball, and 900 LED lights that change colour to the music

He explains: 'The Ultimate taxi was a garden variety taxi driving the streets of Aspen in the mid 1980s, but I wanted to have more fun than other cab drivers when there was nobody being transported.'

So Barnes began to put musical instruments in the car - keyboards, drums and sequencers -  he even taught himself how to play the piano while waiting for the phone to ring with another potential fare.

Besides the synthesizers, keyboards, lasers, fog effects, fibre optics, neon, black light and drums and mini wind instrument, there's a laptop computer where he spins and mixes the music.

'It's a lot of fun making people smile and happy,' says Barnes.

'Most people who come to Aspen are on vacation and they're looking for something fun and unusual that they won't see anywhere else and I try to provide that experience
