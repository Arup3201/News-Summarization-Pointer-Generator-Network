TLC has pulled an episode of Cake Boss from future screening schedules after receiving complaints over the show's mishandling of a transgender guest star.

The episode, which aired on Monday night, showed transgender Carmen Carerra, 27, who was born as a man, take part in a stunt that she believed was edited to look distasteful.

The stunt involved Buddy 'Cake Boss' Valastro, the reality show's star, tricking Anthony 'Cousin Anthony' Bellifemine into believing that Miss Carerra was born as a woman.

Controversy: TLC have halted all future airings of Monday night's episode of Cake Boss which featured a transgender woman (right) and one of the show's stars Anthony Bellifemine (left), after receiving complaints

Surprise: Mr Bellifemine (right) was shocked by news that Carmen Carrera was born a man. The reaction later turns to disgust and he threatens to leave the bar they had been partying in

After the episode aired, Miss Carerra, a
former star of the reality series RuPaul's Drag Race, wrote on herÂ Facebook page that she believed the show turned her involvement into a 
'Jerry Springer, "THAT'S A MAN" kind of thing'.

The New Jersey-based transgender woman claimed that she had signed onto the show as an example of how 'a beautiful transgendered woman' can get 'hit on at a bar' and 'IT'S OK!'.

Fans of Miss Carerra wrote on her Facebook page about their disappointment over the show.

One person wrote: 'This whole thing sucks... you are so beautiful and talented. You don't need to build your career on being a victim.'

Another wrote: 'The last time I checked transgender meant born in the wrong body... so my final statement is 
"YOU ARE A FULL BLOWN, VERY REAL WOMAN!".'

TLC told the Los Angeles Times: 'TLC can confirm that the episode was immediately removed from rotation after learning of Carmen Carrera and her supporters' concerns, and the network is reviewing the content to see whether it could be reintroduced following edits.'

Repeats of the episode did not run but the network added that the episode may air again without the controversial scene.

During the episode, Mr Valastro is 
seen telling the cameras: 'We had this really pretty girl set up and he 
[Mr Bellifemine] went hook, line and sinker, he didn't even look at any 
other girls. He went right for her.'

Footage
then shows Miss Carrerra flirting with Mr Bellifemine in a bar as the 
pair down shots of liquor and she even gives him a peck on the cheek.

Mr Valastro
later reveals that she was in fact born as a man, news that Mr 
Bellifemine is shown to be clearly unimpressed by as he is shown 
threatening to leave the party in disgust.

Producers
on the show even show footage of the reactions of onlookers in the bar,
as they attempt to depict horror spreading throughout the entire scene 
as a result of the reveal.

Mr Valastro tells the cameras: 'So 
Carmen was all about having fun and pranking Anthony, she loves little 
pranks like this... Carmen loved the fact that they thought she was 
attractive.'

He adds: 'That's a man, baby!'

The
guest star is seen telling the cameras later in the scene: 'Listen, it 
was so easy to get Anthony. Ladies out there, all you need to do is 
dress really, really cute and put on some pink lip gloss and Anthony 
will be all over you.'

Joker: Buddy 'Cake Boss' Valastro is shown to have set up the stunt and says: 'Carmen loves little pranks'

Trick: Miss Carerra (right) is shown flirting with Mr Bellifemine (left) who is unaware that she was born a man

Chemistry: Mr Bellifemine is clearly taken by the woman, posing for a picture with her for an onlooker

Miss Carerra wrote after viewing the episode: 'LET ME MAKE THIS VERY CLEAR! LISTEN UP PEOPLE! I signed on to do this 
episode of Cake Boss to promote EQUALITY. Transgender women are just 
as beautiful as biological woman and should be respected for that.'

She continued: 'The reveal was never meant to be a "Jerry 
Springer, THAT'S A MAN..." kind of thing. I was promised that it wasn't
going to be that way. I was lied to. I don't promote misleading someone 
or putting down the trans community. I am a beautiful transgendered 
woman and if a guy hits on me at a bar, ITS OK! That was the message.

'Hearing things like "You'll never be a real woman"... is the 
EXACT TYPE OF IGNORANCE THAT THIS SHOW HELPED TO PROMOTE,' she wrote. '

This is why I'm
so upset. If men find me attractive and treat me as a lady, why do some 
of you people think it's wrong??? Why are some of you trying to take that
away from me like I dont deserve to be treated with respect and 
admiration? Ignorance, that's why. STOP THE HATE AND PASS THIS ON.'

Disgust: The subject of the prank is immediately turned off Miss Carerra when he learns her secret

Onlookers: The episode even includes footage of other bar goers (above) looking on in shock

Unaware: Miss Carerra (right) claimed she did not know the prank would treat her sexuality with insensitivity

She even launched a petition on the website Change.org in an attempt to receive an apology from TLC over the representation.

It reads: 'Before filming, Carmen educated 
producers on what terms to use and what phrases would not be offensive, 
i.e. "Carmen was BORN male" or "Carmen is a transgendered woman". 
Producers AGREED to respect her wishes, however, when the show aired it 
was a blatant "THAT'S A MAN" moment.'

The petition received more than 8,800 signatures.
