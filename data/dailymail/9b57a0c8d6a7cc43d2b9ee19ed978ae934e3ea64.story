Formula 1 fans were forced to miss yesterday’s qualifying sessions for the British Grand Prix after torrential rain turned public car parks into mudbaths.

Those heading to the big race today were told to leave plenty of time to reach Silverstone and warned: Bring your wellies.

There was chaos at the circuit in Northamptonshire yesterday when 20,000 ticket-holders were told to stay away because officials wanted to give surfaces a chance to recover after huge downpours on Friday.

For today’s race, there is a 50-50 chance of rain.

Meanwhile, families were forced to flee their homes yesterday after devastating floods wreaked havoc across Britain.

The Red Cross, which had teams of 
volunteers on alert around the country, was called in to help evacuate 
residents in the Leicestershire village of Sheepy Magna after 13 houses 
were flooded.

In Yealmpton, Devon, 40 homes were 
swamped by 6ft of water when the River Yealm burst its banks after four 
inches of rain fell in 24 hours – the average for the whole of July is 
2.5in.

Police said a driver in his 20s was 
killed yesterday when his car left the road during torrential rain in 
East Tynedale, Northumberland, forcing the temporary closure of the A1.

The Environment Agency still had 76 
flood warnings and 140 flood alerts across England and Wales in place 
last night, with two severe flood warnings – alerting people to a threat
 to life – in Devon and Dorset.

‘What we’ve seen over the past 24 hours is exceptional,’ said Michael Lawrence, of the Met Office.

But the bad news is that the summer 
washout shows no sign of abating. Forecasters warned that unsettled 
conditions were likely to carry on until the start of the Olympics.

Billionaire F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone
 was among those advised not to turn up at Silverstone, while fans who 
were not planning to drive in were free to use a park and ride service 
or attempt the long walk in through sodden conditions.

Silverstone managing director Richard
 Phillips last night issued an 'unreserved apology' to ticket holders, 
adding the incident had almost reduced him to tears.

Mr
 Phillips said the financial hit is likely to run into seven figures, 
which for this season could mean turn a profit into a loss.

He
 said organisers were in emergency meetings every two hours yesterday 
with the police, highways agencies, county council, emergency planning 
to 'try and resolve the issues', adding: 'There will be 20,000 to 30,000
 people we won't be able to properly cater for.'

Mr Phillips said: 'It's going to cost us a 
lot of money. I honestly don't know the figure, but it could be a lot 
more than hundreds of thousands.

'For people who did not get in we're offering refunds, and for anybody who doesn't get in we'll be offering refunds as well.'

On-site
 parking passes sold out at a price of £65 for the weekend or £53 for 
Sunday's main event. Tickets to the event itself cost up to £425 for the
 full three days.

Not everyone was letting the bad weather ruin their F1 fun. Some fans made the most of the soggy conditions as a chance to showcase their colourful wellies

Mr Phillips added: 'Right now we're 
trying to get ourselves into a situation to get in as many people as we 
can from a position of devastation.

'But I unreservedly apologise to 
people. I feel very responsible for it, this is something I've been very
 proud of over the years and I almost could cry now.'

Problems started when a deluge of up to 40 millimetres of rainfall fell in just 12 hours.

By mid-afternoon all campsites in and around Silverstone had to be closed.

With camping grounds sodden, caravans
 and motorhomes had to be escorted in one at a time when ordinarily they
 would have driven straight in, backing up the traffic.

Crucially, it is the loss of the car 
parks that caused major headaches for all concerned as they hope for 
them to dry out in time for the main event tomorrow afternoon.

Those without wellies opted to either to take the risk with their summer shoes, or went without altogether, left

Mr Phillips added: 'We'll have to see where we are tomorrow, and then we'll have to have another look tomorrow about Sunday.

He said racing supremo Mr Ecclestone was contacted and told not to bother turning up.

Mr Phillips said: 'We dissuaded him from coming in. He was coming in by road, but he could have been five hours, I guess.'

Those who made it to the circuit 
yesterday were greeted by conditions that were far from the glamorous 
image often associated with the sport. Men and women were forced to don 
their 
wellies - some even went barefoot - to circumnavigate the flooded fields
 and paths around the course.

In scenes reminiscent of the recent 
Isle of Wight festival, traffic queues and cars abandoned in sodden 
muddy fields yesterday were brightened up by those digging deep to maintain their 
determined British spirit.

Loyal spectators, undeterred by the miserable July weather, erected colourful umbrellas, many opting for the Union Jack design.

Others came prepared in 
bright-coloured wellies and waterproof layers, while others sheltered 
from the rain in Silverstone ponchos.

Torrential rain started to hit the UK
yesterday morning, bringing with it misery on the A43 where a ten-mile 
traffic jam built up as drivers tried to get to the Grand Prix 
circuit.

On Friday evening the Environment Agency had issued a total of 62 flood warnings, and 145 flood alerts.

The highest risk of flooding shifts 
from the North West, North East and the Midlands on Friday to the South 
West on Saturday, offering a glimmer of hope that conditions will 
improve somewhat for the event.

The meeting stretches over three days, starting today, and last year it attracted more than 150,000 Formula One fans.

Communities in the north and east of England, the Midlands and much of Wales were warned by the Environment Agency to brace themselves for flooding as two bands of very heavy rain were set to cross the UK today and into tomorrow

The wet weather and flood warnings have prompted race organisers to put in extra measures for fans.

The drenched circuit and spectators 
bore far from a resemblance to the glamorous image of the event that 
is painted on the Silverstone website.

It says: 'Few sporting occasions 
match the intensity, glamour and drama of the Formula 1 Santander 
British Grand Prix and whether a wide eyed first timer or seasoned 
veteran the experience is breathtaking.'

Sadly it appeared to be breathtaking for the wrong reasons.

The website says spectators are 
treated to a host of additional entertainment, including 'air displays' 
however given the terrible conditions it was not known if these would go
 ahead.
