Al Qaeda is using the leaks from US spy Edward Snowden to help its fighters evade Western surveillance technology, MailOnline can reveal.

The terrorist group has issued new video guidance based on what they have learnt about Western spying methods from the Snowden disclosures which have been made public on the internet.

The move confirms the worst fears of British and American intelligence chiefs who warned that Snowden's betrayal would play into the hands of the terrorists. The video even uses footage of news reports of the Snowden leak, highlighting how 'NSA is tracking millions of phones'.

Guide: The seven and half minute video released by a media platform for Al Qaeda and other jihadist groups, provides detailed graphics on how terrorists can avoid detection

Snowden leak: Snowden revealed that the NSA and GCHQ was harvesting millions of emails, instant messaging contact lists and internet browsing history.

Al Qaeda guidance: 'All your calls, messages and internet history are stored in this same place….spies have access to these files and can know your daily routine, friends and what you are planning to do tomorrow night at that tall building….’

Snowden leak: Showed Western agencies have the capacity to track and map the location of cell phones and was using cookies to 'piggyback' on the same tools used by internet advertisers 'to pinpoint targets for government hacking and to bolster surveillance.'

Al Qaeda guidance: 'All mobile phone providers use the same software, your device continuously is in contact with the nearest tower……….As you are moving around your different coordinates are tracked and stored.'

Snowden leak: The NSA's top-secret 'black budget', obtained from Snowden by The Washington Post, exposed the 'successes and failures' of the 16 spy agencies comprising the US intelligence community, and revealed that the NSA was paying private tech companies for 'clandestine access' to their communications networks.

Al Qaeda guidance: The video warns Al Qaeda agents that spies are working with internet companies. Using a chart Al Qaeda even links Western countries, including the UK and the US, with named internet companies it claims they are working with. 

It comes after David Cameron travelled to America to urge Barack Oabama to put pressure on US Internet giants to co-operate more fully with intelligence and security agencies in the fight against terrorism.

A seven and half minute video released by a media platform for Al Qaeda, and other jihadist groups, provides detailed graphics on how terrorists can avoid detection by what it calls the 'FBI Secret Spying technology' when using phones and computers. 

It identifies Western countries, including the UK, and the computer companies that it claims works with them. And, worryingly, Al Qaeda has published a list of software packages to protect against surveillance and where to find it on the internet.

Spoken in Arabic but with English sub-titles it says: 'Allah created us with a unique voice, this can be used to track you anywhere no matter (sic) you buy a new phone, simcard or satellite.' 

It adds: 'We will now show you some different ways how the enemy can track you and have a view at some modern war technologies. 

'All mobile phone providers use the same software, your device continuously is in contact with the nearest tower... As you are moving around your different coordinates are tracked and stored. All your calls, messages and internet history are stored in this same place… spies have access to these files and can know your daily routine, friends and what you are planning to do tomorrow night at that tall building…'

'Every Mujahed that does not take the right precautions can be a tool in the hand of the enemy. With his phone, tablet or laptop the enemy can listen/record all conversations and meetings.  

Adrian Culley, a former senior detective with the Metropolitan Police’s Computer Crime Unit, who has seen the video, said: 'It is clear the Snowden leaks have raised cyber security issues in the minds of terrorists. This video is concerned with techno fear and propaganda. 

'We are in an cyber arms race with the terrorists and the security agencies have to be always one step ahead of the jihadists who only need to be lucky once to score a terrorist hit.' 

The video also exhorts people not to trust the 'kuffar' when using technology, reminding them: 'You have the power to let these spies know what YOU want them to know.'

It also replays media reports of how Western agencies use a range of technology to pinpoint the location of millions of people.

Fears: The heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ have all warned that Edward Snowden's exposé could educate a whole new generation of extremists

Al Qaeda warns its agents: 'Safe houses should in crowded cities and have different entries. Know your surroundings, keep your face down, the cameras are everywhere. Have a special place for Internet and phone use. If you are being monitored, they will do anything to catch you.' 

The heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ have all warned that Snowden's exposé could educate a whole new generation of extremists about how best to exploit the power of the web to peddle their militant ideology.

And as far as Islamist terrorists fighting in Iraq and Syria are concerned, to have a 'Snowden-approved' security system on their mobile phones and personal computers is to possess the ultimate in internet accessories.

During his work as a contractor at America's National Security Agency (NSA), Snowden gathered information about how it and its British equivalent, the GCHQ listening centre at Cheltenham, accessed social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook to monitor the activities of terrorists.

New tech: The video even warns jihadists that fingerprints can be traced through their touchscreen phones to internet databases

Last week Jonathan Evans, who stood down as head of MI5 in April 2013, used his maiden speech in the House of Lords to deliver a devastating analysis of the harm caused by Snowden, who stole and leaked thousands of documents in June 2013 detailing intelligence-gathering techniques used by Western intelligence agencies. He now lives in an undisclosed location in Russia.

The revelations have led to terrorists changing the way they communicate. They have also made internet companies less willing to co-operate with MI5 and GCHQ for fear of upsetting privacy campaigners.
