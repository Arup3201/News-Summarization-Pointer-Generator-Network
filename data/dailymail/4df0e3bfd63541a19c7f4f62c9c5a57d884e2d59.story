Marouane Fellaini has been working his way back to full fitness by training hard on a beach in Belgium during the international break.

The big-haired midfielder appeared to be heading out of Old Trafford last month, with Rafael Benitez's Napoli seemingly keen, but an ankle injury put an end to any potential move. 

Fellaini is now determined to force his way back into Louis van Gaal's plans, and his work on Sint Anneke Beach in Antwerp certainly suggests his commitment to the cause.

There does, though, appear to be some confusion between at Old Trafford. 

Fellaini stated on his official Instagram page that he was a week away from full fitness, but at around the same time Van Gaal declared that his midfielder wouldn't be ready for a month.

It remains to be seen, then, how long it will be until the Belgian returns to the fold. 

The midfielder joined Manchester United for £27.5million on transfer deadline day last season, but struggled to make much of an impact as he failed to register a single goal in 15 starts for the club.

And he has fared little better so far this season, entering a fray as a second half substitute during the Premier League opener against Swansea, only to see Gylfi Sigurdsson score the winner in a 2-1 defeat, before picking up the injury has seen him ruled out of the three games since.
