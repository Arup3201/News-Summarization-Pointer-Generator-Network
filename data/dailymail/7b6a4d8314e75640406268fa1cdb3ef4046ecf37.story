Return: Nicolas Sarkozy is set to announce  that he will stand for the French presidency in 2017

Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy is poised to launch his bid for re-election as leader in 2017, it was revealed today.

Sarkozy, 59, is set to announce this weekend that he will stand for the presidency of the centre-right opposition UMP party, insiders said.

The former leader had told journalists they would 'never hear from him again' after he lost the election to socialist Francois Hollande in the 2012 election.

But he then announced last year that he was considering standing for re-election because the socialists were 'ruining France'.

Disastrous left-wing policies left him 'no choice' but to make a challenge for the leadership, he said.

He added: 'Looking at the disastrous state France risks finding itself in, I will have no choice in 2017.

'The question is not knowing whether I'm going to make a come-back, but if morally I have the choice regarding France to not come back... Morally, I can not let the French people down.'

His political comeback is said by friends to be strongly opposed by his own wife Carla Bruni, who has 'begged him' not to stand because people were 'mean to him' as president.

Sarkozy's leadership bid could also be hindered by a raft of corruption charges he faces over illegal campaign funding.

He is accused of accepting illegal party funding payments from France's richest woman and L'Oreal heiress Lilian Bettencourt in return for tax breaks.

He has accused the country's socialist government of 'framing' him with the charges and branded the accusations 'grotesque'.

Pascal Perrineau, of the Institute of Political Studies in Paris, said: 'If he becomes UMP president, Sarkozy's political agenda will be constantly pushed around by an investigation into this case or that case, by a judge summoning him for questioning.

French Prime Minister Manuel Valls won a vote of confidence yesterday in a tense ballot, allowing him to push through economic reforms that have divided his Socialist Party.

The government's once comfortable margin was diluted in the 269-244 vote, with 53 abstentions.

The result denies the government its absolute majority, but still allows Valls to carry out reforms aimed at lifting France out of its economic crisis.

President Francois Hollande's popularity has plunged over failure to cure the nation's high unemployment rate, zero growth and oversized deficit. 

He had promised to create jobs for the French when he took office in 2012 after defeating the conservative incumbent, Nicolas Sarkozy.

'He had also gradually forged the image of a wise man who stayed on the edge of the river and who only made comments every now and then,' Mr Perrineau added.

'But if he becomes UMP president, he will be asked for his opinion on everything every morning. There is a risk he will be worn down,' he said.

While his supporters are desperate for Sarkozy to return to politics, the wider French population doesn't really care.

A poll released on Tuesday by OpinionWay found that 64 per cent of French people are not interested in his upcoming comeback announcement.

Sarkozy's main rival for the nomination of his right-wing UMP party to run for president is former French prime minister Alain Juppe.

He was found guilty in connection with a separate corruption scandal seven years ago and handed a 14-month suspended prison sentence and banned from holding public office for two years, then went on to be foreign minister after the ban expired.
