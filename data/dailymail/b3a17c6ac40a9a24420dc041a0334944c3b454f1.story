A computer hacking gang caused major companies like PayPal and Visa multi-million pound losses with a series of cyber attacks, a court heard.

Four members of cyber group Anonymous targeted famous firms with a string of coordinated attacks, causing chaos by flooding them with messages and requests, it is alleged.

They are said to have used a Russian-based service provider to carry out the attacks, which permitted 'anything, even CP, child 
pornography’, Southwark Crown Court heard.

Accused: Ashley Rhodes

Accused: Peter Gibson

Christopher Weatherhead

Under the banner Operation Payback, Anonymous are accused of targeting companies who opposed internet piracy
but later attacked PayPal after it refused to process WikiLeaks 
payments.

Their actions caused losses totaling £3.5 million at PayPal, while sites belonging to Mastercard and recording industry bodies were also forced offline.

Prosecutor Samit Patel said the case showed the 'dark side of the internet'.

Anyone who tried to visit the sites was directed to a webpage displaying the message ‘You’ve tried to bite the Anonymous hand. You angered the hive and now you are being stung’.

Four men accused of launching cyber attacks against major companies are said to have targeted PayPal after it refused to process payments from Julian Assange's Wikileaks.

Christopher Weatherhead, 22, of Holly Road, Northampton, is on trial accused of playing an ‘integral role’ in the attacks, while Ashley Rhodes, 28, of Bolton Crescent, Camberwell, south London, Peter Gibson, 24, of Castletown Road, Hartlepool, and an 18-year-old, who cannot be named, have already admitted their roles in the conspiracy.

Jurors heard Weatherhead, who used the online handle ‘Nerdo’, told others ‘I think we should do something really bad’ in the run-up to the hacking campaign.

‘This case, simply put, is about hackers who used the internet to attack and disable computer systems, colloquially described as cyber-attackers or vandals,’ said Mr Patel.

‘It is the prosecution case Christopher Weatherhead, the defendant, is a cyber-attacker, and that he, and others like him, waged a sophisticated and orchestrated campaign of online attacks that paralysed a series of targeted computer systems belonging to companies, to which they took issue with for whatever reason, that caused unprecedented harm.'

The Northampton University student and his three co-conspirators carried out distributed denial of services attacks (DDoS) against the companies, he added.

DDoS attacks work cripples computer systems by flooding them with an ‘intolerable number of online requests and messages'.

A gang alleged to have launched cyber attacks against record labels are also said to have discussed infecting the website of pop star Lily Allen

‘The members of Anonymous describe themselves as hacktivists, it’s a sort of play on words,’ said Mr Patel.

‘They conducted online attacks against computer systems which they took the view, for whatever reason, needed to be dealt with, taught a lesson.

‘Their method was to carry out DDoS attacks in order to bring them down.’

Mr Patel said the gang believed everything on the internet should be free with no copyright protection.

The court heard PayPal was attacked after it decided not to process payments on behalf of the Wau Holland Foundation, an organisation involved in raising funds for WikiLeaks.

He suggested they should 'reap”, thought to mean 'rape', Paypal, using a free internet tool called Low Orbit Ion Canon (LOIC) as a ‘destructive cyber weapon’, it is claimed.

Mr Patel said: ‘Once downloaded the LOIC could be used to attack by sending internet traffic to a target computer.

‘When the volume of traffic sent to a computer becomes too much for it to handle it would suffer a denial of service.

Companies PayPal and Ministry of Sound were among those targeted by an alleged gang of cyber hackers

‘The more LOICs used, therefore, to attack a target computer, the more likely that a denial of service will take place.’

He said the LOIC was used in connection with an online chat system, called AnonOps, to allow Weatherhead and other hackers to order several computers or ‘bots’ to attack simultaneously.

Mr Patel said the attack on PayPal took place between December 8 and 17 and it took more than 100 staff, from its parent company eBay, had to repair it.

Record firm The BPI was targeted on September 19 and 20 2010, leading it to have to pay out £3,996 for online security in the aftermath, plus hundreds of pounds in other costs.

The court heard the four websites run by the Ministry of Sound that were targeted in early October 2010 cost the company about £9,000, while it is alleged the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) was attacked between September 19 and 20, 2010, though the DDoS did not shut the site down.

The financial cost to the IFPI was even greater, with more than £20,000 lost as its website was down for nine days after hacked in November 2010.

Weatherhead allegedly bought a website - anonops.net - for Anonymous to use from a Russian based service provider he claimed to know ‘permitted anything, even CP, child pornography’.

Police swooped on Weatherhead's student home on January 27, and seized his computers, while the 18-year-old who cannot be named; Rhodes and Gibson were also held.

Mr Patel said the 18-year stated online, Iin this network I'm the second most anon. Nerdo is the first', and described him as an administrator.

Rhodes, known as NikonElite, also operated as an administrator.

The prosecutor said: 'He was undoubtedly actively involved in Operation Payback.'

Gibson, whose nickname was Peter, was involved in the administration and maintenance of an IRC server that was 'used as a forum for conspiratorial discussions for attacks which could and did take place'.

The trial continues.
