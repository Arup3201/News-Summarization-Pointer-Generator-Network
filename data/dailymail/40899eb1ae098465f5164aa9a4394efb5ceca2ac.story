David Miliband's suitability to run a human rights charity in America has been brought into question because of his record in hushing up torture

Concern was growing in America yesterday over David Miliband’s suitability to run a human rights charity given his track record in hushing up torture.

His past involvement in covering up the dark practice threatens to tarnish the reputation of the International Rescue Committee, its supporters warned.

Some donors to the highly regarded humanitarian charity are now openly questioning whether he is the right man to be its president.

They are demanding he clear the air by returning to London to give evidence to a judge-led inquiry. 

Mr Miliband, who landed the £300,000-a-year job last year after quitting British politics, has always denied suppressing evidence of torture. In 2010, however, he spent £213,000 of taxpayers’ money in legal fees battling in the Court of Appeal to stop details emerging of the appalling treatment of Binyam Mohamed, the British resident and former Guantanamo inmate.

Now his role in the cover-up is coming under renewed scrutiny following the appalling torture revelations by the US Senate committee.

Dr Aaron Spital, a retired kidney specialist who, according to the charity’s website, donated between $5,000 (£3,100) and $10,000 to the IRC last year, said he would be ‘very surprised’ if, as foreign secretary, Mr Miliband had not known what was going on.

The 63-year-old professor at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York said: ‘The question really comes down to: did David Miliband know there was, what I would consider, torture being used? If he knew about that, if he had anything to do with it, I think that’s an important issue.

‘Maybe somebody who knows something about that, and doesn’t say anything, should give some justification as to why they kept quiet. And if they can’t, it makes you wonder if they should be leading an organisation like the IRC.’

Jerrold Spady, another $5,000-$10,000 donor, said that it was an ‘ethical’ organisation and he did not want anything to tarnish that.

The 78-year-old, from Ulysses in Kansas, said: ‘Being forthcoming is best. I certainly wouldn’t want anything to harm the IRC because they do good work helping some of the poorest people in the world.’

Asked if Mr Miliband should return to the UK to give evidence before Parliament, Eleanora Worth, 81, who lives in Virginia and has donated a similar amount, said: ‘Yes, I agree.’

The IRC, founded at the request of Albert Einstein in 1933, helps refugees from 40 countries including Syria, Afghanistan and Haiti.

Its directors and ‘overseers’ include Henry Kissinger, former UN chief Kofi Annan and Princess Firyal of Jordan.

Working from an office in Manhattan, Mr Miliband earns more than Barack Obama and counts former president Bill Clinton among his friends.

David Miliband also secretly plotted to hand Shaker Aamer to the Saudi Arabian authorities while leading his family to believe he was seeking to bring him back to the UK 

Last month, he was schmoozing with singer Sting and Star Trek actor Sir Patrick Stewart at a gala dinner at the Waldorf Astoria.

In the US, he is called Mr Secretary, following the American custom of using his old title as foreign secretary, but he has spoken of enjoying being relatively ‘anonymous’ in New York compared with his high profile in the UK.

The IRC’s funding comes mainly from taxpayers – including £110million of British aid money – in the form of grants to fund its international relief programmes.

Speaking in advance of the Senate committee’s findings on the CIA, Mr Miliband said torture was ‘reprehensible’.

He claims that he ‘wasn’t suppressing anything’, but he has also acknowledged for the first time the possibility that the US misled British ministers.
