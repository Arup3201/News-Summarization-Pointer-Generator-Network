Graeme McDowell was left to rue a poor finish despite setting the clubhouse target in the first round of the WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai on Thursday.

McDowell played his first 12 holes in seven under par at Sheshan International but dropped two shots in the last six to card an opening 67 in the second event of the European Tour's Final Series.

Starting from the 10th, the Ryder Cup star birdied his opening hole and picked up further shots on the 13th, 14th, 16th and 17th to race to the turn in 31, before birdies at the second and third took him well clear of a star-studded field featuring 40 of the world's top 50.

However, the former US Open champion dropped his first shot of the day on the fourth and paid the price for missing his only fairway of the round on the 603-yard eighth hole, a par-five which had so far given up just two birdies.

At five under par, McDowell enjoyed a two-shot lead over Ryder Cup opponent Rickie Fowler and fellow American Chris Kirk, who were approaching the end of their rounds, with Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter safely in the clubhouse on two under.

American Dustin Johnson claimed the title 12 months ago with a winning total of 24 under par, but Justin Rose - who was fifth last year - had correctly predicted heavier rough and firmer greens would make scoring more difficult.

Rose, who was fourth in the BMW Masters on Sunday, was level par after 13 holes, while the winner at Lake Malaren - Germany's Marcel Siem - was one over with three to play.

Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez, who took 13 on the ninth hole during his final round last week, struggled to an opening 78, while FedEx Cup winner Billy Horschel managed just one birdie in a round of 80. 

Fowler and Kirk duly completed rounds of 69 and were soon joined on three under by the likes of Brandt Snedeker, Tim Clark, 2011 winner Martin Kaymer and England's Tommy Fleetwood.

Henrik Stenson looked set to expand that group still further but twice found sand on the ninth - his final hole - and almost thinned his third shot across the green and into the water.

The resulting bogey left Stenson alongside Westwood and Poulter on two under, with world number two Adam Scott also completing an opening round of 70.
