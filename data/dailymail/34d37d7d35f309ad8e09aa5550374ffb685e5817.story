Along the Turkish border hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees listen to the distant pop of shells and rattle of machine-gun fire as ISIS renewed its attacks on their home city of Kobani today.

Between 140,000 and 180,000 ethnic Kurds have so far left the city for the safety of Turkey, fearing another massacre if Islamic State militants overrun the peshmerga fighters protecting them.

While the evacuation has been largely peaceful so far, today clashes erupted between armed Turkish police and Kurdish refugees as they tried to march back to the border and stage a protest, no longer able to bear  the sound of the fighting.

Tension: Turkish police use tear gas to disperse 200 Kurdish protesters marching towards Syrian border to protest against attacks by the Islamic State

Heavy armour: Soldiers sat nearby watching the protests while carrying riot shields, rifles and wearing gas masks as tension rise along the border

Fleeing: Between 140,000 and 160,000 Kurdish refugees have fled the town of Kobani fearing a massacre if ISIS fighters defeat the peshmerga soldiers defending them

Protest: Kurdish activists had attempted to get to the border to protest against attacks by Islamic State after listening to days of fighting in their home city nearby

Guards in body-armour and helmets were forced to use tear gas to drive a group of around 200 desperate demonstrators back behind Turkish lines.

There has been a heavily military presence along the Turkish side of border all week, including tanks, armoured vehicles and soldiers carrying machine guns as they attempt to keep the peace.

There have also been fears that Kurdish extremists, who have previously staged attacks on the country while demanding their own state, might use the refugee crisis as cover to cross the border. 

Kobani and the surrounding area has been under attack by militants since mid-September as fighters seized surrounding villages, while the city itself has been shelled for the last three days.  

Fighting: Clashes broke out along the Syrian border today where tensions have been rising following days of ISIS attacks on the Kurdish town of Kobani

Crowd control: A Turkish Gendarmerie fires tear gas towards 200 activists who attempted to gather along the border with Syria today

Clashes: Turkish officials have previously said they fear Kurdish militants, who have previously staged attacks against their country, will use the refugee crisis as a reason to cross the border before launching fresh assaults

Desperation: Elderly Kurds walk though clouds of tear gas near the Syrian border today after staging protests against ISIS attacks on their hometown

Fierce: There have been clashes in Kobani since mid-September as fighters from the Islamic State try to capture the last crossing point along Syria's border with Turkey

Senior Kurdish official Asya Abdullah said: 'Clashes continue now, they are shelling on all three fronts. They tried to invade Kobani last night but they were repelled. We think they are planning to launch another big attack but [we are] prepared to resist them.' 

Nawaf Khalil, a spokesman for Syria's leading Kurdish Democratic Union Party, said the militants had failed to capture a strategic hill overlooking the city despite launching five attacks on it.

He added that U.S.-led airstrikes were having 'a positive impact' after a bombing raid on Friday killed an estimated five militants and destroyed one vehicle heading to attack.

Elsewhere today another 30 ISIS fighters were reported to have been killed after airstrikes on the eastern city of Shaddadeh where the Islamist group have a strong foothold. 

Airstrikes: As clashes erupted along the border today, five ISIS fighters were reported to have been killed in a U.S. bombing raid near Kobani overnight on Friday

Resistance: Kurdish forces inside Kobani say they are ready to resist ISIS forces, claiming that the Islamists have failed to capture a strategic hill overlooking the city

New arrival: A confused-looking Kurdish man crosses the police line along the Turkish border after fleeing the ISIS attacks on nearby Kobani

Lookout: A Turkish soldier keeps watch for ISIS forces which can be heard fighting to capture the town of Kobani just a short distance away from the border

Conflict: Turkey has  been reluctant to become involved with the situation in Iraq and Syria but is slowly being dragged into the war as refugees pour across the border

It was the first time Shaddadeh was struck since the U.S.-led campaign began nearly two weeks ago. There was no immediate confirmation on the strikes or casualties from Washington.

About 30 explosions were heard in and near Shaddadeh on Friday night, according to an activist in Hassakeh province, who added that the targets included several buildings occupied by Islamic State fighters. 

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists around Syria, said as many as 30 fighters from the Islamic State group were killed in the airstrikes on Shaddadeh. It said all the dead were foreign fighters. 

Shelling: Sources inside Kobani have reported that ISIS are using heavy weapons to attack on three fronts today, the third day the city has been shelled

Explosion: Kurdish fighters say the main focus of the shelling has been the southwest edge of the city, as they prepare to repel any Islamic State advance

Looking on: Turkish police and troops sit on top of an armoured personnel carrier as the sound of clashes between Kurdish and ISIS forces can be heard

Guarding: Turkey has maintained a strong military presence along the border for the last few weeks as the conflict with ISIS draws closer to its borders

Death toll: Five militants were killed and one vehicle destroyed in the area surrounding Kobani overnight on Friday in a U.S airstrike

Meanwhile in the Syrian capital of Damascus, Bashar al-Assad was seen in a rare public appearance as he joined in Eid al-Adha at the al-Numan Bin Bashir mosque. 

During Syria's civil war, which is now in its fourth year and which activists say has killed more than 190,000 people, Assad has been largely sheltered from the public eye.

The last time he was seen in public was in July, when he attended prayers for the Eid al-Fitr holiday, which marks the end of fasting during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

Desperate: As the number of refugees at Turkey's border grows, another 30 militants were reported to have been killed in the east of Syria in a U.S.-led strike

Helpless: A Kurdish boy looks on through a barbed wire fence after fleeing Kobani where ISIS have renewed their attacks today by shelling parts of the city
