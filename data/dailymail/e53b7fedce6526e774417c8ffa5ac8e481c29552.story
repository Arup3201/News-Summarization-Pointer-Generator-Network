An £8million cinema and leisure complex residents of a market town campaigned to get built is to be completely dismantled six months into the project because it is less than a metre out of place.

The new Cineworld Cinema in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, will be torn down and rebuilt after an embarrassing design error left it too close to existing houses.

Work on the six-screen cinema, known as the Rowley Arts Centre, began at the end of November - six years after residents voted for the leisure facility.

It was due to open in September but this decision, which has been agreed with the Developer Turnstone Estates, will delay completion by four months until next January.

Construction work had already been delayed whilst the contractor Britannia and developers waited for today's decision.

Turnstone had submitted a revised planning application after it came to light that parts of the buildings were being positioned marginally closer to the site's north wall than was planned.

But the application will now be withdrawn and the project rebuilt to accord with the consented scheme.

'We have taken the unprecedented step of halting the existing work and having parts rebuilt to assuage any concerns that adjoining landowners may have,' Chris Goldsmith, of Turnstone, said.

'Although we are only talking about a few centimetres we believe that this is the best solution for all concerned and avoid further delay of these much wanted facilities.

'All involved have acted in a thoroughly open and professional way, for which I am very grateful.'

Blunder: The project has been built out of place and is too close to these houses, so is therefore being constructed without planning consent

Steve Wiener, of Cineworld, said: 'This is unfortunate news but the good news is that we are still on track to opening our cinema in St Neots, albeit now early in the new year.'

Paul Halfpenny, of Britannia Construction, added: 'This situation results from an error in design information provided to us by our lead design consultant.

'This inaccuracy, which was present from the earliest stages of the scheme, sadly wasn't picked up by any members of the client, design or construction teams.

'As soon as the miscalculation was identified we have dealt quickly and efficiently to ensure that our client's instructions are fully complied with, along with our contractual obligations to discharge in accordance with the planning consent.'

Delay: Pulling down the structure, which was started last year, will now not be completed until 2014

Residents and town councillors in St Neots have been campaigning for around 10 years.

In 2006 Peter Rowley, a US-based millionaire with links to the town, donated about £1 million for a leisure facility in St Neots.

Residents were consulted and in 2007 said they favoured a cinema.

The development, which is being built on the site of a former recycling centre, will consist of a six-screen cinema, four restaurants, three flats, a public plaza and parking for cars and bikes.
