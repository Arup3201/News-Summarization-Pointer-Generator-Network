Lost artworks by a British soldier have revealed the lighter side of life in a notoriously grim Japanese Prisoner of War camp.

Lance bombardier Des Bettany, from Burnley, Lancashire, was trapped at Changi Prison in Singapore for three years, where he painted comrades working, bickering and singing in the bath to keep up morale.

He  fashioned a paintbrush out of human hair and bamboo cane, used coloured soil mixed with rice water for paint and scraps of toilet paper were turned into a canvas.

But he hid his experiences from his family and they only discovered them after he died, when his son Keith unearthed dozens of paintings hidden in a wardrobe.

Keeping up morale: Lance bombardier Des Bettany is thought to have painted hundreds of scenes from Changi Prison in Singapore, where he spent three years - including realistic scenes which irked soldiers day-to-day. In this painting, fellow inmates are infuriated as the stinking feet of a soldier attract some unwanted attention

Light-hearted: Senior officers were regular figures of fun, from Captain Ronald Horner who organised the camp's theatre productions rehearsing in the bath to camp policeman Lt Alec Dann acting as 'genie of the lamp'. His son Keith issued an appeal after finding dozens of his works hidden in the back of a wardrobe

Serious: One painting showed the famous Selarang Square incident, where thousands of PoWs stood for five days after refusing to sign a pledge not to escape

The 62-year-old issued an appeal to former inmates of the prison, which held 3,000 PoWs - more than 800 of whom died - and was close to the Selarang Barracks which held another 50,000.

Through the website he established in honour of his father's legacy, he recovered 58 of the paintings which had survived years of detention and seven more decades in the free world.

He believes there are hundreds more of the images which Bettany gave for free to fellow inmates, ranging from poignant depictions of actual scenes to rib-tickling fantasies.

His satirical work poked fun at his Japanese captors and made light of the grim existence the men faced at the notorious jail.

One painting shows a sleeping prisoner whose stinking feet attract mosquitoes to the consternation of his fellow inmates.

Realistic: The images including Cptn Ronald Horner with a camp dog (above) were remarkable considering the brush was fashioned out of an old toothbrush and cane

Hoard: The images ranged from funny to serious, with Lt Dann confiscating an avalanche of watches (left) and Sgt Wilfred Sowter pulling a work trailer by hand (right)

In another, the granddaughter of Sergeant Wilf Sowter uncovered a caricature painting of him waiting for a lavatory to become available while holding two tree leaves as toilet roll.

Another image shows camp policeman Lieutenant Alec Dann confiscating a PoW's frying pan, as rules stated that any cooking had to be shared to stop individuals cooking just for themselves. The work was found by his granddaughter Sabrina Smith.

Serious scenes are depicted too. One painting showed the famous Selarang Square incident, where thousands of PoWs stood for five days after refusing to sign a pledge not to escape.

His works also showed soldiers mining and processing laterite, a soil rich in iron which took back-breaking labour.  

The artist's son said: 'We have been incredibly moved to find that so much of dad's work has been kept by the men he served alongside and their families.

'Every time I look at my emails I get excited because often it is news of another one of dad's missing images.

Optimistic: The back-breaking task of mining and hand-grinding laterite was depicted in an almost cartoonish fashion to keep up morale. Hundreds died in the prison

Arduous: The long march to Changi. Bettany was a Dunkirk veteran who then fought in Singapore, which was captured by the Japanese in 1942. He later emigrated

'It is very heartwarming that his work is still being discovered. I guess this is his legacy that is coming to light all these years later.'

Bettany was a Dunkirk veteran who then fought in Singapore, which was captured by the Japanese in 1942.

After the war he married his wife Irene and they had three children, Graham, Keith and Ruth.

The family emigrated to Australia in 1958 and Des worked at the South Australian School of Art in Adelaide. He died aged 81 in 2000 and Irene died in 2003 aged 88.

Keith, who now lives in Adelaide, Australia, said: 'We don't know how many paintings he gave away. His political cartoons of the Japanese were seized and he gave away complete sketch books as well as single paintings.

'I would estimate that he would have done at least a further 300 paintings if not more.

Portraits: The lance bombardier's artwork included profiles of Lt Alec Dann, the camp policeman (left) and Captain Ronald Horner (right), both of whom he served with

His son said of the artist (pictured): 'It is very heartwarming that his work is still being discovered. I guess this is his legacy that is coming to light all these years later'

'Dad had the natural ability to very quickly draw cartoons. Interestingly, the only time after the war that he drew cartoons were on his home made birthday cards, anniversary cards, Christmas cards to us children and grandchildren.

'When he passed away we found a stack of completed canvases, unframed about one foot to two feet high.

'Since the website has been going we have had 58 images returned. People have have scanned them in and emailed them to me.

'Dad gave it to these men for a reason so it is right the originals remain with their families.'
