Massachusetts U.S. Representative Edward Markey says he will run for John Kerry's Senate seat if Kerry is confirmed as the nation's new secretary of state.

Markey is a Democrat from Malden, just north of Boston, and is the dean of the state's congressional delegation.

He announced his decision on Thursday.

Latest contender: Massachusetts Rep. Edward Markey says he will run for John Kerry's Senate seat if Kerry is confirmed as the nation's new secretary of state

Moving on: Senator Kerry is expected to be confirmed by his fellow senators as secretary of state and would have to leave the Senate to fill that role

Markey says recent events including Superstorm Sandy, the Connecticut school shooting and the fiscal cliff debate have made it clear that Massachusetts needs a senator with the ‘right priorities and values.’

Senator Kerry is expected to be confirmed by his fellow senators as secretary of state. The Democrat would have to leave the Senate to fill that role.

The field of candidates in the special election for Kerry's senate seat likely would be crowded, especially among Democrats, who have no clear front-runner.

Vicki Kennedy is one of the other big names being thrown around as a possible candidate, according to the Boston Herald.

Game changer? Vicki Kennedy, wife of former Senator Edward Kennedy, has indicated that she does not want to run for office, but that a request from the President could change that

Senator Scott Brown would be the Republican favorite if he decided to run.

President Barack Obama is pressuring local democrats to make sure Senator Brown does not win, one top Massachusetts democrat told the Herald. That includes asking Kennedy to reconsider a run.

The second wife of late U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy has already indicated that she does not want to run for office, but that a request from the President could change that.

Two other big contenders, Edward M. Kennedy Jr. and actor Ben Affleck, made it clear on Monday that they are not running.
