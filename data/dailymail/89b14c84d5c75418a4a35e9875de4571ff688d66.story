Move aside Grandpa Munster, there’s a new coffin car in town – and it’s powered by a jet engine. 

Oregon inventor Robert Maddox gave the Dragula coffin car - made famous in the 1960s children’s TV show The Munsters - a 21st century facelift by adding two pulse jets. 

The engine in the Maddoxjets Coffin Car weighs 300lbs and can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in nine seconds – faster than a Toyota Prius.

The Coffin Car, pictured, was created by pulsejet expert Robert Maddox. It is made of wood and the undercarriage consists of steel tubing with a Maddoxjets Thrust Super Dragon Pulsejet Engine under the seat. During tests, Maddox reached speeds of 60mph but doesn't 'dare' go faster

A pulsejet engine is a type of engine in which the combustion happens in loud pulses and is fired by jets.

They can be made with few or no moving parts and can ignite a mixture of air with the majority of fuels available.   

Pulsejets are more commonly used in drones, for flying control line and 
radio-controlled aircraft as well as industrial drying and home heating 
equipment. 

The engines convert fuel into heat, making them perfect for boilers, for example. 

Boeing
 has a proprietary pulse jet engine technology called Pulse Ejector 
Thrust Augmentor (PETA), and plans to use pulse jet engines to lift 
military and commercial aircraft vertically from a standing position. 

Maddox specialises in creating vehicles powered by pulsejet engines, and sells plans to his designs as well parts on his website. 

Previous inventions include the Acme jet skateboard and the jet-powered Cyclone 50 bicycle.

‘It’s definitely the only jet-powered coffin car in the world, powered by pulse jets – I’ve never seen another one like it,’ explained Maddox.

He added he drove the car up to 60mph but didn't 'dare' to go faster, admitting he had trouble breathing when driving it.

The coffin is made of wood, the undercarriage is steel tubing with a Maddoxjets Thrust Super Dragon Pulsejet Engine that has been bent to go under the seat.

The front end 
is a 34 Ford drop axle and the coffin has a five gallon air tank.

While the cockpit features three switches; 
the left-hand switch turns the spark air on and the other two switches 
control the ‘snake venom’ fuel that powers the engines.

'I remembered seeing a schematic of a pulsejet in an encyclopedia when I was a teenager and that is where I started, but there wasn’t anyone to copy so I ended up re-inventing a lot,' Maddox told MailOnline. 

Maddox designed his coffin car after being inspired by Grandpa Munster's Dragula vehicle, pictured, made famous in the 1960s children's TV show The Munsters

Grandpa Munster, pictured, was played in the TV show by Al Lewis. The original model of the Dragula, pictured, featured a 350 horsepower, Ford Mustang V8 engine

He continued he had been fascinated by the possibility of creating a coffin car since he was a child: 'I actually grew up on top of old graveyard hill in Phoenix, Oregon and had graves right under by bed.

'The old cemetery was supposed to have been moved to the new cemetery in 1900, but back then if there were no living kin they would just move the head stone not the coffin. When I was little my Dad dug a swimming pool and hit four graves.'

'I always loved The Munsters, Addams Family and Halloween - naturally since I was known as the kid that lived on graveyard hill - and always wanted a coffin car like Grandpa Munster built.'

Maddox's coffin car took a month to build and cost $1,300 (£814).

The coffin car can go from 0 to 60 in nine seconds. Maddox, pictured, said he didn't 'dare' to go faster than,  admitting he had trouble breathing while driving it but added it was 'way fun'

The Maddoxjets Coffin Car is reminiscent of the Drag-u-la which, along with The Munster Koach, were the main vehicles used by The Munsters. The original model featured a 350 horsepower, Ford Mustang V8 engine.
