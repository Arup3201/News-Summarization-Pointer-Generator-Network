Barack Obama’s annual vacation in Hawaii this year is likely to be his most expensive ever - and the majority of it is being funded by the taxpayer.

The President will travel separately to his family this time because he wants resolve the payroll tax cut issue before leaving Washington D.C.

First Lady Michelle took their children this weekend in a flight that cost an extra $100,000 - and her husband’s round-trip journey will be $3,271,611.

Fun in the sun: President Barack Obama relaxes with the family in Hawaii during a previous holiday. This year's trip is likely to be his most expensive ever

The bill for the trip went up last 
week when Mrs Obama decided to take Sasha and Malia herself while her 
husband tries to save the U.S. economy.

His flight was estimated by the Hawaii
 Reporter as the largest expense of the holiday trip, which will cost 
more than $4million in total.

The U.S. Air Force calculates it costs $181,757 per flight hour to operate Air Force One.

Travel time direct from Washington D.C. to Hawaii is about nine hours, which gives a total of $3,271,611 there and back.

It is thought the accommodation costs run to $151,200.

President Obama's family covers the 
cost of a private beach front residence in Kailua, Oahu, for the 
holiday, which costs up to $3,500 a day, or $75,000 a month.

But
 taxpayers take care of housing for Secret Service, Coast Guard and Navy
 Seals who guard the rentals and arrive a day ahead of Mr Obama.

That is about $21,600 per home for approximately seven houses rented for 18 days. There is also a hotel bill for $72,216.

TRAVEL: $3,629,622

HOUSING: $151,200

HOTEL: $72,216

LOCAL TAXPAYER: $260,000

Excluding
 tax, meals and other charges at the more conservative rate, that 
amounts to more than $72,216 for approximately 24 members of staff.

Then there's the local taxpayer costs of $260,000. The overtime for local police in Oahu is expected to cost taxpayers $250,000.

A city spokesman said an ambulance that travels with the president at all hours will cost an additional $10,000.

Several costs are unknown and will not be released by the White House, citing security reasons.

Some include security upgrades, 
additional phone lines, bullet proof glass, car rentals, fuel, travel 
costs for staff travelling ahead of the President.

The estimated cost for a 17-day round trip for a Hawaii holiday for the President, his family, staff and security is $4,113,038.

A spokesman for the White House told the Hawaii Reporter that the costs are 'in line' with other presidential vacations.

Commitment: Obama will miss the start of the annual 
holiday to his birthplace in order to fix the budget crisis. It is unknown when 
he will be able to join the family

It is not yet known when President Obama will fly out to Hawaii, with the death of North Korea's leader Kim Jong-Il likely to delay his trip further.

Michelle, Sasha and Malia Obama all arrived in Hawaii at the weekend and spent their first night there on Saturday. Friends joined them soon after.

President Obama has been told of the North Korean leader's death but is also locked in a payroll taxes showdown with Republicans.

He has called close friend President Lee Myung-Bak of South Korea to discuss any potential implications of the death, reported AFP.

Extending the payroll tax cut and jobless benefits have been a keystone of President Obama's effort to spur a revival of the flaccid economy.

But many Republicans believe the unemployment coverage is too generous and that cutting the payroll tax does not create jobs.
