Court: Adlene Hicheur

A nuclear scientist has gone on trial for allegedly plotting terror attacks with the North Africa wing of al Qaeda.

Magistrates investigating the case 
said the emails Adlene Hicheur exchanged with suspected Islamists 'crossed the line of simple debate of political or
religious ideas to enter the sphere of terrorist violence'.

However his lawyers told the court that while their client had sent angry emails he never took any steps towards committing an attack. They said there is no proof of any terrorist intentions.

Hicheur is accused of plotting an explosion that would have destroyed 'a city the size of London' and has gone on trial in Paris today.

He is also alleged to have compiled a 'hit list' of VIP targets including French president Nicolas Sarkozy and his former interior minister Brice Hortefeux.

The 35-year-old French-Algerian was arrested in a joint MI5 and French intelligence sting three years ago while researching the Big Bang theory at the CERN nuclear laboratory near Geneva.

He denies the accusations and told the court that the investigation had been dishonest and imprecise.

In one email to suspected Islamic terror chief Mustapha Debchi, Hicheur said he would 'propose possible objectives in Europe and particularly in France'.

He wrote in March 2009: 'Concerning the matter of objectives, they differ depending on the different results sought after the hits.

'For example: if it's about punishing the state because of its military activities in Muslim countries - Afghanistan - then it should be a purely military objective. For example: the air base at Karan Jefrier near Annecy in France. This base trains troops and sends them to Afghanistan.'

In June 2009, Debchi asked Hicheur: 'Don't beat around the bush: are you prepared to work in a unit becoming active in France?'

Hicheur replied: 'Concerning your proposal, the answer is of course yes but there are a few observations. If your proposal relates to a precise strategy - such as working in the heart of the main enemy's house and emptying its blood of strength - then I should revise the plan that I've prepared.'

At CERN - the European Organisation for Nuclear Research - Hicheur worked on the Large Hadron Collider, a device designed to recreate the conditions of the Big Bang.

In 2001 he worked at Stanford University in California and by 2005 had moved to the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire.

Hicheur's lawyer now fears his trial for 'criminal association as part of a terrorist enterprise' could be jeopardised by the seven murders committed by Toulouse terrorist Mohamed Merah this month.

Patrick Baudouin said: 'There is not the least proof against Mr Hicheur of any terrrorist intention.

'He has since the beginning been painted as the ideal guilty party. When the justice system gets going it finds it difficult to admit its mistakes.

'And with the murders in Toulouse this month committed by a suspected Islamic terrorist, this is not the ideal time to be holding his trial.'

Hicheur, who denies the charge, faces ten years in prison if convicted.
