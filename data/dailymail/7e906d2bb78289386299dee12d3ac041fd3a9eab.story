We can all be guilty of having eyes bigger than our stomachs at Christmas.

But this robin has a healthier appetite than most.

Perched on the side of a plate and gazing longingly at a Christmas pudding topped with holly, this little bird has been named Bob by grandmother Pat Lowe.

And this is not the first feast the robin has enjoyed in the run-up to Christmas.

He has also tucked into hot bowls of porridge, mealworms and breadcrumbs.

Bob’s visits to the pensioner, from Lydney in Gloucestershire, have become so frequent that on some occasions, he taps at her window 15 times in one day.

The 77-year-old regularly goes outside to feed the birds but on the day that she forgot, the little robin simply let himself in.

Ring ring, chirp chirp: Robin, Mrs Lowe, said isn't scared of anybody or anything: 'The other day, I opened the door for the postman and Bob flew over the postman’s head and came in.

Since the summer, the bird has become a regular visitor to the house that Mrs Lowe shares with her 82-year-old husband Richard.

Mrs Lowe said: ‘I didn’t go out into the garden one day and then he started coming into the house – he thinks I’m his mummy.

She added: ‘He’s not scared of anybody. The other day, I opened the door for the postman and Bob flew over the postman’s head and came in.

‘He loves porridge – I cook it for him to keep him nice and warm for the winter. He’s not eating out of my hand yet, but I’m working on it.’

Robins are territorial and stick to the same spot throughout the seasons and often their whole lives.

They use their song to ward off intruders and were made the UK’s national bird in 1960.
