Police have released video footage of the moment a teenager endangered the lives of a Florida law enforcement helicopter crew by shining a laser light at them.

The clip shows a green laser blinding Alert 2, a Seminole County Sheriff’s Office helicopter, for several seconds.

The teen was then filmed by the helicopter walking around the swimming pool of a residence in Longwood and dashing to the front of the property as the helicopter hovers close by.

Police said the flight crew reported a green laser light flashing through their cockpit on Saturday as they flew at around 800 feet.

Patrol: Footage shows the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office helicopter flying at around 800 feet 

Danger: Then a laser light, circled, flashes several times through the cockpit

Bright: The laser shines several times right into the helicopter's camera

The crew then homed in on the person responsible using Forward Looking Infrared.

They directed deputies on the ground to the residence of suspect Trevor Ragno, 19, and he was arrested outside it.

A police statement said: ‘Shining a light into an aircraft creates a glare on the windscreen and generates a temporary flash of blindness, similar to a camera flash.

Tracked: The police helicopter found the suspect standing by an indoor swimming pool at a house in Longwood

On the run: The suspect, Trevor Ragno, then dashed round the side and out to the front of the residence

‘It is highly dangerous for pilots and flight crew who can experience blurred vision or become disoriented.

‘At the time of Saturday night’s laser strikes, Alert 2 was flying at approximately 800 feet. The FBI Task Force and FAA were also notified of the incident.’

It added: ‘Ragno was transported to the John E. Polk Correctional Facility and charged with a felony for pointing a laser light at a pilot and culpable negligence.

‘He posted the $1,100 bond Sunday morning and was released from the facility.’
