For Scotland, it was desperate, frantic backs-to-the-wall stuff by time up. Gordon Strachan spoke afterwards of feeling drained by a night of heroic graft and he wasn’t alone. This is the kind of night likely to prove the difference between qualification and a perennial hard-luck tale.

They clung on in the end. An engrossing, pulsating Euro 2016 qualifier ended in an excellent, valuable point. Yet with 15 minutes to play the Scots promised so much more. Recovering from a wretched start and the loss of an early goal, they somehow eked out the lead via strikes from Shaun Maloney and Steven Naismith.

The brilliance of Arkadiusz Milik dragged Poland back into it and, but for the width of a goalpost in the dying minutes, this might have been a desperate tale of woe for Strachan’s team. They rode their luck in the final stages. No question.

Yet a home win over Georgia and a return of four points from a possible six was tarnished only by a late Irish equaliser against Germany.

Strachan calls Group D the group of death, but in this developing team life and energy abounds.

There were fine performances all over here. Ikechi Anya – again – Russell Martin, James Morrison, and the unheralded Gordon Greer - a late stand-in for Grant Hanley no less - were simply superb.

‘Gordon Greer was fantastic,’ said the Scotland manager. ‘He looks nothing like a football player - he looks like a rock star who’s turned up at a testimonial game. But he is absolutely fantastic. I thought his partner also did well.’

Steven Whittaker was an unexpected replacement for Andrew Robertson at left back and also earned the praise of his manager.

‘Steven Whittaker? You put him on there and you know what you are going to get,’ said Strachan. ‘If you had 10 Steven Whittakers you would sleep a lot easier the night before the game, trust me. He can’t play in goals, that’s why I only said 10.’

Yet the night got off to a deeply inauspicious start. Backed by a partisan and raucous home support, Poland took the lead in 11 minutes with a goal which was cheap and avoidable. It was also a personal disaster for Alan Hutton.

The Aston Villa right-back earned plaudits for his performance in the weekend win over Georgia, a result which invigorated a campaign that began with defeat in Germany.

Seeking to cut out a speculative, chipped through ball outside his own area, he took a poor touch with the outside of his heel directing the ball straight into the path of Krzysztof Maczynski in a shooting position. The midfielder’s calm, controlled low sidefooted shot rebounded off the inside of the post and into the net.

Hutton sank to his backside on the turf as team-mates looked accusingly in his direction. In the space-age, cavernous environs of Warsaw’s National Stadium it was an ominous development.

A repeat of the friendly victory here in March already looked improbable. But the Scots showed depth and reserves of strength.

Under Strachan they know how to work their way back into a game. And it took them just six minutes to do it.

A fine goal it was, too, the pre-match recovery of Ikechi Anya from an injury scare proving an act of mercy from the footballing gods.

The Watford man conjured a superb first touch from Steven Fletcher’s spearing, diagonal long ball, plucking it out of the air on the left of the area and playing a pinpoint cut back to Maloney 10 yards from goal.

The former Celtic player had scored just twice in 34 international appearances, but showed great poise to steer a low, placed shot into the net. With 17 minutes played, this lively football match stood at 1-1.

The equaliser had a calming effect on Scotland. It settled them. Frankly, they looked the more dangerous team.

In 38 minutes Whittaker more than justified the decision to pick him at Robertson’s expense when he denied the Poles a certain second goal.

Robert Lewandowski, the shining star of this Polish team, looked odds on to convert after Waldemar Sobota ghosted in behind the Scots rearguard and guided Artur Jedrzejczyk’s through ball towards goal.

Whittaker hacked it to safety. Scotland breathed again and made it to half-time intact.

Within 12 minutes of the restart they went a stage further, silencing the 55,197 crowd with a stunning second goal.

Scotland’s set-pieces had been poor of late, so when Maloney was fouled 30 yards from goal the fans were hardly holding their breath in anticipation. But this time James Morrison’s free kick found its way through a static Polish defence, Naismith reacting to prod the ball low into the corner of the net from 10 yards out.

The regret for Scotland was that half an hour of the match still remained.

Inevitably they began to fall deep. Too deep at times. Tiredness played its part, of course.

Milik, the Polish No7, posed the greatest threat of damage. He headed a more than decent opening onto the roof of the net from close range.

With 20 minutes to play his low, driven cross then ran menacingly across the face of Scotland’s goal, requiring the merest of touches to draw the Poles level.

The minutes, by now, were ticking past excruciatingly slowly.

Strachan opted for fresh legs. Darren Fletcher replaced the goalscorer Naismith while Derby’s Chris Martin took Steven Fletcher’s place up front.

And within seconds the Scots came so close to going 3-1 ahead. Anya’s run to the left touchline ended in a piercing deep cross to the back post area where Maloney controlled and lashed a right foot shot towards the top of the net.

Wojciech Szczesny – outstanding against Germany – pushed the ball over the bar at the last second.

Had it gone in it was game over. Scotland would have taken all three points.

But the margins at this level are slim. Strachan’s team were dropping deep. What came next was brutal both in its significance and its creativity.

With 14 minutes to play, Jedrzejczyk played a neat reverse pass in behind the hapless Hutton, Milik thrashing an outstanding left foot shot which fizzed past Marshall’s outstretched hands to scenes of enormous joy and no little Polish relief.

The home nation were working up a head of steam. An impassioned support bayed for the winning goal, demanded it, indeed.

Within minutes they almost had it. Lewandowski worked an opening to thrash a rasping right foot shot towards goal, David Marshall saving brilliantly.

Then came a quite incredible let-off for the visitors six minutes from time.

Milik, a repeated thorn in Scotland’s side, lashed an angled shot against the outside of the post after some delightful lead-up play. The ball fell invitingly to Kamil Grosicki who seemed certain to thrash it into the net before the ball skidded wide.

Polish heads were in hands. They knew, as we all did, that their final chance had come and gone.
