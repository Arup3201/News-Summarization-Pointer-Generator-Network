A British teenager has told how she was seduced by the same Turkish waiter who ran away with a 16-year-old schoolgirl.

Alanah Longshaw, from Stirling in Scotland, told how Murat Can Ertani groomed her via Facebook, told her he loved her and persuaded her to leave her mother and move in with him in Turkey.

But after she fell pregnant with his child when she was just 16, the 22-year-old told her 'I hope you and the baby die in labour'.

British schoolgirl Faye Jones, 16, from Cramlington, Northumberland who has the same dark hair and green eyes as Alanah disappeared four days ago with Can.

But today police contacted her mother Rhonda, 39, to say that she had been found with Can about an hour away from the resort of Marmaris.

Pattern: Alanah Longshaw with her son. She revealed Murat Can Ertani groomed her via Facebook, told her he loved her and persuaded her to leave her mother and move in with him in Turkey

Alanah, who is now 19, fell for him because he told her that she was beautiful and 'not like all the other girls'.

Alanah
 was 16 when she decided to give up her life in Scotland to go and live 
with him and his family in the village of Adana just outside Marmaris in
 January 2011.

She said she 
was so in love with him it didn't bother her that she was sharing a 
cramped dilapidated apartment with his mum, stepdad and brother but he 
had lied to her that he had a job in a tattoo shop when he was in fact a
 jobless criminal.

After a 
few months, the couple decided to move to Marmaris to try to find work 
and get a flat together. It was then her life became unbearable.

They
 were unable to find a job and were living in squalor in a flat without 
electricity or any amenities she was used to at home.

Distraught: Faye's mother Rhonda has been frantically searching for her. But today police contacted her to say that she had been found

She told the Scottish Daily Record: 
'Things were great at first but when we moved in together he was a 
different person. He became violent and aggressive and he was drinking 
all the time.

'He would lock me in the apartment 
for hours on end while he went out to get drunk and then he’d come home 
and attack me. He would slap me and called me names like slut.'

She said that after a while she persuaded Can to return to live with his mother bur she fled and booked a flight home.

Back in Britain she went to college to study travel and tourism in a bid to realise her dream of becoming a travel rep.

But she was forced to quit college after she found out she was five months pregnant with Can's child.

When
 Alanah told him she was carrying his baby, she says he was happy 
initially but then he turned, sending her sickening Facebook messages.

She told the newspaper: 'I was 
horrified when I received a message from him saying, "I hope that you 
both die in labour". What kind of person would say something like that?'

Turkish police say Murat Can Ertani is a criminal and has spent time in jail

Search: More than 30 Turkish police officers were said to have been on the case and the family put missing person posters up around the resort

Fall out: Faye's mother said she had to go home after an incident in which Can allegedly slapped one of her friends in a bar

Frantic: Miss Jones, pictured with Faye, said she has been searching the resort day and night

Faye
 arrived in Marmaris on June 27 with her mother to visit her grandmother
 Jackie Armstrong, 68.

The teenager had met Can last year and had 
secretly kept in touch via Facebook and on Skype.

Faye’s
 mother banned her from seeing the barman last week after he erupted 
into a jealous rage during a night out.

She said that Can had ordered 
Faye to stop dancing.

Police
 spotted the runaways in the town’s bazaar, but they 
escaped, dumping the suitcase which contained her money and passport.

Today police contacted Faye's mother Rhonda, 39,
 to say that she had been found with Can about an hour away from the 
resort - the pair had been on holiday in the resort when she 
disappeared. 

They are now hoping to reunite the teenager with her mother, but it is unclear if she is willing to come back to her home in Cramlington, 
Northumberland. 

It is believed the pair are being held in the juvenile section of a police station in a large Turkish town.

Today Faye's cousin, Stacey 
Lithgow, 25, today said: 'My sister sent me a text saying Faye has been 
found. I am going over to her house to speak to people in Turkey now.

'I can't explain how relieved I am. It is great news.' 

A Facebook page, committed to finding 
the teenager, said: 'It is with great pleasure I can say that Faye Jones
 has been found. Police have her but she has not yet been reunited with 
Rhonda. I would like to thank you all for your help and support during 
this time.'
