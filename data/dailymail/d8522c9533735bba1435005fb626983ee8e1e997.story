Highly regarded Australian architect Peter Stuchbury has continued to soar after receiving the Australia Institute of Architects highest honour, the highly coveted Gold Medal for Architecture.

He earned the prestigious award for his considerable contribution to the advancement of architecture though practice, teaching and participation.

While you may imagine the award winning 60-year-old's own home to be a lavish contemporary monument, you'll be surprised to know that in reality Mr Stuchbury didn't opt for an opulent structure but instead a simple and sustainable tent on Sydney's northern beaches.

His own home, which he presented to the NSW Architecture Awards jury, is a humble 45-square-metre tent house which he said is 'designed to challenge the conventions of our suburban lives.'

'The tent house provides a model for sustainability. It is a purposeful step towards a radical view of living in the suburbs,' Mr Stutchbury told jurors.

'It is a necessary step towards reduction if we as a community are to rediscover a sustainable lifestyle.'

Unlike some lavish small homes that are heavily styled Mr Stutchbury instead chose simplicity preferring to decorate his home modestly.

His bedroom opens out onto a wooden deck and only houses a bed, a chest of drawers, a rack of clothing and a rocking chair.

The home is saturated in a warm glow as the light entering the home is filtered through canvas walls.

Mr Stutchbury has garnered a reputation for his environmentally sustainable residential structures which have been internationally recognised to have an intrinsic link to the site they are built on.

'Stutchbury has mastered the art of creating architecture that speaks of the place it inhabits – buildings that are environmentally sustainable, culturally specific and locally embedded'

'In 34 years of practice, Stutchbury has mastered the art of creating architecture that speaks of the place it inhabits – buildings that are environmentally sustainable, culturally specific and locally embedded,' said the Gold Medal jury.

His firm, Peter Stutchbury Architecture, has received 47 institution awards and have been entered into around 20 national and international design competitions.

He is best known for his work on Bay and Springwater house which took out the country's top architectural honour, the Robin Boyd Award, in 2003 and 2005 respectively.

As a founding director of the Architecture Foundation Australia Mr Stutchbury continues to pass on his message of creating a more sustainable built environment by teaching students of Glenn Murcutt International Architecture Master Class and those at the University of Newcastle.

Professor Stutchbury said winning a prestigious award like this has been very 'humbling' and 'a deep honour' adding that he found himself 'speechless' after realising he had joined the ranks of architecture greats who had also won the accolade.
