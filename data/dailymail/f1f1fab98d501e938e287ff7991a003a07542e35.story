A brave mother-of-five has told how needing 1,000 stitches to horrific injuries suffered in the catastrophic blast at a Texas fertilizer plant is 'another bump in the road' for her.

Positive Misty Lambert, 37, had only moved to West, near Waco, Texas, two weeks before the devastating explosion last Wednesday which killed at least 14 and injured more than 200 others.

She was left in agony suffering cuts to her face, chest and arms caused by flying shards of glass and metal and was knocked to the ground by a falling window.

Bearing the scars: Ms Lambert needed 1,000 stitches after she was caught up in the blast near her home in West, Texas

Ms Lambert was trapped in her apartment close to the West Fertilizer Co. plant for an hour before she was rescued by emergency crews.

She has been left with scars all over her face and body.

She told KWTX-TV: 'It's another bump in the road for me. I'm saddened by the fact that people lost their lives, but I'm grateful that I still have my life.'

Emergency crews worked frantically in the wake of the explosion to find survivors in West, much of which was flattened by the blast.

Among the dead are six firefighters and four paramedics.

Ms Lambert says that she was in the bedroom of her apartment when she spotted the factory on fire.

Worrying that the fire might spread or the factory explode, Ms Lambert told her four-year-old son Nikoda and two of her nephews to leave the room and head to door.

She grabbed her keys and her phone and was about to flee the flat when she turned back to look out of the window.

She said: The explosion itself, it just came at me.'

State investigators are still working to piece together what caused the fire and subsequent explosion at the plant.

They say that so far there are no signs that there was any criminal intent behind the tragedy.

But it emerged yesterday that the plant last had a full safety inspection almost 30 years ago.

The United States Department of Labor website said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) visited West Chemical and Fertilizer Company in February 1985.

The revelation came amid growing concern about how health and safety rules were followed at the plant, which supplied agricultural chemicals and fertilizer to area farmers.

Back then it fined the company $30 for a serious violation for storage of anhydrous ammonia.

OSHA cited the plant for four other serious violations of respiratory protection standards but did not issue fines. The maximum fine for a serious violation was $1,000.

The agency has jurisdiction over more than 7million workplaces but it is not uncommon for some companies to go years without inspection.

The towns schools reopened on Monday and families of those who died have begun to plan funerals.

But those living closest to the factory have not yet been allowed to return to their homes.

Owner of the factory Donald Adair issued a statement on Friday saying that he would co-operate fully with the investigation into the blast.
