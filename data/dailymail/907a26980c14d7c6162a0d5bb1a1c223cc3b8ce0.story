Chris Ramsey is relishing his role as semi-permanent Queens Park Rangers manager, regardless of the four-point margin between the west London club and 17th place.

Ramsey joined QPR as academy manager after 10 years with Tottenham, and picked up the managerial reins until at least the end of the season after the departure of Harry Redknapp in February.

The former Brighton right back, whose side host Everton on Sunday, found himself out of work for more than half a year after being relieved of his duties in north London at the end of last season, and admits he was desperate to return to the game – irrespective of the circumstances.

‘I had seven months at home watching Frasier, Jeremy Kyle and Homes Under The Hammer!’ said Ramsey. ‘Of course I would rather be here in this situation than be out of work and worrying where the next job or paycheque is going to come from.

‘I'm in a fantastic situation - I'm one of 20 managers in the best league in the world.’

Ramsey has a fight on his hands if QPR are to remain in ‘the best league in the world’, and while no physical confrontation took place, the 52-year-old admitted to a ‘heated exchange’ with his players when 3-0 down at half-time against Crystal Palace a week ago.

However, Ramsey knows simply rollicking his players each week won’t be enough to save QPR’s season.

‘We’ve had some strong words before each game to be honest, and sometimes you have to take a different tact because the effect of that speech goes,’ Ramsey continued. ‘Sometimes you have to look at the game and the situation, and use different strategies to get the players ready to perform.

‘The players didn’t throw the towel in against Palace. We talked about making sure the fans weren’t embarrassed any more in the second half of the game.

‘So Matty (Phillips) scores a goal like he’ll probably never score again. If he shoots from there again I don’t think I’ll be too happy, unless it goes in.’

QPR suffered a 3-1 defeat at the hands of Alan Pardew's Crystal Palace last weekend
