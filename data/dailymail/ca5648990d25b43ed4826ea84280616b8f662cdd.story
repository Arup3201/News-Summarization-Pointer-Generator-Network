A couple scuba diving in a frigid lake found a GoPro camera that had been lost there six months before - and managed to track down its owners and return the footage of their dream road trip.

Allisa Oliger and her husband Mark found the camera, encrusted with mussels, 40ft below the surface of Lake Powell, Utah, while diving there on New Year's day.

The camera, plucked out of the freezing water, had been there for six months, when it was dropped by a group of four friends who had filled the memory card with footage and snaps of their voyage.

Accident: The friends, pictured above recording each other jumping into the lake with GoPros, had taken extensive footage of their voyage - and the rescued camera will add even more

Dan Burkovskiy, who owned the device, had been distraught at losing the footage loaded with images and video of his trip, which took them from Massachusetts to California.

Along the way they took in sights like Niagara Falls, Chicago, Sioux Falls, Mount Rushmore, Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam.

Burkovskiy, a logistics manager from Los Angeles, had been planning the trip for a year with his cousin and two other friends who have known each other since they were teenagers. 

They lost the camera in Lake Powell, another stop on the list, when they capsized their kayaks for fun before heading off.

Burkovskiy said: 'We kayaked around Lake Powell, and my friend decided to be funny and flip the kayaks over just to take that one last dip' - which is when the camera fell out.

He had given it up for lost after it vanished in July, but was overjoyed when the Oligers worked out who he was from the footage and managed to track him down online, Fox31 Denver reported.

Allisa Oliger, who lives in Durango, Colorado, explained her story to the station.

She said: 'I went on YouTube and in the search box I typed in "2014 cross country road trip". When I typed in "Sioux Falls" his was the first video that popped up and I recognized his face immediately.'

She was able to then track Burkovskiy down on Facebook and arrange to mail back the camera.

In a recent post, he wrote: 'I can't wait to uncover and see all the pictures/videos that were lost 6 months ago...'

He told DailyMail.com that the returned camera, which is currently in the postal system, has footage from places like Monument Valley, Utah, that none of his other friends captured. 

He continued: 'It is nice to know that someone so honest and caring would make it their mission to return the camera. I hope you know how much you are appreciated.'
