A myriad of priceless and beautiful objects are debuting this week in the largest scale jewellery exhibition ever staged at Australia's Powerhouse Museum.

'A Fine Possession: Jewellery and Identity' is a major historical and fashion exhibition showcasing fine ornamental pieces which span across millennia and culture.

On display at the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, the stunning selection includes jewellery worn by famous Australian women, including Hollywood giants Cate Blanchett, Nicole Kidman and designer Catherine Martin.

The collection is both ambitious and breathtaking, featuring rare and priceless pieces which cross movements incorporating Art Nouveau, 70's psychedelic, contemporary and ancient Egyptian.

The exhibition will explore themes including belief and magic, love and death, nature and culture, and modernity and change.

Several of the sparkling featured items include a neckpiece worn by Nicole Kidman in Baz Lurmann's iconic film Moulin Rouge, a world-famous diamond brooch worn by Cate Blanchett to the Oscars, and a star-studded ring from world-renowned fashion designer Catherine Martin.

'Helen's Jewels': Helen of Troy painted on canvas by Sir Edward John Pointer in 1881. Pointer depicted Helen (modelled by popular British actress Lillie Langtry) in jewels he imagined were befitting the legendary Queen, whose face was said to have 'launched a thousands ships'

From an ornate Napoleon Bonaparte ring carved in onyx by Italy's Antonio Santorelli around 1800 AD, and unique pieces of Victorian mourning jewellery, to brooches made from a taxidermy mouse and a tiara made from sardine tins, this vast and fascinating collection has something for everyone. 

A fine possession Curator Eva Czernis-Ryl says the exhibition will appeal to anyone with 'an interest in creative jewellery from different periods and cultures, and in objects of intimate beauty that enchant, surprise and stimulate the imagination'.  

The collection highlights over 700 pieces, with rarely seen treasures from the museum's rich decorative arts collection. Dating as far back as 1800 BC with a necklace from 12th Dynasty Ancient Egypt, other highlights include countless weird and wonderful objects including necklaces made from weevils and ear plugs. 

'This exhibition is a fascinating window into our past, exploring some of the earliest days of creative expression, and highlights the importance of our collecting institutions in preserving the material heritage and stories of New South Wales and Australian culture, history and lifestyle,' said Minister for the Arts, Troy Grant. 

Not only are the ornate and intricate pieces available for viewing, but the history behind many of the dazzling items are detailed, asking the question of why the appeal of jewellery remains so timeless and universal.

'This stunning exhibition brings together objects from the Museum’s own rich collection that have rarely or never been seen, alongside prized possessions from a range of private and public collections from Australia and overseas,' said Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences Director, Rose Hiscock.  

A fine possession: Jewellery and identity, runs at the Powerhouse Museum from 24 September 2014 – 20 September 2015.
