Lieutenant Hadar Goldin, who was captured earlier this month. In the aftermath heavy shelling was unleashed on the southern Gaza town of Rafah

The Israeli military has been criticised over using the so-called 'Hannibal procedure' tactic to stop the capture of soldiers, which has killed over 100 Palestinians.

The army has used the procedure, which allows overwhelming fire after soldiers when it is feared militants have captured an officer.

It was allegedly used recently when heavy shelling was unleashed on the southern Gaza town of Rafah after the capture of Lieutenant Hadar Goldin earlier this month.

Now, a group is calling on the military to abandon the practice, saying it puts captured soldiers at unreasonable risk and can lead to civilian deaths.

The Association for Civil Rights in 
Israel, a prominent rights group, has asked the government to strike 
down the doctrine and investigate its use.

In
 a letter to Israel's attorney general they wrote: 'A protocol that puts
 the life of the captured soldier in jeopardy to thwart a kidnapping is 
fundamentally unacceptable.

'Implementing this protocol in 
populated areas, wherein the soldier and his captors are surrounded by a
 civilian population that is not taking part in hostilities, is strictly
 prohibited.'

Israel's Justice Ministry declined to comment, merely saying it received the letter.

New recruits to the Israeli army learn that if they see a soldier being captured and rushed away in a car, they should shoot at the vehicle to stop its progress, even if it risks the soldier's life.

The 'Hannibal Procedure' was designed in the mid-1980s by Yossi Peled, then head of Israel's Northern Command, after Hezbollah guerrillas captured two soldiers in southern Lebanon.

However, its use in the recent conflict has angered critics who say it may have led to the deaths of scores of Palestinians earlier this month, when Israeli soldiers feared militants had captured Lieutenant Goldin.

Hamas fire killed Goldin and two other Israeli soldiers near Rafah, along Gaza's southern border with Egypt, shortly after an internationally brokered cease-fire took effect.

According to Israeli media reports, three bodies were found at the scene shortly after the ambush, but upon closer inspection troops realized that one of them was a Hamas militant disguised in an Israeli uniform â€” raising fears that Hamas had captured Goldin.

The aftermath of Israeli airstrikes in Rafah in southern Gaza after the capture of Lieutenant Hadar Goldin

The shelling earlier this month is said to have killed over 100 Palestinians in Gaza

That's when 'Hannibal' allegedly went 
into effect, with Israel unleashing a massive barrage of airstrikes and 
artillery fire aimed at blocking any potential escape routes of the 
kidnappers.

Defying 
protocol, a fellow officer rushed into one of the tunnels and found some
 personal effects belonging to Goldin that helped the military later 
rule him dead.

The Israeli military would not officially confirm whether the tactic was enacted after Goldin's disappearance, but multiple officials say the rare order was given.

The heavy shelling levelled the area in Rafah, killing some 100 Palestinians, Palestinian health officials say.

A 72-hour ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is set to end at midnight tonight local time

Asa Kasher, a philosophy professor who authored the military's official code of conduct in the 1990s, said the 'Hannibal Procedure' has been grossly misunderstood and strikes a delicate balance between protecting the lives of soldiers and carrying out military responsibilities.

Much of the directive remains classified, but Kasher stressed the conventional wisdom of a 'dead soldier being better than a captive soldier' was a fallacy.

'That is just an awful saying and totally untrue. It goes against every value of the Israeli military', he said.

However,
 Tamar Feldman, an ACRI lawyer, said the practice violates the potential
 captive's human rights. When employed in a crowded area like Gaza, it 
raised even more questions.

Since the latest truce went into effect on Sunday, Israel has halted military operations in the coastal territory and Gaza militants have stopped firing rockets

She said: 'A command that subjugates the life of a soldier to an unknown political gain ... is both cynical and revolting.

'Activating this protocol in the heart of an urban and civilian environment is particularly grave; it shakes the foundations of law and morality and must be absolutely condemned.'

It comes as 72-hour truce between Israel and Hamas is set to expire at midnight local time with negotiators in Cairo trying to thrash out a more permanent ceasefire arrangement.

Since the latest truce went into effect on Monday, Israel has halted military operations in the coastal territory and Gaza militants have stopped firing rockets.
