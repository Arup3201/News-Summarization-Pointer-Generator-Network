Police are investigating after ‘toxic levels of cyanide’ were found in her bloodstream of a well-respected Pennsylvania doctor who died suddenly at her home last month.

Autumn Marie Klein, 41, collapsed at her Oakland, Pennsylvania home and died on April 20 at UPMC Presbyterian, where she also headed the women's neurology department and was an assistant professor of neurology, obstetrics and gynecology. Klein was married to another neurology specialist at UPMC, Robert Ferrante, and had a six-year-old daughter called Cianna.

Pittsburgh Police used search 
warrants and subpoenas to obtain cyanide from the lab where Dr. Ferrante
works on Thursday, reports KDKA .

The body of top neurology expert and married mother-of-one Autumn Marie Klein was found to contain 'toxic levels of cyanide' when she died

Dr. Ferrante is also reported to have
hired prominent attorney, and former U.S. Attorney General J. Alan 
Johnson and a forensic pathologist Cyril H. Wecht.

The medical examiner’s office has issued subpoenas to the University of 
Pittsburgh to find out the movement of chemicals, in and out of the lab,
including cyanide.

Dr. Ferrante called 911 and reported that his wife had a heart attack on April 20th.

Sources say 'extremely high levels of
cyanide' were found in Dr. Klein’s blood. The type of levels that would
have “knocked her to the floor” in 30 seconds sources say.

District Attorney Stephen Zappala told KDKA that they are investigating her death as a possible homicide, or suicide.

Although police sources also say they 
do not believe Dr. Klein committed suicide, she was the mother of a 
six-year-old and reportedly trying to have another child.

Husband Robert Ferrante is also a specialist in neurology at UPMC

Medical Examiner Dr. Karl Williams 
said more tests were needed to determine how Klein died and it may take 
12 to 16 weeks to determine Klein's cause of death.

Cyanide is relatively easy and cheap to generate.

In
addition to pesticide and insecticide, it is contained in tobacco 
smoke, smoke from building fires and some foods, like almonds, apricot 
kernels, apple seeds, and cassava (also known as yuca or manioc).

Colleagues are in shock at the loss of a
young and valued colleague who had already become an 
acknowledged leader in treating pregnant women suffering 
neurological diseases.

This is an irreplaceable loss,' said
Robert Friedlander, chairman of neurological surgery at UPMC, who 
recruited Dr. Klein in 2011.

Lawrence
Wechsler, chairman of the neurology department at UPMC, added: 'Autumn 
was a pioneer as well as a caring doctor, wonderful teacher, researcher 
and mentor.’

She moved to Pittsburgh with her 
husband, Robert Ferrante, a leading researcher in ALS and 
Huntington's disease from Harvard Medical School, who also recruited by 
Friedlander to become a Pitt professor of neurological surgery.

Klein, 41, headed the women's neurology division at UPMC Presbyterian

The
victim’s mother Cook Klein, 79, was due to fly to Pennsylvania from her
home in Towson, Maryland to babysit for her daughter she her son-in-law
broke the news that Autumn had been rushed to hospital.

Initially she was told her daughter may 
have suffered a stroke. When she heard about the cyanide, her first 
concern was for her granddaughter and who would pick her up from school if 
police needed to speak to her father.

Police told her that Cianna was with her father.

Paying tribute to her daughter, Cook Klein described her as a ‘wonderful human being and a fantastic mother’

‘I don't know of anybody that would have a reason to try to hurt her,’ she said.

In addition to her husband, daughter and mom, Autumn is survived by her father William Klein; a stepdaughter, Kimberly Ferrante of San Diego; and a stepson, Michael Ferrante of Boston.
