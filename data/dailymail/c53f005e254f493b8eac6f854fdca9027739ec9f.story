Shrink me: Ultimo's new Boobs Minus cream claims to lift, firm, reshape and shrink breasts

She has made millions helping women enhance their cleavage with her Ultimo bra range.

Now entrepreneur Michelle Mone wants to cash in on those feeling the burden of a bigger bosom.

The 40-year-old is launching a new USculpt range of creams which claim to offer the first 'breast reduction in a bottle'.

The product, entitled Boobs Minus, will cost £39.50 for 150ml and will be on sale in Boots.

Its launch comes at a time when British women’s breast size is rapidly increasing – in the fifties the average cup size was a B, but now it’s risen to a C.

In the past three years, the number of D-cups and above sold by Marks & Spencer has doubled, accounting for a quarter of all bra sales.

The biggest strapped bra on the market comes in a size 48N, created by Rigby & Peller, the Queen’s underwear retailer.

Last year 5,291 breast reductions 
were performed in the UK – an increase of 6.2 per cent on 2010 - and it 
is estimated hundreds more women opted to have the procedure abroad.

Speaking to MailOnline, Miss
 Mone said: 'I'm so excited about the new USculpt product range.

'We have been developing this for three years and spent £1million in order to get to our launch today.

'I wanted to put Boobs Minus to the test myself and have seen incredible results.

'I used it twice a day for just four weeks and I’m amazed to say I’ve dropped half a cup size already!

'I've spoken to many women in my career about their boobs and many have said they want to tone and firm them without going under the knife.

'I'm so pleased to give them another option with Boobs Minus and I'm sure other women will achieve great results as well.'

She added: 'I always listen to the needs of my customers, and many 
women I have spoken to would love to reduce their bust size.

'A breast 
reduction is a major operation and I believe this [cream] is a great 
alternative.

'When I was 
developing the product I gave samples to friends to try and the results 
have been incredible with reports of a dramatic one-cup size decrease 
after using it over an eight-week period.'

She added that product had taken over three years to develop and an investment of £1 million pounds.

There will also be a Boobs Plus cream that claims to enhance the bust and is designed to plump, lift and firm the breasts, and a B.L.T. product which targets the bottom, legs and tummy.

Miss Mone claims that the Boobs- product contains 'firming ingredients' such as extracts of rainforest fruits such as Acai, Cupuaçu, and Maracuja, to minimise the signs of ageing.

But the main ingredient is Wild Indigo, a herb which switches the cells that activate the breakdown of fat in the body.

The cream also features Golden 
Chamomile which is a flavonoid – a type of anti-oxidant which tests 
suggest helps inhibit the storage of fat and boosts breakdown of fat 
cells.

But the company was unable to provide any figures showing if consumers have found the product effective.

It has been a difficult year for Miss
 Mone, who has split from Michael, her husband of 20 years. He left her 
for her former colleague and designer Samantha Bunn at Christmas.

But
 last month it was revealed she had put her heartbreak behind her and 
found love again. She is now dating Dubai-based financier Karl French.
