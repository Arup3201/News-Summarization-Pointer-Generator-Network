A shortage of midwives and beds is resulting in 'conveyor-belt' healthcare according to experts 

New mothers are sent home from hospital more quickly in Britain than anywhere else in the EU.

A shortage of midwives and beds is resulting in ‘conveyor-belt’ care that can put mother and baby’s health at risk, experts warn.

The average hospital stay for a normal delivery in Britain is just 1.5 days, a major report revealed yesterday, compared with an EU average of 3.6. French mothers typically stay for 4.2 days, while in Hungary, Romania and Slovakia they stay for five.

Britain’s maternity wards have been under pressure for years, largely because the birth rate has outstripped government expectations – rising by almost a quarter in the last decade – meaning not enough midwives have been recruited. 

Staff are concerned that too many exhausted mothers are sent home before they have properly recovered from labour, or got to grips with basic baby care.

Yesterday’s OECD report states: ‘The average length of stay for a normal delivery in EU countries ranges from less than two days, in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, to five days or more in [Slovakia], Romania and Hungary.’ 

It warns: ‘Too short a stay could also cause adverse effects on health outcomes, or reduce the comfort and recovery of the patient.’

Cathy Warwick, general secretary of the Royal College of Midwives, said: ‘Midwives are under pressure to get women home earlier and earlier ... women in labour are basically queuing for a bed, so those in the post-natal wards have to be discharged far more quickly than we would like.’ 

She added: ‘Midwives say too often it feels conveyor belt-like ... they are under pressure to get a woman out and home.’

Elizabeth Duff of the National Childbirth Trust said: ‘This is a complex issue ... having a short stay may be the right thing for women who’ve had straightforward births as they often feel better at home.’

However, she added it is ‘crucial that women are not sent home before they are ready due to a lack of hospital staff, or leave because they want to get away from chaotic postnatal wards’.

Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for Rochdale, said: ‘Even Mary was allowed to stay in the stable for longer than one-and-a-half days ... what the Government needs to do is recruit more midwives.’

The study, which examined every EU nation except Estonia, found that stays have become shorter ‘in nearly all countries over the past decade’, with Britain’s average falling from 1.8 days in 2000.

The report did not distinguish between first babies and subsequent pregnancies, which typically result in quicker deliveries.

Dr Catherine Calderwood, clinical director for maternity at NHS England, said: ‘Although many women prefer to go home as soon as possible, it is vital that they receive the care and support they need after they give birth.

‘This is why new mums will only return home once they are well enough and ready, and will continue to receive postnatal care from a community midwife for up to 28 days after giving birth.’
