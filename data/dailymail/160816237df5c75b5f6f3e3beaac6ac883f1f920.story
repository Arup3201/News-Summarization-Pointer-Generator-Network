When he bought it for £6,500, it was little more than a shack to shelter in while he worked as a lifeguard.

But Adam Wooler’s modest investment had the all-important factor…location. After razing it to the ground, he built an idyllic holiday home in its place which is now earning him £100,000 a year.

Perched on the edge of a 300ft cliff, the chalet, with triple-glazed windows and heated floors, enjoys uninterrupted views of Whitsand Bay in Cornwall.

Idyllic: Adam Wooler transformed a ramshackle shed into this stunning cliff-top retreat that earns more than £100,000 pounds a year in rent

View: The clifftop retreat boasts stunning coastal views of Whitsand Bay, in Cornwall

Cosy: Mr Wooler and his wife Katherine invested £100,000 to turn it into the luxury holiday retreat, which has a kitchen, lounge, bedroom, shower room and sun terrace

Mr Wooler, 47, bought the hut more than 25 years ago while he studied at Plymouth University.

He did little with it for much of that
time, but after marrying and moving further along the coast to Dorset, 
he and his new wife Katherine decided to invest £100,000 to create a 
luxury bolthole.

They now rent out the retreat all year
round for between £1,500 and £2,900 a week. With an occupancy rate of 
80 per cent, the annual return should be around £100,000.

Aimed at couples looking for a 
romantic break, the chalet, called The Edge, is already booked up for 
most of the spring and summer.

Married: Adam Wooler, with his wife Katherine, who transformed the hut he lived in as a student 25 years previously

Perfect position: The chalet has bi-folding patio doors to make the most of the uninterrupted coastal views

Booked up: The chalet, called The Edge, is aimed at honeymooners and couples looking for a romantic break, but is already full for most of spring and summer

Clifftop: The building is perched on the edge of a 300ft cliff, and was Mr Wooler's home while he was studying at university, before it was turned into the luxury retreat

Beautiful: Pop star Duffy has been one of the guests who have been able to enjoy stunning sunsets, such as this, while staying at the isolated seaside retreat

Mr Wooler said: ‘It was nothing more than a wooden shack on a cliff with one room and an outside loo when I bought it.

‘I lived in it for 18 months...and 
nearly got blown away with it a few times. I left it as it was for 25 
years and couldn’t really afford to do anything with it. It has only 
been the last 18 months that we managed to get the funding and planning 
permission in place that we could really do something with it.

Eco-friendly: The chalet measures 23ft by 13ft and has been made out of eco-friendly cedar wood

Inside: Along with being well insulated, the building has underfloor heating and triple-glazed windows

Ambitions: The couple hope to buy another chalet nearby and transform it into a holiday let geared up for families

Worth it: Mr Wooler said: 'People are happy to pay the rental price for it because of the views and the high standard finish'

‘We are delighted with how it has 
turned out. It has been designed to make the most of the views and is 
now a really romantic getaway.’ The Edge, which has one bedroom, a 
kitchen, lounge and shower room, is made out of eco-friendly cedar wood.

Mr Wooler and his 37-year-old garden designer wife have just  had a baby.

They hope to buy another chalet nearby and transform it into a holiday let especially for families.

Bidders will have the chance to own a piece of the Cumbrian coast when an historic four-mile stretch goes under the hammer.

The length of Morecambe Bay foreshore (pictured below), from Roosebeck to Bardsea, will be split into five lots and sold separately at auction next week.

The land, which includes pockets of woodland and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, belongs to John Poole, former senior partner of Poole Townsend, who bought it from the Crown around 18 months ago.

Mr Poole has sold much of the surrounding land locally, but the five areas of foreshore remain 'superfluous' and Ulverston auctioneer Howard Whitaker has been tasked with selling them.

Mr Whitaker said nearby former Crown plots of one acre to one-and-a-half-acres have sold for between £2,000 and £4,000.  

He said the title of the land dates back to William the Conqueror, who gave it to the first Baron le Fleming - whose family owned large amounts of land in Furness during the 12th and 13th centuries.

But he said no matter the outcome, public access to the foreshore cannot be impeded, and the owner cannot remove the shingles or fence from the land.

Ownership would give the highest bidder powers such as the authority to move on a travelling community or exercise the 28-day rule - which would allow them to reside on the land for up to a maximum of 28 days.

The experienced auctioneer said he had never sold anything like this in almost half a century in the profession.

'It's a beauty spot, it's a pretty place in a lovely location and it's a very unusual sale,' said Mr Whitaker.

'In 46 years of professional auctioneering, I've never been asked to sell anything like this and I don't think I ever will again.'
