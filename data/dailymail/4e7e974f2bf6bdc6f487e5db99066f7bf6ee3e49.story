No Plan B: Mr Salmond hinted that not keeping the pound would be like settling for second best

Alex Salmond has admitted there is no acceptable 'Plan B' if an independent Scotland is barred from using the British pound.

The First Minister said dropping the pound 'implies settling for what's second best' - but still insisted there will be a deal on a currency union with the rest of the UK.

His admission came as Labour leader Ed Miliband revealed he will campaign again a currency union in the event of a 'yes' vote.

In an open letter to voters, Mr Salmond set out why he has not yielded to calls to disclose a back-up plan, if his favoured option of sharing the pound and the Bank of England fails.

The letter, published in the Sun, declared: 'It is revealing that our opponents in the No camp like to talk about a "Plan B" on currency.

'It's revealing because it says it all about what they think of Scotland.

'Plan B implies settling for what's second best. And neither myself, my colleagues in the SNP, or the wider Yes campaign will ever settle for second best for Scotland.

'The last thing I would do is back a plan which wasn't the best one for Scotland.'

He said Scotland would be 'willing and able' to take on its share of national debt, but could not be expected to do so if it does not get a fair share of the Bank of England.

'That means taxpayers in the rest of the UK would be lumbered with up to £5billion a year in debt interest payments,' he wrote.

'And Scotland would start life as an independent country debt-free. That's just one of the many good reasons there will be a currency union.'

The First Minister's stance is at odds with the three main parties at Westminster, who have already ruled out the prospect of a formal currency union.

Ed Miliband has revealed he will make a 
manifesto commitment to block a ‘currency union’ with a separate 
Scotland as voters urgently demand a ‘plan B’ from Alex Salmond.

Mr Salmond's preference would see Scotland retain the Bank of England as its lender of last resort. 

A new 
Survation poll for the Scottish Daily Mail has revealed that a 
staggering 69 per cent of Scots want the Scottish Government to draw up 
alternatives to keeping the pound before September’s referendum.

Four-fifths
 of respondents said the choice of currency is important to them in the 
case of separation, demonstrating the scale of the crisis now facing the
 SNP.

Following 
Tuesday’s bruising TV debate with Alistair Darling, when Mr Salmond 
failed to answer questions about his ‘plan B’, the First Minister has 
since childishly claimed ‘it’s Scotland’s pound and we’re keeping it’.

Veto: Ed Miliband has revealed he will make a manifesto pledge to block a currency union with Scotland

On
 Thursday, he bizarrely argued that the rest of the UK would have to 
accept a deal because it would be the ‘sovereign will’ of the people of 
Scotland following a Yes vote.

But
 on a visit to Glasgow yesterday, Labour leader Mr Miliband said that 
should Scots vote to leave the Union, he would stand on a platform in 
next year’s General Election to rule out a deal.

If he won the election, that would give him a clear mandate from the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Scottish
 Finance Secretary John Swinney yesterday said the cross-party refusal 
'will crumble after a Yes vote' in the face of higher costs to UK 
businesses to trade with Scotland.

'If alarm bells were ringing after Tuesday night, they should be ringing
 much, much louder when you’ve got them saying we’re going to default on
 our debts'

- Ed Miliband

But
 Mr Miliband said only 10 per cent of UK trade goes to Scotland and 
pointed out that 40 per cent of UK trade goes to Europe, which has not 
compelled Britain to join the euro.

Former 
Labour chancellor Alistair Darling also said the UK Treasury would be 
'phlegmatic' about paying Scotland’s share of the debt – around 
£5billion a year from the Treasury’s £700billion budget.

Mr Miliband said Mr Salmond has had ‘40 years to come up with an answer, and with 40 days to go he still has no answer’.

He
 added: 'If alarm bells were ringing after Tuesday night, they should be
 ringing much, much louder when you’ve got them saying we’re going to 
default on our debts'.

Asked if he 
would include a pledge in his 2015 General Election manifesto to veto a 
currency union, Mr Miliband replied: 'Yes. I’m ruling it out now.'

The
 new Survation poll shows that 56 per cent of Yes voters want Mr Salmond
 to draw up a ‘plan B’, with only 35 per cent content for the First 
Minister to remain silent.

The
 alternatives are a separate Scottish currency – either pegged to the 
pound or with a flexible exchange rate - joining the euro, or using the 
pound unilaterally in the way that East Timor and Panama use the U.S. 
dollar.

Keeping
 the pound is by far the preferred option for Scots, but if a deal is 
ruled out a separate currency pegged to the pound is the most popular, 
according to the poll.

Mr
 Salmond has gambled his political future on convincing voters that 
Labour, the Tories and the Lib Dems are bluffing when they said they 
would rule out a currency union.

The poll shows that 40 per cent agree with this, and 39 per cent of Scots believe they are telling the truth.
