Adrian Chiles could take legal action over his departure as ITV's lead football host, it was claimed on BBC Radio 4's Media Show. 

It was announced on Friday that Mark Pougatch will take over from Chiles with immediate effect, and after ITV refused to comment on the departure, Radio 4's Steve Hewlett expects lawyers to get involved.

'It is highly unusual to have a big name make such an abrupt departure from such a high-profile role,' Hewlett said. 'I suspect lawyers will soon be involved.'

It is not clear as to why Chiles was removed from his role at the forefront of ITV's football coverage, just halfway through his contract.

Chiles was given a one-year contract extension shortly before the World Cup last year, and it is understood that he was told last week that ITV wanted to terminate it. 

It was a one-year deal worth around £500,000  just to host football. He  had to take a £1million cut in salary at that time as he was no longer hosting the doomed Daybreak breakfast show.
