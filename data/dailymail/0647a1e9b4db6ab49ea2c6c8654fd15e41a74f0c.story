A skeleton of man still wearing pyjamas in bed is believed to have lain undiscovered for more than 15 years in an abandoned house.

French police are trying to identify the body, found in the northern city of Lille, which is thought to be that of the elderly owner of the property.

The man lived alone and appeared to have no relatives. Authorities found piles of unopened post dating back to 1996 at the house.

He was of Spanish origin and born in 1921, according to French reports.

‘The state of the house suggests it was a peaceful death of someone who died in his bed,’ public safety official Didier Perroudon said.

He added that no concerns had been raised about the man’s absence, and told French news agency AFP: ‘He was in his bed, in his pyjamas.'

Mr Perroudon said: ‘There was no mess. The house was locked from the inside. Nothing suggests a criminal act.’

The unidentified man’s body was taken away for an autopsy to be done.

He was found dead last Friday when a health safety inspector commissioned by the city visited the house.

Mr Perroudon added: ‘For the moment, we do not know anymore.

'The investigation starts. It will take some time to discover where he comes from, what he did and what his connections were.’
