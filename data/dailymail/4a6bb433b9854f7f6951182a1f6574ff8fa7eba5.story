AC Milan are showing a surprise interest in Samuel Eto'o. Roma and Guangzhou Evergrande in China are also keeping tabs on the evergreen 33-year-old striker.

Milan are looking at forward options as they await bids for Mario Balotelli. They are also keen to find bargains with money still extremely tight at the San Siro and free agent Eto'o is a possibility but not their main target.

Lethal: Eto'o may not have been a first choice starter at Chelsea but he showed he can still score goals

Old man: The Cameroon striker fell out with Jose Mourinho over comments the manager made about his age

They will look to offload other members of their squad to raise funds and that is why they are listening to offers for Balotelli and midfielder Nigel de Jong, who will be offered to Manchester United.

Eto'o already knows Milan well having played for AC's city rivals Inter from 2009 to 2011, winning the Champions League under Jose Mourinho in his first season in Italy.

Free agent: Eto'o endured a difficult World Cup with Cameroon but could be on his way to Milan

Returning: Both Mario Balotelli (left) and Nigel de Jong (right) could be in line for a Premier League return

The former Barcelona striker only joined Chelsea last summer and scored 12 goals in 34 games in all competitions.

Eto'o was named in Cameroon's World Cup squad but started just one game due to injury problems.
