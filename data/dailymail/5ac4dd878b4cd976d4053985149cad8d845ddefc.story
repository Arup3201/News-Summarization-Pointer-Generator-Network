Missing: Police are today hunting for teenager Adam Dugmore, who detectives say is struggling to come to terms with the death of his younger brother

Police have issued an urgent appeal to trace a missing teenager who is struggling to come to terms with the death of his nine-year-old brother.

Adam Dugmore, 16, was heartbroken when his sibling Aaron hanged himself in February this year.

Adam was reported missing by his father at 11am today after he failed to turn up for school.

He was last seen at around 8.45am leaving the family home in Erdington, Birmingham.

West Midland Police launched a massive manhunt for Adam and are searching parks and wastelands in the surrounding area.

The youngster, a pupil at North Birmingham Academy, was last seen wearing his black school uniform under a grey zip-up hoodie.

He is described as 5ft 8ins tall, of slim build, with short blonde hair and brown eyes.

The keen Aston Villa fan was wearing grey Ralph Lauren pumps and was carrying a yellow JD sports drawstring bag and was carrying a quantity of birthday cash.

Chief Superintendent Rachel Jones, commander for the Birmingham north local policing unit, said: 'He was reported missing to police at 11am by his dad who found out that he hadn't turned up for school.

'Adam has been struggling to come to terms with the death of his nine-year-old brother, Aaron, who took his own life in February this year and officers are anxious to know that he is safe and well.

'For Adam to go off in such circumstances is a cause for concern for us.

'His parents are beside themselves with worry and we are doing everything we can to find him.

'I would ask that anyone who has seen Adam today calls us as a matter of urgency. I would also appeal directly to Adam to contact us.

'Adam you are not in any trouble. We all just want to know that you are safe and well.'

Adam's brother was being tormented by an Asian gang of bullies at his new school because he was white.

His
parents claimed Aaron was threatened with a plastic knife by one Asian 
pupil, who warned him: 'Next time it will be a real one.'

On August 26 this year Adam wrote a heartfelt message on what would have been his brother's 10th birthday.

Updating his Facebook status, he said: 'Happy birthday aaron love you so much r.i.p 3xxxxxx'

In his first post about Aaron after his death in February this year, Adam wrote: 'Miss my brother so much' on July 6.

Less than 12 hours before he went missing, Adam also posted a normal Facebook status saying he was looking forward to a football game between Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion this evening.

Younger brother Aaron was found hanged in his bedroom at the family home by mum Kelly Dugmore, 30, at about 6pm on February 11.

He was rushed to hospital where doctors desperately attempted to revive him but he later died.

His family claimed that the schoolboy had been suffering at the hands of bullies at Erdington Hall Primary School.

Police have asked that if anyone has seen Adam, or anyone knows his whereabouts, should call West Midlands Police immediately on 101.
