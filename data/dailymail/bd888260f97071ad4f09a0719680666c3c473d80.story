For most clubs, it would be sufficient to fill a working week with Champions League quarter-final qualification, the resignation and jailing of their legendary president plus the outside world poring over every grim detail. 

But Bayern Munich are not, and have never been, any old club. Partly thanks to the career of Franz ‘Der Kaiser’ Beckenbauer.

Nevertheless, in the full knowledge that his World Cup-winning former West Germany and Bayern team-mate, Uli Hoeness, was likely to be convicted and given jail time the following day and that for some in Bavaria it might already feel like the world was caving in, Beckenbauer chose Wednesday to rake the club’s current football philosophy and expensively-hired new coach with his perpetually sharp claws.

Not his way? Pep Guardiola reacts during Bayern's victory over Arsenal in the Champions League

Defensive: Bayern Munich legend Franz Beckenbauer was uncomplimentary on Guardiola's tactics

To explain. It’s the 36th minute of the European champions’ 1-1 draw with Arsenal in Munich. David Alaba has driven forward and, having scored six times from the left-back position for club and country this season, feels entitled to shoot. The Austrian drags an effort meekly wide.

On the touchline Pep Guardiola grimaces, not in frustration that the ball hasn’t gone in but at Alaba’s choice of action. The Catalan briefly beats both hands on his shaven skull.

With 26 minutes left, Bastian Schweinsteiger sees a free channel down the middle of the pitch, just like the one he used to burst through and score 10 minutes previously.

He strides towards goal and, when Laurent Koscielny attempts to close him down, instead of passing to either Philipp Lahm or Mario Mandzukic, who are free, he shoots over from the edge of the box.This time Guardiola is angry. From the touchline he calls Schweinsteiger’s attention in order to reprimand him.

Beckenbauer can’t believe it —  and tells the world on Sky Germany: ‘This will end with us resembling Barcelona and nobody will want to watch us. We risk boring the fans. These players are being told to pass the ball right up to the goal-line.

‘If this is now the Bayern philosophy, it may bring us our joyful moments but we’ll probably end up playing like Barcelona and, when we actually get to the goal-line, we’ll recycle the ball and pass it backwards rather than scoring.

‘I have another view. If I can shoot from distance, above all against a massed defence, then I have to do that. It’s an effective formula.’

Where to begin.

Notwithstanding Paul Breitner, Gerd Muller or Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Beckenbauer is by some distance the club’s greatest footballer — world champion for Bayern and West Germany as player and coach.

Wild: David Alaba was another who irked Guardiola after he shot when the Spaniard wished he hadn't

Currently Bayern’s honorary president, his role is non-executive. Even if some of his declarations are now taken with a pinch of salt, such denigratory words about the football fundamentals of the Guardiola era will undermine the coach, give fuel to any player unhappy under the Catalan’s steely rule and the use of a word like ‘boring’ will obviously not thrill the sponsors who help fund the coach’s £7.5m (nine million euros) salary.

It wouldn’t be accurate to call the words a ‘cheap shot’. No question they are what Der Kaiser believes. But the timing stinks. With the departure of Hoeness and promotion of his deputy on Bayern’s company advisory board, Herbert Hainer (Adidas chairman), there is the opportunity for further corporate instability.

The thudding shock of the outgoing man’s jail term will reverberate amongst players, media and fans for a considerable time. Hoeness is indelibly linked to Bayern’s sense of wellbeing and identity.

For Beckenbauer to call into question the entire Guardiola experiment is therefore something which both the Catalan (extremely sensitive to such matters) and his employers could have done without.

Guardiola has already explained, clearly, also to Sky: ‘To have big, big possession but not create chances and just defend — that’s not football. I like when my team has the ball but possession for itself is nothing. I like it more when the ball goes at high speed to the players in the right positions than the players move position a lot.’

Bayern have romped the Bundesliga and should contest the German Cup Final against Borussia Dortmund. Retaining the Champions League now becomes the top priority.

Sore though Bayern’s former coach Jupp Heynckes will be that his firm friend Hoeness has fallen so far, the 67-year-old will still afford a grim chuckle at Guardiola’s expense.

Heynckes had to cope with all of this himself.

Cope and thrive. This is how he deconstructs his handling of the  traumas of Bayern.

‘You’ve got to be able to transmit a sense of serenity to your players,’ he said. ‘Kalle (Rummenigge) and Uli (Hoeness) had a tendency to panic and ask too many questions. I learned early on how to cope with stress.

‘Despite having to compete for places, my players were all pulling in the same direction. The atmosphere in the dressing room was exceptional. I handed over a complete, ultra-competitive team to my successor.’

Ultra-competitive it remains. But is the harmony in jeopardy? The next few weeks will be the litmus test.
