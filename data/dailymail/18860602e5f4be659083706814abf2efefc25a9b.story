The former vice-madam plans to publish a book describing her alleged connection with the politician

The former dominatrix has had her home raided by police weeks before the release of her autobiography in which she makes fresh claims about George Osborne.

Up to 12 drugs squad officers searched Natalie Rowe's flat for two hours but found nothing.

Miss Rowe, who once used the name 'Miss Whiplash' claimed it was an attempt to smear her ahead of the book's publication later this month.

Her memoirs are expected to be embarrassing for Mr Osborne, who was allegedly a regular guest at parties at her flat in the early 1990s.

Mr Osborne was embroiled in a scandal in 2005, when a picture surfaced showing him in his twenties sitting alongside Miss Rowe when she was working as a dominatrix known as 'Mistress Pain'.

Miss Rowe said her home, in Chelsea, west London, was raided just 48 hours after a paper revealed the book's release date.

She claims that while they raided her home one officer asked her about the book and another told her it would open 'a whole can of worms' if she complained. 

She told the Sunday People: 'I'm not into conspiracy theories.

'I'd like to think the fact that I've been unfairly targeted by the police has nothing to do with the fact that my book is about to be published, which happens to be very embarrassing for the Chancellor.

'But it's certainly made me wonder.'

The former madam claims that her home was raided on October 2, and she was locked in her living room while police searched her home.

They told her they had been tipped off by a member of the public that there were drugs in her property - a claim that Miss Rowe strongly denies.

She claims that she was not allowed to call a lawyer and officer spent nearly two hours combing her home for drugs, but they did not find any.

Apparently the autobiographical book will contain 'embarrassing revelations' about George Osborne, who was pictured with Miss Rowe when he was in his twenties

She says that she warned them not to read the manuscript of her book, which she had left on her bed, and was asked if she was 'writing her memoirs'.

Miss Rowe also claims that when she called up 
to complain about how police stormed her home, she was told that she was
 about to 'open up a whole can of worms'.

The former dominatrix has made an 
official complaint to Scotland Yard and plans to contact the Independent Police
 Complaints Commission.

When Miss Rowe met Mr Osborne, she was dating William Sinclair, a member of one of the country’s biggest landowning families.

He and the future Chancellor were members of Oxford University’s Bullingdon Club, a male-only institution with a reputation for heavy drinking and riotous behaviour.

Miss Rowe has previously claimed that Mr Osborne knew that she had an escort agency and once discovered whips and sex toys in her apartment.

She said he had 'found it quite amusing.’

She said the party at which Mr Osborne was photographed was held to celebrate her becoming pregnant by Mr Sinclair.

She added: ‘It was definitely cocaine on the table.

‘I remember vividly on that particular night I said to George, jokingly, "When you are prime minister one day I will have all the dirty goods on you" and he laughed.

Although the picture was taken before Mr 
Osborne entered politics, it was published when he had taken centre 
stage in the Conservative party as shadow chancellor.

His response was to deny that there was cocaine on the table and insisted that any suggestion that he took drugs was 'defamatory and completely untrue.'

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Following information received, officers based in Kensington and Chelsea obtained a warrant to search an address under Section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 on October 2.

'No drugs were found and no one was arrested.

'A formal complaint was received on October 9. It has been referred to the Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS). We are not prepared to discuss further.'
