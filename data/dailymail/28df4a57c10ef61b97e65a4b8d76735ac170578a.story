Anthony Taylor ended 2014 with a refereeing call that had Jose Mourinho crying conspiracy and has started the new year on the receiving end of an almighty attack from Garry Monk.

Swansea’s manager was so angry with two decisions here that he went as far as to suggest the official should serve a suspension, having already claimed he is ‘losing faith’ in referees as a collective. It was powerful stuff from a man who frequently in his press briefing said: ‘I am limited in what I can say.’

Not that such gripes from Monk are anything new, even if he has often been in the right. Indeed, Swansea do seem to have been on the wrong end of a hefty number of decisions, particularly the type that matter, like red cards.

QPR keeper Rob Green appeared to handle the ball outside the area after intercepting a Wayne Routledge attack 

There were two such incidents in this game and Monk thinks Taylor got both of them wrong. He was incredulous that Rob Green could stay on the pitch after six minutes when he handled outside the box to stop Wayne Routledge.

And he was furious that Taylor then sent off Routledge four minutes from full-time for kicking out at Karl Henry. For good measure, he also accused Henry of being ‘reckless’ in performing the ‘leg-breaker’ of a tackle that drove Routledge to retaliate.

Among it all, it was almost possible to forget that Wilfried Bony came off the bench to score a stoppage-time leveller after Leroy Fer’s stunning opener after 20 minutes. For Monk, though, the sense of frustration is getting unbearable, having already seen Jonjo Shelvey handed a retrospective four-game ban this week.

He said: ‘I am losing a bit of faith and so are my players when we continuously have decisions like this. 

‘I just hope that Wayne’s card gets rescinded. He goes from nearly having a leg broken to being sent off. He (Routledge) nudges him (Henry) away. No justice whatsoever.

‘With the other one (Rob Green’s handball) it is a half metre outside the box. The linesman has a clear view. Not sure how you miss that. We have a lot of people missing things. I am tired of talking about it.

‘I have been involved 20 years in professional football. I understand you get bad decisions but we seem to get a succession of bad ones. 

'I have asked the referee to help rescind it (Routledge’s red card) which will be the right thing for us and football.’

Asked if officials should serve a suspension for game-changing errors, Monk added: ‘I lose a player and I have to suffer so officials should suffer as well.’

While his claims about Routledge’s red card are more dubious, there was no doubting Green was lucky to stay on for the first infringement after six minutes.

Routledge had gone clean through after a flick from  Sigurdsson and went to round Green. The goalkeeper was outside his area and handled; the referee who wrongly booked Chelsea’s Cesc Fabregas for diving against Southampton on Sunday guaranteed himself more flak.

‘I did not see it,’ said Harry Redknapp.

The QPR manager is contending a strange old season. Utterly incompetent on the road, where they have lost all their matches, their form at Loftus Road has been the saving grace. They led here after 20 minutes through a sublime finish from Fer and Zamora then blew a chance to double the lead.

What followed should, perhaps, have caused Monk as much anxiety as the refereeing. Certainly, his words about Taylor should not disguise the profligacy of his attackers on a day when they had 24 shots and only scored with the last.

Bony, surprisingly, was left on the bench, even though Monk later insisted it was nothing to do with speculation that the striker is a target for Manchester City.

In his place, Gomis proved more mobile but not nearly as effective in front of goal. He missed all manner of chances.

For a while the misses appeared decisive. QPR had missed plenty of their own, but with only 40 per cent of the possession were clinging on. Their chances improved when Routledge saw red but then a Bony sucker punch.

Redknapp said: ‘It’s a big blow. It happened here with Liverpool in the last second when we should have drawn.

‘These were two vital points that we deserved and needed but couldn’t hang on.’

A new year and the same old gripes.
