Rafael Nadal returned to winning ways just a fortnight after being diagnosed with appendicitis.

Despite a visit to hospital and being prescribed a course of antibiotics, world number three Nadal still played in the Shanghai Masters earlier this month, only to lose to Spanish compatriot Feliciano Lopez.

Nadal, who is hoping to delay surgery until after the ATP World Tour Finals at The O2 in London next month, had expressed his fears regarding his health at entering this week's event in Basle, the Swiss Indoors.

But the 28-year-old, seeded number two behind home favourite Roger Federer, was clinical in disposing of Italy's Simone Bolleli 6-2 6-2.

Nadal broke twice in each set and won 81 per cent of his first-serve points to clinch victory in an hour.

Nadal will now face French qualifier Pierre-Hugues Herbert in round two after the world number 120 caused an upset.

Herbert beat compatriot Edouard Roger-Vasselin, ranked 56 places ahead of him, 6-3 6-7 (5/7) 7-6 (7/3) in a match lasting two hours and 20 minutes.

In the opening match of the tournament, Donald Young defeated Carlos Berlocq from Argentina 7-6 (7/5) 6-4 and will now face either fellow American Steve Johnson or number four seed Milos Raonic.

In the day's other first-round game, Belgian number seven seed David Goffin beat Austria's Dominic Thiem 7-6 (7/4) 6-3.

Five-times champion Federer begins his bid for a sixth title on Wednesday with a clash with Luxembourg's Gilles Muller, a man he has beaten in all four meetings to date.
