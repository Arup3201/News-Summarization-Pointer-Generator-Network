John Terry has closed the door on a return to the England team despite his man-of-the-match performance at Wembley on Sunday.

The former England captain retired from international football when he was suspended by the FA and banned for using racially insulting language towards Anton Ferdinand in 2011.

After being cleared in a magistrates' court, he quit England in September 2012 after he was punished by the FA.

Terry, belting out the national anthem at Euro 2012, represented England 78 times and scored six goals

Caps: 78.

Goals: 6.

Games as captain: 34 (August 2006 - October 2009, March 2011 - November 2011).

Debut: vs Serbia and Montenegro (H), friendly, June 3, 2003.

Last game: vs Moldova (A), World Cup qualifier, September 7, 2012.

Terry, 34, is playing some of the best football of his career but he cannot be tempted out of retirement.

'No, is the simple answer,' he said in response to questions about whether he would make an England return. 'I don’t want to go into it right now.

'Being back at Wembley, the atmosphere, the stadium, it’s one of the best I have played in, but it’s never crossed my mind.

'I have drawn a line under it and the England squad can move on now.

'They started playing the national anthem before the game and I was going then. I was ready before the game, I have missed it, playing in these big stadiums, and in these competitions. I’m delighted to get back to Wembley.'

Terry captained England for two separate periods before quitting in 2012 after he was punished by the FA

Terry's England career saw him pick up 78 caps over a nine-year period and he was part of the squad at the World Cup in 2006 and 2010 as well as the European Championship in 2004 and 2012.

He was twice named as captain, once under Steve McClaren - before later being stripped of the title - and again by Fabio Capello. 

Terry scored the opening goal for Chelsea as they ran out 2-0 winners over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, and was named the man of the match for his performance.

And the Chelsea skipper, who was part of Jose Mourinho's dominant Chelsea side in his first spell between 2004 and 2007, saw the Wembley win as the start of a new blue era.

'That's the first one, it's massive. It meant an awful lot to us (to win the League Cup) in 2004-05 in Jose's first year here,' Terry told Sky Sports.

'That (Sunday's win) could be the start of something special but we have to kick on and we have the league to focus on, but it's a great day and a great win.

It was a successful afternoon for Terry, but he later rejected talk of a return to the England set-up at Wembley

'The pressure was there before the game, obviously, but that's what cup finals do to you. I thought we played very well, handled the game very well and we're delighted with the win.

'I think it was a fairly even first half, second half I thought we controlled it a little bit better and deserved to win.'
