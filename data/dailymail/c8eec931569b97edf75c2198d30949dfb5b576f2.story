Pauline Cafferkey (pictured) faces disciplinary action over claims she concealed being unwell when she returned from Africa

The nurse who became the first Briton to be diagnosed with ebola in the UK faces disciplinary action over claims she concealed being unwell when she returned from Africa.

Pauline Cafferkey, who spent almost a month in an isolation unit in London earlier this year while her life hung in the balance, is one of five medics being investigated.

Their ‘fitness to practise’ is being assessed by regulators. 

According to one unsubstantiated report, a temperature test showed that Ms Cafferkey was over the limit – and others present were aware of it – but the result was not reported.

In theory, if any of the five are judged to have broken professional standards, they could be ‘struck off’. 

However, bearing in mind the nature of their lifesaving efforts in Africa, they are more likely to receive a slap on the wrist if they fail to clear their names.

It is understood the investigation centres on claims that signs of Ms Cafferkey’s illness were ignored before she flew back from Sierra Leone to Scotland, potentially placing fellow passengers at risk. 

The inquiries are an embarrassment for the UK, given the plaudits the country received for the work of British medical staff in the ebola-hit area.

The nurse, who had spent three weeks working for Save The Children at an ebola treatment centre, was diagnosed with the virus on her return to Glasgow in December. 

According to reports at the time, she had complained of feeling ill when she landed at Heathrow from Sierra Leone, but despite having her temperature tested seven times she was cleared to fly on to Scotland.

When Ms Cafferkey, 39, became feverish, she was transferred by RAF Hercules back to London to be treated at the Royal Free Hospital.

After being treated with blood plasma from an ebola survivor and an experimental new drug, she made a full recovery.

Now Ms Cafferkey and two other nurses are being investigated by their governing body, the Nursing and Midwifery Council, while two doctors in their party are subject to a General Medical Council probe.

The investigation was launched after Department of Health officials carried out a review of the screening process at Heathrow for the 30 NHS staff who flew back from the affected region with Ms Cafferkey.

An interim hearing to decide whether Ms Cafferkey should be placed on restricted duties could be held within days: the Nursing and Midwifery Council can bar or suspend nurses from the profession because of misconduct or incompetence, or on grounds of ‘character’ or poor health. 

Officials were forced to trace more than 200 passengers who had sat close to Ms Cafferkey during her journey from Sierra Leone.

A Save The Children review concluded that she probably contracted the virus by wearing a visor as part of her protective equipment instead of goggles. 

At the time, the charity’s chief executive, Justin Forsyth, said: ‘Lessons have already been learned and as a result of the findings we have further tightened our protocols and procedures.’

Dr Martin Deahl, who sat next to Ms Cafferkey on the flight to the UK, said screening procedures at Heathrow were ‘shambolic’. 

Last night, the nursing council and GMC confirmed they were investigating allegations about the conduct of three nurses and two doctors.

A spokesman for Ms Cafferkey said last night: ‘Since she returned from Sierra Leone, Ms Cafferkey has fully co-operated with all investigations being undertaken by the relevant bodies and she will continue to do so. 

'These are ongoing and it would therefore be inappropriate for her to make any public comment at the present time.’
