It was great to win last time out in Austria at the home of Red Bull. Somebody hung a Mercedes logo on the bull in the centre of the track - the Red Bull Ring - which was cool and a bit of fun after the weekend. They have been, and still are, our No 1 rivals.

Williams were our nearest challengers in Austria, but I expect it to change to-and-from throughout the season, and I think Red Bull will be faster here at the British Grand Prix. But we will still be the quickest, although the gap is getting closer.

Prize guy: Rosberg raises the trophy at the Red Bull Ring in Austria

During qualifying for the race in Austria, we were definitely surprised, and caught off-guard as to how quick Williams, who secured a front-row lockout through Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas, were.

They were really fast and that made the race a little bit more difficult; starting third on the grid as opposed to the front row which felt a bit weird.

In Austria we were not as quick as we have been. Bottas and Massa were both very competitive and their pace was similar to ours which was surprising. But the race went well.

We had a really good strategy, and that is what won us the grand prix because we pitted earlier than both of the Williams drivers and got the undercut.

We had to manage our brakes throughout the race, which although it was planned and we knew it was coming, wasn't easy.

I had Lewis behind me, and it is always such a close battle between the both of us at every race. But I managed to stay in front and I could control the gap.

There was never any risk or any chance that he would overtake me. There have certainly been other races where it has been more difficult to keep him behind.

Our target in Austria was to extend the gap in the title race ahead of this weekend's race, I am 29 points clear, so I am happy with that.

The momentum is definitely on my side at the moment and I need to make the most of it because it comes and goes so I have to try and keep it for as long as I can.

Brilliant Britain

The British Grand Prix is always one of the best weekends on the calendar. I won it last year so I have good memories of that victory.

As a race, it is very important because both our car and engine factories are nearby, so this is effectively a home race for us. I just want to do a great job for everyone who works at, and is connected to Mercedes, because that is such a nice gift to give back.

All their friends, families and kids are talking about it, which is a great thing so I am going to go out there to try and make that happen.

The atmosphere and the support from the fans is also fantastic to see.

On Thursday, there were already plenty of people out en force even though the action on track doesn't start until 24 hours later.

The circuit itself is so quick and one that I love competing on.

Here comes the Wolff

Susie Wolff will be the first female racer to compete at a race weekend in 22 years when she takes part in practice on Friday, which I think is great.

She has done a good job, and I will be really, really interested to see how she gets on. I will definitely be looking at her lap times.

There is no reason why a woman can't make it back on to the racing grid one day.

It is more difficult because there are less trying to make it - there are a lot more guys - but there is no reason a woman couldn't make it, so maybe we will see it one day.

She has to do an all-round good job and be quick of course! She also has to show a good understanding of the car which she has and will do.

It is very exciting and the best advice I have for her is to enjoy it.

We're going to Ibiza

It was my 29th birthday earlier this week so I celebrated it with my best friends in Ibiza. It is very seldom that we all get together so it was a really good experience.

We all went out partying, but it was quite relaxed and I didn't have a big party. My friends took it to the next level, but I stayed pretty chilled out.

We still have 11 races to go - a long season ahead of us - so I need to keep all of my energy.

Germany must improve

Over in Brazil, Germany had a tough match against Algeria in their round of 16 clash. They progressed after extra-time, but they are not playing at their best level so they need to find something extra if they want to win this tournament.

They need to rotate some players and bring a different game altogether to their quarter-final tie against France later on Friday.

I will be watching it in the Mercedes motorhome after practice because I am watching every game and loving it.Â
