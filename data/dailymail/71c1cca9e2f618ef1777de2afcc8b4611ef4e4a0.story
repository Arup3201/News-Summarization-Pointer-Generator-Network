Some scream, some cry - but this little dog's reaction to being tickled couldn't be cuter.

YouTube user Billie Jean from Elk Grove, California, filmed her pet canine lying on his back while getting some TLC.

But as the pup is scratched around a tickly spot on his neck he suddenly puts his paws up over his eyes.

As soon as the tickling stops, the dog releases his legs down.

But when his neck is touched again, he takes his paws back up apparently crying with 'laugh-fur-ter'.

The pet's owner can be heard giggling as she watches the adorable scene play out.Â 

'Our puppy hates her neck being touched,' the filmer later wrote online.
