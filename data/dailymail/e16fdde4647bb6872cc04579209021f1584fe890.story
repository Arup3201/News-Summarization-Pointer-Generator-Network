A farmer couldn't believe his eyes when his stumbled upon a breast-shaped potato growing in his field.

The spud was found by amused workers at Farndon Fields Farm Shop near Market Harborough, Leicestershire, while they were grading their potatoes.

Kevin Stokes, the shop's owner and an ambassador for the Potato Council, said he is now looking into the best way to preserve the 'hilarious' tuber, which he claims is the strangest he has come across during 30 years in the industry.

The farm shop's marketing manager Nicola Stokes agreed that the potato is totally out of the ordinary, adding that it was 'the breast example she's seen in a long time.'

Ms Stokes said: 'Kevin the managing director brought it into the office and everyone fell around laughing. He'd been sorting the potatoes which had been harvested and found this. It was hilarious."

She added: 'We've been growing potatoes here for more than 30 years. We've had some odd shapes before but nothing like this'.

The potato is currently being kept out of daylight to preserve it for as long as possible, with a long-term plan to pickle it expected to be drawn up over the coming days.

Productive: Nicola Stokes says staff at Farndon Fields Farm Shop (pictured) want to do something positive with the potato and are considering using it to promote a breast cancer charity

One idea is that the potato could be auctioned to raise money for charity.

Ms Stokes said: 'It would be nice to do something productive with it. We might use it to promote a Breast Cancer campaign or something'.

In the meantime the potato is being kept away from prying eyes, hidden in a drawer on the farm.

Ms Stokes said: 'Potatoes do have a shelf life so we are exploring ways to preserve it.'

She added: 'We've put it in a dark drawer, mainly because we don't really know what to do with it.'
