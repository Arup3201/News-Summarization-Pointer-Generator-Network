Back to work: Monday is the least productive day of the week, with a third of workers saying they feel tired from the weekend (library image)

The first day of the working week is the least productive for half of the nation, new research has revealed.

About 48 per cent of Britons go to work in the wrong mindset and more than a third feel tired at the start of the week.

Furthermore, the research shows that 57 per cent of workers feel anxious and stressed during the weekend in anticipation of the working week ahead.

Half said they spent up to three hours working on or answering work emails or calls over the weekend.

The study of nearly 6,000 adults also indicated thatÂ 52 per cent believe their health and well-being is negatively impacted by work due to lack of exercise, sleep and relaxation.

45 per cent said work had a negative impact on family 
relationships, with a third considering quitting because of it.

Surprisingly, 28 per cent revealed they had been in the middle of a 'romantically
special moment' with a partner when work interfered.

In other countries this figure is higher, however. For Spaniards, work has ruined a romantic moment for six in ten people, while in Italy that figure is 46 per cent.

The research was carried out by Westin Hotels and Resorts.

Sue Firth, Occupational Psychologist at the London Stress Clinic, said: 'People need the weekend to relax and unwind from the stresses of work. That way, they come back on Monday full of energy.

'Many
of us feel obligated to answer emails at home when we should be able to
rest or make ourselves available for work discussions that could really
wait until after the weekend.

'Over
time this is going to affect a person's well-being, leaving them tired 
and moody which in turn can affect personal relationships.

'It can also make us feel resentful about work and less likely to contribute when we are in the office.

'I
tell clients to pick out a landmark a short distance from home and use 
that as a cutoff point, so that when you go past it, you mentally leave 
work behind ready to enjoy home time.

'If
you have to work at home, limit the number of evenings you'll do this 
in a week and stop working after 9pm to ensure you get a good night's 
sleep.'
