A couple claiming to be wealthy Scottish aristocrats are alleged to have raked in $165,000 over years of welfare fraud while living on their $1.2million yacht in Florida.

Colin Chisholm III, 62, and his wife Lady Andrea, 54, of Deephaven, Minnesota, have been charged with wrongfully obtaining thousands of dollars between 2005 and 2012 from various government assistance programs.

Along with a million-dollar yacht called the Andrea Aras, the couple have a grand, six-bedroom lakeside home, a beach property in Florida and a $30,000 Lexus, investigators found.

Colin Chisholm III, claims he is from a long line of Scottish aristocracy and is a wealthy broadcasting executive, according to court filings today.

'Scottish aristocrats' Colin Chisholm the Third, 62, and his wife Lady Andrea, 54, have been charged with $165,000 in welfare fraud while it is alleged they were living on a $1.2million yacht in Florida

The couple not only owned a $1.2million yacht but also a $30,000 Lexus and beach property in Florida

The couple are still at large after a search was launched by law enforcement last month.

Calls to the family home by MailOnline went unanswered today.

The Chisholms also had $3 million in bank accounts which they failed to declare, according to Hennepin County Attorney's office.

The couple were receiving public assistance for their medical care and food stamps in Minnesota for years while also allegedly collecting welfare in Florida.

According to the criminal complaint filed in February, the Chisholms applied for more than a dozen forms of medical assistance, welfare payments and food stamps.

Lady Chisholm had her prenatal care for the couple's son in 2006 paid for by the state while claiming to be desitute. 

In the welfare applications, the couple allegedly lied about where they were living and who they were living with.

Noble roots: According to their company website, the couple trace their roots to Clan Chisholm in Struy

Colin Chisholm did not declare that he ran a business nor Lady Chisholm that she had a dog kennel which breeds championship-worthy Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.

Lady Chisholm is alleged to have claimed for state prenatal care despite having millions of dollars in the bank

According to the website for their company Strathglass Kennel, the couple trace their roots to the Clan Chisholm from the small village of Struy in the Scottish Highlands.

Chisholm is listed as the president and CEO of TCN Network, a satellite TV company serving the Carribbean.

More than $1 million dollars flowed through accounts he controlled as part of that company, the complaint states.

The couple were living with Lady Chisholm's mother in Minneapolis when they first applied for welfare in 2005.

However for the next two years, they resided on their Florida yacht, and later at a beach property in the state, none of which was ever declared, investigators claim.

In April 2007, the Chisholms came back to Minnesota and filled out forms for more benefits. 

In March 2008, they moved into a luxury home in Deephaven with Andrea’s grandparents Eloise and Francis Heidecker.

Francis died in February 2009 at age 94 and by September of that year, Eloise Heidecker and the Chisholms were evicted from the home.

They immediately moved to another Deephaven home on Lake Minnetonka with stunning waterfront views.

The home, built in 1909, is believed to have six bedrooms, five bathrooms and stretch to 5,800 sq ft set on 1.6 acres.

None of these details were declaired on welfare forms - nor the fact Andrea Chisholm had power of attorney and controlled the finances of her elderly grandmother. 

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said on Friday: 'It is truly outrageous when persons of considerable means steal from the government and all of us taxpayers through abusing the social welfare system.

'We will prosecute this case with all the capacity we have.'

Hennepin County’s Human Services and Public Health Department terminated all welfare benefits to the Chisholms at the end of March 2012.

Prosecutors will ask that the judge be allowed to impose a longer sentence than the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines call for because the Chisholms committed a major economic offense.
