Britons are a nation of 'desk potatoes' with one in five admitting they remain behind their desk all day, a new poll has revealed.

Six out of ten take their car into work - despite more than a third claiming they would prefer to be able to walk to work.

Researchers for private health firm BUPA, who commissioned the study, also found the average Briton walks for only ten minutes a day.

'Desk potatoes': One in five Britons admit they remain behind their desk all day

Current medical advice is for adults to spend 30 minutes walking every day.

The main excuse given by exercise-shy Britons for failing to go walking is poor weather.

Thirty-one per cent gave this as the reason, while 26 per cent blamed lack of time and 12 per cent blamed their personal lack of fitness for not walking.

The problem is particularly acute among young adults, A quarter of Britons aged between 18 and 24 walk for just five minutes every day.

Bupa's UK Medical Director Dr Paula Franklin said: 'It's so easy to make excuses but there are many health benefits to walking.

'For most people it is the most accessible form of physical , activity. It is also free and can be great fun.

'Usually walking can fit easily into your daily routine. Something as simple as choosing to walk - even part of the way to work instead of taking the car or bus - can have a huge impact.

'For example, adding 20 minutes of walking to your day can dramatically reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart disease and strokes.'

The study, in which researchers from YouGov interviewed 2,000 people, shows women walk for 12 minutes a day and men for eight minutes.

Three in 20 adults even admitted they give up walking on the way to their destination at least once a week and use public transport instead.

Women were more likely to blame the weather and 'feeling too tired' as excuses, while men blamed their 'hectic schedules' and lack of time.

The NHS recommends that young people - aged five to 18 - should have 60 minutes of exercise every day. Older adults should do 150 minutes every week.
