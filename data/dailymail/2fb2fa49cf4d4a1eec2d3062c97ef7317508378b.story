Two years as a frustrated spectator could soon end for Tom Croft after the injury-plagued Leicester flanker was last night drafted into the England squad for the first time since 2013.

Croft has been promoted from the Saxons as cover for Northampton back row Tom Wood, who is himself undergoing assessments by Stuart Lancaster’s medical team on an ankle injury picked up in Saturday’s Champions Cup defeat by Racing Metro.

It is a rare piece of good news for Croft, 29, and a reward for his endeavour where many might have given up. The British and Irish Lion has suffered rotten luck throughout his career; with neck, knee and shoulder problems restricting him to eight club appearances since the 2012-13 season.

He is out of contract at Leicester this summer and his future in England has been in doubt. The East Midlands club have insisted on a pay cut to reflect the player’s injury record but this latest return to the international set-up could convince Croft to stay put.

Following an abrasive weekend of European action, Croft was last night joined in the squad at Pennyhill Park by Saints lock Christian Day. 

The uncapped forward will provide cover for Geoff Parling, who is expected to be sidelined for four weeks with a knee injury. Bath flanker Carl Fearns and Wasps lock James Gaskell will replace Croft and Day in the Saxons squad for Friday night’s fixture against Ireland Wolfhounds in Cork. 

But there could yet be more additions to the senior Six Nations party over the coming days.

Updates on the fitness of Brad Barritt (knee), Kyle Eastmond (shoulder) and Owen Farrell (knee) are expected this afternoon. 

The latter is a particular concern after he was seen leaving the Stade Marcel-Michelin on Sunday evening on crutches with his left knee strapped in a brace.

‘It’s too early to give any definitive news on their fitness,’ said Lancaster. ‘Tom’s ankle and Owen’s knee have been scanned. Owen sees a specialist and we will then be able to provide an update on him and the other injured players, along with any other potential additions to the squad.’

With England already short on centres, including the notable absence of Manu Tuilagi, Lancaster is confident midfield powerhouse Luther Burrell will be back training on Friday.

But Saracens flanker Will Fraser will play no part in this year’s World Cup plans after he was ruled out for the remainder of the season yesterday morning.

The 25-year-old will undergo surgery on a back problem this afternoon, as confirmed by Mark McCall. The Saracens director of rugby said: ‘It’s obviously disappointing for Will and for us. But it’s obviously in everybody’s interest to sort out these issues once and for all. Will is only 25 and he has plenty of great rugby in him, for club and country.’

While clubs enjoy a rest period from the Aviva Premiership, directors of rugby across the country will turn their focus to recruitment for the 2015/16 season.

Sportsmail understands that Exeter are looking at Springbok scrum half Francois Hougaard as a potential marquee signing and they will keep a close eye on the No 9 when he plays for the Blue Bulls in a friendly match against Saracens on Saturday.

They are not yet able to enter discussions with the 26-year-old because of his contractual agreement to South Africa.

It is understood Exeter will face stiff competition from clubs in France and Japan.

The 27-cap international is one of his country’s highest-profile sportsmen and dated Reeva Steenkamp, the murdered ex- girlfriend of Oscar Pistorius.

Scrum-half reinforcements are high on the shopping list of Exeter director of rugby Rob Baxter, who lost out to Wasps in the battle to sign Gloucester No 9 Dan Robson.

Hougaard can also play on the wing and scored the 2014 IRPA try of the year in the 27-25 victory over New Zealand during the Rugby Championship.
