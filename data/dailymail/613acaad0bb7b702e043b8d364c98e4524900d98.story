Children as young as six are encouraged to attend school daily to see positive NAPLAN results in the long run, according to a new study.

The research found academic achievement on NAPLAN had become worse as attendance rates are high in primary school and fall away sharply during high school.

Students who skip a large amount of school days for family holidays, sick days or general absences may not have the opportunity or resources to catch up on missed classes.

The research - delivered at the Australian Council for Educational Research's annual conference on Monday - found that a small amount of absence from school may have minimal effect on academic performance. But beyond some threshold attendance level, there is noticeable drop in measured academic performance.

Kirsten Hancock, a researcher from Telethon Kids Institute said parents are encouraged to understand the value of regular school attendance for their children.

'Children learn their habits early so if they are taught that they need to 'show up' for school and make that commitment from a young age then they will carry that positive mentality for the years ahead, not only at school but throughout their careers and life generally,' she said.

'We wanted to know how many days of absence kids could 'get away with' before it started to affect how they were doing in at school. The answer was none.

'We also found that the effect of missing days accumulated over time, so that school absence not only impacted in the year, in which the days were missed but in the future years as well.'

Sydney Morning Herald reports the study dispels the common belief there is a safe level of absence students can get away with before their grades will suffer.

'We were able to show that actually every day counts and days that you're missing in year three and year five can detect that all the way through to year nine,' the reports co-author and University of Western Australia Professor Stephen Zubrick said.

'A 10 day period of unathorised absence in a year is sufficient to drop a child about a band in the NAPLAN testing.

'For most children, year one sets the pattern for what school attendance will look like in the future.'

Despite all concerns on school attendance, Cabramatta West Public School teacher Mathew Halloran said the concern with children missing school should be how it affects their total school learning, not just the NAPLAN results, which is a one off test every two years.

'Attendance is important for students' welfare and learning the total curriculum,' he told Daily Mail Australia.
