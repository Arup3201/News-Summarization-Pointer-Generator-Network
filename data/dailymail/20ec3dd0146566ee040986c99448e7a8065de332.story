She married the grandson of the man behind apartheid before scandalising the Afrikaner community when she became a member of the ANC.

Now Melanie Verwoerd, who went on to become an ANC MP and ambassador to Ireland, has penned a memoir of her time with Nelson Mandela - the man she credits with her political transformation.

'I was very worried about meeting him for the first time,' she admits. 'On the night my [now former] 
husband wanted to apologise to Madiba for his family’s 
contribution to Apartheid.

Changing times: Melanie was born into an Afrikaner family during Apartheid but went on to become an ANC MP

Architect: Hendrik Verwoerd was prime minister of South Africa between 1958 and 1966

'But he wouldn't hear of it. He said that the Verwoerd surname could either be a hindrance or a
 blessing in the new South Africa and that we had to think carefully about what we wanted to do with that power.

'That changed my life. After a lot of thinking, I joined the ANC, became an MP and was 
later appointed the South African ambassador to Ireland.'

It was the latest stop in a life that could already be described as extraordinary. Born Melanie van NIekerk in 1967 into a well-heeled Afrikaner family in Pretoria, her childhood was comfortable and happy.

'I grew up like any other white Afrikaner
 girl,' she remembers. 'I only met African people when the worked in our garden or house.

'I went to an all-white school, lived in a white neighbourhood and only 
had white friends. Although we were middle-class, it was a very 
privileged existence in comparison to the majority.'

Later, she went on to study at the prestigious Stellenbosch University, where she met her husband Wilhelm, the grandson of Hendrik Verwoerd - the man widely credited with the invention of Apartheid.

But it would prove to be the last conventional turn her life ever took. In 1985, she and her husband moved to London and there, finally mixing with South Africans from all races, Melanie's political world was turned upside down.

Divisive: Verwoerd was seen as controversial in the UK, attracting protests both for and against his plans

New direction: Melanie and her husband joined the ANC in 1989 after meeting exiles in London in the late 80s

'I first met young South African exiles while 
travelling in London and Oxford at the end of 1985,' she remembers.

'They
 told me about what was happening to them - something I didn't really 
know about before. I was a changed person when I returned to South 
Africa. I started 
reading and questioning everything.'

But when she aired her changing views to her family and friends, their furious reaction and, eventually, complete ostracism, left her saddened.

'The hardest part of it all was the break with the 
Verwoerd family,' she says. 'Wilhelm’s father wouldn't speak to us for more than 10
 years.

'It was hard because we had small children and wanted them to see their grandparents. So I would pass them to my 
mother-in-law over the fence and wait in the car or a coffee shop until one needed to be breastfed and then I would return and she would hand 
them back.'

But worse was to come. After Wilhelm's father publicly denounced his son and daughter-in-law, death threats began to pour in.

Much missed: Melanie says she was devastated when Mandela died but says he is still her moral compass

Work: Melanie also did a stint at UNICEF and is seen here with a Mozambican boy named Lucky

'We were put on a hit list and it was very uncomfortable for a 
while,' says Melanie, almost laconically. 'It was so much less than what others endured.

'Also, I never give in to bullies and threats. Once you do that you will never be
 able to stand up for anything. So it was all worth it 
because what we did was morally the right thing to do.'

Happily for Melanie, times were changing in South Africa and in 1990, the ANC was taken off the banned list.

Four years later, Nelson Mandela and the ANC swept to power - and Melanie, then just 27 years old, with them.

'I was the youngest woman ever to be 
elected,' she beams, 'and it was the most 
extraordinary time.

'To be able to be there when Madiba addressed parliament, to be able to accompany him to 
official engagements... just to be in his presence was simply astonishing.

'It was also a real privilege to play a part in making history, such as when we wrote the final constitution. Not many 
people get to do that.'

And more success was to come even if, sadly, it was at the expense of her marriage which was by now floundering under the strain.

In 2001, she was appointed South Africa's ambassador to the Republic of Ireland, a post which she used to highlight the issue of HIV and AIDS, before stepping down in 2005 as her marriage to Wilhelm finally collapsed.

In 2007, she became Executive Director of UNICEF Ireland and travelled the world promoting the charity before her employment came to an abrupt end following the death of her partner, the Irish radio DJ Gerry Ryan.

Moving on: Melanie is back in South Africa but continues to campaign on women and children's rights

Now back 
in South Africa, she says the world still needs to do more to solve 
issues like violence against women and sexual crimes.

And
 she is working on a series of personal projects too, among them her new
 book, Our Madiba, a collection of touching memories of the iconic South
 African leader, among them her own.

'I last saw him a few years ago at a lunch in Cape Town,' she smiles. 'He waved at
 me to come over which I did and he gave me a big hug.

'He then complained that he was getting old and that the 
young women didn't fancy him anymore so I said, "I still fancy you 
Madiba"!

'He then looked at me with a twinkle in his eye and said, "Yes, 
but you are not so young anymore" and we both burst out laughing. He 
had such a mischievous sense of humour.'

Mandela's death last December left her deeply upset but she says South Africa is a better place because of him.

'I was extremely sad,' she says. 'It felt like I had 
lost a grandfather. We knew that it was coming and didn't 
want him to suffer but it still felt like an enormous loss when he died.

'Our country was a disaster and
 no one other than Madiba and the ANC could have taken us through that very difficult transition with such success,' she continues.

'I wouldn't be so pretentious as to think I 
played any significant role. I just did what I could and what come 
across my road. But Madiba will always be my guiding light and the voice of conscience.'

Melanie's book, Our Madiba, £11.95. is published by Tafelberg and is out now
