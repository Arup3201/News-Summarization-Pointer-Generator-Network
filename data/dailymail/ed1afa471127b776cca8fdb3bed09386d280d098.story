Investigations into the cause of a tunnel collapse that saw nine people die in Japan have revealed  'anchor bolts' used to secure concrete slabs to the ceiling were missing.

The mangled wrecks of cars being carried out of Japan's Sasago Tunnel suggest there was little motorists could do to escape the sudden collapse of the ceiling above them.

At a press briefing yesterday, the executive officer of the tunnel's operator said it appeared that some 'anchor bolts' used to secure concrete slabs to the tunnel ceiling were missing.

'There were parts of concrete (slabs) 
where bolts had fallen off,' Ryoichi Yoshizawa said, according to a 
spokesman for Central Japan Expressway Company or NEXCO-Central.

'The aging of the bolts or the 
concrete slabs could be a potential cause (of the collapse),' Yoshizawa 
said. He did not say how many bolts were found to be missing or how they
came to be loose.

Yoshizawa added that while regular 
checks had been performed on the tunnel, they were visual checks and 
there was no physical testing.

Emergency inspections have been 
ordered on 49 tunnels across the country with the same ceiling 
structure, according to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport 
and Tourism.

There are 1,575 highways tunnels in 
Japan and around a quarter of those are more than 30 years old, 
including the Sasago Tunnel which opened in 1977, the ministry said.

The burned bodies of nine people were pulled from the wreckage of the highway tunnelÂ  on Sunday after its roof fell onto moving vehicles and sparked a fire.

Authorities have confirmed the deaths but said rescue work had to be suspended while the roof was being reinforced to prevent more collapses

The concrete ceiling panels collapsed deep inside the three-mile long Sasago Tunnel, which is around 50 miles west of Tokyo.

Video
footage from cameras inside the tunnel, after the fire was 
extinguished, showed firefighters picking their way through cement roof 
panels that collapsed onto vehicles.

Two vehicles caught fire in the accident and heavy smoke initially hindered rescue efforts.

The location of the accident, about a
mile inside Sasago Tunnel, in Otsuki, Yamanashi Prefecture, was also 
making the work difficult.

Police and the highway operator Central Japan Expressway Co are investigating why the concrete panels collapsed

Jun Goto, an official at the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, said highway operators are carrying out work to support the remaining panels in the ceiling

Police and the highway operator 
Central Japan Expressway Co were investigating why the concrete panels 
collapsed. The size of each panel, how many fell and other details about
the collapse were not immediately released.

The nine dead were traveling in three 
vehicles in the tunnel that links the capital to central Japan. The 
tunnel opened in 1977 and is one of many in the mountainous country.

Two people also suffered injuries in the collapse.

Structural damage: Around 150 concrete panels fell from the roof of the tunnel

Shock: The surprise collapse at the Sasago tunnel has shocked Japan

Search for survivors: A monitoring camera on the Central Nippon Expressway captured the rescue effort

Vital route: The road is one of the most important in the country, linking Tokyo with central Japan

Trapped: Smoke billows from the entrance of the collapsed tunnel on the Chuo expressway

Long haul: Recovery work has been taken place throughout the day and into the evening

Team effort: Rescue workers from police, fire department and highway authorities responded to the emergency
