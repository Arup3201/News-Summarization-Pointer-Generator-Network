A woman set out to prove that females get catcalled no matter what they're wearing created a blog on which women could post the outfits, some mundane, that solicited unwanted attention.

The page titled, 'But What Was She Wearing: Stop the Cat Call' created by Kati Heng documents what girls were actually wearing when harassed on the street-and it may surprise you.

The page seeks to move the blame away from the girl who is often asked 'but what were you wearing' after expressing discomfort after receiving comments from lecherous men.

Casual attire: Amanda Bush says she was called the 'C' word after she didn't acknowledge a man's advances when she was wearing this outfit in a local parking lot 

Many of the women's outfits consist of everyday sweat pants or jeans and modest dresses.

BuzzFeed spoke with Heng that the blog’s aim is to share women’s stories of street harassment without allowing anyone to put the blame on what she wore.

'So often, when women try to talk about the harassment we face, we’re met with that stupid question, ‘What were you wearing?’ as if WE are the ones responsible for what happened to us,' said Heng.

'By having the selfies of what we were wearing upfront, it takes the question away, forcing people to get past it and just read the stories.'

Heng told BuzzFeed that her own personal experiences motivated her to create the page.

'A couple days before I launched, I got catcalled twice in one weekend – the first time, wearing a shorts and a baggy flannel, walking with my boyfriend, some dude yelled out his car to my boyfriend, ‘Hey, I want to f***k your girlfriend!’ That one was really upsetting because I wasn’t even the object of harassment anymore; I was just an object for men to compete over.'

Homophobic remark: Holly Stewart Sanchez Perry says a man on the street told her he hoped she wasn't a lesbian because that would be too bad for men who fancy her

Her story has motivated other girls to come forward with their own and form a sisterhood of women who are saying no to the catcall.

A similar story to this one is the video of 24-year-old aspiring actress who was filmed being catcalled 108 times as she strolled around New York City - even though she was wearing a plain T-shirt, jeans and sneakers.

Shoshana Roberts, a graduate of Kutztown University in Pennsylvania, was captured on a hidden camera by her friend, Rob Bliss, as she walked through the city's streets.

Over a ten-hour period, she was pelted with dozens of unsolicited comments, including: 'What's up beautiful?', 'Hey baby', 'Smile' and 'Have a nice evening darling'.

Roberts along with many other women feel as though their boundaries are being disrespected and no matter what they're wearing feel as though they don't deserve it.

Heng said that she was interested in the ageism of street harassment pointing out that girls under the age of 18 receive 'the worst harassment just because they left school still wearing their school uniforms.'
