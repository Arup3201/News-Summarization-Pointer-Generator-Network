A Good Samaritan van driver is fighting for life in hospital today after being dragged along a motorway by an opportunist thief he had tried to help.

The 28-year-old victim stopped his VW Caddy van after seeing a lorry had overturned on the M602 motorway near Salford, Greater Manchester, at 8.30am yesterday.

He got out on the hard shoulder - leaving his keys in his ignition - and walked over to see if he could help him.

But the lorry driver then jumped in to the man's VW and drove away, prompting the stunned victim to desperately cling on to his van.

Greater Manchester Police revealed the van driver is in a 'critical condition' in hospital with severe head injuries after being dragged 'some distance' down the M602 before falling off.

Detectives are questioning a 43-year-old man, believed to be the lorry driver, on suspicion of attempted murder.

But they are appealing for any eye-witnesses and said the white VW Caddy was driven onto the M60 towards Stockport and remains missing.

A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: 'At around 8.30am on Sunday March 1  a lorry overturned on the Warrington-bound M602 slip road just outside Salford.

'The 28-year-old victim pulled his VW Caddy van over to the hard shoulder, thinking that he would be able to assist the driver of the lorry.

'He left his keys in the ignition as he went to help, only for the lorry driver to jump into his van and drive off, with the victim still clinging to the vehicle.

'The victim was dragged for some distance along the motorway before he fell off and sustained serious head injuries.'

Appeal: Police are yet to find the stolen white VW Caddy, file picture, which has theÂ registration number DY14 FPN

Detective Sergeant Julie Connor from Salford CID said: 'The injured man is in a critical condition at hospital.

'We are keen to trace anyone who witnessed this incident and to recover the stolen VW Caddy van registration number DY14 FPN'.

Anyone with information is asked to call Salford CID on 0161 856 5351 quoting log number 723. Or witnesses can call 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
