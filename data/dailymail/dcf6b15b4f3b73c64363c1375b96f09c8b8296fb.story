Rory McIlroy's course record at Royal Aberdeen lasted just three days as Chile's Felipe Aguilar carded a superb 63 in the final round of the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.

McIlroy's 64 on Thursday had come just two hours after Sweden's Kristoffer Broberg established a new record with a 65 after going out in the first group at 6:30am.

And Aguilar went one better on Sunday morning as he took advantage of the rain-softened course and no wind to fire eight birdies, six of them in seven holes in a front nine of 30.

'It's pretty amazing,' said Aguilar, who won his second European Tour title in Singapore earlier this season with a final round of 62. 'I haven't hit the ball that well since Singapore.

'I hit it really good, made a couple of of long putts and overall it was a really, really good round. I did not get into any trouble and the only green I missed was on the 18th because I went for the flag.

'Finishing like this on this course is a very good way to finish because I was struggling the first three days. The course was a little softer and you could be more aggressive. It probably won't be the only round of eight under.'

England's Justin Rose and Scotland's Marc Warren shared the lead on 10 under par but were not due off until shortly after 3pm.

Meanwhile, McIlroy has been urged to try Castle Stuart for himself after it was confirmed the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open will return there in 2016.

Ahead of competing at Royal Aberdeen this week, McIlroy said that he had not played the Scottish Open in recent years because Castle Stuart - host from 2011 to 2013 - did not provide 'a true links test' in the week before the Open Championship.

The two-time major winner is likely to approve of Sunday's confirmation that a composite course made up from 15 holes of Gullane No 1 and three from Gullane No 2 will host the tournament next year.

But it remains to be seen whether he will change his opinion of Castle Stuart to play there in 2016 ahead of the Open at Royal Troon.

Castle Stuart general manager Stuart McColm said: 'The disappointment for me is that Rory has never been. I don't know how he can say something about a golf course he has never seen.

'Why doesn't he come up there and play it before making up his mind.'

In addition to confirming the venues for the next two years, it was also revealed on Sunday that next year's Scottish Open will be preceded by a new 54-hole qualifying event which will offer six places in the tournament to Scottish golfers.

European Tour chief executive George O'Grady said: 'Together with the Scottish Government and Aberdeen Asset Management, we are delighted to announce Gullane and Castle Stuart as the next two venues for the championship.

'At Gullane we will be treated to one of the game's most historical venues, while Castle Stuart will once again showcase a truly modern links test.'
