Kevin Pietersen scored a blistering 67 not out from just 42 balls as he guided Melbourne Stars to a crushing eight-wicket victory over Sydney Thunder at the Spotless Stadium in the Big Bash League - before taking a veiled dig at former England ODI captain Alastair Cook.

The former England batsman hit one six and 10 fours during his innings in Sydney on Saturday as the away side comfortably claimed victory with more than five overs still remaining, just fours after he was pictured on Bondi Beach sticking his middle finger up at photographers.

The 34-year-old is now the No 1 runmaker in the Big Bash League this year with 281 runs from seven matches and calls will continue for him to return to the England side following another impressive display.

England one-day captain Eoin Morgan even had to deny during the week that he wanted Pietersen to return to the international fold, such is the hype surrounding the South-African born batsman right now. 

After the game, man-of-the-match Pietersen could not help taking a slight dig at  Cook and the England batting line-up that was on display in Sri Lanka.

Pietersen, who gave the finger to a cameraman while he showed off his new tattoo - which displays the venues at which he scored each of his 31 international centuries - when walking along Bondi Beach before the game on Saturday, said: 'I think I'm batting better than I've ever batted. My knee has hampered me since 2013 but I'm finally feeling free.

'I'm just enjoying myself having fun. The batting line-up that (England) have is exciting. One failure does not make them bad.'

Cook played in the England line-up in Sri Lanka but was subsequently sacked as ODI captain and Pietersen took a veiled dig at his former international team-mate. 

Pietersen insisted he will now watch the England line-up - but the side in Sri Lanka, which contained Cook, would not have interested him. 

He added: 'It's (the current England line-up) is one that I'll watch.

'I might not have watched the one in Sri Lanka but I'll watch this one.

'I don't think I made it look easy (out at the crease) but I think the wicket got easier as the nightfall came.

'I think we got the good rub of the green. We won the toss and put them in - I think our bowlers deserve credit. I got runs but they deserve credit.'

Ex-England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff, during commentary for Sky Sports 2, said of Pietersen during the Stars' innings of 107 for two: 'He's getting out the full repertoire here.

'He played well I think from start to finish.

'When you've got that man (Pietersen) playing well, you've got every chance and the Stars are looking like the team to beat (in the Big Bash League this year).' 

The Stars won the toss in Sydney and put Thunder into bat, which turned out to be a brilliant decision.

Michael Beer, Jackson Bird, John Hastings and Clint McKay took two wickets apiece as Thunder were restricted to just 106 for eight from their 20 overs.

Pietersen himself even bowled an over of his occasional off-spin, but he failed to take a wicket and was hit for seven runs.

Jacques Kallis made just four runs for the home side, with Aiden Blizzard top-scoring after hitting 45 off 48 balls. 

In reply, alongside Pietersen's brilliant innings, Cameron White scored 23 and England batsman Luke Wright made just four.

Peter Handscomb made 10 not out and was Pietersen's fellow batsman at the crease when the Stars eased past Thunder's total with 33 balls still remaining.
