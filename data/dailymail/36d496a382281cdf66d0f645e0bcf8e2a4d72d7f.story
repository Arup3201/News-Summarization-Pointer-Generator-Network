A former gunner in the Royal Artillery had his dying wish granted when his ashes were fired from a 19th century cannon.

Derek Chatting was given the unusual send off following a service which was a re-enactment of an 1880s officer's funeral carried out by 20 people at Nothe Fort in Weymouth, Dorset.

Mr Chatting served 24 years in the Royal Artillery, working his way up through the ranks to Warrant Officer Class 2.

He started his military career with the Junior Leaders before joining the 45 Medium Regiment Royal Artillery in 1971.

He was posted to the 52 (Niagara) Battery and in the late 1970s he was eventually promoted to warrant officer.

When he realised he was losing his battle with cancer he told his friends and family how he wanted his ashes to be fired from a cannon rather than scattered.

In July he died aged 59 after suffering from brain and lung tumours for almost four years.

And almost straight away, his former army comrades Kenneth Priestley, Peter Rigby and Nick Mercer started working on how to fulfil his final request.

Mr Chatting served for 24 years in the Royal Artillery and started his career in the 1970s, right, before being promoted to a warrant officer 

Mr Priestley then contacted the Royal Artillery but was told it would cost them £3,000.

After sharing the news with former colleagues on Facebook, it was suggested that they ask at the local fort.

They then got in touch with Paul Merry, who runs the Nothe Fort Artillery Volunteers re-enactment group, who agreed to carry out the stunt.

Mr Priestley explained: 'I went to visit him just after last Christmas. I was chatting to him about how he was feeling and he just came out with it - "I want my ashes fired over Salisbury Plain, Ken."

'I just laughed and said that’s typical of you Derek, wanting the impossible.

'He had been thinking about it ever since he was diagnosed.

'When I contacted the Royal Artillery they weren’t overly happy to do it and they wanted about £3,000.

'On Facebook I asked other ex-servicemen who knew Derek what to do and Peter suggested the fort.

'He got in touch with them and they wanted far less money so we started organising it.

'It was perfect for Derek and his attitude. He kept fighting until the end.'

About 30 family members and former comrades travelled from all over the country to see Mr Chatting’s ashes fired from a six-pounder, smoothbore 1800 cannon in the 30-minute ceremony.

His daughter Leanne Clegg said: 'It was a hard weekend for us because it was the final thing, but it was a nice way to say goodbye.

'He would have been really chuffed with it. He was not the shy and retiring type, I think it would have been really special to him.

'I’m really happy we were able to do what he wanted and it was really touching that all his army friends went to so much effort.'

Around 30 family members and former comrades travelled from all over the country to attend the service including his daughter Leanne Clegg, pictured with her husband Craig, centre 

The cannon is about 60 inches long and has a range of more than 4,500 feet.

It was prepared by putting in a bag of black powder, followed by a bag of Derek’s ashes and then lighting the fuse.

Mr Merry explained: 'When Peter contacted me and asked if it was possible to fire Derek’s ashes from the cannon, I had to look into it and make sure it was still legal.

'Looking back through the records the last ceremony was before the First World War, so it’s been over 100 years.

'People had spoken to us about this sort of thing before, but it never actually got to the point of organising it.

'On the day it wasn’t just a case of me firing the cannon, it was a whole period show. We had 20 re-enactors in full uniform who performed full military honours for Derek.

'We fired his ashes out of the cannon twice, once to start the minute’s silence and once to signify the end and had a bugle playing the last post.

'There were obviously a few tears as the bugle played but his family were really happy with how it went.

'His son and daughter came up to me and said they weren’t expecting so much to be put in.

'For Derek, he was an artillery man and had spent his whole life working with guns. It’s something different but his family said it summed him up completely. He had a good sense of humour.

'They were so chuffed and that was really important to us.'

Since the ceremony, the group have had seven enquiries from families who want to arrange a similar send-off.

Nothe Fort was built between 1860 and 1872 by 26 Company of the Royal Engineers to protect Portland’s harbour, which was then becoming an important Royal Navy base.

It included bomb proof casemates for cannons arranged around the sides, and

played an important role in World War Two, when the harbour was used as base by the British and American navy.

In 1956 the fort was abandoned, and in 1961 it was purchased by the local council. It is now a museum, attracting thousands of tourists each year.
