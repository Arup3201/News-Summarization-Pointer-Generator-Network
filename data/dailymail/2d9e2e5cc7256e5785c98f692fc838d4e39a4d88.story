Luis Suarez's lawyer is confident that the former Liverpool striker's four-month ban will be reduced following an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).

The Uruguay forward was banned for nine international games and all football for four months after biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup - the third time Suarez has been punished for a biting offence.

Despite an appeal being rejected by FIFA last month, Brazilian lawyer Daniel Cravo believes he has a strong case to have the ban reduced after it is heard by the CAS on Friday.

Speaking to Radio Globo, Cravo said: 'I think FIFA wanted to show they could take action.

'There was dissatisfaction with how other incidents had been treated at the World Cup and Suarez paid for them. Not even the sanction of [Zinedine] Zidane in 2006 or those of Leonardo and [Mauro] Tassotti in 1994 were as severe.

'Is the Suarez incident the worst in the history of the World Cup?

'I believe that the sanction which affects his work at a club level will be revoked. There is no precedent in history to justify it.

'I am going to try and reduce his ban with Uruguay -- nine games is too much and would stop him from playing until 2016.

'[The CAS] is totally different and on various occasions in the past they have taken completely different decisions to those which have been taken by FIFA.' 

Wait for it: Suarez completed a £75m move to Barcelona but cannot currently resume playing until October 26

Suarez has since completed a £75 million move to Barcelona and a successful appeal would mean he could start training with his new teammates next week ahead of their opening league game against Elche on Sunday 4 August.

Should Suarez serve his entire ban he would return on October 26, which may coincide with the La Liga's 'el clasico' match between Barcelona and Real Madrid, depending on Spanish broadcaster's scheduling.
