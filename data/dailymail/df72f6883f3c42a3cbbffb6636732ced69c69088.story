A British couple died today when their car was crushed between two lorries in northern France.

The man and woman, both aged 54, had just disembarked from a ferry at the Channel port of Dunkirk.

As they drove towards the main A16 motorway they were involved in the accident at Loon-Plage, said a local police spokesman.

‘The accident happened at around 11.30am,’ he said, adding that nobody involved had yet been identified publicly.

It is thought that one of the lorries stopped suddenly, forcing the couple’s car to brake, and it was then hit by the second lorry, which was registered in Poland.

The Polish truck driver suffered minor injuries, and has told officers that he was unable to stop in time, said the spokesman.

Witnesses said the roads around Dunkirk were 'extremely busy' at the time of the accident (file picture)

Police
said the Polish truck driver was arrested, and was currently in custody.

Both
lorry drivers have been breathalysed but tests for alcohol proved negative, he
said.

The roads
around Dunkirk were said to be ‘extremely busy’ at the time of the accident,
with traffic almost at a standstill in the place where the accident happened.

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: 'We are aware of the death of two British nationals in France.

'We stand ready to provide consular assistance.'
