It was among the most emotional speeches at last year’s Labour Party Conference.

A young anti-crime campaigner, Narraser Gordon, was given a standing ovation from MPs including Tessa Jowell and Yvette Cooper when she movingly told how eight members of her family had been murdered.

But now it has emerged that most of the ‘victims’ the campaigner claimed had died are in fact alive and well.

After Miss Gordon was forced to admit 
using ‘misleading’ words in her speech, Labour officials were criticised
 for not checking her story before she was presented to the conference 
last September.

The 24-year-old, a member of the 
Bristol West Labour Party, took to the stage in Liverpool to address the
 party faithful and accused the Coalition Government of carrying out PR 
stunts rather than tackling the important issues.

She told the audience last September: ‘I am here to talk about why our young people are dying before they can see the age of 21.

‘We are here to challenge young people in asking the important question: Why join a gang, use a gun, or use a knife?’

She continued: ‘This is an issue that 
is causing a huge problem across the UK, including London, Liverpool, 
Nottingham, Birmingham and in my own area Bristol – with eight of my 
family members being murdered there. I am not a celebrity, I am simply a
 young person who has had enough of seeing family members, friends and 
other lives being taken before they can succeed in life.’

In a subsequent newspaper interview, 
Miss Gordon, of Easton, Bristol, gave two examples of genuine victims to
 whom she had links.

One, Leon Plummer, who was stabbed to death in the city in 2002, was her cousin, although the pair had never met.

She said another, 17-year-old Shevon Wilson, who was killed in September 2009, was a friend of hers.

But a BBC current affairs team making a
 documentary about Miss Gordon’s work began investigating her claims to 
have lost eight members of her family to knife and gun crime, and say it
 emerged that most of the people she claimed had been murdered were 
actually alive.

They claim she was also found communicating on Facebook with some of the people she had insisted were dead.

When questioned by the BBC, Miss Gordon admitted that the majority of the people she told them about had not been murdered.

Yesterday she said she ‘may have used words which could be seen as misleading’ and expressed ‘regret’.

She told the regional Inside Out 
programme, broadcast last night on BBC One: ‘I have lost three family 
members and five very close friends who I consider as family.

‘I realise I may have used words which could be seen as misleading and I do regret this.’

She then bizarrely claimed that she 
had changed the names in her story to shield the families of the ‘real’ 
victims, explaining: ‘I do admit that the names originally given to [the
 BBC] were false. This was done to protect the families of my friends 
that I have lost.

‘But I was not corresponding with 
anyone on Facebook, I rarely talk to people on Facebook.’ Miss Gordon, 
who met Labour leader Ed Miliband when he came to Bristol after last 
summer’s riots, stood for the party during the 2011 local council 
elections.

She was said to be in London yesterday and is currently working on a campaign calling for more funding for community activists.

Last night Phil Gaskin, regional 
director of Labour South West, said: ‘She has not been suspended and we 
will not be making any further comment on the matter.’

The ‘star’ of the same Labour party conference at which Miss Gordon spoke last year was 16-year-old Rory Weal.

The schoolboy was feted as a ‘hero’ after his impassioned speech telling how the welfare state saved his family from ruin.

But the Daily Mail revealed that he 
was actually the privileged  son of a millionaire property developer, 
and attended private school until his father’s business went bust.
