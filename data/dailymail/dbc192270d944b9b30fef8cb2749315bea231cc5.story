Gareth Southgate has prioritised holding talks with Mauricio Pochettino in a bid to resolve the uncertainty around Harry Kane’s summer schedule.

Southgate has stepped up preparations for Euro 2015 this week, taking his Under 21 squad to Olomouc — where they will be based during the finals in June.

On Friday they face the Czech Republic here in Prague. The FA have been meticulously planning their assault on the tournament and Southgate has the backing of Roy Hodgson to take his strongest possible squad available, including Kane.

But the Tottenham striker’s situation is complicated by his club’s plans to play a money-spinning friendly in Australia at the end of the Premier League campaign, while Sportsmail revealed on Thursday they could also play in Malaysia, too. 

It has led to fears that Kane, who scored eight goals in 10 games for the Under 21s in qualifying, would be exposed to burnout if he is then made to go on to the Czech Republic. 

But Southgate plans to meet for talks with Spurs manager Pochettino, saying: ‘The situation with me and Mauricio is good and I have had a (text) exchange with Harry, so I think that situation is good as well.

‘At some point, there needs to be a visit, when we say “Ok, what is the plan?”. But I am relaxed about the situation. We have got a really good relationship with Tottenham and with Harry.

‘Mauricio has been very good. He was asked the question “would you like him to rest?” He replied “yes, but” — and the “but” bit has now gone from the debate. I know Mauricio was really proud to play for Argentina and the experiences I have had with him at Tottenham and Southampton is that he has always been really supportive of his international players.

‘As well as that, every quote I have seen from Harry (about playing for the Under 21s this summer) has been very positive.’

Southgate still has a dilemma over Ross Barkley, however. He has not played for the Under 21s since August 2013 and Everton would prefer him to rest this summer after a disappointing season. Barkley was under consideration for this trip, but the midfielder stayed with the senior party.

‘I do feel the situation with Ross is different to that of Harry, John Stones and Luke Shaw, as he has never been in one of my squads,’ added Southgate.

‘I was pleased to see Ross named in the senior squad.

‘With Ross not always in Everton’s starting team I think it was important this time round for Roy to back him and keep him involved.

Hopefully that gives Ross some belief in what the England set up think of him and his potential.’
