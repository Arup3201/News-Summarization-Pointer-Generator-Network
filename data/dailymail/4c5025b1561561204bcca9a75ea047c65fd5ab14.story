A mother is furious after her 15-year-old daughter came home from school crying with a chopped off ponytail of her once waist-length hair in her hands. 

That's all because of a friendly bet between a high school coach and a wrestler leading to the coach's suspension and a police investigation in Hawaii.

Carla Fontes, 15, hadn't cut her hair since intermediate school, but her coach at Waiakea High School, Stan Haraguchi, thought the locks flowing below her waist were interfering with the sport.

They bet if she lost a match, he would cut her hair. After a 3-0 start, Fontes lost her first match last week.

Cut it out!: Arlette Fontes holds a ponytail of her daughter, Carla Fontes' hair, that was cut off by Carla's wresting coach Stan Haraguchi during a practice at Waiakea High School as part of a bet 

Chopped; Carla Fontes agreed to have her hair cut by her coach as part of a bet and while she wishes she still had her hair she's said, 'it is what it is' and will continue to wrestle 

'Coach thinks it was hard for me to wrestle with my hair long,' Fontes said in an interview on Wednesday.

'When we wrestle in a match, we wear hair nets.'

She allowed the coach to cut her hair at a team meeting Monday, even though Fontes' mother had expressly forbidden it. Fontes said she didn't relay that information to Haraguchi.

The coach has been suspended, said Donalyn Dela Cruz, spokeswoman for the state Department of Education.

Arlette Fontes was furious when her 15-year-old daughter came home with shoulder-length hair.

'I'm shaking,' the mother told Hawaii Tribune-Herald .

'My daughter's hair went all the way down her butt before. Now it looks like a rat has been nibbling on it. That's a piece of her, gone. A piece of her body.'

Carla Fontes said she loves wrestling and wants the sport to lead to a college scholarship.

'It lets me take some of my anger out,' she said of wrestling. She said she wishes that her hair wasn't cut, 'but it is what it is.'

Haraguchi declined to comment.

Suspended: Stan Haraguchi is suspended from his coaching job at Waikea High School because he cut his student's hair in a bet without her mother's permission  

'In any educational situation, it is always best practice to receive parent consent before making any decision that directly affects a student, especially in a situation like this,' Principal Kelcy Koga said in an email.

Arlette Fontes said she will pursue charges against Haraguchi. Hawaii County police said the department started an investigation Tuesday.

'I told her no, I’m your parent, I didn’t give him the parental right to do that,' Arlette Fontes said.

'No one’s going to cut my baby’s hair.'

Carla Fontes admitted she didn’t tell her coach that her mother wouldn't allow her to get her hair chopped off.

'I told him it was OK, as long as it was not too short,' Carla Fontes said.

According to Carla Fontes' aunt Roberta, Carla was crying when she got home from school.

'I asked her, "What happened?" and she said, "Coach cut my hair,"' Roberta Fontes said. 'I couldn’t believe it.'

Roberta then called her sister who was furious to hear that her daughter’s hair had been cut by the coach.

'I was still working. My sister called me frantic. She said, "Arlette, you don’t know what he did!" I said "What, sis?" She said, "He cut off all her hair!" I said, "What?!" I kind of had an indication from the weekend, but I didn’t think he would follow through on Monday,' the girl’s mother Arlette Fontes said.

Carla Fontes may have been a little upset that her long dark hair now only reaches her shoulders but she thinks the whole thing has been blown out of proportion.

'Our team really pushed a lot,' she said, adding that she thinks Haraguchi is a good coach.
