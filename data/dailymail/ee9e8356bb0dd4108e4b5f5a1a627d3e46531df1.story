Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is making good on his promise to sue the Obama administration over what he calls 'precisely the kind of overreach we fought a revolution over.' His targets are the National Security Agency, the FBI and other federal government offices that snoop on private communications at home and abroad.

With former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli as his lead attorney, Paul filed suit Wednesday morning in Washington, D.C. federal court along with the conservative FreedomWorks organization.

'There's a huge and growing swell of protest in this country,' Paul said during a Wednesday morning press conference, 'of people who are outraged that their records would be taken without suspicion, without a judge's warrant, and without individualization.'

The legal action, officially titled 'Rand Paul v. Barack Obama,' hit the court running with at least 350,000 plaintiffs, according to a source close to the process. Paul is aiming for 10 million, judging from a message on two websites run by his political staff.

'When we learned that the NSA was collecting the phone data of every American last year,' the senator said in a video message Tuesday night to supporters, 'it posed a serious Constitutional question: Do we no longer have a Fourth Amendment?'

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO AND THE LAWSUIT

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul held up cell phones to demonstrate the prime qualification for joining his federal lawsuit against the president. It 'could conceivably represent hundreds of millions of people who have phone lines in this country,' he said

'Libertarian rock star': Rand Paul is solidifying his base through a class-action lawsuit aimed at cornering the political market on Libertarian objections to the NSA. He said in a video message to supporters that his lawsuit would ferret out the broad 'general warrants' over which the early American colonists fought the British crown

Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli couldn't capture the governor's mansion in November, but he's committed to the anti-NSA lawsuit, sources close to the legal process say

The lawsuit argues that the president 'has publicly refused to stop a clear and continuing violation of the Fourth Amendment,' Paul said in a statement from his political action committee. 'I expect this case to go all the way to the Supreme Court and I predict the American people will win.'

Wednesday morning he insisted that 'ultimately,the Supreme Court will be [the] arbiter of what the Fourth Amendment means.' And he predicted that his lawsuit 'could conceivably represent hundreds of millions of people who have phone lines in this country.'

President Obama is named as a defendant, along with Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, Director of the National Security Agency Gen. Keith Alexander, and FBI Director James Comey.

In a statement, the Justice Department defended the NSA's broad data collection, saying that 'we remain confident that the program is legal, as at least 15 judges have previously found.'

Caitlin Hayden, the White House National Security Council Staff spokesperson, told MailOnline that 'we believe the program as it exists is lawful.'

The NSA program, Hayden said, 'receives oversight from all three branches of government, including the Congress. More generally, the president believes that we should to take steps to give the American people more confidence that their privacy and civil liberties are being safeguarded.'

Sen. Paul, son of the former Texas congressman and frequent presidential candidate Ron Paul, is attracting attention with an unusual blend of Libertarian policy that hat-tips social conservatism at every turn

Obama said during a lengthy January 17 speech about U.S. signals intelligence gathering – an oration that might be a preview of the government's courtroom defense – that 'the men and women of the intelligence community, including the NSA, consistently follow protocols designed to protect the privacy of ordinary people.'

'They're not abusing authorities in order to listen to your private phone calls or read your emails,' the president insisted.

His press secretary, Jay Carney, followed up ten days later with assurance during a daily briefing that 'to the extent that the NSA collects information, it is focused on valid foreign intelligence targets and not the information of ordinary Americans.'

'Look,' he told reporters, 'I mean, terrorists, proliferators, other bad actors use the same communication tools that others use.'

Other Democrats who are unsympathetic to Paul's position have been more crass about it.

Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell told The Washington Times on Wednesday that the lawsuit just made him 'look like a petty politician.'

'Obviously the strategy is to appeal to the base,' Rendell said. 'Rand Paul obviously thinks he has a leg up now with [New Jersey] Gov. [Chris] Christie’s problems. He wants to show the base he’s a fighter, that’s what suing the president is all about.'

But as Paul swings hard at Obama, other potential 2016 GOP contenders are softening on the NSA.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio told the Tampa Bay Times on Wednesday that, 'Certainly we should need protect America’s privacy expectations and privacy rights, but we also need an effective surveillance capability.'

He worried aloud about 'five different organizations that brand themselves as al-Qaeda who every single day plot to attack our interests and our allies and even the homeland. We need to have surveillance capabilities to identify them. And we need to be careful about weakening those.'

Sen. Paul's objection focuses on the so-called bulk phone-record 'metadata' that the NSA gathers routinely. The data includes phone numbers, dates, times, and the durations of calls.

National security analysts say the massive tranches of data can be helpful when terrorism suspects are identified, because they allow investigators to establish who they have been talking to – and when.

Instigator: Edward Snowden, a former NSA contract employee, absconded with millions of records and leaked them to The Guardian newspaper, exposing secretive government snooping programs that Sen. Paul is suing to eliminate

Paul's legal advisers thought about filing suit in a Kentucky federal court, MailOnline's source said, but decided on Washington, D.C. because its judges are accustomed to sifting through the thorny issues surrounding whether a class-action group deserves to be 'certified'–if, that is, its members have standing to sue.

He plans a press conference in front of the federal courthouse on Wednesday morning to boast that he's protecting the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment from the White House's national security apparatus.

'The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated,' that Amendment reads in part.

The senator first forecast his legal action in late December, and told the Fox News Channel that since the Obama administration 'has used the IRS to go after people ... we wonder if they would use the NSA that way.'

'Everybody who has a cellphone would be eligible' to become a plaintiff, he said.

That interview came on the same day the NSA convinced a top-secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act judge to green-light its metadata collection for a new 90-day period.

That program, the subject of worldwide leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, has won reauthorization at least 36 times during the past seven years.

Paul's odd mix of libertarian crusade and conservative button-pushing isn't new, and it might become the norm on the right as more Republicans try to find common ground between what amount to warring cousins.

Scene of the crimes? This NSA  eavesdropping facility in the Appalachian mountains, code-named Timberline, is reportedly used for domestic and international surveillance, including intercepting private phone calls. It's inside the National Radio Quiet Zone, a 13,000 square mile area where wireless communications like radios, cell phones, and wi-fi are severely restricted

'Libertarian, or liberty, doesn’t mean libertine,' the GOP presidential hopeful told a red-meat right-wing crowd at a D.C. gala last week.

'To many of us,' he said, playing deftly to a room full of social conservatives, 'Libertarian means freedom and liberty. But we also see freedom needs tradition.'

Matt Kibbe, who leads the influential right-wing Freedomorks organization, is managing the list of plaintiffs for Sen. Paul. His group is also a co-plaintiff

The speech came an hour after a lobbyist was heard introducing him to friends during a pre-dinner reception as a 'Libertarian rock star.'

But Paul cautioned that 'I don’t see libertarianism as, "you can do whatever you want".'

Now the federal legislator is applying that message to the executive branch of government, and hoping the judicial branch will see things his way.

But while his lawsuit percolates, Freedomworks president Matt Kibbe will manage the plaintiff-lists and turn them into a political mobilizing tool.

'If you use a phone, you should care about this case,' Kibbe said Tuesday, adding that his group's 6 million members stand behind the legal effort.

Names are initially collected on websites run by PaulPAC, the Kentucky senator's Political Action Committee, and by his political campaign – presumably one now engaged in planning for the 2016 presidential race.

Both websites ask Web surfers to 'sign below and join my class-action lawsuit and help stop the government's outrageous spying program on the American people.'

They also ask for donations.

'After you sign up, please make a generous donation to help rally up to ten million Americans to support my lawsuit to stop Big Brother,' a message reads.
