A pensioner was killed as he tried to protect an 87-year-old paedophile from a criminal he had apparently met in prison, it was claimed yesterday.

The man rushed to the aid of his neighbour Francis Cory-Wright, an Old Etonian, after he heard him being attacked in his £1million house.

Villagers said the neighbour, in his sixties, was stabbed and had his throat cut after he went to Cory-Wright’s detached house by the village green in Little Gaddesden near Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire.

Police described it as an attack of  ‘significant violence’.

Yesterday they were searching for Ian
McLoughlin, 55, a convicted murderer who is thought to have been 
recently released from the same jail as Cory-Wright, who worked as a 
Lloyd’s underwriter.

Cory-Wright came out of prison eight 
months ago after serving a 30-month sentence for indecently assaulting a
ten-year-old boy 35 years ago.

Ian John McLoughlin, who police would like to speak to in connection with a murder investigation which has been launched after a man in his 70s died following a 'serious incident'

McLoughlin, who has  convictions for 
killing two gay men, is thought to have met Cory-Wright as he was 
serving a life sentence for the second of those killings.

His neighbour is believed to have been 
enjoying the sunshine outside his detached home, also valued at 
£1million, on Saturday afternoon when he heard Cory-Wright calling for 
help.

A neighbour said: ‘Cory-Wright was shouting “help, help” and his neighbour rushed over to the house.’

The Good Samaritan is thought to have been confronted by his attacker, who then dragged him into the kitchen before killing him.

The neighbour said: ‘He was stabbed and his throat was slit. It might have been a knife from the kitchen, I don’t know.

‘Another chap, who was second on the scene, ended up cradling the neighbour in his arms as he died. It’s just awful.’

Another resident said Cory-Wright 
walks with a stick, and added: ‘Apparently the next-door neighbour, who 
himself is aged in his sixties, heard the commotion and went to help the
frail old man and has paid for his good deed with his life. He was 
stabbed and left to die.

‘I have been told that the attacker 
was a man who was serving time with Mr Cory-Wright at the same jail. It 
seems he was unhappy with him and, when he was released, turned up on 
his doorstep.’

McLoughlin is believed to have fled from the home clutching bundles of £50 and £20 notes.

The victim was pronounced dead at the
scene. Cory-Wright was taken to hospital with injuries described by 
police as non-life threatening.

Cory-Wright had been in prison for attacking a ten-year-old boy on a canal bank in Berkhamsted in  the 1970s.

The Oxford graduate, whose 
grandfather Sir Arthur Cory-Wright was High Sheriff of Hertfordshire, 
indecently assaulted his victim after taking him for rides in his 
vintage car.

The victim kept the attack secret for
decades because he did not want his father to find out. But when his 
father died he told police and Cory-Wright was arrested.

At his trial the jury heard that he had also served four months for a sex assault on a 13-year-old boy in a garden shed in 1979.

Detective Chief Inspector Jerome Kent said: 'Whilst the investigation is still in its early stages, we are treating the death as murder'

Police yesterday warned the public 
that McLoughlin, who also uses the surname Baker, was ‘very dangerous’ 
and should not be approached.

Detective Chief Inspector Martin 
Brunning, who is leading the investigation by Bedfordshire, 
Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: ‘We urgently 
want to speak to Ian McLoughlin in connection with this offence.’

In 1983 McLoughlin killed a  
49-year-old gay man who had previously served time for having under-age 
sex. McLoughlin was convicted of manslaughter after Len Delgatty was 
found strangled and drowned in his own blood with his skull smashed with
a hammer.

In 1990, after being released from 
prison, McLoughlin killed his landlord, Peter Halls, in Brighton. It is 
believed the two men were having a sexual relationship.

McLoughlin, who is described as 
‘astonishingly bright’ with an IQ of 140, spent much of his youth in 
juvenile care homes and, it is claimed, worked as a rent boy.
