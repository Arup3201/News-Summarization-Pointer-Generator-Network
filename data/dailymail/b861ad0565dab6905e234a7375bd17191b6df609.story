Just a week after Australian-born ginger jihadist Abdullah Elmir appeared in a propaganda video released by Islamic State, the teenager has resurfaced in another.

The 17-year-old, who grew up in Bankstown in Sydney's west, is seen in the latest video on the banks of the river Tigris, surrounded by dozens of men dressed in black wielding weapons.

The production, titled An Evening On The Banks Of The Tigris River In The Province Of Nineveh In The Islamic State, is more than six minutes long and shows throngs of militants praying and chanting.

Opening on scenes of men  in groups and cleansing in the Tigris River, the piece shows others praying in lines inside what could be a tent, weapons still strapped to their chests.

Throughout the piece  various men address the group, reciting chants they appear to be reading from some sort of script. At other times the men are shown sharing a meal together as they cross the river in a barge.

Those listening will then repeat parts of the chant back at the speaker, and it is one of these scenes that Abdullah Elmir appears.

The teenager is wearing the same black and white keffiyeh he was seen in the previous video, and is flanking a man speaking to the group.

At some points the teenager, who grew up in Bankstown in Sydney's west, appears to stifle a smile or laughter

At one point Elmir seems to stifle a smile or laughter as he looks down, away from the camera while repeating a chant.

His eyes dart around as he listens to one of the other militants speak, and the video looks to have been produced to exhibit comradery and unity of the Islamic State fighters.

While most of the video is in Arabic, The Australian report that some of the speakers said in the footage they will: ' will strike the necks of the infidel and Arab countries'. 

This comes after the government said they would be willing to work with young Australians who had gone to fight in the Middle East but changed their minds before entering battle. 

Just last week Elmir appeared in a chilling video where he condemned Barack Obama and Tony Abbott

A spokeswoman for the Attorney General George Brandis told the publication they wanted 'impressionable youth' to be able to work with Australian authorities, but more serious offenders would be prosecuted back home. 

Earlier this week reports Elmir could face 25 years behind bars should he ever return to Australian soil emerged.

AFP counterterrorism head Neil Gaughan told the Herald Sun that Elmir, who now goes by the moniker Abu Khaled, has 'basically admitted he is a member of a proscribed terrorist organisation'.

In the latest footage Elmir is seen in the same keffiyeh as last week's and is still clutching a large gun

'The fact that he is admitting that he is a member of ISIS, which he does in the video, straight away says that he has committed an offence under the criminal code. That’s up to 25 years imprisonment,' he said.

Professor Greg Barton, from Monash University's Global Terrorism Research Centre, said Elmir was recruited by another wanted terrorist, Mohammad Ali Baryalei, an Australian based in Syria.

He said terror recruiters lured targets by making friends through social media, like many sexual predators.

He said the boy appeared as a 'pawn in the machine' in the first chilling video. 

This comes as Australian authorities have warned that anyone returning from fighting overseas will be thrown in jail back home
