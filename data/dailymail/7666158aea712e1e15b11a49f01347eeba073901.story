The kitten born with two faces has tragically died after barely living to the age of just two days.

Nash Hand and Amelia Forsythe, of Port Charlotte, Florida, named him Harvey Dent after the character’s Two-Face alter-ego in Batman. But the little boy died from complications last Wednesday.

The couple were initially shocked to see one of Nene’s litter had not one but two meowing faces and decided to give the cat a chance despite criticism that it might be cruel to keep such an animal alive.

‘They simultaneously work together, 
the two faces,’ Ms Forsyth told ABC affiliate WWSB. ‘When he eats on one
side, it looks like he is eating on the other. When he meows, it comes 
out of both sides.’

The couple took to classified ads 
website Craigslist to see if there was anyone who could offer advice on 
such an unusual cat. But the responses they received were less than 
friendly.

'They said I should put it down 
because it's an abomination… that I'm an evil person because I would let
such a thing live like that,’ Ms Forsythe told WWSB.

She added: 'It shouldn’t be killed 
just because it’s a little different'.

Despite the financial concerns, 
the couple did want to keep and raise the cat.

The kitten, called a Janus cat named after the two-faced Roman god, is also known as a diprosopus cat.

According to a vet last week, Harvey 
Dent was lucky and didn’t have any noticeable health problems in his 
lungs or heart, though many do because of underlying health problems.

The eldest Janus cat beat the odds and is now 12 years old, according to Guinness World Records.

In Christopher Nolan's 2008 
blockbuster film The Dark Knight, Harvey Dent is played by Aaron 
Eckhart, once a clean-cut district attorney.

After half his face was burned beyond 
recognition by the Joker, he became Two-Face, a crazed man who judges 
the fate of people by the simple flip of a coin.
