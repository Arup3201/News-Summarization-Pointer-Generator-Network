When James Corden was surprisingly chosen to host America’s top chat show, fans and critics alike wondered if the British star would flourish in such an unfamiliar role.

Yet Corden’s first week in the hot-seat on CBS’s The Late Late Show has been so widely acclaimed that he is now being tipped as a front-runner to host the prestigious Golden Globes awards next year – the Hollywood party second only to the Oscars for star quality.

‘Out of nowhere, he’s suddenly a realistic contender for one of the most coveted awards-hosting jobs of the year,’ said a source close to the Globes. ‘He’s only been hosting The Late Late Show for a few days, but already Hollywood is sitting up and taking notice.

‘James has shown that he’s funny, can sing and dance, puts celebrities at their ease, and doesn’t dismiss stars with snark.

‘If he maintains this trajectory, he could find himself hosting the Globes – and that would really cement his position in Hollywood.’

Corden, 36, who made his name as co-writer and star of cult television sitcom Gavin and Stacey, has already proved his ability to host a major awards show by fronting the Brits for four years.

If he took on the Globes, he would be following in the footsteps of fellow comedy actor Ricky Gervais, who hosted the ceremony from 2010 to 2012. Since Gervais stepped down, the awards have been co-hosted by American TV comedy stars Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.

A source within the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which stages the Golden Globes, said: ‘Amy and Tina have finished their three-year contract and have stated that they won’t be back next year.

‘Right now, the field for a new Golden Globes host is wide open.’

Another insider said: ‘James Corden combines all the attributes of the ideal host.

‘He has enjoyed movie success this year, starring in Into The Woods with Meryl Streep, and of course he’s had TV success in Britain with his comedies.

‘He’s also won a Tony for his Broadway show One Man, Two Guvnors, and now he’s getting rave reviews in the States with The Late Late Show, giving him an international audience.’

While there are a string of chat show hosts who are better known in America, such as David Letterman, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel and Ellen DeGeneres, none has Corden’s wide range of film, TV and stage success.

Corden’s guests during his debut week included actors Tom Hanks, Mila Kunis, Will Ferrell, Chris Pine and Kevin Hart. Celebrities lined up for future shows include X Factor tycoon Simon Cowell, footballer David Beckham, chef Gordon Ramsay and actors Michael Douglas, Courteney Cox and Claire Danes.

But not everyone might welcome Corden as the Globes host. He sparked controversy at the Brits in 2012 when he cut short Adele’s acceptance speech for winning the Best British Album after only 12 seconds, provoking a vulgar hand gesture from the angry singer.

Theo Kingma, president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, said: ‘We are exploring some very exciting possibilities regarding hosts.’

A spokesman for Corden declined to comment.
