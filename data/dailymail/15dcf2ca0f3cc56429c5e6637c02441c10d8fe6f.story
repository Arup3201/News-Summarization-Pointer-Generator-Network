Everyone from the Eagles hierarchy to the dugout are on board with the idea of bringing Cole back to Selhurst Park.

Palace will be kept updated on Cole's situation going into the January transfer window.

'I was asked the question if I would like Ashley Cole and the answer is yes I would,' said Warnock.

'But (having spoken to Cole's representatives) there is no way he is going to come away from Italy this season.
