Two of the 'regular New Yorkers' featured in the latest Anthony Weiner campaign video have worked for the mayoral candidate.

The 30-second TV advert, released today, features four people from four of the city's boroughs, who explain why they plan to support Weiner.

What two of them didn't mention on camera however, was that they worked as interns for the candidate's election campaigns, the Daily News reported.

Watch the campaign video

Support: Weiner intern Joel Acevedo appears in the mayoral candidate's latest campaign advert

Backing: Mary Elizabeth Elkordy worked as an unpaid fundraiser for Anthony Weiner in 2008

First to appear in the video is fresh-faced Joel Acevedo, who says: 'An an 18-year-old, first time voting, I decided to vote for the future of New York.'

However, the Staten Island student is a current unpaid intern on Weiner's election team. He lists his current employment on LinkedIn as Macy's and 'Anthony Weiner for Mayor', according to the Daily News.

The advert also features Queens resident Mary Elizabeth Elkordy, who says 'no other candidate really talks about the middle class'.

She added that if other candidates did speak about them, 'it’s only because Anthony Weiner came into this race'.

What isn't mentioned is that Ms Elkordy worked as a fundraising intern for Weiner, from December 2008 to June 2009, when he was in Congress. 

Campaign spokesman Barbara Morgan said none of the people featured in the advert had ever been paid by Weiner.

'They are all real live supporters who have chosen Anthony Weiner,' she added.

The advert is the first to feature New Yorkers coming out to back Weiner since his sexting revelations, that have taken the frontrunner in the mayoral race to bottom of the polls.

One of them, Mary Love from the Bronx, is filmed stating: 'You're personal life don't reflect on your working life'.
