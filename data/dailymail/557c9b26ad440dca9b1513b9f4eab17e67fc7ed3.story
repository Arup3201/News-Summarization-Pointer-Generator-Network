A hundred ho-ho-hos: Ron Horniblew, or Santa Ron, has been bringing festive cheer to Luton since 1964

The ever-changing face of the Santa Claus at department store grottoes is almost enough to kill the myth.

But 77-year-old Ron Horniblew is keeping the magic alive for Britain as the country's longest-serving Father Christmas.

Santa Ron, as he is known, has been bringing festive cheer to Luton every Christmas for the last 48 years, and has
won awards for his superb Santa skills.

Mr Horniblew first put on his red suit to deliver his son's Christmas presents back in 1964.

He enjoyed it so much he began playing Santa for his friend's children too, before moving into grottoes and using his jolly demeanour to raise money for charity.

During his years of service, Santa Ron has heard hundreds of thousands of children's Christmas lists, delivered hundreds of sacks of presents and raised thousands of pounds for charity.

He has visited children at an orphanage in the Bahamas, attended Santa conferences and competitions in Sweden, Norway and Denmark and was crowned the World's Best Santa in 2004.

In recognition of his dedication to Christmas, Mr Horniblew has been awarded a 40-Year-Service award and is one of the only Britons entitled to wear the official Santa badge, after being authorised by Santa Claus of Greenland.

He said: 'I started dressing up as Santa when my son Graham was young, friends of mine then asked if I could come round and visit their children and it just snowballed from there.

'I just loved seeing the surprise and happiness I could bring to people.

'On Christmas morning I visit lots of different families I leave around 7.30 in the morning and I'm home in time for my Christmas dinner at 2.30 in the afternoon.

'During my Christmas visits, I arrive ringing my bell, the parents usually leave the presents in the porch or on the doorstep for me and I put them in my sack and deliver them to the children.

'To see the look on their faces when I arrive is wonderful, I spend time chatting to the children and pose for photos with the family.

'It just makes Christmas morning that little bit more magical, when I leave the house and everyone is smiling it makes it all worthwhile.

'I really enjoyed competing in the competitions, I have both a bronze and a gold medal. And being named World's Best Santa was a proud moment.

'The highlight of my career has to be seeing the smiles on the faces of the children I visited at an orphanage in the Bahamas.

'They were the most fantastic children I've ever came across, they were so loving and appreciative.'

Despite admitting he is now a little old to compete in the competitions, Santa Ron still refuses to be photographed without his suit on and continues to visit children on Christmas day and help raise money for his local church.

He has now opened his own Santa school in the hope of continuing his legacy by teaching others how to become the perfect Santa.

He said: 'I take my job as Santa very seriously, it isn't just about dressing up in a red suit and saying Ho Ho Ho!

'Being Santa is about about listening to the children and making them feel special.

Time for a mince pie! Santa Ron delivers gifts to his delighted neighbours Margaret and Peter

'You have to be as excited and enthusiastic with the last child you see on a day as you were with the first. It's important you don't wain.

'It's jolly hard work you have to make sure each child leaves thinking Father Christmas is wonderful.

'A good Santa mustn't use bad language and should never smoke or drink in their suit, there's nothing worse than a smelly Santa.

'They should always look their best and be a jolly good listener.

'I'm hoping to launch officially next year, I have a lot of experience to pass on and it would be nice to train others to continue my legacy.'
