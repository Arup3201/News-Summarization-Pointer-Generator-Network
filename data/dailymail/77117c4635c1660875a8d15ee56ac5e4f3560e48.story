Students can wave goodbye to being driven to university by embarrassing parents in an overloaded car  – and pay to arrive in style instead.

Launching on Monday, The Very Important Fresher package offers those with the budget the option to travel to campus by helicopter, private jet, Ferrari or Aston Martin.

Other luxury options include a Rolls Royce Phantom, Mclaren P1 – and even a horse and carriage - which will set buyers back up to £25,000.

Arrive in style: Travelling for the first day of uni by private jet will set freshers back £25,000

'First class impression': Students wanting to arrive at campus in an Aston Martin will pay £15,000

The service offers freshers the chance to make a ‘first class impression’ and ‘an entrance enviable of movie stars or premiership footballers’.

Designed by delivery specialist Uni Baggage, the high-end package aims to provide an ‘action-packed James Bond-style expedition across the country’. 

Paul Stewart, co-founder of Uni Baggage said: ‘The aspirations of students are continually changing and the need to make that all important first class impression is more paramount than ever.

First impressions: A trip to uni in a Rolls Royce Phantom will cost £15,000 in the new Very Important Fresher

High-speed entrance: Arriving to uni in a Ferrari F430 will cost a fresher £15,000

‘We’re excited to be answering this demand by launching the UK’s first luxurious travel service for the students of today.’

The company will also transport students’ belongings separately – as well as pack and unpack them at the fresher’s new pad, which is included in the cost.

The VIF package, believed to be the first of its kind in the country, is launching on Monday. 

However, the service doesn’t come cheap – with prices ranging from £10,000. 

The most expensive mode of transport students can book to arrive at campus in is the private jet - at a wallet-busting £25,000.

'Inspired by Downton Abbey': A trip to campus in a horse and cart will cost £10,000

The package - for those with the cash to spare - means no more trips with parents and overloaded cars

The helicopter entrance costs £20,000, the Mclaren P1 £18,000 and the Rolls Royce Phantom, the Ferrari F430 and Aston Martin £15,000.

For those with less cash to splash, arranging to arrive at university by horse and carriage will set them back £10,000.

Mr Stewart added: ‘The Uni Baggage service is an ideal alternative for students who would usually have to haul their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.

‘Paired with our new VIF options, we’re looking forward to ensuring this year's students reach university with minimum fuss and maximum luxury.

‘We are stepping up the game, we are changing the way students travel to university and from September we will be offering the UK's first luxury student transport service.’
