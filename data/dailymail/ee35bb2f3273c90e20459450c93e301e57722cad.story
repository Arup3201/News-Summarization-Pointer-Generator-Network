A Victorian law used to imprison pranksters who played 'knock down ginger' has been brought back into use to arrest and fine dangerous rickshaw drivers in London.

The 173-year-old Metropolitan Police Act prevents anyone 'riding or driving furiously such as to endanger the life or limb of any person' and officers have impounded more than 100 of the pedi-cabs using it.

Section 54 of this act, made law in, also outlaws 'wantonly disturbing people by ringing doorbells', an act carried out by most Britons in their lifetime, which was punishable by 14 days in prison nearly two centuries ago.

Any 'nuisances by Persons in Thoroughfares', 'singing of any obscene songs and ballads' as well as excessive blowing of horns or dangerous kite flying can also be stopped using the law.

Details released under the Freedom of Information today show the Met stopped 534 rickshaw drivers in London in the three-month period between January and March.

Police are cracking down on them as many motorists and pedestrians have been put in danger by reckless rickshaw drivers.

Battle: Chief Supt Simon Ovens, who is in charge of policing the West End, wants rickshaws removed completely

From that a total of 101 rickshaws were impounded and 53 drivers were fined £80, new figures reveal.

Chief Supt Simon Ovens, who is in charge of policing London's West End, where the majority of these rickshaws are, said: 'I would like to see them taken off the road altogether. They put passengers at risk — particularly passengers who have had too much to drink — and the drivers are unqualified.'

The local council also has pledged to get tough on them.

Cllr Ed Argar, Westminster City Council’s cabinet member for city management and transport, said: 'Just a few pedicabs blocking the footway or road or travelling carelessly can have a huge effect on traffic congestion in the busiest part of London and put all road users' lives in danger.

'Westminster City Council demands that the pedicab industry improves standards and safety, and has been working for several years with the better sections of the pedicab operators and police to do just that.

'The use of this particular law demonstrates that the police will take tough enforcement action where necessary with the full support of Westminster City Council.'

There was a call from MPs that they should be banned during the Olympics for the safety of the public.

These rickshaws, which are not regulated like other taxis, were a 'danger' and risked getting in the way of the emergency services during the Games.

Hayes and Harlington MP John McDonnell tabled a Commons motion listing a series of concerns, noting that rickshaw drivers do not have criminal record or police checks, are uninsured and can rip off passengers because there is no set fare structure.

It also expressed 'shock' that the vehicles do not have to pass crash tests.

'This House notes with concern the danger posed by pedicabs to the general public and visitors to London during the Olympic and Paralympic Games,' the motion read.

Rickshaws were branded a 'dangerous menace' during the mayoral election campaign, with candidates Boris

Johnson, Ken Livingstone and Brian Paddick all saying the Government should legislate to remove them from the West End.
