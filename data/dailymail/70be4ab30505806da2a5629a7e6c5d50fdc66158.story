rank Humphreys, 51, had sex with daughter Eleanor Jackson, 23 after she tracked him down on Facebook

A paedophile had sex with a daughter he had put up for adoption after she tracked him down on Facebook.

Eleanor Jackson, 23, was taken from her biological father Frank Humphreys, 51, when she was just 17 months old, a court heard.

But when she traced him as an adult the pair began a sexual relationship.

Humphreys and his daughter both pleaded guilty to incest

Humphreys, of Cleator Moor, Cumbria, was jailed at Carlisle Crown Court for 21 months.

The
 court heard that the pair had been estranged for a number of years 
since Jackson was put up for adoption when she was just 17-months-old.

However,
 Tim Brennand, prosecuting, said she had tracked Humphreys down through 
Facebook in 2010 and she - together with her twin sister - went to live 
with him.

He
 said that officials became suspicious when the pair were observed 
acting in a manner which was not just 'over familiar' but in an 'overtly
 sexualised manner'.

'Their relationship was overt and sexual and were involved with each other in a full physical relationship,' he added.

Mr Brennand said that others started to notice that the pair were not acting in a normal manner.

He said: 'Friends and family have also observed these two defendants interact with one another.

Judge Paul Batty QC said it was a 'terrible case' considering the age difference, her vulnerability and Humphrey's previous conviction for underage sex

'Once
 again there are small pieces of evidence suggestive of the fact that 
Humphreys was behaving in a sexualised manner towards his daughter.'

He said 
that both defendants had both strongly denied being in a sexual 
relationship and when first questioned Jackson had exercised her right 
to make 'no comment' to answers during interview.

However, the pair both changed their pleas to guilty at Carlisle Crown Court in February this year.

David Birrell, defending Humphreys, said there was 'very little mitigation' he could put before the court.

The court heard that Humphreys had a previous conviction for having sex with a 15-year-old girl when he was 28 years old.

Greg Hoare, defending Jackson, said she had been looking for some permanence when she decided to trace her biological father.

He added that the case had affected her and she had been shunned and even threatened by others as a result.

Judge Paul Batty QC said it was a 'terrible case' considering the age difference, her vulnerability and Humphrey's previous conviction for underage sex.

He said: 'You took them under your roof and there were serious concerns in relation to your activity.'

As well as the prison sentence, Humphreys will be made the subject of a sex offenders prevention order.

Under the terms of the order he will be prevented from having any contact with any child, or family member, under the age of 16 without permission.

Jackson was given a two-year community order, where she will be supervised by members of the probation service, as well as a five-month curfew between 9pm and 6am.

She will also be on the sex offenders register for five years.

Genetic sexual attraction is a seldom-talked about phenomenon that frequently occurs between adoptees and their long-lost parents.

It describes feelings of intense intimacy between two relatives who have been separated during the critical years of development and bonding, and then meet for the first time as adults.

Essentially strangers, when an adult-child and their biological parent finally meet, the brain struggles to associate each other as family.

Instead, they become captivated with one another, sharing similar physical features, likes and dislikes, which is coupled with complex feelings of intimacy. This can lead both parties to express their emotions sexually.

The phenomenon was first identified by Barbara Gonyo in the Eighties, after she a wrote book called I'm His Mother, But He's Not My Son, which recounted her personal story of reuniting with the son she placed for adoption at 16.

A sexual relationship with her son ensued, and Ms Gonyo says she fell in love - a byproduct of delayed bonding that normally takes place in infancy between new parents and their child, according to psychologists.

Researchers believe that when family members grow up in close proximity, a inherent taboo is created through reverse sexual imprinting, which desensitises them to later sexual attraction.

Called the Westermarck effect, researchers hypothesize it evolved so biological relatives would not inbreed.
