Plasterer Andy Barker thought it was the luckiest day of his life when he scooped £35,000 on Channel 4 quiz show Deal Or No Deal.

But it was a windfall that would land the 43-year-old in prison.

Amid the celebrations, Barker had forgotten one important point. He was declared bankrupt in November 2011, owing creditors £61,438, and was obliged by law to declare his winnings.

But instead of informing the Official 
Receiver, he put the cash in his NatWest account and then spent the lot 
within three months. The winnings went on plane tickets, jewellery and 
hotels.

Barker's triumph on the popular Noel Edmonds show was brought to an end after an eagle-eyed viewer notified the authorities.

The tip-off sparked an investigation by the Insolvency Service and prosecution by the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills.

At Warwick Crown Court, Barker, from Tamworth in Staffordshire, lost an appeal against the 13-week prison sentence imposed by magistrates for his failure to declare all the assets in his estate.

Barker went on a three-month spending spree following his jackpot win on Deal Or No Deal.

In that time he clocked up:

Tim Pole, barrister for the quiz show champ, told the court: 'What should have been a joyful moment has become a nightmare for him.

'For a man who has never been in trouble before and has worked hard all his life to suddenly make such a decision and find himself facing a custodial sentence, one can only imagine the impact it’s had on him.'

Barker had admitted the offence at Nuneaton Court in April and also pleaded guilty to removing the money from his account contrary to the Insolvency Act.

As well as jail, magistrates ordered him to pay £3,418 costs, but immediately granted him bail until the appeal was heard.

Unlike Deal Or No Deal, he did not emerge from the hearing a winner.

Divorced Barker had hoped to start a new career as a teacher, but that hope has been scuppered by the conviction.

Judge Richard Griffith-Jones told him: 'You were a man of good character until this and there is to be no stigma or sense that because you were a bankrupt it makes it worse.

'A lot of decent people end up being bankrupt.

'But this was a flagrant breach of your duty to the Official Receiver, and you spent the money quickly.'

After the case Glenn Wicks, Department of Business Innovation and Skills deputy chief investigations officer, said: 'Mr Barker thought he could get away with taking the money he had won and not informing the Official Receiver who could have used it to pay the creditors in his bankruptcy.

'He had, however, appeared publically on a television quiz show and was seen by people affected by his actions.

'This sentence should serve as a reminder that the rules of bankruptcy are there for a reason and must be followed. The courts take criminal offences like these very seriously.'
