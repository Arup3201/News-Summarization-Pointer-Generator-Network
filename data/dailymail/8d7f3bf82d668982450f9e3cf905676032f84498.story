Fearless: Shark conservationist Ocean Ramsey

Tail-riding through the ocean on the back of a great white shark Ocean Ramsey looks relaxed as she smiles confidently.

The stunning show of bravery is even more impressive considering she is swimming with one of the world's most feared ocean predators without protection.

But Ms Ramsey travels the globe swimming with many species of sharks hoping to prove they are nothing like their Jaws film reputation.

In these incredible photographs friend Juan Oliphant caught on camera the moment a massive 17-foot great white shark let Ms Ramsey 'tail ride' through the deep.

Ms Ramsey, a shark conservationist, who is 
also a scuba instructor, model and freediver, swam with the massive fish
 in waters off Baja Mexico last year.

The
 encounter with the biggest species of shark on earth meant the 
27-year-old has swum with 32 different species in total so far.

Ms Ramsey admits there will be fatalities sometimes when humans come into contact
 with sharks but often when the predators mistake them for prey.

Growing up in Hawaii and San Diego she was constantly in the water and she described first meeting and getting to touch the great white as similar to her experience of horses.

She
 said: 'I feel so fortunate that some of the greatest moments of my life
 have been diving with Great White sharks. I recently took my third swim
 with a group of Great Whites.

'It's difficult to express the incredible joy and breathtaking emotion experienced locking eyes with a Great White shark.

'Watching
 the shark acknowledge and observe me, while I peacefully and calmly 
allowed it to swim towards me, and then experiencing it accepting my 
touch, allowing me to dorsal and tail ride.

'Once
 I was on the dorsal or tail I could hear the movement of the water 
flying past my ears and I realized we were probably moving two knots.

'The connection felt as I repeatedly pet and hitched a ride on several of these sharks reminded me of my experience with horses.

Lucky: Ocean, who is based on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, said unusually they were lucky enough to come across groups of the elusive Great Whites in deep water used for tuna fishing

Contact: 'A lot can be said between two creatures that don't speak the same language. Even without eye contact'

Passionate: She said: 'Every story needs a villain, and after films like Jaws, its just to easy for most media to continue to manipulate the human psyche and ingrain a deeper more absurd terror'

Ms Ramsey,
 who is based on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, said unusually they were 
lucky enough to come across groups of the elusive Great Whites in deep 
water used for tuna fishing.

She said: 'The sharks are distinguishable by coloration over the gills and other body scars or markings.

'I
 believe I had seen one of these sharks on my first trip. The largest 
shark was a max estimated size of 17 foot and she was extremely wide in 
girth.

'I am not in a 
position to speculate if she may have been pregnant and the subject is 
interesting because so little is know about these animals

At one with nature: Miss Ramsey freediving with stingrays

Advice: Ms Ramsey does not advise everyone try and swim with sharks but her mission is to dispel myths about the amazing creatures under threat of extinction

'Currently, no one has observed them mating and the gestation period is also unknown. Even the life expectancy of a Great White is unknown.'

Ms Ramsey does not advise everyone try and swim with sharks but her mission is to dispel myths about the amazing creatures under threat of extinction.

She said: 'Every story needs a villain, and after films like Jaws, its just to easy for most media to continue to manipulate the human psyche and ingrain a deeper more absurd terror.

'Just showing these animals swimming around not biting or eating anything, as they are probably 99 percent of the time, isn't enough to convince people.

'I strongly urge people to quickly sign petitions that are being presented at CITES, that meeting will make a huge impact and comes up in March.
