Chloe Sevigny has posed with just a lobster covering her modesty.

Save her fashion jacket and mirror sandals, the 40-year-old can be seen on the cover of the Marfa Journal stark naked and sprawling out over a retro kitchen work top.

The actress, who is considered an influencer within many fashion circles, makes a series of bizarre statements from a nun in chain underwear to scantily-clad Red Riding Hood as she creates four fake movie posters for the magazine.

Claws for draws: Choe Sevigny ditches her underwear for new Marfa Journal pictures as she poses with a lobster over her crotch

The four fake billboards divide the whole magazine into four sections: raw, decadent, romantic and progressive.

And they're sure to get attention, though loyal fans' interest in the content may be waning as the shoot sees the Swedish actress in a whole new light.

Golden Globe winning and Academy Award nominated Chloe has previously enjoyed roles in Boys Don't Cry and American Psycho but these latest roles appear to put her in an all new-genre.

In the most shocking image of the four book quarters, the beauty ditches her underwear in favour of the large marine crustacean. 

Stark naked: Besides a long fashion coat and a belt, Chloe was stark naked in the snaps

Provocative: Chloe posed on her knees wearing knickers and a chain between her legs

The fashionista was not without her accessories nonetheless and layered on some tribal beads between her bare chest and accentuated her enviable waist with a studded belt.

She was seen sporting a subtle plaid coat, tying her tresses into a fuss-free low bun as she posed in a derelict kitchen setting.

While it is not believed that the lobster is real, PETA's Managing Director Ingrid E. Newkirk told MailOnline: 'We're too kind to say what a pity it is that the lobster wasn't alive and wearing knuckledusters.

'So all we'll say is that we hope one day Chloë will realise how inferior she seems compared to a little animal who was killed just to cover a t**t. 

Fashionista: The fashion darling was still styled to perfection in Jean Paul Gaultier and Chanel Cruise

Daring: The actress appeared to poke fun at the movie industry with a series of mock film posters

Chloe, going virginal in white for a second picture, shows off her youthful frame in a second poster while dressed in a nun costume and headscarf.

The title reads, 'Two Times A Virgin' and she sports lace knickers with a padlock and chain between her thighs to pose provocatively on her knees. 

Stylist Haley Wollens uses Chanel Cruise to dress the famous style star, as the cover caption indicates, with other credits including Proenza Schouler and Jean Paul Gaultier.

Chloe, photographed by Brianna Capozzi, enjoys a throwback moment in velvet for one snap and adds a sexy edge to a red cape for another Running With Wolves mock up. 

Baring her rock hard stomach, the actress sums it up perfectly as she scrawls 'I put the HOT in PSYCHOTIC' across her abs while puffing on a cigarette. 

Youthful: The star looked sensational with her trim shape on show in a vintage costume

Fashion fan: Stylist Haley Wollens used Chanel Cruise to dress the famous style star with other credits including Proenza Schouler and Jean Paul Gaultier.

Hot: The star summed it up perfectly with Hot In Psychotic written on her bare chest

Retro: The stylish star enjoyed a throwback moment in a velvet bra and trousers

Third issue: The Marfa Journal is a bi-annual European publication that combines of art and fashion

And the cheeky starlet certainly does look hot.

Youthful beyond her 40 years, the fashion darling shoots a full view of her bare behind, on which a temporary cherry tattoo can be seen in another daring image.

Chloe clashes her moods as she sports a sweet, white bonnet but pulls down her tights to reveal her derriere while leaning over a dirt bike.

Bi-annual European publication, Marfa Journal, combines of art and fashion and is now in its third issue, edited by Alexandra Gordienko. 

Movies appear to be the hot topic for Chloe at the moment, after she publicly named and shamed her favourite (and detested) female movie stars this week.

The blonde hit out at Academy Award winner Jennifer Lawrence in the spring issue of V magazine. 

She said: ‘I love when a movie star is a great movie star. I think Angelina is a great movie star. 

‘I like Emma Stone. Whenever she’s herself, she’s really cute. Jennifer Lawrence I find annoying. Too crass.’ 

Cheeky: The model and actress bent over a dirt bike in her crystal whites, including a bonnet

Wild one: She didn't managed a smile but instead a moody stare while showing off her bare bottom

'So much is about marketing and selling the product,' the star continued. And her latest photo shoot appears to be yet further poking fun at the movie industry.

Moving away from Hollywood, Chloe's latest career move is her sixth collection in collaboration with Opening Ceremony.

The Spring/Summer 2015 womenswear line is themed around preppy chic, inspired by the satirical ’80s cult film Heathers.

Sassy: Chloe was modelling in a leotard and pointed boots with Hello Kitty designs 

Retro: She enjoyed seventies styling in a patterned jumpsuit and long mermaidian locks

Magazine star: Four fake movie posters divide the whole magazine into four sections: Raw, Decadent, Romantic and Progressive
