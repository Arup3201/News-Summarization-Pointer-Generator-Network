A grandfather has shot dead a lawyer and seriously wounded the father of his three-year-old grandchild during a custody battle in a Danish courtroom.

The 67-year-old gunman, who has not been named, opened fire in the court in Copenhagen before being arrested nearby.

A Danish tabloid newspaper posted a photo on its website showing a police officer aiming a weapon at a person on his knees, saying it showed the suspect being arrested

After the shooting, police sealed off the Town Hall Square in Raadhuspladsen in Copenhagen, where the court is situated 

The gunman opened fire in the courtroom killing a 57-year-old lawyer and seriously wounding another man, the father of the gunman's three-year-old grandchild

Police and court officials confirmed that the victims were a 57-year-old lawyer and his client, a 31-year-old man who was in a custody dispute with the gunman's daughter.

It is thought the shooting happened in the bailiff's court, which is part of the city court and when the gunman was apprehended, police seized a rifle used in the shooting.

According to Ekstra Bladet, the 67-year-old entered the courtroom at 10 am this morning, with a sawn-off rifle, which he had hidden in a bag.

Shortly after he fired a total of six shots, some in the courtroom and others in the hallway outside.

Initial reports suggested one of the vicitms was shot inide the building and another outside, but officials later said they were both shot inside the court.

The child's father is said to have staggered outside the court building where he collapsed and was then taken to hospital with serious wounds

Security is normally relaxed in Danish courts except for court sessions related to terrorism, criminal gangs and high-security cases

The child's father is said to have staggered outside the court building where he collapsed and was then taken to hospital with serious wounds but his condition is not thought to be life-threatening.

The lawyer was pronounced dead at the scene.

Soren Axelsen, head of Copenhagen City Court said: ' It is a family tragedy, not an attack on the court or the legal system.'

He also added that he believed it was the first ever shooting at the Copenhagen City Court, which was established in 1771.

Security is normally relaxed in Danish courts except for court sessions related to terrorism, criminal gangs and high-security cases where everyone but lawyers and judges must walk through metal detectors.
