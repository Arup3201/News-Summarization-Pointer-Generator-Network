Police investigating the shooting 
death of a 10-year-old Georgia girl discovered her father is a convicted
 felon and have arrested him for illegal gun possession.

Taylor
 Jowers, of Waycross, was reportedly shot dead at home by her brother 
just after 1.00 p.m. Friday afternoon using a shotgun owned by father 
Joshua Jowers - he is a convicted felon barred by law from owning any 
firearms.

Joshua Jowers, 33, was convicted in 2011 of felony methylphenidate possession, Ware County Sheriff Randy Royal told MailOnline.

 into her chest, police said

Joshua
 Jowers' arrest came after police were called to his home following the 
Friday afternoon shooting.

Jowers' 15-year-old son asked sister Taylor to hold a 12-gauge shotgun while he made sure it wasn’t loaded, 
the Florida Times-Union reported.

The gun accidentally discharged and fatally shot her in the chest, police said.

An
 investigation into the tragedy discovered Joshua Jowers was a convicted
 felon, and also uncovered multiple firearms inside the residence, Royal
 explained.

'Detectives
 secured a felony criminal arrest warrant against Jowers for the charge 
of possession of a firearm(s) by convicted felon,' said Royal.

'In addition to the shotgun in the residence, several other firearms were also found and seized by detectives,' he added.

Scene of the tragedy: Jowers was shot dead in this Waycross home, police said

A neighbor who spoke to WJXT told of the moments after the accidental shooting when the brother ran to her house for help.

‘He just said that his sister was shot,’ the neighbor told WJXT.
 ‘I called the ambulance and all the responders and everything got out 
here as fast as they could and tried to help her as much as they could.’

She was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.

Jowers' parents were both working and not home at the time she was shot, cops said.

Authorities
 have declined to confirm or deny her brother was the suspected shooter,
 saying only that it is 'an older relative' who is a minor.

When
 asked whether an involuntary manslaughter or similar charge is being 
considered against the relative is being considered, the spokesperson 
said only that the incident is still under investigation.
