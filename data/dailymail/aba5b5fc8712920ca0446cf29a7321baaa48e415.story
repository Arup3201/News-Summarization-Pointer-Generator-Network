A four-year-old girl has died following an E. coli infection and her five-year-old friend has suffered kidney failure after they shared a turkey sandwich.

Serena Faith Profitt passed away in Doernbecher Children's Hospital in Portland, Oregon on Monday and doctors have since confirmed that she tested positive for E. coli.

Brad Sutton, who remains hospitalized at Mary Bridge Children's Hospital in Tacoma, Washington, suffered kidney failure, which is also associated with E. coli, Q13Fox reported.

Their devastated families said they believe they fell ill after sharing a turkey sandwich at Roadhouse 18 Bar and Grill in Otis - because it was the only thing the children ate and no one else tasted it.

The restaurant's owner told KGW that county health inspectors are investigating the restaurant. Oregon Public Health Division are also investigating the cause. 

The children shared the snack at the start of Labor Day weekend and two days later, both started complaining of abdominal pains and fevers, The Oregonian reported. They then started passing bloody diarrhea.

On Wednesday, Serena's parents took her to the ER, but doctors found nothing alarming so sent her home and told her parents to keep her hydrated - but she got worse.

On Saturday, her parents took her to hospital and physicians sent her to Doernbecher Children's Hospital, where she was immediately put on dialysis.

Questions: Brad's mother Elizabeth, pictured with him in hospital, believes the food was to blame

Just as she showed signs of improving, she suffered a stroke on Sunday, her uncle told The Oregonian. An MRI scan revealed she had suffered brain damage. 

'It attacked her nervous system,' the uncle, Travis Hargitt, said. 'Then it moved to her brain.'

Doctors declared her brain dead on Monday morning, and she passed away at 9pm.

Serena's parents also lost their first child at birth. They have one other child, a two-year-old daughter.

Their relatives, who described Serena as a book lover and a great singer, have set up a GoFundMe page to help them pay the hospital bills.

'She's the most vibrant young girl ever; she’s just sweet, loving and so amazing, so smart, just a heart that is of gold,' her aunt, Aleahsa Hargitt, told KPTV.

Brad Sutton is stable but doctors have said there is a risk of a stroke or seizures.

Now the families are hoping to find what inflicted such terror on their children's bodies. 

'I know in my heart it's what they ate because everyone else is just fine,' Brad's mother Elizabeth Sutton told The Oregonian.

E. coli normally lives in the intestines of healthy people and animals and most varieties are harmless or cause brief diarrhea. But a few particularly nasty strains, including E. coli O157:H7, can cause severe abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea and vomiting, according to the Mayo Clinic.

Foods at high risk of carrying E. coli include under-cooked meat - especially beef - spinach, lettuce, sprouts, raw milk and unpasteurized cider. It can also be passed on contact and some major cases have occurred among children who visited petting zoos.

In other incidents, it has been passed in rural waters tainted by human or animal feces. If the water has no disinfecting system and children swim in it, they can become infected.

A few days after exposure to the bacteria, the patient may suffer from diarrhea - which is sometimes bloody - abdominal cramping and vomiting.

Healthy adults usually recover within a week after being infected by E. coli O157:H7, but children and older adults can develop a kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome.

There is no treatment to cure the symptoms and doctors mostly recommend rest and for the patient to fight against dehydration and fatigue. A serious E. coli infection that leads to hospitalization may require IV fluids, blood transfusions and dialysis. 

Complications from E. coli O157:H7 have killed 20 people in Oregon - where Serena passed away - since 1992, The Oregonian reported. The last child killed by the strain was in 2010.
