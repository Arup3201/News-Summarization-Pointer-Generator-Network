Did Los Angeles Clipper Blake Griffin take out his anger at being ejected from his team's first playoff game on an unlucky fan?

Griffin was clearly upset when he fouled out against the Golden State Warriors. And when he saw a replay of his last foul he threw his hands up in frustration.

But at the time he just happened to be holding a cup of water in one hand that he emptied out onto the Warriors fan standing behind him.

The Warriors went on to take the game 109-105.

Most likely it was an innocent accident. But Sports Illustrated notes that both the victim and his friend are dressed in Warrios shirts and had cheered at Griffin's ejection.

Would cheering a foul be enough to get Griffin to throw water on a fan?

The fan in question, 22-year-old Will Meldman, doesn't think so.

'Honestly, I think it fell out of his hand,' he said in an interview with Yahoo Sports.

Griffin walks off without even noticing what he's done

'He fouled out and he was frustrated, so it just fell out of his hand,' he said. 'It just slipped out.'

For what it's worth, Meldman's unnamed friend sitting next to him at the time believes it was a purposeful dousing.

For now, only Blake Griffin knows for sure.
