A convicted murderer who kicked to death a paedophile in his cell had been encouraged to describe his violent fantasies during therapy sessions, it has emerged.

Lee Foye, then 27, was serving a life sentence in Grendon Prison, Buckinghamshire, which houses a 'unique therapeutic community', when he repeatedly stamped on the head of child sex offender Robert Coello, then left him for dead.

Today it has emerged Foye's attack came after months of lengthy discussions about his disturbing desires to attack strangers.

Lee Foye (left) was 27 when he stamped on child sex offender Robert Coello (right) so hard he died in HMP Grendon, which provides unique therapy sessions. There, Foye was permitted to describe his dark fantasies

In one open session, he even told a group that Coello should be 'put down' for his crimes.

Speaking at an inquest in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, today, Patrick Madikate, head of psychotherapy at Grendon's G Wing, said: 'He talked about having violent fantasies about people he didn’t know. 
There were people throwing stones at his mother’s house and hurling 
insults.

'He felt at the time that he had violent fantasies of harming these people.'

The
 inquest also heard that Mr Mandikate had been told that Foye had 
muttered 'he should be put down' about Coello, during a another group 
session two days before he attacked him.

However, Mr Mandikate said Foye’s fantasies were noted but not viewed as a serious problem as it was encouraged behaviour.

'In
 therapy, if someone begins to talk about fantasies it is seen as a good
 thing, as they are alerting us to thought processes,' he said.

'As long as they then sign up to not acting on those thoughts.'

Grendon Prison (pictured) was opened as an experiment in 1962 to offer psychiatric therapy to inmates

Coello was jailed in 2006 after admitting four counts of rape, 11 counts of indecent assault and one count of penetrative sex, using a snooker cue, on the teenage female victim.

Foye was serving a life sentence for the brutal murder of Lauren Strachan, 19, in August 2005, who he had apparently gone to for sex and then stabbed her 47 times when she threatened to tell his girlfriend.

He was sentenced to a further life sentence with a minimum tariff of 31 years after the brutal killing in August 2010.

Officials told the court there had been concerns about placing Coello in the prison with other inmates.

'I guessed who the victim was straightaway but I couldn’t guess the perpetrator,' said Geraldine Ackerman, a forensic psychiatrist on G wing.

She
 described Coello as unique in his presentation on the wing and said he 
upset other members of his group in therapy by talking about his vile 
offences before the group had become familiar with one another and 
comfortable discussing their crimes.

'We
 suggest people get to know them first before they talk about their 
offences as prisoners, and people on the outside, find it very difficult
 to listen to details of sexual offending against a child,' said Mrs 
Akerman.

'We likened it [Coello discussing his offences before people were ready] to his 
offending, as he was forcing something that wasn’t ready to happen.'

However,
 she said that there had been no feud or animosity between Coello and 
Foye prior to the murder and the pair had little to do with one another.

Inquest: Officials told Beaconsfield Coroner's Court there were concerns over placing Coello in Grendon

An inmate, named only as SB, said the incident took place as Foye went round cells demanding his CDs and games be returned.

Someone told SB: ‘He’s in there doing him in’.

'I didn’t know what he meant,' SB said, 'but then I heard banging from across the hall.'

SB looked into Coello’s cell through the flap and saw Foye standing over Coello’s body.

Therapist Judith Coucill recalled the session where Foye muttered 
'people like that should be put down'.

'The
 group were talking about issues over Robert Coello in that he had been 
giving details of his offences to one member of the community,' she 
said.

'This member was very angry and disturbed by this.'

The
 inquest heard that at one point the man who had taken issue with him 
got up and left. He returned and Coello later got up and left, followed 
by the other man.

'I believe it was at this point that I heard Lee Foye say "people like that should be put down",' said Ms Coucill.

Coello and the man then returned and the meeting concluded, with no issues reported at a later staff meeting.

Grendon Prison opened in 1962 as an experimental treatment prison for psychiatric disorders and is now a unique therapy centre in the UK prison system.

Housing 238 prisoners separated into wards of 40, the prison provides daily therapy sessions in groups of eight as well as larger feedback sessions in their wing.At least 90 per cent of the prison’s population are on indeterminate sentences for serious sexual offences, murder and violent crimes.Inmates must apply and be accepted to move to Grendon, at which point they undertake up to 16 weeks of probation on a 'new inmates' wing. This is followed by another three months on regular wings.

Throughout, their engagement with therapy sessions is assessed by staff.The prisoner's operational manager Chirstopher Dowthwaite said Coello’s murder was the first violent death in the prison’s history and that violent attacks were very rare as prisoners knew that violence would mean they were forced to leave.He added: 'By the end of their sentence, prisoners should understand their offending behaviour, confront it and obtain help for it.'

Ms Coucill said this sort of comment happened regularly in therapy and similar issues were an everyday occurrence.

Patrick
 Mandikate, the prison’s head of psychotherapy, admitted he was 'uneasy'
 with the decision to place Coello on G Wing last year.

He said: 'It was made clear to me in no uncertain terms that we needed to fill these beds no matter who was available.'

He
 added that he did not believe Foye had said Coello, from Reading, 
Berkshire, should be put down as he was involved in the meeting when it 
was supposedly said and never heard the comment.

After
 his arrest, Thames Valley Police asked Mr Mandikate about Foye 
reportedly saying: 'I’m going to take someone, lock them in my cell and 
kill them', but he said this had not happened either.

Mr Mandikate said Foye had obsessed about building muscles and revealed he had used steroids to bulk up in the past, but also said he had shown signs of good progress and commitment to the treatment programme.

The inquest heard that Foye and Coello were never in the same small therapy group but both lived on G wing, so would be together in larger feedback sessions.

Richard Hulett, senior coroner for Buckinghamshire, heard evidence from Home Office pathologist Dr Robert Chapman, who confirmed the cause of death as severe head injuries, as well as the prison’s operational manager Christopher Dowthwaite.

Mr Dowthwaite added that a report of concerns had been opened involving Coello before his attack, meaning he attended meetings with therapists and staff to monitor the issue.

The situation was deemed resolved 10 days before the attack, and at a follow-up meeting with Mr Dowthwaite held four days before Coello’s death.

'He made no mention of Lee Foye when he had his post-closure review,' he said.

The inquest is expected to last until next week.
