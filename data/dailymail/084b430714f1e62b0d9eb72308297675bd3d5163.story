Animal rights activists are poised to sabotage the controversial cull of thousands of badgers which is set to begin tonight.

More than 5,000 badgers will be shot in west Gloucestershire and west Somerset over a six-week period in an attempt stop the spread of TB among cattle.

Badgers are blamed for spreading the disease to livestock, devastating herds and costing dairy farmers and the taxpayer millions of pounds a year.

Ministers say that unless everything possible is done to control the disease, the bill to the country will top £1billion over the next decade.

But critics favour other methods, including vaccination, and say that the science behind the cull is not sound.

They warn that many animals will die a slow, painful death, after being maimed, rather than killed outright and say that studies have shown that killing badgers can actually foster the spread of the disease, rather than control it.

Rock star Brian May has helped raise the opposition’s profile and will today lead a march against the ‘pointless slaughter’.

More extreme groups have pledged to sabotage the cull by using techniques from making noise to scare the badgers away to putting marksmen under citizen’s arrest.

Under the terms of the licenses for the culls, at least 70 per cent of the badgers must be killed during a six-week period between now and the start of February.

The culling period is concentrated in this way to try to prevent the disease being spread by infected creatures fleeing into surrounding areas.

The animals will be shot in fields by trained marksmen or killed after being caught in baited traps.

No advance warning will be given of the start of the cull.  Some speculate it won’t start until crops are harvested and the tourist season is over.  The alternative view is that an early start would stop tension from building further and deprive activists of preparation time.

Long-term, the strategy could cut the amount of TB in the area by 16 per cent.

The two pilot schemes are designed to show that the widespread shooting of badgers is safe and humane, as well as feasible.

If successful, it could be extended to other bovine TB hotpots.

A cattle vaccine is a decade away and while a jab for badgers exists, its administration is hugely time-intensive as each animal has to be caught and immunised individually.

Farming minister David Heath told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘All the countries that have successfully dealt with this disease have employed a policy similar to ours.

‘What we’re trying to see in these pilot culls is whether it can be done humanely, safely and efficiently.

‘If we have a comprehensive strategy we might be able to deal with this devastating disease.’

The National Farmers’ Unions says that with the number of cases of bovine TB exploding in recent years, a cull is the only option.

Shadow environment minister Mary Creagh described the cull as ‘an untested and risky approach’.

She added: ‘The policing costs, paid by the taxpayer, will balloon to £4million while bovine TB will increase over the next two years as the shooting displaces badgers.’

Philip Mansbridge, chief executive of the charity Care for the Wild, said: ‘The Government and the NFU are blindly embarking on one of the worst agricultural policies of the last 30 years, which will lead to senseless slaughter, chaos and disruption in the countryside, huge cost to the taxpayer and no meaningful reduction in the spread of bovine TB.’

The Hunt Saboteurs Organisation said it has already surveyed the cull site and has people in the area. More will be brought in as needed.

Spokesman Lee Moon said the group will use bright lights and whistles to scare the badgers away but, if necessary, members will ‘stand in front of the guns’.

The cull will be discussed in Parliament on Wednesday at a debate called by Labour.
