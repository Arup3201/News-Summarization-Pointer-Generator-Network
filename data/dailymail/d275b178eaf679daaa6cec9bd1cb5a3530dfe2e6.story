Firefighters are warning snack lovers not to warm their Eccles cakes in the microwave after a string of fires caused by the sugar bursting into flames.

Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said at least three blazes have been caused in the last three weeks after people put the pastries into their microwaves to warm them up.

Statistics show the service has been called to 16 fires started by food being overcooked in a microwave over the past two years.

A Chorley Fire Station spokesman said: 'Whether a grill, a hob, a conventional oven or a microwave are used to heat food, it's essential not to leave it unattended.

'Manufacturers' instructions for cooking or warming-up food should be followed and although for many foods the option of conventional or microwave oven cooking heating is often offered, where a microwave is not specified as an option it's best not to use one.'

The instructions on shop-bought Eccles cakes advise that if they are to be eaten hot, a conventional oven should always be used to warm them through beforehand.

The small round pastries have caused three fires in recent weeks after attempts to warm them in microwaves went wrong as the heat caused the sugar on top to burn

The popular pastries are named after the
 English town of Eccles in Salford, Greater Manchester. It is not known 
who invented the recipe, but James Birch is credited with being the 
first person to sell Eccles cakes on a commercial basis from his shop in
 the town centre in 1793.

Jon Wills of Satterthwaites bakery on Coronation Road, Crosby, said that Eccles cakes were one of the store’s biggest sellers.

He told the Crosby Herald: 'It’s never a good idea to 
heat pastries in a microwave because they cook from the inside out and 
go soggy and with the Eccles cakes the currants would overheat.'

Eccles Cakes are made using currants, sandwiched between two layers of shortcrust pastry, and topped with a caramelised sugar coating.

Householders were warned never to try to
 heat Eccles cakes using a microwave, amid fears they could cause a more
 serious accident.

Crosby station Watch manager James Murphy said: 'The sugar in Eccles cakes can ignite if cooked for too long.

'They are caramilised and as such are flammable, especially in a microwave.

'We have had to respond to several blazes started by Eccles cakes and the microwaves have also been ruined by the fires.

'We advise that cooking of any item is never left unattended, even for a moment.'
