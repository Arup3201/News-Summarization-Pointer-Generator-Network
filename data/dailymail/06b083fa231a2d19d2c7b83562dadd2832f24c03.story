Sarah Silverman's father has attacked an Orthodox rabbi who criticised his daughter's life choices.

Ronald Silverman, 75, called rabbi Yaakov Rosenblatt an 'a**hole,' and warned, 'don't f**k with my family'.

His angered response comes after Rabbi Rosenblatt published on open letter on JewishPress.com, which takes issue with the 42-year-old's use of 'biblical language' in her Let My People Vote campaign, and assaults her choice to focus on her career rather than have a family.

Rabbi Rosenblatt, who has since been labelled a misogynist by commenters, wrote: 'You will soon turn 42 and your destiny, as you stated, will not 
include children. You blame it on your depression, saying you don’t want
to pass it on to another generation.

'Surely you appreciate being alive and 
surely, if the wonder of your womb were afflicted with your weaknesses 
and blessed with your strengths, it would be happy to be alive, too.

He continued: 'I think, Sarah, that marriage and childrearing are not in the cards for you because you can’t focus on building life when you spend your days and nights tearing it down.

'Take your false god, and shove god up your judgmental a**'

'That is why you have had trouble forging a permanent relationship – the most basic desire of the feminine soul.'

He adds: 'Nothing
you say or stand for, Sarah, from your sickening sexual proposal to a 
Republican donor to your equally vulgar tweet to Mitt Romney, has the 
slightest thing to do with the most basic of tenets which Judaism has 
taught the world – that the monogamous relationship is the most 
meaningful one and that a happy marriage is the key to wholesomeness.'

The 'sickening sexual proposal' rabbi 
Rosenblatt refers to is Ms Silverman's Let My People Vote 
campaign, in which she uses 'biblical language' to make a counter 
proposal to Mitt Romney's campaign backer Sheldon Adelson.

Mr
Adelson pledged to give the GOP presidential candidate as much as $100 
million for his fight, and Ms Silverman asked him to give it to 
Barack Obama, instead.

Mr Silverman took to the comments section of the rabbi's online letter, writing about
the comedienne's older sister Susan, who is a rabbi living in 
Jerusalem, and whose husband, Jewish leader Yosef Abramowitz, has 
received three co-nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize.

'Hey a**hole. Daughter #1 is a rabbi,' Mr Silverman writes.

'Not by your standards. She's reform. How dare she, a lowly woman think god wants her to be a rabbi, created from a mere rib.

'Her
hubby, three times nominated for a nobel peace prize was listed by the 
Jerusalem Post as the 49th most influential jew in the world built the 
worlds largest solar field in Israel. 

'By the way, Sarah was also on the 
list. I missed your name. Oldest granddaughter is serving in the Israel 
Defense Forces. I'm sure you also served.Oh I forgot the orthodox don't 
do that. You don't f*ck with my family.'

He also added: 'Is your wife allowed to go to a minion or sit at the front if a bus or choose between abortion or birth. Take your false god and shove god up your judgmental a**'.

An appreciative Ms Silverman tweeted in response: 'Oh, Dad! You're my hero. Where do you get such moxie??'

Interestingly, a writer for The Jewish Press posted an update on the news website's blog section, fundamentally disagreeing with the rabbi.

'Why single out Sarah? Pick 
on Simon and Garfunkel instead'

Tzvi Fishman wrote: 'What is a rabbi doing in a place he doesn’t belong?

'Furthermore, is he now going to set out on a campaign to rebuke every
Jewish comedian in Hollywood, and every Jewish actor, director, 
playwright, musician, politician, Facebook inventor, and Jewish 
Federation president who married a gentile? Why single out Sarah? Pick 
on Simon and Garfunkel instead.'

Commenters on the site have also retaliated.

Hannah Riederer, from Minnesota, wrote: 'I found this article rather insulting as a Jew and a women.Sarah Silverman is standing up for justice. This article is just judgmental.'

Jason Feifer, from Florida, added: 'Thank you, Rabbi Yaakov Rosenblatt, for continuing to prove that 
religious intolerance such as yours is completely disgusting, no matter 
what religion it comes from.'

And one Californian resident commented: 'As a 44 year old Jewess who is married and childless by choice, I would like to offer this thought -- Anything you may have said in your "open letter" that was of value is completely drowned out by your misogynist leanings and tunnel vision.'
