Rwanda is requiring all visitors from the U.S. and Spain to self-monitor, fill out an extensive questionnaire and report their medical condition for the first 21 days over Ebola fears. 

The order by the Rwanda government was posted on the website of the U.S. Embassy in Rwanda yesterday.

It said the Rwandan Ministry of Health had introduced new Ebola Virus Disease screening requirements which required anyone who had been in the two countries during the last 22 days to report their medical condition by phone - regardless of whether they are experiencing symptoms - for the duration of their visit, or for the first 21 days.

Rwanda is requiring all visitors from the U.S. and Spain to self-monitor, fill out an extensive questionnaire and report their medical condition for the first three weeks over Ebola fears; both countries have reported deaths from the virus

Rwanda has so far being unaffected by Ebola; it is 2,600 miles east of Liberia - where a burial team is seen above moving the body of a woman suspected to have died from the virus

And that Rwanda continue to deny entry to visitors who travelled to Guinea, Liberia, Senegal, or Sierra Leone within the past 22 days.

Rwanda is located about 2,600 miles east of Liberia, the closest of the three West African countries affected by the outbreak, and has so far reported no cases of the virus. 

The World Health Organisation says more than 4,500 people have died from the current Ebola outbreak, the vast majority of them in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

Both the U.S. and Spain have recorded deaths from Ebola. In Dallas, a Liberian national died of the virus two weeks ago and two nurses who treated him tested positive for the virus. At least two Spanish missionaries died in Spain after contracting the disease in West Africa. One Spanish nurse also tested positive for the virus.

The new screening system in Rwanda follows a controversy in New Jersey over the enrolment of two Rwandan children that prompted their parents to keep them at home for 21 days, USA Today reported.

 A nurse at Howard Yocum Elementary School in Maple Shade sent a note to staff members saying that the school intended to take the temperature of the students three times a day for the next three weeks, the normal incubation period for Ebola.

Parents of pupils at the school then became aware of the note which later prompted the two Rwandan students' parents to voluntarily keep them at home  

Yesterday the school district apologised over the incident and on its website, saying it had 'become the unwitting face of our nations fears with regard to pressing health concerns'.

The school said the Rwandan students would start classes next week.

In Sierra Leone, up to 20 people are dying and dozens of new cases are being reported every day as the Ebola outbreak there moves west from rural areas toward the capital, Freetown officials said.

So many people are succumbing to the deadly virus that removing the dead bodies is becoming a serious problem.

Lawmaker Claude Kamanda told the local Politico newspaper that authorities are experiencing challenges collecting corpses from both quarantined and non-quarantined homes.

Dozens of people are falling sick each day in western Sierra Leone and the death toll is mounting so quickly authorities are struggling to remove all of the bodies

Authorities say the uncontrolled movement of people from the interior to Waterloo - which is the gateway to Freetown - has fueled the increase of Ebola cases in the west.

There are 851 total confirmed Ebola cases in the Western Area Urban and Western Area Rural zones, NERC reported.

In terms of numbers of cases, the two western zones may soon surpass a former epicenter of the outbreak in Sierra Leone - the eastern districts of Kenema and Kailahun where there have been a total of 1,012 confirmed cases.
