This is the extraordinary moment a vehicle sank all the way into the beach after the driver got stuck.

The 22-year-old driver from Bristol got into difficulty on Berrow Beach in Somerset after attempting to drive through deep mud in his Toyota Celica on Saturday evening.

His wheels quickly sank into the infamous mudflats and as the tide drew closer he tried and failed to push it free.

Search and Rescue from nearby Burnham on Sea was called to the scene on Sunday morning but it was not possible to recover the car safely.

Sedgemoor District Council, which manages Berrow Beach, says it was now in discussions with the car owner to arrange for it to be removed.

The council's Resorts Manager Graham Newing said: 'We have spoken with the gentleman involved, who is arranging for recovery.'

The six-mile long beach - the second longest stretch of sand in Europe - is infamous for its wide exposure of soft sand and mud at low tide and is patrolled between May 1 and September 30.

Mudflats or tidal flats as they are sometimes known, are coastal wetlands that form when the tide comes in and mud and silt are deposited.

The water mixes with the mud and silt, creating the muddy quicksand, which can be dangerous and treacherous.

Councillor Tony Grimes, whose ward covers the beach, said he usually sees around two or three similar incidents every year.

He told MailOnline: 'Quite frankly I find it amazing that people still try and do it - there are plenty of warning signs telling people to stay off.

'People just get a bit blasé and think it will be okay and it might be one minute but the next thing the tide comes in and they're stuck.'

He added that the parish council has 'done everything it can' to prevent people from wandering too far and says it is a case of 'education'.

'There are wardens with loud speakers and plenty of warning signs so there really is no need for it.

'If people stick to the main part and don't go out too far then there wouldn't be any problems. But they get carried away.'

The incident, which is one of several that have occurred this year along the stretch of coastline which has one of the world's highest tidal ranges raises fresh questions about the safety of vehicles on the beaches. 

However, Cllr Grimes noted that there are designated areas of the beach for cars and to ban all vehicles would be 'unrealistic'.

In 2002 a five-year-old girl died on Berrow Beach when she became trapped in the mudflats while on a walk with her mother's boyfriend during a family holiday from Worcester.

The RAF found the little girl face-down in the water and she later died in hospital.
