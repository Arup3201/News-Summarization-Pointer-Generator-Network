Nacer Bouhanni claimed his second victory of the week by a wheel as he sprinted to a stage eight win in Albacete at the Vuelta a Espana on Saturday.

FDJ.fr sprinter Bouhanni was pushed all the way by Giant-Shimano's John Degenkolb, who already has two stage wins this Vuelta, and Orica-GreenEdge's Michael Matthews.

Movistar's Alejandro Valverde retained the leader's red jersey, however, with team-mate Nairo Quintana 15 seconds back, then Tinkoff-Saxo's Alberto Contador and Team Sky's Chris Froome remaining in the top four.

'I had good legs today,' Bouhanni said on www.velonews.competitor.com after crossing the line first on the 207km route from Baeza to Albacete.

'I was a bit surprised I could win. I went early, because I did not want to get boxed in.

'It was a hard stage, very nervous when the bunch started to split up. My team did a great job to help me stay in good position.'

A six-minute breakaway had been established early on by Lampre-Merida's Elia Favilli and Caja Rural-Seguros RGA's Javier Aramendia but they were caught with less than 40km remaining. 

Valverde, Froome and Contador remained in the front group as the peloton split in two before 50 men contested a bunch sprint on the final straight.

Frenchman Bouhanni showed his form however to break clear with 300 metres to go, leading Matthews and Cannondale's Peter Sagan to the line.
