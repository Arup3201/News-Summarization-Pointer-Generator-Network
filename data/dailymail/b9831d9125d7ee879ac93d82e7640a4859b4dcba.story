An Ohio public high school is at the center of a controversy over a Ten Commandments plaque hanging in the school hall.

The plaque was given to Harding High School by the class of 1953 and has been displayed next to a preamble of the United States Constitution. 

The school principal ordered it be removed in August.

Fox News reports that Marion City Schools have said its had avoided other challenges to Ten Commandments displays.

In response, freshman Anthony Miller has gone on strike and is refusing to do classwork or homework. 

'I don't care about my grades right now,' he told The Marion Star.

'I told the principal, until there is an agreement reached, I will not participate in any Harding-related activities, any Marion City Schools-related activities. Sports, choir, classes, whatever. I won't even wear my Harding Marching Band shirt.'

Superintendent Gary Barber defended the decision and that it was not 'made arbitrarily.'

'Our responsibility, when we're challenged, is we do what's in line with the law,' he told reporters. 

A compromise may be worked out, school officials said.
