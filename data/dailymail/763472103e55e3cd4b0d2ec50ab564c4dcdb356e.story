Record numbers of accidents are being caused by drivers illegally speaking or texting on hand-held mobile phones.

Crashes in which mobiles have been a contributory factor have soared by 21 per cent in just three years.

In the year to 2013 alone, fatalities in which mobiles played a part rose by five – from 17 to 22, an increase of nearly a third (29.4 per cent).

Accidents involving mobiles rose from 378 in 2012 to a high of 422 last year – up 11.6 per cent.

The rise bucks the trend of a drop in the overall accident rate, prompting demands from the RAC for a crackdown on texting or making hand-held calls at the wheel. 

RAC chief engineer David Bizley said the trend of rising numbers of accidents involving mobile phones being used at the wheel will only be reversed when it becomes ‘as unacceptable as drink-driving’.

He said: ‘We are ... calling on the police to enforce the current laws on the use of hand-held phones while driving more effectively.

‘This must be supported by a high-profile, government-funded road safety campaign that makes using a hand-held mobile phone at the wheel as socially unacceptable as drink driving.

Mr Bizley said: ‘A report by the Transport Research Laboratory in June this year demonstrated that talking on a hand-held phone while driving causes a 46 per cent reduction in reaction speeds, compared to 13 per cent for drivers drinking to the legal limit. This is extremely compelling and puts into perspective the dangers of using a phone while driving.’

He added: ‘We feel there is currently a high level of acceptability which is something both this government, and the next administration that takes over in May 2015, needs to address as a matter of urgency if we are to prevent the number of accidents continuing to rise.’

Motorists caught using a mobile behind the wheel can be punished with three penalty points and a £100 fine

The figures come from the Department for Transport’s analysis of contributing factors to accidents. The number where a mobile was used by the driver rose from 349 in 2010 to 422 in 2013 – up 21 per cent. 

The RAC Report on Motoring 2014 found that more than a third (34 per cent) of drivers say they worry about other motorists being distracted by their hand-held mobile phones while behind the wheel.

Their report also found three quarters  of motorists report regularly observing other people chatting on their hand-held mobile phones while driving.

However, just eight per cent of motorists admit to doing it themselves, says the RAC report: ‘This suggests that the underlying issue is the social acceptability of using a mobile phone at the wheel’.  

Using a hand-held mobile at the wheel has been illegal for a decade and is punishable with three penalty points and a £100 fine.

Ministers say they are considering increasing penalties further.
