Coasting schools in middle-class areas will be targeted by government hit squads if they fail to improve, David Cameron warned last night.

The Prime Minister said former head teachers could be sent in to turn round schools in affluent areas which inspectors believe should be doing far better.

He made his pledge ahead of an announcement today of a rescue package for 500 of England’s worst schools.

David Cameron, on a visit to Ark Charter Academy in Portsmouth today, vowed to target schools in middle-class areas for whom there is no excuse for poor performance, as well as institutions tackling poverty

Local experts, including ex-heads, will be sent in to get rid of poor teachers, beef up curriculums and implement tough disciplinary regimes.

Mr Cameron will also announce a central pool of the best teachers, who would be sent into failing schools. He wants 1,500 such ‘crack teachers’ in a National Teacher Service by 2020.

In an article for the Daily Mail the Prime Minister warns that the powers would not only be used for failing schools contending with poverty, violence and lack of aspiration in the poorest communities, but also in middle-class areas where schools have no excuses for poor performance.

He said: ‘We will look at what they can do for … what I call coasting schools … Every day a school fails is a day too long. So these measures will happen fast.’

The intervention follows a damning Ofsted report warning of a culture of low-level disruption and disrespect in schools. 

The education watchdog said last month that misbehaviour was part of ‘everyday life’ in the classroom, with teachers estimating they lose up to an hour a day to indiscipline – equivalent to 38 days’ teaching a year.

Mr Cameron said he wanted all parents to have access to schools as good as the state primary his daughter Florence attends.

‘We all know the difference good teaching makes,’ he said. ‘The moment when an interest was sparked, a subject was mastered, or a career was inspired – these turning points can so often be traced back to one special teacher. 

'So I want every child in Britain to have access to great teaching.

‘It will remain my mission to give every parent that sense of security – the knowledge that their child’s education really is helping them to reach their potential and succeed in life.’

Mr Cameron will unveil the rescue package alongside Education Secretary Nicky Morgan today. The plans –not signed off by the Liberal Democrats – will be part of the Tory manifesto.

There are already eight ‘regional schools commissioners’ including ex-heads, who oversee free schools and academies. 

Regional schools commissioners can be sent into coasting schools, and will be given sweeping powers to implement new discipline codes, being in behaviour specialists, and dispose of failing staff

Teachers should take an oath to commit themselves to the values of their profession, says Labour’s Tristram Hunt.

The party’s education spokesman said it would be like the Hippocratic oath taken by doctors and would ‘elevate’ teachers’ status. 

But last night a Conservative spokesman dismissed the idea as a ‘patronising gimmick’.

Mr Hunt believes the practice would emphasise teachers’ responsibility ‘to provide a sense of moral purpose and virtue’ to pupils. 

He was inspired by an oath taken by teachers in Singapore.

Mr Cameron wants to expand their reach to immediate intervention in any state school deemed ‘inadequate’ by Ofsted.

The RSCs will be able to instruct schools to implement new policies on standards, discipline and leadership. Their new powers, which will cover 500 schools with 100,000 pupils, will be developed after consultation with teachers. 

They may include allowing RSCs to recommend a tariff of punishments for bad behaviour. Other ideas include bringing in behaviour specialists.

The experts could make immediate personnel changes to the governing body to improve the calibre of leadership and ensure it has the necessary skills to improve.

Mr Cameron will also announce that a Tory government will set up a National Teaching Service, a central pool of high-quality teachers who can be seconded to poor- performing schools.

Mrs Morgan said: ‘Labour failed an entire generation, breaking our education system … Our plan for education is clearing up Labour’s mess … targeting the schools where failure has become ingrained. 

'We will not tolerate failure, and where we find it we will use tried and trusted interventions to turn things around in the interests of young people everywhere.’

Mr Cameron added: ‘We want to build a Britain with an education system that helps our children reach their potential … That’s why we’re going to rescue 500 schools and help 100,000 children get new opportunities.’

Tristram Hunt, Labour’s education spokesman, said it was ‘this government’s damaging schools policy that has failed pupils’, adding that ministers were ‘trying to play catch-up’. 

'I want your children to have what Florence has, a top rate education in a brilliant state school'

Taking my four-year-old daughter Florence to school for the first time is something I won’t forget. 

All parents know that feeling – the apprehension as you let go of your child’s hand and watch them run across the playground towards their new friends.

But what gave me peace of mind, what made it a little easier to walk away, was knowing that Florence is being taught at a brilliant state primary school.

I want for your children what I have for my own, because no child in Britain should be born to have a second-rate education.

We have made good progress, with rigour in the curriculum, discipline in the classroom, and well-respected qualifications on exam certificates. Because these aren’t just letters on a piece of paper – they’re our children’s ticket to a better, brighter future.

Labour failed to do these things. Subjects like maths and English were dumbed down. The number of teenagers studying academic GCSEs, like science, halved. Businesses wouldn’t employ school leavers because they lacked basic skills.

And as countries like Singapore and Poland were raising the bar in education, Labour just moved the goalposts, making it twice as easy to get an A* or A – with nearly a quarter of all pupils achieving the top grades.

We are creating more good schools, freeing teachers from the constraints imposed by local councils and establishing 4,200 Academies.

We have helped 250 groups of parents, teachers, charities and businesses set up their own schools – Free Schools. We have toughened up the National Curriculum to make it truly rigorous.

And our plan is working: 800,000 more children are in good or outstanding schools; nearly 250,000 fewer are in failing schools. 

There are Free Schools that are sending as many pupils to Oxbridge as independent schools.

There are former failing schools which, as Academies, have become beacons of achievement. One is St Luke’s in Portsmouth. 

Fourteen years ago, not a single pupil achieved five A* to C grades at GCSE, including maths and English. Today, as an Academy, it boasts 68 per cent A* to C grades.

We know the ingredients of a great state school: great teachers, great leadership and an intolerance of failure – and freedom for those great teachers. Now we want to go further.

First, we will get more brilliant teachers into the schools that need them most. With programmes like Teach First, more top graduates are training to be teachers than ever before.

But we will go further. A National Teaching Fellowship will pay the best of the best to work in failing or inadequate schools. 

I want to see 1,500 of these top teachers signed up and in post by 2020. That means two in every school; every child within reach of first-class teaching.

We all know the difference good teaching makes. The moment when an interest was sparked, a subject was mastered, or a career was inspired – these turning points can so often be traced back to one special teacher.

'The moment when an interest was sparked, a subject was mastered, or a career was inspired - these turning points can so often be traced back to one special teacher'

Second, we will get to grips with failing schools. There are still too many in our country – 500 of them teaching 100,000 of our children. 

Currently there are eight regional school commissioners overseeing all Free Schools and Academies. We will give these experts, who include former teachers, a wider remit: unprecedented powers to overhaul failing schools.

If it’s the leadership that’s not working, they can make them remove it – reappointing the whole governing body if they have to. If the curriculum isn’t up to scratch, they can change it.

They can issue new disciplinary measures for bad behaviour. They can pair up failing schools with good local schools. And if they succeed, we will look at what they can do for schools that are said to ‘require improvement’ – what I call coasting schools.

When it comes to our children’s education, we don’t have a year to waste. Every day a school fails is a day too long. So these measures will happen fast.

After her first month at school, Florence is coming home every day repeating things she has heard her teacher say, excited to learn more.

It will remain my mission to give every parent that sense of security – the knowledge that their child’s education really is helping them to reach their potential and succeed in life.
