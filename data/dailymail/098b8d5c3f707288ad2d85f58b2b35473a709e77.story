If Prince Harry has ever regretted calling things off with Florence Brudenell-Bruce, he had better look away now.

The 25-year-old actress and model shows off her best assets as the new face - and incredibly toned body - of lingerie brand's Rigby & Peller's new swimwear range.

The label has called on the leggy blonde model to celebrate its 75th anniversary by showcasing the SS14 capsule collection.

The one that got away? Florence Brudenell-Bruce, Prince Harry's ex, is the new face of Rigby & Peller's swimwear range

Shot on location in the Bahamas by photographer Eddie Wrey, the collection is inspired by the vibrancy of Brazil, paying homage to the bright allure of the country's tropical flora and fauna, according to the brand.

Split into two ranges, Florianopolis and Maracana, the pieces are made up of corals, purples inspired by Brazil’s famous Acai berries, and eye-catching florals, each created exclusively for Rigby & Peller.

Rigby & Peller say the 
collection, which launches in April, has been carefully designed to 
offer maximum support and comfort with a flattering forward uplift, 
enhancing natural assets and ensuring you look your best at all times - 
and it's working for Florence.

Well-educated and from a close-knit family, Florence - nicknamed Flee - is the youngest of four children of Old Etonian wine merchant Andrew and his French wife Sophie.

Scouted by a model agency at age 15 coming out of Topshop, Florence finished her A-levels at Stowe school (at the behest of her parents) before going on to model in her gap year, landing a campaign for Adidas in America, vamping up John Lewis' image with a swimwear campaign, and posing in Elizabeth Hurley's designs.

She also completed a History of Art degree at Bristol University.

Naturally slim, she never diets and adores baking. Florence follows her French mother’s advice on healthy eating: have a good breakfast, lunch and dinner with little snacking in between, and the metabolism will regulate itself, she says.

The day before a fashion shoot she avoids large meals; on the shoot she sips ginger tea from a flask, then in the evening enjoys a Thai soup: ‘If food is spicy, it feels good for you,' she says.

New man: Flee married Henry Edward Hugh St George, grandson of the Marchese di San Georgio and maternal grandson of the 11th Duke of Grafton, last year

Her relationship with Prince Harry is thought to have begun in 2011.

The
 couple, who had been friends for years, apparently became an item 
after Harry confirmed that his relationship with Chelsy Davy was over 
for good.

The new couple are said to have 
enjoyed a series of encounters at Florence's £2.5million home in Notting
Hill, west London.

Florence, a
descendant of the seventh Earl of Cardigan who led the Charge of the 
Light Brigade, previously dated Formula 1 racing driver Jenson Button.

But in July 2013 she married Henry Edward Hugh St George, grandson of the Marchese di San Georgio and maternal grandson of the 11th Duke of Grafton.

In an interview with Tatler magazine, Florence revealed that she is keen to embark upon a new career at some point, as 'one day everything will drop and I won’t be able to earn my living in a bikini.'

But, judging by her latest gig, that day hasn't come just yet.

Model behaviour: Florence, who 
has a History of Art degree from Bristol University, has modelled for 
names including Knickerbox at Ann Summers
