Shoplifter Danny from Channel 4 documentary Benefits Street

Channel 4 was facing a police probe last night over a documentary featuring a thief showing how to shoplift.

Detectives are considering whether to investigate the criminal activities seen in the programme on welfare claimants.

The prolific shoplifter explains how to dodge security alarms and how to remove security tags from designer clothes without causing damage.

More than 200 complaints were made to Channel 4 and the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom after Benefits Street aired on Monday night.

Residents in a deprived Birmingham road were filmed making false welfare claims and growing cannabis in their homes. John O’Shea, a Labour councillor in the city, said: ‘Channel 4 appear to have aided and abetted shoplifting in Birmingham.’

Superintendent Danny Long, of West Midlands Police, said: ‘We have been inundated with comments from members of the public, many of whom are concerned about elements of the show which showed criminal activity.

‘We are assessing whether the content of the programme can assist  us as part of any investigations or indeed whether any new inquiries should be launched in light of the material that has been broadcast.’

The programme explores day-to-day life in James Turner Street, Winson Green, where, it is claimed, as many as 90 per cent of people claim benefits.

Shoplifter ‘Danny’ is seen brandishing a cardboard shopping bag which he has lined with a Primark paper bag covered in foil to stop security alarms going off inside stores.

Another resident, called ‘Fungi’, is seen going into a Premier Inn hotel where he picks up four magazines and tries to hawk them for £2.50 each, calling them ‘his Big Issue’.

Patrol: Police were on James Turner Street in Birmingham today as it emerged that officers will review whether there should be arrests after what was shown on the programme

Inquiries: An officer knocks at a door on 'Benefits Street', where it is believed 90 per cent are unemployed and survive on benefits

In trouble: On last night's show a man called Danny discussed stealing jackets from a shop in the Bullring shopping centre and was later arrested

Cameras follow him making a sale to a 
woman in a smart black sports car. Evidently fooled, she gives him £3 
and tells him to keep the change. He makes £12.

Danny
 later returns from a shopping centre having apparently stolen five 
jackets which he claims he can sell for £250. On the bus home, he shows 
viewers how to remove the security tags without damaging the clothes.

Fungi
 beams: ‘This guy is one of the best shoplifters I have ever met in my 
life. This is James Turner street, this is how we’ve got to earn our 
money.’

After making £200 in an afternoon, Danny then calls a drug dealer to order ‘two bags and a shot’.

Another
 resident, Dee Roberts, 32, says: ‘If there’s somebody around and 
they’re going to sell you a £120 pair of jeans for a tenner you aren’t 
going to say no are you, do you know what I mean, it’s like their way of
 living.’

Accusations: People on the street say the Channel 4 show has manipulated them and made their area look like a slum

Criticism: Residents say they mistakenly believed the show was about the strength of the community on James Turner Street, but producers say they simply filmed what they saw, which appears to include criminality

Yesterday it 
emerged the jobless youth worker was arrested last summer on suspicion 
of possessing Class B drugs with intent to supply. She has not been 
charged and protests her innocence.

Her home was among four James Turner Street properties searched by police on June 14.

Police
 said a number of bullets were recovered from one property while a haul 
of illegal substances, believed to be cocaine and cannabis, and a large 
amount of cash were also seized.

During
 the programme, a man wearing a black tracksuit, gloves and a full face 
mask is seen tending a number of cannabis plants. He says: ‘Basically 
everyone does something on the side when they’re on benefits, it can be 
from selling tobacco to going shoplifting.’

A
 young couple who live on the street, Mark and Becky, told the 
film-makers they had all their benefits stopped because of fraudulent 
claims.

Mark said at one point they were picking up £1,500 a month for them and their two young children.

‘Me and Becky, to tell you the truth, we were doing benefit fraud and was picking up easily £1,500 a month,’ he said.

Raids: Police say they seized a number of bullets from one property while a 'substantial' haul of substances, believed to be cocaine and cannabis, and a large amount of cash were also seized from the street

‘They
 stopped everything. I can see why people go out robbing and do time 
inside, it pays to be inside – there’s nothing out here.’

Upset: People who live on James Turner Street, including  Dee Roberts and friend Charlene Wilson (right), are unhappy about how they are being portrayed

Channel 4 said it had received around 100 complaints and Ofcom is thought to have received a similar number.

Viewers
 were concerned about how crime and benefits claimants were portrayed in
 the programme, which had an audience of 4.3million.

The
 broadcaster said the series, filmed over more than a year, was a ‘fair 
reflection of the reality of life on a street where the majority of 
households receive benefits’.

On
 the alleged criminal activity, it said: ‘The production crew were 
filming in a purely observational capacity – at no stage was criminal 
behaviour encouraged or condoned.

‘All
 contributors were briefed that if they carried out criminal activity on
 camera this could result in criminal investigations after broadcast.’

Channel 4 insisted the programme-makers were careful not to show viewers how to commit crime. Ofcom said it would assess the complaints it received.

Yesterday residents featured in the documentary claimed they had been ‘turned over’ by Channel 4.

Polish-born
 Anna Korzen, 28, has lived on the street for four years with her two 
children. She rakes in £900 a month in tax credits, child benefit and 
housing benefit.

Miss Korzen said: ‘Everyone on the street is so angry, so am I. We have been made to look like tramps.’

The programme also prompted abusive messages and death threats on Twitter, aimed at the programme’s participants.

One person tweeted: ‘Set fire to £Benefits Street.’

The
 British Retail Consortium said in a statement: ‘Shoplifting is far from
 victimless: it affects shops and staff, impacts directly on communities
 and can encourage wider criminal activity.’

Not impressed: Mark Thomas, 23 and Becky Howe, 23, say producers of Channel 4's Benefits Street have made residents look like 'slums'

Shoplifter Danny from Channel 4 documentary Benefits Street

'Danny' – thought to be Danny Smith – was the catalyst for most of the complaints to the police.

The qualified gym instructor was shown lining a paper shopping bag with tin foil to stop store alarms from sounding during a shoplifting spree. 

‘Fill it up with a £2,000 coat or whatever you ****ing want, you’ll walk out of the shop and you’re coming out with no alarms going off’, he said.

Smith, a father of three who admitted being too lazy to work, went shoplifting just days after being released from prison.

Although cameras did not record him taking any goods, he was filmed afterwards boasting about  his haul of five designer jackets – which he then sold for £200. His criminal record stretches to around 200 offences.

He has been convicted 80 times since the age of 12.

Subject to an Asbo banning him from Birmingham city centre, he was arrested after venturing back to the shops on another thieving mission.

He was also verbally abusive to the police and community support officers who picked him up.

The programme ended with Danny vanishing after apparently stealing cannabis plants a neighbour was growing in a spare bedroom.

Deirdre Kelly – or ‘White Dee’ – boasted of being the ‘mother of the street’ in the first episode.

She was filmed advising neighbour ‘Black Dee’ not to panic when she was served with an eviction notice.

And she told an alcoholic neighbour threatened with having his benefits suspended that she ignored a similar letter ‘and they were still paid’.

Viewers were told the 42-year-old was struggling to bring up two children on benefits and there was no sign of a partner.

However, her Facebook page, which is littered with photographs of family holidays and outings to pop concerts, states she is ‘in a relationship’.

Although of Irish extraction, Miss Kelly has lived in Birmingham since childhood.

She revels in her ‘mother of the street’ image – even using an email address which starts ‘momma_d’.

She claimed people were now growing drugs in their spare bedrooms to fund or – as she put it ‘accommodate’ – the bedroom tax.

When challenged by the Daily Mail she said her remarks had been made in jest.

Dee Roberts, who has not worked for six years, complained that she was duped into appearing in the programme

Dee Roberts, who has not worked for six years, complained that she was duped into appearing in the programme.

The 32-year-old – known as ‘Black Dee’ – said residents thought that the show was about a close working class community, but had instead been portrayed as  ‘complete scum’.

She is on bail in connection with at least two offences.

Roberts was arrested on suspicion of possessing Class B drugs with intent to supply following a summer raid.

Yesterday police swooped on her home after she failed to answer bail in relation to a ‘racially aggravated incident’ on the road in August.

She was filmed turning to Miss Kelly for support after being threatened with eviction for non-payment of rent, addressing her namesake as ‘mother’.
