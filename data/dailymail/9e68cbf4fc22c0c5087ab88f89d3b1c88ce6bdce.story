On trial: Pc Matthew Fisher at Hull Crown Court

A married police constable had sex with his girlfriend in a police van and used the police national computer to track three women to chase, a jury heard today.

Twice-married Pc Matthew Fisher, 37, allegedly spent four years coaxing sexual favours from five different women through his role as a police officer, sometimes refusing to take no for an answer, Hull Crown Court heard.

He would make flirting remarks, grab their hands and place them on his genitals, and try to look down their top while on pay from North Yorkshire Police, it is alleged.

He met two women by offering them lifts home in a police van.

Prosecutors claim he looked up the mobile numbers on police databases for three women when he had no professional reason to do so.

Fisher, of Selby, is accused of four charges of sexual assault, one charge of attempted rape and a charge of misconduct in public office by accessing the police national computer and using a police radio for personal communication. He denies the charges.

He has admitted two charges of misconduct in public office.

One relates to having sexual contact in a police van outside of Selby Bus Station.

The other relates to having consensual sexual contact with woman he met in while she was on a night out and he gave her a lift home in a police van.

Crown barrister Simon Waley told the jury the allegations arose from his work as a police officer in the Selby area and had spiraled from two to four complaints when girls read he had been charged, but some of the sexual contact was consensual.

Mr Waley said Fisher would meet the women as victims of crime or patrolling and befriend them before beginning to flirt and offer his sexual services - usually in their own homes.

'He has targeted women he wished to have sexual contact with and in some instances has tracked down their personal details using police information systems,' said Mr Waley.

'With some of these women the sexual contact which followed was consensual (they are not charged).

With others he forced his sexual intentions on them, confident in the belief that they wouldn't bring themselves to report him - for example that they had been the victim of an offence that he was there to assist them with or that they had criminal records which made them think that they would never be believed over a police officer or simply that they were drunk, the court heard.

'In each instance he was content to take advantage of those vulnerabilities.'

Mr Waley said the first woman would tell the jury she was dependent on heroin and Pc Fisher had gone to a shared flat where she had been drinking to ask her to turn down music.

She said he took her home, drunk in his police car and when they reached her address he started some flirtatious conversation

He grabbed her hand to his manhood the woman said she swore at him pulled her hand away and made to get out the car.

'He asked her not to tell anyone and that he was getting engaged soon,' said Mr Waley.

The second woman called him to help her after being assaulted by her partner. She said he asked her to demonstrate how she was assaulted.

She said Fisher had said: 'You're not wearing any knickers.' She commented she did not think that was very professional.

She said he make an excuse to use her toilet and came out into her bedroom with his trousers undone.

She told police he grabbed her, pushing her on to a bed, trying to kiss her.

'She was asking him what he was doing and telling him to stop,' said Mr Waley.

He told the court Fisher tried to make her perform a sex act after taking off his protective vest.

Eventually he gave up and said to her: 'I know things about you, so you're not going to tell on me are you?'

Mr Waley said the third woman they would hear from needed police help, after her son was involved in an incident.

He made repeated home visits on duty. 'He often made sexual comments to her and she describes him pulling at her top and looking down at her breasts on more than one occasion,' said Mr Waley.

'She said on one occasion Pc Fisher gave her a lift home in a police van and sat of her sofa before unzipping his trousers. She asked him what he was doing as there were children in the house.'

She said on a further occasion he had arrived at her home when she was putting make up on ready to go out when he backed her into a kitchen corner.

'He put one hand onto her upper body and with his other hand he took hers and placed it on his groin,' said Mr Waley.

'She pulled her hand away but she had foundation on her hand which left a mark on his trousers.'

Mr Waley said the fourth complainant met Fisher on a night out in Selby when he when he pulled up in a police van and offered her a lift home.

She was happy to go along with it and gave him her phone number and when they got to her house he kissed her. He used his police radio to call her and Mr Waley said the pair had consensual sexual contact one or two weeks later.

'You should not he has pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office to reflect the fact in the course of his duties he called on this lady to have sexual contact.'

Mr Waley said in total Pc Fisher made 52 attempts to contact her using both is police radio and personal mobile.

Mr Waley said in March last year Fisher was interviewed about the allegations made by two women and in prepared statement denied he assaulted them in anyway.

Enquires were made into Pc Fisher's use of police systems and his personal contacts. Mr Waley said Fisher accessed a police date base for three women - obtaining their personal mobiles and then calling them.

'One has given a statement in which she says that Pc Fisher had admitted he had 'taken the liberty of looking her up' with respect to her number and car details.

Mr Waley said Fisher first struck up a relationship with this fifth women he met in a supermarket and had consensual sexual contact with her in a police van outside Selby Bus Station.

He said: 'Matthew Fisher has entered a guilty plea to misconduct in public office with having sex in a police van.'

Mr Waley said in interview Pc Fisher accepted he had carried out checks, but could not recall details of those checks.

When interviewed about the other two women he accepted knowing one as a victim of crime and attended her house on police business, but denied any sexual remarks or misconduct

Instead he said she behaved flirtatiously to him exposing herself and asking him when they would have sexual relations.

The trial continues.
