The Navy SEAL who claims he killed Osama bin Laden says he shot the terrorist a third time 'just for luck.'

Robert O'Neill, who was unmasked last week by MailOnline as 'The Shooter', had been trained to use two head shots during missions - known in military circles as a double tap.

However, according to the New York Post, he told families of 9/11 victims there was 'no harm in putting one more bullet in him.'

What's done is done: Bin Laden shooter Robert O'Neill (above) said: 'He (Bin Laden] died afraid, and he knew we were there to kill him. And that's closure'

Under fire: This comes as many are attacking O'Neill for making his identity as a Navy SEAL public

According to the paper, he made the comments during a secret meeting at the memorial museum at the World Trade Center site in July.

Describing the night of the raid, he said that he didn't know who 'The Target' was going into the mission. 

Before his unit set off, he had time to make one, last phone call to his children, fearing he may never see them again.

He recalled how he climbed into bin Laden's compound, walked upstairs and heard. His weapon then went: 'Pop! Pop! Pop!'

The audience, all relatives of people who died in the attacks on the Twin Towers had no idea they would be receiving a first hand account of how the mastermind was killed.

Initially they were invited to a 'private and confidential' event that included a talk by a 'mystery speaker'.  

Last week, following his first televised interview, he said: 'He (Bin Laden] died afraid, and he knew we were there to kill him. And that's closure.' 

Down: O'Neill says of what happened, that anyone who questions him can only ask one other person what really happened, Osama bin Laden (above), and he's dead

O'Neill  opened up about his meeting with the relatives of the 9/11 terror attacks saying: '[O]ne thing I tell them is all right, Osama bin Laden died like a p****.That's all I'm telling you. Just so you know.'

This was all revealed in a series of recorded interviews O'Neill had with journalist Alex Quade that were aired on Friday's AC360. 

He added that it doesn't matter who ultimately took down the terrorist. 

'The most important thing that I've learned in the last two years is to me it doesn't matter anymore if I am The Shooter,' O'Neill said.

'Regardless of the negativity that comes with it, I don't give a f***. We got him.' 

Site: O'Neill also revealed that he and his fellow Navy SEALs did not think they would return alive after the raid on bin Laden's hideout (above)

He also revealed in these interviews that he and his fellow SEALs did not think they would make it out alive after raiding bin Laden's hideout. 

'Well, you have to go pump yourself up to go die. So we would talk about this,' O'Neill said of their acknowledgement that this would likely be the end for them.

'(It was a) group of guys who knew time on Earth was up, so you could be honest with each other. And we all accepted and nobody was afraid. It was really cool.'

O'Neill's move to go public has been met with mixed response, and heavily criticzed among his fellow SEALs.

He sees it differently however, pointing out how films like Captain Phillips and Zero Dark Thirty both made his work very public, and that high ranking officials have no spoken openly about both incidents.

'Once anyone says anything at that level, it's not classified,' he said.

'I was told by people that I can't even say I'm a Navy SEAL, so I don't give a f*** what they think.'

Public guy: O'Neill seems fine with his detractors these days in interviews, saying he doesn't care if people think he is 'full of s***'

As for those who question him, he is not letting it bother him.

'Even now, I mean, there are guys now saying that I am full of s***,' he said.

'You only know what you were told unless you were in the room. And unfortunately for me, there was two people in the room, and one of us is dead and that's Osama bin Laden.' 

O'Neill is due to appear in a two-part documentary on Fox News next week, detailing his part in the killing of bin Laden.

MailOnline exclusively disclosed his identity ahead of the broadcast.

O’Neill has already described the night of May 2, 2011 in an interview with Sharon Stone’s ex-husband Phil Bronstein that appeared in Esquire magazine in February 2013. But his name was not revealed at that time and he was referred to only as ‘the Shooter.’

Now his identity has become public, military leaders and fellow SEALs are lining up to discredit his version of events.

Donation: O'Neill gave his SEAL team uniform the museum at the memorial to the September 11 terror attacks in New York after meeting relatives of the victims of bin Laden's atrocity. It was then that he decided to tell the wider public that he was 'The Shooter'

Speaking success: O'Neill is now a high-profile member of the motivational speaking circuit, openly revealing that he was a SEAL - but until now not declaring that he was involved in the daring raid which killed bin Laden

A former SEAL Team 6 commander told the New York Times O’Neill only fired ‘insurance shots’ into bin Laden’s twitching body after the terror leader had already been mortally shot by an unidentified SEAL who is still in the service.

That hero is described as the ’point man’ who led the SEALs up the stairs in bin Laden’s compound to the bedroom where he was hiding.

Another Team 6 member also disputed O’Neill’s version, saying the 'point man' had wounded bin Laden with a shot to the side, and then grabbed the women in the room for fear they were wearing explosives. O’Neill, he said, had then finished Osama off.

And Reuters quoted an unidentified source close to a SEAL Team 6 member as saying the fatal shot was fired by one of two other men who entered the room before O'Neill. 

But O’Neill told Bronstein last year: ‘I shot him, two times in the forehead. Bap! Bap! The second time as he's going down. He crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and I hit him again, Bap! same place. That time I used my EOTech red-dot holo sight. He was dead. Not moving. His tongue was out. I watched him take his last breaths, just a reflex breath.’

One SEAL source told MailOnline: 'The real shooter would never discuss it publicly.

'Members of SEAL Team Six haven’t discussed it publicly so there’s a reasonable chance he’s not being truthful.

'There is no way O’Neill could really prove it was he who took the fatal shot on Osama bin Laden unless his comrades all attested to it.

'But again, the code of secrecy with these special operators would preclude that.'
