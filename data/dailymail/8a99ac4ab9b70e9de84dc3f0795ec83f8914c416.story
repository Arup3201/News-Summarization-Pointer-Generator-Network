Peter Maine, who was found with fatal stab wounds after going for a run along the River Wear in Durham city centre in September 2013 

The fatal stabbing of a solicitor still remains a mystery after police investigated 65 people who may have wanted to harm him, an inquest has ruled.

The body of Peter Maine, 56, was found after he went for a run along the River Wear after parking his car in Durham city centre in September 2013.

He was discovered with stab wounds and detectives had been investigating whether he was targeted by a killer, was the victim of a random attack, or inflicted the fatal injuries himself.

Today, an inquest in Crook, County Durham, also heard that Mr Maine of Wynyard, Teesside, was facing a charge of conspiracy to defraud and under investigation by the Solicitors Regulation Authority following a complaint by a client.

Detective Chief Inspector Steve Chapman, who led the inquiry into the married father-of-two’s death, said officers looked at 65 people who may have had recent contact with Mr Maine and may have had reason to want to harm him.

But those investigations drew a blank and robbery was ruled out as a motive as he was found with his Rolex watch, wallet and keys.

Coroner Andrew Tweddle asked: 'It is fair to say, there is not anybody who might be of interest to you, or might be considered a potential suspect, being involved directly or indirectly?'

Mr Chapman agreed, saying: 'My initial hypothesis was it was murder and it was planned, murder and it was unplanned, or it was suicide.'

Police managed to trace all but two people seen walking or running in the area of the river between 7.30am and 8.30am that day.

Neither of the two outstanding people were of particular concern to police, Mr Chapman said.

They also searched the Wear and its banks for the weapon used to stab Mr Maine with the three-month search of the water cost £30,000.

None of the six knives found in the general area were believed to have been the one used to inflict the fatal injuries, the inquest heard.

After his body was discovered near the Maiden Castle Sports Centre, police scoured the area looking for clues into Mr Maine's death

Mr Maine’s widow, Joanna, also told the court how the family had planned for the future and there was nothing unusual in her husband's behaviour to suggest anything was wrong.

Mrs Maine, who had met her husband 30 years ago and agreed she knew him better than anyone, said: “We had just booked a holiday. When the news came, I was on the phone to my daughter and I was so surprised.

'I have spent months trying to think of things that could have been an indication as to what happened, but there is nothing.'

Recording an open verdict, the coroner Mr Tweddle added: 'Whether it was murder, homicide or a case where Peter Maine intentionally took his own life, I have to be sure of the verdict, that it supports the conclusion.

'It has to be clear to anyone today that I cannot be sure that either of the things are appropriate conclusions.'

Family spokesman Tim Gittins read a statement after the hearing.

After the hearing in Crook, County Durham today, the Maine family solicitor Tim Gittens, left, and Detective Chief Inspector of Durham Police Steve Chapman read out statements 

He said: 'After 16 months and at the end of a long and thorough investigation by Durham Constabulary and the inquest, we still do not know what happened to Peter on the morning of September 1 2013 which is a burden that our family and friends will most likely have to carry for the rest of our lives.

'Peter was a good and kind man who was very much loved by his family and friends. He is greatly missed and we will all continue to grieve our loss.'

Mr Maine’s body was found near Maiden Castle sports centre, around 40 metres from the site of significant blood drops in the middle of a bridge over the Wear.

He had left the family home on the wealthy estate of Wynyard, near Billingham and took his Range Rover up the A1M to Durham and visited his former offices on Old Elvet, which were to be made into student lets.

CCTV showed him jogging from the property along the river bank and he was last spotted on camera alive at 7.42am. A member of the public called the emergency services at 8.01am.
