Searching for clues to the recent decline of Angel di Maria, the break-in that occurred at his house in January cannot be overlooked. Di Maria’s form had dropped off before that, true, but not as alarmingly as it has in recent weeks. He wasn’t getting hooked at half-time before this event.

Alvaro Negredo suffered a similarly shattering blow that ended his family’s love for their new country. He was not the same player after it happened. Di Maria is believed to be relocating his family to a new, high-level apartment following their traumatic experience.

Alvaro Negredo had a tough time at Manchester City and left for Valencia

Negredo has returned to Spain on loan with Valencia 

The player would not be human if he was unaffected, particularly as - like Negredo - he is still learning to speak English and must already feel quite alone. Manchester City came to the conclusion that Negredo was lost to them, and only a return to Spain would solve his problems.

Manchester United may decide this is also the case with Di Maria — but have so much more to lose, financially, if he departs at the end of the season.
