Costa Rica coach Jorge Luis Pinto insists they will not be taking it easy against England in their final World Cup Group D match despite already securing qualification.

Bryan Ruiz's header against Italy secured a 1-0 win for the Ticos who will qualify for the last 16 even if they lose to England in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday.

Pinto, Costa Rica's Colombian coach, said he is now targeting finishing first in the group.

He said: 'Of course we want to win the next match now and I must ask my players to keep calm and play just as well.

Italy coach Cesare Prandelli admitted two missed chances by Mario Balotelli had proved costly.

He said: 'Mario played well in the first half, had two chances and if he had scored then the game would have been different.

'We came into this game with too slow a pace, and Costa Rica were well-organised and so our approach was not of the best.'

Asked if he had a message for England, who had been relying on an Italian victory, Prandelli added: 'I am terribly sorry not just for the English but also for us as we wanted to win.

'Now we will have to play well against Uruguay in order to qualify. We knew this was a particularly challenging and difficult group, and now we have to try to recover our energy for the Uruguay game in four days.'
