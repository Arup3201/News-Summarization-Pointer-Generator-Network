Manchester United striker Robin van Persie took to Twitter to thank fans who wished him a happy birthday.

The Dutch captain posed with his two children and two balloons showing the number 31, and tweeted the message 'Thanks everybody for all your birthday wishes'.

Unlike another famous footballer based in Manchester, Van Persie was also presented with a personalised birthday cake by club staff.

Van Persie has returned to Manchester this week after an extended break following the World Cup, and is tipped as a possible captain for the Old Trafford side.

He is expected to miss United's first game of the season, at home to Swansea on August 16, but should be fit to start for Louis van Gaal's team after that.
