A former child actress who played Mel Gibson's young daughter in the 2000 film The Patriot died July 19 in part as a result of huffing, Texas Authorities revealed Monday.

Tests reveal 21-year-old actress Skye McCole Bartusiak had muscle relaxers, painkillers and a chemical refrigerant difluoroethane in her system at the time of her death, reports TMZ.

Her death has been ruled an accidental overdose likely caused by the mixture of Vicodin, the muscle relaxant carisoprodol and the refrigerant often abused as an inhalant.

Bartusiak was best known for her role in Gibson's Revolutionary War epic The Patriot, where she played the daughter of militia leader Benjamin Martin who struggles to speak with her father. 

Bartusiak's mother, Helen Bartusiak, told The Associated Press the actress had been living in a garage apartment at her parents' Houston home. 

She said the actress' boyfriend found her there unresponsive on her bed.

Helen Bartusiak said she tried to resuscitate her daughter but could not. She said at the time that the actress had been healthy and did not drink or do drugs.

'We think she had a seizure and choked and nobody was there,' Bartusiak told CNN shortly after her daughter's death.

Difluoroethane is a chemical found in products such as canned 'Duster' type sprays.

According to the New Jersey Department of Health, it is 'colorless and odorless gas used as a liquefied compressed gas. It is used as a cooling agent, as an aerosol propellant and in the manufacture of other chemicals.'

Difluoroethane is sometimes abused for its 'euphoric' effects, but has been known to cause accidental death in those who inhale it.

It is also flammable and a known cancer-causing agent.

Her mother said:

'We lost our girl,She was a kind and really beautiful girl.'

Bartusiak made her acting debut in the television miniseries Storm of the Century in 1999 and also had a role on 24 in 2002-2003.

She made her film debut in the The Cider House Rules in 1999 and starred with Michael Douglas in Don't Say a Word in 2001. Her most recent move was Sick Boy in 2012. 

The Patriot cast also included Heath Ledger, who died after an accidental overdose of painkillers and sedatives in 2008.
