A specialist food crime unit should be set up to investigate fraud in the wake of the horsemeat scandal, an official inquiry said yesterday.

To date, no individual or company has been prosecuted as a result of the discovery that millions of beef burgers and other products contained high levels of horsemeat.

A government-commissioned probe has now found that the UK food supply system is ‘too vulnerable’ to criminals and has called for a major overhaul of the Food Standards Agency (FSA) – which was criticised over the way it and the Government handled the scandal.

Professor Chris Elliott, of the Institute for Global Food Security at Queen’s University Belfast, said not enough evidence is collected about crime in the UK’s £188billion food and drink market.

As well as a unit to investigate serious fraud, he said there should be fresh guidance for catering companies to ensure they check the authenticity of food.

He warned: ‘Estimates of the level of criminality vary, so further investigation needs to be a priority.

We need a culture within businesses involved in supplying food that focuses on depriving those who seek to deceive consumers. Government, and in particular a more robust Food Standards Agency has a major role to play.’

There was confusion when the horsemeat scandal emerged in January as to which official bodies – the FSA, Defra or local councils – were responsible and what action should be taken.

Prof Elliott said the FSA needed an up-to-date ‘crisis management plan’ and must work more closely with government departments to ensure their respective roles are clear during a ‘major incident’.

The FSA has so far effectively passed responsibility to police and local councils, which either do not have experience or the power to deal with the  issue.

Yesterday, the FSA said it has already introduced measures to counter food fraud, while Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said work would  continue to ‘improve intelligence’.
