Pope Francis has called on Roma gipsies to ‘contribute to the common good’.

He lamented that travelling communities rarely participate in political or economic society.

‘Gipsies are often at the margins of society, and sometimes are viewed with hostility and suspicion,’ he said.

‘The gipsy people are also called on to contribute to the common good.’

The pontiff acknowledged that there were reasons for the lack of participation, including poverty and prejudice.

Italy, which has a large Roma population, has seen clashes between local and gipsy communities.

In March hundreds fled one of the country’s largest camps near Naples after a mob attacked them, following an alleged attempted rape of an Italian girl.

Zeljko Jovanovic, a Roma spokesman said: ‘The Pope’s statements challenging the exclusion of Roma  are hugely important.’
