Paul Pogba gave Didier Deschamps' side the lead in their last 16 clash with a late header. Click here to view his goal.

Arsene Wenger would have been an interested spectator in Brasilia on Monday.

He was, of course, keeping an eye on Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud, who was a surprise starter for the clash against Nigeria.

But Wenger, working for French TV in Brazil, would also have been keeping close tabs on Karim Benzema, Mathieu Debuchy and Antoine Griezmann.

The trio are targets for the Gunners this season. Newcastle right-back Debuchy is a more realistic target for Wenger, as he continues with his attempts to replace Bacary Sagna.

Benzema is a long-term target for Wenger, but looks set to sign a new deal at Real Madrid, while Griezmann will cost big money to lure away from Real Sociedad.

Blaise Matuidi has been one of France's stars of Brazil 2014 so far.

But how did he get away with his reckless challenge on Ogenyi Onazi that caused the Nigerian to be stretchered off?

Star man: France's little wizard Mathieu Valbuena ran the show as 'les bleus' reached the quarter-finals

Tres bien: Coach Didier Deschamps acknowledges his playmaker after France sealed the victory

Engine: Blaise Matuidi, surrounded by three Nigerians, was a livewire in central midfield

Fortunate: Matuidi was fortunate to only be shown a yellow card after a nasty tackle on Ogenyi Onazi

Surely, the French would have been down to 10 men if referee Mike Geiger had the benefit of a TV replay.

Efe Ambrose has been a mainstay of Nigeria's defence during the World Cup.

And perhaps we'll be hearing more about him next season.

His performances have alerted a number of Premier League clubs, including Crystal Palace and Leicester.

He currently plays for Scottish champions Celtic.

Impressive: Efe Ambrose, of Celtic and Nigeria, was excellent at right-back as Nigeria put up a brave fight

Eyes on the prize: Paul Pogba (left) scored in the 79th minute for France from a corner vs Nigeria

Joseph Yobo made his 10th World Cup appearance in Brasilia, a new Nigerian record.

But the centre-half, who spent the back end of last season on loan at Norwich from Fenerbache, won't remember his red-letter day with much fondness as his side crashed out of the tournament and scored an own goal to boot.

Yohan Cabaye's brilliant half-volley in the second half that rattled off the Nigerian crossbar was the sixth time France have hit the woodwork during the World Cup - the most of any other team.

Close but no cigar: Pogba (left) nearly put Les Bleus ahead in the first-half but with a sweetly-struck volley

Technique: Juventus midfielder Pogba is highly-sought after by some of Europe's finest clubs

Mathieu Debuchy - The Newcastle right-back continued his fine tournament. Solid display. 6.5

Laurent Koscielny - Goes from strength to strength. Developing a reputation as one of Europe's best. 7

Patrice Evra - His experience was vital, but struggled at times. 6

Yohan Cabaye - Kept things ticking along nicely in midfield and was unlucky with a long-ranger. 6.5

Blaise Matuidi - Brilliant engine. Important defensively and offensively for the French. 7

Paul Pogba - Lively in central midfield and rewarded with his late winner. 7.5

Mathieu Valbuena - A workhorse down the right-hand side and his delivery from wide was wicked at times. 8

Karim Benzema - Shifted out to the left and didn't look happy until moving back inside. 6.5

NIGERIA (4-2-3-1)

Ogenyi Onazi - Played an important role in protecting his back-four before being forced off with injury. 7

Jon Obi Mikel - Influential for the Nigerian's but a tad slow with his passing at times. 6.5

Ahmed Musa - Nigeria's danger man couldn't provide the same impact he did against Argentina. 6

Victor Moses - Floated in and out of the match and could stamp his quality on the game. 6

Peter Odemwingie - Dwelled on the ball too much and nearly cost his side on various occasions. 5.5
