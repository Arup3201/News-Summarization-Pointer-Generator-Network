The jury panel in the murder trial of a 20-year-old Florida college student accused of strangling to death his romantic rival was shown today grisly images of the suspect’s blood-spattered SUV, which prosecutors believe served as the crime scene.

Pedro Bravo is charged with murdering Christian Aguilar, 18, a University of Florida student, and dumping his body in the woods in September 2012 as part of a plot to reunite with his high school girlfriend, who was dating the victim.

On Friday, prosecutors put up on the screen in court images showing the interior of Bravo's blue Chevy Blazer smeared with blood.

Crime scene technicians who examined the SUV back in 2012 discovered scrapes on the ceiling and a cracked windshield along with blood stains.

Also today the court heard from forensic documenting expert Thomas Vastrick, who examined Bravo's journals containing hate-filled writings about Aguilar and love letters inspired by Erika Friman, his former girlfriend.

The handwritten diary included a suicide note penned by the Santa Fe College student.

Next to 
take the stand on Day 5 of the trial was Timothy Peck, an officer with 
the University of Florida Police Department who was the first law 
enforcement official to encounter Bravo, Local10 reported.

Peck
 testified that the then-18-year-old man walked into a police station on
 his own to report Aguilar, his high school friend, missing.

‘He was very cooperative and very wanting to assist in helping to find him,’ Peck recalled.

But
 according to the campus cop, he sensed that something was amiss because
 Bravo allegedly offered conflicting versions of what went on between 
him and Aguilar.

Initially,
 the suspect admitted to getting into a verbal argument with the 
18-year-old UF student, but he later changed his story, saying that the 
two came to blows.

After the interview, Peck called Aguilar's father in Miami and expressed concern that Bravo may have done something to his son.

Aguilar's remains were eventually found by two hunters, James Rains and Jesse Everidge, out looking for jasmine vines in a pine forest in Levy County.

Rains and Everidge took the stand Friday describing the moment they came upon Aguilar's skull lying face down in a small clearing, Gainesville.com reported.

The hunters told the court that initially they smelled something putrid and followed the scent to the burial site.

'Something caught my nose,' Everidge said. 'We found what we smelled. What caught my eye as strange was the roundness of the bone that I could see.'

On
 Thursday, prosecutors presented in court more graphic evidence, 
including a weaved belt they said Bravo had used to throttle his rival.

Jurors
 also got to see a photo of a shovel that was found under a deck outside
 of Bravo's apartment building in Spyglass, which officials said he used
 to bury Aguilar's body in a remote field.

Prosecutors believe that the 20-year-old defendant strangled his former friend-turned-rival inside his vehicle after giving him Gatorade laced with a mixture of drugs during a shopping trip September 20, 2012.

On Wednesday, the court heard the second part of the testimony of Aguilar's girlfriend, Erika Friman, who detailed her relationship with the two men.

The three of them had been friends in high school. After Friman entered college, she began dating Aguilar but kept it a secret from Bravo, WWGP reported.

‘I lied to him because he was at a 
very sensitive point in his life, I supposed,’ she said. ‘I didn’t want 
to throw him over the edge and say, “By the way, I’m dating a mutual 
friend of ours.”’

When Bravo,
 a student at Santa Fe College, found out about his friends' budding 
romance, police said he became obsessed with the idea of eliminating 
Aguilar so he could be with Friman.

Friman told the court that she arranged a meeting between the two men after Bravo threatened to kill himself.

‘I cared about anyone who claimed they were suicidal,’ she told the court.

As part of her testimony, Friman also read entries from Bravo's journal.

‘No
 one will stop me,’ the suspected killer wrote. ‘I will get out of Miami
 and into Gainesville by January 2013 and I will get her back.’

Prosecutors say on September 21, 2012, Pedro Bravo spent 13 minutes strangling Christian Aguilar in a Wal-Mart parking lot before burying the body.

Aguilar's skeletal remains were discovered in October 2012 - several weeks after his murder - by hunters in forest off State Road 24 near Cedar Key in Levy County.

On Tuesday, Kramer showed a photo of Bravo and Aguilar as high school pals in Miami and surveillance photos of them buying a Kanye West CD at Best Buy in Gainesville, according to Gainsville.com.

But he also showed gruesome pictures of Aguilar's remains to the courtroom, and Bravo didn't react.

Other surveillance pictures showed Bravo buying a shovel, drugs, duct tape, a knife and other items from Lowe's and Wal-Mart that were used in the alleged killing.

The prosecution's case leans on Bravo's journal and sketchbook, in which he detailed his bubbling resentment regarding his and Friman's break up and the fact she had began to date Aguilar.

'His plan is to get her back,' Kramer said of Bravo. 'He's got to reunite with Erika.'

In preparation for the murder, Kramer said, Bravo searched the Internet for information on murder, anesthetics and cutting veins, and then on the fateful day he lured Aguilar to his car and then suffocated him using possibly a belt around his neck in the back seat.

'He cuts off the air to his airway and blood to his brain,' Kramer said. 'He would later (tell someone) it took Christian 13 minutes to die.'

Friman and Bravo were dating at high school in Miami but Friman ended things before leaving to Gainsville to attend Santa Fe College, where Bravo later followed.

Friman reported that Aguilar was missing when he failed to meet her as planned on September 20.
