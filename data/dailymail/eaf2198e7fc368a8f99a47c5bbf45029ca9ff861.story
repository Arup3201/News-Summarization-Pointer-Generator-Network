Skimpily clad young women sway in towering heels, with little more than a ripped t-shirt and shorts to protect them from the October evening.

Overly refreshed young men are helped along the streets by bleary eyed friends, while others are bent double, and wretching in the streets.

These were the scenes in the early hours of this morning in Sheffield as the latest Carnage UK event hit the city.

Dubbed Britain's most debauched student pub crawl, the night certainly lived up to its name. 

Hundreds of students took to the streets of Sheffield last night to join one of Britain's biggest student pub crawls

The Carnage UK event, held this weekend in Sheffield, certainly didn't disappoint the many Freshers who joined the crawl across the city

The night looks to have proven too much for one reveler, as he leans over, apparently overcome with nausea

However, by the usual standards of the event - which promoters claim will give students 'the best night of their lives' - the night in Sheffield appeared somewhat tamer than previous events.

While previous fancy dress themes have included 'Pimps and Hoes' and 'Nympho nurses and dirty doctors', this year's circus theme lent itself to a slightly more Autumn friendly outfit. 

The suspenders, stockings and basques of previous years were replaced in large by jean shorts, trainers and t-shirts.

While it may have descended into a drunken haze for some, this excitable bunch of friends instead end the night with a bite to eat

The night is somewhat tamer than previous events, and even the dress code appears to have been tailored to better tastes, with suspenders and basques swapped for tights, shorts and t-shirts

Amorous couples were still seen 
canoodling in the streets, some sliding to the cold ground for a seat, 
and weary party-goers flocked noisily to kebab and chicken shops to soak
up the booze with a takeaway.

The excitement looked to have proven too much for one young man, as he clutches on to a wall, overcome with nausea.

The
Carnage UK organisers have repeatedly come under fire for promoting 
excessive binge drinking as students are encouraged to go from one bar 
to the next to consume copious amounts of alcohol.

In the past, police have had to draft in extra man power during the event

In the past, the nights have ended in controversy. But this year's event in Sheffield seemed have passed without major incident

Some revelers appear to have opted for water as they chat after the event

In the past, the nights have ended in controversy.

In
2009, 19-year-old student Philip Laing desecrated a poppy wreath in 
Sheffield and was later ordered to carry out 250 hours of community 
service and pay £185 cost after admitting outraging public decency.

Following
a Carnage event held the same year, police said they were looking into 
the possibility of charging the organisers for the cost of the extra 
police needed to be drafted in to man the streets.

Police in Exeter claimed the event cost them thousands of pounds.

In 2010 a court heard how a carnage pub crawl operator punched unconscious a resident who voiced concerns about noise levels at one of their events.

The MailOnline has contacted Carnage UK for comment.
