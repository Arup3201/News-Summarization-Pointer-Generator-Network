Prosecutors say a South Californian woman with a world-record collection of more than 15,000 shoes was beaten with a baseball bat and found dead in her swimming pool.

Justin Smith, the 29-year-old boyfriend of Darlene Flynn, 58, otherwise known as 'The Shoe Lady,' or 'Queen of Sole,' was arrested on suspicion of murder and arraigned Thursday in relation to her death. He didn't enter a plea, the Riverside Press-Enterprise reports.

Authorities say they went to the Guinness World Record holder's home on Monday after a report of a man and a woman yelling.

Shoe-obsessed: Darlene Flynn, 58, from Romoland, California, who was known as 'The Shoe Lady', has been found dead in her pool, and her former boyfriend has been arrested on suspicion of murder

When they arrived, they saw a 
shirtless man running away from the property and found Flynn's body, which had suffered blunt-force injuries, in 
her backyard pool. It was unclear how long she had been dead.

Mr Smith was arrested later that day near a highway.

Friends of the couple say the relationship had been volatile, and neighbor Steven Danford says they had a rocky past.

'I'd hear her yelling. They'd be fighting a little bit, every couple of months or so,' Mr Danford told ABC News station KABC-TV.

'He'd be fighting with her, and he'd take off, and come back a couple hours later. They just did not get along real well â€¦ but he kept coming back.'

The
 Guinness Book of World Records says Flynn had nearly 15,000 
shoe-related items, including shoe-shaped furniture, lamps and jewelry, estimated to be worth $500,000. Small claims court records show Flynn alleged Mr Smith owed her nearly $10,000.

Flynn started her collection following a divorce in 2001. By 
2006 she had 7,765 items and had been inducted into the Guinness Book of
 World Records.

Among the more famous items are a replica of the 
Disney Cinderella glass slipper, Dorothy's red shoes from the Wizard of Oz, an array of Betty Boop shoes and Barbie heels by the bundle.

In 2012, on TLC's My Collection Obsession, Flynn revealed she met Mr Smith at a local bar. 'I was wearing my sexy light up shoes. . . we danced all night long,' she said.

'She's got her shoe toothbrush, shoe 
shower curtain, she even makes me make her a shoe breakfast. I'll bake 
scrambled eggs and bacon and then when I put it onto the plate I'll fold
 it into a shoe and serve it to her.'

Ms Smith also admitted that the couple would 'sometimes argue about her shoes'.

'Sometimes I think she gets too many shoes, but I learned to just deal 
with it,' he said.

Glass display cabinets adorn nearly 
every room in the home, and it took Flynn a staggering two full weeks to remove each item from its display cabinet and set it out.

She admitted in an interview with the North County Times: 'I don't know why it had to be shoes. I just love them and it kind of got out of control.'

She said she was inspired to buy her 
first 28 shoe figurines after visiting a family friend who collected 
them, around the time that she and her husband divorced.

'I didn't have to focus on a husband anymore and I had time to concentrate on the shoes,' she said.

'I love having them around. I look at them everyday and I remember when I bought them and my 
travels around the world.'

Though
 she had spent up to $1,800 on a single miniature shoe, Flynn's most 
treasured item was a boot worn by her late grandmother on her wedding 
day.

The mother-of-one said she could wear 'only' about 100 pairs from her shoe collection, and aspires to one day create a shoe museum.

She almost even became the real-life lady who lived in a shoe, having once placed a $6,000 bid on eBay to purchase a 16ft by 20ft
 building shaped like a shoe. Unfortunately for Flynn, someone else beat her to it.

'I would live in a shoe, if it was big enough to hold my other shoes,' she admitted.
