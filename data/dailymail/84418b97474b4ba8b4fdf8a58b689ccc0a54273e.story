As political grillings go, it was not exactly Jeremy Paxman.

Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg today faced a grilling from TOWIE star Joey Essex, who seemed a little confused about the Liberal Democrats’ name, and what the election was all about.

Mr Clegg had to patiently explain that the party was not called ‘Demo-cats’, after Essex wondered why it had such a ‘weird’ name.’

In tribute to the star's blunder, the party changed the logo on its website from the yellow bird to a yellow cat.

On the second day of the election campaign, Mr Clegg launched the Lib Dem manifesto for mental health.

But amongst the journalists and broadcasters in the audience was the 24-year-old reality TV star, who is said to be making a documentary for ITV 2 on the election.

Essex questioned why every party thinks they are right about everything, what is the point of voting Lib Dem and told Mr Clegg that being Deputy Prime Minister must be ‘sick’.

The unlikely duo appeared to hit it off, and later posed for a selfie.

But the most bizarre exchange came when the unlikely interviewer asked about the party’s name.

‘Why are they called Liberal Democats? It’s a long word innit?’ Essex asked.

Mr Clegg tried to explain the history of the merger between two rival parties in 1988. ‘There used to be a Liberal Party. And then used to be a party called the Social Democrats.

‘This was before my time, they got together and created the Liberal Democrats.’

‘Oh so you teamed up?,’ said Essex. 'I wondered that because it’s a weird word, innit? It’s got cats in it.’

Laughing, Mr Clegg tried to put him right. ‘It’s not “cats”, it’s “crats”.’

The penny finally dropped. ‘Oh it’s “crats”. I thought it was “cats”. Oh wicked.’

The conversation moved on to the merits of power, and just how much Mr Clegg wields. ‘You are basically like, you rule this country right?’

‘I’ve been Deputy Prime Minister for the last five years,’ Mr Clegg replied.

‘That’s sick. I sort of rule Essex. I was going to say, someone else will be Prime Minister next? Are you going to be Prime Minister?'

The Lib Dem leader, currently on around 8 per cent in the polls, had to admit this was unlikely.

‘I would love to be Prime Minister but I’ve got to be open with you Joey, I don’t think I am going to win this election outright.

‘I do think that like last time the debate will be about which mixture of parties in government. If you speak to Ed Miliband and David Cameron they will say they are going to win outright, they won’t do.

‘Everybody knows they are not going to win outright.’

Essex is due to interview Labour’s Ed Miliband and Tory leader David Cameron during the election campaign.

Mr Clegg said that he should challenge them both on the idea that either of them can win outright.

‘When you speak them, they will tell you both that they will win. Everyone knows they are not going to win outright.

‘The question is who do you want making decisions who have got the right values and instincts and feelings about stuff. I think the Liberal Democrats - not “cats” - have shown in the last five years have got good instincts.’

Somewhat stating the obvious, Essex admitted that he does not ‘really know much about all the politics’.

It was only his second day in his job as a roving reporter on the campaign trail and so far ‘at the moment to me everyone just seems to want to win’.

‘Everybody is fighting for the same position. I don’t really get it,’ he said, telling Mr Clegg: ‘You’ve taught me a lot about Liberal Democrats. At least I know the name now.’

Pointing to his all-white outfit, he added: ‘I was meant to be wearing a suit today but they didn’t tell me I was meeting a leader.’

Essex later said he thought was a 'nice bloke, to be fair', adding: 'He was honest, he told me he weren't going to win - I think honesty is the best policy.

'If - not saying I'm going to be Prime Minister - I was going to lose something and genuinely thought I was going to lose, I would be honest and say I was going to lose. I think that was quite a nice thing of him to say. He was a nice guy.'

He added that he was 'excited' about meeting the Labour and Tory leaders: 'David Cameron is the Prime Minister.

'But to be fair, to me, they are all prime ministers. They're all on TV, they're all doing good things, they're all trying to make people happy, so in my eyes they're all nice people really - like, at the moment anyway, until I maybe meet one of them and he's not nice.

'But they're all sweet at the moment.'

Asked if there were any words politicians should use, Essex laughed as he replied: 'They could use reem. No, I'm joking. They could use that, but they won't.'
