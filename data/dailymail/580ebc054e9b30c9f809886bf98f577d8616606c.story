Joshua Alvarez has wanted a pair of Air Jordans for the last two years, but has missed out each time after getting to the store too late.

So when his little brother said he wanted some limited edition kicks for Christmas, he knew he had to do everything it takes.

The pair recently lost their father, and Alvarez wants to do as much as he can for his 14-year-old sibling, even though their family are struggling to cope with the loss.

Dedicated: Joshua Alvarez is camping outside a Houston mall from Wednesday until Sunday in order to buy his little brother the Air Jordan trainers he wants for Christmas

'Right now, I'm stepping up for my mom and him,' Alvarez told ABC 13.

'We don't have much so, I got a good job now so I can buy him the shoes he wants. 

'So that's what I'm doing now. 

'I'm just kind of stepping up for him.' 

In order to do that, Alvarez has set up a little camp site outside Houston's shopping mecca The Galleria.

He has been there since Wednesday morning, even though the shoes don't come out until Sunday.

His brother is hoping for a pair of Air Jordan 11 Retro, which have not been seen since 2001 and are likely to sell out quickly.

Campsite: Alvarez has been surviving off one meal a day and lots of Diet Coke

Stepping up: Alvarez says he wants to ensure his brother's Christmas is special

They are priced at about $120.

Alvarez has asked a friend to help him out and sit with him during the days.

That allows him to be able to go to the bathroom when he needs and go for food.

He told ABC 13 that so far he has only been eating one meal.

He appears to be surviving off Diet Coke.

And of course the thought of his kid brother's face on Christmas morning.
