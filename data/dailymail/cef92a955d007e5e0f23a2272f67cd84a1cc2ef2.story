When most kids sit on Santas' lap, they wish for a new bike or a Barbie doll, but for one young boy, all he wants for Christmas is to have his dad back from heaven.

Issac Zariffa, from Sydney's west, never met his father, Peter, after he died in a horrific car accident seven years ago, just three days after receiving good news about his wife’s pregnancy.

The married couple spent two years trying to have a baby but one morning in 2007, Miriam discovered she was pregnant with their first child.

Issac and mum Miriam were invited to take part in an 'Oprah-like surprise' Australian first Christmas special 

The six-year-old grew up wondering who his father was and the kind of man who served with the army as a medical officer in East Timor before his tragic death.

Appearing on Channel Ten’s The Living Room, the show’s most ardent fans and those in need were invited to be part of the Christmas special and tell Santa what they were hoping for this Christmas.

With 90 minutes to make the wish come true, Santa’s Little Helpers from online retailer OO.com.au furiously packed gifts at the workshop to match each and every one of the audience’s requests.

Little Issac Zariffa told Santa that all he wants for Christmas is his daddy back from heaven

Issac was gifted a digital photo frame, so he could see his dad’s face every day when he wakes up and he also got a go kart and a Lego set

While the jolly fat man couldn’t grant the boy’s wishes, he asked Issac if he had many photographs of his dad

When it was little Issac’s turn, he shared his heartbreaking wish with the big man in a red suit that he wanted his dad back so his mum could be happy again – and it brought everyone to tears.

‘At his age, he’s becoming more aware of the fact he doesn’t have his daddy but I didn’t realise how much he knew it. It hit home and was quite tear-jerking,’ Miriam told the Daily Telegraph.

‘In my head I was thinking “How are they going to do this?”’

During the month of November, OO.com.au took the streets of Sydney surprising and bringing joy to shoppers

While the jolly fat man couldn’t grant the boy’s wishes, he asked Issac if he had many photographs of his dad at home.

‘He explained that we didn’t have very many displayed and Santa said it would be nice if we could,’ Ms Zariffa said.

Issac was gifted a digital photo frame, so he could see his dad’s face every day when he wakes up and he also got a go kart and a Lego set, while his mum was given a vintage bicycle.

The Living Room's Christmas special airs on Friday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten.
