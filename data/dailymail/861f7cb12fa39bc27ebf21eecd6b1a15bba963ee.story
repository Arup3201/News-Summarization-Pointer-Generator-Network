A drug-addled robber terrorized Miami during rush hour this morning after he took a hostage during a botched drug store heist, shot and wounded three police officers and stole a squad car before he was gunned down in the street with an accomplice.

The mayhem began at 3.30am Tuesday when Adrian Montesano tried to rob a Walgreens in Little Havana and the crime went horribly wrong. Police say he took a hostage in an attempt to get what he wanted.

Police released a surveillance camera image showing 27-year-old Montesano with his arm around a female hostage's throat while he points a semiautomatic pistol at her head. She was later released unharmed.

Witnesses said Montesano was driving 
pickup truck for his heating and air conditioning business that was 
emblazoned with his own name.

Horrifying: Police say this surveillance camera image shows Adrian Montesano, 27, after he took a hostage during a botched drug store robbery

A man who arrived at the crime scene and identified himself as Montesano's friend told the Miami Herald that Montesano robbed the pharmacy to support his drug addiction.

He said that Montesano had been an upstanding citizen before he 'fell in with the wrong crowd.'

About 5am, Miami Officer Saul Rodriguez spotted Montesano's truck at a trailer park about two miles from the robbery scene.

When the 13-year police veteran approached the vehicle, Montesano shot him in the stomach.

The fugitive then took the officer's pistol and sped off in his squad car.

WSNV-TV reports that Rodriguez could be heard gasping for breath as he radioed in a description of the man who shot him.

'White male. Red shirt. Gray pants. Officer down.'

That
 set off a frantic manhunt across the city. Half an hour later, the 
squad car was spotted near  the home of a family member of Montesano.

Officers spotted him in his grandmother's blue Volvo, which witnesses later said he had taken from her home.

A police pursuit ensued and Montesano, who was driving with another man, crashed.

As officers approached, Montesano and his accomplice opened fire.

Two officers were wounded in the arm.

Police returned fire and riddled the luxury car with bullets.

One of the suspects died at the scene. The other was mortally wounded and died at the hospital shortly after the gun battle.

Three other officers were hospitalized with minor injuries from the gunfight, including an officer who was hit by flying glass. 

Witnesses say Montesano used his company pickup truck - which has his own name plastered all over it - as a getaway vehicle after the robbery

Police said all six officers, including Officer Rodriguez, were expected to make full recoveries and that their wounds were not life threatening.

Montesano had only one previous run-in with police, when he was arrested in 2007 for trespassing after he drove through a fence into a beach, the Herald reports.

Officers found him trying to use beach signs to get his truck unstuck from the sand. When police approached him, he swore at them and claimed he a member of his family was a police officer.

The mayhem snarled traffic across the city throughout the morning commute as detectives worked to examine the multiple crime scenes and collect evidence.
