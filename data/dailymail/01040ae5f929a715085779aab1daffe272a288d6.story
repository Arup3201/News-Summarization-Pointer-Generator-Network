A touching photograph has revealed the tender moment NFL legend Jim Kelly embraced his wife for a dance on Mother's Day - as he continues his battle against cancer.

The image was captured by the couple's daughter Erin, who shared it on Instagram on Sunday with the caption: 'Daddy just wanted to dance with his bride on Mother's Day.'

The former Buffalo Bills quarterback, who has undergone chemotherapy and radiation since the return of his sinus cancer earlier this year, closed his eyes as he appreciated the moment.

The Hall of Famer's family has regularly shared snaps of his battle, including their celebrations when he returned home from hospital last month.

Kelly, 54, had undergone surgery in Buffalo last June to remove cancerous cells from his upper jaw and he was declared cancer-free.

But earlier this year, he announced the disease had returned and he spent a month in a New York City hospital as he underwent chemotherapy and radiation to target the cancer cells.

Three weeks ago, his daughter shared an image of her father kissing her on the head he returned home after a bout of treatment.

Determined: A few weeks ago the former football player posted a video promising that he 'will be back'

'The journey isn't over,' she wrote. 'But we can finally say DADDY IS HOME!!! Words can't express how thankful we all are... God is good!! I miss you more than words can say daddy and I can't wait to be home with you! I love you SO MUCH!!!!'

Kelly recently attributed his strength to his faith.

'There is no way I’d be here without my faith,' he told MMBQ.com. 'It’s been such a roller coaster.

'So many things. The Super Bowl 
losses, the fabulous career, my son born sick, making the Hall of Fame, 
my son dying, two plates and 10 screws in my back after major surgery, 
one plate and six screws in my neck after another surgery, a double 
hernia, the cancer, surgery on my jaw, the cancer coming back, now what 
I’m facing.'

Kelly also admitted his treatment program faces multiple challenges.

'I just know there's a lot of work to do, to shrink the cancer,' he said. 'I just pray it works.'

Buffalo: Kelly, shown left at 1992's Super Bowl, spent 11 seasons with the Bills before retiring following the 1996 season. He has since made Buffalo his home

Kelly spent 11 seasons with the Bills
 before retiring following the 1996 season. He appeared in four consecutive Super 
Bowls in the 1990s. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame 
in 2002.

He has since made Buffalo 
his home and former teammates Thurman Thomas, Bruce Smith, and Andre 
Reed recently visited the former quarterback.

The cancer battle is not the first tragedy for the family.

Kelly's
 son, Hunter, was born with Krabbe disease, an inherited nervous system 
disorder. Given little more than three years to live, Hunter died at the
 age of 8 in 2005.
