A puppy was left with a  permanently disfigured leg after his cruel owners ignored his injuries and refused to take him to the vet when he was hit by a car, a court heard.

Bronson, a Lurcher, broke his leg after being struck by a vehicle while chasing a cat from his home in Sunderland.

Despite the severity of the injury - owners Anthony Rickatson, 22, and Donna Krager, 32, simply covered the limb in a bandage.

Suffered: Bronson the lurcher was left with a permanently bent leg after his cruel owners ignored his injuries when he was hit by a car, a court heard

Just weeks later Bronson was accidentally dropped as he was being passed over a fence by Krager's children.

He landed on his injured leg which became dislocated at a sickening 45 degree angle.

Rather than take Bronson to the vet, the owners took him to a third party who agreed to take him to the veterinary charity PDSA to get free treatment because they were on benefits.

But this never happened and Bronson was forced to suffer weeks of pain.

RSPCA inspector Helen Scott was later called to an address where the puppy had been staying for five days.

The vet who examined the him said his owners must have realised he was in agony.

Banned: The puppy's owners, Anthony Rickatson and Donna Krager, were disqualified from keeping animals for five years

Judith Curry, prosecuting, said: 'It was apparent that this dog's leg was broken. The leg was bent at the joint and was at a 45 degree angle from its body.

'He is with new owners now and has had a number of operations on his leg.'

Krager and Rickatson admitted causing unnecessary suffering to Bronson between April 9 and July 9, under Section 4 of the Animal Welfare Act at Sunderland Magistrates Court.

Further injury: Just three weeks after being hit by a car the dog was dropped on his broken leg while being passed over a park fence. He dislocated the injured limb at a 45 degree angle

The pair were disqualified from keeping animals for five years and will not be able to appeal the ban for four years. As a result they will lose the family cat. 

When the RSPCA turned up Krager and Rickatson signed the puppy over to the charity.

Gavin Sword, mitigating, said Krager had previously owned a dog for 16 years which was well cared for, but had recently died of cancer.

Mr Sword said the couple had not taken Bronson to the vet as they were waiting for their benefit payments, which were not due for more than a week.

At Sunderland Magistrates Court (above) today, the couple were given six-month community orders with supervision and were told to pay a total of £800 in fines, victim surcharge and costs

He told the court: 'A reasonable person would not have done that. A reasonable person would have said 'this dog needs treatment right away'.'

'They are both very upset and devastated about what has happened. They are gratified to see from the other set of photos that the dog has made a recovery.'

The couple were given six-month community orders with supervision and were told to pay a total of £800 in fines, victim surcharge and costs.
