Paul Davies was jailed for 20 months after he admitted causing grievous bodily harm to the infant

A former soldier who battered a seven-month-old baby so badly that its eyes rolled to the back of its head has been jailed.

Paul Davies, 28, left the infant with life-changing injuries and then falsely claimed to the child's mother that it had suffered a seizure. 

The woman said she had trusted Davies to look after the seven-month-old and when she returned he claimed the baby had 'gone rigid' after having some milk and vomiting.

Prosecuting, Tara Wolfe said: 'He said he started to become panicky. He said he tried to call 999 but his phone wasn't working.'

The baby was 'pale and stiff' when paramedics arrived and rushed it to hospital where scans found bruising around the neck, a brain bleed and bleeding to both retinas.

Experts told the court the brain injuries were most probably due to shaking, and that the full effects of the trauma may not be known for years.

The victim's mother, who is also not being identified, told the court she had 'trusted' Davis with the baby.

Davis, of Clevedon, Somerset, initially denied injuring the tot and implied it could have been forcefully treated by its mother or paramedics.

But he pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm to the infant and was jailed for a 20 months at Bristol Crown Court.

Judge Michael Roach told him: 'We will never know precisely how the baby came by its injuries.

'Whether through temper or loss of control, you caused devastating injuries to that small child.'

Defending, Fiona Elder said: 'It was a one-off incident and a momentary loss of control.'

She said Davis had been using his former partner's phone and the day before the incident she had cancelled her contract and left him unable to call 999.

The court heard Davis was medically discharged from the Army and was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.
