The £27million Olympics opening ceremony will feature smoke stacks, pits and steam power as it showcases Britain's industrial past, new aerial photographs suggest.

Danny Boyle is expected present a grim picture of Britain's satanic mills with a towering factory chimney the centrepiece of a scene showing off the country's coal-powered past.

The organisers have already revealed how they will show off cricket on the village green, dancing happily around the maypoles and singing for joy in the background. But they are expected to show a darker side to our past in the second scene.

Industrial heritage: A new aerial photograph of the Olympic Stadium as preparations for the opening ceremony continue shows a selection of props including cauldrons, chimney stacks and cotton looms

This dramatic image of what the opening ceremony is expected to look like was caught by a cameraman in an airship which passed near the Olympic Stadium in East London.

The river snaking through the centre of London seems to resemble the aerial image of London in the EastEnders credits. But sprouting from the landscape are a selection of iconic images from the industrial past.

There appears to be a coalmine in the image, as well as a water wheel, a cauldron and a cotton loom in the ceremony.

Preview: Among the giant props on display were (Left) a huge 80ft figure
which appears to be holding a wand while (right) a towering chimney stack

A giant figure is positioned in the 
middle of the field which was still covered in tarpaulin when the 
picture was taken. The 80ft structure appears to be holding a staff or 
wand.

In front of the 
figure is the enormous factory chimney while behind it is is a huge 
metal cog, upon which are laid wooden sleepers, perhaps a reference to 
the steam age.

The ceremony, which is expected to be viewed by a global TV audience of more than a billion, will use more than 13,000 props while a million-watt amplifier will provide the sound.

Among
the more unusual items on show are three enormous iron-framed beds, one
of which has a pirate's hat and a hook lying on it which might indicate
the use of the Captain Hook character from JM Barrie's Peter Pan. Among the 10,000 volunteers involved in the performance are a group of NHS nurses.

There will be three final rehearsals for the opening ceremony in the Olympic stadium the week before the Games, featuring up to 60,000 people, including 900 schoolchildren.

The volunteer performers are not being paid but will receive travel and food costs, and officials have sent out letters warning those taking part not to divulge any information about what they are doing.

Boyle, who directed the multi-Oscar-winning film Slumdog Millionaire, said the aim of the ceremony was to create 'a picture of ourselves as a nation' and to ensure it is authentic there will even be giant fake clouds which will pour with rain.

Such is the pressure to get the ceremony perfect that officials have warned that any children unable to make every practice session will be prevented from performing.

The largest harmonically tuned bell in the world, which has been specially forged at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry will ring to mark the start of the ceremony. It is over 6ft tall and weight 23 tons.

Sir Paul McCartney, who was the headline attraction at the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee concert last week, will perform at the end of the ceremony.The former Beatles star has admitted that he will be ‘closing the opening’.
