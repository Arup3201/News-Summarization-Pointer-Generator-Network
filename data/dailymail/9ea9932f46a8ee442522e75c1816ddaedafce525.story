A Tamil man, who suffered years of torture at the hands of the Sri Lankan army, reached his 'tipping' point on Friday by setting fire to himself inside a Melbourne home when he heard his brother may have been murdered back home.

Daily Mail Australia has learned that the 40-year-old, who can not be identified for fear he will be returned back to Sri Lanka, was jailed in his home country in 2007 and beaten because he donated food to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (Tamil Tigers) during the Sri Lankan civil war.

He, along with his brother, were partners in a business which donated food to the Tamil Tigers, an independent militant organisation who were at war with the Sri Lankan government over a bid to create a separatist, independent state. The brother's links with the then terrorist organisation, which the Tamils were classed, landed them in jail.

The Tamil refugee was rescued by his housemates and taken to Dandenong Hospital with only minor burns, after he burned himself on Friday

The man set himself alight at a home in Noble Park, south east of Melbourne

The Tamils where locked in a civil war with the Sri Lankan government over the region to the north east of the country, which they wanted to separate from the rest

The man suffered severe psychological trauma during his time in jail and underwent treatment, but Tamil Refugee Council spokesman Trevor Grant said his mental state deteriorated so badly, that on Friday he set himself on fire when he heard his brother was missing in Sri Lanka.

'This is what tipped him over the edge - discovering his brother was missing,' Mr Grant told Daily Mail Australia. 'He (his brother) was tortured as well, and there is some suspicion that he may have been murdered but I don't know.'

AAP reports the man doused his body in petrol, before lighting himself inside his Noble Park home, south east of Melbourne. It is the third such report of Tamils setting fire to themselves, including an incident in which one man died.

Mr Grant said the man was beaten and tortured while incarcerated, including having his legs broken, before he managed to escape the country where he arrived to Australia by boat in 2012.

He was taken to Christmas Island where he spent seven months in detention before being settled in Victoria. He has been unable to work because of new laws which restricted temporary refugees to undertake employment.

Mr Grant has been in direct contact with the Tamil man who is recovering from minor burns inside the Dandenong Hospital. He said he is in complete fear that he will be returned to Sri Lanka by the Australian Government, and this was what ultimately led him to set fire to himself.

He is alive purely due to the intervention of his housemates, who doused the flames. 'We are very lucky on this occasion that the man's housemates were aware of what he was planning to do otherwise we may have had another death on our hands,' Tamil Refugee Council spokesperson Sri Samy said.

'I have had seven young men tell me in the past few weeks that they are thinking of doing this.' She said they all share the same fear of being deported back to Sri Lanka, and would 'prefer to die here than be sent back to torture, which is what the Australian government is doing to many Tamil asylum seekers.'

The unknown Tamil, in this latest case, has a wife and daughter living back in Sri Lanka. Ms Samy said the previous Labor Government and the current Coalition Government, had sent back more than 1000 Tamil asylum-seekers under an enhanced screening process. 

Mr Grant said he believes there are about 6,000 to 7,000 Tamils living in Australia, and urged the government to reconsider sending them back to Sri Lanka. 'We implore the Immigration Minister to reconsider,' he said.
