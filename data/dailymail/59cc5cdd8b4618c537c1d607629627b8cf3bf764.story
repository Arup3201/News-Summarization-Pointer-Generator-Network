The Daily News, known as New York's hometown newspaper, and for its eye-catching front pages, is potentially up for sale

The New York Daily News could be up for sale, potentially signalling a new phase in the New York tabloid wars.

Mort Zuckerman, the owner and publisher of the New York City tabloid newspaper, sent a memo to staff on Thursday that said he was approached about a potential sale a few weeks ago.

The identity of the potential buyer is so far unknown. 

'Although there were no immediate plans to consider a sale, we thought it would be prudent to explore the possibility and talk to potential buyers and/or investors,' Zuckerman wrote in the memo.

He has hired the financial advisory firm Lazard to help with the process.

Zuckerman, acquired the tabloid in 1993 and is a prominent real-estate investor.

His spokesman Tom Goodman had no comment beyond the memo.

The Daily News, known as New York's hometown newspaper, has the fifth largest circulation in the U.S., just behind the Los Angeles Times. 

Top of any list of potential buyers is News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch, owner of arch-rival tabloid paper The New York Post. 

There has been speculation over the years that Murdoch would be interested in buying the paper.

Combining the two papers could produce a total readership of approximately one million.

Zuckerman said that the 'immense hard work in turning the business around in an extremely challenging period for the industry, has put the Daily News in as strong a position than it has ever been, particularly online.' 

I want to share with you a new development regarding the company.

A few weeks ago, we were approached about our potential interest in selling the Daily News. Although there were no immediate plans to consider a sale, we thought it would be prudent to explore the possibility and talk to potential buyers and/or investors. To help us with the process, I have retained Lazard, a leading financial advisory firm.

I have not come to this decision easily. But I believe the immense hard work in turning the business around in an extremely challenging period for the industry, has put the Daily News in as strong a position than it has ever been, particularly online.

I appreciate that this news is difficult for you to digest. But I want to reassure you that my aim throughout this process will be to do the right thing for the business to ensure the Daily News and its brilliant staff have the best opportunity to achieve all our future ambitions.

The newspaper industry has been suffering for years from declining print circulation and advertising revenue, as readership and ad dollars have shifted online.

While online advertising is growing at many newspapers, this is not always enough to make up for the print losses.

The Daily News recently announced it was closing its bureaus in the outer boroughs of New York to center operations in Manhattan.

Existing editorial staff on the outer borough teams are being redeployed internally but will still focus on covering Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx and Staten Island.

Borough staff had already been downsized in 2013, and savings will largely come from real estate and other operating costs.

'By reassigning our district team, we will be strengthening our opportunities to cover even more areas, particularly online,' managing editor for news Robert Moore told Capital New York.

'The Daily News is still wholeheartedly committed to covering borough news, and that will continue both in the paper and digitally.'

Rumors have circulated for some time that the paper would eventually go digital-only.

The Daily News was founded in 1919 and was the first U.S. daily printed tabloid.

It has had a tumultuous history, having survived crippling strikes in 1982 and 1990; the death of then owner Robert Maxwell when he fell off his yacht at sea in 1991; bankruptcy; and being flooded out of its headquarters by Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

Its circulation has eroded from over 1 million papers a day to approximately 500,000 today.

In the crowded New York media landscape both tabloids still maintain a circulation of just over 500,000 copies on weekdays
