The boxer hailed a hero after he tracked down the social media troll who called him a ‘complete disgrace’ was himself suspended from Twitter over a spat with leading boxing promoter Frank Warren.

Curtis Woodhouse, a former footballer with Sheffield United, Birmingham and Hull, was investigated by Twitter and had his account blocked on Friday, though it was reinstated on Monday night.

Remarkably, Woodhouse has become a troll himself after the effort he put into finding ‘Jimmyyob88’ who attacked him on Twitter after his defeat by Shane Singleton in an English light-welterweight title fight in March 2013.

Woodhouse, upset at being called a ‘laughable joke’, put up a £1,000 reward for information about his troll, whom he located to an address in Sheffield and was about to knock on his door before Jimmyyob88 (James O’Brien) apologised, first on Twitter and later face to face on ITV’s Daybreak programme. 

And Woodhouse was widely praised online, with Lennox Lewis, Labour party grandee John Prescott and Joey Barton all offering messages of support.

Woodhouse, manager of non-League side Goole AFC, admits his football career fell apart because of a drinking problem, including taking to the field against Manchester United at Old Trafford while still drunk.

The Football League are not too impressed with an ‘unhelpful’ FA selecting December 16 — the date of two Capital One Cup quarter-finals — for their media Christmas drinks. The FA said it was a ‘scheduling issue during a busy time’.

Andy Anson, chief executive of England 2018’s doomed World Cup bid, has been conspicuous by his silence since the campaign he led was criticised so strongly by Hans-Joachim Eckert’s widely discredited judgement of Michael Garcia‘s 2018 and 2022 bid corruption report. 

But Anson has been concentrating on his day job running sports retailers Kitbag, who are in the process of being sold. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley is one of many interested in buying. 

But his ‘pile ’em high’ Sports Direct empire doesn’t seem a natural fit with Kitbag, whose corporate partners include the NBA, NFL, McLaren, Real Madrid and Ryder Cup.

The ridiculous UEFA edict that Slovenia had to travel by bus from their Hilton Hotel next door to Wembley before the England game rather than walk compares with the rather more recognisable Brazil team, including Neymar, making the five-minute journey on foot before their friendly against England.

Ed skips Roo’s big day

Manchester United’s Wayne Rooney may have been making his 100th appearance for England, with United legend Sir Bobby Charlton presenting him with a golden cap. But interestingly, Old Trafford executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward chose to spend his day off at Twickenham watching England lose to South Africa.

Meanwhile, centurion Rooney’s choice of three favourite goals in England colours seems to change by the day. At the start of last week, they were his first against Macedonia, his first tournament goal v Switzerland at Euro 2004 and a goal v Croatia in the same tournament. 

But in the Wembley programme, it was the Croatia one, the one against Argentina in a friendly in Geneva and the one against Poland last year.

It begs the question why FA chairman Greg Dyke went to the considerable cost of setting up an England Commission to improve the national team when manager Roy Hodgson says after the Slovenia victory: ‘There’s enough players to choose from. I’m not stuck for choice.’ 

Meanwhile, Hodgson took a dim view that Sky Sports News, granted an interview after asking to talk about his trip to Malmo to receive a special award on the 25th anniversary of his five successive league titles with the Swedish club, never mentioned Malmo until reminded to do so by Hodgson.

Twickenham regulars, whose West Car Park boot parties have been marginalised by an RFU land grab, fear that after the World Cup the whole of the car park will have been commandeered for commercial activity. 

And they’re also unimpressed about having to go to Kempton Park — not for the horse racing but for the World Cup park and ride that is being tested for the Samoa game at Twickenham on Saturday.
