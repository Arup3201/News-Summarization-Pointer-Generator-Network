Passionate Peterborough United chairman Darragh MacAnthony is regarded by many as the kind of guy they want running their football club.

Well here’s some breaking news – he could be coming to your place soon.

In an exclusive interview, MacAnthony has told Sportsmail that if he loses the Peterborough fans, the time will be right to sell up, and he added that he ‘100 per cent’ wants to be back and owning another club in the future.

Worryingly for fans of League One Peterborough, the chairman also expressed disappointment in the interview that sometimes owning Posh now ‘p***** me off.’

‘I try to do things right, ask for patience in advance of doing things right, and then get hammered on the first dodgy spell we go through. I get p***** off when accused of not spending money. Posh have spent more in the last two seasons than every League One and League Two club, and a lot of Championship clubs so it’s a nonsense accusation. Millions have been spent on young talent and facilities.’

And that is money the club has earned through MacAnthony’s policy of bringing talent through the club, and scouring the lower leagues and non-Leagues for future stars. Dwight Gayle is the best example, signed from Dagenham and Redbridge for £500,000 in January 2013, sold to the Premier League for £6million six months later.

I’m a lifelong Peterborough fan – a season ticket holder - and I sometimes despair at my fellow Posh supporters who seem to have lost a grip on the size of the club (small), the size of the crowds (poor) and by contrast the size of the job our energetic chairman is doing (enormous). These are golden times to be a Posh fan, yet two months of poor results and performances have taken some fans into meltdown, as if they think Peterborough United have some sort of divine right to be in the Championship.

Earlier this year Posh won the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy at Wembley, that counts as success. A few months on and the chairman has got fans tweeting him that they are boycotting the club until Darren Ferguson is sacked. No wonder MacAnthony is annoyed.

The fans should be grateful to have this guy running the club.

‘I love the game, I love owning a club. I honestly feel I’ve made a footprint in the game in a good way and as a younger chairman, if allowed, I could make even bigger and better ones. I want to have a club defying all odds, reaching for the stars and making waves, growing on and off the pitch and owning its own stadium, debt free with 70 per cent of the first-team squad home grown, playing good football, week in week out.’

Fans up and down the country will be reading that, eyes lighting up at the prospect of having a chairman with such vision and drive at their club.

After winning their first league game for almost two months on Saturday, MacAnthony told me he felt ‘relief, ecstasy, happiness and satisfaction. More importantly I really enjoyed the game and the way we played.’ This man is passionate about football.

Good news for Posh fans is that MacAnthony insists he wants to leave them in the Championship or higher, and in the hands of a billionaire, but adds: ‘Fans are the ones who will decide when my time is up and if I lose them and their support then it will be time to sell up for sure.’

Dwight Gayle was signed by Peterborough for £500,000 and sold to Palace six months later for £6million 

And as his workload away from football has recently increased, MacAnthony’s outlook and maybe even priorities have changed.

'My time is spread in a tough way which at times make owning a club difficult. I’m 38 and something may have to give way eventually, especially if I feel I’m not wanted or my work is constantly berated by our own fans. 

'I’m outspoken - gobby at times - and a tad arrogant, but I have a love for the game,’ he said. ‘I’m a fan (he’s been a Liverpool fan since the 1988 FA Cup final defeat to Wimbledon bizarrely) and I’m used to watching good football, not hoof ball, not hardman football, but pass and play, quick tempo, football with pace and flair, the way the game should be played. If I can’t have it then I’m not interested.’

MacAnthony has been chairman of Peterborough since 2006

I hope his departure from Peterborough United isn’t imminent, but I also believe the fans of the club need to slap themselves round the face a little bit. I will be gutted if my club lose MacAnthony. He’s the first chairman in Posh’s relatively short history who’s talked an enthusiastic good game, and had the balls to back it up.

If and when it does happen, Posh’s loss will be another club’s significant gain.
