Hundreds of gun owners are exchanging their firearms for gift cards to buy groceries in Los Angeles in a buyback program aiming to get weapons off the streets.

Lines of cars and people stretched around the block in the first hours of the exchange on Wednesday morning to take advantage of a guns-for-groceries exchange program that was moved up in the wake of the Connecticut school shooting.

Police officers filled bins with a variety of rifles and handguns outside the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena and the Van Nuys Masonic Temple.

Firearm exchange: Hundreds of motorists waited inside their cars to drop off their firearms at a buyback program in Los Angeles that offered grocery store gift cards in exchange

Enthusiastic turnout: A police officer watches over a long line of cars waiting to turn in their weapons at the gun buyback held by the Los Angeles Police Department

In the first hours they reported netting nearly 500 fire arms and 31 assault weapons between both LA locations.

'No ID checks, we're not taking down license plates, people drive up, they have a gun in their trunk, we have one of our gun experts take that gun out, make sure it's safe, they walk over, get a gift card, and away they go. It's very quick and painless,' Police Cmdr Andrew Smith told CBS Los Angeles.

Handguns, rifles and shotguns could be exchanged for $100 Ralphs grocery store gift cards. Assault weapons earned a $200 card.

Officials were mindful of both the massacre of students and teachers in Newtown, Connecticut, as well as a gunman's ambush that killed two firefighters in Webster, N.Y. on Christmas Eve.

Well received: A police officer walks away with three rifles received by the program that had already pulled in hundreds of firearms in the first hours

Tragic inspiration: Police officers load bins containing guns onto a truck during the gun buyback whose date was moved up after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School earlier this month

Positive effect: Since the program's creation in 2009, there has been a 39 per cent drop in gang crimes and 22 per cent drop in calls reporting shots being fired

'All of us are still mourning the 
tragedy at Newtown, Connecticut,' said Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. 'So 
many young innocent children were mass-murdered in the way that they 
were, and now the assassination of two firefighters ... just breaks the 
heart of so many of us, particularly in this holiday season.'

The program was originally scheduled for May but in wake of the December 14th shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary, Mr Villaraigosa decided to do it now.

The last buyback program netted about 1,700 guns.

Since the program's creation in 2009, there has been a 39 per cent drop in gang crimes and 22 per cent drop in calls reporting shots being fired according to police.

Process: When drivers pulled up the unloaded weapons would be removed from their trunks by gun inspectors before they were taken away and a gift card presented in exchange

Worth: A police officer inspects one of the guns where automatic weapons would receive a $200 grocery store gift card and shotguns, handguns and rifles $100 gift cards

Argument: A report by the National Academy of Sciences in 2004 argued that exchanges like this one typically collect weapons least likely to be used in criminal activities

Commorah Fisher, a participant in the 
program earlier in the day, was asked what inspired her to stop by with 
her weapons. She had this to say to CBS:

'To
turn in some ammunition, and guns that may be stolen from our house and
you know someone may do something really bad with them. And that's why 
I'm turning them in.'

In 2004 a report by the National Academy of Sciences, however, argued the exchange's positive effect on gun violence.

It found: 'the theory underlying gun buyback programs is badly flawed and the empirical evidence demonstrates the ineffectiveness of these programs'

They argued that the majority of guns received are those least likely to be used in criminal activities.

They consisted of guns that are old, malfunctioning, or those owned by people with express little value in owning a gun.
