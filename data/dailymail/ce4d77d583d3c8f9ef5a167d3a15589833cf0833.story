A 'Star Trek' assistant that can translate any language, answer any question, and never needs to be taken out of your pocket has been hailed as Google's future by one of its leading engineers.

Amit Singhal, Google vice-president and senior search engineer, and the man who wrote the firm's search algorithm, said that the company has been inspired by sci-fi series Star Trek to develop the 'ubiquitous computing' concept, where gadgets woven into users' daily lives seamlessly respond to questions.

'Why should someone stop their conversation because they're missing a tiny piece of information that you need to take that conversation further?' said Mr Singhal.

Google Glass, the firm's augmented reality glasses, is set to firm an integral part of Google's plans for a computer that is always connected, yet never needs to be taken out of a user's pocket.

'You have to pull out your phone, you have to unlock the phone, you have to type -  Already you have lost valuable seconds and the conversation has become unnatural and awkward.

'I would make a bold prediction that in the next three to five years you will have a Star Trek assistant, with a lot more capability than your phone has now.

'We have built baby steps of this already.

'In future, answers to questions could be delivered to users through devices for the living room and kitchen appliances that respond to spoken commands.

'What if I ask a question and the answer pops up, on my Google Glasses or on the TV or maybe even on the family refrigerator?" he said.

'Then we can go on with the conversation.

'It will make the conversation richer.

The iconic TV show predicted a range of technologies which are already being developed, such as universal translation and advanced medical scanners.

It featured replicators, which can make a perfect copy of anything - not unlike the 3D printers that are already available and expected to become commonplace.

Ships in the series often used cloaking devices to shield themselves from prying enemy eyes - a technology which is slowly becoming reality.

The show also predicted the emergence of smartphones - with the famous 'tricorder' being a handheld, internet connected computer.

It also featured human-like robots, which are already being used in some environments, and are expected to become common[place in the coming years.

However, many more of Star Trek's inventions,  including 'warp speed' space travel and teleportation are yet to arrive.

However, earlier this year, Nature reported that photons had been teleported 89 miles, between La Palma and Tenerife in a groundbreaking experiment that could one day lead to the iconic phrase 'Beam me up, Scotty,' being used for real.

Singhal, who describes his job as 'being in charge of the world's 
search', has previously said he has a simple dream - to built the Star Trek 
communicator he saw on his family's black-and-white TV while growing up 
in India.

'The key to this is when you can have a 
Star Trek Googlephone, where you can say, 'Google, tell me how Alfred 
Nobel made his money?,' he told the Evening Standard.

'You can seek any knowledge on demand.

'How much more productive would 
humanity be if we can achieve this?

'Today I feel more excited about my 
dream, it is almost within grasp," says Singhal.

However, Google is not the only firm hoping to develop a personal assistant.

Apple's iPhone assistant Siri can perform many functions of the mobile phone - including sending text messages - simply by responding to the user's voice.

The iPhone and iPad maker also has a patent on a head-mounted display system using a pair of glasses fitted with small screens.

Mr Singhal said that there were still hurdles to overcome, and that computers will need to understand the intricacies of conversational speech.

He gave the example of a discussion of football, with someone asking 'How are they doing?'. While a computer would be baffled, humans understand it refers to the team.

The inspiration for Google Glass? Star Trek's Lt Geordi La Forge. Today the firm said Star Trek is the inspiration behind much of its work.
