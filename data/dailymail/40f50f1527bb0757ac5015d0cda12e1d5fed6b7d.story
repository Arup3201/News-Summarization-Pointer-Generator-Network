Experts have warned that Europe faces a sustained outbreak of dengue fever – the worst in almost 100 years.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said yesterday that the continent is experiencing its first sustained transmission of dengue fever, which is carried by mosquitoes, since the 1920s.

Six Britons have been confirmed as suffering from the disease after contracting it on the holiday island of Madeira.

Infection: More than 1,300 people infected have been with the mosquito-borne disease in the Portuguese island of Madeira

A further 19 cases have been found elsewhere in Europe among travellers returning from the island.

Since the outbreak began in early October, 1,357 cases of dengue fever have been reported in Madeira, including 669 laboratory-confirmed cases and 688 probable cases.

Eighty-nine people have received hospital treatment but there have been no deaths so far.

Dengue, caused by a bite from a mosquito infected with the virus, can cause symptoms from mild flu-like illnesses to more serious problems such as bone pain.

Holiday hell: Madeira is particularly popular at this time of year for out-of-season sunshine

Preventative: Since dengue-carrying mosquitoes are daytime biters, the ECDC said protection should be applied throughout the day

Severe and potentially deadly forms develop in around 5 per cent of patients.

Dengue is a viral 
infection that can cause a range of symptoms, from mild flu-like illness
to more serious illnesses including rashes and bone pain.

Severe and potentially deadly forms develop in around 5 percent of patients.

Dengue usually clears up by itself within around 1-2 weeks.

There
are no specific medications to treat the disease, but symptoms can be 
managed by taking paracetamol, drinking plenty of fluids and resting.

Madeiran health authorities are 
implementing control and prevention measures and a public awareness 
campaign after the outbreak, the first recorded on the island.

‘Given
the dramatic expansion of endemic dengue transmission globally over the
last 20 to 30 years and the high number of visitors to Madeira, the 
outbreak is large and constitutes a significant public health event,’ 
said an ECDC spokesman.

It 
has advised authorities in neighbouring areas, such as the Canary 
Islands, to step up surveillance of mosquito populations to assess the 
risk of dengue fever spreading.

It did not recommend any travel restrictions but advised protection against mosquito bites, including disinfection and control of mosquitoes at ports and airports.

Dr Dipti Patel, joint director of the National Travel Health Network and Centre, said: ‘Anyone who develops a fever or flu-like symptoms within two weeks of returning from a trip to Madeira should seek medical advice.’
