A grandmother is being forced to become a 'health refugee' and move to England to get the cancer treatment she needs to extend her life.

Maureen Fleming, 63, was diagnosed with bowel cancer six years ago and was refused the drug cetuximab in Scotland.

She and her husband Ian are now considering relocating to Newcastle where 
consultants say she may get the life-prolonging treatment on the NHS.

Their plight was raised directly with Alex Salmond during First Minister's Questions at Holyrood.

The couple watched from the public gallery as Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont described them as 'health refugees'.

They agreed to come to Parliament once all avenues were exhausted.

While cetuximab is free in England, cancer patients in Scotland have to pay about £3,000 a month for it.

Cetuximab was approved for use on the NHS by the Scottish Medicines 
Consortium but the 'decision to restrict its use' was made as a result 
of an application by the drugs company, said Mr Salmond.

Mrs Fleming, a retired secretary from Bonhill, West Dunbartonshire, 
later said: 'If you can afford to pay for the treatment, you get it. If 
you can't, you don't. An option for us is to relocate down south or to 
another area where we can get this drug.

'I would just like to know why you can't get it on the NHS when others get it.'

Paying for the treatment privately costs about £10,000, she said. When the money runs out, the couple feel it is 'probable' they will have to move.

They are already searching for suitable rented accommodation.

Mr Fleming, a 65-year-old retired shipyard supervisor, said: 'We feel as
if the NHS is letting us down. I've worked all my life, I've worked 
right up to when I retired last year.

'We've three children with families of their own. They've all got that 
work ethic that's been instilled in them from their mum and I. Maureen 
only stopped working to have kids, then back to work again.

'So we feel as if we've contributed our NHS for 50 years and we can't 
get the drug that Maureen needs. We think it's very unfair that as 
citizens of here we have to move to England.

"We've got families and it would involve a bit of upheaval because we 
do, like most grandparents, nursery runs, picking up the kids, school 
runs, so our children can go to work. There's that aspect too, that we'd
be giving up that to move to England.'

The couple, who have 10 grandchildren, approached Labour MSP Jackie Baillie more than six months ago to raise their concerns.

Mrs Fleming was described by her consultant as an 'ideal candidate' for the treatment.

'To pretend to people that there is a solution to these hugely difficult
questions that are being faced by every health service across the 
world, in terms of efficacy of what drugs can be approved for use, is 
misleading people entirely,' Mr Salmond said.

Asked what Ms Fleming thought of the First Minister's responses, she said: 'Not a lot.'

She continued: 'The drug is there, the treatment is there for anybody 
that needs it. You're not getting it because you're not in this wee box.
If you can pay for it, it's there for you. It seems unfair.'

In the debating chamber, Labour leader Ms Lamont said prescriptions for 
aspirin and paracetemol can be free while cancer treatment can be 
denied.

'Scots with hayfever can get their prescription for free but Scots with 
cancer may have to leave their homeland for treatment to save their 
lives.

'The
Flemings are a proud family. They are struggling to get together the 
£10,000 needed for the first three months' treatment. But they can't 
afford to pay for any more after that, so they are planning to leave 
their home of 27 years and rent a flat in Newcastle because in England 
they can get the drug for free.

'Time
is short, so Maureen Fleming has come to this chamber today to hear 
first-hand what is the First Minister's advice to her and cancer victims
like her.'

A spokesman for the First Minister later criticised her assertion, 
arguing that painkillers are frequently prescribed to long-term 
sufferers of conditions such as heart disease or chronic pain.

Ms Baillie, the Flemings' local MSP, said her party would 'absolutely' find the cash to offer more cancer drugs to patients.
