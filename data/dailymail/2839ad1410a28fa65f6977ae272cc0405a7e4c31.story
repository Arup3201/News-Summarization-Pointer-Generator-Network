Former Cardiff City midfielder Gary Medel required mouth surgery after being elbowed by Ricardo Cruzado and losing two teeth during Chile's 3-0 victory over Peru.

Medel scored for Chile before the clash with Cruzado towards the end of the first half, which earned the Peruvian a red card in a game that also saw QPR loan signing Eduardo Vargas net a brace.

The Inter Milan enforcer was left spitting blood after having one tooth knocked out and another broken - while he also required stitches in his tongue to stem the bleeding.

'One less tooth and another broken in a 'friendly' game,' wrote Medel on Twitter.

'Thank you all for your concern.'

A statement by team doctor Giovanni Carcuro said: 'As soon as the match had finished, (Medel) had an urgent dental operation to resolve his situation.'

Peru had marginally the better of the opening 20 minutes but striker Paolo Guerrero missed a penalty before Vargas put the home side ahead in the 27th.

With Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez in good form, the hosts controlled the rest of the match and Vargas struck again with a fine volley in the 53rd minute.

'We dominated a lot and maybe we need to keep improving in how we finish moves because we might have got a bigger result,' Chile coach Jorge Sampaoli told reporters.

Chile, who impressed at the World Cup and only narrowly lost to hosts Brazil in the last 16, are preparing to hold the Copa America next year. They host another friendly against Bolivia in Coquimbo on Tuesday.

Captain and goalkeeper Claudio Bravo became Chile's most capped player in his 85th international, surpassing 1962 World Cup striker Leonel Sanchez.
