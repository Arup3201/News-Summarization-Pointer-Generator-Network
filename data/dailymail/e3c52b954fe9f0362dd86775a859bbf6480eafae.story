A Rotherham child abuse victim has told how her attacker warned she would be killed if she refused to have an abortion -  at the age of 14.

The woman, now in her 30s, revealed how she then fell pregnant to the same abuser for the second time just six months later and on that occasion was allowed to keep the child.

Her story comes as it was revealed that as many as 100 teenage girls may have had babies after falling pregnant to their abusers.

According to the Sunday Mirror, the victim, known only as Jane, was targeted as a schoolgirl in Rotherham while she was living with her parents.

She described how her attacker, who was in his 20s, was driving around in his car looking for potential victims when he saw her in the street.

After 'chatting her up' and buying her food and clothes, Jane admitted she felt 'flattered' by the attention.

In the weeks that followed he would sneak in through her bedroom window and have sex with her while her parents slept in the next room.

She told the newspaper that she found out she was pregnant while she was at school - but on telling her attacker, he ordered her to get rid of the baby.

'He told me they would do a DNA test and he would be jailed. He said his friends would find me and kill me.' 

Despite her desperate parents informing social services, she claims no action was taken.

'I had the abortion and I was put in care to keep us apart. He would drive up and down outside my home. It was like he was stalking me.'

Just six months later, and living with foster parents, the abuser tracked her down and she fell pregnant again at the age of 15.

The man allowed her to keep the baby provided she became a Muslim and describes having to 'eat what he did. No bacon, and he talked to me about his religion for hours.'

The pair lost contact for two years while her abuser was in jail for attacking another man.

It was only years later that Jane was told by a social worker that she had been abused and learnt that she had not been his only victim.

She told the Sunday Mirror that during her ordeal she was failed twice by police who did not investigate her abuse.

Jane's story comes as it was revealed that as many as 100 teenage girls in Rotherham, pictured, may have had babies after being made pregnant by their abusers.

The newspaper says more than 100 teenagers may have conceived during rapes.

Jane's story comes after an explosive report which revealed child sexual exploitation in the town had an 'absolutely devastating' effect on the estimated 1,400 victims between 1997 and 2013.

Professor Alexis Jay's report also highlighted another tragic element of the scandal for some of the victims who fell pregnant - being separated from the babies born as a result.

It said: 'In a number of cases we read, children and young people had pregnancies, miscarriages and terminations.

The wholesale sexual exploitation of young girls is going on in 'every town and village' in the country, says the author of the Rotherham sex abuse report.

Professor Alexis Jay, the expert who laid bare the gang-rapes of hundreds of children by predators there, has issued a chilling warning that thousands more are at risk.

She says young girls were still being groomed, threatened and raped in 'every town and village' across the country.

The former inspector of Scotland's social workers was speaking after her damning report which sent shock waves throughout Britain.

She revealed at least 1,400 children in Rotherham - some as young as 11 - were raped systematically by gangs of Asian men.

But she warned: 'There is no question that this is still happening and will carry on because there is a demand for sex with children.

'It is happening in every town and village in the country.'

Prof Jay suggested a national legal requirement for local authorities and the police to report child sexual exploitation.

She said: 'It would certainly help to place the scale of the problem across the country because at this time, we simply don't know.'

Hundreds were raped by predatory men after being groomed and showered with gifts of booze and drugs.

Professor Jay said: 'It was not that they didn't care but they were utterly overwhelmed by what was going on and they didn't get the support they needed.

'I have a huge amount of sympathy with the efforts the parents were making but in many instances, these children were distressed.

'There were threats against their families if they didn't let their girls go out and be exploited by these groups of men.'

Last night, Rotherham's Labour MP Sarah Champion said one of the most upsetting aspects of the scandal was that babies born to some victims were taken away and were never seen by their mothers again. 

She said: 'That speaks volumes about the way these children weren't seen as victims at all.'

'Some had children removed under care orders, and suffered further trauma when contact with their child was terminated and alternative family placements found.

'This affected not just the victims themselves, but other siblings who had developed attachments to the baby.

'However, there were other cases where vulnerable and sometimes very young mothers were able, with appropriate long-term support, to recover and successfully care for their children.' 

It comes as it was revealed there were up to 24 lost chances to halt child abuse in Rotherham.

The Sunday Times reports that there were 'at least' 24 child protection investigations in the South Yorkshire town that failed to prevent the abuse.

The newspaper says that the Professor Jay's report reveals the number of inspections of Rotherham child services since 2002. Organisations that conducted the reviews included, among others, the Home Office, a number of charities, Ofsted and the Social Services Inspectorate.

Meanwhile, the Sun has reported that police are preparing to take re-examine 'at least' a thousand complaints of sex abuse in the town.

The newspaper reports that police officers from other forces could be brought in to take a fresh look at cases from as far back as 1997.
