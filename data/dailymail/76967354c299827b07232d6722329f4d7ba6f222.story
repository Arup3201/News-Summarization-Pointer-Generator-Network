One woman is fighting for her life and another has suffered serious injuries after a car careered off the road and hit them while they were taking a seaside stroll.

The driver, a man in his 50s, is believed to have had a 'medical episode' at the wheel and was pronounced dead at the scene.

The two women had been walking along the esplanade in the seaside village of Sandgate, Kent, when a car suddenly left the road and ploughed into them at around 9.40am this morning.
