When research revealed that two thirds of men across the country feel under pressure to make sex last longer, one Harley Street doctor set about finding a solution.

After years of research and development, the first medically-approved climax control programme in the world has been unveiled and aims to help the seven million men in the UK suffering from premature ejaculation.

A licensed, over-the-counter medical device, the Prolong Climax Control Programme includes a £200 vibrator that aims to desensitise the penis as part of a six-week training programme.

Climax: Recent research revealed that two thirds of British men feel under pressure to make sex last longer and now a Harley Street doctor has invented a solution

Users are instructed to stimulate the 
penis with the device to reach the point of near climax, at which point 
they stop.

This step is repeated three times, and the whole process 
carried out three times a week for six weeks.

Men can train alone or 
practice the programme as part of foreplay - it also comes with lubricant to help avoid soreness.

The Prolong Programme was invented by Harley Street doctor Dr. Andy Zamar to provide what he describes as a 'practical, affordable and effective solution for men looking to learn to control their climax, delay time to ejaculation and improve their sexual confidence and sexual satisfaction'.

It was brought to the market jointly by Dr. Zamar and Tessa Fane, a Harley Street psychotherapist, as an alternative to psychosexual therapy, which they say can be time consuming, emotionally demanding and expensive, costing between £600 and £4,000. 

The makers say the benefits of Prolong programme are that it works instantly, has no side effects and offers a permanent solution.

But does it really work?

In a London teaching hospital run clinical trial, 61 per cent of men reported lasting 11 times longer during intercourse after using Prolong.

In Finland, a further trial demonstrated an improvement of 72 per cent in lifelong sufferers of premature ejaculation with no side effects and continued improvement six months later.

Consultant Psychiatrist, Dr Irina Panihhidina, who participated as a co-investigator in one of the clinical trials of the Prolong Programme, said: 'Until the development of this device assisted programme, treatment options available to men have been limited.

'I have seen first hand the results of the real difference it has on men and particularly their self-esteem and confidence. It’s a simple solution to a life-long problem.'

Dr Zamar, the inventor of Prolong, said: 'We know from clinical trials that the programme can help any man who wants to increase the duration of his performance and not only those who feel they suffer from  early or premature ejaculation.

'Premature ejaculation is an issue lots of men experience at one time or another, and avoiding addressing the issue only leads to sufferers feeling further isolated.

'The Prolong Climax Control training programme is a lasting, affordable solution that has been developed, researched and refined to help the seven million men in the UK, who struggle with early or premature ejaculation.'

Claims to treat the problem by 
desensitising the most sensitive parts of the penis just enough to allow
 sufficient control over ejaculation thus delaying climax for a 
reasonable period of time.

To 
do this, it uses a discreet hand held device as part of a six-week 
training programme.

The device is used three times a week in conjunction
 with the start stop technique. Users place the device just under the 
head of the penis then stimulate the penis.

Once they reach the point of
 near-climax, they stop before ejaculating by removing the device from 
the neck of the penis.

This exercise is repeated twice more – with 
completion to ejaculation the third time if desired (as stated, this 
full process is completed three times a week).

The process is the 
opposite of masturbation as it aims to not allow ejaculation.
