Denmark captain Daniel Agger will miss his side's Euro 2016 Group I qualifying clash with Serbia on Friday due to injury.

The centre back, who rejoined Brondby after eight and a half years in England with Liverpool, hobbled out of his club side's league match against Hobro on Sunday suffering from a groin injury.

"The decision was taken jointly by the Danish captain and (coach) Morten Olsen during a telephone conversation in which it was clear that the risk of aggravating the injury was too great," the Danish Football Association said in a statement on Tuesday.

The news will come as a huge blow to Denmark as they look to tighten their grip on the group in their final qualifier of the calendar year.

Despite losing 1-0 at home in their last game to Portugal, Denmark are level at the top of the five-team group on four points with Albania, who have played a game fewer.

After facing Serbia on Friday, Morten Olsen's side travel to Romania to play a friendly on Tuesday.
