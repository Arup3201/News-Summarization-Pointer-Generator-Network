Bird-like plumage have originally evolved in dinosaurs for courtship displays rather than flight, new findings suggest.

The evidence comes from the first feathered dinosaurs to be discovered in North America.

Researchers in Canada found evidence of feathers in a juvenile and two adult fossils of ornithomimus, a species within the ornithomimid group.

Researchers from the Royal Tyrrell 
Museum of Palaeontology, and the University of Calgary made the 
discovery in 75million-year-old rocks in the badlands of southern 
Alberta.

Ornithomimids were previously thought 
to have been hairless, fast-running birds, and were depicted as such in 
the Hollywood dinosaur blockbuster Jurassic Park.

'The discovery, the first to establish
 the existence of feathers in ornithomimids, suggests that all 
ostrich-like dinosaurs had feathers,' according to a statement from the 
Alberta museum.

Tyrannosaurus Rex used its fiercely strong jaw and neck muscles to literally rip the head off Triceratops after killing the huge armoured creatures, a new theory claims.

Research into Triceratops fossils from the U.S. shows that the Jurassic apex predator first slew its prey, then wrenched off its head in order to get to nutrient-rich neck meat hidden by body armour.

Tyrannosaurus was well known to feed on the Triceratops but until now few have questioned how it got around the herbivore's tough neck frill.

The study presented last week as the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology's annual meeting, and reported in Nature, looked for an answer by examining bite-scarred Triceratops bones.

The museum said the specimens revealed
 that the dinosaurs had a base of down-like feathers throughout their 
lifetime while older ones developed feathers on their arms, 
approximating wings.

But the dinosaurs would have been too 
large to fly, so the plumage might have been employed to attract a mate 
or in the protection of eggs during hatching.

The findings by paleontologists 
Francois Therrien, curator at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, and Darla 
Zelenitsky, assistant professor at the University of Calgary, will be 
published on Friday in Science, a leading journal.

'This pattern differs from that seen 
in birds, where the wings generally develop very young, soon after 
hatching,' said Dr Zelenitsky, lead researcher on the study.

Dr Therrien added: 'The fact that 
wing-like forelimbs developed in more mature individuals suggests they 
were used only later in life, perhaps associated with reproductive 
behaviours like display or egg-brooding.'

The fossils were discovered in 
sandstone and were the first feathered dinosaur specimens found in North
 America, according to the museum statement.

Until now feathered dinosaur skeletons have been found almost exclusively in fine-grained rocks in China and Germany.

'It was previously thought that 
feathered dinosaurs could only fossilise in muddy sediment deposited in 
quiet waters, such as at the bottom of lakes and lagoons,' said Dr 
Therrien.

'But the discovery of these 
ornithomimids in sandstone shows that feathered dinosaurs can also be 
preserved in rocks deposited by ancient flowing rivers.'

Sandstone is the type of rock that 
most commonly preserves dinosaur bones, making it likely that more 
feathered dinosaurs will be found around the world, said the scientists.
