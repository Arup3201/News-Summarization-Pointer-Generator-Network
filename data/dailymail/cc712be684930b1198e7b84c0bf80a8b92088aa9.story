Boost: Prime Minister has taken to drinking a fruit smoothie called a Brain Boost when he is relaxing at the weekend

For David Cameron, the strain of leadership can take its toll at times.

And so the Prime Minister has taken to drinking a fruit smoothie called a Brain Boost when he is relaxing at the weekend.

The drink contains beetroot juice, which is said to help improve circulation to the brain and memory.

Mr Cameron has the drink when he visits the Portobello Fresh Juice Bar near his family home in Notting Hill, West London, with his wife Samantha and their children.

Cafe staff say he believes the pint of smoothie helps him keep concentration and focus after a busy week of meetings.

One worker said: ‘The Prime Minister and his family have been visiting for years and they were all in here again just recently. Sometimes they come here on foot but usually it’s by a chauffeured car.‘Mr Cameron is obviously a creature of habit and always orders  the same thing – a massive fruit smoothie called Brain Boost.

‘The Brain Boost doesn’t come cheap at £5.50 but it does contain plenty of freshly squeezed apples, beetroot, carrots and ginger.

‘It is packed full with vitamins and ironand is said to boost circulation to the brain, and the PM swears by it. He has told me that it actually helps his concentration and keeps him focused, especially after a hard day’s graft at Number 10 or in Parliament.

‘Mr Cameron says he loves coming in here because he can just chill out and spend quality time with his family and be just like any other bloke.

‘Well, almost every other bloke – except that he always comes in with a small team of bodyguards who sit at the other tables in order to keep a close eye on him while he is chilling out.’

Mrs Cameron, meanwhile, is said to prefer a detox drink called  the Body Clean, which contains apples, carrots, cucumbers and oranges.

But their visits are not always entirely healthy, with Mr Cameron partial to a slice of the cafe’s carrot cake.

A waitress said: ‘Mr Cameron adores the carrot cake and has joked with the staff that he feels guilty eating it as he wants to keep in trim. The staff always have to reassure him that it’s made with low-fat Philadelphia cheese and so it isn’t that high in calories.’

When it comes to settling up, the staff said either Mr Cameron or his police protection officers pay the bill.

They added: ‘Does the PM tip big? You’ve got to be joking, let’s just say that the staff couldn’t retire any time soon on what the PM and Samantha leave behind!’

A Downing Street spokesman declined to comment.

They are currently the world’s most popular boy band. And now One Direction can add David Cameron to their growing list of fans.

The Prime Minister revealed he has filmed a cameo role in the group’s Comic Relief music video.He tweeted a picture of the group posing outside 10 Downing  Street, saying: ‘Enjoyed my  cameo in @onedirection’s vid for  @comicrelief charity single. Glad to help with the filming location!’

Formed on the X Factor in 2010, band members Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Harry Styles and Liam Payne are all aged between 19 and 21.

Dressed in hoodies, the group looked a bit more casual than Mr Cameron, 46, who was wearing a smart suit and tie.

The single, which is available for pre-order on iTunes, is a medley of Blondie’s One Way or Another and the Undertones’ Teenage Kicks.

It is not the first time a Prime Minister has got involved in fundraising for Comic Relief.

Last year Mr Cameron was served a meal by Miranda Hart, Ruby  Wax and Claudia Winkleman in a Masterchef segment. 

He also took part in a Sport Relief run with his wife and their two eldest children.

And in 2007, Tony Blair starred in a short sketch with comedienne Catherine Tate, saying her catchphrase: ‘Am I bovvered?’
