One in ten adults has never tried vegetables such as leek, celery and kale, according to researchers. Some have even managed to avoid tasting the Christmas dinner staple Brussels sprouts.

And it’s not just greens that are getting pushed to the side of our plates.

The study also found one in five has never tasted sardines or scampi, while one in ten has never had tuna, salmon or goat’s cheese.

Given a miss: Some adults have managed to avoid Christmas dinner staple Brussels sprouts. Researchers said the omission of nutritious foods in the average diet is leading to deficiencies of Omega 3

The study of 2,000 people, commissioned by supplement producer Seven Seas, found a quarter of people have avoided eating Omega 3-rich mackerel.

One fifth of adults refuse to try olives and staggeringly 10 per cent of people had never eaten broccoli as a child.

Researchers said the omission of nutritious foods in the average diet is leading to serious deficiencies of Omega 3, a vital fatty acid which helps boost the immune system.

A Seven Seas spokesman said: 'It's surprising to see that many staple foods are regularly avoided or haven't been tried.

'No more broccoli': Former President George H. W. Bush famously said he hated the healthy vegetable

‘It’s hard to keep track and manage our diets day to day to ensure we’re setting ourselves up well, but there is clearly a worrying trend of people avoiding many of the foods that can be of great benefit to health and well-being.

‘The average Western diet does not provide the levels of Omega 3 recommended for health because many people do not eat enough oily fish on a regular basis.’

The study also found six in ten Britons described themselves as a fussy eater, and many said their avoidance of certain foods led to difficulty when eating out.

A quarter have never eaten avocado 
and one in seven did not try garlic until they were an adult, with 
apricots, blueberries, prunes and aubergines all omitted from many a 
British diet.

Results also showed a fifth of Brits have never tried asparagus and even fewer had tried figs or prunes.

And the habit is being passed on to the next generation.

More than one  third of parents were worried limited diets were causing themselves and their child to miss out on essential nutrients.

Not liking a food as a child or even associating it with school dinners was enough to put one in ten adults off it for life. 

The most commonly refused foods also included baked beans and black pudding.

The
 Government advises that a healthy diet should include at least two 
portions of fish a week, one of them oily for a boost of Omega 3.

But the Seven Seas report revealed confusion over the recommendations, with a quarter of Britons having no idea what Omega 3 is.

Biochemist Professor Gordon Bell, who worked with Seven Seas on the campaign, said: ‘Samples analysed in our laboratory show that people in the UK have an average of about 25 per cent Omega 3 in their Omega 3 blood count.

'A count of about 40 per cent would be considered as a healthy level.’
