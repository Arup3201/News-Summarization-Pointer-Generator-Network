Many of us regret certain intimate encounters and some are infinitely more glorifying than others, but a squirrel might have some regrets of his own after he mounted a GoPro camera.

The unlikely love match occurred as the camera filmed the lustful squirrel eating seeds and nuts.

The video begins with the squirrel gingerly making his way up to the food which is laid out invitingly on some stones in front of the  camera.

As the squirrel begins eating he glances into the camera and he appears to be far more curious about the device.

However, what happens next is both surprising and amusing. The frisky squirrel turns his back to the camera and moments later he runs behind it.

The rustling of the squirrel can then be heard as he gets up close and personal with the GoPro camera which shakes violently during the intimate encounter.
