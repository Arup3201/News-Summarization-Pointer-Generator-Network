A crowd of 300 angry protestors forced three buses carrying 140 undocumented migrant children and their parents to turn around in Murrieta, California, on Tuesday after they blocked the road.

The dramatic confrontation between the flag waving protestors and the Homeland Security buses came one day after Mayor Alan Long urged residents to resist the federal government's plan to transfer the Central American migrants to California to ease overcrowding of facilities along the Texas-Mexico border.

Holding up banners that said 'Return to Sender' and suggesting the children should be sent to the White House instead, the irate protestors succeeded when the buses turned around and headed to a customs and border facility in San Diego - within sight of Mexico.

The illegal immigrants had been flown from Texas to California on Tuesday and arrived at 2pm to face many Murrieta residents furiously protesting the processing of the migrants to the Riverside County city US Customs and Border Protection facility.

It was the first flight planned for California under the federal government's effort to ease the crunch in the Rio Grande Valley and deal with the flood of Central American children and families fleeing to the United States.

Many of the immigrants were detained while escaping violence and extortion from gangs in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.

The government is also planning to fly migrants to Texas cities and another site in California, and has already taken some migrants to Arizona.

More than 52,000 unaccompanied children have been detained after crossing the Texas-Mexico border since October in what President Barack Obama has called a humanitarian crisis. 

As the caravan neared its destination, a group of 150 protesters waiving American flags and shouting 'Go home - we don't want you here,' filled a street leading to the access road for the Border Patrol station, blocking the buses from reaching the facility.

The demonstrators disregarded orders shouted by local police to disperse, but officers did not attempt to intervene physically to break up the demonstration.

After about 25 minutes, the buses backed up, turned around and left. A board member of the union representing border patrol agents, Chris Harris, said the buses would likely be rerouted to one of six other Border Patrol stations in the San Diego sector.

Lois Haley, a spokesman for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, or ICE, declined to say where the buses were headed. 'For the security of everybody ... we're just not saying anything about any contingency plans now.'

Many of the migrants are under the impression that they will receive leniency from US authorities.

Another flight was expected to take 140 migrants to a facility in El Centro, California, on Wednesday, said Lombardo Amaya, president of the El Centro chapter of the Border Patrol union.

The Border Patrol would not confirm that arrival date.

Mayor Alan Long has warned his citizens to expect busloads of people every 72 hours for the next several weeks, while Mayor Pro-Tem Harry Ramos has warned that Tuesday's standoff could be repeated in the coming days.

‘I believe that there will be protests every time there are buses on track,’ he told a local radio station.

The detainees are primarily children and were supposed to be placed under the supervision of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials before being reunited with family through the United States.

However, Long said that by sending the migrants to Murrieta the federal government is not enforcing immigration laws.

'Murrieta expects our government to enforce our laws, including the deportation of illegal immigrants caught crossing our borders, not disperse them into local communities,' said Long.

Protester Roger Cotton, 49, drove up from San Diego to wave a flag outside of the Murrieta Border Patrol Station.

'I wanted to say that I as an American citizen do not approve of this human disaster that the government has created,' Cotton said to the LA Times.

'Who’s going to pay for them?' he asked. 'What kind of criminality will happen?'

'The Democrats are making it easy for them to come here so they can produce more Democratic voters.'

Police were on standby, but the protest passed without incident, bar the u-turn performed by the buses.

Long urged residents in the suburb of 107,000 people some 60 miles north of San Diego to call their elected officials and voice opposition to the plan.

'We want to make sure everyone is doing what they say they're going to do,' Long told reporters.

U.S. authorities announced last week that Central American migrants would be flown from the Rio Grande Valley to Texas cities and Southern California. The plan is intended to help relieve a crunch caused when thousands of people arrived at the border fleeing violence and extortion from gangs in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.
