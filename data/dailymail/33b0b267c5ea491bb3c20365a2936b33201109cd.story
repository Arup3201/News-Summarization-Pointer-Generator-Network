The decision by a judge  to throw out all five charges against Shrien Dewani will raise serious questions about the South African authorities' long and expensive pursuit of the bisexual businessman.

Pre-trial briefings suggested prosecutors considered their case against Dewani to be 'water tight', 'a fact' and 'powerful'.

Within days of the trial opening, however, a number of South Africa's leading legal practitioners and academics lined up to express shock at the poor quality of some of the state's witnesses. 

In an interview with MailOnline, William Booth, head of South Africa's Law Society, predicted that Dewani's legal team would apply to have his case dismissed after only a fraction of the 16 prosecution witnesses had given their testimonies.

In addition to poorly-prepared witnesses, the prosecution's threadbare case was hampered further by a string of successful applications by the defence to exclude significant planks of the state's case – leaving little or no compelling evidence to link Dewani to the honeymoon murder of his wife.

Here, MailOnline looks at the main reasons why the case collapsed.  

Fallen pillar: Taxi driver Zola Tongo (above) was sentenced to 18 years for his part in arranging the honeymoon murder. Tongo was the only witness who claims to have had any direct contact from Dewani about his desire to have his wife murdered, but his story did not stand up well to days of cross-examination

A POOR 'STAR' WITNESS

Taxi driver Zola Tongo was the only witness who claimed to have had any direct contact from Dewani about his desire to have his wife murdered. 

The prosecution's main claim - that there was a plot to kidnap and kill Anni during a fake carjacking - could only be established 'beyond reasonable doubt' by Tongo.

In his argument to have the case against his client dismissed, Francois van Zyl told the Western Cape High Court: 'Tongo is the pillar on which this case rests. If that pillar falls then the whole case collapses.'

Tongo turned out to be weak on the witness stand  - his story did not stand up to days of cross-examination.

He was described by the judge today as 'inconsistent', his evidence dismissed in a three-hour judgment today as 'making no sense', with 'poor' explanations to back them up.

Another witness, convict Mziwamadoda Qwabe, also failed to impress when he struggled to tell the difference between his right and left.

The fact that Tongo benefited from a reduced sentence in return for giving evidence against Dewani was, the defence team suggested, even more reason to treat his testimony with caution.

However, even though some key elements of his story were borne out by Monde Mbolombo and Mziwamadoda Qwabe – they too had holes punched in their testimonies by Mr van Zyl and Pieter Botha, for the defence.

The prosecution had lined up a number of witnesses to testify to Dewani's homosexuality, including Leopold Leisser (right), known as the German Master, but when Dewani openly admitted that he was bisexual at the start of the trial, it paved the way for his defence to call for the evidence to be deemed irrelevant

DEWANI'S SEXUALITY RULED OUT AS A MOTIVE

The prosecution were not obliged to offer a motive for Dewani wanting his wife to be killed but they identified his clandestine relationship with men, including a male German prostitute, visits to gay clubs and online chat rooms as a possible reason for him to want to be free of his new marriage. He had kept these visits secret from Anni.

The prosecution had lined up a number of witnesses to testify to Dewani's homosexuality, including Leopold Leisser, known as the German Master, and a detective from Scotland Yard who retrieved a bundle of sexually-explicit e-mails between Dewani and an older man.

However, on day one of his trial, Dewani informed the court – via a written explanation of his not guilty pleas – that he was a bisexual who had enjoyed relationships with both women and men.

This was to be the prosecution trump card yet the revelation, less than 200 words in to a 37-page disclosure rendered the prosecution's intended probing into Dewani's sexuality 'irrelevant'.

It meant Mr Leisser's appearance in court, when it came, was considerably shorter than the usual length of a booking to which he had become accustomed in his professional life.

This also paved the way for Dewani's defence team to call for their client's sexuality to be deemed irrelevant to his murder trial - and it duly was.

Prosecutor Adrian Mopp attempted to argue that since Dewani had consistently described himself as a gay man seeking other gay partners on 'hook-up' websites such as Gaydar and Recon, the court should hear more about his conflicted feelings towards his new bride.

Judge Jeanette Traverso disagreed and ruled that the e-mails were inadmissible as was the vast majority of what Leopold Leisser was prepared to say.

The fact that Dewani had told the Birmingham-based escort – who specialises in fetishism and role play - that he needed 'to find a way out' of his engagement to Anni and other conversations they'd shared, was not allowed to be shared with the court.

CCTV footage (above) of the newlyweds, captured by cameras at the Cape Grace hotel, was presented by both defence and prosecution as an insight into their relationship, making it inconclusive.

Film of the honeymooners – in the 24 hours before Anni's death – could be interpreted as showing them miserable and unhappy as well as playful and loving.

AN 'ALIBI' FOR 'SECRET' MEETINGS AND AN IMPROBABLE PLOT 

 Until the start of the trial, the prosecution were confident that CCTV film and phone records which showed how Dewani and Tongo met, messaged and spoke in the hours before and after Mrs Dewani's murder was proof of a conspiracy between them. 

Certainly, security footage of two private rendezvous between Tongo and Dewani in the wake of Anni's murder provided some of the most dramatic evidence of the trial.

The first was recorded on the morning following the carjacking of Tongo's car as they waited for news of Mrs Dewani, who had last been seen being driven away by two gunmen. 

The second was a meeting in which Dewani was seen waiting for Tongo on the day he returned to the UK, in his hand a bag containing money which he admitted giving to the driver.

However, Dewani's lengthy plea statement to the court provided an apparently plausible explanation for the frequent contact between the two men. 

According to Dewani, Tongo had agreed to organise a surprise helicopter trip for his new bride – a plan that necessitated private meetings and phone contact in the hours before the carjacking that claimed Mrs Dewani's life. 

A large bundle of cash that Dewani had put in his wife's bag was the deposit for the honeymoon treat. It was not, as detectives suspected, a payment for his wife's killers. 

Dewani's account of how he was freed from the taxi (above) before his wife was shot dead differed over time

SHODDY INVESTIGATION

Between the time Shrien Dewani reported his wife missing in Zola Tongo's car, with two gunmen at the wheel, until her body was discovered, the case was handled by a string of low-ranked police officers.

Once her body had been found in the back of Tongo's abandoned VW Sharan, the case was handed over to the Hawks – South Africa's elite detective unit. 

Prior to the Hawks stepping in, the investigation was marked by lost notebooks, incomplete witness statements and an inadequate ballistics investigation which had to be re-visited even after the trial got under way.

Judge Jeanette Traverso repeatedly reminded prosecutor Adrian Mopp that he had had four years to get his case in order, before scolding him for 'scurrying around' finalising evidence and identifying new witnesses weeks into the hearing.

New ballistics tests, ordered by the defence, also appeared to cast doubt on whether Xolile Mngeni had been accurately identified as the assassin who fired the fatal shot. 

Mngeni died last month of a brain tumour.

It was another defence initiative that exposed the true extent of Monde Mbolombo's role in Anni's fatal shooting.

Previously identified only as a 'link man' between Tongo and the two assassins he hired to fake a carjacking and kill the honeymooning bride, Mbolombo played a far bigger role on the night of the murder. 

Once the two gunmen had missed the first rendezvous with Tongo's car on a corner of Gugulethu, Mbolombo stepped in to 'project manage' the second attempt, stepping in to coordinate the killers on the ground. 

It was only when Dewani paid for new sound tests to be carried out on CCTV footage of Mbolombo on the phone at the hotel reception where he worked, that the former porter's true role was revealed.

Although he received immunity from prosecution for giving evidence against Mngeni and Dewani, Judge Traverso warned him that it may not be extended.
