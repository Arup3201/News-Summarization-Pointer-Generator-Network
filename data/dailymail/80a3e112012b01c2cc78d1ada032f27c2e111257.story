Greetings from NYC! I'm based in the Big Apple for the next few weeks as we film Made In Chelsea in America. I'm having the best time - loving the shopping and socialising. And hard at work, of course!

Being over here has given me the opportunity to check out American make-up habits, and I have to tell you, these US girls really know their grooming.

While we Brits favour a slightly slap-dash approach to beauty, our American sisters look sleek and glossy every single day.

So I've decided to up my game. No more sleeping in my make-up, no more spilled powder or lipgloss leaking at the bottom of my handbag. It's time for a new, efficient regime, starting with my make-up tools.

It's crazy that, while I'll often spend big on fabulous cosmetics, I've been using the same moth-eaten make-up brushes for years.

Well, not any more. Investing in good quality applicators will make a world of difference to your make-up - allowing you to achieve a more professional-looking (and beautiful) finish.

It's a no-brainer, really. After all, an artist wouldn't paint a masterpiece with his fingers - so why paint your face with anything but the finest tools?

Binky's Best Beauty Brushes

Real Techniques Core Collection

This handy kit contains a pointed foundation brush, tiny precision brush for eyes and lips, contouring brush and fluffy buffing brush, encased in a handy portable case.

The quality of these brushes are incredible for the price - my favourite has to be the buffing brush, which I use to apply liquid foundation when I'm looking for a medium-to-full coverage finish. It blends product out seamlessly for a flawless, HD-perfect base. 

Michael Kors Bronzing Powder Brush

This is my new must-have, as it allows for the expert application of my fave product - bronzer (as well as regular face powder). It has a soft, wide head, perfect for buffing and blending powder make-up.

It's also soft enough to use anywhere on your body, which means you can use it to contour make-up on the delicate skin of your décolletage and neck.

bareMinerals Double Ended Precision Eye Brush

This is a fabulous all-in-one tool for eyes. Use the ultra-soft contour brush to sweep and blend eyeshadow across your lids without tugging at the delicate skin around your eyes.

Then flip it over and, with the stiffer, pointed liner brush (used either wet or dry), create the perfect precision eyeliner flick.

Dior Backstage Large Eyeshadow Brush

Regular readers will know I'm a big fan of strong brows and smoky eyes, which means a brush like this one absolutely essential. The soft, angled head allows for precision application of eyeshadow and brow make-up, allowing you to place colour exactly where you want it. The result? Perfectly defined eyes.

Binky is loving Bioderma's matifying fluid - she says it works well as a sun protector and primer

EcoTools Skin Perfecting Brush

This is a clever little brush and the secret is its angled edge. The shape allows you to get make-up right into hard-to-manage areas, such as the corners of your nose and eyes.

Not only that, but the cut of this brush is specially designed for use with BB and CC creams, allowing for a super-smooth application and, since you're not using your fingers, ensuring less oil is transferred from your hands to your face. Clever!

bareMinerals Maximum Coverage Face Brush

This full, firm foundation brush has bristles made from Taklon - a clever substance which picks up and dispenses more product than a regular hair brush.

Use it to apply a really professional-looking base - you'll be so amazed at how flawless your skin looks, you'll never go back to finger painting!

bareMinerals Flawless Application Face Brush

A great all-rounder, this brush works a dream with foundation, mineral powders, blushers and face powders. Chunky enough to pick up plenty of product and soft enough to blend beautifully, it's a multi-tasking treat!

Real Techniques Your Finish/Perfected Blush Brush

Blusher and bronzer can be two of the hardest products to apply. Get it wrong, and you end up with clown-like blotches of pink on your cheeks or muddy streaks of bronze, and yet beautifully applied cheek colour really lifts your complexion, adding a warm, healthy glow. That's why this brush is such a find.

The hand-cut, domed head gives you complete control, allowing you to deposit colour exactly where you need it, while its fluffy Taklon bristles ensure make-up is dispersed gently, without caking.

I couldn't be happier with my new brushes, thanks to which I'm starting to feel as glamorously groomed as my NY buddies. You'll find a great selection of tools at my favourite online beauty store Escentual.com.

I also have to give a shout out to one of my recent favourite products - the Bioderma Photoderm AKN Mattifying Fluid.

With the temperatures rising here in NYC, I've been using this as both a facial sun protector and a primer. As well as protecting my skin from UVA and UVB rays, this SPF30 cream also regulates sebum production - keeping spots and blemishes at bay - and mattifies the skin.

Finally, Skinbreeze Blemish Fix is another skincare saviour that's been helping me keep my complexion clear while in NYC.

Whenever I feel a pesky spot rearing its ugly head, I dab a touch of this serum onto the area both morning and night. It leaves my skin looking clear and feeling fresh within just a few days.

Stay beautiful,

Love Binky xxx
