Qatar has become the biggest shareholder in British Airways in a deal which has raised fears over security.

The gas-rich Middle Eastern state has bought a £1.15billion slice of IAG, which owns BA and Iberia.

Critics pointed out that Qatar stands accused of having links with terrorist organisations including Hamas, Islamic State and Al Qaeda. They say that allowing it part-ownership of Britain’s national carrier raises clear security issues.

Qatar has become the biggest shareholder in British Airways after buying a £1.15billion slice of IAG, which owns BA and Iberia

The nearly 10 per cent stake has been bought by Qatar Airways, which is owned by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, and the deal makes it the single biggest shareholder of the airline group.

It is claimed the deal will strengthen BA’s transatlantic networks, while IAG wants to bolster its ties with Middle East and Asian airline networks.

BA is only the latest of Qatar’s controversial British acquisitions – others include Harrods and the Shard skyscraper – and the move has reignited concerns about its growing role in UK companies.

Qatar already owns a 20 per cent stake in Heathrow and Qatar Airways’ boss Akbar Al-Baker sits on the airport’s board.

IAG chief executive Willie Walsh, welcomed Qatar as a 'long-term supportive shareholder'

Willie Walsh, IAG chief executive, welcomed Qatar as a ‘long-term supportive shareholder’ and said it plans to ‘work more closely together and further IAG’s ambitions as the leading global airline group’.

But Baroness Cox, a cross-bench peer and founder of the charity Humanitarian Aid Relief Trust, said: ‘Companies that accept investment or agree to work with Qatar should consider very carefully its human rights record and whether they are supporting a regime that is incompatible with British values.’

 Political campaigner Alexander Craig, a former leader of the Christian Peoples Alliance, said: ‘Airlines in general and BA in particular are hugely strategic assets and important targets for terrorists.

‘What are we doing selling our national airline to a country that is widely accused of funding terrorism and that clearly does not share either our values or interests?’

Qatar insists it does not support terrorist organisations and has acted to block the funding of such groups by its citizens. It is also a member of the United States-led military coalition against IS.
