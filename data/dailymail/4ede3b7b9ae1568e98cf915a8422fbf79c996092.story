They say money can't you class, but it can certainly get you a blinging accessory, at least at Dubai's Burj Al Arab hotel.

The iconic sail-shaped hotel, built on its own man-made island, is offering guess the chance to purchase their very own 24 carat gold tattoo.

The iconic sail-shaped hotel - a favourite haunt of Wayne and Colleen Rooney - has teamed up with French jewellery brand Marbella Paris to offer its guests the opportunity to adorn their perma-tanned bodies with an exclusive range of self-adhesive body art.

All that glisters: French jewellery brand Marbella Paris has teamed up with the Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai to offer guests the chance to adorn their perma-tanned bodies in 24 carat re-usable tattoos 

According to the jeweller, each dazzling golden tattoo is re-usable, and is ‘handmade and composed out of the finest materials.'

'We are revolutionising the way you wear jewellery,' says the company, which is soon to open its first salon in the United Arab Emirates. 

'Our mission is to help you feel unique and enhance inner beauty of the women on their way of freedom.'

And for guests who really want to stand out from the crowd, Marbella Paris will also be offering a range of Swarovski crystal eyeliners.

Application of the tattoos apparently takes around 10 minutes, leaving plenty of time for guests to perfect their look before heading out on the town.

Topping up the tatts: Wayne and Colleen Rooney, who are regular guests at the Burj, will now be able to top up their tattoos with 24 carat gold versions

Known as 'the only seven star hotel in the world', the Burj Al Arab is no stranger to ostentatious luxury. Last year, it announced it would provide its esteemed guests with a 24 carat plated iPad for the duration of their stay. 

The glitzy accessory, created by British company Gold and Co., is embossed with the hotel's logo and acts as a 'virtual concierge'.

The hotel is known for its pricey suites, underwater aquarium restaurant and roof terrace tennis court - the world's highest spot for a knockabout.
