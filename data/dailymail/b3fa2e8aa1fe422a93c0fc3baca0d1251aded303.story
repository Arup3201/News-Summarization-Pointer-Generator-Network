Don't they know they're meant to be at each other's throats this weekend?

Manchester United pair Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo were all smiles with City star Pablo Zabaleta as they took part in a joint Premier League Kicks charity event.

But the Argentines all did seem incredibly chummy considering the tension that's building in the city ahead of one of the biggest clashes of the season.

The trio, representing the Manchester United Foundation and City in the Community, also put some young fans through their paces at a training session on Friday afternoon - while Di Maria showed off a few flicks and tricks of his own.

They may very well have been reminiscing about their run to the World Cup final in the summer with Argentina, even though Di Maria missed the latter stages through injury.

But you imagine things will be a lot more hostile when they take to the pitch at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, with four points and five league positions currently separating the sides.

For Zabaleta, who has been at City since 2008, the derby is something he has experienced many times before.

However, for the United pair it will be a new world entirely, although Di Maria's El Clasico experience with Real Madrid, and Rojo's time playing for Sporting Lisbon against Benfica in the Derby de Lisboa   should stand them in good stead.

After years of domination over their city rivals, United have been forced into City's shadow in recent clashes.

City have won the last three  derbies in the Premier League, and you have to go as far back as December 1970 for the last time they made it four in a row in the top flight.

United have not won a derby since 2012, when a Robin van Persie free-kick gave them a last-gasp 3-2 victory.

Louis van Gaal will have captain Wayne Rooney - the top scorer in Manchester derbies - at his disposal following suspension but Manuel Pellegrini will be without playmaker David Silva, who has been ruled out for three weeks with a knee ligament injury.
