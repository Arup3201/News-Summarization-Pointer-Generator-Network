Google has revealed the full extent of its 'right to be forgotten' operation, disclosing that it has removed over 260,000 links from search results.

The European Court of Justice ruled in May that Google must remove links to websites that include content that is 'inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant'. However, the ruling has been criticised by Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, who said that criminals were using it to hide their murky pasts.

The search giant admitted this week that so far there had been 216,810 requests for web links to be removed. This resulted in 783,510 links being reviewed and 262,280 hidden from internet users. 

Ruling: The ECJ’s 'right to be forgotten' ruling allows European citizens to request that links to 'inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant' information be removed from Google search results

Notice: MailOnline has received a number of notifications requesting removal of links. The  request includes a note to say 'in many cases, the affected queries do not relate to the name of any person mentioned'

So far Google's service is restricted to its European versions, although EU data protection watchdogs want to make it global as the deleted results could be seen if a user was to switch to the .com search engine. 

Examples of links deleted by Google include a number of MailOnline articles detailing issues ranging from drug abuse to incest, murder and spying.

For instance, MailOnline received a request to remove a May 2009 article describing the sordid captivity in which Josef Fritzl kept his family.

The piece was based on extracts from the book ‘The Crimes of Josef Fritzl: Uncovering the Truth’. Publisher Harper Collins told MailOnline at the time it did not know who sent the request

Other MailOnline stories removed from Google results include claims from April 2013 that a ten-year-old girl could have died if her parents had relied on the NHS 111 helpline.

More recently, Google removed a MailOnline story about a teenager, Kyle Ivison, slapped with an Asbo for committing 40 per cent of the offences in his town.

The European Data Protection Regulation, Article 17 includes the ‘right to be forgotten and to erasure’.

Under Article 17, people who are mentioned in the data have the right to ‘obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data.'

This relates to data about the person when they were a child, when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was collected, the person who owns the content withdraws their consent, the storage period has expired, or if it was gathered illegally.

The EU defines ‘data controllers’ as ‘people or bodies that collect and manage personal data’.

The EU General Data Protection Regulation means any data controller who has been asked to remove data must ‘take all reasonable steps, including technical measures' to remove it.

If a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined. 

The content itself has not been deleted from MailOnline, but Google will not list it in search results.

Instead, users searching for the topic on google.co.uk will see a message that says: ‘Some results may have been removed under data protection law in Europe’ at the bottom of the page.

MailOnline is yet to receive any requests from Bing or Yahoo. 

In November, Culture Secretary Sajid Javid warned that terrorists were trying to use the ruling to wipe stories about their trials from Google, condemning 'Luxembourg's unelected judges' for forcing search engines to remove links to news stories.

In his speech to newspaper editors, Mr Javid said: ‘Since Luxembourg’s unelected judges created the so-called “right to be forgotten”, Google has been receiving a demand for deletion every 90 seconds,’ he told the Society of Editors conference in Southampton.

‘Each day, a thousand requests pour in from people who, for one reason or another, would prefer their pasts to be kept secret.

‘Criminals are having their convictions airbrushed from history even if they have since committed other, similar crimes.

‘Terrorists have ordered Google to cover up stories about their trials.’

Mr Javid added: ‘The “right to be forgotten” is censorship by the back door. Stories are not being deleted from archives because of the ruling, but if they cannot be found by the search engines they may as well not be there at all.’  

The European Court of Justice ruled people had a right to ask for ‘inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive’ information about them to be dropped from internet searches.

The decision – which cannot be appealed against and is binding for all EU states – affects only search results and not lawfully published and true information.

But once search engines like Google drop links to such material, it becomes almost impossible to find on the internet. Facebook was the site which had the most links removed, followed by the social network search site Profile Engine and video sharing site YouTube.    

Last year, the foundation which operates Wikipedia described the rule as 'unforgivable censorship'.

Speaking at the announcement of the Wikimedia Foundation's first-ever transparency report in London, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales said the public had the 'right to remember'.

‘We are on a path to secret, online sanitation of truthful information,’ said Geoff Brigham, general counsel at the Wikimedia Foundation.

‘No matter how well it may be intended, it is compromising human rights, the freedom of expression and access to information, and we cannot forget that.

‘So we have to expose it and we have to reject this kind of censorship.’ 

Europe's top court ruled that people have the right to have 'inadequate' and 'irrelevant' results about them wiped from the web, which has led to the search engine being bombarded with requests. 

More than 200,000 removal requests involving more than 700,000 URLs have been made to Google worldwide.

The content itself has not been deleted from MailOnline, but Google will not list it in search results.

Instead, users searching for the topic on google.co.uk will see a message that says: ‘Some results may have been removed under data protection law in Europe’ at the bottom of the page.
