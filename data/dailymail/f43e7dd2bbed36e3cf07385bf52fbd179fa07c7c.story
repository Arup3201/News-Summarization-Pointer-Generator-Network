The BBC has admitted that the clock on its homepage doesn't tell the correct time because it would take 'around 100 staffing days' to put right, and it has taken the decision to remove it from the site.

The confession came after a member of the public made an official complaint to the BBC Trust's Editorial Standards Committee (ESC) criticising the clock's inaccuracy. 

He complained after discovering that the analogue-style clock in the top left-hand corner of the site 'merely reproduces the time stored on each individual user's own computer whether this is accurate or not.'

An analogue clock was added to the BBC's homepage during a redesign in 2010 yet it doesn't tell the correct time. A member of the public made an official complaint to the Editorial Standards Committee (ESC) asking for it to be fixed or be removed. The BBC admitted it wasn't accurate but said it would take around '100 staffing days' to fix

The complainant added that the clock was 'inaccurate and misleading' and readers would 'assume' it displayed the correct time.

It was added to the homepage as part of the site's redesign in 2010.

As explained in the report: 'The complainant said that there is no other piece of information the BBC publishes which it knows is factually inaccurate or unreliable.

'The complainant believed that the clock should either be configured in such a way as to ensure the time was correct or removed from the site.'

It continued that the complainant believed visitors to the BBC website
would assume the clock was accurate and the fact it wasn't was 'not 
consistent with the Guideline requirement for the BBC to do all it can 
to ensure due accuracy in all its output.'

The Editorial Standards Committee looked into the clock complaint but ruled that the BBC had not 'knowingly and materially' misled the public. The BBC has been told to fix the clock but can do so within a 'reasonable time frame'

The BBC was forced into an embarrassing climbdown over climate change claims made in Sir David Attenborough's groundbreaking Africa series.

In the last episode of the series, entitled 'Future', Sir David discussed the challenges facing the region.

Speaking over footage of Mount Kilimanjaro, Sir David made the assertion that 'some parts of the continent have become 3.5C hotter in the past 20 years'. 

However, figures from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change show that since 1850 global temperatures have risen by 0.76C, causing widespread concern among viewers.

However, the ESC concluded that the BBC did not 'knowingly and materially' mislead website users in this instance.

The Managing Editor of BBC Online was quoted in the reported saying that making the clock accurate would 'dramatically slow down the loading of the BBC homepage' and the work needed to do it would 'take around 100 staffing days'.

Following a request for a statement, a BBC spokeswoman told MailOnline: 'The BBC takes accuracy very seriously.

'Given the technical complexities of implementing an alternative central clock, and the fact that most users already have a clock on their computer screen, the BBC has taken the decision to remove the clock from the Homepage in an upcoming update.'

The BBC is governed by a charter called the BBC Charter and Agreement.

Among other rules, the BBC is bound to report fairly, without political bias, and accurately.

Any BBC viewer can complain about BBC shows and editorial content online.

The ESC's role is to act as the final arbiter on editorial appeals made to the BBC Trust.

These include complaints about editorial content, including online.
