Louis van Gaal has welcomed a public message of support from Sir Alex Ferguson but admitted it has put more pressure on him to succeed at Manchester United.

The former Old Trafford boss backed Van Gaal, who has taken United to third place in the table despite a catalogue of injuries, saying: ‘When he gets the best players back, you watch United go – because he’s a great coach he will do well.’

The Dutchman responded at his weekly press conference by thanking Ferguson for the vote of confidence, but he feels that it has put him under even more pressure to get results.

Van Gaal enjoyed a toast with the media by sharing a glass of red wine during Tuesday's press conference

So, I'm allowed to toast with you my friends of the media. Merry Christmas, I wish your family a lot of love also. That's also important - health and happiness. Cheers.

‘It’s fantastic,’ said Van Gaal - who enjoyed a glass of red wine during the club's press conference on Tuesday afternoon ahead of their Boxing Day clash at home to Newcastle. 

‘When you come to Manchester United because I know Sir Alex supports you and when he is supporting you he is doing that not only this week but in other (press) conferences he gives.

‘He showed a lot of confidence and belief in me that I need as manager of Manchester United. You need that belief and support of managers like Sir Alex Ferguson, but also from Sir Bobby Charlton and (former United chief executive) David Gill. They have the belief and I’m very happy with that because then you can work more easily.

‘But it’s also pressure because he believes in you, and gives you that pressure that you have to get results. It’s not so easy to win Premier League matches.’

Van Gaal revealed that Chris Smalling is close to full fitness and could return to the squad against Newcastle on Boxing Day, although Ander Herrera, Marouane Fellaini, Marcos Rojo and Luke Shaw are still unavailable.

And the United boss confirmed that he will continue to switch Wayne Rooney between midfield and attack after the England captain played a more defensive role in Saturday’s draw at Aston Villa.

‘Wayne is a player who can play in different positions and I like that because I like multi-functional players,’ added Van Gaal. 

‘That’s why I can use him as a midfielder, also as a striker and an attacking midfielder. The last game he was more of a defensive midfielder but I like him closer to their area than our own goal.’
