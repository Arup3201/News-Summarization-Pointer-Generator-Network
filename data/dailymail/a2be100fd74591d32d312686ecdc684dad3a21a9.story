Beyoncé's sister has spoken out for the first time since her famous elevator bust with her brother-in-law, Jay-Z

Solange Knowles described the shocking showdown as 'that thing' and insisted that any ill feeling she had to the rap star was forgotten.

'What's important is that my family and I are all good,' Solange said. 'What we had to say collectively was in the statement that we put out, and we all feel at peace with that.'

Knowles, 28, who spoke to Lucky magazine about the bust up, was caught on a security camera in May as she lashed out at Jay-Z while her older sister stood by and said nothing.

They were in an elevator at the Standard Hotel in New York after attending the Met Gala when Knowles kicked and attempted to slap Jay-Z.

In the footage, a man who looks to be a bodyguard tries to hold Solange back but she manages to rain blows on the rapper several times, and even hits him with her purse.

The incident was caught on the elevator's camera and leaked by a hotel worker before it spread across the internet. The employee was fired by the hotel following the furor.

The following day, the two sisters and Jay Z addressed the video captured by cameras at The Standard Hotel in New York.

'As a result of the public release of the elevator security footage from Monday, May 5th, there has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident. But the most important thing is that our family has worked through it,' they said in a statement.

'Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred. They both acknowledge their role in this private matter that has played out in the public. They both have apologized to each other and we have moved forward as a united family.'

'The reports of Solange being intoxicated or displaying erratic behavior throughout that evening are simply false,' the statement continued.

'At the end of the day families have problems and we're no different. We love each other and above all we are family. We've put this behind us and hope everyone else will do the same.'

Friends speculated that Knowles, whose singing career has failed to match those of her sister, was angry at Jay-Z for not supporting her.

It was also suggested that Knowles was angry by the rap impresario getting 'too close' to his former business partner's ex-wife.

Two days after the video leaked, Beyoncé showed her public support to her sister by taking to her Instagram account on Wednesday to post tender images of the two together.
