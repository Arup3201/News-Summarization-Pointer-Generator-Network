Passengers on a U.S. Airways flight stood up in defense of a blind man who they believe was wrongly kicked off the plane.

The stand-off came after Albert Rizzi's guide dog Doxy became 'out of control' according to crew on the flight from Philadelphia to MacArthur Airport on Long Island.

Travelers claim that Mr Rizzi was mistreated by a flight attendant on the Wednesday evening flight.

Outraged: Albert Rizzi was forced off his flight home

Albert Rizzi, who is legally blind, was removed from a U.S. Airways flight on Wednesday because his guide dog was 'out of control'. However passengers quickly stood up for Mr Rizzi causing the flight to be canceled

Albert Rizzi was thrown off the U.S. Airways flight to Long Island from Philadelphia on Wednesday but passengers rushed to his defense

Passengers refused to travel after the crew told Mr Rizzi to get off the plane and were taken to Long Island by bus instead.

The
flight attendant would not allow the plane to take off because the 
guide dog was not fully under the plane's seat. The animal had become 
restless because the plane had been waiting on the tarmac for 90 
minutes.

Mr Rizzi told ABC: 'The lady comes back and gets very 
insistent, and I said, ''Look, I don't understand what you want me to 
do.''

'I said, ''He's as best as he can, he's where he needs to be.'' And I hear nobody else moving, and as I'm walking to the front, I'm like wait a second, why am I the only one getting off?'

Mr Rizzi later posted on his Facebook account: 'I cannot believe this. I 
was removed from the plane that I was supposed to be on to go home from 
Philadelphia because my dog couldn't sit in a spot for an hour and a 
half on the tarmac such a joke.

'So now I am in Philadelphia trying to 
figure out what I'm going to do to get home. I have never been so 
annoyed flying US Airways all year and this is the way the stewardess 
treatment!'

Mr Rizzi described the passengers who stood by him as 'remarkable'.

Miriam Woods Baxter commented: 'My brother-in-law was on the plane with you. He is disgusted with the way you were treated. I'm sorry you were treated this way.'

Passengers stood up for the disabled passenger which led to the captain asking all of those onboard to leave the plane.

Travelers who took the bus arrived on Long Island around 2.30am while others spent the night in Philadelphia.

U.S. Airways claimed that Mr Rizzie was verbally abusive but that an investigation into the incident would take place.

An airline spokesman told MailOnline today: U.S. Airways transports more than 80 million customers each year and ensures that all customers, including those with disabilities, are treated with dignity and respect.

'We’re particularly sensitive to those customers who travel with service animals since we partner with Assistance Dogs International (ADI), an organization that trains and places assistance dogs around the world. US Airways employees volunteer to travel with and work with assistance dogs in training to help them prepare for travel with disabled partners.

'In this instance, Mr. Rizzi became disruptive and refused to comply with crew member instructions when the flight attendant asked him to secure his service dog at his feet. As a result of his disruptive behavior, the crew returned to the gate and removed Mr Rizzi and his service dog from the flight.

The flight eventually cancelled and we transported Mr Rizzi, his service dog, and the rest of our passengers on the flight to ISP by bus.'

Last week, the airline was forced to deny that crew members had used racial slurs against actor Brandon T. Jackson, who was kicked off a flight at a Phoenix layover because of unruly behavior.

Mr Jackson, best known for his role as Alpa Chino in the movie Tropic Thunder, had been drinking on the New York City to Phoenix flight on Monday night and became upset when flight attendants stopped serving him alcohol.

He sent out 21 tweets about the experience and claimed a flight attendant 'called me the N-word'.

'We've spoken with the crew members involved and they deny any use of the N-word or racist slurs with Mr Jackson,' said U.S. Airways spokesman Andrew Christie.

U.S. Airways canceled the flight and provided buses for the passengers instead
