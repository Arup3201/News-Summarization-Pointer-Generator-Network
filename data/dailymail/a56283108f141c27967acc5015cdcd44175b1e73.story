A 94-year-old housewife - said to be the inspiration behind Australian comedian Barry Humphries' Dame Edna Everage character - believes she has the answer to marital bliss.

And it involves women becoming the 'perfect' wife by learning to make deviled tripe, kerosene soap and Pavlova, understanding how to cure a goldfish of constipation (by feeding it Epsom salts), and remembering to cover grey hairs with a brewed mixture of tea ans sage leaves.

Tasmania's Marjorie Bligh also has tips on clearing possums from the ceiling, smudging your cheeks with beetroot instead of rouge, using spent matchstick nubs during eyebrow liner emergencies, and filling basins with water before removing one's dentures, to avoid breaking them.

Marjorie's tips involve becoming the 'perfect' wife by learning to make deviled tripe, kerosene soap and Pavlova... understanding how to cure a goldfish of constipation

Bligh is now the subject of a new biography - Housewife Superstar! Advice (and Much More) From a Nonagenarian Domestic Goddess - by novelist Danielle Wood.

The Faber & Faber publication is packed with top tips for industrious spouses, and is even sanctioned by Humphries himself, who, despite denying his character was inspired totally by Bligh, does say: 'I don't think Edna has ever admired anybody as much as she admires Marjorie Bligh.'

Marjorie has been Australia's go-to domestic goddess for some time. She first began publishing her home tips in a newspaper column, and her first book, At Home with Marjorie Blackwell, was published in 1965.

Danielle Wood's biography of the Tasmanian domestic diva involves the ABC of happy marriage and recipes for nostalgic treats including sponge cake

Marjorie - who has been married three 
times, twice widowed and once divorced - has since shared her practical knowledge, life experiences and unique 
philosophy in six self-published books, including At Home with Marjorie 
Bligh, Marjorie Blighâ€™s A-Z of Gardening and Life Is For Living.

Wood, who spent plenty of time with Bligh in order to write the book, peppers her new tome with Bligh's nostalgic recipes for sponges, cakes and scones, along with the odd bit of poetry.
