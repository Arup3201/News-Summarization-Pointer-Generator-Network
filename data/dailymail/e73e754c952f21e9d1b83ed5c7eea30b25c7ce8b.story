Widespread hailstone, heavy rain and gusts of wind swept across Britain today, creating dark and gloomy grey skies.

While the wet forecast dampened spirits, it was welcomed by water companies desperate for rainfall.

Showers of hailstone hit several parts 
of Britain and a Kent police spokesman advised motorists to adapt their 
driving after the sudden downpours affecting the east of the county.

Spring has not yet come: During the last couple of years Britain has had a lot of warm and dry weather in April so these chilly and unsettled conditions have come as something of a surprise

During the last couple of years 
Britain has had a lot of warm and dry weather in April so these chilly 
and unsettled conditions have come as something of a surprise.

But they are a normal set of circumstances for April and it is the last two years that have been rather unusual.

A Met Office spokesperson said 'This is very typical April showers weather and the last few years have been the exception.'

But anyone hoping for a relaxation of the hosepipe ban will be sadly disappointed, as experts warn it would take more than a month of heavy rain to replenish water levels.

Tonight showers will gradually become lighter and more isolated through the evening, with many areas becoming dry and clear overnight.

But temperatures look set to fall again, with frost developing, especially in rural parts. 

Tomorrow the weather is not expected to be as as heavy and thundery as recent days, with some sunshine breaking through, but it will still be quite cold and maximum temperatures are predicted to peak at 11 °C.

The weekend looks set to be slightly 
drier than the past week and the Met Office have predicted it will be a 
'fine and sunny on Sunday, although slightly cold as temperatures will 
only reach 8C and 9C (46F - 48F).'

There were major contrasts in the weather 
across the country, while parts of the south were covered with hailstone
and heavy rain, The Grand National at Aintree, still managed go ahead.

Lucky escape: Today a family escaped unharmed after their house on the Isle of Wight was struck by lightning

Force of nature: A small fire broke out, but a hail storm put out the flames before it spread

The sun may not have shone in Merseyside but the gathering storm clouds were no deterrent for the ladies
of Liverpool, who gathered today for the first day of the world famous 
race meet.

Paying no 
heed to the chill in the air, they donned their best outfits for the 
occasion - the weather was more sociable than seen further down south 
with many areas hit by hailstone storms and heavy rain.

The strong thunderstorms 
across Britain resulted in a family running from their home after their house was 
struck by lightning earlier this afternoon.

Dave and Vav Simon and their 
14-year-old daughter Ruby and Vav's daughter Vikie Eastwood, along with 
two dogs, were in the house at Aldermoor Farm, Upton Road, Ryde, Isle of
Wight when lighting hit the roof at around 2.40pm.

A small fire broke out, but a hail storm put out the flames before it spread.

Mr Simon said: 'Everyone is safe, everyone is out of the house. My daughter Ruby is in a bit of shock, but she is all right.

'The
electricity came down the TV aerial. Slates have been blown off the 
roof and it brought the upstairs ceiling down and the electrics were 
blown.

'The electricity went off, then flickered and then there was this bang.

'My daughter started screaming from upstairs, the ceiling came down on top of her, but she was not hurt.

'They are inspecting the damage, but we certainly won't be able to sleep here tonight.'

Newport
station manager for the Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service Julian 
Trout said: 'There is severe damage to the roof and inside the property.

'Lightning also struck a telegraph pole two fields away, which was dealt with by fire crews from Sandown.'

A
Southern Electric spokesman said around 2,300 homes were without power 
in parts of Ryde, Ashey, Smallbrook, Havenstreet and Bembridge.

Power is expected to be restored in stages by the end of today, the spokesman said.

Met Office forecaster Charlie Powell warned that it will be around a degree colder each day until Sunday.

'The areas facing the biggest risk of
showers are the eastern part of England and Scotland,' he added. 
'Although this will die away a bit overnight it will be back tomorrow, 
when there could even be hail.

'The unsettled conditions will 
continue until next week, when we will start to see bands of rain 
instead of showers, which means more prolonged wet weather.'

Around 50mm is expected to fall by Sunday, which is the same as the total rainfall expected for the whole month.

But much more rain would be needed to fill rivers and reservoirs and relieve the drought in the South and East.

Weather experts said that areas affected by drought need more than 400mm of rain to get back to normal levels.

In Scotland, ski resorts have been told that they may be able to reopen thanks to a chance of snowfall.

It is a stark contrast to last April -
which was the hottest since 1910, with temperatures regularly topping 
25c (77F) -  and comes just weeks after a March heatwave that sent 
scores of Brits to the beach.

Mr Goodfellow said: 'We're going to 
need an awful lot of rain over a great deal of time to solve the drought
problem. Anything is going to help, but it does not look like what 
we're going to see over the next few days will be sustainable.'

Days at the races: Despite the cold weather the crowd at Aintree races, Liverpool all donned their traditional bright outfits

Lucky: Compared to the hailstone in the south of the country, the race goers were lucky with their sun, if not chilly weather

The Environment Agency yesterday warned that drought-afflicted areas, like much of southern of England, are at higher risk of flash flooding, especially in built-up areas.

Dry, compacted soils mean that rainfall is less easily absorbed into the ground, increasing the likelihood of flooding if the country is hit by storms.

This was seen in June and July 2007, when a dry winter and spring were followed by devastating floods, which hit the West Country, Midlands and Yorkshire.

The forecast looks bleak for those heading to Grand National at Aintree on Saturday.

Steady rain is forecast in the Liverpool area over the next few days and conditions on the course are expected to be the muddiest and most difficult since the famous mudbath of 2001, when Richard Guest splashed to victory riding Red Marauder.

Clerk of the course Andrew Tulloch expects the ground to be 'soft' - but expects the race to go ahead, regardless how muddy it gets.

He said: 'We've had at least 13mm of steady drizzle and, looking at the radar, there should be more to come on Tuesday with further possible showers on Wednesday and Thursday.'

'The grass is in excellent condition, partly as a result of the warm winter we had, and that makes a difference, as it will help soak up a lot of the moisture,' he told the Guardian.

'But the going is already soft in most places on the National course and we're definitely looking at conditions being on the slow side. We've been aiming to get something between good and good to soft.'

Changing weather: Three day weather forecast from Friday to Sunday

Lightning flashes during a thunderstorm

It has been a while since such widespread outbreaks of thunderstorms, so this is an ideal opportunity to look at lightning and its varieties.

Most people make a distinction between sheet lightning and forked lightning.

However, sheet lightning is merely a lightning stroke within a cloud or between clouds (or below the horizon). It is obscured by the clouds themselves, making them diffusely refulgent.

This is known as cloud-to-cloud lightning, caused by differing electric potential within a cloud or across clouds. Sometimes it is visible, especially in mature thunder clouds, as a filigree wandering across the underside of the anvil - hence the name 'anvil crawler.'

The most dangerous, though, is cloud-to-ground lightning, often shortened to CG, caused by the potential between the negatively charged base of the cloud and the positively charged ground.

Ground-to-cloud lightning (GC) is rarer, initiated from the ground rather than the cloud, often by a tall building or tower.

Most CG strikes comprise negative strokes (negative charge in the cloud base transferring to the ground) but about 5% are positive strokes, which are more powerful.

These originate high in the cloud where there can be a strong positive charge; occasionally this will be in the anvil itself.

The lightning may hit the ground directly beneath the cloud but can strike below the tenuous edges of the anvil, sometimes more than nine miles (15km) away from the cloud's centre.

This can give the appearance of appearing out of nowhere - hence the figurative basis of the metaphorical phrase a bolt from the blue.'
