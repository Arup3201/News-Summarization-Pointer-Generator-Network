The Abbott Government has come up against one of its first big hurdles since the Federal Budget was announced on Tuesday.

New South Wales will not take on the proposed changes that will allow hospitals to charge patients $7 for a visit - the same price people will now have to cough up for a trip to their GP.

The Government announced in the budget that restrictions which currently prevent public hospitals charging fees will be lifted.

But NSW Health Minister Jillian Skinner said the new fee, designed to deter patients from visiting hospitals instead of GPs to avoid paying, would not be taken on board.

Open to 'horse trading': Prime Minster Tony Abbott has said he knows he will need to negotiate to get tough new budget through the Senate

'The NSW Government will not implement a co-payment for patients accessing our emergency departments,' Mrs Skinner told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Meantime, Prime Minster Tony Abbott has said he's not opposed to 'horse trading' in order to get the budget through the Senate.

The Labor Party and The Greens are set to allow the budget appropriation bills though parliament, the first of which was filed just hours after the announcement.

Budget appropriation bills are designed to channel money through to departments and agencies, and draft laws to impose a deficit levy on high-income earners were introduced into the lower house on Tuesday night.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has confirmed Labor will vote against the coalition's move to introduce a $7 Medicare co-payment, as well as plans to hike the fuel excise and change the pension age.

Treasurer Joe Hockey insists the government is not cutting pension payments - they're just not going to increase as quickly as they do now.

From late-2017 the indexed increases to the age pension will be linked to the consumer price index instead of the highest rate available, generally male average earnings.

With inflation running at about 2.5 per cent pensioners will find their payments increasing by less than they've been used to in recent times.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten vowed to fight unpopular budget measures outside Parliament House in Canberra on Wednesday

LABOR TO FIGHT DOCTOR CHARGES, PETROL EXCISE

The pension is just one of a string of unpopular budget measures announced Tuesday, and Labor is vowing to try and block some of the key changes.

'Putting up everyone's petrol bill we think is a bad idea in the current circumstances,' Mr Shorten told the Nine Network on Wednesday.

'We will fight - and I don't know if we'll win the arguments against Tony Abbott and their bad budget - but we will fight and fight and fight for Medicare.

'We get that you've got to improve the health system and make it more cost effective but you don't do that by stopping people at the door of the doctor's surgery.'

OPPOSITION QUIET ON DEFICIT LEVY BLOCK

But Mr Shorten refused to confirm whether the party would support the deficit levy on high income earners.

'What we think is it is a broken promise,' Mr Shorten said when asked about the coalition's plan to hike tax on people earning more than $180,000 a year.

'We haven't made a final position on that.'

Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen said the Medical Research Future Fund was a great idea, but should not be funded by the Medicare co-payment.

Tony Abbott has defended his government's unpopular first budget, saying it's 'fundamentally honest'

'It should not be funded by Australia's sick and vulnerable people,' he told Sky News.

'It should not be funded by people who may be on low and middle incomes who need to go the doctor.'

LABOR OPPOSES PENSION CHANGES

He said Labor would oppose increasing the pension age to 70 because Treasurer Joe Hockey had failed to justify the decision.

'He says Australians should work longer than anybody else in the developed world,' Mr Bowen said.

'Not one country in the OECD has a pension age of 70.'

BUDGET MEASURES 'NECESSARY', SAYS ABBOTT

'I want to do what's right for the country, not what's right for the government,' Mr Abbott told the Nine Network on Wednesday.

'We are not going to cook the books, we are not going to make a series of rosy assumptions,' he said.

The government cannot keep using its credit card to pay the nation's mortgage, he said.

BROKEN PROMISES

Asked repeatedly whether the budget broke his key election promises, he told Network Ten: 'I think we have kept faith with the Australian public.'

But he acknowledged: 'Some people will be disappointed, some people will feel let down.'

TWITTER REACTION

Twitter users had a field day with Tuesday night's budget.

The hashtag #ThreeWordBudget is top-trending in Australia as social media users express their reaction to the measures detailed by Treasurer Joe Hockey overnight.

TV host Charlie Pickering went for 'Less for more'. Actor Rhys Muldoon wrote 'Opus Dei Cuts', referring to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's links with the Catholic Church.

'Winter is coming' wrote social media commentator Jamila Rizvi in a clever reference to the fantasy television series Game of Thrones.

'Mine, all mine', 'Heart of Darkness', 'Fair Go Gone', 'Every promise broken' and 'Out of Touch' were some of the harsher tweets aimed at the first-term coalition government.

'Pass the Grange?' Cameron Brown tweeted, referring to the infamous bottle of red wine that triggered the resignation of former NSW premier Barry O'Farrell.

'Missing Gillard yet?' wrote producer Karen Pickering, while media commentator Jenna Price tweeted 'vote them out'.
