Amelia Williams, of Toxteth, Liverpool, has been jailed for more than four years for mauling a stranger in the street in the Kensington area of the city during a zombie-like 'biting' attack just so she could go to prison and 'get an education'

A mother-of-two mauled a stranger in the street punching her 30 times and biting her hand in a zombie-like 'biting' attack so she could get an education in jail, a court heard.

Former hairdresser Amelia Williams, 33, of Toxteth, Liverpool, had wanted to get better qualifications but she did not want her 'hard working family' or the state to pay for her to go on a course.

Instead she randomly ambushed Sharon Bentley, 54, punched her 30 times in the face, then sank her teeth into the victim’s hand as she screamed for help - not realising taxpayers would be funding a jail education anyway.

Her counsel Paul Lewis said his client carried out the attack, in Kensington, Liverpool, because she did not want the state to fund a college course.

But
 he added: 'She has failed to register that the state would pay for her 
time in jail anyway. The motive for this attack is peculiar.'

Administration worker Mrs Bentley who had been waiting for a bus put up a fight as Williams also tried to snatch her handbag.

The
 terrified victim clung onto the bag and the struggle became so violent 
it spilled out into the middle of the road and into the path of traffic.

The attack ended when a passing taxi driver stopped to help the victim and followed Williams until she was arrested nearby.

Williams
 - who has a record for violence - claimed she carried out the attack 
'as an attempt at education' she hoped to get behind bars.

Sharon Bentley says she has barely left her own home since the attack and is now 'frightened to go out'. She was punched 30 times in the face during the attack in the Kensington district of Liverpool

But as she began four and a half years in jail, Mrs Bentley, who is now scarred for life issued a statement telling of her ordeal.

She said: 'There is no easy fix to this and it is just a waiting game.

'Since the attack, I have barely moved out of my home. I am frightened to go out. I am due to return to work at the end of the month which I have to do. I don’t know how I am going to commute to and from work.

'I have always used public transport and I can’t afford to get taxis. I tend to wake up throughout the night every hour or so.

'I have relived this attack from start to finish and find myself in an emotional mess on quite a few occasions.'

Earlier 
Liverpool Crown Court was told the attack occurred when Mrs Bentley was 
waiting at the bus stop in Kensington district of the city at 5.30am on 
April 3 this year.

Mr Rob Jones, prosecuting, said: 'Mrs Bentley describes the female shouting at her and punching her all over her face and body.

'She said she was punched maybe 30 times. She was terrified. She began to shout for attention and the struggle continued. It is quite clear that the two females found themselves in the middle of the main carriageway.'

Taxi driver John McGuire stopped his car to intervene when Williams grabbed her victim’s arm and bit into her hand, causing it to bleed heavily.

Williams walked away but as police were called Mr McGuire followed her and she was arrested when she attempted to run away. Williams admitted robbery.

Passing sentence Judge Alan Conrad, QC, told Williams: 'You are 33 and you have a substantial record of violence. It is clear that you will attack members of the public and figures of authority when it suits you.

'This is a bad case of street robbery. The injuries were painful, distressing and lasting.'

After the case Det Sgt Sandra Nelson, from Merseyside Police said: “This attack was one of the most violent I have ever dealt with.”
