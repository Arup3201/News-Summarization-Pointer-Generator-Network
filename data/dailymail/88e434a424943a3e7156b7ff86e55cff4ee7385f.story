With her flowing raven locks, slender figure and rouge lips, 28-year-old Jessie sounds like the type of woman who would easily turn men's heads.

However, all is not as it seems, because Jessie is actually a man called Joel who likes to dress up like a living doll.

The Essex-born bartender is one of a growing number of people who like to wear rubber suits, which is documented on TLC's My Strange Addiction.

Joel, a 28-year-old bartender from Essex, loves getting dressed up as a woman - and his girlfriend even helps him get into character  

Unlike transgender people, ‘maskers’, or ‘rubber dollers’ as they’re also known, do not feel born in the wrong body. 

For them, they say dressing up as a member of the opposite sex is a simply a way to have fun.

Joel  has been dressing up this way since he was 15 and estimates he has spent £9,900 ($15,000) on suits and masks over the years. 

He has just moved in with his girlfriend Mel, who is aware of his obsession and supports him. She helps him get ready - and is on hand as he reveals his alter-ego look to some friends for the first time.

For Joel, dressing up is all about escapism.

‘I get enjoyment out of it, I get a sense of escapism out of it,’ he reveals. ‘I'm just out to have fun. It's like the extension of another persona within me that just wants to go out and have fun.

‘The conundrum is people ask: “What do you do when you get dressed up?” And the answer is: not much.

‘Sometimes I just take photos to put up on masking websites, other times it just happens to be who I want to be that day.’

Speaking about why he dresses up, Joel said: 'I get enjoyment out of it, I get a sense of escapism out of it'

But Joel’s masking career hasn’t always gone smoothly. While girlfriend Mel is happy to accept his alter-ego Jessie, he spent 15 years hiding her from his parents – and from his neighbours.

‘I wouldn't walk 20 steps down the road dressed as a doll because I know general society in the area we live in would be very, very against it,’ he explains. ‘Who knows what could happen?’

The show also feature 70-year-old 'Robert' from Newport Beach, California, who had hidden his addiction for 12 years.

He loves to dressed as Sherry in a rubber suit and blonde wig and is part of a huge online community.

The show's cameras follow Robert as he travels to the Rubber Doll World Rendevous in Minneapolis for the first time to meet his online pals, many of whom are married with children but who all love to dress up in their silicone alter-egos too. 

But while many of the maskers who appear in the documentary say it’s all about having fun; for 70-year-old Robert, matters don’t appear quite so simple.

'That's why I do this,’ he breathes as he pouts at his reflection in the bathroom mirror, ‘because I think I look amazing.

‘I just can't believe that's a 70-year-old man in the mirror and that's why I do this,’ he continues. ‘If I saw a 70-year-old man in the mirror I would quit this tomorrow. ‘

Asked what he sees when he looks at his dolled up reflection, he replies: 'An exciting looking female,’ adding: ‘If I saw a woman like this and she asked me to go hang out, I'd say yeah.'

For him, the appeal of Sherry seems to lie partly in the fact that for him, dating real women has been something of a disappointment.

'They're not freaky people,  they're just like you and me,' explains Barbie Ramos, the owner of Femskin, a company that makes the $850 (£518) custom-made silicone outfits worn by maskers

‘You see, after all, I'm 70 years old and I've tried dating, and when I'm dating, the women I meet are generally 55 to well up into their 60s,’ he explains.

‘Some of them are in really good shape for their age but they don't look anything like this and it's very difficult to date when you have this to come home to.

‘They’re not freaky people, they’re not weird, they’re just like you and me,’ explains Barbie Ramos, the owner of Femskin, a company that makes the $850 (about £518) custom-made silicone outfits worn by maskers.

‘They’re just like what they call “vanilla people” - that’s you and me - except for at night or on special occasions, they like to put on a mask. Why not?’

Her son Adam, who also works at Femskin, adds: ‘I don't think it would be fair to call them gay or even attracted to other men.’

‘It's about fun. A lot of men have fun by pretending to be women. Not all of them even want to be hot. Some want to be nasty hags.’

One masker who is far less reticent about his hobby is Jon, a Minneapolis father-of-six who works as a forklift driver in a warehouse.

According to Jon, not only does masking make him feel good, it also helps him to bond with his daughters.

‘I try to find ways to fit in and be involved with the daughters, and that sometimes means make-up and fingernails and things like that as well,’ he explains.

‘You don't have to have your guard up and necessarily be afraid of other people if you want to dress in a way that makes you feel really good.

‘One guy in particular that I trust at work - he knows that I put on the boobies!’

The show documents some of the maskers meeting each other for the first time 

Adam Ramos, who works at Femskin with his mother, said: 'I don't think it would be fair to call them gay or even attracted to other men'

But not everyone is quite so understanding. Jon’s wife Sunny is his second, met and wed after his first marriage broke up because of his penchant for rubber dolling.

‘This does affect my relationships because I make my priorities and sometimes other people are not happy about my choices,’ he admits.

So is it all worth it? Jon’s friend ‘Vanessa’, a 56-year-old who is also father of six, thinks it is.

‘When I'm in my male mode, I go out in public and I just blend in,’ he confesses. ‘When I walk down the street, people don't pay any attention to me.

‘But when I dress up, put this mask on and the wig, it's like being a beautiful woman walking down the street.

‘You become one of the beautiful people and you draw a lot of attention, and attention is not something I've had a lot of.’
