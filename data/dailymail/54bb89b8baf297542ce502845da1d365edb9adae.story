He was less than impressed when he heard that James Franco and Seth Rogen were planning to assassinate him in spoof Hollywood movie The Interview, but it seems there are some films that North Korea's Kim Jong-Un does approve of.

But with titles like Urban Girl Comes to Get Married, A True Daughter of the Party, The Bloodstained Route Map and Sea of Blood, sitting through them might prove a challenge.

Despite the uninspiring titles, North Korea boasts a thriving film industry, with the biggest film studio, which has sets that include a Chinatown and an English country village, just outside Pyongyang.

Popular: Cinema is hugely popular in North Korea but all films are made by the regime and feature propaganda

Rousing: Most of the films have an inspiring message and feature views of North Korean capital Pyongyang (pictured)

Heroic: Typically, films show North Koreans performing heroic deeds with South Koreans and Westerners often cast as villains

And action! Tourists often find themselves unexpectedly starring in films - the man waving is the North Korean version of Steven Spielberg

Starring role: Mr Lafforgue and his fellow passengers were asked to repeatedly walk down this set of airport steps before catching their flight

'Although the film offer is usually quite poor, the people of North Korea are very fond of cinema,' says photographer Eric Lafforgue, who went behind the scenes at the Chollima Studios and even found time to star in a North Korean movie himself.

'So was their Dear Leader Kim Jong-Il, who described it as "the most powerful medium for educating the masses". In fact, he liked it so much, he even kidnapped South Korean director Shin Sang-Ok and his wife in 1978 and held them until 1986.'

Despite the Shins escape, North Korea continues to make films, although most double as propaganda with tales of perfidious Westerners and heroic North Koreans dominating the script.

Apart from within universities where films like Gladiator and Titanic are shown to language students, Western films are not allowed, although that didn't stop Kim Jong-Un from taking exception to The Interview.

Indeed, so offended was Kim by his cinematic death, he declared it 'an act of war' while hackers allegedly funded by North Korea tapped into computers belonging to backers Sony and stole thousands of documents - including some extremely embarrassing emails.

One saw producer Scott Rudin describe Angelina Jolie as 'a minimally talented spoilt brat', while another exchange saw Rudin claim to have no idea who actor Michael Fassbender was before going on to crack jokes about the star's manhood.

 Such theatrics would never happen in North Korea, says Lafforgue, where all actors are state-sponsored and tourists frequently find themselves becoming accidental guest stars.

'The actors have to reread their scripts just before shooting starts,' says Lafforgue of his day on set with North Korea's acting A-list. 'There's a real military atmosphere and discipline is very strict.' 

North Korea's love of film began with Kim Jong-Il who, according to the regime, once shot a film personally - about the founding member of the dynasty, Kim Il-Sung - and earned himself the title of 'Genius of Cinema' in the process.

He also managed more than 600 visits to the Chollima Studios during his tenure and was instrumental in ensuring a film about the 2009 release of two American tourists held prisoner by the regime was made.

The story of the release, which came during the visit of former president Bill Clinton, was given a North Korean twist and turned into an epic about the strength and power of a dynasty that could 'force' American leaders to do its bidding.

Superstars: These photos are of North Korea's most talented stars but unlike Hollywood's talent, they are paid by the government

So important are these films to the North Korean regime, according to Lafforgue, visits to the cinema are completely free. 'People don't usually have to pay an entrance fee,' he confirms. 'It is seen by people as an opportunity to relax and have fun.

'Sometimes there is a real fight to enter the movie theatre as so many people who want to go at the same time. My guide told me that he sometimes had to stand up to see the film as all the seats are full.'

Those who can't make it into the cinema cannot avoid the propaganda that accompanies the films, however. According to Lafforgue, Pyongyang and other cities are peppered with film posters, many of which are painted onto the walls and all of which push regime messages. 

'Most of the time, the posters show North Korean heroes who suffered for their nation, not people smiling,' says Lafforgue. 'They look more like the usual propaganda posters than movie ads.'

And while James Franco and Seth Rogen remain unlikely to ever find themselves adorning a North Korean wall, one much-loved Western figure can be spotted everywhere.

'Mickey Mouse is really popular,' says Lafforgue. 'They even use old Mickey Mouse movies to teach video editing techniques. Most of the North Koreans think Mickey is Chinese though.' 

Heroine: Films such as Sea of Blood and The Bloodstained Route Map focus on the heroics of North Korea's soldiers

Permanent: In Pyongyang and other cities, the posters are painted onto walls and remain in place for years

New releases: Film posters show some of the new movies available to watch, many of which offer a North Korean take on current events

Power: Others, such as this one about the country's rocket programme, emphasise the power of North Korea

Unsmiling: According to Lafforgue, it is rare to see a smiling actor on a film poster because most films are preoccupied with martyrdom 

Loved: Old Mickey Mouse films are used to teach video editing techniques, although most of the students believe Mickey is Chinese

Looks familiar? This part of the Chollima Movie Studios is supposed to stand in for London

Home from home: The British countryside is also represented, in the shape of a series of picturesque period cottages

Free: Because of its use as propaganda, going to the cinema is completely free in North Korea

Knock-offs: Despite Western films ostensibly being banned, some Chinese copies - as well as local films - are available as copied DVDS
