James Rodriguez has revealed he is eager to emulate Angel di Maria's success at Real Madrid and make history with the club. 

Di Maria moved to Manchester United in a £60million deal having played an important role in Madrid's Champions League victory as Carlo Ancelotti's side achieved La Decima.

Colombian international James, who moved to the Bernabeu in the summer following an impressive showing at the World Cup, is keen to follow in the footsteps of the former Real playmaker.

'As for Di María, he is a great player. He made history here and I have a lot of respect for him,' James told reporters.

'I have only just joined, but I want to make history with Real Madrid as well.

'I am comfortable here and I want to do everything the coach tells me to do. I just want to help so we can win.'

While Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in Sunday's 5-0 win over Athletic Bilbao, James reserved special praise for striker Karim Benzema who netted a brace.

'Benzema scores and provides assists and we all hope he can keep hitting the mark.' said Real Madrid's No 10. 

'The feeling is that everything went perfectly, although we've already had good games. We are all playing well. We have dangerous players up front and we are strong at the back.'
