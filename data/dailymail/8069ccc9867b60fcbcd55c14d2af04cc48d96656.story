His pretty-boy looks and rise to fame as a fresh-faced teenager made him a big hit with young music fans worldwide.

But the parents of his impressionable admirers will be less than happy about a confession by singer Paolo Nutini – that he has smoked cannabis every day for the past ten years.

The star, who was born in Paisley, Renfrewshire, told music magazine Q that the drug helps him to cope with fame and is no worse than alcohol.

Paolo Nutini says that he has smoked cannabis every day for the past ten years

Nutini, 27, called for a more tolerant attitude to cannabis by authorities across the world before admitting it can cause problems for some users.

But his comments were condemned by a leading expert who claimed the star’s views could encourage more youngsters to dabble with the drug.

Nutini was asked during the interview for Q if he had smoked pot.

He replied: ‘Every day since I was about 16. Can the world please get to grips with marijuana? How long can this go on?

‘Don’t get me wrong, you can give it to the wrong person, marijuana can spawn all kinds of things, but no more so than alcohol.’

He also defended boy band One Direction after two members reportedly smoked cannabis, adding that raunchy singer Miley Cyrus was a worse influence on youngsters.

Nutini said: ‘They are men now. Let’s flip it and look at the female global pop stars out there.

‘Sexualisation isn’t the problem, it’s a case of class. I saw a photo of Miley Cyrus with her leotard pulled up – is that cool? And One Direction can’t have a joint? They’re the bad role models? Come on.’

But Professor Neil McKeganey of the Centre for Drugs Misuse Research:

‘He (Nutini) has clearly failed to understand the terrible impact drug abuse has had throughout Scotland and particularly in the community from which he comes.

‘Paolo is a fantastic musician but when it comes to drugs he’s just another pop star on pot.

‘It’s grossly irresponsible for him to be effectively advocating for young people to use cannabis.

‘It’s quite likely that comments from someone who has his celebrity status, who is revered by many young people, could have a hugely negative impact on young people.’

Professor McKeganey added: ‘We know cannabis substantially reduces intelligence and it also affects areas of the brain associated with judgment and can lead to an increase in serious mental health problems.

‘If he has been taking cannabis for as long as he claims, he may well  be experiencing some of the psychological effects of its extended use.’

Tory MSP John Lamont also condemned the pop star for setting a bad example to young fans.

He said: ‘Paolo has to realise he’s a role model for many and this kind of remark can be extremely damaging.’

Police Scotland yesterday warned that there was ‘no safe way to take drugs’.

A spokesman said: ‘Everyone needs to be aware of the short and longer-terms dangers. You can never be sure of what you are taking  or what effect it could have on you.’

A spokesman for Nutini declined to comment last night.

It is understood police are not planning to take action against the singer following the disclosures.

Police sources said such inquiries cannot be retrospective.
