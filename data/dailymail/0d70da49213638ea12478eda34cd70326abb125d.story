Ralph Ellis runs you through what we've learned this weekend, from Emre Can's new deeper role for Liverpool, to the telepathic partnership between Diego Costa and Oscar at Chelsea while Mesut Ozil’s bright cameo against Stoke may be a sign of better things to come from the German star. Elsewhere, Martin Kelly is quietly rediscovering his form at Crystal Palace while Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is making great strides as manager of Burton. 

1. Moving Emre Can into a back three has made a major difference for Liverpool as he gets the scope to start attacks from deep. The 20-year-old, originally signed from Bayer Leverkusen for nearly £10million as a midfielder, frequently stepped forward from the back at Sunderland.

With the confidence of two other centre backs to protect him he found a team-mate with 47 of his 51 passes.

2. Diego Costa must love working alongside Oscar – Chelsea’s Brazilian playmaker supplied the striker with 10 passes during the 78 minutes both were on the pitch against Newcastle, including the brilliant backheel that set up Costa’s 15th goal of the season. No other Chelsea player gave Costa the ball so many times – but the partnership is a bit of a one-way affair. Costa found Oscar just once.

3. It can’t help Queens Park Rangers in their quest for a first away point of a troubled season on the road that they are continually out worked by opponents.To be fair to Joey Barton, he covered 7.2 miles at Burnley, but next best in terms of distance run was the 6.5 miles of centre half Steven Caulker. Sean Dyche’s side, for whom the ever energetic George Boyd inevitably went furthest with 8.0 miles, had six players in all who beat Caulker’s total.

4. Arsene Wenger will be hoping Mesut Ozil’s bright cameo display against Stoke proves he’s benefited from the enforced rest caused by knee ligament problems that have kept him out since October. The German World Cup winner got on the ball 22 times in a busy 17 minutes after replacing Olivier Giroud and gave it away only twice.

5. Marvin Emnes might be the only man at Swansea delighted to see the back of Wilfried Bony as the Ivory Coast striker disappears first to the Africa Cup of Nations and then to Manchester City. The 26-year-old Dutch striker has started just three games in nearly a year since moving to the Liberty Stadium and his handful of appearances off the bench total just 143 minutes. 

He’s capable of more though – his arrival as a sub against West Ham saw him create the Swans equaliser which the dubious goals committee will award either to Bafetimbi Gomis or as a Mark Noble own goal.

6. Claudio Yacob could be the big winner from the arrival of Tony Pulis as the new manager at West Brom. The Argentine midfield enforcer was always one of the first names on the team sheet when Steve Clarke was in charge, but had started only once in the Premier League all season before Pulis put him into the team against Hull. 

The 27-year-old made a difference, only giving the ball away four times as his ability to protect the defence saw Albion keep a clean sheet in a home Premier League game for only the third time all season.

7. Martin Kelly is quietly rediscovering the form that when he was at Liverpool earned him a solitary England cap. At 24 the Crystal Palace defender is benefiting from playing regular Premier League football for the first time since his breakthrough season at Anfield in 2010-11. 

Switched to left back against Spurs from his more natural role on the right, he snuffed out the threat of Andros Townsend – winning every one of his six tackles.

8. Tottenham youngster Alex Pritchard will be watching the breakthroughs made by Harry Kane and Ryan Mason at White Hart Lane while he spends the season on loan at Brentford.

The 21-year-old, among the nominations for League One player of the year when he spent the last campaign with Swindon, has looked equally assured in the Championship and gave another outstanding display in the 1-0 win over Rotherham that kept Mark Warburton’s side in the play-off places.

Attacking midfielder Pritchard has played just seven minutes in the Premier League for Spurs, but Mauricio Pochettino’s fondness for promoting homegrown kids might offer him fresh chances when his loan is over in the summer.

9. Dean Saunders had been gaining a solid reputation in management in the lower leagues until he went to Wolves and everything went wrong. Some 18 months later he’s taken charge of Crawley Town in League One on an interim basis while John Gregory undergoes heart surgery.

There are promising signs that Saunders can rebuild his career – the 2-2 draw with high-flying MK Dons made it two games without defeat for a side that had lost three in a row before Deano took charge.

10. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink’s first venture into being a boss in England has started well – a 2-1 win over Mansfield moved his Burton side into second place in League Two with 20 points from the nine games since he took over. The former Chelsea star is encouraging attacking play from all over his team – when right back Kelvin Maynard got the second goal he became the 15th player to score for the Brewers this season.
