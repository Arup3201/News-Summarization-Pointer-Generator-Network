Tal Ben Haim and Simon Church may drive to Charlton training sessions together but come Saturday they will be on opposing sides in a clash that could define their teams’ Euro 2016 qualifying hopes.

Israel host Wales at Haifa’s Sammy Ofer Stadium in a match between the top two in Group B that Ben Haim promises will be fuelled with national fervour.

The former Bolton, Chelsea and Manchester City defender wears the Israel armband and may be tasked with marking Church, who has led the line for Wales during this qualifying campaign.

‘We’re really good team-mates so it’s going to be a bit strange,’ said Ben Haim. ‘But in the first few minutes that will pass and we’re going to be big enemies. The atmosphere will be like you have never seen in England.

‘Our fans are really passionate. They guaranteed their places three months ago — you can’t get tickets. Everyone is talking about the game. It’s huge for us.’

Around 30,000 supporters will be waiting for Gareth Bale and Co, the vast majority cheering on Israel, who have begun their campaign with three wins from three. Wales are a point behind after two wins and two draws.

Israel captain Ben Haim will have to deal with the threat posed by Belgium winger Eden Hazard on March 31

Israel’s match against Belgium, scheduled for last September, was postponed because of the conflict in Gaza. Wales’s visit, according to Ben Haim, gives cause for positivity. ‘We have all the country behind us,’ he said. 

‘We want to put smiles on people’s faces because they have been through a difficult period, and football is the best way for us, as players, to represent the country. It is the best way to help the people.’

After Bale, Ben Haim is likely to face Eden Hazard when Belgium visit three days later. ‘They are players in prime form and will be very tough opponents,’ said the 32-year-old. ‘But we need to play them as a team, not as individuals.’

Church is also keen to get the better of his club-mate. He said: ‘I’d love to score against Ben Haim, that’ll be an extra incentive!’
