The girlfriend of murdered vampire gigolo Shane Chartres-Abbott, has finally broken her silence and spoken out about her lack of trust in the Justice System.

In an interview with the Herald Sun, Kathleen Price also relived the horrific moments that her partner, a male prostitute from Victoria who was on trial for the rape and mutilation of a client, was gunned down in front of her and their unborn child outside of their home more than a decade ago.

'I don't have any faith in the legal system full stop,' she told the Herald Sun. 'It seems that although you try and do the right thing and you got to trial for something that you're accused of, apparently somebody can say "I'm going to play god now, and I don't believe you have the right to a fair trial, but fair play when it comes to me having right to trial, I want the legal system to do everything it can for me". It's ridiculous.

Kathleen Price, the girlfriend of murdered vampire gigolo Shane Chartres-Abbott (whose body is pictured being photographed at the crime scene), has finally broken her silence and spoken out about her lack of trust in the Justice System

'I want to stamp my feet and throw a tantrum and say this is not the way it's supposed to be.'

Her outburst comes after Mark Adrian Perry, Warren Shea and Evangelos Goussis were this week acquitted in the Victorian Supreme Court of orchestrating the murder.

The decision means that despite a decade-long police investigation, featuring a $1 million reward and an international manhunt, the circumstances surrounding the public execution remain unclear.

Ms Price went on to describe the moment Chartres-Abbott was shot outside of their home while the couple and Ms Price's father were on the way to the fifth day of a trial in which Chartres-Abbott was accused of brutally raping and mutilating a client.

During the trial in 2003, the court heard that he had boasted he was a vampire older than the city of Melbourne before also biting off part of her tongue.

The woman was found unconscious in a Melbourne hotel room, bloodied and beaten, with cuts, burns and bite marks covering her body and a chunk of her tongue missing. A police officer described it as one of the most brutal rapes he had seen.

Ms Price described how the day Chartres-Abbott was killed, she ran inside their Reservoir home to make emergency phone calls and grabbed a tea towel while her partner, 28-years-old at the time, lay outside, bleeding from the gunshot wound to his neck.

Ten years later, Ms Price said it was difficult for their son to grow up amongst the sensationalist news of his father but that she tries not to sugar coat things.

And in his final address to the jury, prosecutor Andrew Tinney SC was at pains to ensure they also saw Mr Chartres-Abbott as a man, not a monster.

'He was no more or less than a man, a normal person in our society,' Mr Tinney said.

'No doubt with his own strengths and weaknesses, his own failings, his own virtues, no doubt with friends and family who loved him.

'He wasn't a vampire gigolo. He was a man. He was a human being.

'He was gunned down in broad daylight at the front of his house, in front of his pregnant girlfriend and her father in a suburban street in our city, not in some seedy or dangerous part of the world, but in Melbourne.

'The people who carried out this crime, whoever they are, were not heroes, they were not doing society a favour," he said.

'They were striking a shameful blow, members of the jury, at the very heart of our system.'

Shane Chartres-Abbott, a male prostitute from Victoria, was on trial for the rape and mutilation of a client when he was killed. The woman's former boyfriend Mark Adrian Perry, 46, (centre) was also cleared of both murder and the alternative charge of manslaughter

The trialâ€™s star witness, a career criminal who cannot be named, admitted to being the trigger man in the murder, and implicated Mr Perry, Mr Shea and Goussis.

Mr Tinney urged the jury to see past his lack of morals to the logical sequence of events the prosecutor presented.

It was ultimately the jury's unwillingness to accept the killer as a truthful witness that resulted in the painstaking investigation falling at the last hurdle.

The killer said he was clad in a balaclava when he raced at Mr Chartres-Abbott and killed him before fleeing to a waiting car on June 4, 2003.

But he claimed he was just the final link in the chain, which began the night Mr Chartres-Abbott allegedly raped his client.

Mr Perry, 46, the woman's former boyfriend, was accused of ordering the hit as revenge.

The prosecutors claimed he sought out his childhood friend, Mr Shea, 42, as a conduit to the killer.

Goussis, 46, was accused of accompanying the killer on the mission and acting as his getaway driver.

The killer claims Shea put the sorry tale of the vampire rape to him over a beer at an inner-Melbourne pub and, appalled, he agreed to carry out the attack on Mr Chartres-Abbott.

'I was told that he made a shocking mess of her, bit hunks out of her ... and left her for dead,' the killer said.

Before delivering his lengthy testimony, the killer wavered, threatening to refuse to give evidence.

When he finally did, he abused defence barristers and made changes to his story.

He also implicated former policemen Peter Lalor and David Waters in the killing, two men not charged.

The killer was ultimately attacked by barristers for Mr Perry, Mr Shea and Goussis as a manipulative conman who could not be trusted.

They always maintained their clients had nothing to do with Mr Chartres-Abbott's demise.

Mr Perry, Mr Shea and Goussis were cleared to cheers from their supporters in court, who also applauded the jurors as they left the room.

The men were found not guilty of murder and the alternative charge of manslaughter.

The verdicts left Mr Perry and Mr Shea free to walk from court.

For Mr Perry, it was his first taste of freedom since July 2013, when police tracked him to a Perth factory where he was working under a false name.

He had vanished in 2007 when he learnt he was being investigated for the killing.

Mr Shea had enjoyed bail since late 2013 and was pictured smiling broadly on his way out of the court building.

For Goussis, it meant avoiding a third conviction for murder.

Already serving a 30-year prison sentence for the murders of gangland figures Lewis Moran and Lewis Caine, he wept and mouthed his thanks to the jury while holding his hand over his heart.

As for the prosecution, it was left to rue the tarnished reputations of the victim and the star witness.
