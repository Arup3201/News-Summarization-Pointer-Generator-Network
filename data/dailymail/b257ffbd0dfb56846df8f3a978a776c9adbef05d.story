Long-ago crime: Robin Hall was jailed after police found a 22-year-old warrant for an $85 court fine

A woman is in jail unable to post bail after a bizarre set of circumstances led authorities to track her down – for a petty crime she committed 22 years ago.

Robin Hall, now a married mother of two who designs jet engines, confessed to stealing a pack of cigarettes from a Florida Wal Mart in 1991.

She was arrested Thursday as she, her husband, and two children disembarked from a Disney Dream cruise ship in Port Canaveral, Florida.

Authorities were waiting for Hall, who owes the state a mere $85 in court costs, which they said she failed to pay at the time of the crime.

Police found her, she said, by checking the ship’s manifest for potential terrorists, and finding that she still had an outstanding warrant. 

‘I take full responsibility for what I did,’ Hall told NBC Connecticut, but added: ‘I do not believe I deserve this.’

According to WESH.com, the mother has straightened her life out since the 1991 arrest, graduating college with a degree in architecture. She now works for Pratt & Whitney, a jet design firm, in Connecticut.

Held: Hall is being held at a Florida jail until she can be transferred to a different jail, where she can finally post bail

The network states that Hall is unable to post bail at the Brevard County jail where she is held because the crime was committed in Orange County, and the distraught mother has to be transferred.

‘I just want it to be all over so I can go home,’ she told NBC Connecticut from her holding cell in Brevard County Jail. 

Because of the holiday weekend, Hall may be held until next Thursday.
