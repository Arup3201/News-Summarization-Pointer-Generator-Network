The boss of the investment banker Sage Kelly who allegedly pressurized his wife to have sex with a potential client settled a $52 MILLION lawsuit with a former girlfriend who claimed that he gave chlamydia and made her infertile.

Court papers detail that Jefferies & Co.’s chairman of investment banking, Ben Lorello was accused of giving his former girlfriend Lori Schlitzkus an STI, reports The New York Post.

A confidential settlement was signed by both sides in September of 1999.

His own past: Sage Kelly's boss Ben Lorello was accused of giving his former girlfriend Lori Schlitzkus an STI which left her infertile and settled a $52 million lawsuit with her in 1999

Former girlfriend: Lori Schlitzkus said Lorello insisted she give up her job and he put her in a penthouse on West 48th street along with a monthly allowance 

Schlitzkus says in the suit filed in New York’s Supreme Court, that she met Lorello at her 'place of employment' in 1995 when he was working at Salomon Smith Barney.

Lori Schlitzkus lived in Weehawken, New Jersey until Lorello got her own place in Manhattan. 

Schlitzkus said Lorello insisted she give up her job and he put her in a penthouse on West 48th street and gave her a monthly allowance.

The New York Post reports that Schlitzkus was diagnosed with Chlamydia in 1996 after having unprotected sex with Lorello who she says claimed he was faithful.

She thought she was merely having frequent Urinary Tract Infections at the time but learned she had an infection that would leave her infertile.

Schlitzkus says she later learned Lorello was cheating on her and that he was 'aware that he was infected with the STI chlamydia, but never informed [her].'

Passed a drug test: Benjamin Lorello passed a mandatory drug test this week and claims that Schlitzkus got chlamydia from someone else and that she admitted to stealing his belongings

In anguish: Schlitzkus said that as a result of getting chlamydia she,' 'will for a long time . . . continue to suffer severe physical and mental anguish'

Sadly, Schlitzkus learned in 1999 that she 'would be unable to conceive children.'

She said that as a result she,' 'will for a long time . . . continue to suffer severe physical and mental anguish.'

Lorello denied the claims, saying in a court response that the STI was 'caused by the negligence of plaintiff and/or third parties.'

He also said that she 'admitted to wrongfully taking property of defendant.'

Sage Kelly’s wife claims that Lorello was one of her husband's 'drug cohorts.'

Lorello passed a mandatory drug test this week as part of the  investigation .

Colleagues of the real-life 'Wolf of Wall Street' who allegedly pressurized his wife to have sex with a potential client have been drug-tested as a result of the investigation.

Sage Kelly, 42, the $7-million-a-year head of healthcare investment banking at Jefferies & Company, is portrayed in court papers filed by wife Christina Di Mauro Kelly as a habitual drug user who was regularly unfaithful and abusive to his children.

Mrs Kelly, 39, who is filing for divorce in Manhattan, sent shock waves across Wall Street by naming a string of high-level bankers and businessmen who she claims her husband took cocaine with on a regular basis.

Lorello's spokesperson said, 'these completely unsubstantiated 15-year-old personal allegations from a woman who later admitted to wrongdoing were unequivocally denied by Mr. Lorello.'
