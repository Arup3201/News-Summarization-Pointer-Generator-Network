He is the man behind one the most iconic album covers in the world.

And now Sir Peter Blake, the pop art expert, has decided to recreate his Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover for the Beatles in a new work urging people to support their local shopkeepers.

The 82-year-old has created a collage called High Street Heroes in the style of the album cover featuring 40 small businesses - including fishmongers, cheese makers and a baker - from across the UK. 

Sir Peter, who worked at a local butcher when he was 13, said it is important to support small independent businesses that give character to a local area and are only able to thrive through hard work.

High Street Heroes has been created by pop artist Sir Peter Blake and resembles the Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover he developed for the Beatles, which is now one of the most famous designs

The cover for the Beatles album has become one of the most iconic and won a Grammy award for its design 

He said: 'I try and use small shops as much as I can. I live in a place where there is a wet fish shop and a couple of delicatessens.

'I buy my art materials from a local small shop.

'Small shops and the Great British shopkeeper have been at the forefront of British culture for hundreds of years now.

'The notion of a 'nation of shopkeepers' is embedded in our folklore and the wonderful variety of today's independent shops as well as the character that small businesses bring to a local area make them an ideal subject matter for modern pop art.

'Having worked at a local butcher at the age of 13, I have also experienced the dedication and hard work that goes into running a small shop.

'I still buy all my art materials from an independently-run art shop. It is for all these reasons that I am thrilled to be lending my support to a campaign that champions small businesses.'

The artist has joined supermodel Daisy Lowe, 25, in urging people to support their local shops, traders and restaurants on December 6 as part of the Small Business Saturday campaign. 

His artwork is modelled on his Sgt Pepper album cover which became one of the most recognised in the world and won a Grammy award for its design in 1967. 

Sir Peter Blake said supporting independent shopkeepers is important and makes communities unique 

Sir Peter unveiled his artwork in advance of the Small Business Saturday event taking place on December 6

It features the Beatles surrounded by celebrities including Edgar Allan Poe, Fred Astaire and Bob Dylan. An adaptation of his work, featuring the faces of music executives in place of the Beatles was valued at £70,000. It was created in December 1967 to celebrate the success of the album.

Sir Peter, of Chiswick, west London, said of his design: 'It is a form I use quite often, the idea of a crowd.

'What I wanted in this case was very formal photos of people just standing absolutely still looking at the camera and holding something which indicates what their trade or shop is.'

Husband and wife Merlin Jones, 28, and Genevieve Schiffenhaus, 29, who run independent deli 'General Store' in Peckham Rye, south London feature in the top right corner of the collage.

They quit their careers in 2011 and toured the country learning how to make cheeses and bake bread before opening their shop last year.

The adapted artwork for the Beatles album cover saw it become the most valuable in the world 

The shop's wares include locally sourced bread from Brixton, Peckham-grown redcurrants, handmade jams from Hackney and coffee roasted in Clerkenwell.

Mrs Jones said: 'Merlin and I both knew that food was where our interest lay, so we decided to take the leap three years ago.

'We left London and visited firms in Somerset, Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire, Wales and Scotland to learn how to make cheese and bake bread.

'That now informs our running of the shop as we know about the production processes and all the skill and hard work that goes into them.

'Since we are a small shop, we have personally selected every item in here and would recommend and stand by every one of them.

Babette Kulik, 47, who sources rare first edition books and stages candlelit evening readings and poetry events at her bookshop The Society Club in London's Soho features on the collage.

Also appearing are Cardiff fishmonger Nick Bryant, 36, who takes delivery of the catch of local fishermen at 3am, and Bath boutique owners Olivia Brewer and Nik Blake, both 32.

Small Business Saturday is organised by American Express which found the event boosted the turnover of small businesses by £468 million last year. It was originally run in America and Chuka Umunna, the business secretary, asked the company to bring the event to British shores. 

Model Daisy Lowe is one of the celebrity supporters of the campaign. She said:  'I'm passionate about small, independent shops and have picked up some of my most treasured outfits from one-of-a-kind boutiques.

'One of my favourite discoveries in small business is an amazing shop in Somerset near where my mum lives. I always find amazing 1930s dresses.'
