A rare white buffalo revered by Native Americans that was found dead in 
Texas died from a bacterial infection and wasn't killed and mutilated, 
as its owner suspected.

Hunt County Sheriff Randy Meeks said a veterinarian made the 
determination and that photographs indicate the calf wasn't skinned. He said the investigation is closed unless new evidence surfaces.

The calf, named Lightning Medicine Cloud, died in May on the Lakota Ranch near Greenville, about 50 miles northeast of Dallas.

Sacred: Lightning Medicine Cloud was revered by Native Americans

Fatal infection: The rare animal was killed by bacteria and not mutilated and skinned as originally feared

Ranch owner Arby Little Soldier 
reported finding the calf skinned and believed it had been killed as 
part of a hate crime. He didn't return a message seeking comment 
Tuesday.

Meeks said Little Soldier had not been notified about the results of the investigation as of Tuesday afternoon.

As a non-albino white buffalo, the 
calf was revered by Native Americans. According to Lakota Sioux lore, 
the goddess of peace once appeared in the form of a white buffalo calf.

The buffalo's death sparked 
international attention, Little Soldier has said, and one Oregon 
organization planned to donate a white buffalo bull from its herd.

Meeks said the sheriff's office was not notified of Lightning Medicine Cloud's death until six days after the animal died.

It had been buried for three days because Little Soldier 'wanted to talk to his elders before he contacted us,' Meeks said.

Meeks said the investigation revealed
two more buffalo have died at the Lakota Ranch since May. He said 
investigators believe blackleg, a bacterial infection, was responsible 
for all of the deaths.

'It lays dormant in the land,' Meeks said of the spores that cause the infection. 'It's very preventable by vaccination. We were not told by the Little Soldiers that these two had died.'

Non-suspicious: Authorities have declared their investigation overÂ 

Terry Hensley, a Texas A&M 
extension office veterinarian, said a blackleg vaccine is available for 
cattle but has not been approved for buffalo.

Some experts say the cattle vaccine has been effective in buffalo, Hensley said.

Animals eat the spores, or the spores
enter the body through a wound. The spores, a small number of which are
usually found in an animal's digestive tract, can lay dormant inside 
the animal's muscles, and break out months or years later.

The bacteria become activated by quick growth or muscle exertion.

'Normally they're healthy one day and the rancher finds them dead the next,' Hensley said.

Lightning Medicine Cloud's mother Buffalo Woman was found dead a day after the white buffalo's death.

Little Soldier has said he believes she was poisoned. Meeks said he could not comment on the mother's death.

Little Soldier had offered a $45,000 reward for information about the animal's death.
Meeks said no charges will be filed against Little Soldier.
