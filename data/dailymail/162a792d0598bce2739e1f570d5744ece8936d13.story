Germany 20-1 England...and it's going to get worse.

England's early World Cup elimination has guaranteed one of football’s most remarkable statistics will continue.

In the last 23 World Cups and European Championships since 1968 including the current tournament in Brazil, England have progressed further than Germany just once.

While Roy Hodgson's men have bombed, Germany go into Saturday's match against Ghana on the back of a thumping 4-0 victory against Portugal. It was ever thus.

The 1970 World Cup quarter-final in Mexico – when West Germany came from behind to win 3-2 – represented a shift in power between the nations that has lasted until this day.

Since then, Germany have reached 11 major World Cup and European finals – England none.

The only tournament where England were better than their rivals was Euro 2004 when Sven Goran Eriksson’s side reached the last eight and Germany failed to get out of their group.

In Euro 2000, both teams failed to progress from their groups - but on the other 20 occasions, Germany have gone further. If they qualify - as looks certain - from their group, it will be 21-1 to the Germans.

Quite remarkable, as David Coleman used to say.
