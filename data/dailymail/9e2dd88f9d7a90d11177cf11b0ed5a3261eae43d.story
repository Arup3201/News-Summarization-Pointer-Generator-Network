A convicted serial killer dubbed the 'Serial Shooter' - who would gun down pedestrians, cyclists and animals in random late night drive-by shootings in Phoenix, killing six people - was likely hoarding antidepressants from a fellow inmate in the months before committing suicide, a state prison investigation said.

Findings in an Arizona Department of Corrections report released Friday indicate another inmate gave 40-year-old Dale Hausner several amitriptyline pills a week over a two-month period at a Florence prison.

According to the documents, the unidentified inmate told the Inspector General's Office that Hausner said he was having trouble sleeping.

The inmate initially gave Hausner nine pills, before then giving out four or five each week.

Final act: Convicted serial killer Dale Hausner committed suicide in June 2013 by overdosing on 
antidepressants. An investigation has found he had hoarded as many as 56 pills from a fellow inmate in a nearby cell over the course of two months using a homemade fishing line

Death on Death Row: Hausner was found unresponsive in his cell at the Eyman state prison complex in Florence on June 19, 2013. He had been found guilty in a series of random shootings on pedestrians, bicyclists and animals that terrorized the Phoenix area in 2005 and 2006

The inmate told officials he had medications to give because prison nurses didn't always watch him take what was a daily dosage.

He would save any he didn't feel like taking.

While the inmate recalled talking with Hausner about the idea of stockpiling pills to commit suicide, the inmate said he thought Hausner was taking them as he received them.

According to the inmate, he would use a homemade fishing line to transport pills from his cell to another until they reached Hausner.

It's possible Hausner had more than 56 tablets, the inmate said.

He was found unresponsive in his isolation cell at Eyman state prison complex on June 19, 2013.

He was pronounced dead about an hour later at a hospital in Anthem, according to Arizona Department of Corrections officials.

Silent killer: Hausner's cause of death was 
'amitriptyline intoxication.' Amitriptyline is one of a variety of 
antidepressant medications sold under the brand name Elavil

The Pinal County Medical Examiner's Office ruled his death a suicide and said the cause of death was 'amitriptyline intoxication'.

Hausner was found guilty in a series of random shootings on pedestrians, bicyclists and animals.

The former airport janitor was given six death sentences and hundreds of years in prison for killing six people and attacking 19 others in 2005 and 2006.

Hausner was arrested in August 2006 with his roommate, Sam Dieteman, at the apartment they shared in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa.

Inside, police found guns, news clippings of the killings and a city map marked with the locations of some of the shootings.

2006 with his roommate, Sam Dieteman (right), who pleaded guilty in two 
of the killings and was sentenced to life in prison. Police were tipped off by one of Dieteman's drinking buddies, who told them he had been bragging about the killings

Death wish: Since his convictions, Hausner had 
waived his appeals and asked in a letter to the court 'to be executed as
 soon as possible', saying it would be best for the families of his victims

Dieteman, who pleaded guilty in two of the killings and was sentenced to life in prison, testified against Hausner, saying they cruised around late at night looking for strangers to shoot.

The 'serial shooter' attacks and an unrelated serial killer case terrorized the community and kept neighborhood watch groups on high alert in the summer of 2006.

Last victim: Hausner shot dead Robin Blasnek, 22, in Mesa, Arizona, on July 30, 2006, marking the end of his bloody rampage

Families stayed inside and authorities called meetings that drew hundreds of people.

Since his convictions, Hausner had asked 'to be executed as quickly as possible'.

County authorities have said that while he was awaiting trial, Hausner tried to kill himself with an overdose of cold tablets.

Police were finally able to track down Hausner following the 14-month shooting spree after one of Dieteman's drinking buddies reported him to authorities, saying Dieteman had been bragging about shooting people.

On March 13, 2009, Hausner was convicted of 80 crimes, including six counts of first-degree murder, attempted murder, aggravated assault, cruelty to animals and other charges, according to the station AZ Family.

He was found guilty of murdering David Estrada, Nathaniel Shoffner, Jose Ortis, Marco Carillo, Claudia Gutierrez-Cruz, and Robin Blasnek.

Even though Hausner had denied any involvement, he took an odd turn during the penalty phase of his trial when he apologized to the families of every victim.

Dale Hausner's brother Randy said of his death: 'It's a shame it happened this way rather than the victims getting a final say at his execution, but either way, it's over.’

Following Hausner's death, his most recent lawyer, Garrett Simpson, said: 'I have rarely met a person who had a more miserable life.

'He was a very wounded soul, and I am really sorry his life worked out like that, and that's taking nothing from the appalling losses that were afflicted.’
