Scarred: Helena was shocked after her NHS tummy tuck left her midriff badly deformed and her looking like a man

Helena Grace could barely believe her luck when she was told she could have a tummy tuck on the NHS.

After losing nine stone in just a year, thanks to a gastric bypass (also on the NHS), the 36-year-old nanny from Chesham, Bucks, had been left with large amounts of unsightly loose skin around her abdomen.

Helena, who was once 21st 8lb, hoped the procedure – called an apronectomy or mini tummy tuck – would restore her self-confidence. Instead, the operation left her deformed, revolted and despairing every time she looked at her body.

‘I was so happy to finally lose weight but I was left with a lot of excess skin and it was making me miserable. So, at my yearly check-up, I asked my surgeon if anything could be done to correct it. He said he would refer me for a tummy tuck, which would get rid of the loose skin. I was really pleased when he said I could get the operation on the NHS.

‘I was referred to the Royal Free Hospital in North London and had an appointment with plastic surgeon Norbert Kang. He spent five minutes talking to me about the operation and left the rest up to his registrar [a junior doctor].

‘Mr Kang did manage to tell me about possible risks of the surgery. He said that I would lose my belly button but it was only another scar and that I’d already have a huge scar across my stomach anyway,’ says Helena, who lives with fiance Tim, 44, a painter and decorator.

‘I didn’t like the thought of not having a belly button. It’s something that you have from birth and very much a part of you – not just another scar.

‘But when a surgeon tells you that it’s a normal part of the operation, you put your trust in him. I went along with it because I didn’t know any better.

‘He also said that I may have flaps of skin at each hip, which he called “excessive dog ears”. I assumed that this too was normal and so I consented to the surgery. I had no idea it would turn out the way it did.’

Nothing he said prepared Helena for the horrific results of the operation in February 2009. ‘When I came round, Mr Kang told me that he’d removed nearly 7lb of excess skin and was pleased with the result.

‘When I took the bandages off, I didn’t know what to expect.

‘I had never seen the results of a tummy tuck before, so if anything, I was pleased that so much skin had been removed. I had a horizontal scar from hip to hip that measured over 12 inches long and cut straight across the middle of my stomach.

‘I had, as predicted, no belly button and large flaps of skin that hung over my hips. I also had a thick pouch of skin that sagged from the centre of my stomach over my pubic bone so, to put it delicately, I looked like a man. It was very embarrassing.’

Yet Mr Kang assured her that the state her body was left in was perfectly normal.

Helena was devastated. ‘People even asked me if I was going through a sex change because you could see a bulge through my clothes. I started to refuse invitations to go out – I hated the thought that people could see what a bad shape I was. My boyfriend at the time never mentioned it.

‘He knew how upset I was and was aware that it was not something he should talk about.’

After two years of suffering in silence, Helena decided to investigate corrective surgery – specifically tackling the pouch of flesh above her groin.

‘Mr Kang told me that he didn’t do that kind of operation. He said it would have to be done privately – and suggested the name of a surgeon, but after everything that had happened I decided I’d find my own doctor.’

She settled on cosmetic surgeon Mario Russo, who admits he was horrified by Helena’s post-operative body.

‘In all the years I’ve been practising I’ve never seen an abdomen like hers,’ he says. ‘The scar that should have been near her bikini line was high up above where her navel should be. The fact she had no belly button at all really shocked me.

‘Of course there is always a risk with this kind of surgery that you can lose a portion of the navel, but it was not acceptable that she’d been left in that state and I was really angry on her behalf.’

The corrective surgery by Mr Russo would normally have cost £15,000 – an amount Helena says she couldn’t afford. Instead, Mr Russo offered her the chance to appear in a television series that he was taking part in, which would mean she could have the surgery for free.

‘I was nervous but I didn’t feel like I had many other options,’ she says. ‘I felt so upset that the NHS surgeon seemed unconcerned by the cosmetic results of the operation. I was shocked by what Mr Russo had said but it was also something of a relief to have him confirm what I knew in my heart – that the way I looked wasn’t normal at all. I was absolutely gutted that I had been led to believe it was all OK.’

Helena underwent the five-hour corrective operation in June this year. Mr Russo says: ‘The previous procedure seemed to be very badly planned. When you perform surgery, you’re always taught that before you cut, you have to consider how you are going to close the wound. In Helena’s case, it seemed that the surgeon had cut without thinking it through.’

Mr Kang is a consultant plastic surgeon and honorary senior lecturer at University College, London. His research interests are listed as hand surgery and prosthetic reconstruction.

It is NHS policy not to allow individual surgeons to speak to the media about specific cases. However, the Royal Free Hospitals NHS Trust gave a statement saying: ‘We are sorry to learn that Ms Grace was unhappy with the results of her operation although she has not made a formal complaint.

‘She was advised that it might not be possible to preserve her navel and it was also emphasised that following surgery, she might be unhappy with the cosmetic appearance of her abdomen.

‘Ms Grace signed a consent form indicating that she understood this information and wished to proceed. Following substantial weight loss, people may be left with excess folds of skin in the abdominal area, which can cause skin infections.

‘In order to alleviate these problems, NHS patients may be offered an apronectomy. In contrast, an abdominoplasty operation is a cosmetic surgery procedure where the aim of the operation is to improve the aesthetic appearance of the abdomen, and this includes preserving the navel. The NHS does not routinely offer this operation.’

Helena simply says: ‘I didn’t have skin infections. I believed the operation would make me look better. Would he have left his wife or daughter in that state?’

There has been a huge rise in  post-obesity surgery in the past decade, linked to the increasing numbers of patients undergoing gastric banding and bypass – about 14,000 of these operations were carried out last year. As the number of operations rises, so does the number of complaints.

‘Complaints are usually due to poor outcomes,’ says Victoria Hydon, an expert in medical negligence at Moore Blatch Resolve solicitors.  ‘We have about 50 similar cases a year – split equally between the NHS and private sector – and usually the problem lies with a breakdown in communication with patient and surgeon.’

Meanwhile, Helena simply wants to get on with her life.

‘I wish that I’d never had the tummy tuck in the first place.’
