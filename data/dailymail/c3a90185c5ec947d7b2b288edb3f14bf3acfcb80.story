Former President George W. Bush has undergone knee replacement surgery and is said to be recovering successfully.

The 67-year-old was treated at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago on Saturday and has since returned to his home state of Texas.

'It was an outpatient procedure and he was able to walk up and down a flight of stairs just a couple hours after the surgery,' the former president's spokesman Freddy Ford told Politico.

Road to recovery: Former Preisdent George W. Bush has undergone a partial knee replacement and the trouble arose in spite of his active retirement lifestyle (which includes bike races, like this one on May 2)

Leading the charge: Former President Bush participated in the Wounded Warrior 100k bike race near his ranch in Crawford, Texas in early May, just weeks before his surgery this weekend

'He came back to Dallas yesterday where he is recovering quickly at home.'

The surgery was technically a partial knee replacement though it has not been announced which knee was the focus of the operation.

This is not the first indication that the 43rd president has had trouble with his knee.

Health: Bush, 67, had a stent operation in August

He had a case of 'runner's knee' in 2003 that resulted in an incomplete meniscus tear in his right knee but that was ruled as insignificant at the time.

'As you get above the age of 40, you 
see meniscus tears on M.R.I.'s in people who have no symptoms at all and
 say their knees are perfect,' Dr Kevin Freedman, the director of sports
 medicine at Loyola University's Medical Center in Chicago told The New York Times when the tear was noted.

Though
 Bush has kept a relatively low political profile since leaving office 
in 2008, he has continued to stay physically active.

Earlier
 this month, he reprised his role as the leader of the annual Wounded 
Warrior 100k bike race near his ranch in Crawford, Texas.

That was his first significant public race since having a stent put in his heart last August to clear a blocked artery.

Ahead of the Wounded Warrior ride, which is made up largely of injured veterans, he said that he exerted 'executive privilege' by selecting the route to avoid some of the really tough trails'.

'This is not a race. This is a festival... so please don't pass me,' he joked, according to The Dallas Morning News.
