Nicola de Menezes has described how her husband was shot dead and she let her daughter, Eva, hug him one last time

A British woman on holiday in South Africa has described how her husband was shot dead by intruders in the middle of the night – and how she let their seven-year-old daughter hug his still-warm body for the last time and say goodbye.

Little Eva de Menezes kissed her father Clinton and told him: ‘Goodbye Daddy. Sleep tight.’Nicola de Menezes told The Mail on Sunday how she made the heartbreaking decision to let her daughter see and touch him, and how she is sure she will never regret it.

‘We are a family who lived for each other and loved each other, and we needed to be together even at that terrible moment,’ she said.

Renowned artist Clinton, 43, was at 
the height of his career with exhibitions in London and New York when he
 was shot as he tried to help a friend fend off an armed gang.

The
 family, who until recently lived in Hanwell, West London,  were on 
holiday to celebrate their wedding anniversary and the New Year.

Nicola’s parents, Tony and Brenda Saward, had emigrated to South Africa 
in 1967 and she grew up in the country. Clinton was her sweetheart at 
secondary school.

The couple were staying with their closest friends, Amanda and Simon Malpas, in a quiet suburb of Durban when two armed men – now believed to be part of a gang who had earlier carried out two other robberies in the city and shot another man – appeared on the raised deck outside the sitting-room and burst through the patio doors.

Nicola, 45, said she had since relived that horrifying moment  ‘a hundred times’.

She said the tragedy happened when their lives had seemed  at their absolute best. She had recently started a job as an oil company executive in Kenya and her husband and child came with her from England. Clinton had commissions for several major artworks.

‘We had been talking about how wonderful everything had turned out for us,’ she said.

‘Life could not have been better. Then it all ended in a flash. I feel robbed of everything. Only my family and friends are keeping me going now.’

She described how she had  taken Eva to bed earlier that night and dozed off herself, leaving Clinton and her friends talking and listening to music in the next room. She was then woken by a violent commotion.

‘It was about 1am,’ she recalled. ‘I heard the crashing of doors and shouting and screaming. Our friend Simon was yelling and I could hear strangers’ voices.

‘Clinton was in the bathroom and Amanda was pounding on the door for him to let her in. I picked up Eva and got to the bathroom as quickly as I could.

‘I put her into the laundry basket and told her to stay there, that everything would be all right. It was just instinctive – I didn’t want her to see or hear anything bad.

‘Clinton said he was going to help. There was no stopping him and I didn’t even try. His friend was being attacked and Clinton would never stand by and let that happen.’ Mr Malpas had been trying to close the patio doors against the two intruders but they forced their way in.

As Clinton hurried into the sitting-room he came face-to-face with one of the burglars brandishing a gun. He was shot through the heart and died instantly. It all happened in a split-second, Nicola said.

She knew her husband was dead before she even rushed out of the bathroom. ‘I had been shaking with fear, with Amanda and I clinging to each other, when we heard the shot.

‘We just prayed, “Please God, let our boys be OK,” but then I heard a sound, one loud groan that was also  a sigh, and I just knew it was Clinton’s last breath.

‘I got down beside him on the floor and held him. I talked to him and sobbed my heart out. I just talked to him quietly for about five minutes, waiting for the police to arrive. I thanked him for being a wonderful father and husband to us and told him that I loved him.

‘He was still warm, lying there, and I decided to let Eva see him – he meant everything to her. He looked peaceful and she came straight over and lay down next to him. She kept asking me why his eyes were open  so I closed them gently and then she kissed him and told him to sleep tight.’ Nicola also asked Amanda to get Clinton’s wedding ring for her before his body was removed from the scene.

‘I want to keep it with me always,’ she said. She made the same decision about her husband’s ashes after his cremation. ‘We are not scattering his ashes anywhere. I’ll keep them for the rest of my life.’

Nicola has no bitterness, she said, just deep pity for the victims of  violent crime in a country she once loved. ‘This is the loveliest place  in the world but people are now trapped, fearful in their own homes, and I feel sorry for them.

‘Clinton and I came here on holiday each year. It’s where his career started, he got his fine art degree at the city’s Institute of Technology. He always hoped after its cruel history it would become a better place.’

South Africa suffers some of the highest crime statistics in the world, with an average of 46 murders every day.

Nicola said she and her husband had been reluctant to leave the country in 2007, but he wanted to achieve a wider market for his art.

Clinton quickly gained recognition, exhibiting works at the Bicha Gallery in London. He sent a huge piece of art on long-term loan to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and his giant World Map is at the London headquarters of auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers.

He also began to teach his daughter 
painting and sculpting techniques. ‘Clinton adored her, and  they did 
everything together,’ she said. ‘I would be at work and he did the 
childcare during the day. ‘They played together, worked in the studio together, and he took her to school and fetched her home.’

Two
 days after his death, Eva wanted to know when her father  would be 
back.

Nicola said: ‘We told her Daddy wasn’t coming back. We wanted her 
to know the truth.

‘She was very upset and asked who would be taking her to school now he was gone.

‘I’m only managing to keep my belief in humanity through friends and family. Without them I would  be in despair. We knew about rising crime here but I didn’t know it could be so sinister and uncaring.’

She described how the intruders took two handbags belonging to her and Amanda.

The property was later recovered by police, and four men have appeared at a magistrates court nearby. Two are accused of murder and burglary, another of being an accessory, and the fourth, a Congolese national, is accused of receiving stolen goods.

‘Nobody gained a thing from  this,’ Nicola said. ‘And our lives  are ruined.’
