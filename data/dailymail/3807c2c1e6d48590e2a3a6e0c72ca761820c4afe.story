The elderly widow of a World War II spy who spent six months hiding in a loft from the Nazis ended her own life by taking poison, an inquest heard.

Noreen Orange, 85, killed herself four years after the death of her husband John, who worked for British intelligence and spoke fluent German.

Neighbours knew very little about the secretive couple who had lived together in Budleigh Salterton, east Devon, for 60 years.

But the inquest heard Mr Orange was a spy who joined the army after being forced to abandon his Cambridge University medicine degree after the war broke out in 1939.

He went to Sandhurst before later working on the 'intelligence side', the coroner in Exeter, Devon was told.

Friends said they believed Mr Orange had been ‘spying in the war for the Russians’ - although the family said they were mistaken and he worked for the British secret service.

The retired spy had told neighbours that he was in Austria during the war when he hid from the Germans in a loft.

He was shot in the left arm during the war and also in his calf but 'never discussed it', the coroner was told.

It is unclear exactly what Mr Orange did in the military because he never discussed it, his niece Sarah Richards added.

The family don't know whether he still worked for British intelligence after the war.

'John was a very very private person.
 He did not talk about what he got up to. I am sure he was not a spy for
 the Russians because he was definitely a patriot.

'He was involved in British intelligence.'

She added that he always wore a shirt and waistcoat because they covered the wound on his arm.

He later worked in the clock-making business repairing expensive timepieces for Christies and Sothebys.

The coroner was told she ended her own life last February, four years after her husband had passed away.

The emergency services were called to a chemical incident at her house last February.

They had to wear special chemical suits and breathing gear to enter the property because of the poisonous fumes.

No post-mortem examination was carried out on her body because of the chemicals.

Mrs Orange, who worked as a journalist and never had any children, left a suicide note written several days before her death.

Mrs Richards said her uncle John had been a 'possessive and needy' man.

She added that her aunt had threatened to end her own life if she ever got a terminal illness.

'She was a very intelligent lady who would think about things very carefully and her decision would not have been taken lightly,' Mrs Richards said.

The inquest heard Mrs Orange was suffering with back pain and sciatica in the days before she killed herself and had told friends that she would not see another spring.

Chris Sampson, who had known the pensioner for 43 years, said she was a ‘proud and independent’ woman who had been in a lot of pain in the final weeks of her life.

She said to him 'thank you for everything you have done for me’ hours before she ended her life.

PC David Evans said the handwritten suicide note found at the scene was written two days before Mrs Orange killed herself.

Coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland concluded that Mrs Orange had ended her own life with cyanide some time after 3pm on February 1 last year.

'John was absolutely devoted to Noreen and he was possessive because he found it difficult to socialise. He taught her German and they enjoyed socialising together,' she said.
