Pope Francis has today come out against the legalisation of drugs such as cannabis, saying attempts to sell it for recreational use are 'highly questionable'.

Francis told members of a drug conference in Rome that attempts to legalise recreational drugs 'are not only highly questionable from a legislative standpoint, but fail to produce the desired effects.'

The news comes as it was revealed the pontiff threw out asylum seekers seeking refuge in his favuorite church while he visited, forcing them to sit in the car park and refusing to meet with them.

The Pope spoke out against allowing drugs to be given to addicts, saying 'Let me state this in the clearest terms possible. The problem of drug use is not solved with drugs!'

The Pope previously said that the Church must be the ‘first port of call’ for migrants arriving on Europe’s shores, but refused the meeting in case it is seen 'as a political gesture'.

Francis has also spoken out against drug addiction, calling it evil, and has often met with addicts. When he was archbishop of 
Buenos Aires, he devoted much of his pastoral care to addicts.

Francis added that providing addicts with drugs offered only 'a veiled means of surrendering to the phenomenon.'

He said: 'Let me state this in the clearest terms possible. The problem of drug use is not solved with drugs.

'One has to say yes to life, yes to love, yes to others, yes to education, yes to greater job opportunities.

'If we say yes to all these things, there will be no room for illicit drugs, for alcohol abuse, for other forms of addiction.'

Just
 last month, Uruguay - next door to Francis' native Argentina - approved
 selling marijuana cigarettes in pharmacies, and recreational marijuana 
is legal in the U.S. states of Colorado and Washington.

It was also revealed today that before his visit to Malta (pictured), the Pope had around 120 refugees seeking asylum in his favourite church thrown out so he could visit

In Colorado, cannabis has already been linked to a string of poisonings in children after they ate cookies or sweets laced with cannabis that are identical to non-cannabis varieties.

Of the nine children who have so far been treated for eating edible marijuana, six became critically ill, with the youngest being just two.

Francis refused to meet with around 120 people, mostly migrants from North Africa and Eastern Europe, who took refuge in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore two weeks ago.

Having been evicted by Italian authorities from a squat outside Rome the fifty families asked Francis to grant them asylum in the Vatican.

In a letter to the Pope they said: 'We ask that you make yours the wounds that we carry, that you grant us as human beings who have been persecuted, harassed and humiliated by the Italian state, political asylum.'

But Francis, who went to pray at the Marian Basilica on his very first day in office, and often seeks advice there before making journeys abroad, had the church cleared yesterday before his visit.

As he arrived in a procession to celebrate the Corpus Christi the migrants were relegated to the car park by Vatican Gendarmerie.

‘We couldn’t even see the Pope. We were moved to the car park and he came in the back entrance,’ one migrant Rashid Belbiar from Morocco said.

Vatican spokesman Father Thomas Rosica said beforehand that the Holy See feared such a meeting might be ‘manipulated to put pressure on the Rome authorities’.

Francis refused to meet with the refugees, despite their pleas, over fears it would be seen as a 'political gesture'. Francis often visits the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore before travelling to ask for guidance

One woman identified only as Magdalina, told La Repubblica the migrants were 'shocked' at their treatment.

She said: 'We were counting on being able to meet Pope Francis. We asked him to hear us out, even just for a few minutes.

'But they told us that we could not meet him and must go away from the church. They told us that if he met us it would be a political gesture.'

Francis was their 'last chance of salvation', she said. The group must leave the Basilica today.

While the Italian authorities have offered the group temporary accommodation in a former exhibition hall they had previously refused because other inhabitants have been diagnosed with tuberculosis.

Tomorrow while on a visit to the southern Calabria region in Italy, Francis will visit the stronghold of one of the world's most powerful Mafia families.

The Pope is due to travel to the town of Cassano Jonico, home of the 'Ndrangheta, a criminal organisation that allegedly has a turnover of $72billion per year.

The crime syndicate is so well established that it even has routes into the local churches, according to prosecutors in the region.

Francis became emotional when denouncing the killing of Nicola 'Coco' Campolongo in January.

The three-year-old boy was shot dead alongside his grandfather and another woman in an alleged hit by Calabria's Mafia, with Francis calling on gangsters to 'repent'.
