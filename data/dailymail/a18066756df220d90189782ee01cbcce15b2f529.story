Tom Brady firmly denied having any part in Deflategate or altering balls in a press conference.

'When I pick those footballs out, at that point, to me, they're perfect,' he said. 

'I don't want anyone touching my balls after that. I don't want anyone rubbing them, you know, putting any air in them, taking any air out. To me, those balls are perfect and that's what I expect when I show up on the field.'

And while he said he did not know of anyone on his team lowering the pressure in any of the game balls, he said while he could not deny that anything happened as he was busy preparing for the game and did not see everything that went on, he talked to the team's equipment staff who said they did not adjust the pressure in the balls. 

'They also know how I like the balls and I tell them how great they are,' he said of the staff.

Tom Brady firmly denied having any involvement in Deflategate during a press conference

Bill Belichick  addressed the media  in reference to the recent Deflategate scandal that is plaguing the Patriots

'I feel like I have always played within the rules. I would never break the rules,' Brady told the press

Meanwhile, teammates who spoke with NBC News said he told members of the New England Patriots in a closed door meeting earlier in the day that he liked his balls 'a certain way.' 

'I feel like I have always played within the rules. I would never break the rules,' Brady told the press.

'I was as surprised as anybody when I heard Monday morning what was happening.' 

Brady also made it very clear that he believes the Patriots won 'fair and square' in their 45 - 7 rout of the Indianapolis Colts last Sunday in the AFC Championship game.

Brady also stressed this was not as serious as everyone has been making it out to be these past few days, noting; 'This isn't ISIS, no one's dying, we'll get through this.'

The NFL seems to feel the same way too, with Brady revealing investigators have not even reached out to him. 

Some members of the press were shocked however when Brady said he would not even be able to notice the difference in ball pressure while playing as he is only focused on the game.

'Everybody has a preference. Some guys like them round. Some guys like them thin. Some guys like them tacky. Some guys like them brand new. Some guys like old balls,' he explained.

He also says he checks the leather, laces and tack of the ball before games, but never squeezes them. 

'I think there’s a lot of people who have more information than me,' said the two-time Super Bowl MVP. 

'I have questions, too.' 

He later said; 'The integrity of the sport is very important.' 

Brady hinted at his possible involvement in Deflategate as he told members of the New England Patriots in a closed door meeting that he liked his balls 'a certain way'

Meanwhile, the eternally gruff and forever short Belichick addressed the media Thursday morning and kept it simple, saying he was 'shocked' to learn that 11 of his team's 12 balls were underinflated and that he never even touches game balls, let alone knows anything about 'football air pressure.'

Belichick had told the media they should address comments they have about the footballs to Brady. 

'I think we all know that quarterbacks, kickers, specialists have certain preferences on footballs. They know a lot more about it than I do. They're a lot more sensitive to it than I am,' he explained.

'I hear them comment on it from time to time, but I can tell you and they will tell you that there is never any sympathy whatsoever from me on that subject. Zero. Tom's personal preferences on his footballs is something he can talk about in much better detail and information than I can possibly provide.' 

He then added; 'In my entire coaching career, I have never talked to any player or staff member about football air pressure,' said Belichick.

He also said he would be sure to keep the balls on the higher end of the inflation scale moving forward to make sure this does not happen again.

'Obviously, with our footballs being inflated to the 12.5-pound range, any deflation would then take us under that specification limit,' he said.

'Knowing that now, in the future, we will certainly inflate the footballs above that low level to account for any possible change during the game.' 

The conference ended, in typical Belichick style, with the coaching great giving the same response to every question asked by the press; 'I've told you everything I know.'

If, for any reason, anyone on the Patriots is found to have anything to do with Sunday's under-inflated balls, they would face up to a $25,000 fine

This as Brady and Belichick prepare to face the Seattle Seahawks on February 1 in their record sixth Super Bowl appearance. 

The Seahawks, the reigning Super Bowl champions, have remained somewhat quiet about the recent controversy, though the team's cornerback Richard Sherman did say of Brady while speaking to the press on Wednesday; 'I think people somehow get a skewed view of Tom Brady that he is just a clean-cut does everything right and never says a bad word to anyone - and we know him to be otherwise.' 

Also making comments about brady was Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, who was far more complimentary than his teammate. 

'He’s the greatest quarterback to ever play the game, one of the greatest at least,' said Wilson.

'I just think that he’s as good as it gets and watching him play the game of football is truly spectacular.' 

'I think people somehow get a skewed view of Tom Brady that he is just a clean-cut does everything right and never says a bad word to anyone - and we know him to be otherwise,' said Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman (above with Brady after a 2012 game)

If, for any reason, anyone on the Patriots is found to have anything to do with Sunday's underinflated balls, they would face up to a $25,000 fine.

As for Belichick, the incident has many referencing his previous discipline from the league in 2007 when it was discovered that he had sent someone to record the defensive signals used by the New York Jets. 

It is worth nothing however, that while 11 of 12 balls were underinflated by two pounds, they were adjusted at halftime when the score was 17 - 7 in favor of the Patriots.

With the balls in the acceptable range in the second half, the Patriots outscored the Colts 28 - 0 meaning that should anyone on the Patriots have been involved this would have ultimately proven to be a high risk situation with a very, very low reward.

Then, there is what Martin Schmaltz, a Professor of Physics at Boston University, had to tell Boston.com about the possibility no one did anything to the balls and it was just simple physics. 

'If they had inflated the balls inside the building and put it to the minimum amount, and then brought it outside to temperatures that were about 30 degrees lower, that would drop the PSI by between 1 and 2,' Schmaltz explained.
