A three-time liver transplant recipient is finally healthy enough to realise her dream of modelling as she has reached the Miss England regional finals.

Kate Trevener, from Castle Bromwich in the West Midlands, will be taking to the stage to compete in the final of Miss Birmingham on Sunday.

The brave 20-year-old has overcome more than any other contestant at the beauty contest, enduring three liver transplants.

If Kate is crowned Miss Birmingham on Sunday, she says she will use it as an opportunity to raise awareness about the importance of donating your organs

Kate, aged 16, before her liver problems began. She is now feeling better than ever after her three liver transplants and is hoping to impress the judges at this weekend's Miss Birmingham finals

Kate was rushed to hospital in October 
2010 after she collapsed at home. Despite never having drunk alcohol, 
she was told she had the liver of a chronic alcoholic and would die 
without a transplant.

And if that was not enough, the private Cessna plane carrying the first donated organ from Northern Ireland crashed in thick fog at Birmingham Airport in November 2010.

Amazingly, rescue workers found the organ in 'pristine' condition packed inside the charred red ice box.

Kate was hours from death at the time but her life was saved by fireman Nick Jordan who freed the pilot from the smouldering cockpit before returning for the organ.

The container was strapped to a motorbike and police closed major roads during rush hour as it was raced to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.

And just 45 minutes after the plane crashed, the liver was successfully transplanted into Kate.

Kate will take to the catwalk in front of judges at The Crescent Theatre, Birmingham, with one thought in mind.

Kate's first liver transplant made headlines in 2010 after the plane carrying her new liver crashed. Amazingly the liver survived the crash and was transplanted into the hopeful model 45 minutes later

Kate was desperately ill before she received her third liver transplant last year. Her body had rejected two other livers but now she is feeling well enough to pursue a career in modelling.

She said: 'I'm going out to experience the new life I've been given.'

Until recently Kate believed a career in modelling was beyond her reach.

Her body twice rejected transplanted livers and there was an agonising wait for a third organ.

But just over a year after her last operation, Kate is finally able can again live a normal life.

Bright future: Kate is looking for ward to the Miss Birmingham finals on Sunday but she admits she is feeling very nervous

Kate thought taking part in Miss Birmingham would 'be a giggle' and was surprised when she made the finals

'We didn't think there would be a life for me,' she said, 'But my health is the best it has ever been. I've had no hospital admissions and my blood is fine.'

Cheering her on at this weekend's final will be proud parents Tracey and Michael. Three-year-old sister Annabel is too young to attend, but is already boasting: 'I'm going to be a princess.'

Kate added: 'I saw an advert for the competition and said, "That would be a giggle". Before I fell ill, I wanted to go into modelling, but my confidence went down.'

She was selected for the final after attending a heat at The Burlington Hotel.

'I was surprised they got back to me,' she admitted. 'It's exciting, but I'm very nervous.'

If crowned, Kate will use her year as the face of Birmingham to hammer home the importance of becoming an organ donor.

'The bottom line is if I'd not had a transplant I wouldn't be where I am now. Organ donation has been a taboo subject, but if people can see it as an important issue that would be brilliant.'

Former fashion student Kate has dedicated her 'new life' to campaigning for more donors and runs a blog called Right Let's Talk Transplants! on the topic. She also hopes to work in the bridal industry.

Sunday's winner will walk away with a clutch of prizes and a place in the Miss England final.
