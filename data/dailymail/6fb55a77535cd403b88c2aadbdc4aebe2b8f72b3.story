Cleared: PC Jonathan Johnson, 44, was cleared of assault after it was revealed a gang who accused him of punching them had made it all up

After 23 years in the force,  PC Jonathan Johnson had an unblemished record and many awards for bravery.

But that did not protect him when two foul-mouthed teenagers falsely accused him of assault.

On the strength of their accounts, the 44-year-old was suspended for a year and faced all the stress of a court case – which fell apart on Monday as a judge said their stories were ‘full of discrepancies, inaccuracies and untruths’.

District Judge Bodfan Jenkins added: ‘It’s not possible to rely on anything these witnesses say.’ Throwing out the case, he told the prosecution to pay all defence costs and criticised the Crown Prosecution Service.

The false claims related to two incidents last July, in one of which the ‘outstanding’ PC was pelted with rocks and sworn at.

Lee Dixon, then 17, and a 13-year-old who cannot legally be named said he assaulted them as he warned gangs of youths who were trespassing at a water-filled quarry. The first time he went, 30 youths pelted him with rocks and shouted: ‘Go and f*** yourself.’

PC Johnson gave the 13-year-old a ‘good old-fashioned telling off about swearing’ – but the boy later claimed the officer punched him in the ribs. The next day, he faced another group in the same area and had to push Dixon, who was aggressive, in self-defence.

Both boys complained and he was taken off front-line duties.

Almost a year later, the married father-of-two finally gave Cardiff magistrates’ court his version of events at the Wenvoe Quarry.

PC Johnson said: ‘In the two months leading up to this I had been to two drownings . . . I was extremely worried someone was going to drown. That water would have been like ice and deadly.’

Incident: Pc Johnson said he was genuinely concerned for the safety of the teenagers as they swam in the disused Wenvo Quarry near Cardiff (pictured) but the gang pelted him with rocks and told him to 'f*** off'

Of the first occasion, he said: ‘There was one lad in particular who was vociferous with his language. His abuse was too much – repeatedly being told to “f*** off” and “go and f*** myself” . . . I gave him a strong telling off.’

The next day, PC Johnson was moving a group of older teens. He asked Dixon, now 18, if he could look at his pitbull-type dog to check it was not the banned breed. He said: ‘Dixon came over the top of the quarry bank raging towards me. He was ranting and raving and said I “wouldn’t be taking his f****** dog”.

‘He came directly towards me very quickly with his head down and my initial thought was he was going to head-butt me.

‘He came right up to me and his head almost made contact. I was shocked at how the situation escalated so quickly and I had to do something. I pushed him away with both hands to the chest but he came straight back again.

‘I pushed him again and was shouting at him to keep back and calm down.’ Dixon sat down, ‘crying and hyperventilating’, the court heard. He later claimed the officer had slapped him.

Unblemished record: Pc Johnson had received bravery commendations, including for tackling a thug with a knife, but faced ruin had the case against him at Cardiff Magistrates' Court (pictured) not collapsed

PC Stewart Elson, who saw the incident, said: ‘Dixon’s attitude was aggressive and belligerent and he went face to face with PC Johnson. I saw PC Johnson grab him by both arms and say: “Sit on the bank”.’

PC Johnson was acquitted of both assault charges, and can go back to his job at the South Wales Police dog handling unit.

Judge Jenkins said: ‘There was no assault on anyone . . . It’s not possible to rely on anything these witnesses say.’

He said the CPS ‘shot [itself] in the foot’ by bringing the case even though it had accepted PC Elson’s statement.

He added that Dixon, who has past convictions for wounding and being drunk and disorderly, was ‘not telling the truth’.

A CPS spokesman said: ‘We note the comments of the District Judge . . . We are committed to ensuring all cases we bring before the courts are presented fairly and professionally.’

The court was told PC Johnson has had a glittering career.

He has received at least six commendations for bravery – for acts such as wrestling a knife attacker and disarming him, arresting a man who had two firearms in a high street, and tackling a thief while off duty. He received an excellence award for talking down a suicidal woman.

He was a finalist for a Force Award for exceptional bravery and ran seven marathons in seven days for charity Barnardo’s.
