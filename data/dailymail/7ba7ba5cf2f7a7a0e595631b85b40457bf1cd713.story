Cold mist and firework smoke gave the Etihad Stadium a peculiar type of gloom that perfectly symbolised Manchester City's current malaise as they limped to a latest damaging Champions League defeat.

It wasn't just the result that set the alarm bells ringing for England's richest club – it was the attitude of their players, most particularly Yaya Toure, and supporters which will have Sheikh Mansour demanding answers.

Manager Manuel Pellegrini was dignified afterwards, refusing to blame referee Tasos Sidiropoulos, who sent off two City players, failed to dismiss an already-booked CSKA player for shoving Sergio Aguero, and then denied Aguero an injury-time penalty. Imagine if it had been Neil Warnock addressing the media afterwards?

But Pellegrini has been in the game too long to know that City's failings go well beyond one hapless official, whatever the fans may think.

When City were struggling in the third tier of English football, their supporters were known as the best in the country.

But now they are among Europe's elite – or at least trying to join them – there is a strange lethargy about big nights at the Etihad compared to Old Trafford or Anfield.

After seeing 10,000 seats go unused for their previous home game against Roma, City allowed fans to buy two-for-one against CSKA. It swelled the attendance but not the passion or atmosphere.

Even the protest against UEFA by booing the Champions League anthem was a bit half-hearted. The first half was observed in near silence until the team were jeered off at the interval with the team 2-1 down.

At the end, the City fans were roused to shout 'cheat' at the referee – it was all very bitter and negative rather than getting behind the team from the off.

Then again, can you blame the fans when some of the players appeared surprisingly disinterested and distracted?

Some of Gael Clichy's defending was extreme to the maximum. He conceded a free-kick that allowed Seydou Doumbia to head the opening goal for CSKA. Even worse, after Toure had equalised with a trademark free-kick, Clichy hacked a simple pass across his own half straight to an opponent. Three touches later, Doumbia had beaten Joe Hart to restore Moscow's lead.

And then there's Toure. For so long the idol of City's fans who didn't begrudge his status as the Premier League's best player, he has developed into a caricature of a sulky, spoilt footballer this season.

Already booked, his pointless shove on Roman Emerenko in the second half saw him follow Fernandinho down the tunnel and killed any City prospects of salvaging a draw.

At least the Ivorian had the self-awareness to apologise later on social media.

There are mitigating factors to Toure's current mood. His younger brother died of cancer during the World Cup and the racial abuse he has received on Twitter is without doubt disturbing and unpleasant.

Yet in this kind of form he is a liability to his team-mates. His lack of positional discipline and desire to track back and defend makes the job for his central midfield partners almost impossible. Fernando was totally over-run in the first half on Wednesday night. Pellegrini may be privately relieved Toure is now suspended for the next European game at home to Bayern Munich.

We never really got to the bottom of 'Birthday Cakegate', when Toure was allegedly seething that City's Abu Dhabi owners hadn't marked his birthday by baking him a cake. The suspicion was he was trying to engineer a move back to Barcelona, when Barca failed to show much interest, he pledged his loyalty to City rather unconvincingly. Certainly, his influence on matches this season has been far less than in previous years.

Pellegrini has to accept some blame as well. Given that Toure is a bit of a loose cannon in midfield, it seems strange that an experienced coach like himself will regularly leave his team outnumbered in the key central area. He let Gareth Barry and Javi Garcia, both natural sitting players, leave and won't start with Fernandinho, who was terrific last season.

The plans against CSKA were a mess. Fernando was expected to stop Moscow's counter-attacks almost single-handed while Stevan Jovetic, Jesus Navas and Toure ineffectually stood by.

By the time he sent on Fernandinho to rectify it at half-time, the Brazilian was so pumped up, he got a quick yellow card. The manager then gambled by taking Fernando off for Edin Dzeko with City behind, leaving Fernandinho as the only natural holder – and then he got sent off. A tragedy of errors. Incidentally, the Brazilian also apologised for his red.

If Pellegrini is at fault tactically, the owners can't avoid some degree of responsibility. Their historic breaking of the Financial Fair Play regulations means the manager has been forced to pick a reduced squad for the Champions League this season.

Strikers Alvaro Negredo and John Guidetti have been loaned out because there is no room for them, leaving Pellegrini having to chase four trophies with just three strikers.

He has said that Angel di Maria and Falcao were never options because City couldn't afford their transfer fees or wages under the FFP restrictions.

On the bright side, City have been here before – in both title-winning seasons under Roberto Mancini and Pellegrini, they were written off at stages in the season but dug in when nobody else believed, and came out on top.

Bayern's dominance of their Champions League group means the second spot is still up for grabs. A victory against the German champions, who have already qualified, will set up a likely winner-takes-all meeting away to Roma. Difficult, but not impossible for a team who have Aguero and David Silva on their books.

The continuing presence of Sergio Aguero at the Etihad is a major positive for City and their fans

The truth is that the fault for City's current problems have to be shared between manager, star players, owners and fans.

Only by rallying together can they turn this around. If they each act with the petulance of Toure's childish shove, they are in big trouble.
