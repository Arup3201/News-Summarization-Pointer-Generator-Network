It's the bane of drivers on country roads that can add long delays to your journey – but now ministers have pledged to speed up slow-moving tractors.

The Department of Transport has put forward a proposal to raise the tractor speed limit to 25mph in a bid to make farmers and rural transport more efficient, and give a multi-million-pound boost to the economy.

Ending the current 20mph limit would bring Britain into line with other countries in the EU, as well as shaving time off those frustrating delays for drivers who find themselves stuck in a slow-moving convoy of traffic behind a tractor.

Tailback: The move would see farmer's rural transport become more efficient, according to ministers

In a consultation document released last week, the department argues that the current 20mph speed limit for tractors does ‘not reflect the capabilities of modern farm machinery, forcing farmers to drive unnecessarily slowly on public roads’.

The productivity boost to farmers  from increasing the speed limit by 5mph has been calculated to save farmers £89.72 million a year – or more than  £1.13 billion over ten years.

The figures were calculated on the basis of shorter journey times, greater fuel economy and improved productivity.

Transport Minister Robert Goodwill announced a 90-day public consultation into the changes.

Backing the changes to help the economy, he said: ‘It would also mean that motorists who get frustrated behind a tractor would not be travelling quite as slowly.’

Up to speed: The move would see British farmers brought in line with their European colleagues who are already able to drive at 25mph
