When Amal Alamuddin tied the knot with George Clooney last summer, she secured her status as one of the world's favourite style icons.

The Lebanese-born lawyer, 37, shot from relative obscurity to most envied woman in the world overnight - and her wardrobe got a high fashion makeover, too.

She already wowed with a fashion-forward capsule wardrobe over her wedding in the summer, but as she stepped this week, Amal proved she's not afraid to experiment with the season's hottest - and most daring - trends.

Amal Clooney, who was spotted in high-waisted bold yellow chevron print bell bottoms by Giambattista Valli and a shaggy crop top as she stepped out for dinner in New York on Tuesday, is proving she's on top of the season's hottest trends

On both outings this week, Amal has revisited the Seventies, championing flared trousers.

They were all the rage with the Studio 54 set and boho beauties such as Farah Fawcett, but flares are back with a vengeance this season - and Amal is bang-on-trend. 

How things have changed! As a high-flying barrister, left, in 2011, Amal stuck to more pared-back style classics, such as beige trench coats and muted grey suits but today, right, she is rocking the most daring trends in her own sophisticated way

Amal Clooney is really going all out for the flared trouser trend at the moment.

It's her second night out this week, and whilst last time she revisited the Seventies via her bell bottom jeans by Stella McCartney, today's trousers are not so subtle. Check out the bold yellow chevron print!

They're by Giambattista Valli, Amal's go-to designer label when she wants to make a style statement. That floral embellished dress she wore the day after her wedding? That was Valli. The leopard print coat she wore for dinner with George's mother in New York on Monday? Yep, you guessed it!

Amal wasn't in a matchy matchy mood so swapped the jacket they were shown with (pictured) for a black feather trim top and added platform heels and a clutch bag.

The 37-year-old was spotted in high-waisted bold yellow chevron print bell bottoms by Giambattista Valli and a shaggy crop top as she stepped out for dinner in New York on Tuesday.

On Monday, Amal rocked flared jeans by Stella McCartney and teamed them with a retro inspired leopard print coat from Giambattista Valli's Pre Fall 2015 collection featuring a cream trim detail and sheepskin collar. 

The looks - and those she has been quietly championing over the last six months - are a far cry from the more safe, corporate style she embraced before meeting George.

As a high-flying barrister, Amal stuck to more pared-back style classics, such as beige trench coats and muted grey suits.

Accessories-wise, she toted high street handbags and chunky block heel shoes or Mary Janes - a far cry from high-end looks she loves today.

Amal Alamuddin looked chic and sophisticated - and added her own stamp on a classic black dress with white gloves - at the 72nd Annual Golden Globe Awards in January 

As well as pulling off the season's most savvy trends with aplomb, she has apparently done it all by herself without the help of a single stylist.

As the Evening Standard reports: 'According to fashion sources, she has eschewed the offers of stylists and personal assistants and prefers to trust her own instincts.'

Speaking about her style transformation, fashion writer Simon Glazin said: 'Amal is surely now the First Lady of Hollywood? She has got the high-profile hubby, has her own amazing career, will now of course be enlisted to help with charities and has the most incredible designer wardrobe.

'From monochrome Dolce & Gabbana to stand-out red McQueen dresses via trendy bell bottoms and midriff-baring tops, she is working the trends in her own classy way.

'Women will want her wardrobe, and they will try and emulate her looks. She's aspirational and has proven to be a style icon in the making. 

'She is always wearing the clothes rather than them wearing her. She wears couture exactly as it's meant to be worn - fitted down to the last millimetre and with confidence - and wears more daring looks with sophistication.

'What a women! What a clever woman!'.

Her style was classic in 2011, left, but she's put a high-fashion spin on her signature look in recent months - and apparently doesn't employ a stylist 

Two years ago, pictured, Amal championed an altogether different style to today and fashion writer Simon Glazin says she's come a long way and women will want her wardrobe of today
