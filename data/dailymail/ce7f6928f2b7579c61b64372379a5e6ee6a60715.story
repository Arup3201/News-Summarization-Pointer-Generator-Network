The father of three young children who were murdered with their mother died from a single gunshot wound to the head, an autopsy has shown.

Police identified the man, who is at the centre of a murder-suicide investigation in Salem, Oregon, involving five family members, as 27-year-old Nikolai Lazukin.

His body was found on Tuesday in a car in Cottage Grove, 80 miles south of a fire-damaged house where his wife and three children were found dead.

Authorities said the wife and two of the children had been shot, and an infant asphyxiated.

Neither police nor Deputy State Medical Examiner Larry Lewman would officially call the death a suicide and would not release any other details of the investigation.

Firefighters who entered the burning home discovered the bodies of infant Sefi Lazukin, one-year-old Zoe Lazukin, three-year-old Angelica Lazukin and the children's 26-year-old mother, Natalya Lazukin.

More than 100 people gathered for a memorial service outside the home on Wednesday night.

A youth group from the Slavic Christian Church in Salem, where the family worshipped, tied balloons to a fence, and the crowd sang Amazing Grace in Russian.

'They were all wonderful,' said Irina Thompson, a relative of Nikolai Lazukin by marriage.

'Nik was so good with the kids. I can't understand why this would happen, but sometimes people change.'

The woman and children were discovered early on Tuesday when Salem firefighters responded to a house fire  located in the 2800 block of Fisher Road Northeast.

'As firefighters were attending to the fire in the residence, they located the three young children and the woman and removed them from the house,' said Lieutenant Dave Okada, a spokesman for the Salem Police Department, told journalists earlier this week.

'Evidence located at the scene indicated that the victims died as a result of homicidal violence and firefighters requested the Salem Police Department respond.'

A neighbour reported awaking about 5:30 am to the fire.

Dan Grove told the Salem Statesman Journal that he 'saw dark, black smoke pouring out of the house. I heard people screaming and yelling. It was for real.'

About five hours later, the father was found dead in a vehicle about 80 miles south of Salem, in Cottage Grove.

Salem, the state capital, is about 50 miles south of Portland along Interstate 5.

Firefighters who came to the house found evidence of violence, said Salem police Lt Dave Okada.

An hour before that, Okada said, a driver making deliveries found the body of a sixth person on the street a quarter mile north of the house.

But Okada wouldn't say whether that death was related to those in the house.

'At this point we're treating that as an entirely separate investigation,' Okada said.

He said authorities were arranging for autopsies and police blocked off much of the neighbourhood.

News of the investigation spread rapidly through the tight-knit community.

'I'm really sorry for them,' said Sergey Shcherbakov, who described the family as quiet.

'And I'm surprised and actually, I never expected they'd fall in this situation.'

Other residents were simply shocked that their neighbourhood had become a crime scene.

'I just think it's awful,' neighbour Dan Grove said.

'He seemed like a really nice guy.'

Clara King, who lives in an apartment about 50 yards from the home that burned, said she was awake in the middle of the night and heard a woman screaming, 'like she was being hurt.'

'I thought it was the neighbour lady having a party or something,' said Ms King.

'I went out there to say something, but nobody was there.'

Some residents spoke about the area being a rough neighbourhood.

Ms King said it's not unusual to hear screams or fights in the middle of the night.

One mother was appalled at the deaths of the three children.

'It's morbid; it's absolutely morbid,' said Katie Guzman who lives nearby. 

'My heart goes out to the kids. That's awful, she said to Wave3.Com

'Just to imagine what they went through.'

She said she had never suspected there were any problems at the home.

'You'd see mom and dad and baby out front,' she said.

'She'd be sitting on the porch... dad (was) fixing stuff in that yard. Other than that, they were quiet.

'You'd never suspect anything.'

Authorities said the wife and two of the children had been shot, and an infant asphyxiated.

Other neighbours were shocked too.

'We're worried because we don't know what happened inside,' said Magdiel Perez, who lives two doors down from the home that burned.

On the lime-green home where the children and their mother died, black soot coated the edges of window frames earlier this week.

The family was quiet and kept to themselves, said Jose Quiroz, who lives across the street.

The father would frequently play with the children in the yard, and last summer, the kids splashed in a pool on the lawn, Quiroz said.

There were no outward signs of conflict between the couple, he said.

'It's unbelievable that someone could hurt their own kids,' Quiroz.
