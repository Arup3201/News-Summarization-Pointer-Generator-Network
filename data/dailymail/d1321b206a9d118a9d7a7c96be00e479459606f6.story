Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo was nowhere to be seen in Roy Hodgson's three votes for the award as the England boss instead picked Barcelona midfielder Javier Mascherano for the gong.

There was no place either for Lionel Messi as Hodgson selected Germany's World Cup-winning captain Philipp Lahm as his second choice and voted goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, one of the favourites for the award, third.

Hodgson brifefly managed Mascherano after becoming Liverpool boss in July 2010 before the midfielder departed Anfield for Barcelona two months later.

Hodgson's first choice may raise a few eyebrows but the England boss wasn't the only manager to select Mascherano for the award. Belarus head coach Alyaksandr Khatskevich also picked the 30-year-old for the main prize.

Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher, who played for Liverpool and England, joked on Twitter: 'Love Roy Hodgson going for a clean sheet with his Ballon d'Or picks. 1) Mascherano 2) Lahm 3) Neuer.'

Ronaldo may have missed out on a nomination from Hodgson but did receive one from England captain Wayne Rooney who awarded his former Manchester United team-mate his first vote. 

Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos, signed from Bayern Munich in the summer, has impressed the Manchester United skipper enough to take second place in the vote with Gareth Bale  third in Rooney's picks.

The England frontman - who earned his 100th international cap in 2014 - failed to pick up a single nomination from the 544 international captains, coaches and journalists given a vote.

37.7 per cent of the votes went to Ronaldo as the Portugal international finished ahead of Messi and Neuer

As captains of their respective nations, Portugal star Ronaldo and Argentina talisman Messi were each given a vote but decided against picking each other.

Portugal skipper Ronaldo selected three of his Real Madrid team-mates following his side's La Decima triumph with his first vote going to defender Sergio Ramos. Gareth Bale was selected second with French forward Karim Benzema completing Ronaldo's trio of picks.

Messi's first vote, meanwhile, went to compatriot Angel di Maria. The forward's second vote went to his Barcelona team-mate Andres Iniesta while Hodgson favourite Mascherano was Messi's third choice.
