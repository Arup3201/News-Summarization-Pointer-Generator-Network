A day after a woman reported finding an abandoned newborn crying in the sand on a Hawaii beach, police arrested her and revealed she's the baby's mother.

Police say Keala Simeona brought a newborn baby to a Honolulu hospital, saying she found the infant on the beach

Keala Simeona, 21, of Honolulu, was arrested on Tuesday for filing a false police report.

Police don't expect to pursue additional offenses at this time. She posted $250 bail and was released.

She had told police she was parked at Sandy Beach in east Honolulu sometime between 11:30pm on Sunday and midnight when she heard several people screaming.

After the screaming stopped, she said, she walked toward the ocean and found the naked newborn and took her to a hospital.

It's up to Family Court to decide whether to return the child to her family or whether parental rights will be terminated, the state Department of Human Services said in a statement.

An initial hearing is scheduled for Monday.

To determine parentage, the department plans to ask the court to order the mother to submit to DNA testing.

It will also seek DNA testing for the father, if a father is identified.

Department Director Patricia McManaman said on Monday that the full-term, 8-pound baby was born immediately before she was found. However, officials couldn't pinpoint an exact time of birth.

The baby was doing well and drinking formula at the hospital, McManaman said, while police investigated the case as child abandonment.

McManaman said police were investigating the case as endangering the welfare of a minor and child abandonment.

Ms McManaman said the baby was 'recovering well' in hospital.

She said. 'We're just very grateful this child is alive and doing well.'

In 2007, Hawaii became the 48th state with a baby safe haven law which provides mothers withÂ  immunity from prosecution for leaving an unharmed newborn within 72 hours of birth at a fire department, police station or hospital or with emergency services.

No one has taken advantage of the law since it was enacted, Ms McManaman said.

Human services officials are informally calling her Baby Sandy.
