Robin van Persie praised how Holland played out Louis van Gaal's elaborate masterplan to see off Spain - and the new Manchester United boss knew they would thrash the world champions, according to Robin van Persie.

The Dutch striker grabbed two goals, including a stunning diving header, as 2010's losing finalists ran riot over the Spaniards.

Few could see beyond Spain before kick off with their brilliant defensive record and back-to-back tournament wins providing formidable opposition, but Van Gaal's Holland ripped them apart in a stunning 5-1 win.

And Van Persie, set to continue under Van Gaal when he takes over at Old Trafford after the World Cup, was eager to share in some mutual back-slapping with Van Gaal, giving him the lionâ€™s share of the credit for the result.

'This is incredible and inexplicable,' Van Persie told Voetbal International. 'For us, this is a dream come true and we have to enjoy it - everyone in Holland must too.

'This is because of the coach. He has prepared us great and he predicted how the game would go. Itâ€™s incredible, because it was exactly as he and the staff predicted for us.'

Van Gaal will take over the Old Trafford hotseat at the conclusion of the tournament, and United fans have been delighted with how he seems to got the best out of Van Persie after a difficult season for the former champions.

In winning 5-1, Holland inflicted Spain's worst defeat in 51 years and Van Gaal's side produced a result that nobody could have expected, with some bookmakers pricing a 5-1 win at 500/1 pre-match.

'In the end, it could have been six, seven or eight,' Van Persie said. 'But, really, it couldnâ€™t be better.'
