With a torch and time-lapse photography, the whole world becomes a canvas for artists who create ‘magic’ light paintings.

Russian artists Dmitry Alekseevich Makarov, 29, and Catherine Larina, 28 are following in the footsteps of Pablo Picasso who experimented with light painting with stunning effect in 1949.

Makarov and Larina from Moscow spend hours creating their works, painting with light to create illuminated animals and human figures.

'Magic' light: Russian artists Dmitry Alekseevich Makarov and Catherine Larina have followed in Pablo Picasso's footsteps, using a light technique to create paintings using a hand-held light source

Makarov said: ‘Painting with light is amazing because the light is alive.

‘It’s like magic. The images drawn by the light reveal to us our vision for the arts, and the light painter has the whole world as their canvas.’

To create a light painting a camera is set up on a tripod with the shutter open for a timed exposure while a hand-held light source, such as a torch, is moved in the air in a pattern. The camera captures the outline.

Takes time: Creating these light paintings can take several weeks to perfect

Picasso created some stunning photographs when he offered to paint with light in five sessions with lighting innovator Gjon Mili in 1949.

In a series known as his 'light drawings', the images show the artist waving a strobe light to create figures reminiscent of the screaming cattle in Guernica or the curvaceous woman in The Dreamer.

Mili, a photographer for LIFE magazine, visited Picasso in the south of France, and showed him images he had created by fixing lights on the shoes of ice skaters as they jumped through the dark.

The artist was instantly taken and began tracing shapes through the air with his finger, hinting at the light doodles to come.

Bright idea: Lighting innovator Gjon Mili visited Picasso in the south of France and together they created 30 images including this one as Picasso 'draws' a centaur with light

'Picasso gave Mili 15 minutes to try one experiment,' LIFE wrote in its January 30, 1950, issue, in which the images were first published. 'He was so fascinated by the results that he posed for five sessions.'

Picasso held a small electric light and moved it through a darkened room. Two cameras were used - one to give a side view and another for a front view.

Many of the 30 images the two men created were put on display in early 1950 at New York's Museum of Modern Art.

Strong urge to create: Makarov loves this art form because he often feels a strong, irresistible urge to create an image which he describes as a 'flight of feelings'

Makarov and Larina have also been very taken with the art form, having exhibited light paintings and work as part of art collective lightpaint.ru.

Makarov said of the creative process: ‘Suddenly there is a strong, irresistible urge to create an image. The created image is a flight of feelings or a flight of thought.

‘Sometimes you are not thinking and the hand is just drawing itself.

‘I think there is something weird and unearthly about light painting and I love this art form with all my heart.’

Completing a single painting can take several weeks, he said.
