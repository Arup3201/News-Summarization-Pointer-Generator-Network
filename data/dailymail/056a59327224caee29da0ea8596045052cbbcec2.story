Watching while anthropologists painstakingly work to uncover the makeshift graves of their loved ones, this is a stark reminder of the horrific genocide from which they so desperately fled almost two decades on from the country's civil war.

With pain etched all over their faces, this is the first opportunity the Mayan Indians of Guatemala have had to say a proper goodbye to thousands of relatives killed 17 years after the bloodshed stopped.

Forensic experts are now exhuming bodies from the cemeteries that the Ixil Mayan people created to bury loved ones who died of starvation, hypothermia and disease - as well as those directly killed by the war - while they hid from the soldiers in the mountains. 

Largely ignored by authorities for centuries, the Ixil have come under the spotlight in recent months after a Guatemalan court found former dictator Efrain Rios Montt guilty of genocide in May for the scorched-earth policies used against the Mayans during his 17 months in power in the 1980s.

That conviction was quashed 10 days later following a trial that did nothing to change their lives of the Ixil people.

And now feels like the right time for many of the Ixil to tell their story and to help locate the bodies of their relatives.

Almost 20 years on, the Ixil still live in mud-and-wood houses in the most rugged and isolated parts of northwestern Guatemala. Most of them have no drinking water, paved roads or basic services such as health and education.

Byron Garcia, a social anthropologist who has worked in the area for a decade, said Ixil Mayans live in the same poverty as always.

He said: 'People have been relegated to less productive places, places where you can't grow food, to the mountains made of stone.

'The young people who can, sow plots of land. And when they can't, they migrate.'

Horrific history: A group of Mayan men, women and even children gather around as an extensive search is carried out for some of the thousands killed during the civil war which ended 17 years ago

Exhumation: The Mayans hid in the mountains from soldiers during the war and buried many of their dead in mass graves. Many of the dead died from starvation, hypothermia or disease

Feliciana Cobo was 8 when soldiers attacked her village. She and her family separated and ran into the mountains, where they hid for several days with nothing to eat. 

Cobo said her mother was killed when the army bombed the village and surrounding area, and her grandmother died later after growing sick from the cold and bad living conditions. Her family eventually lost their land and their poverty deepened.

Now a single mother of three children, the 40-year-old Cobo borrows electricity from a neighbor and supports her kids by washing the clothes of neighbors and weaving garments to sell.

'I grew up during the civil war and I don't know how to read or write. I didn't go to school. All I know is to weave.'

Cobo helped exhume her mother and said that she feels that revisiting the graves proves that they are not 'inventing the dead.'

She said: 'I helped exhume my mother. I don't know if it was the smoke or the impact of the bombs planes were dropping on us but we all left running and when we got back together, my mother had already died.'

She added that she doubts justice will 
be done, but is glad some fellow Ixil Mayans could travel to Guatemala 
City to tell their stories at the trial.

Mr Garcia, who now lives in the Guatemalan capital, said that victims feel a need to tell their stories, to be heard, to be indemnified, to find the bodies of their loved ones and be able to bury them.
