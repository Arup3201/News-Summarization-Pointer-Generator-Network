Wanted man: Ryan MacDonald, 20, was captured today by armed police after 10 days on the run

A man who escaped from a prison van when it was ambushed as it took him to court was recaptured tonight in an armed raid.

Ryan MacDonald, 20, was caught just after 5pm by armed officers at a house in Ordsall, Salford, said Greater Manchester Police.

He and another man were freed by a trio of armed men in Salford as their van made its way to Manchester Crown Court from a prison in Merseyside on April 30.

Detective Chief Superintendent Darren Shenton said: 'We said on that day that we would return both men to custody and we have today made good on that promise.

'The last ten days has seen intense and continued activity from the force as part of our ongoing commitment to find not only the two men but those responsible for the attack on the van.

'As well as this latest arrest, we have arrested and charged a number of other people in connection with what happened and the people of Greater Manchester can be assured that we will not rest until every single person behind this incident is located and brought to justice.'

MacDonald was due to be sentenced for conspiracy to commit robbery and aggravated vehicle taking when he escaped.

He was part of a gang who 
targeted pawnbrokers in Manchester and Salford where jewellery was 
stolen in daylight smash-and-grab raids.

His delayed hearing was held in his absence last Friday at Manchester Crown Court as he was jailed for seven years and 10 months.

The defendant, of Allendale Walk, Salford, had pleaded guilty to the offences at an earlier hearing.

Police had issued a £10,000 reward for information leading to MacDonald's arrest.

Escape: MacDonald and McMullen went missing from a prison van on April 30

Recaptured: Both men have now been found by police, with McMullen caught on Sunday and MacDonald today

Another man, Stevie McMullen, 31, appeared in court last week charged with escaping lawful custody in connection with the incident and was remanded in custody.

Police caught McMullen on Sunday, when he was travelling in a car with two other men on the A6, near Lancaster University.

At the time of the escape, he was due to appear on trial for conspiracies to kidnap, rob, commit arson
 and possess a firearm.

While MacDonald was still missing, GMP Assistant Chief Constable Steve 
Heywood said: ‘A £10,000 reward was put 
forward for information leading to the capture of these two men.

'This 
full £10,000 reward still stands for anyone who gives us information 
that leads to MacDonald's arrest and will be paid when he is back behind
 bars.'

Shortly after 9am on April 30, a prison
 van carrying prisoners from HMP Altcourse to Manchester Crown Square 
was attacked on Regent Road, Salford, by at least three men wearing dark
 clothing and balaclavas.

The men had arrived at the location in a dark coloured Saab and threatened staff transporting the prisoners with a shotgun.

Five men - believed to be three 
offenders and the two escaped prisoners - then got back into the Saab, 
which was driven a short distance and abandoned.

It is believed three ran towards a nearby estate and two may have further escaped on a motorbike that was later found abandoned.

On Tuesday, April 30 a 28-year-old 
woman and 24-year-old man were detained at a house on the Ordsall 
estate, Salford on suspicion of being involved in assisting an offender.

They have been released on bail pending further inquiries until June 
26.

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 0161 856 5237, Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or, in an emergency, call 999.
