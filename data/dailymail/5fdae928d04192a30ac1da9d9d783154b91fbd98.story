'Vulnerabilities': The British military's head of cyber security Major General Jonathan Shaw (above) says the Ministry of Defence has been attacked by hackers

Cyber criminals have managed to hack into some of the Ministry of Defence's top secret computer systems, the military's head of cyber-security has admitted.

Major General Jonathan Shaw said the number of serious incidents was 'quite small', but conceded it was likely that some attacks had gone undetected.

Maj Gen Shaw said the level of cyber 
attacks were 'still on an upward curve', meaning increasing the security
of the military's computer networks was now a top priority.

The admission comes just days after 
The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) was forced to take its website
offline after being targeted by hackers.

In March, it emerged that senior British military figures and MoD staff 
opened themselves up to potential security breaches by accepting friend 
requests from a bogus Facebook account set up in the name of Nato's top 
commander.

It was also revealed earlier this year how British military officials and civil 
servants in the Cabinet Office were victims of cyber group Anonymous that hacked into a
U.S. intelligence firm's computers over Christmas.

Maj Gen Shaw said: 'The number of serious incidents is quite small, but it is there. And those are the ones we know about. The likelihood is there are problems in there we don't know about.'

Maj Gen Shaw, a veteran of the Falklands and Iraq wars, did not say who was behind the attacks on the MoD.

He said that next year's MoD budget was expected to include new money to improve cyber-defence despite widespread cutbacks.

'I think it was a surprise to people this
year quite how vulnerable we are, which is why the measures have 
survived so long in the (budget) because people have become aware of the
vulnerabilities and are taking them seriously,' he said in an interview with The Guardian.

Maj Gen Shaw, who has spent the last year reviewing the MoD's approach to cyber-security, also said the MoD had to embrace unconventional ideas and develop an array of its own cyber-weapons if it wanted to catch up with and then stay ahead of its rivals.

'One needs to engage in internal defence and be quite aggressive about it. And if you are going to manoeuvre in cyberspace, that is something that obviously involves action across the spectrum.'

Earlier this week, SOCA was forced to take its website offline after being targeted by cyber criminals.

It was the victim of a scam known as 
distributed denial of service (DDOS) whereby an internet address is 
flooded with bogus traffic, effectively making it unreachable.

Breached: Last month, the Home Office website went down after an apparent cyber attack by hacking group Anonymous (above)

The Home Office website also went down last month after an apparent cyber attack in protest against Government surveillance plans.

A message on Twitter claiming to be from Anonymous, a loosely organised group of hackers who promote access to free speech, information and transparency, said the action was 'for [the Home Office's] draconian surveillance proposals'.

Over Christmas, the online 'hacktivist' group also claimed via Twitter on that it had stolen a trove of emails and credit card information from U.S. intelligence firm Stratfor's member subscribers.

Details of senior British intelligence officials and U.S. defence staff were hacked, according to analysis by John Bumgarner, an expert in cyber-security at the US Cyber Consequences Unit, a research body in Washington.

Some 221 British military officials and 242 NATO staff were also victims along with advisers to Britain's Joint Intelligence Organisation, a body which reports sensitive information to Prime Minister David Cameron, Mr Bumgarner found.

In March, it was revealed that Nato's most senior commander had been embroiled in a major security alert after a fake Facebook account was set up in his name by ‘Chinese spies’.

Senior British military officers and Ministry of Defence staff are understood to have accepted ‘friend requests’ from a bogus account for Nato’s Supreme Allied Commander James Stavridis.

In the mistaken belief they had linked up with the American admiral on the site, they then unwittingly provided a treasure trove of personal details – including pictures, phone numbers and email addresses.

Nato did officially say who was behind the cyber-fraud or who accepted friend requests but it is understood that evidence points to Chinese state-sponsored hackers.
