A woman who failed to reveal she was  a convicted thief when she applied to become a police constable is suing Scotland Yard for discrimination.

Rachida Sobhi’s bid to become a WPC was turned down when background checks revealed she had a criminal record for stealing from a previous employer. But she has launched legal action against the force, claiming that she has amnesia that caused her to forget her crime – but no other aspect of her life.

It is believed that Ms Sobhi is the first person with amnesia to have been declared disabled for the purposes of an employment tribunal.

Astonishingly, her claim has been backed by a renowned psychiatrist – but the MetropolitanPolice is ‘vigorously’ contesting  her case, arguing that her condition is irrelevant as she would not be allowed to become a constable with her criminal record in any case.

The case, which has been described as ‘bizarre’, has raised fresh concerns about the compensation culture in the police. Earlier this year The Mail on Sunday revealed that PC Kelly Jones was suing a petrol station owner because she tripped over his kerb while investigating a possible break-in.

Ms Sobhi, who is already employed by the Met as a  Police Community Support Officer, has had her case dismissed by an employment tribunal. But she won the right to a fresh hearing after a senior judge ruled she was indeed disabled when she filled in the application form.

As a PCSO – nicknamed ‘plastic police’ because of their lack of arrest powers – she can earn up to £28,539 a year. She previously worked in Notting Hill in West London and continues to be employed by the Met as part of a ‘safer neighbourhoods team’ in Bromley, South East London, patrolling local streets with regular police officers and attending community events.

Mr Justice Keith allowed a new hearing. He said that she forgot about her conviction due to traumatic events in her life

In August 2008 she applied to become a
constable but when her fingerprints were taken as part of the process 
it emerged that she had a criminal record.

‘She
had been convicted in 1991 of an offence of theft from a previous 
employer for which she had been conditionally discharged,’ according to 
the judgment of the appeal tribunal published this week.

It
is understood she had been a cashier in a department store in Brixton, 
South London, and was arrested with other staff for stealing make-up.

Friends say she protested her 
innocence at the time but she was convicted and received a conditional 
discharge, which means the offence went on her criminal record but she 
received no further punishment.

Ms
Sobhi received a disciplinary reprimand for not mentioning the 
conviction in her initial application to become a PCSO or during her 
attempt to become a PC.

Undeterred, in November 2009 she applied again to become a constable and was knocked back because of her reprimand – but bosses made clear her conviction would have ruled her out anyway. Although around 1,000 police officers and PCSOs in England and Wales are thought to have criminal records, those found guilty of serious offences such as dishonesty are not allowed to serve in the force.

A year later Ms Sobhi, who is of Moroccan background and thought to be in her early 40s, filed a claim  in the London Central employment tribunal ‘complaining of discrimination on the ground of her sex, her sexual orientation, her religion or beliefs, her age and her disability’  against the Met and several individuals. 

It was claimed that the Met treated her ‘less favourably’ because of her condition and failed to take ‘reasonable steps’ to accommodate her.

‘Her case is that when she had originally applied to become a police constable, she had forgotten about her conviction and the facts to which it related as a result of traumatic events in her life,’ said tribunal judge Mr Justice Keith.

The Met apparently accepts she was suffering from ‘dissociative amnesia’ – a form of mental illness that involves gaps in memory – when she filled in the questionnaire. But its lawyers say she should have admitted ‘she did not know whether or not she had any convictions’.

At a pre-hearing review in May 2011, neuropsychiatrist Michael Kopelman said Ms Sobhi had been suffering from depression.

The case has raised new concerns about the compensation culture in the police. PC Kelly Jones sued the force for a prang in her car

The expert said her memory loss was likely to be a genuine effect of ‘traumatic circumstances’ and that it only affected ‘her ability to recall events around the time of her arrest and conviction in 1991’.

The Mail on Sunday has attempted to establish what these circumstances were. Although Ms Sobhi, her lawyers and the police declined to explain, sources have suggested she had a baby when young and had a difficult family life. She got married in 1991 but later separated from her husband. 

Yet the ‘relatively small gap’ in her memory did not affect her current job, Prof Kopelman said. Her discrimination claim was initially dismissed by a judge, who ruled she had not been disabled at the time of the job application.

But last month Mr Justice Keith said: ‘Ms Sobhi’s appeal must be allowed, the employment judge’s finding that she was not a disabled person must be set aside, as must his order that her claim of discrimination on the ground of her disability be dismissed. The case must be remitted to the employment tribunal.’

The fresh hearing will consider if Ms
Sobhi actually knew she had amnesia when she filled in the form, and if
it had a substantial effect on her day-to-day activities.

A
Met spokesman said: ‘We believe the first hearing outcome was the 
correct one and will vigorously defend our position at all future 
hearings. We would not wish to  discuss our position further prior  to 
proceedings.’

The average 
compensation awarded in employment tribunals in cases of disability 
discrimination last year was £22,183. The maximum awarded was £390,871, 
although there is no upper limit.

Dissociative amnesia is a real  condition triggered by traumatic events rather than physical injury, say experts. 

But they stress it is almost always caused by extreme incidents such as repeated childhood sexual abuse. Sufferers’ brains forget the events to escape the emotional pain of the memory. 

Dr Christopher Findlay explained the condition was considered ‘dissociative’ because sufferers ‘separated off an emotional part of themselves’  by forgetting a trauma.The condition is included in  the psychiatrists’ ‘bible’, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).

But Dr Findlay said the condition was ‘very rare’ and was not usually confined to forgetting a single event. He said he would want to have an extensive psychiatric report to prove a single episode of amnesia was ‘part of a wider disorder’.

And clinical psychologist Dr Roderick Orner said: ‘Memory loss of such a one-off event does not really fit the typical profile for dissociative amnesia.’

Brian Paddick, a former deputy assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard, said: ‘It’s a complete and utter farce. I think it’s extraordinary. 

‘People with convictions for dishonesty should not be police officers, full stop. We’ve got enough problems with people not trusting the police as it is.’

But he denied the Met had a wider problem with Employment Tribunal claims, saying: ‘The fact that they didn’t give way and are defending it shows that they are trying to stand up for themselves.’

Keith Vaz MP, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘This is a bizarre case and appears to extend the law beyond what Parliament has intended. The Met is absolutely right to resist this claim. It is essential that there is full disclosure at the time of applications to join the police.’

Dissociative amnesia is a type of memory loss not linked to a physical cause, such as a head injury, but traumatic events, such as being in a car crash or childhood abuse, and some doctors doubt it can be triggered by relatively trivial events.
