Jayde Dinsdale, the teenager who collapsed and almost died after drinking cocktails of energy drinks and Jagermeister, now says she drank just four Jagerbombs, which she believes which triggered her three heart attacks.

Speaking on ITV's This Morning, Jayde, 18, said that she had met up with friends after work earlier this year and had four cocktails in two hours.Â 

Jagerbombs, a mixture of caffeine-rich energy drinks and the German alcoholic spirit Jagermeister, have become extremely popular with young people who often knock them back in one shot.

Jayde Dinsdale told This Morning how drinking energy drink cocktails caused her to collapse

Blonde Jayde, who was accompanied by her father Darryl, 38, told This Morning hosts Philip Schofield and Holly Willoughby that she had drank four of the cocktails in two hours and had felt 'absolutely fine. I went home, went to bed and felt perfectly normal.'

However she did admit that she has no memory of the night or the following morning, saying: 'I'm relying on what everyone else has told me.'

The next morning Jayde collapsed in the bathroom of the family home near Yeovil, Somerset.

Said Darryl: 'I was downstairs in the kitchen and I heard a massive thump. Jayde's mum then screamed at me to get up there.'

Jayde said she had gone to bed as normal. The next day she had three heart attacks

When he got upstairs, he discovered his daughter lying on the floor.

'She was purple,' he said. 'It was every parent's worst nightmare.'

While Jayde's mum Natalie, 38, dialled 999, quick-thinking Darryl stayed calm and started pumping his daughter's chest in a desperate attempt to keep her alive.

'I've got to thank Vinnie Jones and those adverts he did with the tune 'Staying Alive,' said Darryl. 'It just clicked in my head and I just started doing it.'

Later the paramedics who attended to Jayde told him that without his actions it would have been 'highly unlikely' that they would have been able to save her.

Jayde, who had suffered two cardiac arrests on the bathroom floor, was taken to the intensive care unit at Yeovil District Hospital. She then had a third arrest and was then put in a 52-hour coma to protect her brain and heart.

Her body was cooled to just 32 degrees to protect her brain and her family faced an agonising wait to see if she would recover.

She then had to spend another three weeks in hospital and had an internal defibrillator fitted to get her heart started again in case she has another attack.

Darryl, 38, said that he remembered the British Heart Foundation adverts in which Vinnie Jones does CPR

Darryl said it was a mystery as to why she had such a bad reaction to the drinks as she had previously drunk Jagerbombs with no bad effect, and had no reaction to other caffeinated drinks such as coffee before.

'We had no idea that this sort of thing could happen,' he said.

This Morning's Dr Dawn Harper said that such a massive reactive to caffeine was 'thankfully very rare' but warned that 'caffeine is a stimulant, it can make you more alert and we say that you shouldn't really have more than 400mg in a 24-hour period [equivalent to around four cups of coffee].

Jayde and Darryl Dinsdale were joined by Dr Dawn Porter who said that people should watch their caffeine intake

'Some energy drinks can have as much as 200mg in a can and you were clearly very sensitive to caffeine,' she told Jayde.

She added that sometimes the labelling on energy drinks could be wrong, giving a misleading impression of how much caffeine they contained.

Gavin Partingdon of the British Soft Drinks Association said that people should drink caffeinated drinks 'in moderation' and that they were not recommended for people with a sensitivity to caffeine.

One in ten British teenagers consumes four to five energy drinks a week

High in sugar, cleverly 
marketed and sold in supermarkets and shops alongside regular soft 
drinks, it's easy to see why young people in their masses have taken to 
energy drinks.

Last year, a major study found our children have one of the highest consumption rates in Europe.

One in ten British teenagers consumes four to five energy drinks a week.

Worryingly,
 younger children are following suit: one in four under-tens - 24 per 
cent - has had at least one energy drink in the past year, compared with
 the European average of 18 per cent. Now, experts are calling for them 
to be banned from sale to youngsters.

In
 a paper last year, Dr Jack James, editor of the Journal of Caffeine 
Research, says caffeine should be regulated just like cigarettes and 
alcohol.

'Although caffeine 
has been widely considered to be benign, awareness is increasing that 
its consumption is associated with substantial harm, including 
fatalities and near-fatalities,' he wrote.

'How many caffeine-related fatalities and near-misses must there be before we regulate?'

In January month, a government adviser compared energy drinks with drugs, and urged schools to ban them.

Some schools have done so, with many teachers complaining the drinks affect behaviour and concentration.

And
 a 2011 study in America reported on a number of cases where excessive 
caffeine consumption in energy drinks had been associated with effects 
such as 'seizures, mania, stroke and sudden death'.

The
 researchers warned that high caffeine drinks were particularly risky 
for children with existing conditions such as heart arrhythmias, 
diabetes or mood and behavioural disorders, which may be undiagnosed.
