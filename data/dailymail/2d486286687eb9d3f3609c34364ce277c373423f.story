Families are spending almost £40 a week less than before the credit crunch and banking crash plunged the economy into crisis.

Rising unemployment, muted wage increases and the soaring price of everyday goods have left many struggling to make ends meet, according to official figures yesterday.

The gloomy statistics came as consumer experts Which? warned that four in ten Britons – equivalent to 20 million people – will spend less on Christmas this year.

Some are under so much financial pressure, they cannot even afford a tree.

Struggle: Many families are finding it difficult to make ends meet due to the soaring cost of everyday goods and rising unemployment

Latest figures from the Office for 
National Statistics showed that households spent a total of 
£210.7billion in the third quarter of this year, an average of £623 each
a week.

That was £39 
down on the £662 a week forked out in the third quarter of 2007. The 
weekly average for the same period last year was £633.

‘Households
continue to face difficult financial conditions, not least because 
inflation is over twice the rate of earnings growth,’ said the ONS 
report.

‘This, with an uncertain labour market, is continuing to weigh down on confidence.’

Admission: Paul Tucker has said that the Bank of England could have prevented the crippling rise in living costs, 'but chose not to'

Previously,
the Bank of England Governor Sir Mervyn King has said households face 
the biggest squeeze on their finances since the 1920s.

Weekly spending has plunged since the autumn of 2007, when Northern Rock suffered the first run on a British bank for 150 years.

It marked the start of the country’s worst financial crisis since the 1930s.

A
spokesman for campaign group Consumer Focus said: ‘Consumers are 
struggling on ever tighter budgets with rising energy bills, increases 
in food and fuel, higher inflation and the pressure to spend at 
Christmas adding to their anxiety.’

The bleak household spending figures 
were revealed as the ONS confirmed that the economy grew by 0.5 per cent
in the third quarter of the year.

But fears are rising the recovery is stalling and Britain is close to a double-dip recession.

The
stock market fell for a ninth day in a row in London yesterday, the 
second longest losing streak in the history of the FTSE 100.

The index edged 12.21 points lower to 5127.57, taking losses over the last nine days to £107billion.

This week, Sir Mervyn’s deputy, Paul Tucker, admitted that the Bank could have prevented the crippling rise in living costs ‘but chose not to’.

He said the situation ‘would have been worse’ if the Bank had increased interest rates.

The spending figures include the cost of everyday goods such as food and fuel as well as housing.

Homeowners have gained from low mortgages but rents have never been higher, pushing up bills for tenants.

Today’s report from Which? warns that 20million consumers will cut back this Christmas as the squeeze tightens.

Fears over finances are marring preparations for half of Britons and they are also worried about being able to keep children and relatives happy.

The consumer group urged against resorting to loans and credit cards to cope with the cost of the festive season.

Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘Christmas doesn’t have to be cancelled.

Savvy shoppers can save with online deals, discount days and pre-Christmas sales. Don’t be afraid to haggle.’

A separate study by BACS, which deals with electronic bank payments, suggests cost-cutting will continue in 2012.

Its analysis found people would be using online auction sites, such as eBay, switching to basic ranges in supermarkets and giving up a foreign holiday.

BACS suggested such steps could bring annual savings of £2,700.
