Just when it seemed West Ham’s bubble was about to burst and Mark Hughes would be handed three points on his birthday, Stewart Downing delivered two moments of quality to rescue a draw at Stoke.

Hughes saw his team produce their best football this season and take a deserved two-goal lead. Victor Moses opened his account for Stoke in a fine display and Diouf score his fourth goal of the season. But they failed to hold on as Sam Allardyce made the changes that extend his side’s unbeaten run to four.

While Stoke’s finishing ultimately cost them victory, their manager was furious at the decision by referee Chris Foy not to send off Alex Song as Enner Valencia scored to put West Ham back in the game.

Song dived in two-footed on Mame Biram Diouf and could have been dismissed but Downing broke with purpose and crossed brilliantly for the Ecuadorian to head home 22 seconds later.

Hughes said: ‘I’m really disappointed with their first goal. Song dived in two-footed. Thankfully Mame Biram jumped out of the way but the referee should have stopped the game. It was a dangerous challenge.

‘It was potentially a red card because Song was out of control. He (Foy) is one of our senior referees so he’s got to be better than that.’

Asked whether the decision might have been different were the offending player from Stoke, Hughes replied: ‘I can’t say that. I can think it, maybe.’

Downing scored the equaliser himself 17 minutes from time with a driven right-foot shot to prove it is now more than simply a leg to stand on.

Allardyce knew his side were fortunate to escape from the Britannia Stadium with a point.

‘I was glad it was only 1-0 at half-time,’ said Allardyce, whose team improved when Downing moved to the centre of midfield and Carlton Cole arrived from the bench to support Valencia up front.

‘That extra quality we’ve got this year paid dividends when it looked like we might not get a point. It was not necessarily well-deserved but shows the character of our team.’

West Ham slipped to fifth but maintain pace with the Champions League hunters in their best start since the 1999-2000 campaign.

They were shorn of their most potent weapon in Diafra Sakho, who scored in each of his last seven games but failed to recover from a shoulder injury.

Allardyce brought in Cheikhou Kouyate and left Valencia as his lone forward in a departure from the team that beat Manchester City last weekend. More cautious, it should have meant added stability in midfield but Stoke never allowed the visitors to settle.

Early in the game, Bojan whipped a low centre from the right that Diouf, two yards out, would have scored from had he made the merest touch and in the 33rd minute Stoke went ahead.

Sam Allardyce's West Ham side had won their previous three games, including one against Manchester City, but had to settle for a draw

Geoff Cameron was granted too much time and his cross was cleared only as far as Diouf, who laid it to Bojan in the box. James Collins failed to fully block his shot, allowing Moses to dive ahead of Carl Jenkinson and scramble the ball over the line.

To add to West Ham’s woes, Winston Reid was forced off with a thigh injury.

Stoke could have been two-up in injury time. Cameron flicked a cross that Diouf judged better than Collins, turning to bear down on West Ham keeper Adrian, who reacted brilliantly to divert the finish behind. Stoke did extend their lead 11 minutes after half time. Aaron Cresswell allowed Jon Walters to reach Marc Wilson’s cross-field ball, and was then beaten again by the Stoke winger as he delivered a perfect cross to Diouf, who applied the finishing header.

Stoke were rampant but the match turned shortly afterwards. Song went unpunished for his lunge and Downing beat Eric Pieters to race down the right. His deep cross was superb and Valencia headed in.

As the home crowd bristled, the match swung one way then another, before West Ham mounted the attack which brought them a point. Valencia picked up the ball on the left and delivered a low cross that travelled all the way to Downing, who struck a solid shot to beat Asmir Begovic.

Stoke could have restored their lead when Cameron stretched to reach Walters’ cross but Adrian stuck out a palm to save.

Foy failed to award a corner. Not the only thing he missed, Hughes would argue, frustrated his 51st birthday failed to end with a bang. ‘I’m getting old and we didn’t win so it’s not a good combination.’

‘That’s one of our most creative and dynamic performances this season. I’m delighted but we need to convert more of our chances.’

Stoke were rampant. On the other flank, Moses beat Jenkinson to race into the area before drilling his hot wide.

The match turned on shortly afterwards. Hughes was incensed when Song went unpunished for a reckless lunge on Diouf that eventually allowed Downing to beat Eric Pieters and race down the right.

His deep cross was superb, bypassing Stoke’s centre-backs, to provide Valencia with a straight-forward header back across and beyond the dive of Begovic.

As Hughes told the assistant referee nearby of his grievances, West Ham celebrated. The Stoke manager had a point, Song was lucky to stay on the pitch.

As the home crowd bristled the match swung one way then another, before West Ham mounted the attack which brought them a point.

Valencia picked up the ball on the left and managed to deliver a low cross that travelled all the way to Downing, who struck a solid shot that Begovic failed to keep out.

Stoke could have restored their lead in the closing stages when Cameron stretched to reach Walters’s cross but as the ball trickled goalwards Adrian stuck out a palm to save.

Foy failed to award a corner. Not the only thing he missed, Hughes will no doubt argue.
