No more skimping on your workouts at the gym.

A suit that promises to tell how hard you’ve work – or haven’t – has been developed by two students in Canada.

Named ‘Athos’, the full-body suit is equipped with tiny sensors that measure muscle output, heart rate and respiration.

Named 'Athos', the full-body suit is equipped with tiny sensors that measure muscle output, heart rate and respiration. The data is transmitted into a credit card-sized module called 'the core' that wirelessly syncs with an Athos software app

The Athos suit is embedded with tiny sensors that are able to measure a wearer's muscle output, heart rate and breathing rate.

The data provides users with a 'muscle effort' score so they know how much they are  pushing themselves.

At the same time, heart rate activity is registered so that users can get into the right heart rate zone to improve fitness.

The sensors ensure the users have balance by providing data on whether they are stretching and lifting evenly.

It will also track their reps and time spent working out.

As the wearer moves, electrical activity can be measured on the skin. This is then is converted into useful performance data.

The data is transmitted into a credit card-sized module called ‘The Core’ that wirelessly syncs with an Athos software app.

The app collects the information and gives users a way to track and understand their workouts.

For instance the data provides users with a 'muscle effort' score so they know how much they are pushing themselves.

At the same time, heart rate activity is registered so that users can get into the right heart rate zone to improve fitness.

 The sensors also ensure the users have balance by providing data on whether they are stretching and lifting evenly.

University of Waterloo students Dhananja Jayalath and Christopher Wiebe created the suit after being frustrated by their exercise routine.

Unable to afford a personal trainer, the electrical engineers put their heads together to come up with a way to get comprehensive data from their muscles as they worked out.

Up until now, measuring expended energy had required using small adhesive patches stuck all over the body.

The Athos suit, however, has sensors embedded in the compression suit fabric and doesn’t require any adhesives.

‘We've done extensive testing on very sweaty athletes and the sensors perform beautifully,’ said the creators.

Athos has been backed with $3.5 million in seed funding from Chamath Palihapitiya's Social+Capital Partnership.

Any piece of Athos clothing will set you back $99 (£60), and you’ll need another $199 (£121) for a core.

‘At launch we're planning to support any iOS device that is running iOS 7 and has Bluetooth 4.0,’ they added.

‘Right now that means we support the iPhone 4s and later, iPad 3 and later, iPod Touch 5, iPad mini.’

The first version, due for launch early next year, will have 14 muscle sensors and one pair for heart rate and breathing.
