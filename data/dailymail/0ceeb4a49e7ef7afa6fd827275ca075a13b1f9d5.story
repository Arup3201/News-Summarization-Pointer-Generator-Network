NASA’s Curiosity rover has been sitting in the same spot on Mars for several weeks carrying out the first X-ray analysis of soil from another planet.

However, the space agency has spent the last few days painstakingly taking 55 different pictures which it plans to stitch together to create a self portrait.

However, interest in the rover is so great that one amateur astronomer beat them to it.

Curiosity's latest self- portrait, stitched together by a space fan from raw images sent back by the rover

The image, above, combines 55 photos taken 
with the rover’s MAHLI camera, which sits outstretched on the end of 
Curiosity’s arm.

The probe moved the camera to different positions in 
each image so the arm isn’t visible.

Amateur astronomer and science 
writer Stuart Atkinson stitched together the raw images that Curiosity 
beamed back to Earth on Oct 31, tweeting the picture and telling followers 'It's just a sneaky peek in advance of the official image being released by the MSL guys.'

However, he admitted the best is yet to come - so far, the rover has only sent back the
 smaller, thumbnail versions of these images, with the full-sized ones 
arriving in the coming days.

NASA is then expected to produce its own version 
with the full resolution images.

The space agency has been making every image from Curiosity available to the public on a special web site, giving space fans an amazing insight into exactly what the rover is doing every day.

A selection of the 'raw' images that make up the self portrait

The rover has sent back several self portraits so far.

Engineers have been using the to check the rover's systems are operational.

They are also used to check its parts and moving correctly with barcodes on the rover that can be analysed to check it is the exact shape it should be.

Curiosity's last self portrait was a black and white landscape shot

This image shows a 'bite mark' where NASA's Curiosity rover scooped up some Martian soil.

The historic first scoop sample was taken from the 'Rocknest' patch of dust and sand on Oct. 7, 2012, the 61st sol, or Martian day, of operations.

A third scoop sample was collected on 
Oct. 15, or Sol 69, and deposited into the Chemistry and Mineralogy 
(CheMin) instrument on Oct. 17, or Sol 71. 

This image was taken by Curiosity's Mast
 Camera. Scientists enhanced the color in this version to show the 
Martian scene as it would appear under lighting conditions on Earth, 
which helps in analyzing the terrain. 

During the two-year prime mission of the
 Mars Science Laboratory Project, researchers are using Curiosity's 10 
instruments to investigate whether areas in Gale Crater ever offered 
environmental conditions favorable for microbial life.
