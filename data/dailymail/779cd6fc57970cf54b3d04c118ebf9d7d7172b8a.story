They make elegance look effortless when they step on to the red carpet.

Now Helen Mirren and Meryl Streep have been credited with inspiring older women to embrace more youthful fashion.

Next said its clothing sales have been boosted by older customers wanting to wear the latest trends and copy their celebrity role models’ ageless style.

It claimed women around the age of 60 are now choosing the same items as those aged 40 and under, as the generations become blurred.

Chief executive Lord Wolfson said that while older customers might once have shied away from certain styles, they no longer see their age as a barrier.

‘There is no longer the same fashion cut-off of a few years ago,’ he said. ‘I don’t think people nowadays think, “I can’t buy that”. Age is becoming less of a determining factor. As our business grows we are seeing more customers come in of different ages – and an increasing proportion don’t see their age as preventing them following trends.’

Meryl Streep made a bold choice for the 2012 Academy Awards, opting for a gold Lanvin dress with a plunging neckline, rivalling the fashion credentials of much younger stars like Hilary Swank

Fashion expert Gemma Champ said many women now stay physically active into their old age, meaning they have the confidence to carry off younger designs.

She added: ‘No one wants to dress like an old lady. 60-year-olds are not that old these days – they are young and fit and still working.

‘Many grew up in the 1960s and 1970s and had a good time. They are not ready to go into perms and blue rinses.’ She said that while the previous generation may have looked to their mothers for fashion advice, today’s older women are more likely to copy their daughters.

Lord Wolfson also revealed Next is planning a new fashion range, featuring dresses costing up to £150. Men’s suits will also be included, retailing at up to £300.

But he said this was a small range, and not a wider move upmarket for the chain.
