Heather Watson teamed up with Russia's Alexandra Panova to win the women's doubles title at the Baku Cup in Azerbaijan.

The British No 1 lost her opening singles match but finished the week on a winning note as she and Panova defeated third seeds Raluca Olaru and Shahar Peer 6-2 7-6 (7/3), saving two set points in the second set.

Watson has now won four titles on the WTA Tour, one in singles and three in doubles.
