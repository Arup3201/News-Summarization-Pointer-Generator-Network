A Dutch photographer was stunned to discover a mysterious flying vessel in the photos she took of a castle near Amsterdam.

Keen photographer Corinne Federer and her mother visited medieval Muiderslot castle last month and the 43-year-old decided to take some photos of the picturesque landmark.

She was using High Dynamic Range, or HDR, images, where three or more pictures are taken at the same time and then overlapped for a rich image with the full spectrum of light.

I want to believe: The high speed winged object snapped by Corinne Federer over Muiderslot Castle in Holland

As she checked the pictures, she was amazed to find that one of the images, comprised of five overlapped images, featured a 'tubular-shaped object that had an S-shaped fin on it.'

She told the Huffington Post: 'We heard nothing, it was completely quiet out. The more I flipped through the frames, it was kind of creepy.'

'I've been shooting for quite some time and I've seen other stuff in the news, but I've never seen anything [like this] with my own eye.'

She added that the object was blurred at 1/250th of a second and was not in the frame before or after, so it had to be going incredibly fast.

This is the same image, but after adjustments were made to the contrast to provide a clearer sense of the shape of the 'UFO'

Through further tweaking of the photos she found that in the image following the appearance of the UFO on the right side, there was a portion of another object but on the left side of the exposure, giving the appearance that the 'craft' had turned around at breathtaking speed.

Ben Hansen, a former FBI special agent who has used his investigative skills to analyse thousands of videos and photographs of alleged UFO sightings said the images do not appear to have been manipulated.

He said: 'The object's appearance is internally consistent with the rest of the photo. For instance, look at the darker area of the underside of the object compared with the clouds.

'Having the sun in the frame is helpful because it indicates where shadows should appear. This further supports that the object was photographed 'in-camera' and not added later.'

However, he does not agree that the object appears to have doubled back on itself and speculates that it's probably a insect as the 'fins' could easily be wing protrusions.

But while Federer isn't sure what she photographed over the Muiderslot Castle that day, she still looks up at the night sky and thinks there must be someone - or thing - out there.
