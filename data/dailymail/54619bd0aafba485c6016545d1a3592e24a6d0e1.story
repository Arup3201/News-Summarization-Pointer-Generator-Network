As a boy Nick Clegg attended £30,000-a-year Westminster School, one of the most prestigious in the country.

But his wife Miriam Gonzalez is unimpressed, revealing many people who go to the country’s top schools are ‘unimpressive’ and some are ‘absolutely hopeless’.

In a rare interview, she insisted that success does not depend on having wealthy and bright parents or an expensive education but on effort and determination.

Advice: Miriam Gonzales told girls from Basildon Upper School in Essex that going to a top school did not ensure success

The Deputy Prime Minister was nicknamed Clog by classmates at Westminster School classmates because his mother was Dutch.

He has spoken of enjoying his time at the exclusive school, where former pupils also include singer Dido, actress Helena Bonham Carter, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and broadcaster Louis Theroux.

However, Miss Gonzalez, a partner at global law firm Dechert, insists going to a top school is not a prerequisite for success and many who do struggle in the real world.

Speaking to pupils at a National Inspiring Women campaign event, she said: ‘I come from a state education and what I have seen myself in life, whether you are looking at schools or groups of people or organisations, is that there is probably always the same proportion of absolutely amazing people, absolutely hopeless people and a lot of people in the middle.

‘That’s what we are trying to work on, that very simple concept that confidence should be linked to ability, not to your position in society,’ she told The Times.

Born in Spain, Miss Gonzalez grew up in the Valladolid region and attend what she describes as ‘not a particularly good school’.

She later told the pupils:  ‘Some people from some of these top schools are fantastic but there are lots of people from these top schools who are unimpressive.

‘I know far too many that come out of there without speaking a single foreign language.

‘It doesn’t depend on your school, it doesn’t depend on your parents, it depends on you, how much effort and determination you are prepared to put in.’

Nick Clegg attended Westminster school in the 1980s, a short walk from the Houses of Parliament

Her advice to the girls was to ‘aim high, work as much as you can to get there and if at any point you wobble and you are not really sure if you are made for this, think of those women you have met today’.

Old school friends of Mr Clegg say he was not a high fliwer.

Harry Mount said last year: ‘Nick Clegg wasn’t one of the more intelligent boys when he was at Westminster School from 1980 to 1985.

‘The clever pupils at Westminster — one of the best, and most expensive, schools in the country, costing £32,490 a year — were ‘accelerated’. That meant they did O-levels after two, as opposed to three, years.

‘Clegg, one of the less bright sparks, was selected for the three-year option.’
