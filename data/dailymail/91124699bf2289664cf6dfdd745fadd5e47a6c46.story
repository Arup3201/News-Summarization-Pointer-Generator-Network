This terrifying photograph shows the venomous huntsman spider that jumped out of a charity worker’s backpack when she returned to the UK.

Nora Serrat, 32, found the spider with a huge egg sac – containing up to 400 babies – after coming back to London from a two-week charity trip to the Cameroonian rainforest.

The spider, which is known to prey on scorpions and even bats, was described by a member of the charity, the Rainforest Foundation UK, as ‘feisty’.

This is the giant venomous spider that a charity worker accidentally brought to the UK from Cameroon

According to the Evening Standard, Ms Serrat discovered the spider when she was unpacking from the trip.

The charity worker said she believes the spider crawled into her sleeping mat in the rainforest.

She told the paper: ‘It's not an impossible thing to happen considering the places we visited - but it was still a bit of a surprise.’

Ms Serrat, who specialises in mapping and forest governance for the charity, said colleagues caught the huntsman in a carton box after discovering it.

They found it using a cardboard box in the charity’s Camden office.

The charity staff then contacted the Zoological Society of London for them to take the creature of their hands.

Rachel Agnew, of the charity, told the Evening Standard that no harm appeared to have come to the spider, which when they dropped it off appeared ‘alive and apparently quite feisty’.

Native to the tropical regions of the world, the Heteropoda venatoria is a species of the Sparassidae, or huntsman, spiders.

Its body can grow to 2.8cm in length and the female produces an egg sac of around 2.5cm wide, which can carry up to 400 eggs.

The spiders prey of insects, scorpions and even bats.

It is sensitive to the cold, and can only live outside in certain climates.
