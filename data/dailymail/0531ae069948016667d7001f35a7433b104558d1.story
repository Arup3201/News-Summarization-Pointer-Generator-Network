A farmer has claimed his chickens lay more eggs when he plays them soothing operatic music.

Steve Ledsham, 64, says egg production soared when he started playing the hits of Andrew Lloyd Webber within earshot of his 24 hens while building a barn at his farm in Wirral, Merseyside.

When Mr Ledsham went to collect eggs shortly afterwards, he noticed there were around double the number he had expected to find.

He says the dramatic increase, which saw the hens raise their output from four to eight eggs a week each, is all down to his taste for the classic songs of musical theatre.

Mr Ledsham, who has worked on the farm for 20 years, said: ‘We were building a barn at the time so we always had music playing in the background.’

He added: ‘While building it we noticed the hens were laying more eggs and we put two and two together and realised it was because of the music.’

Mr Ledsham claims his hens only 
appreciate certain kinds of music however, adding that he doubts ‘modern
 chart rubbish’ by the likes of One Direction or Miley Cyrus would have 
had such a positive impact.

He
 said: ‘I'm not really a fan of new music and I don't think the chickens
 will be either so I'll stick to the traditional stuff.’

Mr Ledsham, who won The Soil Association's best organic farm shop in 2005, believes the main reason the hens are producing more eggs is because the music makes them more relaxed and happy.

‘Happy animals produce better goods so by playing some soothing opera classics they are able to relax a lot more than they usually would,’ he says.

Mr Ledsham isn’t the first farmer to claim exposure to classical music has a positive effect on his chickens.

In 2008 Charles Bourns - a farmer in Gloucester - claimed his 70,000 chickens reacted positively to the soothing strains of Classic FM.

He told Farmers Weekly that, despite experimenting with pop music, he found Classic FM worked best as it has fewer dramatic tempo changes and there was less talking between songs.

In 2011 a farm in Hong Kong’s New Territories conducted an experiment in which 20,000 chickens were played a mixture of classical, rap, pop and jazz.

The results suggested that the hens were not particularly bothered by the different genres and would simply lay more eggs as long as there was a consistent rhythm drowning out any stress-inducing background noise.

The theory has been backed by experts who say music can have a calming influence on animals.

John Widdowson, Vice Chairman of the 
Free Range Egg Producers Association, said: ‘A lot of people play music 
to chickens as a way of helping them to relax… It's a good idea because 
it blocks out any background noises which are prone to upset them.’

He added: ‘But I don't know why they would prefer a specific type of music, they must be very cultured chickens.’

Top technique: The hens produce more eggs because the music relaxes them

Mr Ledsham is happy in role as an egg pioneer, and hopes more farmers follow his example and begin experimenting with music.

He says: ‘I'm thrilled that it has worked and I'm pretty sure a few more farmers across the country are doing it now as well’.
