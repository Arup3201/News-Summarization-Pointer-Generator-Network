A man in Providence, Rhode Island got the fright of a lifetime this week when he went to use his friend's bathroom and the restroom exploded. 

Neurosurgeon Jeffrey Oppenheim of New York was visiting his friend Andrew Pessin on Sunday when he went to use the first floor bathroom just 10 minutes after arriving.

Oppenheim says he heard a strange clicking noise - like a pilot light igniting - in the lavatory just second before a mysterious combustive force through him out of the room and into the kitchen.

What happened? A man in Providence, Rhode Island was injured this weekend when a blast ripped through his friend's bathroom

Rattling: Jeffrey Oppenheim (pictured) was visiting his friend Andrew Pessin in Rhode Island when he went to use the bathroom and it exploded

 Strange noise: Oppenheim recalls hearing a clicking noise just before the explosion on Sunday 

'It happened in an instant like getting hit by a cannon,' Oppenheim told WLNE. 

His friend Pessin was sitting down in the kitchen with his three sons when he caught wind of a burning smell and immediately carried his children to safety and called 911. 

'Oh it was horrible they were petrified screaming standing in the snow screaming, barefoot,' Pessin said of his 9, 7, and 5-year-old sons. 

Oppenheim told Daily Mail Online that it's believed a gas leak sparked the blast. 

Authorities allegedly told his friend that gas may have leaked in from outside the house, and that it can lose it's rotten egg odor (caused by added mercaptan) if it passes up through the ground. 

Mystery: Authorities are still investigating the cause of the mysterious blast. Workers for gas company National Grid were seen looking around the house on Sunday

Safe and sound: Besides bruising to Oppenheim's leg, no one else was injured in the incident 

Everyone got out of the house safely, though Oppenheim did suffer a bruised knee in the blast.  

'I'm just very grateful it was me in there and not one of the Pessin children who are little. They could have gotten killed,' Oppenheim said

'I'm very, very, very lucky,' Oppenheim told Daily Mail Online, adding that he was able to drive back to New York that very day and didn't need to take a break from performing surgery.  

Authorities continue to investigate the cause of the blast, which remains a mystery. 

Reporters on the scene on Sunday said workers from gas company National Grid were surveying the house.

Unfortunately, the Pessin family is facing the possibility that the house could be condemned, according to Oppenheim. 

He says they have been staying in a hotel, and have signed a lease on an apartment in the meantime.
