Paul Scholes believes Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard should stick to playing in front of the back four rather than in a more advanced role.

The Anfield skipper has struggled to find his best form this campaign having missed out the Premier League title last season.

And Scholes also expects Gerrard to see out his career at Liverpool.

Steven Gerrard has struggled to capture his best form this season after missing out on the title in May

Gerrard did manage to get on the scoresheet in Liverpool's win over Leicester on Tuesday

Writing in his Independent column, he said: 'For all the debate over where Steven Gerrard plays out his days at Liverpool, I do not see his role as anything other than a holding midfielder. 

'Playing in that No 10 playmaker role can be very difficult in your thirties. There is always a danger the game can pass you by, especially if the midfield behind you are not at the very top of their game.

'It seems natural to me that Gerrard would stay at Liverpool for the rest of his career. The time to move, if ever, was a decade ago when he would have had a better chance of winning a league title elsewhere, most likely Chelsea.'

Scholes' view differs from that of former Liverpool assistant Steve Clark, however.

He told talkSPORT: 'Gerrard is a top player. 'He is not in the same condition he was 10 years ago but he still has the quality to influence a game and the position he played against Leicester, a little bit closer to the striker, is probably the position he enjoys the most and he'll always score goals from that position.

'He still has the legs to play in that position and I think that's where he enjoys playing the most.

'Liverpool were a different team last year with (Luis) Suarez and (Daniel) Sturridge up front and they could afford to drop Gerrard a little deeper, but they've got a different team now and I think they'll get more out of him by playing him a bit further forward.'
