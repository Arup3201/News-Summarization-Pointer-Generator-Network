Bored of painting your nails and looking for a solution that's both chip-free and funky?

Then look no further than this 3D nail art created by New York digital artists Sarah C. Awad and Dhemerae Ford.

The pair operate under the name The Laser Girls and show off their fun and unusual nail art on their Tumblr page.

Work of art: The 3D nails have been designed by digital artists Sarah C. Awad and Dhemerae Ford

From the computer your your fingertips: They bring their designs to life with a 3D printer using materials including plastic and brass

Get the look: The stick-on designs can be purchased from shapeways.com and should stay on for around three days

They design the innovative press on nails on the computer and then bring them to life with a 3D printer from materials including plastic and brass.

Their creations have been on display this month at the Museum of Art and Design in New York and have created such a buzz, they are now on sale via the website shapeways.com.

For a special occasion: Another design features a more intricate pattern

Creative: The design duo print off the nail designs and also create jewellery such as rings

The nails are adequately shaped to fit the thumb to little finger

They also come in an array of colours and cost £5 to £30 depending on the design

Prices range from £5 to £30 depending on the style and materials used.

The sellers describe the nails as 'ideal for special events, costumes, and any short-term occasion' as they are not designed for extended wear. Once applied with a thin layer of glue, they should stay on for around three days if care is taken to look after them.

The Laser Girls say they are 'overwhelmed' by the response they have had so far to their product and even count The Help actress Emma Stone as a fan.

As well as nails, the duo also create jewellery including rings.
