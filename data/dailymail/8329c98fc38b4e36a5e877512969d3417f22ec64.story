If you don't believe in climate change, you're less likely to feel that the weather is getting warmer - and vice versa.

That's according to a study that analysed how people remembered a particularly warm winter in the US in 2012.

And they found those who believed in climate change remembered it being warmer, while those who didn't thought it was colder.

US researchers say political beliefs affect our view on the weather. They studied perceptions of the anomalously warm US winter in 2012 (Times Square shown). Democrats and women remembered the winter as being warmer. But Republicans and men said that it was colder than it was

The research, published in Nature Climate Change, was carried out by three US sociologists - , Dr Aaron McCright of Michigan State University, Dr Riley Dunlap of Oklahoma State, and Dr Chenyang Xiao of American University.

They studied how people remembered the erroneously warm winter of 2012, which was the fourth warmest on record for the US of the previous 117 winters.

A report from the World Bank Group recently claimed that the world must brace itself for more extreme weather, as it is locked on a path to unstoppable warming.

They said some effects of climate change will be unavoidable owing to past and predicted emissions from power plants, factories and cars.

But they added the worst impacts could be avoided by cutting global emissions.

The report, entitled 'Turn down the Heat: Confronting the New Climate Normal', stated that the average temperature on Earth will be 1.5°C (2.7°F) above pre-industrial levels by 2050.

Sea levels will also continue to rise as the vast ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica thaw slowly, they said. 

During the winter, the seasonal average was about 1.9°C (3.9°F) above the 20th century average.

The researchers compared data from Gallup polls in early March 2012 after the winter ended with temperature data from the US, reports the Washington Post.

Most correctly said that the weather had been unusual, with those in more affected areas noticing the conditions more.

But those with certain political and scientific beliefs had differing views on how severe the changes had been.

'Democrats [were] more likely than Republicans to perceive local winter temperatures as warmer than usual,' the researchers wrote.

Liberals and women were also more likely than conservatives and males to attribute the warmer-than-normal local winter temperatures to global warming.

The results suggest that, apart from actual science, people's view on climate change can be skewed by their beliefs.

And as the climate has the potential to become more out-of-tune with normality in the coming years, the researchers warn it will be harder and harder to convince people on global warming.

For example, they say, climate change not only drives warmer weather but also cold extremes owing to increased vapour in the atmosphere.

'If you can't reach the committed conservatives on the fact that a significantly warmer season might be due to anthropogenic [human-caused] global warming, I think it's going to be really hard to convince them that the current situation is due to anthropogenic climate change,' study co-author Riley Dunlap told the Washington Post.' 

The results were also consistent with people's beliefs on global warming (stock image shown). And the researchers warn it will be difficult to convince people the climate is changing due to human activity as it becomes more wild, with both colder and warmer spells expected
