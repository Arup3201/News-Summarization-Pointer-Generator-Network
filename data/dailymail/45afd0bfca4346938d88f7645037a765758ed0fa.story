Mark Lancaster (above), 40, preyed on the vulnerable women by setting up scam website Sponsor A Scholar in the hope of seeking out 'cheap sex' and fulfilling his 'sordid fantasies'

A ‘creepy’ computer geek who posed as an academic to dupe needy students into having sex with him on camera in exchange for bogus £15,000 scholarships has today been jailed for 16 months.

Mark Lancaster, 40, preyed on the vulnerable women by setting up scam website Sponsor A Scholar in the hope of seeking out ‘cheap sex’ and fulfilling his ‘sordid fantasies’.

The explicit website offered to put students in touch with potential ‘sponsors’ who would pay their tuition fees in exchange for sex.

Girls were told they would be rewarded with higher sums of money if they undertook ‘more unusual’ sex acts, Southwark Crown Court heard.

Lancaster gained their trust by pretending to be a respected academic before luring them to ‘interviews’ at a private rented apartment in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.

During one ‘practical assessment’ last September, an 18-year-girl was provided with a schoolgirl outfit and high heels before Lancaster asked her to pose for photographs, telling her: ‘The golden rule is the sexier you look in the pictures, the bigger scholarship amount you can get.’

The teenager, who is now 19, said she felt ‘no option’ but to have sex with Lancaster, filmed by secret cameras hidden in the ceiling and corners of his bedroom and bathroom.

The Kenyan national went through with sex with him to avoid burdening her single mother with the cost of her studies, describing how she felt ‘gross’ afterwards.

But she was later told by Lancaster that she had failed the assessment but had another opportunity to ‘try again’.

Lancaster was working as a computer contractor for the Foreign Commonwealth Office at the time of the offences and in the past has been employed by IBM, Fujitsu and the Ministry of Defence.

The pervert was exposed following undercover investigations by Channel Four News and the Independent newspaper.

‘He was accomplished in the use of computers and computer technology and set up a website called Sponsor A Scholar, the purpose of which was targeting vulnerable female students seeking funding for their education, principally at university level,’ said prosecutor Lisa Wilding.

‘The defendant would be the assessor and they (girls) would be required to have sex with him so he could determine whether they were suitable for a sponsor.

‘There were no sponsors and no scholarships and the entire elaborate plan was concocted by this defendant purely for his own sexual gratification.

‘Thanks must be offered to the journalists because it was through investigative journalism that the defendant was revealed and his activities and the website were brought to an end.’

Judge Peter Testar described Lancaster’s activities as a 'pitiless deception'.

‘For the purpose of obtaining sexual gratification, you set up a complex scam. What was involved was offering to put needy young women in touch with so called sponsors who would pay them up to £15,000 a year.

‘It’s plain, as the complainant acknowledged, that what was expected of the young women who responded to the advert on your website was they should provide sexual services.

‘A lot of organisation went into this - the setting up of the website, the arrangement of accommodation and the fitting out of that accommodation with concealed cameras.

‘The complainant concedes frankly when she saw the website that she realised perfectly well what would be expected of her, were she to be given the sponsorship, was sexual services.

‘You led her to believe this was a stepping stone on to a sponsorship.

‘This was an elaborate lie and a thoroughgoing and pitiless deception.

‘The appropriate sentence is one of 16 months' imprisonment and it would be quite wrong to suspend that.’

Wearing a dark suit, white striped shirt and blue patterned tie, Lancaster stared straight ahead throughout the entire hearing and remained expressionless as he was led out of the dock.

Patrick Harte, defending Lancaster, conceded his behaviour was ‘incredibly creepy’ and in pursuit of his ‘sordid fantasies’, adding: ‘It was cheap sex he was looking for and that’s what he thought he got.

‘He is devastated by the effect he has had on the victim. He did know the filming was wrong and he has no desire to blame the victim.

‘As she said, it was a scumbag of a thing for him to do.

While Lancaster’s wife has forgiven him, he has been ‘blacklisted’ by former colleagues in the technology industry and is now unemployed with little prospect of finding work.

‘It is a very unpleasant mess’, Mr Harte added.

Lancaster, of Waterlooville, Hampshire, admitted voyeurism and sex trafficking.

He must also sign the Sex Offenders' Register for ten years.
