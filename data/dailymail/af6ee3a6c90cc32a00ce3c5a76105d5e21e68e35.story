Tragedy: Chandler Weems 14, died after being hit by a police patrol car in Henry County, Georgia

A 14-year-old boy has died after being hit by a police patrol car while out riding his bike with friends.

Chandler Weems was struck by the cruiser near his home in Henry County, Georgia, as he exited a driveway onto a main road.

The teenager was taken to a hospital in the Atlanta area after the accident on Saturday, but died yesterday.

He was hit directly outside witness Ron Jackson's house, who described him as a 'sweet kid,' during an interview with Fox News.

Mr Jackson said he ran from his home to help after hearing a police officer calling for assistance.

'I came running up to the front once I heard somebody scream for help,' he said.

'When I got to the front porch that's when I saw the officer in the road.'

The teenager is believed to have been leading a group of friends on bikes to another friend's home when the accident happened.

His best friend Bryce Hatmaker said he had yelled at Chandler to stop as he approached the main road.

'When he saw the car he tried to stop but it was too late,' he told Wsbtv.com.

The dead teenager was known to love riding his bike.

The car was reportedly being driven by police officer Denise Allyson Romano, 35, and traveling north on North Ola Road.

She was said to be 'distraught' following the incident, according to Fox News.

Henry County police Sgt Joey Smith told the Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution the officer 'could not avoid the accident.'
