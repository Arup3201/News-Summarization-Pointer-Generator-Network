President Barack Obama's re-election campaign plans to release a 17-minute documentary next week about his first term in office.

The Road We've Traveled will be released on March 15, but until then, the campaign has unveiled a snippet of the film as a trailer on YouTube.

The film is narrated by actor and director Tom Hanks.

Chronicle: The Road We've Traveled, which chronicles the four years of Obama's presidency, will be released on March 15

The trailer opens with the Saving Private Ryan star asking: 'How do we understand this president and his time in office?

'Do we look at the day’s headlines, or do we remember what we as a country have been through?'

This appears to be an attempt to redefine Mr Obama as a historic President faced with unique challenges, rather than taking a short-term view of the ailing economy and high unemployment.

The film will chronicle major struggles of Mr Obama's four years in office, including the economic crisis, ObamaCare, the auto industry bailout and the mission that took
out Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.

Despair: Republicans have criticised the video, which they say whitewashes the President's record

Featured in the film, according to 
the trailer, are Vice President Joe Biden, former advisers David Axelrod
and Austan Goolsbee and former Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel.

Obama campaign manager Jim Messina said the documentary was directed by Davis Guggenheim, whose credits include the Oscar-winner An Inconvenient Truth, about Al Gore's global-warming campaign.

Messina says the documentary will, in his words, 'put into perspective the enormous challenges that the nation faced when the president took office and the strides we've made together.'

Campaigns frequently release documentary films to reach voters and amplify the narrative of a candidate's message. 

Campaigning: The video will be shown at election events over the next few months

However, few election films have the pedigree of this one, which is directed by one Oscar-winner and narrated by another.

It will be shown at Obama campaign stops across the country, but not everyone's impressed - Republicans have been speaking out against the footage.

GOP spokesperson Kirsten Kukowski told USA Today: 'Americans don't need a movie to learn about the president's record.

She added: 'Unfortunately Americans feel Obama's accomplishments each and every day after President Obama led our country to higher unemployment, record debt, and higher gas prices'.

Tense: One of the events chronicled in The Road We've Traveled is Obama's decision to OK the mission that took out Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden

Milestones: The film is directed by Davis Guggenheim and will feature Obama's achievements while in office, including health care reform

A spokesman for the Republican National Committee was also sceptical of Mr Obama's latest campaign gambit.

'In 2008, he did a 30-minute infomercial to talk about what he would do as president, and it seems somewhat ironic that four years later he has to stretch a 17-minute video to say what he's done,' the spokesman said.

'As well done as it is, even the best Hollywood studio effects can't cover up the failed policies of the last three years.'

The film is reminiscent of The Man From Hope, a film about Bill Clinton made by TV producers Harry Thomason and Linda Bloodworth-Thomason at the time of the 1992 election.
