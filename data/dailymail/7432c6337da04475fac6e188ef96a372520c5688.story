A long-serving BBC presenter who quit the Corporation claiming there was a 'poisonous atmosphere' of bullying has been awarded a cash payout from bosses.

Suzanne Virdee, who hosted the popular evening news programme Midlands Today, walked out after 11-years at the BBC last March.

She later lodged a claim for an employment tribunal suing the BBC over the alleged bullying.But the tribunal has now been dropped after she accepted a financial payout from the BBC.

It is understood a confidentiality clause has been agreed preventing any details emerging of the payout.

Virdee quit last year announcing that she would not be signing a new five-month contract because of what she had called 'circumstances beyond my control.'

The National Union of Journalists later issued a statement deploring the BBC's treatment of the presenter.

A spokesperson said at the time: 'This chapel deeply regrets the fact the BBC could not reach agreement with Suzanne Virdee over the continuation of her contract.

'We feel we are losing a first-class presenter and a valued colleague.

'We deplore the way she was treated by the BBC management over a considerable period of time but the decision not to allow her to present the programme and say goodbye after 11 years at Midlands Today is nothing short of disgrace.'

Former Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly left the BBC to help women facing discrimination

A BBC spokeswoman said: 'The BBC does not comment on individual cases but any accusations of bullying are taken very seriously.'

The payout comes three months after BBC radio journalist Russell Joslin, 50, killed himself after claiming bosses ignored his pleas for help when he was allegedly sexually harassed by a female colleague.

Miriam O'Reilly left the BBC to launch a support service for women facing discrimination in the workplace, a year after her own ageism tribunal victory against the Corporation.

The former Countryfile presenter is thought to have received a six-figure payout following the verdict in 2011.

Miss O’Reilly, 54, was one of four women presenters in their 40s and 50s who were removed from BBC1 rural affairs show Countryfile in 2009, when the show was being revamped for peak time.

In the landmark ruling the BBC was accused of being obsessed with attracting younger viewers and of ‘social engineering’ for sacking her because she was seen as too old.
