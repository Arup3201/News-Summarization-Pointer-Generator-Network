Ukrainian blonde: Mother-of-one Anna Avramenko, 25, who canoe conman John Darwin met up with on Saturday night

Canoe fraudster John Darwin is up the creek again after a failed effort to find a Ukrainian bride.

The 63-year-old has been dumped by a woman less than half his age who labelled him a ‘sex-starved criminal’.

Darwin, who is on parole from prison, travelled to Ukraine to go on a date with Anna Avramenko, 25, after they met through a foreign brides website for women seeking a rich husband.

But she says she never wants to see him again after she found out that he can expect to be jailed when he returns to Britain.

Darwin broke the conditions of his parole by travelling the 1,700 miles from his home in Hartlepool to visit her in the industrial town of Sumy.

He was jailed in 2008 for faking his death and fraudulently claiming £500,000 in insurance money with his then wife Anne, 61.

Yesterday Miss Avramenko, whom he met for dinner on Saturday evening, said she did not know he was a criminal.

The tall blonde said she agreed to meet Darwin after he bombarded her with sleazy messages, which included boasts that he could ‘satisfy any woman’ and requests for a threesome.

He boasted that hundreds of women wanted to meet up with him and claimed he had received 240 messages in one day, she said.

Miss Avramenko, who has a six-year-old daughter, said that during their three-month email exchange, Darwin told her that one of his favourite hobbies was kayaking.

He also allegedly tried to persuade her to sleep with him by saying Westerners often have sex on the first date. When they met, he kept encouraging her to come to his room to drink champagne.

But she took him to dinner with two of her friends instead and went to him with a bar afterwards as he again pestered her to come back to his room.

She told The Sun: ‘When John first wrote to me it was just general chatting, but later he started sending more private letters, some of which were inappropriate, too sexy – even embarrassing.

‘He kept mentioning that he can satisfy any girl and claimed that his first sexual experience was when he was eight with an older woman.

‘Some of his messages were disgusting. I only eventually agreed to meet him because he was so persistent.

‘But I regret going to see him because he was just interested in trying to have sex with me.

‘I didn’t know about him being in jail. I would never have met him if I knew.’ 

Darwin, whose marriage ended in divorce after he and his wife were jailed, told Miss Avramenko he wanted to remarry and live abroad.

‘I’m looking for a wife, not simply a hot date with you or any other girl on this site,’ he said.

When confronted by a reporter during their date, Darwin said he had a migraine.

Told that it was likely the 
authorities would want to question him on his return to Britain, he 
replied: ‘Well, I’ll have an even bigger headache then.’ 

It is understood that a warrant will be issued so he will face arrest as soon as he returns.

Darwin was declared dead in 2003, a year after apparently drowning on a canoe trip.

His
 family claimed £500,000 in insurance money, yet all the while he was 
living in a hidden part of the home he shared with his wife.

The
 swindle deceived the police, a coroner, a number of financial 
institutions and even their sons Mark and Anthony. The pair eventually 
moved to Panama, planning to start a new life with their money.

But in December 2007 Darwin walked into a London police station claiming he had amnesia.

He was jailed for six years and three months but released in 2011.

He now lives in a £100,000 bungalow in Seaton Carew, near Hartlepool, and survives on a pension of £138 a week.

It
 is unclear which travel documents he used to visit Ukraine as it was 
thought his passport was not due to be returned to him until next March.

Under
 the terms of his early prison release on licence, Darwin is not allowed
 to leave the UK without Probation Service permission.

The
 Ministry of Justice has advised that offenders who breach the terms of 
their licence will be returned to prison to serve the rest of their 
sentence.

A spokesman said:
 ‘Any offender subject to licence supervision is required to gain 
permission from probation to travel outside of the UK. Permission is 
only granted in exceptional circumstances.

‘Any
 offender who travels without this permission will be subject to recall 
to custody. In these circumstances, the Probation Service works closely 
with the police to implement the recall.’
