Entertainment reporter Peter Ford has spoken out in defence of his controversial tweet in which he slammed Chrissie Swan for leaving her one-year-old baby at home to appear on a reality show.

MIX FM DJ Chrissie, who is currently the favourite to take out the crown on the channel 10 show I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, has been in the South African jungle for the past six weeks, leaving her three children in Australia with their father Chris Saville.

Radio personality Ford came under fire for what some Twitter users have called a 'sexist' tweet, but he has hit back, telling Daily Mail Australia he was not trying to 'mummy shame' Swan but believes she has a choice to leave the jungle whenever she wants.

Entertainment whiz Ford claimed that the 41-year-old radio and television personality is 'chasing fame' by taking part in the show and has expressed his doubts over what it says about today's society.  

'Chrissie’s children are out there. She very happily uses them and talks about them all the time,' Ford told Daily Mail Australia. 

'I'm uncomfortable talking about her children, or any children underage but she happily uses them and talks about them so she’s made them public property.'

Ford, who can be heard every morning on 6PR radio talking about all things celebrity, certainly didn't hold back when he sent  the controversial tweet out to his 8,700 followers.

'Chrissie Swan looks set to win Celeb. Not sure what it says about society that we reward a mother who leaves a 1 year old baby to chase fame,' the tweet said.

While some Twitter users were quick to point out that Freddie Flintoff and Merv Hughes also have children at home who they left behind, Ford said they haven't been crying about it on national TV. 

'But we haven’t seen the men crying on camera about missing their children and none of them have a child who are one-year-old,' he said. 

'Chrissie is free to leave whenever she wants but she's chosen to stay in there because obviously if she leaves she forfeits the money.'

'I never judged her, I'm not mummy shaming her, all I said was I couldn't do it. 

'She must have more resilience and strength of character than I have but suddenly I've become the poster boy for the most hated man in Australia,' Ford said. 

Swan has made it down to the final three contestants on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here

Swan has three children - one-year-old Peggy, three-year-old Kit and seven-year-old Leo. On numerous occasions, the much-loved personality has expressed on air that she misses her children.

She has been slammed in the past for smoking throughout her most recent pregnancy and burst out crying on I'm A Celebrity when telling her fellow camp that she missed her son Kit's first day of preschool. 

She also revealed on the show that Kit had a hearing impairment for the first few years of his life, leaving him unable to say 'mum'.

Immediately after Ford sent out the tweet, a plethora of angry responses flooded hisTwitter feed, with many claiming ford, whose bio says he is the 'best informed entertainment correspondent in Australia', was taking a 'cheap shot' at the reality star.

'You had a cheap shot at her character by saying she's chasing fame,' one Twitter user said.

'Perhaps, just perhaps @ChrissieSwan is doing the show to feed her family?' another commenter said.

Ford has been questioning Chrissie's involvement in the show since the opening night. 

On January 31st, the night I'm A Celebrity debuted in Australia, Ford tweeted: 'Finally that recurring title attached to Chrissie as one of Australia's most loved stars will be put to the test. Time will tell.'

After a barrage of abuse from angry Chrissie Swan fans, Ford said it was simply his opinion that Chrissie should not have left her children at home to take part in the show. 

The reality star recently confessed on the show that she believes she's shed an impressive ten kilos during her stint in the jungle.

Ford has let his opinions on Chrissie be known to his Twitter followers 

Chrissie Swan recently revealed that she's lost 10kg in the jungle  

'She can do whatever she wants. I simply said I couldn't do it . She must be stronger & wiser than me,' he said. 

Chrissie has made it down to the final three on I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here. The final will air on Sunday night and Chrissie is hotly tipped to win and be crowned queen of the jungle. 

If she wins, her nominated charity, CARE Australia, are set to receive $100,000.
