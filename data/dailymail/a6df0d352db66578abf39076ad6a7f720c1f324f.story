He's strutted his stuff on the catwalk wearing everything from wedding dresses to transparent T-shirts and now Andrej Pejic can add onesies to the list.

The androgynous Bosnian-Australian model sported a clinging onesie on the catwalk during Jean Paul Gaultier's show at Paris Menswear last night.

Although Pejic is famous for being the world's only male model to specialise in womenswear, that hasn't stopped him from taking part in the continuing round of menswear shows.

Multi-talented: Although Pejic usually focuses on womenswear, here he proves he can turn his hand to both

Wearing masculine suits, trousers and shirts - as well as that onesie -Â  the model has already appeared on the runway at Jean Paul Gaultier and Yohji Yamamoto, with three more days of Paris Menswear left to go.

Barefaced and with his long, blond hair slicked back, the model looked far more manly than usual.

He even sported a super-sized moustache during the Yohji Yamamoto show, which left him almost unrecognisable.

Despite his foray into menswear, Pejic remains a favourite of womenswear designers, having starred in multiple campaigns, including for Marc Jacobs womenswear.

It was recently revealed that the model's envy-inducing bone structure was inherited from his mother, whose photograph he posted on his Twitter account last week.

The 1970s image showed a blonde, slender woman with the same fine features as her son.

Thanks goodness for excellent genes.
