Now that September is in full swing, I thought it was about time for a serious skincare shuffle. 

Although I do stay loyal to certain skincare products, being the beauty junkie I am means it’s difficult not to be tempted by the plethora of new releases.

The long, sun-soaked days of the summer months have left my skin feeling a little dry and lacklustre, so I thought I'd revitalise it by testing out a few new skincare choices - here are some of my top picks:

BINKY'S AUTUMN SKINCARE PICKS 

DHC Platinum Silver Nanocolloid Cream

This platinum infused moisturiser leaves my skin feeling gloriously smooth and hydrated. It's particularly suited to those whose skin is just starting to show the first signs of ageing, as it contains anti-oxidant rich olive oil and firming olive leaf extract to combat fine lines and uneven skin texture. As Mummy Felstead always reminds me, the key to youthful looking skin in your older years is to start early – prevention is better than cure!

REN Glycolactic Radiance Renewal Mask

This weekly mask transforms dreary, tired-looking skin in an instant (well, 10 minutes!). Made up of a combination of nutritious fruit acids, the powerful formula removes dead skin cells, reduces blemishes and smooths the skin's surface, leaving you with a significantly brighter, more radiant complexion. The zesty citrus scent and slight tingling effect on the skin make the mask a real pleasure to use, too.

La Roche-Posay Pigmentclar Eyes

I've had a few late nights with filming recently, and so have been reaching for this super-effective dark circle corrector to brighten and soothe my tired peepers. Pigmentclar Eyes blends a high concentration of caffeine with light-reflecting pigments to banish dark circles and illuminate the eye area, and its gentle texture makes it suitable for the delicate under eye region, providing an instant cooling effect once applied.

Perfect timing: Binky says autumn is a great opportunity to refresh your skin after the dry summer months

Eucerin DermatoCLEAN Micellar Cleansing Fluid

After seeing lots of fellow bloggers rave about this micellar cleanser, I thought I'd try it out. Similarly to my favourite Bioderma Sensbio H2O, this Eucerin fluid feels ultra-light on the skin without leaving an oily residue. As it's made up of purely natural ingredients, it's perfect for easily irritated skin and removes mascara like a dream when applied with a cotton pad. Plus it's a toner as well as a cleanser and make-up remover – 3 skincare steps in one product makes it a definite winner in my eyes.

Skinbreeze Blemish Fix

Let's face it, we all suffer from bad skin days, whether it's redness and blemishes or a spot that just won't budge. I always rely on the fast-acting Skinbreeze Blemish Fix to stop spots in their tracks – it contains salicylic and hyaluronic acids to quickly tackle breakouts, blemishes and redness. As well as this, it's infused with seaweed extract to leave skin feeling soothed and nourished.

New style: In addition to rebooting her skincare routine Binky tries out Hollywood waves this week

BINKY'S HOW TO: HOLLYWOOD WAVES 

I also thought I'd show you a quick hair tutorial this week – my friend Emily helped me create this gorgeous sleek wavy do for a night out recently. I've been loving rocking this glamorous Hollywood-style look both day and night as an alternative to my usual more messy boho style. Here’s how to do it: 

 

After applying a heat protection product such as Bumble and Bumble Heat/UV Protective Primer, brush your hair throroughly to untangle any knots and ensure a smooth, sleek curl.

Clip the majority of your hair up to the top of your head, leaving roughly an inch of hair around the whole head at the bottom to start with.

Using a medium-sized pair of tongs like Babyliss Volume Waves, take a small section of hair and lightly wrap it around the tong, holding in place for a few seconds. Ensure the hair is wrapped flat around the tongs for a smooth finish.

Voila! Binky recommends using a heat treatment spray to keep curls looking sleek 

For a Hollywood-style sleek, glamorous look, curl each section of hair in the same direction and keep the sections of hair being curled of equal size.

Repeat the process across your whole head of hair by taking down further sections until you reach the top. When you reach the crown, use the tongs to curl the last sections of hair in the opposite direction to the rest of the curls to give the style some body and avoid looking like a poodle!

Once you’ve curled all of your hair, give the finished look some serious volume by backcombing the top half of your hair, working a comb gently upwards to create body near the crown. Don’t worry if your hair starts looking a bit crazy, as it can easily be smoothed out!

Finally, use a bristly brush to sleek out your backcombed barnet, and hold the style in place with a long-lasting hairspray such as Bumble + Bumble Spray de Mode. Et voila! A sleek Hollywood-style barnet without having to set foot into the salon.

Stay gorgeous,
