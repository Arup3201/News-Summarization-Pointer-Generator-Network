Sisters, sisters: actress Sienna (left) and fashion designer Savannah Miller

Her younger sister Sienna is a multi-millionaire Hollywood star. 

But for fashion designer Savannah, life is a little harder. 

Miss Miller, 35, has revealed she was forced to sell her Gloucestershire home after her business ran into trouble last year because she suffered post-natal depression and encountered problems with her financial backers.

In an interview with The Sunday Times Miss Miller reveals she sold the home in Stroud for £597,000 and made little profit out of it, admitting that she and her family ‘were living beyond our means and the house was far too expensive to run. But it was a wrench to let go of it.

‘My business ran into trouble in spring of last year because I had postnatal depression and we had real issues with my financial backers, and we didn’t have a fall-back plan. We had to sell our house.

‘I took a break from my business for some of last year. We moved to Panama to live a crazy life in the jungle while my husband set up an adventure tour company.

‘Now I’m building a more sustainable business.’

Miss Miller currently lives in rented accommodation in Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire, with her children, Moses, 9, Lyra, 6, and Bali, 2, and her 19-year-old stepson, Java.

Her husband, Nicholas Skinner, 42, splits his time between their home and Panama.

Miss Miller claims that she earned between £43,000 to £75,000 last year and said being hard-up had taught her the value of money: ‘It makes you budget every single penny.

'We frivolously buy a coffee here and take a taxi there, and before you know it, you’ve spent £100.

‘Of course it’s not fun being hard up, but it’s a good exercise to make you appreciate what you normally take for granted.

‘You need to budget and have a savings cushion. I was supporting my family on my own, which has put a lot of pressure on me.

'I don’t think you realise how valuable security and stability are until they are gone.’
