We're used to seeing them parade along our television screens, happily singing Hakuna Mutata or humorously saying 'simples'.

But it seems Aleksandr Orlov, Timon and their meerkat pals have a secret dark side.

A new study has found the cuddly creatures are 'nasty, brutish and short' - and are actually callous killers.

Dark side: They might look 'cute and fluffy', but meerkats have a dark side and are 'nasty and brutish', experts claim

The study, carried out by a group of British and South African universities, found the dominant female meerkat uses violence to survive and often abandons other females once they give birth.

It then brutally kills and eats their offspring to ensure they have enough food for their own pup and their pool of meerkat 'babysitters'.

The study's leader, Dr Matthew Bell, from the University of Edinburgh's School of Biological Sciences, said the findings were all the more shocking because meerkats are 'cute and fluffy'.

He said: 'Since meerkats are cute and fluffy, and have been saccharine, anthropomorphized poster children for happy family life, it comes across as more shocking.

'Contrary to the public perception meerkat lives are "nasty, brutish and short".'

Meerkats have been used as loveable creatures on the Compare the Meerkat adverts since 2009 - but researchers say that, in reality, they are not as nice as the advert would have you believe

The study, published in July in Nature
 Communications, looked at the effect of giving contraceptive jabs to 
female helpers in groups of meerkats in the Kalahari Desert. The jabs 
ensured the helpers could not reproduce for six months.

During that period, dominant females were less aggressive towards the helpers, foraged more, gained more weight and had bigger pups.

The female helpers provided more care and food for the dominant female's offspring.

Dr Bell wrote: 'We've done the first clear experiment that measures the value that dominants gain from suppressing their subordinates.

'Such benefits have always been assumed, but never clearly confirmed.' 

Dr Andrew Young, an evolutionary biologist at Britain's University of Exeter, who was not involved in Bell's study, said: 'That's sort of the niche in which meerkats fit as a nice model, because there's very strong hierarchy but subordinates do still try to breed.'

Meerkats are also competitive in captivity, according to Agnes Maluleke from the Johannesburg zoo.

The zoo, which has 20 meerkats, has previously had to split up a group when a young pup challenged a dominant female.

It turned into a vicious scrap that Maluleke described as 'fighting for life or death'.
