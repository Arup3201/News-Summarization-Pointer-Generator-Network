The man serving a life sentence for the murder of Joanna Yeates in 2010 has been found guilty of a string of sex offences after police found more than 100 images of child pornography on his laptop. 

Vincent Tabak was jailed in 2011 after strangling Miss Yeates and dumping her body in the snow on the outskirts of Bristol. 

Police seized his laptop as part of the investigation into her death and found 145 indecent images of children stored on it. 

Before admitting to possessing the child pornography, Tabak, 37, protested he would not receive a fair trial because his previous crime was so high profile.

Guilty plea: Joanna Yeates's killer Vincent Tabak had admitted four counts of posessing child pornography after images were found on a laptop. He was jailed in 2011 after strangling the 25-year-old and dumping her body in snow 

A judge rejected his argument, jailing him for 10 months at Bristol Crown Court, where he was found guilt of murder four years ago. 

The court heard how the paedophile had stored more than 100 images of children on the computer, with the youngest among them of younger than 10.

Flanked by security guards, he held his head in his hands in the dock as the court heard how he had a 'perverse interest in child pornography.' 

In 2011, at the same court house, Tabak was convicted of killing 25-year-old Joanna Yeates after becoming obsessed with her. 

The 25-year-old's body was found covered in snow on the outskirts of Bristol 

The pair were neighbours, with Miss Yeates living in the groundfloor flat next door to his where, jurors were told, he had watched violent pornography. 

After spurning his advances Miss Yeates was killed and dumped by the side of the road in Failand on the outskirts of the city. 

The jury heard how in the months before Jo’s death Tabak had viewed violent porn websites showing women being controlled by men, with images of them bound, gagged and held by the neck and choked.

Others showed a woman who looked chillingly like his victim. 

Miss Yeates's frozen body - which had suffered 43 separate injuries - was found in a similar position to a woman in one pornographic film. 

In 2013, the Crown Prosecution Service announced they would pursue charges relating to child pornography. 

His guilty plea today came after a failed attempt by his legal team to have the case thrown out. 

They claimed he would not face a fair trial in and that he would not be given an additional prison sentence.

Dean Armstrong QC, on behalf of Tabak, argued his portrayal in the ITV drama The Lost Honour Of Christopher Jefferies, who was wrongly accused of Miss Yeates's murder, would prevent fairness. 

Judge Neil Ford QC rejected the argument after telling the court it was not his position to comment on the CPS decision to prosecute. 

He also discounted the argument that putting Tabak on the Sex Offenders' Register would be pointless as it would have lapsed by the time of his release. 

Speaking after the sentencing, temporary assistant chief constable Julian Moss of Avon and Somerset Police said prosecution had been 'crucial'. 

Tabak's legal team argued he would not face a fair trial over the child pornography charges because of his portrayal in an ITV drama about Christopher Jefferies (right) who was wrongly accused of the murder and later successfully sued national newspapers for libel 

Following his arrest for the murder of Joanna Yeares, Tabak's former girlfriend told police of his haul of pornography 

'Vincent Tabak is a dangerous, calculating and manipulative offender who is already serving a life sentence for the murder of Joanna Yeates. 

'During the course of the investigation into Joanna's murder, indecent images of children were found on Tabak's laptop. These offences did not form part of the initial murder trial.

'Although he's serving a minimum tariff of 20 years' imprisonment, we felt it was crucial Tabak was brought to justice for possessing indecent images of children, so the full nature of Tabak's offending is on record.'

Mr Moss said the conviction meant an 'extensive range' of protective measure could be put in place to manage his behaviour and protect those at risk. 

'It's possible he may return to the Netherlands following release, so it's crucial the Dutch authorities are aware of the risks he poses,' Mr Moss added.

'This could only have been guaranteed if a relevant conviction relating to a sexual interest in children were secured.

'Joanna's murder was a shocking and terrible crime which had a significant impact on the whole of the Bristol community and I hope this latest conviction will ensure her killer is unable to cause any further harm.'
