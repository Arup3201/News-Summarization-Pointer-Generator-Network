Today's butlers go to great lengths to ensure their guests are looked after. 

From running the perfect bath - complete with exact water temperature, scattered rose petals and reading materials, to serving silver service meals, attention to detail is paramount. 

A new infographic gives an insight into the life of a Savoy butler, revealing some of the most off-the-wall requests received from guests. 

Infographic reveals bizarre requests and top tips from butlers at Fairmont hotels  

The London hotel has its own Butler Academy, which aims to train a new generation of butlers to combine the discretion of a traditional butler with the efficiency of a 21st century personal assistant.

As part of the research, by Fairmont hotels, Head Butler Sean Davoren, 56, revealed some of his strangest requests from guests.

He explained that he was once asked to source wild goat's milk for a guest's bath.

The milk itself cost £50 but the taxi ride to Wales and back cost £600, finally 30 bottles of heated Evian water were required to rinse the milk off.

The infographic also gives travellers tips on how to stay smart, such as keeping 1cm of space between all clothes to ensure air can circulate, which can help to reduce odours and wrinkles; wrapping best outfits in tissue paper; and keeping necklaces from tangling by running one side of each through a plastic straw.

Butlers at Fairmont hotels around the world have been given with some peculiar tasks.

One guest  wanted to be supplied with 20 pounds of ice for his penguins; a couple staying at a luxury hotel in New York requested a life-sized chocolate statue of themselves for their wedding; and a film crew asked for a professionally trained, camera ready monkey after theirs failed to show up.
