A pedestrian was killed when an out-of-control car ploughed through a wall and into a bank.

The Mercedes sedan smashed through the wall of the ANZ branch in Adelaide, Australia, leaving a large hole in the side of the bank.

The 72-year-old pedestrian, from Marino, had been walking through the Marion shopping centre car park with a friend when he was hit.

The pedestrian died after being hit by the out-of-control which smashed into the wall of the ANZ bank branch

He died from his injuries but the 62-year-old woman he was walking with suffered only minor injuries.

Witnesses reportedly heard the car accelerate and its horn being hit before crashing into the wall at about 2pm on Monday.

Two people who were inside the bank at the time of the fatal crash suffered minor injuries.

Pictures from the scene showed the Mercedes embedded in the wall of the shopping centre bank branch.

Rubble and brick dust could be seen around the car and wires handing from the wall after police removed a cordon.

The authorities spent hours removing the sedan from the crash scene.

Two people were also injured in the ANZ bank branch when the elderly driver lost control in the car park

The 81-year-old driver was in a serious condition after the smash, which police say may have been caused when he was taken ill behind the wheel

Investigators believe the driver may have suffered a medical episode before crashing.

The 81-year-old man was initially trapped inside the car before being transferred to hospital.

He was reported to be in a serious condition.

Chief Inspector Trevor Lovegrove said it was too early to be certain of how it happened.

He told Adelaide Now: 'It's extremely lucky that there weren't other people walking through the car park at the time.

'This is absolutely tragic. It's circumstances which no one could predict. It's a tragedy for the families that this man has lost his life.'
