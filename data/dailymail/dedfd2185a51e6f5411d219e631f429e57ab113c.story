Sultry Irina Shayk is no stranger to striking a pose in practically nothing.

The Russian supermodel has made a name for herself as an Angel for lingerie giant Victoria's Secret as well as a Sports Illustrated cover girl.

And now the 27-year-old puts all that beach side posing in to practise as she shows off her latest designs for luxury swim brand Beach Bunny.

Irina Shayk models her latest designs for swimwear brand Beach Bunny

The fiery red 'Take The Reins' two-piece costs around $300

In a collection of sensational 
photographs the model is the best advertisement for her own line, including a fiery red two-piece complete with golden detail that is called 'Take The Reins'.

The accompanying video shows Irina wading through tropical water in a gravity-defying black bikini as well as cavorting by herself on the sand in a plunging white Grecian-inspired swimsuit.

An earlier collection from the model-turned-designer was given the stamp of approval via her popular Twitter account in April.

The sultry star tweeted to her 300,000 followers: 'What
 do you all think of the new Beach Bunny Swimwear BRONZE collection? I LOVE 
it :)))'

Hard-working Irina is seen in a video to accompany the latest swimwear pictures

And it's not the first time the Russian has showcased her figure as part of a campaign.

Back in 2007 she became the face of 
Italian lingerie line Intimissimi and modelled a range of bras, briefs, 
and other pieces of négligée, carrying on being the image for the brand 
for the next consecutive three years.

From 2010 she became an official ambassador for the brand, and she has been associated with Beach Bunny since 2009.

It
 was also back in 2007 that she made her first appearance in the 
legendary Sports Illustrated publication, going on to feature inside it 
five times and on the cover once, in 2011.

Styling is kept minimal as the model lets her incredible body do the talking

She has also appeared on covers of 
magazines in Spain including ELLE, Harper's Bazaar, and GQ - as well as 
covering British Esquire in 2012.

And recently made a scantily-clad cameo appearance in an Agent Provocateur advert directed by Penelope Cruz.

But
 it's not all standing around in front of the cameras for the brown 
haired, green eyed beauty - she is also something of a philanthropist.

She
 has invested some of her earnings charitably in her hometown of 
Yemanzhelinsk where - along with her sisters - she helped rebuild the 
children's ward of a local hospital and now also helps raise money for 
sick children in Russia.
