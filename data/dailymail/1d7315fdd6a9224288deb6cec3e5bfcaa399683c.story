Mike Nuanes thought he'd seen the last of his dog Jordan when the shih tzu puppy disappeared from his house seven years ago.

But last week the Denver man got the shock of his life when he got a call from almost 1,400 miles away at Atlanta's Fulton County Animal Shelter notifying him that they had his long missing dog.

'When she asked, 'Is his name Jordan?' That's when my jaw hit the ground,' he said.

Mike Nuanes was reunited with dog Jordan in Atlanta seven years after the shih tzu disappeared from his house in Denver

Nuanes believes someone stole the puppy from his backyard while he and his late wife were having breakfast with family at a neighboring house

'After I picked my jaw up off the ground, I asked, 'Is he a little chocolate fellow?''

Nuanes told KGW he believes someone stole the puppy from his backyard while he and his late wife were having breakfast with family at a neighboring house.

'Being the optimist that I am, when they called me I thought, 'Well, I know he didn't walk to Atlanta, so somebody must have been taking care of him all these years,'' he said. 

Jordan was rescued in October and believed to be a stray. He had missing patches of fur, was crawling with fleas, and at just over 5 pounds was dangerously underweight for a dog of his type, which normally weighs 10 to 12 pounds.

'He was in pretty bad shape,' said Jill Davis, who works at Fulton County Animal Services.

Luckily they were able to match him to Nuanes via a microchip.  

When Jordan was found he had missing patches of fur, was crawling with fleas, and at just over 5 pounds was dangerously underweight for a dog of his type, which normally weighs 10 to 12 pounds

'He was shocked. It didn't take him a second to say, 'I'm going to get him a ticket and fly him out here (to Denver).'' Davis said.

He arrived with a new collar, leash, food, and bowls for his newly returned friend. 

On the flight back on Frontier Airlines, Nuanes said people even have up their front row seats so Jordan had room to travel in his lap. 

And he fits right in with Nuanes' four other dogs.

'They accepted him right in and they're getting closer to him,' Nuanes said. 'Life is good at the Nuanes household for the dogs.'
