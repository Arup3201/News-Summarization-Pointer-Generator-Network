A wartime diary of one of Adolf Hitler's senior henchman has been handed over to the Holocaust Memorial Museum after it mysteriously vanished 70 years ago.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement transferred about 400 handwritten pages from the diary of Alfred Rosenberg to the D.C. museum on Tuesday.

Rosenberg, who played a significant role in 
the slaughter of millions of Jews and other non-Aryans  under the Third Reich, once wrote in his diary about having lunch with Hitler - while the Nazi leader, who was vegetarian, offered his opinions on the evils of meat.

Although official translations have not yet been completed, a basic translation reveals that at a Berlin lunch around February 1941, Hitler said that sick children should not be given meat but fruit and vegetables to improve their health. 

Rosenberg wrote: 'He [Hitler] is convinced that plant eaters... the tenacious forces of life.'

The fascist noted in his diary about his travels around Germany to inspire Nazi forces on the brink of war.

Rosenberg also penned details of his meetings with fellow Nazi henchman Hermann Goering where they discussed 'ethno-psychological foreign policy'.

Rosenberg was convicted of war crimes at the Nuremberg trials after World War II and executed in 1946.

Holocaust Memorial Museum Director Sara J. Bloomfield said on Tuesday that the diary will help in understanding the ideas that led to the extremist ideology of Nazism. The Holocaust Memorial Museum has posted scans of the newly acquired
 diary pages on its website, with accompanying German transcripts. An official English translation is not yet available.

The Holocaust Memorial Museum has not provided official English translations. According to basic translations online, some diary excerpts reveal details of Rosenberg's lunches with Hitler and his trips across Germany to stir troops at the dawn of the Second World War:

April 27, 1936: Rosenberg says he spoke to 9,400 Nazis in Stuttgart, saying that they stand 'solidly behind me in my fight' 

'After the Congress', 1937: The Nazi describes his battles against Catholicism and the Pope.

May 21, 1939: Rosenberg discusses meeting with another high-ranking Nazi Hermann Goering where he developed his views on 'ethno-psychological foreign policy'.

February 2, 1941: Rosenberg describes how he ate lunch with Hitler in Berlin where the Nazi leader reportedly said that sick children should not be given meat but fruit and vegetables. The henchman writes: 'He [Hitler] is convinced that plant eaters... the tenacious forces of life.'

September 1, 1941: Rosenberg says that having been bed-ridden with periostitis - a chronic inflammation of the tissue around bones - he had time to consider the details of his ministry -  such as staffing and interviews. He adds that the future of Ukraine is a 'yet completely undecided problem'. 

According to the museum, the diary 
contains details of Rosenberg's meetings with Hitler, squabbles among 
senior Nazis and bombing raids on Germany.

The long-lost diary was uncovered earlier this year in upstate New York after disappearing 70 years ago.

The diary pages were found at a publishing business in Lewiston, New York.

Officials say Rosenberg's diary was smuggled 
into the U.S. after the war, most likely by Robert M.W. 
Kempner, a government lawyer during the Nuremberg trials. 

Born in Germany, Kempner had fled to America in the 1930s to escape the Nazis, only to return for post-war trials.

Kempner
 cited a few Rosenberg diary excerpts in his memoir, and in 1956 a 
German historian published entries from 1939 and 1940. But the bulk of 
the diary never surfaced.

The lawyer died in 1993, and museum officials later took possession of some of his
 extensive document collection.

But the Rosenberg diary remained missing
 until recently.

'One of 
the enduring mysteries of the Second World War is what happened to the 
Rosenberg diary,' said John Morton, director of U.S. Immigrations and 
Custom Enforcement said in June. 

'We have solved that mystery.'

The search for the diary dates to 1996, when two of Kempner's 
former legal secretaries approached a Holocaust museum official about 
Kempner's collection of papers.

Over
 several years, museum officials assessed and took possession 
of several documents from Kempner's collection, although some material 
they initially viewed in 1997 at Kempner's Pennsylvania home were 
missing when they went to retrieve the papers.

Officials later learned that the two secretaries and 'another gentleman from upstate New York' had taken the papers.

The papers were found in the hands of 
Herbert Richardson, an academic publisher in Lewiston who once worked for Mr 
Kempner, according to The New York Times.

Officials found the materials with the 
help of a private investigator and former FBI agent.

Acting
 upon a warrant issued by a federal magistrate judge in Delaware, 
authorities seized the diary in April. 

Gerhard 
Weinberg, professor emeritus of history at the University of North 
Carolina and a leading historian on the Nazi era, said in June that the diary could 
shed new light on Rosenberg's role in administering the occupied eastern
 territories, and his relationships with other high-ranking Nazi 
officials.

Museum officials
 said the documents provide valuable information, as Rosenberg helped 
orchestrate the looting of artwork and other valuables from 
Nazi-occupied territory during that the time.

'Its
 discovery will undoubtedly give scholars new insight into the politics 
of Nazi leaders and fulfills a museum commitment to uncover evidence 
from perpetrators of the Holocaust,' a web posting said.

Rosenberg, a Nazi ideologue and 
propagandist, was the author of The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a 
1930 book espousing the superiority of Aryan culture over the Jewish 
race.

Rosenberg was instrumental in developing and promoting the notion of a German 'master race' superior to other Europeans and, above all, to non-Europeans and Jews.

Born in 1893 into an ethnic German family in what is today Estonia, Rosenberg, who loathed Christianity and 'degenerate' modern art, doubled as Hitler's point man in occupied eastern Europe and Russia during WW2.

He was also tasked by Hitler to oversee the systematic plundering of countless works of art throughout occupied Europe, many of which remain missing to this day.

Captured by Allied troops at the end of the 1939-45 war, Rosenberg was convicted at Nuremberg of war crimes. He was executed on October 16, 1946 at the age of 53.

He later led the Nazi Party's foreign affairs department and rose through the party hierarchy to become Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories in 1941.

Among
 early translated excerpts is a passage from 1941 in which Rosenberg 
wrote proudly of a conference marking 'the first time in European 
history that 10 European nations were represented at an anti-Jewish 
conference with the clear program to remove this race from Europe. ...'

Later that year, Rosenberg wrote of 
reports that Russian leader Josef Stalin had ordered the 400,000 Volga 
Germans 'to be dragged away to Siberia, i.e. to have them murdered. ...'

'Yesterday
 I had a proposal drafted for communication by broadcast to Russia, 
England and the USA that in case this mass murder is implemented, 
Germany will punish the Jews of Central Europe for this.'

Other
 translated excerpts involve the 1936 Olympic games, including 
Rosenberg's assertions that Britons were 'angry about the negroes from 
the USA as they squeeze out the English during the Olympic Games'.
