Amanda Knox has been spotted cycling around her hometown as she prepares to appeal against her conviction of the murder of British student Meredith Kercher.

The 26-year-old was pictured riding her black-and-purple bike to a local Goodwill store in Seattle, Washington, on Saturday.

She could be seen sporting a hooded top, gloves and bright pink socks - with her short hair tucked under a black helmet.

Goodwill stores, which sell donated goods from the community, use their profits to provide free job training and basic education to people on low incomes.

It comes just weeks after Knox was sentenced to 28 years in prison for killing Ms Kercher with the help of her then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito.

Ms Kercher, from Coulsdon in Surrey, was found dead with her throat slashed in the bedroom of her home she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy, on November 2, 2007.

Knox and Sollecito were convicted of her murder in 2009 and sentenced to 25 and 28 years in prison respectively.

Concern: Knox, pictured fastening her cycling helmet, is preparing to appeal against her conviction of the murder of Meredith Kercher. She was sentenced to 28 years in jail in January for killing the British student

However, they were acquitted and released in 2011 after an appeals court reviewed the facts of the case.

Following her release, Knox went back to her home in Seattle, Washington - and when the case went to retrial in September last year, she refused to return to Italy.

However, on January 30, an Italian appeals court reconvicted Knox and her former boyfriend of murdering Ms Kercher 

'I am frightened and saddened by this 
unjust verdict,' Knox wrote after the ruling. 'Having been found 
innocent before, I expected better from the Italian justice system.'

Refusing to leave: Knox  and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were convicted of Ms Kercher's murder in 2009 and sentenced to 25 and 28 years in prison respectively. But they were acquitted and released in 2011

There are now questions over whether or not Knox can be extradited back to Italy to face her prison sentence.

The decision is up to the U.S. Supreme Court, which must confirm Knox's guilty verdict before Italy can apply for her extradition and arrest.

Sollecito, who was handed a 25-year prison sentence, was found a hotel near the Italian border following the appeal - and later had his passport revoked.

Last month, Knox denied claims that her ex-boyfriend was trying to distance himself from her - writing on her blog: 'Raffaele has plenty of reason for resentment, but not against me. The 
only reason he has been dragged into this is because he happens to be my
 alibi.'

Fight: Last month, Knox posted this image of herself holding a sign on Twitter - saying 'We are innocent'

She added: 'He
 is collateral damage in the unreasonable, irresponsible and unrelenting
 scapegoating of the prosecution’s grotesque caricature that is "Foxy 
Knoxy".'

Knox's blog post came as she posted portrait of herself on Twitter showing her holding a sign declaring her innocence in Italian.

In the black-and-white photo, she can be seen holding a piece of paper with the words 'SIAMO INNOCENTI', which means 'We are innocent'.

Rudey Guede, whom Knox and Sollecito have
 blamed for the murder of Ms Kercher, is currently serving a 16-year 
sentence for murdering and sexually assaulting the student.

Reconvicted: On January 30, an Italian appeals court reconvicted Knox and Sollecito (pictured the day after the murder) of killing Ms Kercher. Knox was sentenced to 28 years in prison, while Sollecito was given 25 years

During his trial, Guede admitted being at the murder scene - but insisted he had been in the toilet at the time Ms Kercher was attacked.

He claimed he had emerged to see ‘someone resembling Sollecito’ fleeing the scene and ‘Knox outside the house’ in Perugia.

Last month, Guede's lawyer, Valter Biscotti, revealed the prisoner was now eligible for day release - and had been given permission to study History at an undisclosed university in Italy.
