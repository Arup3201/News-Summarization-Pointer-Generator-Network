The mom whose two children were 'slaughtered by their nanny' is now facing the daily trauma of coming face to face with the sister of their alleged killer on the school run.

Marina Krim arrived home to the family apartment in the Upper West Side last October to find two of her three children dead in the bath-tub with horrific stab wounds and slit throats.

Lucia, 6, and 2-year-old Leo Krim were found next to nanny Yoselyn Ortega, who had slit her own throat in an alleged suicide attempt.

According to the New York Post, now Ortega's lookalike sister, who is also a caregiver, babysits a girl who attends the same public school as the Krims' surviving daughter, Nessie.

In an email the paper says it has seen  a copy of, Mrs Krim describes her anguish at discovering that the family that employs Celia Ortega lives near them once again

She says: 'Can you imagine my anxiety as I am walking out of school with Nessie and on a daily basis wondering if I am going to run into this woman?

'She introduced us to the defendant who murdered our kids and Nessie's sister and brother,' the email continues.

'Making it all worse, we now find out she lied about the defendant's background to improve the chances of us hiring the defendant.'

'Now, Marina is reliving her nightmare every day,' a close friend told the paper.

Mrs Krim and her husband, Kevin, took Nessie and left the city for a couple of months after the horrific incident to try to start over. They relocated to Tribeca when they returned to New York in early 2013.

Kevin and Marina Krim have revealed how their surviving daughter Nessie, is helping them deal with the agony of the murder of her siblings Leo, 2,  and Lucia, 6

But the parents who employ Ortega's sister, Henley and Xabi Vazquez, had moved from the Upper West Side themselves to the same neighborhood, and their little girl now attends the same school as Nessie.

'The most upsetting part is [the Krims] really moved as far away as possible from the scene and tried to rebuild their lives,' the friend continued. 'They've been doing great. And now it comes back to haunt them.'

The school principal tried to resolve the situation by asking the Vazquezes not to send the nanny to school pickups, the New York Post reported, and in the end they settled on an arrangement that would see Celia Ortega pick up 15 minutes after everyone else.

But Mrs Krim wrote in her email: 'the other day, I saw Celia three feet from me at 2:56 pm.

'My heart was racing, I was disturbed and angry . . . Celia was practically wearing a disguise, wearing big sunglasses and an olive-green quilted coat, she basically grabbed the daughter and rushed away, looking to me like she knew she was breaking the bargain. I just cannot deal with this anymore, enough is enough.'

In the days following Lucia and Leo's deaths, it was reported that Celia Ortega was wracked with guilt and sorrow because she helped her sister get the job.  

'I don't know what happened. She loved the kids. She loved Marina,'she said. 'I would like to die. I would give my life for the children to come back.'

At the time, Mrs Ortega also said that she could not face seeing Mrs Krim.

'I can't talk to Marina now. Maybe when she is more relaxed. I will give her a hug,' she said.
