Jailed: Constantin-Tiberiu Gheorge, 39, spent more than a year raiding a string of homes across London, Kent and Essex, leaving his fingerprints and blood at every scene

A Romanian burglar who left his DNA at every one of the 31 homes escaped capture because he was not on the police database.

Constantin-Tiberiu Gheorge, 39, spent more than a year raiding a string of homes across London, Kent and Essex.

But despite finding either his blood or fingerprints at the scenes, officers were powerless to identify Gheorge.

The mystery sparked an urgent review by a specialist detection team, who identified Gheorge as a suspect. He was later arrested in Barking town centre.

Today, he was sentenced to eight years in prison at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London.

Gheorge, who pleaded guilty to all 31 burglaries, left at least one piece of DNA at every home.

Officers became suspicious as they noticed the series of crimes - spanning 14 months - shared one single DNA profile.

In most cases the suspect would leave DNA behind in the form of blood, but in some cases it was fingerprints.

At an address in Kent, he left DNA and fingerprints.

But despite having the suspect's DNA profile and fingerprints, the police could not match him to any of their records.

The linked series was allocated to a specialist detection team where officers completed a review of the cases and analysis of all the information available.

As a result Gheorge was identified as a suspect.

On May 20 Gheorge pleaded guilty to 31 burglary offences at Snaresbrook Crown Court.

Sentenced: Today the Romanian burglar was sentenced to eight years in jail after pleading guilty to 31 counts

Detective Sergeant Brett Hagen, from the detections team, said: 'Gheorge has to be one of the most prolific and yet one of the most careless burglars I have encountered.

'He has committed numerous offences across London, Kent and Essex with a blatant disregard for the victims and police alike.

'It is worth considering that for every one of these offences there was at least one victim who had to deal with the effects of becoming a victim of crime and where burglary is concerned the lasting effects run far deeper than a loss of property.'
