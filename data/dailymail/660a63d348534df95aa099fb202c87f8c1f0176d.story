With the biggest fight in boxing history set to take place in just over a month, Floyd Mayweather has shown that his preparation is in full flow.

The undefeated champion takes on Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas on May 2 as he puts his 'legend status' on the line to give the fighting world a clash that it's been craving for a number of years.

In the short video, Mayweather talks about the letters 'T.B.E' on all his training gear and how he plans to never be forgotten.

The undefeated champions wants to leave a legacy in the fighting world and be known as 'the best ever'

Mayweather spoke about Muhammad Ali being 'the greatest' but he wants his own title to be remembered

He said: 'T.B.E. stands for, the best ever. I want to leave my own mark in the sport of boxing.

'No different from how Ali (Muhammad) was known as the greatest. When someone says - the best ever - the first person I want them people to think about is Floyd Mayweather.'

Whatever the outcome of the bout, the undefeated champion is certainly going to put on a show against his tough Filipino opponent. 

The bout against WBO champion Pacquiao at the MGM Grand is expected to total $300million - in what will be the most expensive bout in boxing history. In the UK, Sky Sports are expected to win the bidding rights to broadcast the fight.
