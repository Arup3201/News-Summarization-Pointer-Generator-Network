A Pennsylvania hospital will soon become the first to offer an inpatient detox program for those addicted to the internet.

Bradford Regional Medical Center in Bradford, Pennsylvania will open its doors September 9 to those whose lives have spiraled out of control thanks to their gaming or web surfing habits.

The program will offer a voluntary, 10-day stint and was created by experts in other, more traditional addictions like alcohol or drugs.

Problematic? For those whose internet use veers into addiction territory, a Pennsylvania hospital now offers a $14,000, 10-day 'digital detox' program

‘[Internet addiction] is a problem in this country that can be more pervasive than alcoholism,’ Dr. Kimberly Young, the psychologist who founded the non-profit program, told Fox News.

‘The Internet is free, legal and fat free,’ she said.

In the hospital wing already occupied by patients with addictions of other sorts, groups of four internet addicts will take classes and take part in the sort of group therapy traditionally reserved for chemical addicts.

They will be people like Kevin Roberts, a 44-year-old beat his 12 hour per day video gaming habit and wrote Cyber Junkie: Escape the Gaming and Internet Trap.

Counterpoint: US psychiatrist and author, Allen Frances says an official diagnosis for internet addiction isn't 'ready for primetime' and warns that such diagnoses could be frivolous or unhelpful

Researchers at the University of Kentucky say that anywhere from .3 and 38 percent of Americans are likely addicted to the internet. They point to some symptoms, not unlike those of more traditional addictions, that one should look for:

In it, Roberts describes classic addiction symptoms.

‘Like most addicts, I went through a series of self-deception,’ he said.

Meanwhile, Young warns that there’s a difference between an addiction and a commonplace over dependence on the internet.

But the price tag of the program should be prohibitive enough to keep away everyone but the most desperate of internet addicts.

A stay at the digital detox will cost around $14,000 and insurance won’t cover it.

Despite its high cost, some experts worry that internet addiction in general isn’t even real.

‘If we can be addicted to gambling and the Internet, why not also include addictions to shopping, exercise, sex, work, golf, sunbathing, model railroading, you name it,’ wrote Duke University psychiatrist Dr. Allen Frances in a Huffington Post op-ed.

Dr, Frances was the chairman of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV. In the newer iteration of the psychological diagnosis bible, ‘gaming disorder’ was listed among the potential diagnoses that require further research before they become listed.

According to Frances, that means the disorder ‘wasn’t ready for primetime.’
