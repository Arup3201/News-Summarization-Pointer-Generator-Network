You may be strong — but are you Disney villain strong?

A parkgoer at Disney World thought he'd test his muscles against the buff hunter Gaston, from 'The Beauty and the Beast.'

It did not turn out well for him. 

'You think you're pretty strong?' Blake Platt challenges Gaston, as seen in his YouTube video. 'I think I'm stronger than you.'

Gaston, the main antagonist from the 1991 Disney classic, seems amused.

'You think you're stronger than me? What's the challenge?' he barks back. 'A  push-up contest?'

The two start on an almost even keel, but Gaston quickly starts to outpace Platt.

When Platt begins to lose steam, the villain takes his final shot.

'It looks like he's struggling  — perhaps he needs a hand!' Gaston taunts, launching into a series of rapid one-arm push-ups.

Platt still tries to keep up, but slows down and flushes bright-red while Gaston keeps going.

The challenger  gives up — to approving jeers from the villain.

The hilarious encounter comes just weeks after Gaston was taken to task in a viral video filmed at the same park.

After the character criticises the Beast from Beauty and the Beast, the young girls says: 'The Beast is my favourite character.'

As Gaston jokes with her, the young girl goes on to shout: 'No, no, no, the Beast is marrying Belle!'
