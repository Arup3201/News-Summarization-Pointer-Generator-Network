Taronga Western Plains Zoo in Dubbo in Central Western New South Wales, have named their new born female calf , Ajali - which translates to destiny in the East African Swahili language

The birth of a female Giraffe calf has  zoo keepers thrilled, as the number of Giraffes in the wild have decreased by 30 per cent in the past decade.

Taronga Western Plains Zoo in Dubbo in Central Western New South Wales have named the new born calf , Ajali (pronounced A-jah-lee) - which translates to destiny in the East African Swahili language.

On Sunday 19 October, keepers were ecstatic to welcome their newest addition to the Giraffe herd, joining another young male calf, Nkoski, who was born earlier this year in August.

'It is always nice to see youngsters on exhibit together and knowing that they have a companion close to their age,' said Anthony Dorrian, a Giraffe keeper at Taronga Western Plains Zoo. 

'The calves are already starting to develop a relationship, as Nkosi is very curious about the new calf.'

The 11-day-old Ajali has  been spotted bonding with her mother, Tuli, who had previously given birth to seven other Giraffes.

'She has a very nurturing nature towards her newborn,' Mr Dorrian said of the experience mother. 

Unlike Tuli, other Giraffes may typically reject their calf after birth.

'In the past we have had to hand raise a couple of Giraffes - especially if it's a first time mum, it is really confusing and they don't know what is going on, Mr Dorrian said. 

'After giving birth they just walk away and leave the baby.'

But luckily the spotted long-neck calf, Ajali, was instantly embraced by her mother and the Giraffe herd.

'The first day they are born the rest of the herd are really curious and all come over.

'We have 12 other Giraffes and they stuck their head out to have a look - it didn't take a long time for the calf [Ajali] to get used to them.'  

The majestic African animal has spent her first few days testing out her wobbly legs as she was photographed frolicking in the sun and nestling up to her protective mum.

The zoo keepers' excitement for their second calf this year comes as the number of Giraffes in the wild are significantly falling, leaving only 80,000 left in the world.

Due to 'poaching for bush meat' and humans frequently invading their habitat, Mr Dorrian said 'eventually we will end up with smaller and smaller isolated pockets of giraffes.' 

'Every birth for a species such as the Giraffe that is experiencing a decline in the wild population is important, as it helps to insure against extinction,' said Mr Dorrian.
