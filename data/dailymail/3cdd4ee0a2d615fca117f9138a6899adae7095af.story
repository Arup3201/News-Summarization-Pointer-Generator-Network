The jersey that LeBron James wore when the basketball superstar cramped up during the NBA Finals was auctioned off for $50,020 (£29,167).

An air-conditioning failure during game one of the series between Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs in Texas saw the temperatures inside the AT&T Center rise to almost 100 degrees.

And with the game up for grabs in the fourth quarter, James was forced off and carried back to the bench with cramp.

San Antonio capitalised on James' absence and pulled away to clinch a 110-95 victory and a 1-0 lead in the series.

After Miami won game two 98-96, the Spurs responded with three emphatic victories, all by a margin of more than 17 points, to seal their fifth NBA crown with a resounding 4-1 series victory.

The buyer of the $50,020 jersey also 
placed the winning bids for the shirts worn by Tim Duncan ($20,770), 
Kawhi Leonard ($14,020), Tony Parker ($11,020), Dwyane Wade ($10,770), 
Ray Allen ($5,770), Chris Bosh ($5,770), Shane Battier ($2,820) and

Up in the air: James in an unrestricted free agent and free to join any team he wants

On the move? LeBron could leave the Heat in an attempt to add to the two NBA titles he has already won

James is currently considering his future after opting out of the final two years of his Miami Heat contract to become an unrestricted free agent.

The 29-year-old could leave Miami after a four-year stint in south Florida in a bid to add to the two NBA titles he has already won with the Heat.
