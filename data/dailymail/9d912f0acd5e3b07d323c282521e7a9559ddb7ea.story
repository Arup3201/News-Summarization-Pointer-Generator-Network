If you’re lucky enough to look about 18, there’s a good chance you’ll be asked to provide ID at the supermarket to buy alcohol, knives or glue.

Now an addition has been made to that list of potentially hazardous items – chocolate pudding.

Robert Nemeti was amazed when he was asked for ID while buying a microwaveable pudding at Tesco.

Proof is in the pudding: Shopper Robert Nemeti was stunned when he was asked for ID as the dessert posed a risk to the roof of his mouth

Mr Nemeti, 24, was going through the 
self-service checkout when an on-screen warning announced that his 
purchase had to be ‘approved’.

A member of staff at the store in Southampton hurried over and asked Mr Nemeti to produce identification.

When asked why, the female assistant told him that the Cadbury Hot Chocolate Pudding would get hot when cooked and may burn him.

Mr Nemeti, a photographer, yesterday described the policy as ‘crazy’ health and safety.

He said he did not have any ID on him because he had just ‘nipped to the shop to buy something sweet after work’.

Tesco said the machine should not have requested proof of age for the dessert (file picture)

A member of staff at the store in Southampton demanded Mr Nemeti produce identification showing he was over 18

Luckily the shop worker approved the 
purchase anyway, saying she was satisfied he looked old enough to be 
trusted with the £1 dessert. Mr Nemeti, from Southampton, said: ‘I 
scanned through a pint of milk without any problem and then the pudding.

‘The machine beeped, flashed up a warning on the screen and an annoying automated voice warned “approval needed”.

‘I only bought two items – and they 
weren’t alcohol, cigarettes, solvents or sharp – so I was clueless as to
 why they would need approval.

The 24-year-old described the request for his age as 'health and safety gone mad'

‘The woman who was monitoring the 
self-service checkouts came over and asked me for identification showing
 I was 18. I asked her why and was stunned when she told me: “It gets 
hot when you cook it – and you may burn yourself”. Surely the same can 
be said of many of the products they sell in any supermarket? Health and
 safety has gone crazy if you now have to prove you can be trusted with a
 chocolate pudding.’

He added: ‘I explained that I didn’t 
have any ID. Thankfully she agreed that I looked over 18 and she scanned
 her staff pass to approve the sale.’

Mr Nemeti managed to cook and eat the dessert that evening without injury.

Tesco said: ‘The self service machines
 can be temperamental. The pudding should not be an age-restricted 
product. It’s a mystery why the machine prompted staff to ask for ID.’
