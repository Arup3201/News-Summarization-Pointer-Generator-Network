Kathryn Anne Fisher, 20, wept as she was told she should be 'thoroughly ashamed of herself' after she admitted theft at Mold Crown Court today

A school secretary has been found guilty of stealing £3,400 of children’s dinner money in order to bankroll herself because she 'couldn't manage her finances'.

Kathryn Anne Fisher, 20, wept as she was told she should be 'thoroughly ashamed of herself' after she admitted theft at Mold Crown Court today.

The court heard she had abused a position of trust as the school secretary at Pentre Broughton County Primary School near Wrexham.

An audit showed discrepancies of £11,600 but Fisher was charged with stealing £3,395, the money which had been paid into her account.

Judge Nicolas Parry told her that she should be 'thoroughly ashamed of yourself.'

'This was despicable behaviour, serious dishonesty, theft in breach of a high degree of trust.'

But the judge said he believed the secretary, who was of previous good character, was truly sorry for her actions. He said: 'I accept that you are truly remorseful.'

Judge
 Parry said that she was only 20, and had been a hard-working young 
woman, who had acted out of character because she was incapable of 
managing her own financial affairs.

He said that the thefts were carried out repeatedly over a nine month period in multiple transactions.

The thefts were of monies collected from children. 'You would have known that your criminality was highly likely to have an impact upon children, the reputation of the school and upon the reputation of the staff,' Judge Parry told her.

The judge said that it may be that the school processes could have been stricter.

'But it is a sad state of affairs if a head teacher at the school cannot trust a member of its staff,' he said.

The greatest mitigation was her guilty pleas at the first opportunity for which she would receive maximum credit.

She received an eight month youth custody sentence, suspended for 12 months, and was ordered to carry out 300 hours unpaid work.

The judge said that she should be 'extremely grateful' to her grandfather who had offered to pay the compensation.

He ordered compensation in full within three months. He said a further claim by the school to pay for temporary cover while the defendant was suspended was properly made but he would not order that be paid because of her lack of means.

Sarah Morgan, prosecuting, said that Fisher, of Pentre Broughton, admitted 18 charges of theft amounting to £3,395 during a nine month period from Black Lane primary.

She was appointed secretary and administrator responsible for money collected, and enter it on daily spreadsheets ready to be banked by the head.

The school became aware that sheets had been filled in incorrectly, an audit was undertaken and discrepancies of £11,600 was discovered.

She had been charged with the money that had been paid into her bank.

Initially she denied doing anything wrong but in November made admissions of taking money to fund her life-style.

It was a small school with about 150 pupils.

Mark Davies, defending, said that Fisher - who had led an unblemished life - had started to take money with the intention of repaying it.

He handed in references and a letter from the defendant - together with a copy of the local newspaper which had caused great shame and embarrassment, the whole family had been affected by the report.

As a result of which there has been abuse, threats and indeed has resulted in causing Miss Fisher so much distress that she made an attempt to take an overdose, he said.

She had been employed for a comparatively short period of time and the auditor’s report showed that she had been able to take advantage of the fact that controls abound banking and reconciliation were weak at the school.

If there had been a greater degree of supervision, the matter would not have gone on for so long and the amounts would have been less, it was claimed.

'I am not for a second trying to blame other people for what she has done,' he explained.
