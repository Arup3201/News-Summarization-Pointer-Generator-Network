Alex proudly dressed up as his favorite
superhero, Robin. He was met by Batman who led the boy on an adventure he would
never forget.

Together, the pair fought cowboys
and pirates.  He was then sworn in by the
Anaheim Police Department as a real crime fighter.

After fighting villains in Buena
Park, California, he was taken by helicopter to Angel Stadium and then returned
to the police department to find a Batmobile waiting for him.

Batman and Robin drove the Batmobile
around Orange County.

‘I feel really thankful for the foundation,’ said
Alex after his day of fighting crime.

His mother, Elizabeth Stoffer, was
overwhelmed with joy. ‘I’m beyond emotion, my heart’s going to pop out of my
chest,’ she said.
