Liverpool are making their play to sign Norway starlet Martin Odegaard after he arrived for a tour of the club on Wednesday.

The 15-year-old, who has already spent time with Real Madrid and Manchester United - although United hope to see him again - landed on Merseyside to take a look at Liverpool's ground and facilities.

Liverpool's first team squad and staff were given the day off but Stromsgodset midfielder Odegaard, supposedly a Liverpool fan, and his father took the opportunity to look around Anfield, Melwood and Liverpool city centre.
