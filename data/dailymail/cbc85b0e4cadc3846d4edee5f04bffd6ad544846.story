Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet has warned his first-team hopefuls to be ready as he considers making changes for Monday night's trip to Crystal Palace.

The Uruguayan has presided over an 8-0 horror show at Southampton and last weekend's error-strewn 2-0 home reverse at the hands of Arsenal, with keeper Vito Mannone and central defender Wes Brown among the guilty men as the Black Cats contributed to their own downfall.

Mannone was one of the heroes of last season's Capital One Cup run and remarkable Barclays Premier League survival fight, but with understudy Costel Pantilimon breathing down his neck, he could find himself sitting on the bench at Selhurst Park.

Pantilimon, a summer arrival from Manchester City, is yet to make a Premier League appearance for the club with his only involvement to date coming in the League Cup, but Poyet wants the giant Romanian - and any other player with hopes of forcing their way into his plans - to be prepared.

He said: 'That's something we will know if he plays and how he performs. I tell my son to be ready - imagine my players.

'Be ready, then if I give you the chance and you are not ready, you cannot blame me. I cannot send you a text, an e-mail, WhatsApp, whatever you want, to make sure that you're ready.

'It's part of the job. A few players are pushing for their places and I need to make sure that I pick the right team.'

Mannone endured an intensely difficult day at the St Mary's Stadium with three of the goals he conceded being scored by his own team-mates, and it was he who served up the ball to Gunners midfielder Alexis Sanchez to score at the death last Saturday after Brown had done much the same before the break. 

But Poyet, who insisted before the Arsenal game that he would not drop the Italian because of one sub-standard performance - but might if his dip in form continued, will not make a snap decision.

He said: 'I will look at the decision and I am going to make a strong decision either way. Keeping Vito or not playing him is a strong decision because he's a very important player. You will know on Monday night.'

Poyet seems certain to make changes, although given that injuries continue to deprive him of the services of defenders Billy Jones and Sebastian Coates and midfielders Ricky Alvarez and Emanuele Giaccherini, his options are decidedly limited.

However, he has had one piece of good news this week with striker Steven Fletcher, who announced his return to the side with a double in the 3-1 victory over Stoke on October 4, having shaken off the foot problem which curtailed his involvement against Arsenal.

Poyet said: 'Fletch is back and he has been training this week similar to before Stoke, so I am really looking forward to seeing Fletch on the pitch on Monday.'
