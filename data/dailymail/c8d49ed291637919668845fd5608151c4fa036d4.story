A leading Iranian scientist being held in the U.S. over claims that he tried to buy equipment for Iran's rogue nuclear program, was released as part of deal to ease tensions.

Mojtaba Atarodi was arrested in 2011 but in April the microchip expert at a Tehran university was allowed to return to his home country.

The release was engineered as a way to bridge the distance between the U.S. and Iran, according to The Times of Israel.

Exchange: Iranian scientist Mojtaba Atarodi is released in April after being arrested in the U.S.

The newspaper claimed that Atarodi's return to Iran was part of secret negotiations between the two countries which led to the interim deal this month over Iran's nuclear ambitions.

A series of prisoner releases by both sides is believed to have played a central role in the negotiations in Geneva.

Still trapped: Robin Levinson disappeared in 2007

Hikers Sarah Shourd and Shane Bauer were among the American prisoners released by Iran in 2010 and 2012.

The U.S. has been holding secret 
meetings with the Iranians in Oman for a few years, intelligence analyst
 Ronen Solomon told The Times of Israel.

He claimed that as a result of those meetings, the two countries had swapped prisoners, with all of them traveling through Oman.

The prisoners swaps were linked to the accord agreed in Geneva last week calls for Tehran to suspend uranium enrichment for weapons and take several other steps to prove it is working towards a more permanent solution.

In exchange, relief from some economic sanctions will be provided.

The deal was struck after months of secret negotiations between officials from both Iran and the US, and finalized during talks involving five other world powers last Sunday in Geneva.

Atarodi, who had a Green Card, was arrested for allegedly trying to buy equipment that could be used in the Iranian nuclear weapons program.

As well as Atarodi, last year the U.S. freed Shahrzad Mir Gholikhan, who was convicted of three counts of weapons trafficking; Nosratollah Tajik, and Amir Hossein Seirafi.

Tajik, a former ambassador to Jordan, was initially caught attempting to buy night-vision goggles from U.S. agents. He was later released after the U.S. decided not to follow up an extradition request it submitted to the British.

Seirafi was released in January after being arrested in Germany and convicted in the U.S. of attempting to buy specialized vacuum pumps that could be used in the Iranian nuclear program.

Three Americans - Robert Levinson, Amir Hekmati, and Saeed Abedini - are currently imprisoned in Iran.

This month Mr Levinson, who disappeared in 2007, will become one of the longest-held Americans in history passing the 2,454 days Terry Anderson spent in captivity before being freed by Islamic militants in Lebanon in 1991, CNN reported.

Jailed: Christian pastor Saeed Abedini was sentenced to eight years in prison by an Iranian court this year

Spy claim: U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati was arrested in 2011

Mr Abedini, a Christian pastor, was 
sentenced to eight years' prison by an Iranian court for allegedly 
trying to undermine the government.

Former
 U.S. Marine Mr Hekmati was arrested by Iran in 2011, on accusations of 
being a spy when he visited the country to see his grandmother. 

A spokesman for the state department said on Tuesday that while the recent talks had 'focused exclusively on nuclear issues, but we have raised - repeatedly raised - his case and the cases of other detained American citizens including Amir Hekmati and Saeed Abedini in our bilateral discussions with Iran, including President Obama’s phone call with President Rouhani in September, so as recently as then, and we will continue to do so.'
