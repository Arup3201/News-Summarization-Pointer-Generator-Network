Imagine riding more than 30 different horses across a treacherous path that stretches more than 1000 kilometres across the Mongolian wilderness on a trip that lasts nearly a fortnight.

Each year, more than 30 people from around the world do just that when they take part in the Mongol Derby - the longest and toughest horse race in the world - and this year, for the first time ever, an Australian woman beat all of fierce the competition to come in first place.

This week Sam Jones, from Western Australia, became the second woman and first Australian to complete the race in the fastest time since its inception in 2009.

The 40-year-old escaped without a scratch on her - unlike some of her fellow competitors some of whom had to be airlifted out of the race while others were hospitalised

'It was the most exhilarating, invigorating experience of my life', Ms Jones told Daily Mail Australia.

'I did not go in to this thinking I'm going to win this - the first priority is to survive it and not come home with a permanent injury.'

The 40-year-old escaped without a scratch on her, unlike some of her fellow competitors, some of whom had to be airlifted out of the race while others were hospitalised.

Each year only about 30 percent of riders finish, but Ms Jones said nearly 60 percent of her fellow competitors got across the line this year.

The derby is run by British Firm The Adventurists, and the path changes every year. Riders navigate between 25 stations refueling and changing horses and is based on the long-distance postal system implemented in the area back in the 1200s.

The whole journey is demanding physically, but also mentally as competitors have to navigate their way between stations and eventually to the finish line. They can stay with local herders along the way or sleep under the stars with their steeds.

'Winning it was amazing, but I was almost sad to cross the finish line, I wanted to keep going, I didn't want it to end!' Ms Jones revealed.

While some competitors stuck together during the race, the West Australian woman completed the bulk of the 1000 kilometres on her own and said she managed her horses better this way.

Each rider works their way through around 30 different horses, who are much tougher than any of the animals Ms Jones is used to riding back home.

'The horses are the star of the show there, they're so incredibly tough.'

'It's incredible what they can cope with... They galloped over ground I would have hesitated to walk over,' she said.

Riders track between 25 stations to change to ride as many as 30 horses and refuel throughout 10 days

More than 30 people from around the world take part every year - but less than 50 per cent finish actually finish the treacherous race

The race is held every August in the vast Mongolian wilderness stretching more than 1000 kilometres

As a whole, Ms Jones said the experience was unlike anything she'd every been through in her life, and has signed up to take on the derby every 10 years.

She said she would love to do it more often, but the hefty price tag is a bit of a deterrent.

'The entry fees are about $14,000 but when you consider what they provide and every ride needs 30 horses each ... It pays for the horses, all the people to look after them, all the people to look after those people, the vets, the medics.'

Ms Jones also revealed the incredible bonds that were forged between fellow riders over a relatively short time - just 10 days - and said she's made friends for life.

She also told of the incredible strength of her fellow competitors, and the real danger the race can present.

'There was a lady who turned 61 on the last day of the race and she rode with the leaders most of the time but took two very heavy falls... The horses bucked her off.

'I might have won, but there were others who did far more amazing things,' Ms Jones said.

Ms Jones said she didn't go out there to come in first but when she crossed the line she felt as if she could have ridden another 1000 kilometres
