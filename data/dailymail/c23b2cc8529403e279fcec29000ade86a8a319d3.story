Ugly and misshapen fruit and vegetables could make a return to supermarket shelves after the summer floods hit this year’s harvest.

Farmers and ministers are urging supermarkets to stop throwing away thousands of tonnes of perfectly edible food just because of the way it looks.

It means shoppers could be loading their baskets with rude shaped vegetables which used to dominate TV shows like That’s Life.

Knobbly carrots and mis-shapen apples could be back on supermarket shelves as farmers struggle to cope with the impact of the wet summer

Farming minister David Heath said: ‘Ugly veg is still tasty veg, and there is absolutely no reason it should not be sold. We need to bear down on waste at all points in the food chain.’

The government’s Love Food Hate Waste campaign is now working with retailers to cut the amount of edible food which is thrown away.

UK supermarkets set much higher standards for the way food looks than is required by the European Union, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said.

‘Due to the difficult weather conditions across Northern Europe this year, many retailers are working with farmers to market fruit and vegetables which are less cosmetically perfect but still healthy and sound.’

This could mean allowing products which are ‘larger/smaller, shorter/rounder or storm marked’.

Shoppers will be told that while these products ‘may not look as pretty but taste just as good and are good for you’.

The return of mis-shapen food raises the prospect of amusing additions to shopping baskets. This tomato became an internet hit after keen gardeners Eric and Diane Hinchliffe from Lincolnshire noticed it looked like a rubber duck and the pig-shaped carrot belonged to Ann Miller of Seaford

EU marketing standards set out the specific size and shape for the 10 most consumed products including apples, pears, strawberries, citrus, table grapes, peaches, kiwifruit, lettuces tomatoes and sweet peppers.

Tory MP Laura Sandys, who set up a campaign called Ugly Food, said rising food prices and the impact of floods on harvests means shoppers will be forced to lowers their standards.

‘The idea that you look on an apple or a banana as beautiful could now finally be over. You wonder if we have also taken some of the taste out of our fruit and veg as a result of the pursuit of aesthetically beautiful food.

‘We cannot afford to be doing this these days. I hope that what is happening now is supermarkets are taking this lower standard food.’

Campaigners argue that food which had grown oddly will still taste good

Farmers have warned of rising food prices as a result of the summer’s floods.

An NFU spokesman said: ‘The wet weather over the summer was far from ideal and certainly presented a huge challenge for many of our growers. 

‘We would urge retailers to apply a sensible level of flexibility on their product specifications to ensure that as much of the British crop that is available makes its way onto the supermarket shelves for consumers to enjoy.’

Last month a survey by the National Farmers’ Union showed wheat yields had fallen by 14.1 per cent this year, after England and Wales suffered the wettest summer for 100 years.

In the North West farmers warned they could lose hundreds of thousands of pounds and face financial ruin.
