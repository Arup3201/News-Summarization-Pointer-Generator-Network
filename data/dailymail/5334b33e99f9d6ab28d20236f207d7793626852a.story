The heartbroken parents of schoolgirl April Jones have released unseen pictures of the missing five-year-old to mark two months since she disappeared.

April, five, was last seen playing near her parents' house in Machynlleth, West Wales, two months ago tomorrow, before she vanished without a trace.

Her devastated parents Coral and Paul have refused to give up hope she will be found, and an illuminated pink star lit in April's memory is part of the Christmas decorations in her hometown.

Distressing: April shortly before she vanished, left, and as a toddler, right, with mother Coral, who has released a set of touching photos for the two-month anniversary of her daughter's disappearance

'Little monkey': April's family hope the pictures may prompt someone to come forward with information about the whereabouts of the five-year-old

Poignant pictures: Devastated Mrs Jones called this image 'April the water baby'

Her grandmother Lyn Smith said: 'We are all trying to keep strong and hoping April will soon be returned to us.'

The family today released previously unseen pictures of the adorable schoolgirl, who was last seen on October 1.

One of the pictures shows Mrs Jones, 43, hugging April while on a family outing in the country.

Another shows her lovingly cradling her daughter, who was just a toddler when the photo was taken.

There is also a picture of April swinging on a climbing frame - a scene Mrs Jones calls 'April the little monkey'.

Another shows the little girl playing on the beach and in the sea, which her mother labels 'April water baby'.

Determined: The police search continues and the force say they have no plans to scale down the operation

Mr and Mrs Jones hope the images may prompt someone to come forward with fresh information about April.

They have been to see the pink star in the town where a major search operation is still going on.

Pink was April's favourite colour and has become the symbol of the search for her.

Dyfed Powys Police said they have 16 search teams out every Monday to Friday looking for the girl.

The operation, this week included around 130 officers, from Scotland, Northern Ireland and England as well as Wales.

A spokesman said: 'We will continue searching as long as we have viable lines of inquiry.

'We are committed to doing all we can to bring the search operation to a successful conclusion.'

Loved: April, left, and with her father Paul, right. April went missing while playing near her home in the Bryn Y 
Gog estate in Machynlleth, Wales

Hopeful: The youngster's grandmother said the family are trying to stay strong
