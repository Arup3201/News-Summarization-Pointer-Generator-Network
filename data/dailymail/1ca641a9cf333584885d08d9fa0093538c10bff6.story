Donor: Jemima Layzell's organs were donated after she died from a brain haemorrhage aged just 13

A 13-year-old schoolgirl who died from a brain haemorrhage saved the lives of eight people by opting to donate her organs.

Jemima Layzell had discussed organ donation with her parents and told them she wanted her body to help save others in the event of her death.

And when the healthy teenager suddenly collapsed at home in Horton, Somerset, and died in hospital from a massive bleed in her brain, her parents decided to honour her wish. 

Since her death her heart has gone to a five-year-old boy, a 14-year-old was given her lungs and her liver was split between two boys, aged ten months and five.

Two people, aged 19 and 24, received her kidneys, a 40-year-old man was given her pancreas and her small bowel has changed the life of a boy aged three-and-a-half.

Jemima - who aspired to become an author - also donated eye tissue which will help restore the sight of two people.

Her proud parents, photographer Harvey, 43, and mum Sophy, 38, today paid tribute to their daughter, who passed away on March 14.

They said: 'Jemima was lovely - clever, funny, compassionate and creative.

'She was a brilliant artist but planned to be an author and left many poems, songs, stories and also serious thoughts about her life and the world's problems and delights.

'She also thought about and discussed death and said of her wish to be an organ donor when she died.

Jemima, 13, was a fit and active teenager when she collapsed at her family home in Horton, Somerset

'Eight people have benefited from vital parts of her beautiful young healthy body, including five young children.

'Jemima was much loved, was fiercely loyal and cherished her many friends and sister Amelia.

'She has left a lasting legacy and example to others, by being an organ donor.

'It is so sad and we all miss her terribly and it seems such a waste of wonderful potential, but Jemima's short life was so full of joy and achievement and finally such generosity - to be celebrated and always remembered.'

Jemima collapsed at home 'without warning' during early evening preparations for her mum Sophy's 38th birthday party on March 10.

She had extreme pain in her head and lost consciousness. The teenager had suffered a massive bleed caused by a ruptured giant aneurysm deep in the left side of her brain.

Jemima had a close group of friends at Taunton School and enjoyed reading and writing in her diary

Her horrified family called 999 and Jemima was rushed to Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton, Somerset, and later transferred to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol.

She passed away at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children at 4.28pm on March 14 as she could not recover from the effects of the major haemorrhage.

Her parents said 'beloved and courageous' Jemima, a pupil of £15,000-per-year Taunton School, had 'spurred' her mother into co-founding MAdD performing arts school.

She regularly modelled for her father's photography studios, Gorilla Photographic Studios.

They added: 'We are so glad to have so many wonderful pictures of Jemima, feeling beautiful and being creative.

'She was quite serious but also enjoyed silly games, consequences, paper games, treasure hunts and tree climbing.

'She usually carted around a large bag with school essentials, her private diary and several books.

'On the day she died the books were Milton's 'Paradise Lost' and 'The Right to Write'.'

Jemima, who has a sister Amelia, kept a detailed diary which her parents now hope to get published.

A memorial will be held for her at Taunton School Chapel on May 21 at 4pm.
