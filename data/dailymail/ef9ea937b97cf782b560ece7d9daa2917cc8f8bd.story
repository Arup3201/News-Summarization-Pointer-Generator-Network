Cara has one and so does Miley, but if you're contemplating giving someone onesie for Christmas, it might be time to think again.

According to a new survey, the all-in-one is the present that the majority of us would least like to find under the tree come Wednesday.

Over a third said they wouldn't be happy to unwrap one - even a luxury version such as Marks & Spencer's Â£199 cashmere offering.

Don't do it! Unlike the members of One Direction, most of us won't be pleased to find a onesie under the tree

No thanks! Even M&S's Â£199 cashmere onesie could prove unpopular if added to the present pile

But onesies weren't the only ones to appear at the top of the Christmas gift blacklist.

Close behind all-in-ones were celebrity weight loss DVDs, which 32 per cent said they wouldn't want to find under the tree.

In third place were novelty Christmas jumpers, hand-knitted or otherwise, which were chosen by 12 per cent of those asked.

Also unpopular were socks of any kind and celebrity cook books.

But for those hoping to avoid onesies and celebrity workout DVDs are likely to be disappointed: two thirds of us receive at least one gift we don't want every Christmas, according to the research by British Heart Foundation shops.

Grandparents are the worst gift givers, with 12 per cent handing over stuff which is not wanted.

They are followed by mothers, also with 12 per cent of the vote, and spouses who were nominated by seven per cent of those quizzed by the charity.

Bad idea: Celebrity fitness DVDs and cook books also proved to be unpopular choices

But some good can come out of recieving a dodgy Christmas gift, with the British Heart Foundation urging people to donate unwanted presents to their shops to help fund life-saving research.

Commenting on the survey, British Heart Foundation retail director Mike Taylor said: 'People often receive perfectly good gifts that are just not to their taste or are the wrong size. Or they even get two of the same thing.

'We encourage them to donate these items to BHF shops so unwanted Christmas gifts can help in the fight against heart disease.'
