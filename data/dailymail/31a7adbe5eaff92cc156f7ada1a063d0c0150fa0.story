Australian aircraft have been pumping out toxic fumes, exposing passengers and crew to chemicals more than 1000 times over the past five years, it has been claimed.

And customers aboard flights are not always about the dangers, a report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau has revealed.

Some airline staff are seeking legal action over fears that the fumes and exposure to radiation could be leading to an increased risk of brain and breast cancer.

Toxic: The BAe146 aircraft has been named as one of the worst offenders for fume emission

Brett Vollus, who worked for Qantas for 27, is preparing a case after being diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour

The news comes as a flight attendant, who is trying to prove a link between pesticides sprayed on international flights and his Parkinsonâ€™s disease, has been diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour.

Brett Vollus, who worked for Qantas for 27 years, said: 'I was only diagnosed with the brain tumour when I tripped because of the Parkinson's and went to hospital for a scan.'

He is preparing a case against the government in a bid to know more.

'There has to be a link between these brain tumours and cancers among flight crew and the toxic environment that we are working in,' he said.

Meanwhile, a former pilot, who collapsed from aerotoxic syndrome after repeated exposure to fumes from heated jet oil in the cockpit of the BAe146 aircraft, has claimed: 'Being exposed to chemicals every day made me sick'.

Susan Michaelis is now head of research at the Global Cabin Air Quality Executive and says her research has found clusters of cancer and neurological problems among flight crew.

'There is a pattern of chronic ill-health... and it needs to be looked at further,' Ms Michaelis told News.com.

The report named the BAe146 aircraft as one of the worst offenders for fume emission, although no individual airlines have been singled out.

Independent analysis of the ATSB figures shows the Boeing 767 also had 123 fumes exposures from less than 20 planes between 2008 and 2013.

Qantas is phasing out their Boeing 767 but has denied the plane was any worse than other aircraft types.

'Fume incidences across the Qantas fleet are extremely rare, particularly those from engine oil,' Qantas medical services director Dr Ian Hosegood said.

In December 2013, five flight attendants who have developed Parkinson's - including Mr Vollus - contacted law firm Turner Freeman to ask about taking legal action against the Commonwealth government.

They want to know more about the links between Parkinson's and the spraying of insecticides on flights in line with World Health Organisation guidelines to prevent the spread of potentially deadly mosquito-borne viruses.

Turner Freeman lawyer Tanya Segelov told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'When Brett was diagnosed, his neurologist asked him what he did, and he said he worked for Qantas, and his response was: "Oh, another one,"'

'We have now had four more long-haul flight attendants come forward this morning, and I think we are going to see more and more people coming out of the woodwork.'
