Ring master? Federal officials are looking into the possible existence of a pedophile ring involving convicted child molester Jerry Sandusky

A man has come forward alleging he saw Jerry Sandusky and a prominent Penn State University donor sexually abusing two boys together aboard a private plane, it was claimed on Monday.

The FBI is reportedly taking the accusations 'seriously,' and has opened an investigation into a pedophile sex ring that could spread beyond the former Penn State football coach.

Until now, authorities have believed that Sandusky was a lone abuser. The newest allegations threaten bring out more horrifying revelations about sexual abuse surrounding the once-prestigious college athletics program.

RadarOnline.com reports that the witness, who has business ties to the Penn State booster, told postal inspectors and the FBI that he was aboard the private plane when the alleged abuse occurred.

He said he remained silent about what he saw until now and does not know whether the boys are new victims or if they have already been identified as having been abused by the former defensive coordinator.

'If the Feds can prove what this witness is saying then a sickening situation just got worse,' an anonymous source told Radar.

'The witness does not know who the boys are and if they were from Sandusky's Second Mile charity. He can prove his tie to the booster but the Feds are going to have to prove the rest.'

According to Radar Online, federal authorities are looking into the possibility that Sandusky shared his young victims with other pedophiles including a 'very rich, very powerful man connected with the university.'

Grave allegations: Sources close to the investigation say a prominent man with close ties to Penn State may have been involved in the alleged sex ring

University boosters used to be content cheering for their college sports team and organizing fundraisers. However, in recent years, wealthy donors have been more active in major university athletics.

In many cases, their money buys them access to coaches and players and influence the decisions of university administrators. In years past, scandal has erupted at other universities when boosters have used their cash and power to woo college players with cars, cash and other gifts.

Until now, authorities have always thought Jerry Sandusky did his terrible deeds alone.

However, the new allegations threaten to widen the horrific scandal -- possibly implicating a wealthy donor in sex abuse itself.

University officials, including legendary coach Joe Paterno himself, have been accused of covering up and not acting on allegations that Sandusky was abusing young boys.

Only Sandusky, though, has been accused of committing the actual abuse.

In June, Sandusky, the former defensive coordinator for the Penn State football team, was convicted of 45 counts of sexual abuse for molesting 10 boys.

Prosecutors say Sandusky met his victims at the Second Mile, a charity he founded for under-privileged children. 

Sandusky has not cooperated with authorities and has denied he ever sexually abused children.

Investigators with the US Postal Service are also examining Sandusky. They have seized his computers and are looking into allegations that he sent 'seductive letters' across state lines -- including to some of his victims.

Federal investigators are currently working to verify the allegations against the booster, who remains unnamed. The alleged witness reportedly included specific information like times and places.

Radar Online said investigators were starting with the known victims because the eyewitness didn't know who the boys were.

'This
 interview did not take place in the state of Pennsylvania and there are
 documents linking the eyewitness to the man he claims abused children 
with Sandusky. There is enough evidence that this is being taken very, 
very seriously.'

The booster allegedly involved with 
Sandusky is described as a 'very rich and powerful man connected with 
the university,' Radar reports.

The news comes a little over a month 
after Sandusky, 68, was convicted on 45 counts of child sexual abuse for
 molesting 10 boys over the course of 15 years.

The United States Postal Inspectors 
office in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, has spearheaded the investigation 
because pornographic materials involving underage boys
 have allegedly been sent through the mail.

Analyzing
 a computer seized from Sandusky, investigators are also looking into 
whether he sent ‘seductive letters’ across state lines for sexual 
purposes, according to CBS. Some of these letters were said to be sent to some of his 
victims.

Tensions: Paterno hardly got along with his former assistant Jerry Sandusky, left, even before allegations of child sex abuse were raised

In custody: Sandusky's attorneys have indicated that they will appeal his conviction

‘The investigation
 is in its early stages,’ the source added. ‘They have not yet cast a 
wide net but it is ongoing and it is serious.’

Sandusky is expected to be sentenced 
to a life in prison for sexually abusing underage boys. Many of the 
victims came from the Second Mile charity, which Sandusky founded in 
1977 to help troubled youth.

Penn State representatives were not immediately available to comment on the investigation.

Meanwhile, a status conference has 
been scheduled for September 7 in a Pennsylvania courtroom as Second 
Mile seeks to shut down and transfer its assets.

Sandusky’s charity is hoping to give 
its assets to Houston-based Arrow Child & Family Ministries Inc., 
but lawyers for some of the child abuse victims have objected.

With Sandusky facing 442 years 
in prison, his legal team has raised an argument about the disgraced 
ex-Penn State football coach’s speedy trial that may become the thrust 
of an appeal.
