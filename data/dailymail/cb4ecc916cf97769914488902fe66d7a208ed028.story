Two years after a shocking doping scandal forced him from the charity he created, former elite cyclist Lance Armstrong may start a new cancer foundation if he is not allowed to return to the iconic Livestrong brand.

Armstrong, 42, recently told reporters he was weighing his options as the people in charge of Livestrong consider his potential future involvement.

He told the Des Moines Register that 'if I'm not welcome' he would likely either start a new foundation 'which is probably the most likely scenario, or just be willing and able to help, wherever I'm asked.'

Livestrong President Doug Ulman recently told Esquire that Armstrong could potentially return to the foundation.

However Chairman Jeff Garvey said that a reconciliation was 'not on the table.'

Armstrong was removed from the charity in November 2012 just one month after the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency hit him with a lifetime competition ban and he was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles.

He founded the Lance Armstrong Foundation after his own battle with testicular cancer in 1997.

Based in his hometown of Austin, Texas, it's raised more than an estimated $500 million.

He claims to have used $7 million to $8 million of his own money to seed the foundation.

Armstrong said that even the possibility of a return was shocking.

'I
 was surprised by that. That was never the impression I'd been given,' Armstrong said. 'To see the follow-up statement by the chairman, Jeff Garvey, 
that was more in line with where I think they are.

'That's beyond 
my control. I can't force that issue. But what I can do (is) stay 
committed to the fight, stay committed to the cause.'

Armstrong said he was still uncertain how he would respond to an invitation to return and that any answer would 'involve a lot of conversation.'

'I'm a big believer in the whole (author) Jim 
Collins theory of 'Who's on the bus? Who'd been on the bus? Who wanted 
to get off the bus? Who wants to get off the bus now?' he said. 'So we might have 
to look at who's on the bus.'

However he acknowledge it was, at best, a remote possibility.

'I don't see that happening anytime soon. In fact, I'm almost certain that's not going to happen,' he said.

He refuses to let that stop him from engaging with people battling cancer.

'I think it's convenient for them to put me on the sidelines,' he said. 'But I'm not staying on the sidelines.'
