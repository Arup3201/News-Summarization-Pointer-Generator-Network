Unrest in Ferguson, Missouri was exacerbated on Wednesday night when Darren Wilson supporters showed up to a Michael Brown rally, sparking tensions. 

The small group of pro-Wilson supporters arrived after dark in the rally area, with one woman in a rainbow-striped shirt holding up a sign criticizing the governor's reaction to the police-shooting death: 'Vigorous prosecution Jay Nixon? Justice is for everybody even P.O. Wilson'.

A video post to YouTube shows the woman and another man getting into a verbal argument with Brown protesters, before they were escorted from the scene by police. They are identified as Chuck and Dawn of St Louis, in the video's caption.

Not a good idea: A pro-Darren Wilson protester is escorted away from a Michael Brown rally on Wednesday August 20. It does not appear this is the woman who was hit in the head

Message: This particular protesters held up a sign reading: 'Vigorous prosecution Jay Nixon? Justice is for everybody even P.O. Wilson'

It appears another woman came to the protest in defense of Wilson, according to the Washington Post
 which reported she was hit over the head while waving a 'I support 
Darren Wilson' sign and shouting, 'Y'all need to get your facts 
straight'.

Police to rush to her side after she was hit, put her in a truck and drove her away.

'That sign was meant to provoke us. I asked the police why are you letting her protest causing problems over here?' said 30-year-old Tenisha Wheeler said: 'I wouldn’t dare go to a rally supporting Wilson with my own self.'

Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson praised members of the clergy, who were seen in the crowd, helping direct the march and acting as intermediaries between police and demonstrators.

One black female minister in a long white robe calmed a woman who was screaming defiantly, then ushered her along the route.

Meanwhile, new details were released on the injuries Wilson, 28, allegedly 
sustained in his deadly confrontation with Brown.

Wilson was reportedly badly beaten and left with serious facial injuries following the fatal 
shooting in the St Louis suburb, including an eye socket fracture. The 
officer was almost knocked unconscious by Brown's blows, according to 
the source.

The
 leaked information on Wilson's injuries added yet another dimension to 
the fatal shooting on August 9 as Attorney-General Eric Holder arrived 
in Ferguson on Wednesday to oversee a federal investigation into the cop 
killing which has ignited Ferguson into violent, racially-charged 
protests.

A police source told Fox: 'The Assistant (Police) Chief took him to the hospital, his face all swollen on one side. He was beaten very severely.'

The source 
continued: 'They ignored him [Wilson] and the officer started to get out
 of the car to tell them to move. They shoved him right back in, that’s 
when Michael Brown leans in and starts beating Officer Wilson in the 
head and the face.'

ABC News also reported on Wednesday that a police source revealed Officer Wilson suffered a 'serious facial injury'.

The Gateway Pundit reported on Tuesday that the officer had suffered an 'orbital blowout fracture'. 

A
 police source has confirmed to MailOnline that Wilson was taken to 
hospital and treated for facial injuries sustained during the Brown 
incident but would not elaborate on the severity or nature of those 
injuries.

Some protesters returned to the streets on Wednesday evening but in diminished numbers, they marched around a single block as a thunderstorm filled the sky with lighting and dumped rain

Ferguson officer Darren Wilson had 'severe facial injuries' after being beaten by Michael Brown, a police source said on Wednesday 

Michael Brown, 18, reportedly badly beat Officer Wilson before he was shot dead on August 9

Last week, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson had suffered swelling to the side of his face but gave few details of the injuries.

Wilson, a six-year veteran of the Ferguson force with a clean record, has not been arrested or charged with any crime. 

He is on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation and is under 24-hour guard after death threats were aimed at him. 

Wilson is 'traumatized, scared for his life and his family' along with being deeply concerned that a grand jury, which met for the first time on Wednesday, will make an example out of him, the source told Fox. 

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has come under fire after calling for the 'vigorous prosecution' of Wilson despite the fact that the officer has not yet been charged with any crime.

His deputy, Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder said: 'It's really heartbreaking to see a man elected to an office that high in our state government... come out with a statement like that, that does prejudge the case.' 

St Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said on Wednesday he estimated it would be the middle of October before the grand jury reached a decision on whether Officer Wilson will face charges over Michael Brown's death.

Some protesters returned to the streets on Wednesday evening but in diminished numbers. They marched around a single block as a thunderstorm filled the sky with lighting and dumped rain. Police still stood guard, but many wore regular uniforms rather than riot gear.

Officer Darren Wilson was caught on cellphone footage looking at Michael Brown's lifeless body after he fired six shots at the unarmed teen on a Ferguson street on August 9. One witness said the cop appeared to be 'bewildered' and 'in disbelief'

A tribute has been left on Canfield Avenue in Ferguson where Michael Brown was shot dead on August 9

On August 
9, Officer Wilson had been attending a separate medical emergency call 
shortly before midday. He left that incident and came across Michael 
Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson walking in the middle of Canfield 
Avenue in Ferguson. 

According
 to Fox, the police source said Brown and Johnson ignored him. As the 
officer began to get out of his car, Brown leaned into the patrol 
vehicle and began beating the officer. 

The
 pair struggled over the officer's gun, which Wilson reportedly claimed 
that Brown had tried to grab. The gun went off but it has not been 
determined who pulled the trigger. 

According
 to reports, from police sources and friends of Wilson, the teen then 
challenged the officer with the words: 'What you're going to shoot me?' 
before charging at him. 

Officer Wilson shot Brown, who was
 6'4' and weighed 292lbs, at least six times including two shots to the 
head with a 'kill shot' penetrating the top of his skull, according to 
an independent autopsy report earlier this week from the Brown family.

Several eye-witnesses of the shooting have come forward with contradictory versions of events.

Bystanders said Brown had turned towards the police officer with his arms raised in surrender when he was shot dead. 

Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Brown's family, has said the 18-year-old's funeral and memorial service would be Monday. The time and location had not been finalized.
