It was a moment that even the strong-willed Ben Parkinson must have doubted would ever arrive.

More than eight years after a Taliban bomb shattered his body, the extraordinary soldier has walked unsupported for the first time.

After four weeks being treated with pressurised oxygen, Lance Bombadier Parkinson’s seemingly dead nerves and muscles are regenerating like something out of science fiction.

Progress: Former paratrooper Ben Parkinson, who lost both his legs during a bomb blast, can now walk two miles using his crutches and has taken his first six steps unaided thanks to a pioneering oxygen treatment

The 30-year-old war hero has felt the tingle of nerves in his upper legs and the resulting ability to move his hips himself means he can walk on prosthetic legs without crutches.

His speech is clearer, he is regaining control and use of his left arm and, astonishingly, tiny bits of shrapnel embedded since 2006 have been emerging from his body. 

His mother Diane Dernie, 57, said: ‘We could count about 20 changes in the past month – some big, some small. What’s happening is astounding.’

The most seriously injured soldier to survive in Afghanistan, he lost both his legs and broke his back, hips and ribs, as well as suffering brain damage, when his Land Rover hit a mine. He was unconscious in a military hospital for three months.

Treatment: The 30-year-old war hero is one of the first soldiers in Britain to be given the Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT), which works to rebuild his tissues and muscles

The procedure involves sitting in a huge metal cylinder for up to two hours, during which time the patient breathes in pressurised pure oxygen

Ben underwent the treatment for six days a week over the course of the month. By the third week, he had taken the steps unaided and his speech is also said to be 'rapidly improving'

Probably the most significant moment in L/Bdr Parkinson’s long journey back from the brink came last week at the Castle Craig Hospital in Edinburgh. 

Ben Parkinson’s astonishing progress may help convince the medical establishment of the benefits of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, still regarded with suspicion by many doctors. 

Patients breathe oxygen through a mask in a chamber at twice atmospheric pressure. 

Oxygen is a key part of the healing process, helping repair and regenerate tissue and cells and reducing inflammation. 

Professor Philip James, an expert in hyperbaric medicine at the University of Dundee, says there is overwhelming evidence that brain cells can be revived and stem cells stimulated to grow new nerve cells. 

Oxygen therapy is cheap – with chambers costing as little as £45 a session – and as well being used to treat injured soldiers could help stroke patients recover. 

There were tears from him and his mother when he walked ‘three or four steps completely unsupported’ in the clinic’s gym after undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy and putting himself through eight gruelling hours of physiotherapy a day. 

Mrs Dernie said: ‘He got us all up one night saying he’d awoken because he could feel all the nerves in his legs wake up. It has been incredibly emotional.’

He has now returned home to Doncaster but will continue with his treatment at a chamber in Rotherham. 

Previously he could walk on his false legs only in a style that meant he would never be free of crutches. The development of muscles and movement in his hips has enabled him to walk in a rocking style like other amputees.

This progress is only the start. Experts hope that in the coming months there will be signs the oxygen therapy is repairing Ben’s brain damage, which has affected his memory and speech. 

Mrs Dernie, who found out about the therapy on the internet, said: ‘Ben is absolutely over the moon with his progress so far. We hope that eventually Ben’s brain will recover. It’s done wonders for the rest of his body so far so you never know.’

Ben was injured in 2006 when the Land Rover in which he was travelling hit a mine in Helmand Province
