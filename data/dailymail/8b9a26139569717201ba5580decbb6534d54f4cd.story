Brendan Rodgers is being judged too harshly because of the high standards he set last season - but he hasn't helped himself with poor signings, according to Manchester United legend Paul Scholes.

Rodgers' Liverpool side are currently 12th in the Premier League, after coming so close to winning the title last season.

But Scholes insists that while the Anfield boss is still a top manager, his signings have not been good enough.

Brendan Rodgers has come under fire for Liverpool's poor start this season in the league and Europe

Rodgers is a good manager, according to Scholes, but his signings have let him down this season

'I rate Rodgers as a manager,' Scholes wrote in the Independent. 'I liked how his Swansea team played and I think he comes across well in his press conferences. At the moment he looks more stressed out than at any point since he took the job. 

'The expectation at Liverpool got out of control last season and now, when the belief from the fans has been that they should take the next step, the team have been unable to do it.

The likes of Dejan Lovren, signed from Southampton for £20million, have performed below expectations

Last season's title challenge, led by Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge, raised the expectations at Anfield

'I go back to the signings once again. They weren’t good enough. A manager lives and dies by the players he brings in, especially when someone as big as Luis Suarez leaves. 

'For instance, the £20m price for Dejan Lovren means that instead of looking like a smart call on a player with potential, he becomes a £20m defender with all the pressure that brings.'
