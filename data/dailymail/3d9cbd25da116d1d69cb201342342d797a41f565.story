A gay British man who has flown home after being jailed in Morocco for 'homosexual acts' has described his ordeal as a 'nightmare'.

Ray Cole, 69, from Deal, Kent, was imprisoned for four months in Marrakech with his Moroccan friend after police found homosexual images on his phone.

Today, after being unexpectedly freed, he told how he was kept in 'a tank of 40 or 50 people' and said the conditions were 'indescribable', adding: 'Dickens couldn't paint it any worse'.

The grandfather, who flew home to Britain last night after being released on appeal yesterday, said he knew that homosexuality was illegal and said he and his friend, 20-year-old Jamal Jam Wald Nass, were careful to be 'discreet'.

Ray Cole, 69, from Deal, Kent, who was jailed in Marrakech for being gay, said conditions were 'indescribable' and spoke of his relief at being freed yesterday and reunited with his children Gemma and Adrian, above

Mr Cole, who is a father and grandfather, was a victim of a 'wholesale corruption', MP Nigel Evans said today

He told ITV's This Morning: 'We were doing nothing wrong.  We were totally discreet and even though we were together, we were never touching.

'I knew that homosexuality was against the law so I respected their culture. In my experience when you are discreet you don't have any trouble.

'When we were arrested I thought at any time they were going to say it was a mistake.'

Mr Cole said he and his partner were thrown into separate cells after they were stopped by officials in the street, and said he suspected the Moroccan authorities had been tipped off by a concierge at their hotel who had previously asked them for money.

He said: 'At no point was I told I had been arrested, charged, or even read my rights. I had no idea what was going on.

'My phone doesn't have a password and I've later found out that they went into everything on my phone: my Facebook and even my PayPal account.

'The first few days were the worst. I was kept in a tank of about 40 or 50 people and the conditions were indescribable. Dickens couldn't paint it any worse.

'The stench was disgusting and at night there was so much noise - people slamming doors. I was totally in shock the whole time.'

MP Nigel Evans, who is openly gay and is a parliamentary friend of Morocco, supported him on television this morning and said a 'wholesale corruption has taken place'

Ray Cole, 69, shares an emotional reunion with his family at Gatwick Airport after returning to the UK following his release from prison in Morocco where he was sentenced to four months in prison for 'homosexual acts'

He also shared an affectionate cuddle with his granddaughter Mia-Louise on his return to the United Kingdom

He said: 'I did not expect this at all - I thought I was going to be transferred to a different prison. They gave me a choice of staying in Morocco another night or getting the next flight back.

'You would not believe it, it's horrendous. It's not a prison, it's a concentration camp. People are in there from the age of ten to 80 and 90 for nothing. I can hardly move my arm from sleeping on the floor.'

When asked about the support from his family, he said: 'I'm so proud of them - I could not have a better family.'

Mr Cole was on holiday in Marrakech visiting Mr Nass, with whom he had struck up a friendship on Facebook, when they were approached by police at a bus stop on September 18.

Mr Cole, who turns 70 on October 25, was four weeks into a five-week break in the north African country when he was arrested on suspicion of being homosexual - a crime that carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison in the country.

As well as a petition, a 'Free Ray Cole' hashtag circulated on Twitter and a Facebook page was set up calling for his release. Mr Cole said he was 'relieved' to have been reunited with his family (pictured) following his release

He was sentenced, along with Mr Nass, to four months in prison on Thursday when police searched Mr Cole's mobile phone and found a photograph of the two men together.

As well as a petition, a 'Free Ray Cole' hashtag circulated on Twitter and a Facebook page was set up calling for the release of Mr Cole, who has a minor heart condition.

And yesterday the Moroccan Embassy said the retired magazine publisher had been released pending an appeal. 

A statement read: 'Access to consular assistance and a legal defence has been duly provided to Mr Cole, who has exercised his right of appeal and is due to appear in front of the Judge of the Court of Appeals tomorrow, 8 October 2014.

'In the meantime, Mr Cole is to be granted conditional release.'

Following his release, Mr Cole's son, Adrian, 41, said: 'Our legal team in Marrakesh lodged an appeal today.

'It has moved much faster than we expected and the court was able to take the step of releasing my father.

'We would like to express our gratitude as a family to the thousands of people who have offered us their support and kindness.

'I would also like to offer my thanks to the Moroccan authorities.'

It is unclear whether Mr Nass was also released.

Earlier, Adrian told how the Moroccan authorities failed to notify his family or the British Consulate of his father's arrest.

He was in fact feared missing for nearly a week before he was eventually able to get in contact using a fellow prisoner's phone.

Mr Cole had told his family that he was being forced to live on just one daily serving of boiled vegetables.

They also said he was forced to live in a dorm, designed to sleep 44 men, with 60 other men - leaving him to sleep on a concrete floor.

Charlie Elphicke, MP for Dover and Deal, is urging tourists to boycott the north African country and claimed it is 'unsafe' for British citizens.

He said: 'It seems a very medieval process to prosecute someone and convict them for being gay.

'I'm particularly concerned because Mr Cole is 70 years old, has suffered from ill health including heart conditions and strokes, and we really need to get him back to the UK as soon as possible.

'Anyone thinking of going to Morocco needs to seriously consider the nature of their laws and be very cautious when travelling.

'I do not think Morocco is a safe travel destination for tourists.'

Adrian, who works in recruitment, has been supporting his father alongside Mr Cole's daughter Gemma Cole, 37.

The grandfather-of-one's ex wife Margaret, who is also the father of his two children is also showing her support.

The pair were married for 45 years before he came out as gay a few years ago and the pair have remained good friends.

Mr Cole (pictured while on his trip in Marrakech) had been in the country for four weeks when he was arrested and had been due to fly home in five weeks

All three helped back a campaign on social networks Twitter and Facebook this week appealing for his release went viral.

Messages of support were sent from celebrities including Stephen Fry, Clare Balding, Simon Pegg and Lord Alan Sugar.

The news of the release was revealed by MP Nigel Evans who read a statement outside the Moroccan Embassy in London.

It said: 'We are sympathetic to the distress felt by the family of Mr Cole following his arrest and detention and every effort has been made to address their concerns.

'Moroccan and British authorities are working closely together to resolve the case as rapidly as possible in a manner that is respectful of the norms and customs both our countries.

'Mr Cole has exercised his right of appeal and is due to appear in front of the judge of the court of appeals tomorrow morning.

'In the meantime Mr Cole is to be granted conditional release from prison today.'

Following the development, Mr Evans said: 'I'm really delighted that Mr Cole will not be spending another night on the floor of a prison cell in Marrakech.

'With a bit of luck common sense will kick in and we can get him home as quickly as possible.'

A statement released by the family read: 'We are delighted to announce that our father, Ray Cole, has been released from prison and is now boarding a flight from Marrakech.

'We would like to thank everyone here and in Morocco who has helped our campaign to secure the release of our wonderful father And we would like to thank the Moroccan authorities for showing clemency and compassion.'

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of reports that Mr Cole has been released.

'We have offered full consular support throughout his case and continue to do so. We remain in close contact with his family.'
