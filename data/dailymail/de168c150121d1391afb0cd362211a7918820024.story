More than 2,000 people have signed a petition calling for the arrest and prosecution of a group of teens who were caught on video viciously beating another teen after a baseball game in South LA.

The boys were all leaving Valencia High School after the game last week when they allegedly attacked the boy, who is seen in the video wearing a gray T-shirt.

The boys father has also spoken out to demand police action claiming 'I am now in fear of my son's safety every day that he goes to school.'

Speaking to ABC 7, the boy's father, who did not want to be identified, said that the attack began late in the evening on Friday.

'My son was innocent of anything,' he said to ABC 7, unwilling to comment on why the boys attacked his son.

The father has claimed he knows who the guilty teens are and voiced his anger that no one has been punished yet, even by the school.

'They are in the school, there's a video and for them to not know who these kids are? Wow,' the father said.

The school district spokeswoman, Gail Pinsker, said that Valencia High did not know yet who the perpetrators were.

'It's a very disturbing image. The district is very concerned,' said Pinsker. 'Disciplinary action will be taken with any students that are found to be in violation of rules.'

The attack happened after a baseball match between Valencia and Saugus High Schools.

Students set up the petition after they said they felt the school was dragging its heels in punishing those responsible. The boy was not seriously injured during the incident.

'It’s an active investigation that we have been working on for a few days. The school resource deputies are aware of the situation and the investigation is ongoing,' said LA County Sheriff Deputy Josh Dubin.
