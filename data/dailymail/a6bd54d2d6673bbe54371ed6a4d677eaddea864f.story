Danny Wilson can be found burrowing happily around the corridors of a stand built with the proceeds of Barnsley’s single season with the high rollers in the Premier League.

The previous evening had been spent in Kidderminster watching Scunthorpe beat Worcester in an epic FA Cup penalty shootout.

The morning had been spent in the squall on the training pitches, beside the academy, behind Oakwell’s North Stand, all funded as part of the £4.5million development which transformed one end of the ground and provides a legacy from one year in the top tier.

It was Wilson who led Barnsley to promotion in 1996-97 to the soundtrack of delirious supporters who sang: ‘It’s just like watching Brazil.’

It was his first managerial role and much has happened since but it feels like the perfect place to celebrate 1,000 games as a boss.

‘Coming here from Sheffield Wednesday (where he played), I wasn’t embraced by everybody,’ he recalled. ‘There were tough times. We were struggling financially. They had to close three sides of the ground to put in seats and crowds were down to four or five thousand at times.

‘We were 1-0 down at Bromsgrove in an FA Cup-tie with a few minutes to go and defending a corner in front of our own fans and they’re venting their frustration at me.

‘They were chipping bits of stone off the top of a wall and pelting me with it. Then we broke from that corner and equalised. Within a minute, Owen Archdeacon got the winner.’

By the time he returned to Barnsley for a second spell, this time last year, Wilson had adapted to the wild oscillations of managerial life.

He went from being stoned to being feted and then hated again when he left to take over back at Wednesday. And so the wheel of fortune turns. ‘You need a mental toughness,’ he said. ‘You need to be resilient. If you’re up and down on every decision or opinion, you won’t last.

‘People say, “Oh, nice guy Wilson”, but they wouldn’t say that if things were going wrong and I was in their faces in the week. You have to have that ruthlessness. That’s what keeps you going.

‘My ambition has never diminished. I still believe I can coach in the Premier League. I’ve always believed that. I want to be at the top. But opportunities up there are rare for British coaches from the lower leagues. Maybe we’re just not sexy enough. That must be it, because we have the ability and the knowledge. It’s one thing I’d like to see change.

‘The way I feel at the moment, I could carry on for the next 10 years. I’m 55 in January. I feel fit as anything but that decision is always in other people’s hands, isn’t it?’

More than a steely determination, disguised by a friendly nature, he dedicates his landmark to the support of his wife Karen and children Laurie and Carrie through a career spanning 37 years since joining Bury as a teenager from Wigan, then a non-League club.

He has worked almost without interruption through the opinion boom, when managers pray for a year in the job and chairmen are pressurised by vocal minorities on radio phone-ins and social media.

‘We must have lived in 16 different houses in all corners of the country but Karen has never complained. Without that I’d have thought twice,’ said Wilson.

‘You need support, not only from your family but also those you work with. When you are asked for influences, you are expected to pick out a well-known manager who took you under his wing, but I’ve been influenced more by those who have always been close to listen or offer advice. They know who they are.’

As a player he skipped through nine clubs, winning the League Cup twice and 24 caps for Northern Ireland. In that time some big names left a mark. ‘There is one thing I’ve always remembered,’ said Wilson. ‘When I played for Ron Atkinson, he’d say, “When I sit in that stand I want to be entertained. I don’t want to go home after 90 minutes thinking, what was the hell was that?”

‘We’re entertainers. That’s our duty and that’s what we try to do.

‘We want to win — if you don’t it will cost you your job — but if you’re grinding one-nils out every week and you’re s***e, that doesn’t give me any satisfaction. There has to be enjoyment for the fans.’

He recalled the ‘fantastic enthusiasm’ of Chris Cattlin, his manager at Brighton, and few people work with Brian Clough without taking something from the experience.

This is the LMA’s official 1,000 Club list: 

Len Ashurst, Ron Atkinson, Dave Bassett, Alan Buckley, Sir Matt Busby, Brian Clough, Steve Coppell, Sir Alex Ferguson, Dario Gradi, Roy Hodgson, Brian Horton, Lennie Lawrence, Lawrie McMenemy, Harry Redknapp, Sir Bobby Robson, Joe Royle, Denis Smith, Jim Smith, Alec Stock, Graham Taylor, Graham Turner, Neil Warnock, Arsene Wenger. 

Wilson, who joined Nottingham Forest for £150,000 in 1983, said: ‘Chesterfield were desperate for £70,000, so Cloughie asked on the quiet if any of the excess money would go on the team. When he found out it wouldn’t, he threw a couple of players into the deal: Calvin Plummer and Steve Kendal. That’s how he was.

‘I had only a short spell with him but I’m very proud that he thought I could contribute to his team. He was fascinating. I couldn’t take my eyes off him. When he spoke, you listened to every word and took it on board. “Hello, well done”, and that was me sky-high for a week.

‘You want to be successful, of course. There have been times when I’ve won promotions and it’s great to find players and see them develop like Charlie Austin (QPR striker signed by Wilson at Swindon) but that’s not always what comes to mind when you reflect. It’s your connections with different clubs and their fans, and people you meet and work with.

‘There’s not one club I regret going to. MK Dons were playing in the hockey stadium and it was the worst ground I’ve ever been to. There was no atmosphere, hardly any fans, but Pete Winkelman’s dream was there. No money, just a dream.

‘Irrespective of whether you think it’s right or wrong, it’s one of the best things that’s happened to Milton Keynes.’

Wilson’s return to Barnsley was met with mixed feelings. He was unable to prevent relegation in May and consistency has eluded them as they approach Saturday's League One fixture against Leyton Orient.

‘You can’t always go out in the public domain and say, “If we finish fifth bottom we’ll be all right”,’ he said. ‘What does that give the fans to look forward to? You have to be as bullish as you can but realistically, in the next two or three years, we’d like to be in the Championship again.

‘Whether I’m part of it, I don’t know. I’d never look that far forward. Are they capable of doing it? Yes, but maybe not this season, although this league is tight.

‘If we get there, can we sustain it and stay up? Yes, I think we would because we have an owner who would back us, but everything is more realistic at this club than it has been.’
