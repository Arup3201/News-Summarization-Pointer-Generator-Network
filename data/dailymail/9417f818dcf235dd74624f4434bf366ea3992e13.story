A man who was hit by an alleged drunk driver has miraculously survived.

The incident took place in the city of Amol, in Iran.

The pedestrian, who has not been named, had been returning to his car outside a supermarket at 2am.

Just seconds later, as he is preparing to open his vehicle, another driver ploughs into the back of him at high speed.

The man was catapulted six-feet backwards and was thrown across the pavement, with the oncoming car appearing to miss him by inches.

Amazingly, the man was not killed, and is reported to be in a stable condition. The only injuries he sustained were said to be three fractured bones, in his arm, leg and back.

The footage was captured by the supermarket’s CCTV camera, and was released by the shop’s owner, Hashem Bena.

Mr Bena decided to release the video in a bid to warn people about the dangers of drink driving, and ‘how easily it can be to destroy the lives of innocent people in mere seconds’.
