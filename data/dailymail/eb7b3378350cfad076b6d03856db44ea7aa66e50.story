Support: JK Rowling, pictured with her husband Dr Neil Murray, has taken to Twitter to vent her frustrations at the SNP leader

JK Rowling has accused Alex Salmond of ‘scaremongering’ over the threat to the NHS in Scotland if it stays in the UK.

The English-born writer, who has lived in Edinburgh for many years, took to Twitter to vent her frustration at a series of claims from the SNP ahead of this month’s independence referendum.

Mr Salmond has claimed the health service can only be protected from ‘privatisation’ in an independent Scotland, even though policy is already fully devolved to Edinburgh.

Miss Rowling is married to Dr Neil Murray, a former hospital doctor in Edinburgh who is now a GP, and has donated millions of pounds to tackling multiple sclerosis and other neurological diseases.

In June she was subjected to a torrent of online abuse by Scottish nationalists after giving £1million to the No campaign.

Yesterday, the Harry Potter author directed her 3.6million Twitter followers to a ‘fact check’ by Channel 4, which concludes: ‘NHS England can use more private providers, introduce more charges or stand on its head, but there is no pressure on Scotland to follow suit and no reason why health funding to Scotland will be affected.’

Challenged by photographer Alan McCredie on Twitter, the author later replied: ‘I fund medical research in Scotland (MS). I’m also married to a Scottish GP who deplores scaremongering on the NHS.’

Scottish Labour MSP Jackie Baillie said: ‘JK Rowling is absolutely right. The nationalists are trying to scare people on the NHS. They should stop it now.’

But Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon denied scaremongering, saying an independent Scotland would help to ‘protect our public services like the NHS’.

Meanwhile, Gordon Brown yesterday pledged to lead the negotiations to win new powers for Scotland following a No vote in the referendum. The former prime minister insisted a vote to keep the Union ‘does not mean no change’. At a Labour event in Westminster, Mr Brown revealed he has written to Commons Speaker John Bercow demanding a full debate when parliament returns in October to thrash out the extra powers that will be handed to Holyrood if full independence is rejected.

Labour, the Tories and the Lib Dems are agreed further devolution should follow a No vote, but have set out different visions of what should be included.

Mr Brown, who is believed to have agreed his plan with Ed Miliband, said the other two parties would have to ‘accept our proposals’, as the Tories have almost no representation north of the border and the Lib Dems are languishing in sixth place in the polls.

He said this would involve Scotland being given new tax-raising powers and control over some benefits, including housing benefit. But he said there would be no change in the funding formula, which English MPs complain leads to Scotland being subsidised by English taxpayers.

Mr Brown said Scotland receives £1billion more from the NHS than it would if funding was provided on a strict per-head basis.

He also launched an assault on Mr Salmond, particularly over his suggestion that an independent Scotland could continue to use the pound even if Westminster rejects a full currency union.

He said this would leave Scotland in a ‘colonial relationship’ with the rest of the UK, as interest rates would be set in London without any regard for the needs of the Scottish economy.
