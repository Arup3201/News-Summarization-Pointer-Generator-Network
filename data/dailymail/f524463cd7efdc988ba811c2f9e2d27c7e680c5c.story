'They called and told us that my baby is still at the funeral home,' Miss Mercedez told ABC13.

The couple said they were told that the baby which had been buried belonged was not their son and that their own child was still in the morgue.

'We were 
crying for our baby. And we didn't even know. We thought that our baby 
was the baby that was supposed to be in the casket,'Â  said Uscanga.

The distraught couple made arrangements for another
funeral home to pick up their baby yesterday afternoon.

Grandfather George Uscanga saidL 'I'm speechless. I'm speechless.'

They are now planning to ask for an investigation into the distressing mix-up and are in contact with an attorney.

Brookside Memorial Park told ABC13, they were working closely with the families to resolve the situation.

Respect: Relatives and friends at the funeral

'Out of respect for the privacy of the families, it 
would be inappropriate to release any details.

The company added: 'We have 
policies and procedures in place, however occasionally mistakes happen. 
In those instances, we maintain full disclosure with the families.'
