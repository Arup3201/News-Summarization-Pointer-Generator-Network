A married mom accused of helping her white supremacist husband dump their teenage babysitter's body in the woods after a night of sex and drugs led to the girl's overdose death, has been sentenced today to up to five years in jail.

Dea Millerberg, 41, was sentenced on Thursday in Ogden, Utah after she pleaded guilty in June to three felonies, including desecration of a human body.

She agreed to a plea deal after testifying against her husband, 38-year-old Eric Millerberg over the murder of 16-year-old Alexis Rasmussen. 

Millerberg, a mother of two young daughters, sobbed hysterically in court on Thursday and turned to apologize to Miss Rasmussen's mother, Dawn Miera, who had come to watch her be sent to jail.

Millerberg, 41, arrives at 2nd District Court on Thursday in Ogden, Utah. Millerberg was given five years for helping dispose of their teen babysitter's body with her husband 

Millerberg and her husband had a drug-fueled, salacious sexual relationship with the teenager that led to her death from an overdose in 2011.

Her husband, 38-year-old Eric Millerberg, is serving up to life in prison after he was found guilty of child abuse homicide and other charges.

Mrs Millerberg also pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and obtaining a prescription illegally in June. 

Alexis Rasmussen, 16, reportedly asked the Millerbergs how to get meth and they started smoking the drug, along with heroin and marijuana, with the girl. When she overdosed, they dumped her body in the woods

Dawn Miera, mother of Alexis Rasmussen, speaks with reporters after a state judge sentenced 41-year-old Dea Millerberg on Thursday for helping dump her daughter's body after a drug overdose 

Weber County Attorney Dee Smith said during in June that he considered the plea bargain was a fair deal considering that Millerberg helped prosecutors get her husband convicted.

During a three-day trial in February, prosecutors brought detectives, medical examiners, prisoners and Dea Millerberg to the stand to show that Eric Millerberg recklessly injected Rasmussen with lethal doses of heroin and methamphetamine during a night of sex and drugs.

Rasmussen had seven times the lethal amount of methamphetamine in her system and high levels of morphine and amphetamines, and that likely caused her death, a medical examiner said. 

Prosecutors told jurors that Eric Millerberg and his wife then dumped Rasmussen's body in the woods of northern Utah while lying to police as the girl's mother desperately searched for her for more than a month.

Eric Millerberg was sentenced to life in March for child abuse homicide - a first-degree felony and one to 15 years for obstructing justice, a second-degree felony.

Millerberg appeared in disbelief today when she was sentenced. She broken down in court and apologized to the teenager's mother 

He was also sentenced to two terms of zero to five years for the unlawful and statutory rape of a 16-or-17-year-old - and abuse or desecration of a human body, third-degree felonies.

The sentences are consecutive.

On his part, Millerberg, 38, showed no sign of emotion as the judge sentenced him for killing Lexi Rasmussen, 16, by injecting her with a lethal dose of drugs in September of 2011.

Millerberg's wife Dea was also in the house at the same time getting high when Miss Rasmussen fell unconscious and died.

The two grabbed her body, stuffed it in to a trash bag, bundled it in the trunk of their car and dumped it in a remote rural location. Miss Rasmussen was found 38 days later.

Dea said the couple started using Alexis - or Lexi as she called her - as a babysitter for their two daughters in the spring of 2011.

They became friends and started drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana with the teen before Alexis began requesting that they try harder drugs like methamphetamine and heroin. Eventually they began paying Alexis with meth.

According to Salt Lake Tribune, Dea testified that on the night of the girl's death, she had picked up Alexis to baby sit her kids.

She said as soon as Alexis arrived at the house, Eric Millerberg helped her get high by injecting her with drugs - once with heroin and twice with meth - into her arm and neck.

Then, when she was ‘as high as she had ever been’, the girl and Eric Millerberg performed oral sex on one another. Dea said that she was not involved in the encounter.  

A short while later, the drugs had a negative effect on the teen and she started ‘freaking out’. She reportedly felt disoriented and cold, so she asked if she could take a warm bath in the couple’s master bathroom.

After leaving her alone in the bath at her request, the Millerbergs checked on her about 45 minutes later to find that she was still cold, so Dea wrapped her in a blanket and told her to lie down in another bedroom.

The couple left her to smoke cigarettes, and returned about a half hour later to find her unresponsive.

‘She wasn't breathing. She had mucousy stuff coming out of the right side of her mouth,’ said Dea, who was a licensed nurse and tried to resuscitate the girl to no avail.

They then tried to figure out what to do next.  

‘It really was a panic. The idea of it was, we will lose our kids and go to jail, and there was nothing we could do to bring her back,’ she told the court.

Eric Millerberg was on parole at the time for burglary and firearm charges, and he was also known to be part of the Silent Aryan Warriors, a white supremacist prison gang.

The girl was found with her legs folded against her in a fetal position, her lower half stuffed into a garbage bag.

Utah assistant medical examiner Joseph White testified on Friday that the girl’s body was so badly decomposed, it was difficult to identify her. Dental records and a fingerprint analysis finally led to a positive identification.

A toxicologist testified that reports showed she had ingested meth at least 24 hours before her death. 

The couple- along with their toddler- drove around extensively disposing of Alexis' body and all evidence. She was found here in Morgan County six weeks after her death
