Andrew Silverman will stay at the Hamptons house alongside his estranged wife Lauren for the foreseeable future for the benefit of his young son, it can be revealed.

A family source said: 'Andrew's taking it day by day, he's pretty calm today.

'The whole thing is upsetting, but he's sucked it up and put his feelings aside so he can be with his son - that's his priority.

Priority: Andrew Silverman returns to his Bridgehampton home to spend time with his son

'They both decided to stay in the same house for Adam.'

The wealthy property developer is said to be 'not bothered' by many of the photos of his wife and Cowell getting close on vacation - mainly because he was with them at the time.

However, in the pictures published yesterday of the pair sharing what seems to be a kiss, the source said: 'It's upsetting.'

Despite his wife carrying Simon Cowell's child, Andrew returned to his $4 million Hamptons home on Thursday to 'preserve normality' for his seven-year-old son and stayed the night.

But according to reports, the 'crisis talks' with wife Lauren did not happen as the former couple decided not to discuss their impending divorce amid a frosty atmosphere.

With all parties reportedly wanting a divorce as soon as possible, the real estate mogul is said to be gunning for sole custody of their child, Adam.

Andrew was spotted leaving the couple's house at 9am on Friday after spending the night with his estranged wife and son.

But far from trying to build bridges, it seems that the former couple had 'minimal conversation' as the atmosphere was too frosty.

'Andrew stayed at the house to create some normalcy for their son,' a source told The New York Post.

'There was no talk about the divorce settlement. That is being handled by the lawyers. There was minimal conversation between them. It was done purely for their child.'

This comes amid reports that Andrew will be applying for sole custody of their son, as sources have told TMZ that his socialite wife reportedly disappears from the family home for long periods of time.

Mr Silverman reportedly visited the house on Thursday for talks with his wife over her affair with Cowell.

Looking stressed and tense, he told reporters: 'This is a very difficult time. Please keep your distance'.

On Friday morning, he sped off in a Mercedes sports car looking stony faced and 
wearing a cap and sunglasses.

A black Escalade with tinted windows 
had already emerged from the garage of the mansion and he followed it to
the end of the road and turned the other way.

The Escalade returned 10 minutes after it left and backed into the garage of the house. Andrew was seen driving at speed along country lanes.

Meanwhile, Simon's ex-fiancée Mezhgan Hussainy is reportedly furious after believing that he may have cheated on her with Lauren during their relationship.

She was spotting arriving at her former love's home on Thursday, suggesting that she wanted to discuss the situation with him.

Sources have told The Mirror that Mazhgan is 'horribly hurt' by the fact that Simon may have betrayed her.

But according to TMZ heartbroken Andrew is moving quickly to end the 10 year marriage, and wants  to settle custody and financial issues quickly.

He is reportedly asking for full custody of their son, but will negotiate on that point claim TMZ.

As Lauren and Andrew held crisis talks a member of her family spoke exclusively to MailOnline expressing support for the brunette and describing her unborn child as the only one 'not guilty of anything'.

Speaking from her home in Florida home, Rosa Davis, who is married to Lauren’s father Steven said: 'I speak with Lauren every day. She is doing fine but she has a lot to face, a lot of stuff to cope with and her pregnancy too.

'The main concern for her right now is her son, Adam, and her baby. This baby is not guilty of anything. Babies come into the world and all we can do is receive them with joy.'

She added: 'We are a very close family and we always support our kids through the good times and the bad times. You can ask anyone any of our friends.'

Mrs Davis would not respond when asked if the revelation of the affair, allegedly a longstanding one between Cowell and Lauren, was a surprise to the close family.

She said: 'All I can say is that Lauren is a good parent.'

On Thursday, Lauren was accused of being a 'gold digger' after allegedly issuing the music mogul with a string of outrageous demands, telling him she wants marriage and her own reality TV show before she will allow him access to the child.

But in spite of the socialite's alleged demands, MailOnline can reveal Cowell does not plan to marry her, even if they are serious about their relationship, with friends of the star revealing he's not planning on rushing down the aisle anytime soon.

A source told MailOnline: 'Simon and Lauren are in a relationship, they are very happy – she’s been good for him.

'This is not a situation where they are not together and Simon will just pay for their child. They are a couple. But, there are no marriage plans at the moment.'

According to TMZ, Simon still has plans to be a financial figure for the child.

'He will gladly provide for the child, and not just financially,' their source said.  'Simon is saying he will be a committed, fully-involved parent and says he wants a big role in raising the child.'

In divorce papers filed two weeks ago by her estranged spouse Andrew, Lauren was accused of being 'cruel and inhuman' towards her husband.

Despite the controversy surrounding her, Lauren looked in good spirits and smiled for the cameras as she made her first public appearance since news of the unplanned pregnancy broke on Wednesday morning.

In an official statement later that day, Lauren said: 'I am committed to sorting things out with Andrew as amicably as possible to ensure the well-being of our son. I would hope for some space and privacy in order to work through this.'

Her lawyers, Robert Cohen and Bernard Clair of Cohen Clair Lans Greifer & Thorpe LLP, added: 'We are working to resolve this situation in a fair and reasonable way that protects the best interests of our client and her son.'

MailOnline can reveal that Lauren and her estranged husband Andrew worked together to co-ordinate their statements, each emphasising that their seven-year-old son Adam was their joint priority.

Mr Silverman's stated: 'My top priority is protecting my seven-year-old son while working to resolve all outstanding issues with my wife. Hopefully people can respect the interest of our child during this process.'

However, Mr Silverman's brother, Alexander, said what had unfolded in the last few days was 'an unbelievable story of betrayal. It is a sad story and a tragic story'.
