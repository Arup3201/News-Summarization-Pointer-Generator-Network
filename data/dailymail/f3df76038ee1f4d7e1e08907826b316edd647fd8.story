A Utah teenager’s dress worn to a school dance over the weekend got the cold shoulder from administrators, who forced the girl to wear a winter coat to cover up her bare arms.

Gabi Finlayson, 15, a student at Lone Peak High School in Highland, showed up at the Preference Dance last Saturday wearing a delicate pink lace gown with a high neck and a full maxi skirt.

However, the teenager was found to be in violation of the school's strict dress code because her shoulders and arms were exposed.

She got the cold shoulder: Gabi Finlayson, 15, showed up to her school dance in this delicate dress inspired by Audrey Hepburn, only to be told by a school official to cover up her bare shoulders with a coat 

Speaking to the station KUTV, the high schooler said she was left feeling 'embarrassed' and ‘insulted’ when a school official approached her in the middle of the party and asked her to put on a shawl or a coat.

'I didn't want to make a big scene so I said, ‘yes.’ I had a coat in the car so I had to go back and get it,' said Gabi.

The young woman said she came away feeling angry and humiliated after being forced to wear a coat over her conservative dress for the entire duration of the party.

'Somehow my shoulders are sexualized,' Finlayson said. 'Like it's my responsibility to make sure the boys’ thoughts are not unclean.'

Finlayson said she could not have imagined that anyone at the school would find her Parisian dress, inspired by the late actress and fashion icon Audrey Hepburn, objectionable or overly revealing.

Restrictive: Lone Peak High School in Highland, Utah, has a very strict dress code prohibiting girls from wearing backless dresses, outfits with thin straps or cleavage

Dressed down: Gabi said she came away feeling humiliated after being body-shamed in public

Gabi argued that some of her schoolmates turned up at the event wearing outfits that were much shorter and tighter than hers, but they were not asked to cover up.

Besides Finlayson, three other students out of 1,200 were asked to cover up their shoulders on the night of the dance, according to Lone Peak high Principal Rhonda Bromley.

Wrong message: Gabi and her mother accused the school of sexualizing young girls and their bodies 

Miss Bromley insisted that all of the students are aware of the school's dress code for formal events, which prohibits teens from wearing backless dresses below the shoulder blades, outfits featuring straps narrower than 2inches or garments with a cleavage.

According to the rules, revealing formal wear must be covered with a shawl, a shrug or a bolero 'at all times.'

Gabi's mother, Kristy Maxfield Kimball, has come out in support of her daughter accusing the school of sexualizing young girls and sending them a negative message that they should be ashamed of their bodies.

‘How have we gotten to the point that we look at shoulders as if they're somehow pornographic?’ Kimball said.

On her Facebook page, Mrs Kimball speculated whether the school administration simply wants girls to dress in accordance with Mormon values.

'Girls [sic] bodies are not sexual objects and religious perspectives should not be imposed at a public school. Shoulders are not sexual!!!' Gabi's mother fumed.

Principal Bromley countered by insisting that Lone Peak's policies regarding formal wear have been accepted by the entire school community, and that the person who was tasked with enforcing the dress code at the dance did so in a 'careful and sensitive way.'

On her part, Gabi suggested that instead of forcing girls to cover up their bodies, we as a society should teach boys not to treat them as sex objects created for their pleasure.
