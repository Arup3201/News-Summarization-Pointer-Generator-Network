A six-bedroom mansion in one of the most desirable postcodes in London has gone on the market for £75million - but any buyer will need another £25million to renovate it before they can move in.

Number 2 Carlton House Terrace is just a few minutes stroll from Buckingham Palace and overlooks The Mall and St James's Park.

Built in 1829, it has hosted Kings and Queens and has been called home by aristocrats, powerful American business leaders and even Sir James Horlick, of malted drink fame.

Exceedingly desirable residence: No2 Carlton House Terrace, a short stroll from Buckingham Palace, is on the market for £75million

Lick of paint: The interior will need an extensive revamp, estimated to cost in the region of £25m

Plush: This staircase is one of the few remaining original features. It was heavily damaged by bombing in the Second World War

It was designed by John Nash, the architect responsible for much of the layout of Regency London under the patronage of the Prince Regent and the man behind the Royal Pavilion, Brighton, as well as Buckingham Palace itself.

Other previous residents of the terrace include prime Ministers Palmerston and Gladstone, as well as Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India.

A less salubrious resident was Joachim von Ribbentrop, the former Ambassador from Nazi Germany.

In the 20th century the Terrace came under threat of partial or complete demolition and redevelopment because there was little demand for large houses in the centre of the capital. Many of the properties were leased to exclusive clubs.

Surprisingly, considering its location, the property lay empty for for twenty years after it was severely damaged by bombing in 1940.

Famous guests at the property have included King George V and Queen Mary

Elaborate: Detailed period stonework on the side of the building.

Former resident: The Duke of Roxburghe (left), calling at Buckingham Palace after the death of King Edward VII. He lived in the property in the 1920s and 1930s. Right, The Duke of York's Column in the 19th century. The house can be seen to the left

There has already been interest in the property from the global super-rich

Currently, the 23,135 sq ft property is currently the home of the Royal College of Pathologists, but they have now outgrown the building and so the Crown Estate is looking to sell via estate agents Savills, reports The Times.

One of the appealing aspects of the property is the buyer can enjoy the beautiful period facade but choose either a modern or more sympathetic interior when renovating.

Interest from overseas buyers is said to be high, especially because of the property's proximity to Buckingham Palace.

The architect behind the planning application has proposed large reception rooms, a library, a swimming pool, a cinema room, and a roof terrace with views across the city.

The construction of Carlton House Terrace was begun by John Nash in 1829. It consisted of two terraces, both facing St James’s Park.

Number 2 was the first house to be completed. The terraces were designed in a neoclassical style, stucco clad, with Corinthian columned facades, surmounted by an elaborate frieze and pediment.

The houses were unusual among expensive London terraces in having no mews to the rear. This was because Nash wanted the houses to make the best possible use of the view of the park.

From its inception, the scale and location of Carlton House Terrace made it an ideal townhouse for the aristocracy.

Former residents have included The Marquess of Clanricarde, George Savile Foljambe and his wife Viscountess Milton, Madlwin Drummond, the widow of American business leader Marshall Field, New York millionaire Otto Khan, the Duke and Duchess of Roxburghe and Sir James Horlick.

In 1940 it was hit by a bomb and lay empty for 20 years. In 1967 it was acquired by the Royal College of Pathologists.
