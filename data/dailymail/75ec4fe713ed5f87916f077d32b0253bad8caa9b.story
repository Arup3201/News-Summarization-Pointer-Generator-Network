British Airways is following its budget rivals by charging passengers to check in their baggage on short-haul flights.

The airline announced a £10 fee to put luggage in the hold on some of its routes from Heathrow and London City.

It will come into effect later this month on flights to Amsterdam, Barcelona, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Paris, Rome, Rotterdam and Stockholm.

Budget: British Airways passengers will soon be able to fly from London Heathrow and City airports on a 'no-frills' hand-luggage only ticket

BA said it is making short-haul 
flights cheaper for those who do not want to fly with hold luggage, but 
denied that it had been forced to change its fares structure to compete 
with budget airlines.

‘We are basically offering the fare to adapt to travellers’ requirements and to give them what they want,’ said a spokesman.

The charge follows a trial over the summer on short-haul routes from Gatwick, where BA faces strong competition from easyJet.

Many
airlines now impose add-on charges for services including baggage, 
food, seat reservations, priority boarding, fast-track security or seats
with more legroom.

These now comprise up to 5 per cent of airlines’ 
total income, compared with less than 1 per cent five years ago.

Saving time and money: Not only will passengers save themselves £10, but they might also avoid the queue to check larger items of luggage into the hold

Robin
Glover-Faure, BA head of short haul, said: ‘The hand-baggage-only fare 
at Gatwick has proved popular with customers, so we’re now introducing 
it on a selected number of short-haul routes from Heathrow and London 
City.

‘If it proves as successful, we plan to roll it out across the whole short-haul network in the coming months.’

EasyJet charges between £9 and £19 for bags checked into the hold. Bags weighing more than 20kg cost customers flying with Ryanair £25.

But
beware. If they do chose to take a bag to be checked in at the airport 
after having booked a hand-luggage only ticket, passengers will pay an 
additional £40 to stow their case.

Competition: The move will see BA rival cheaper alternative carriers such as easyJet

The move will not affect long-haul flights, where BA faces strong competition from airlines offering larger baggage allowances.

Aviation consultant John Strickland said BA needs to show that its no-baggage fares are competitive with low-cost carriers.

Ironically, Luton-based easyJet appeared to move in the opposite direction to BA last week by launching an 'inclusive fare' that includes seat assignment and a checked in bag in the price.
