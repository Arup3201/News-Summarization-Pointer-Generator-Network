Six-time Olympic gold medalist Amy Van Dyken Rouen has assured fans she is doing well after severing her spine in an ATV accident by posting several pictures showing her smiling in her hospital bed.

'Hello everyone,' the 41-year-old wrote alongside an image of her waving. 'I cannot express how much your love and support are helping me. #blessyouall #OneDayAtATime.'

Despite her positivity, her husband, former Denver Broncos punter Tom Rouen, said the family doesn't yet know if she'll be paralyzed for life.

'We're not sure yet,' Rouen told the Denver Post. 'We're going to take it day by day. Whatever challenges come up, we'll meet them and address.'

Staying positive: Amy Van Dyken Rouen has been updating fans with her progress since she severed her spine in an ATV accident last week. She shared this photo from her hospital room on Wednesday

Upbeat: In a photograph on Friday, she wrote: 'Happy Friday! No more surgeries for this girl, so I celebrate with Froot Loops... SHHH, don't tell! #GettingStronger'

Rouen, who has been in hospital in Scottsdale, Arizona since hitting a curb as she drove an ATV back from dinner on Friday - throwing her down an embankment - has been upbeat throughout her early treatment.

This week she even joked that being in a wheelchair means she'll get the best seats when she watches her favorite baseball team, the Arizona Diamondbacks.

'Just thinking out loud,' she wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. 'Now I will get 
really good seats at @dbacks and other favorite sports teams. #awesome 
#bringMyOwnChair #goodParking2.'

On Thursday morning, she added: 'Was in MRI until 4:00am today (started at 11:30pm) did whole spine and brain, and so far, so good. Yes, I have a brain! LOL #BabySteps.'

Smiling: Another image shared on Instagram shows her smiling with a gift and balloons sent by her sister's colleagues on Wednesday. 'Starting to look like the movie 'Up' in here,' she quipped

Having a laugh: In another image on Friday, she said she had received gifts from store Mirth in a Box

Support: She grins with friends from her book club during their visit to the hospital this week

She has also posted an image of the gifts she had received and a photo of members of her book club who visited her in hospital. Another picture shows her dog, Kuma, in her hospital room.

At some point early next week, she will be flown by Angel MedFlight to Craig Hospital in Englewood, Colorado to start rehabilitation on her spine.

'She's looking forward to coming home and going to Craig Hospital and being near her family and friends in Colorado,' her husband said. 'She's looking forward to being back in that Mile High air. She's going to tackle this like everything else she does in her life.'

Speaking to the Denver Post, Rouen said the main injury was high on her back but that she had other injuries the doctors couldn't deal with initially.

The couple were driving back from dinner in Show Low, Arizona on Friday when Van Dyken's ATV hit a curb and threw her down an embankment, breaking a vertebrae and severing her spine.

Joy: She laughs at a giant Hello Kitty balloon sent to her on Thursday by former pitcher Ron Dibble

Reunited: On Thursday, Van Dyken, who has been in hospital since Friday, got a visit from her dog, Kuma

Still smiling: In another photograph on Tuesday, hospital staff help her sit for the first time since the accident

Rouen, who 
was on a motorbike, raced to reach her and lifted her head to help her 
breathe. He kept her stable until the helicopter 
arrived, he revealed in a letter than he released with her family.

By her side: Her husband Tom Rouen, pictured, said he does not yet know if she will walk again

A witness, who ran to her as she lay beside the ATV, said she was not wearing a helmet.

When help arrived, Van Dyken, 46, said she could not feel her legs and was airlifted to the intensive care unit at Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn Medical Center.

'Amy 
awoke within hours of surgery acting like her typical spunky, 
boisterous, ebullient self and has spent the last 24 hours entertaining 
her family and her medical staff in the ICU,' her husband said in a letter shared with Swimming World Magazine a couple of days after the injury.

'She has made at least one 
male nurse blush. Amy's attitude has been overwhelmingly positive and 
optimistic. She has been far more of a comfort to us than we have been 
to her.'

The retired 
athlete's family said she had severed her spinal cord and that her broken 
vertebrae came within millimeters of rupturing her aorta.

Their letter continued: 'Amy has a long, trying road ahead of her, but as anyone 
who knows her can attest, her unparalleled mental strength and 
determination will propel her. She is a fighter.

'Amy has overcome 
seemingly insurmountable obstacles before, winning 6 Olympic gold medals
 and becoming one of the greatest female athletes of her generation 
despite battling lifelong chronic asthma.

'Now this is her new challenge,
 her new battle. With the unconditional love and support of her friends,
 family and fans, Amy welcomes the challenges she will face as she opens
 this new chapter of her life.'

The couple is receiving a lot of support from family, friends and fans, Rouen told the Denver Post.

'It's rough,' he said. 'But Amy is aware of the challenges ahead of her. She is ready to meet them head-on.'

He told police officers that he had changed the throttle mechanism on the ATV from a thumb accelerator to a twist accelerator a few days before the accident - but he wasn't sure if it was a factor in the accident. He added that his wife had not been drinking alcohol during their dinner that evening.

In a statement to Swimming World Magazine, USA Swimming said they were 'devastated' to hear about her accident.

'We're happy to hear that she escaped and is now in great care,' the statement continued. 'That she is already 'acting like her typical spunky, boisterous, ebullient self' shows she's on a great path.

Champion: Van Dyken became the first U.S. woman to win four golds at one Olympics

'Amy is a 
champion who has proven throughout her life that she is a fighter who 
takes on challenges and comes out on top. We know Amy will tackle her 
rehabilitation with vigor and be back on her feet sooner rather than 
later.'

Van Dyken had taken 
up swimming to help relieve her asthma, swimming for the University of 
Arizona for two years before transferring to her home town to attend 
Colorado State.

She
 went on to become the first U.S. woman to win four golds at one 
Olympics, which she which she accomplished in 1996 by picking up gold in
 the 100 meter butterfly, 50 meter freestyle and the 4x100 meter 
freestyle and 4x100 meter medley relays.

She won two more Olympic relay golds in 2000 and was inducted into the U.S. Olympic Committee Hall of Fame in 2008.

She
 has lived in Arizona in recent years, working in local radio and later 
nationally for Fox Sports Radio. She married Rouen in 2001.
