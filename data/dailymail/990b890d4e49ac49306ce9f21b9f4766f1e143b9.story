A teacher’s aide has been charged with four counts of sexual assault after admitting a physical relationship with a 17-year-old student, telling police he was her ‘soul mate’.

Laura Bates, 44, said she had sex with the boy, a special education student at a Wisconsin high school, several times since the beginning of November.

The relationship was discovered after Bates told a relative that she could not live without the teenager and school district administrators were informed.

According to police, the relationship had been developing for more than a year and turned physical early last month as it was ‘too late’ to stop it, Bates had told the relative. 

‘This particular student and her had become quite close over about the last year, or so,’ said Lt. Mark Wiegert of the Calumet County Sheriff's Department told Fox 11.

Lt. Wiegert added that there is no reason to believe there are other victims.

Bates, of Hilbert, has appeared in court today charged with four felony counts of sexual assault of a student by school staff.

The married mother-of-three was arrested on Monday after the relationship came to light, and resigned from her job at Appleton West High School, Appleton.

Police in the teenager’s home town of 
Kaukauna are investigating multiple alleged incidents said to have taken
place between the teacher’s aide and the 17-year-old at his home.

Allinger said the Appleton Area School District accepted Bates’ resignation when it was offered Monday.

‘I
think as a district we’re extremely disappointed. It’s not something we
have to deal with a lot, obviously, and it’s shocking,’ Appleton West 
High superintendent Lee Allinger told Green Bay Press Gazette.

‘You just don’t think that this type of thing is going to happen with our students.’

Additional charges could be filed against Bates later this week.
