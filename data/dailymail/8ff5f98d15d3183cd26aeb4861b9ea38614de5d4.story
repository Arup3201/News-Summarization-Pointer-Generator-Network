The vice principal of a Toronto secondary school has been investigated after turning up at school dressed as Mr T in blackface make-up for Halloween last week.

As pictures of Mayfield Secondary School's Lionel Klotz surfaced on social media, the Peel School District board was inundated with complaints about the incident.

The vice principal was asked to stay home while the school board investigated.

'I would like to apologize on behalf of the Peel District School Board and senior administration for the hurt caused by this incident,' education director Tony Pontes said in a statement on Monday.

'Our board does not condone or tolerate actions of this type.'

Klotz dressed up as 1980s TV character Mr T, complete with gold chains, mohawk - and brown facepaint.

Pity the fool: Lionel Klotz's Halloween costume has caused a furor

'When I saw the picture it rubbed me the wrong way,' Peel resident Rad Dockery, who posted the photo on Twitter, told the Globe and Mail.

'I donâ€™t see it as malicious, but I do see it as insensitive.'

Despite the condemnation, Mayfield 
students stood by their vice-principal, creating an online petition 
called SaveKlotz2013 with 804 signatures. Another petition garnered 550 
signatures from students.

Board spokesperson Ryan
 Reyes told CityNews the board completed its investigation Tuesday 
evening but would not disclose what, if any, action would be taken 
because it is 'a personnel matter.'

Pontes said in a letter sent home with students on Wednesday that 'appropriate action' had been taken.

Twitter
 user Natalie Rea wrote Tuesday, 'RT this if you think @PeelSchools' VP 
Lionel Klotz's suspension is going too far. An error in judgment, yes. 
An infraction, no.'

It's
 unclear if Rea refers to Klotz's leave of absence while the board 
investigated the issue, or if the action the board has taken is to 
suspend Klotz.

A commentator on 680 News appears to confirm Klotz has been removed from his position.

'Yep, Mr Pontes removed Mr Klotz from Mayfield, so the kids their are denied an excellent VP because of discrimination,' wrote 'Jules.'

Halloween may be over but in the social media age, poor taste costumes will continue to haunt.

2013 was a bumper year for inappropriate costume choices that saw even celebrities getting it very wrong.

Poor taste: These two Floridians thought Halloween costumes depicting the recent Trayvon Martin tragedy, complete with blackface, would be funny

Two Florida men dressed as George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin, complete with bullet wound and blackface, football coaches in San Diego blackened their faces as members of the Jamaican bobsled team, and even actress Julianne Hough, who dressed as the character 'Crazy Eyes' from Orange is the New Black, felt the need to darken her face. 'Blackface, a practice whereby a white actor painted his face black before mocking African slaves and their descendants, is a formula ingrained in the history of North America,' writes Rachel Decoste in Huffington Post.'Blackface minstrelsy was a lucrative and easy form of entertainment for whites from the 1800s onwards. Caricaturing African-American patois, song, and dance created and reinforced racist stereotypes in an era where Blacks were considered subhuman.'

Meanwhile, Mayfield students all had their own take on the matter.

'So mr.klotz can paint his face green to be Shrek but he can't paint it to be Mr.T? Ridiculous... #SaveKlotz2013,' wrote Twitter user 'ChiefKeeif.'

'White people think you HAVE to have blackface to dress up like a character because all they see is black, not humanity. #SaveKlotz2013,' wrote 'blackalaureate.'
