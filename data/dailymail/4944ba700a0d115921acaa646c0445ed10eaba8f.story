British beauties hoping to set sail to the Miss World final in Indonesia have arrived in Torquay, Devon, to compete for the coveted Miss England crown.

Sixty beauty queens from across the country are vying for the title in a four day contest where they will have to participate in various rounds including the eco-fashion round - where contestants have to make their own green outfit - and the evening gown round.

The models were still given the opportunity to show off their figures today as they hit the beach and posed on a yacht in the English Riviera to promote the competition.

The final will be held in Torquay this year as it is the home of last year's winner, Charlotte Holmes.

She joined the pretenders to her crown at the beach today where the finalists took part in a Baywatch-style shoot running along the sea front in red and white swimwear.

She has relished her year as the reigning title-holder as the role has given her the opportunity to travel the world as an ambassador for a number of charities.

She also travelled to the Miss World final to represent England - as will this year's winner who will have the chance to take part in the beauty pageant in Indonesia.

But Charlotte warned the Miss England wannabes that there's more to the role than just 'parading around in swimwear or a glamorous gown.'

She said earlier this year when the hunt for the 2013 finalists was launched: 'The contestants, who range in both height and dress size, are required to take part in a series of enduring challenges during the four day final, aimed at testing and developing their physical fitness, mental creativity, styling, interview skills, individual talents, model potential and social skills.'

Those in the running for the Miss England title this year include Louise Bakewell, 19, from Somerset.

The glamorous competition is a far cry from her usual everyday life training in medicine along side working as a cattle farmer on her parents' farm and trainee mechanic.

Another hopeful is Jade Power, 19, from East Sussex who used to be bullied at school for being 'tall and ugly'.

The Miss England grand final will take place on 15th and 16th June at the Riviera International conference centre, Torquay. Tickets are available for both evenings. Visit www.missengland.info/the-finals for more information.
