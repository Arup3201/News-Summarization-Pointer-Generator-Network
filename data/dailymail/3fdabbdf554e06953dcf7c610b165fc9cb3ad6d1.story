A veteran Wisconsin middle school principal has been suspended after calling students 'idiots' and telling another student that he would 'kill' him for not following instructions, according to complaints filed against him.

Aaron Amundson, the administrator at Bluff View Intermediate School, was placed on one week of unpaid leave after admitting he lost his temper at students twice on December 23 and yelled at them.

In one incident, he told a student getting in line for buses: 'God help me if you have to ask me what line you’re in, I am going to kill ya,' according to the LaCrosse Tribune. 

Aaron Amundson, principal at Bluff View Intermediate School, was suspended for a week and has apologized publicly for his comments 

Mr Amundson, who has been with the school district for 17 years, told school administrators in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, that he didn't remember using the word kill, but admitted he lost his temper on that occasion.

Prairie du Chien School District administrator Drew Johnson also detailed an incident earlier in the day in which he called a group of students 'idiot's for not paying attention during a school assembly. 

He admitted to using the word 'idiot' and issued a written apology to the school.

'To those who are upset, I am disappointed with the words I used to address the students on 12/23/14. I made a mistake, and for that I sincerely apologize,' he said. 

Superintendent Johnson called the language that Mr Amundson used 'highly unacceptable.'

Mr Amundson has been in trouble before. He was given a letter of reprimand in 2013 for an 'inappropriate email' he sent to a staffer and also using inappropriate language when he began angry at a school employee, according the Tribune. 

 He was also investigated and disciplined twice by the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction for 'seclusion and restraint' issues.
