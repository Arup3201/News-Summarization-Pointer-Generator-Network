All 20 Premier League clubs have banded together for the first time to support the Tickets for Troops campaign which provides free match day passes to members of the Armed Forces.

Free tickets have been offered to some soldiers to all of the November 8 and 9 top flight fixtures to mark Remembrance Weekend.

Matches include Manchester United v Crystal Palace, Sunderland v Everton, Liverpool v Chelsea, Tottenham v Stoke and Swansea v Arsenal.

While Premier League clubs have backed the initiative since Tickets for Troops launched in 2009, this is the first time all jumped on board in support.

This year marks a particularly special landmark with the centenary of the First World War being  commemorated.

Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said: 'This is a very significant year in the history of our nation and football has had a prominent part in wartime, whether it was supporters and players volunteering to fight for their country or the famous football matches played in the trenches by soldiers from both sides during the Christmas Truce in 1914.'

Tickets For Troops forms part of the Premier League's Football Remembers celebrations, which also include an Under 12s Christmas Truce tournament in Ypres, a permanent memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum and other events bringing together football fans to honour the history of 1914. 

Chelsea captain John Terry is a longtime supporter of Tickets For Troops and commended all clubs for getting involved.

'At Chelsea we have been providing 50 tickets for every home game at the Bridge for five years and although it's a very simple gesture it goes some way to showing our admiration and respect for these incredibly brave men and women,' Terry said. 'These amazing people serve our country and give us the opportunity to live our lives the way we do today, they are true heroes.'

Lord Marland, Chairman of Tickets For Troops, was delighted to see all clubs joining the initiative in 'this very special year'. 

'Their generosity recognises the sacrifices and courage of all those men and women who work on our behalf and make us so proud,' Lord Marland said.

Premier League clubs will have combined to give away more than 5,000 tickets this season by the end of the weekend, about a quarter of the 20,000 Tickets For Troops given out since 2009.  

The charity has given out more than 600,000 tickets to its 140,000 registered members of the military to a range of sports.
