Leaked screenshots claim to show the next version of Google's Android software have leaked online - and it appears the firm has taken a leaf our of Apple's book.

The screenshots show newly redesigned icons with a 'flat' appearance - similar to Apple's iOS 7 redesign.

They icons far more closely resemble those used by Google on its websites.

Google's redesign will also make the Android logos look more like those used on the firm's web site

'The rumor, if you haven't guessed it already, is that Google will be changing the style of its launcher icons for Android apps to more closely resemble those of its web properties,' said Android Police, which released these shots.

'This new style, internally referred to as 'Moonshine' would see Android icons take on a somewhat flatter appearance.'

According to Android Police, the 4.5 update is known internally as Hera. 

It will further integrate Google's chrome browser into the Android software.

The search giant is expected to unveil the new software at its developer conference, I/O in San Francisco in June.

The 'flat' design was a cornerstone of Apple's recent overhaul of its iOS software, a project led by British designer Sir Jonathan Ive.

The radical overhaul of the iOS software was the result of a huge power struggle within the company, which saw the previous head of iOS, Scott Forstall, outed in favour of Sir Jonathan.

Forstall was Apple's senior vice president of iPhone Software, from 2007 - when the first iPhone launched - until last year when Apple announced he had resigned from his position.

Forstall launched the 'skeuomorphic' design of the iOS software, which uses visual cues that have been designed to look like physical objects, for example the 'leather' on the Find My Friends app, the 'wooden' bookshelves in iBooks and the green felt in the Game Center.

Now, it seems Google has taken the same decision.

Experts warned Apple's  radical makeover could confuse some users. Jan Dawson, chief telecoms analyst at Ovum, said it 'represents a massive overhaul of the look and feel of the operating system, which has remained largely unchanged visually since the original version.'

However, it has proved to be a huge success, with a record setting adoption rate among users.

The radical overhaul of the iOS software was the result of a huge power struggle within the company, which saw the previous head of iOS, Scott Forstall, outed in favour of Sir Jonathan Ive.

Forstall was Apple's senior vice president of iPhone Software, from 2007 - when the first iPhone launched - until last year when Apple announced he had resigned from his position. 

The iOS 7 design is the first major change to the operating system since he was replaced by London-born Jony (as he is known) Ive in October last year.

Ive was already in charge of industrial 
hardware designs for the iMac, iPhone and iPad and there were rumours 
that suggested that Forstall was forced to step down as software chief 
as part of Cook's apparent desire to remove anyone who had a good 
relationship with previous CEO Steve Jobs.

There were also rumours that Forstall and Ive couldn't be in a meeting together without Cook being there to mediate.

Forstall launched the 'skeuomorphic' design of the iOS software, which uses visual cues that have been designed to look like physical objects, for example the 'leather' on the Find My Friends app, the 'wooden' bookshelves in iBooks and the green felt in the Game Center.

It was a design that Ive is said to have disliked and other people had criticised Forstall for its dated look. In an interview with the Telegraph, Ive apparently 'winced' when the interviewer asked him about Forstall's designs and said he wanted to make iOS 7 more simple.

At last year’s WWDC 2011, Forstall introduced iOS 5 and later launched Siri on the iPhone 4S.

But by October 29, Apple announced in a press release that Forstall had resigned as senior vice president of iOS.

The announcement came after Apple's Q3 results showed revenues and profits grew less than predicted – the second quarter in a row the company had failed to meet expectations. 

Forstall had also been criticised after he launched Apple Maps due to them being inaccurate and in some cases, missing entire roads.

When Ive’s appointment was announced, it was clear the company was taking a new direction with the design of the iOS software. 

The statement said: 'Jony Ive will provide leadership and direction for Human Interface (HI) across the company in addition to his role as the leader of Industrial Design' in an official statement.

It continued: 'His incredible design aesthetic has been the driving force behind the look and feel of Apple’s products for more than a decade.'

Ive’s first design project was the iMac and this designed influenced the look of many other products such as the iPod and the iPhone.
