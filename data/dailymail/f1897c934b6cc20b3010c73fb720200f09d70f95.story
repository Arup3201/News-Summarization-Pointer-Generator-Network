In the end it was a cry for help. The great pity is that nobody within the England camp detected a problem until Raheem Sterling summoned the courage to speak to the head coach on Saturday morning.

'Boss, can I have a word?' was the first time Roy Hodgson became aware of an issue with the forward's condition, mental or physical, ahead of a Euro 2016 qualifier in Estonia the following day.

After the game, which England won 1-0, Hodgson spoke candidly about the exchange he had with Sterling at the team's London Colney training base.

Hodgson's decisiveness, moving Adam Lallana to the tip of the diamond, caught Sterling by surprise. He was asked to wear a bib: substitute.

Lallana's promotion can be traced to the players' bar at Wembley last Thursday, when Hodgson was raving about his second-half performance in the 5-0 thumping of San Marino. To those present it was clear that Hodgson wanted to re-align the team to accommodate him for the trip to Tallinn.

Lallana slows the game down, a Teddy Sheringham-type figure behind the main forward line, a player who lets his brain and his boots do the talking.

Hodgson wanted Sterling and Lallana in the team, but with precious little preparation time before the team travelled to Estonia, he couldn't find a solution. Fabian Delph was earmarked to play ahead of James Milner. Jack Wilshere has been put on such a pedestal by Hodgson that he appears undroppable. Jordan Henderson, who is one of Sterling's close friends, is a fixture in the team because of his ceaseless running.

Sterling, then, unexpectedly provided England's head coach with an opportunity to shuffle the pack. So, how did an organisation that prides itself on sourcing specialists from every conceivable field fail to notice Sterling's introspection?

'You should always try to look for that,' conceded Hodgson. 'Our record over the last two-and-a-half years has not been too bad in terms of looking after players.

'We have very good medical and fitness staff and we do try to consider these things.'

Could they have done better, or has Sterling really burnt out already? Coaches, medical staff, sports scientists, the unit leaders Hodgson has appointed within his squad, could have seen the warning signs.

Saliva tests, a morning routine for the top teams, are supposed to flag up fatigue or duress. Even England's much-trumpeted psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters, who was with the national team for San Marino (but didn't travel to Estonia), failed to realise something was troubling the forward.

Sterling is only 19 and he needs time to adjust to his unexpected, rapid elevation in the game.

You cannot turn on a television, listen to the radio, or attend a Liverpool or England press conference without being told that he is the 'best teenager in football'. To be spoken of in these terms takes some adjustment. Wayne Rooney, becoming a pastoral presence now that he is captain, has spoken to Sterling about these pressures.

Stories abound about Sterling's future, with claims that Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain hope to sign him from Liverpool.

The issues over his £30,0000-a-week contract, reported by Sportsmail 10 days ago, add to the focus on a player who tells friends that he is never happier than when he is out on a pitch with a ball.

In the early hours of Monday, when he stepped off the plane that took the team back to Manchester, his Twitter account was full of vile comments from outraged England fans. Before he took himself off to bed he re-tweeted a couple of them and added, endearingly, 'I'm only human'.

The 19-year-old has become one of Hodgson's most important players in a short space of time

He is a talented boy, but he is operating under different demands now that he has been bracketed among the best teenagers in the world. Suddenly he must win every game for club and country.

It isn't fair, but the wider issue is the inability of the England set-up to notice a potential problem with their star turn.

For the avoidance of any doubt, here is Hodgson's response on Thursday to a question about the England set-up managing the expectations around Sterling.

'We are conscious of managing it,' he said. 'I don't think it will need managing until he shows signs of suffering from it. When Raheem shows signs of not being quite as sharp, not doing as well, trying too hard, that might be the moment we think we have to manage this and give him a break.

'But that is not the case at the moment and I don't think Liverpool need to worry. His first half against San Marino was as lively as it could have been.

'At half time I said, 'I am taking you two (Sterling and Henderson) off', and they looked at me like, 'Don't do that — we want to stay on' and that is quite nice.'

It is possible all the publicity caused Sterling to panic. Judging by his performance in Estonia, where he came on with the game still goalless, the rest has done him good.

He looked revitalised, without a hint of fatigue in his performance, as he went on to win the 74th-minute free-kick on the edge of the area that was despatched beyond Sergei Pareiko by Rooney.

Sterling's is highly unusual behaviour, particularly in a sport that traditionally counts on characters, especially in England, to battle through. Perhaps this incident is confirmation that those gutsy performances we demanded from anyone playing in an England shirt are a thing of the past.

If that is the case, the sport must adapt to these needs.
