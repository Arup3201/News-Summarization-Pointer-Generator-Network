Visitors to this year's Turner Prize exhibition will be met with more than 90 minutes of film to watch - including one of an 'adult nature' and another featuring Marxist equations.

Four artists - Duncan Campbell, Ciara Phillips, James Richards and Tris Vonna-Michell - have been shortlisted for the annual contemporary art prize.

Curator Lizzie Carey-Thomas said visitors who do not like sitting through the whole of a film work do not need to watch the full one hour 34 minutes of film on display, she said, or they could 'come out very resentful'.

Cardiff-born artist Richards, 31, is showing Rosebud (2013), his film which includes partially censored, erotic images from a book found in a Tokyo library.

As well as scenes of puddles, a bird, and the contours of a fingertip, his black-and-white footage also features 'a head of elderflowers trailed lightly over lips, skin and genitals'.

His footage is described as 'poetic meditations on the pleasure, sensuality and the voyeurism that is in the act of looking.'

His film, which has prompted the gallery to warn visitors about the adult nature of some content, uses a 'range of emotional tone' to elicit an emotional response from the viewer, according to curator Ms Carey-Thomas.

His second work, The Screens (2013), features slides from a manual on how to create make-up effects, such as wounds, bruises and blood, for the theatre.

Three of the four artists shortlisted are showing film.

Vonna-Michell's film Finding Chopin: Dans l'Essex, features salt marshes and the Essex coastline and is inspired by a French sound poet who spent part of his life in Essex, close to where the 31-year-old artist grew up.

His other work, Postcript II (2014), is a slide installation based on a story about the artist's mother's childhood in post-war Germany.

Dublin-born Campbell's films - one of which lasts almost an hour - tackle African art and colonialism and equations from Karl Marx's Capital Volume 1.

Ms Carey-Thomas said that all the shortlisted artists tackled a 'lack of fixed meaning' in the world around them in their work.

The predominant use of film in the show responded to 'how we navigate the world increasingly through images', she added.

'The internet changed the way that we interact with each other. It's only natural that the artists respond to that.'

Glasgow-based artist Phillips, 38, is the only artist not to use film in the exhibition - her installation Things Shared features prints.

The Turner Prize, now in its 30th year, has a reputation for controversy.

Previous winners have included Martin Creed's installation featuring a light going on and off and Grayson Perry's pots tackling subjects like death and child abuse.

Art movement the Stuckists usually demonstrate against the exhibition but today they handed out leaflets saying that they would not be protesting 'due to the fact that the prize has sunk to a predictable and pathetic level of elitist repetition that is not worth bothering about'.

The prize, awarded to an artist under 50 born, living or working in Britain, will be presented to a winner on December 1.

The Turner Prize 2014 exhibition opens tomorrow at Tate Britain and runs to January 4 next year.

In its 30-year history, the Turner Prize has never failed to shock and surprise. While it remains to be seen if this year's erotic images by James Richards will trigger any controversy, the award has a long and turbulent history with past finalists attracting heavy criticism and sparking impassioned debates about the meaning and definition of what is art.

Tracey Emin's 1999 display titled My Bed has become one of the more famous pieces associated with the Turner Prize. The artwork, which did not win the prize but was named as one of the shortlisted works, was a recreation of the artist's messy bed as it lay surrounded by cigarette butts, dirty underwear and condoms.

Emin said she created the artwork after a traumatic breakdown in a relationship and the candid and crude display divided critics. Despite not winning the prize, it remains perhaps the most seminal piece of artwork displayed in the history of the Turner Prize.

My Bed was recently sold by art dealer Charles Saatchi - who had bought it for £150,000 in 2000 - in a private auction at Christie's. The mystery buyer paid £2.2million.

Damien Hirst also ranks alongside Emin as one of the most heavily criticised artists involved with the Turner Prize.

His displays featuring animals frozen in formaldehyde have attracted strong debate about the meaning of art and what can be considered an artistic creation, and what is simply a stunt designed to shock audiences.

At the time, Hirst was was heavily criticised for perceived attempts to simply shock audiences but it has become one of the most famous British artworks of the 90s

He first hit the headlines in 1991 when his display The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living was shortlisted for the Turner Prize. The display featured a tiger shark, caught off the coast of Australia, frozen in formaldehyde with its jaws wide open.

Although it was not named as winner, he soon claimed the prize for his 1995 creation A Mother and Child Divided. In much the same fashion, it showed a dissected cow, with all its insides bared, frozen in the formula.
