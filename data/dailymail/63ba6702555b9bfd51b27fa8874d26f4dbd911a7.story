Micah Richards believes Chelsea target Juan Cuadrado has all the attributes to be a huge success in the Premier League and reveals the Fiorentina winger has asked him about England. 

Chelsea are pursuing a deal for the 26-year-old, who was linked with a host of top European clubs after starring at last summer's World Cup, with it looking increasingly likely that Andre Schurrle will join Wolfsburg this January.

The German outfit, who are second in the Bundesliga, are trying to finalise a £23million move for the World Cup-winner, while Mohamed Salah could also leave the club before the transfer window closes.

The inclusion of the Egyptian in the transfer of Cuadrado has also been discussed as the Blues look to tie up a £26.8m deal for the former Udinese wide man.

After playing alongside the Colombia international for the last few months Richards can understand the interest in him and has even offered advice about playing in England.

'After the World Cup I think he had a lot of teams looking at his situation and I've heard all the top teams in England are looking at him, and they should be.

'I train with him every day, he's got everything; technique, speed, power. He's got everything, all the attributes suited to the Premier League. 

'He's loved here at Fiorentina, so if he was to leave the fans would be gutted. But as a player he's got to decide what's best for him. 

'Everybody asks me, "what is England like?" and he was one of the players that asked me, and I told him, "it's really nice. The weather's not as good as Italy, but the football's really good and if you can go there one day it will be good".'
