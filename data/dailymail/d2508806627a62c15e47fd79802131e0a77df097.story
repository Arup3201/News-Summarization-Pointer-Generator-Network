A basketball coach who suffered a brain injury in a car crash that killed his fiancee just days before their wedding has shown 'miraculous' progress in hospital, family friends have said.

John Redman, 25, was driving his bride-to-be, Brittany Huber, 23, from Dalton, Georgia to her hometown of Mobile, Alabama on April 28 when he lost control of his Lexus during a rainstorm.

The car smashed into the median along Interstate 85 in Meriweather County Georgia, killing Huber on impact and leaving him with broken ribs and a head injury.

Amid the tragedy of losing Huber, the families are overjoyed that Redman is showing progress by blinking, smiling and squeezing his hands.

Hope: John Redman, who suffered a brain injury in the car crash that killed his wife-to-be Britanny Huber, left, has shown progress two weeks on by blinking, smiling and squeezing his hands

'John had a miraculous day,' Derek Waugh, the director of athletics at Dalton State College, where Redman works, wrote on his CaringBridge page on Monday. 'He really did some amazing things with respect to cognitive function.'

On Tuesday night he added: 'John has come so far in the last 2 days. A list of progress includes squeezing a mini-basketball, answering questions with multiple eye blinks, making movements on command, smiling at jokes and generally being "aware" of his surroundings and people.'

'These are amazing steps...He has a long road to healing ahead of him but what an amazing 2 days!!!!'

Redman has been treated at Atlanta's Grady Memorial Hospital, but he is being moved to Sheperd Spinal Clinic, which specializes brain and spinal cord injuries.

The 
couple’s wedding was scheduled to take place in Huber’s hometown of 
Mobile, Alabama, Saturday, and the pair were on their way there when the
 fatal accident happened.

Inseparable: The couple had been together since 2011 and were just five days from their wedding

Wreckage: They were driving from Georgia to her hometown of Mobile, Alabama when Redman lost control of his car and smashed into the median, killing his fiancee on impact

Scene: He suffered a brain injury and broken bones in the crash, which occurred on May 28

According to officials, Redman was driving too fast, and the slick road conditions did not play a role in the crash.

The church where the couple were due to marry on Saturday May 3 was instead the venue for her memorial service. Seven women wore matching mint green dresses - their bridesmaids dresses - to the service, AL.com's Tommy Hicks reported.

Redman's
 Facebook page indicates that he and Huber had been together since the 
fall of 2011, and the couple got engaged last June.

In July 2013, the 23-year-old graduate of Spring Hill College was hired as assistant men's basketball coach at Dalton State. His fiancee worked as a kindergarten teacher’s aide at City Park Elementary School.

Huber had a severe hearing impairment since she was a girl, but her students and people who met her for the first time often couldn’t pick up on it because of her uncanny ability to read lips, Times Free Press reported.

Long road ahead: Redman has shown signs of improvement and is being moved to a spinal ward

Redman’s 
mother, former LPGA player Susie Kirk, wrote a heartbreaking message on 
her Facebook page mourning her would-be daughter-in-law.

‘I
 miss my sweet Brittany! I am in shock!!!!!! And I do not think I can 
handle this terrible pain for Brittany's family and for John,’ she 
wrote. ‘It was Brittany and John. It was John and Brittany. End of 
story. They were TEAM REDMAN every day!’

On Monday morning, just hours before her death, Huber posted a photo of their journey, with the caption: 'It is finally wedding week!'

Brittany Huber leaves behind a brother, sister, her parents and a stepmother.
