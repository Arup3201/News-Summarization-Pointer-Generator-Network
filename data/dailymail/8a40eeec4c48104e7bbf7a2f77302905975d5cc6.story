The family of Perth man Paul Weeks, one of the passengers on board Malaysian Airliines flight MH370, are urging the world not to forget their loved one and the other 238 people still missing. 

One year after the plane disappeared, Paul’s mother Prue Tomblin says the families are more desperate than ever to know the truth.

‘I think it's more unbearable now than it was a year ago because we're just totally in limbo,’ she told The West Australian.

‘You just don't know what to feel, what to think. You stumble through the days thinking how can this be possible?’

On March 8, 2014, Paul Weeks  boarded the Boeing 777 flight from Kuala Lumpar bound for Beijing, along with 226 other passengers. An engineer, he was flying to Mongolia for work when the plane disappeared from radar over the South China Sea. His family have heard nothing since. 

Prue Tomblin’s plea comes a day after Prime Minister Tony Abbot announced in Parliament that he ‘could not promise that the search will go on at this intensity forever.’ 

Australian authorities have been leading the search for MH370 since Malaysia Airlines officially declared the loss of the plane an ‘accident’ on January 29.

It has been the largest ever underwater search, so far combing more than 26,800 square kilometres of the Southern Indian ocean floor. But no wreckage has been found.

A total of 26 countries have been involved in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 since it went missing. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said the search, described as the largest, most expensive underwater search ever carried out, 'cannot continue at this intensity forever.'

With the search efforts due to finish in May, Mr Abbott assured families on Thursday that he is confident the operation will succeed.

‘My pledge is that we are taking every reasonable step to bring your uncertainty to an end,’ Mr Abbott told the Parliament. 

It's little comfort to Paul's wife, Danika Weeks, who says she's not coping and she can't move on. 

Ms Weeks has told WHO Magazine that every morning is difficult. In fact, 'it's getting worse.'

She spends 'a lot more time in bed', she's taking anti-depressants to help her cope and her youngest son Lincoln screams at her to bring his father back.

A year on, Ms Weeks says she's frustrated with Malaysian Authorities telling the families to move beyond MH370. 

'How do you move? We don't get to move beyond! We will never get to move beyond. So how can they just move beyond this and forget about it?' she said in a candid interview with SBS's dateline program last month. 

Malaysia is expected to release an interim report on its investigation into the disappearance on Saturday.
