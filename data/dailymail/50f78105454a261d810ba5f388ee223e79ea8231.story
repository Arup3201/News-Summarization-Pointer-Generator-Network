Police in Philadelphia are investigating whether a vicious attack on a New Yorker who had returned home for Thanksgiving was part of the sick 'Knockout Game' that is being perpetuated on social media and causing chaos on the streets.

Manhattan chef Diego Moya, 30, was having a pizza slice while working home from meeting friends about 11pm Tuesday when he was ambushed by a group of six to eight men, aged from 16 to 21.

Defenseless, he was punched and kicked repeatedly and suffered a broken jaw and nose, reports CBS Philly.

Serious Condition: Manhattan chef Diego Moya, 30, was on a Thanksgiving visit to Philadelphia when he was bashed by a group of men about 11pm Tuesday in a suspected 'knockout game' attack

Before the attack: Diego Moya is seen here in a shot of him at work in New York. He suffered a broken jaw and nose and had to undergo serious surgery as a result of his assault

Moya was taken to hospital and had to undergo several hours of surgery for his injuries.

Deflatedly he wrote about the experience on his Facebook page.

'I am sad. I wish I was mad but I sit here in this hospital bed sad,' Moya posted.

Deputy Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel says detectives are looking for the motive for the attack, but have determined it random.

They are also looking into whether it is linked to the 'knockout game' that has claimed several victims across the country.

The prank preys of innocent people in the street, with 'players' aiming to knockout passersby by with just one hit.

It is then bragged about online.

It was 11pm Tuesday night when Diego Moya was attacked by a gang of men here at Market Street between 2nd and 3rd in Philadelphia

'They just want to see if you got enough strength to knock somebody out,' one person posted anonymously on social media.

In Philadelphia alone, there have been three other knockout-related assaults.

According to NJ.com, one man in New Jersey has died from a broken neck as a result of the so-called game.

On Monday, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter and Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey held a press conference warning there would be serious consequences for anyone taking part in 'knockout' attacks.

Sweeping the country: Innocent people all over America have been targeted as part of the 'knockout game', as this video grab shows. Doctors say it is more dangerous than being hit in a fight because the unexpectedness affects the way your body handles the assault

Hit from behind: This victim had no idea they were about to be attacked when they were knocked out on the street in daylight

'You’re also hurting another human being for no reason at all' Nutter said.

'There’s no excuse for this kind of behavior, it will not be tolerated here in the city.

'We will do everything we can to both prevent, but if someone does engage, we will catch you.

'You’ll be prosecuted, and your life will be changed dramatically.'

So far, no suspects are in custody for the attack on Moya.
