First Minister Alex Salmond was mauled during last week's TV independence debate over his refusal to spell out a 'Plan B' if Westminster refuses to allow Scotland to use the pound

Alex Salmond is 'running out of opportunities' to win next month's independence referendum it was claimed today - as a new poll showed a huge lead for the 'No' camp. 

A survey, carried out amid the fallout from last week’s TV showdown between Mr Salmond and the former Chancellor Alistair Darling, gives the pro-UK campaign a 22-point lead over the nationalists.

The findings come just five weeks before voters north of the border go to the polls in the September 18 referendum.

More than 1,100 Scots were asked their voting intentions between Monday and Thursday last week – coinciding with Tuesday’s independence debate.

According to the YouGov poll, published in the Sun today, some 55 per cent of Scottish voters now plan to vote No to independence, compared to just 35 per cent who plan to vote Yes.

But once the ‘don’t knows’ are stripped out, the No camp lead by 61 to 39 per cent.

Polling expert Anthony Wells, of YouGov, said Mr Salmond was running out of time to turn his poll ratings around.

He said: ‘Yes campaigners had hoped that the Commonwealth Games would have narrowed the gap and it hasn’t.

‘With five weeks to go and a 20 point No lead to overturn, the Yes Scotland campaign need a game-changer and are running out of opportunities.’

Better Together campaign director Blair McDougall added: 'Alex Salmond's failure to be honest with Scots about his Plan B on currency is costing him votes. 

'It's clear that the momentum in this campaign is with those of us who believe the brightest future for Scotland is to remain part of the UK.

'Alex Salmond wants us to take a leap into the unknown with independence. He wants us to take a huge risk with the future of our country. Yet he can't tell us what money our wages, pensions and benefits would be paid in.

'He can't say what currency we would use to invest in our schools and hospitals. And he can't be clear about what money we would be paying our supermarket and energy bills in.'

Mr Darling, the leader of the pro-UK Better Together campaign, added: ‘This is yet another encouraging poll.

‘However, we are in no way complacent. There are just six weeks to go and we will be fighting for every vote.

‘What is clear, though, is that the closer we get the more people are looking at the nationalists plans and realising that they make no sense.’

But a spokesman for Yes Scotland said: ‘This poll is unchanged from the last YouGov poll in June.

‘Two other polls in the past week have shown support for Yes as high as 47 per cent — including the snap poll conducted after last week’s debate.’

‘Yes vote is Scotland’s one opportunity to protect the NHS from Westminster privatisation, create more jobs in Scotland, and transform childcare instead of wasting billions of pounds on Trident nuclear weapons.’

Today’s YouGov poll also showed that 39 per cent of Scots believed there should not be another referendum if Scotland votes No.

Just a quarter of Scots believe say there should be another poll within a decade, while 17 per cent say it should not be for at least another 20 or 30 years.

Alex Salmond, the First Minister of Scotland, and Alistair Darling, the chairman of Better Together, took part in a live television debate hosted by Bernard Ponsonby at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow last week

Today’s findings follow last week’s TV mauling of Mr Salmond by the Labour MP Mr Darling. 

The SNP leader was lambasted over his failure to tell voters what would happen if Westminster refused to allow to Scots to use the pound after independence.

Following his disastrous TV performance Mr Salmond insisted there was no acceptable 'Plan B' if an independent Scotland is barred from using the British pound.

The First Minister said dropping the pound 'implies settling for what's second best' - but still insisted there will be a deal on a currency union with the rest of the UK.

Mr Salmond has also reiterated his threat to refuse to pay Scotland's share of the national debt if he is barred from using the pound.

He said: 'That means taxpayers in the rest of the UK would be lumbered with up to £5billion a year in debt interest payments.

'And Scotland would start life as an independent country debt-free. That's just one of the many good reasons there will be a currency union.'

The poll, carried out after the live debate between Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond and Better Together campaign leader Alistair Darling, shows nearly a quarter of viewers are now more likely to reject independence

During Tuesday’s bruising TV debate with Mr Darling, when Mr Salmond failed to answer questions about his ‘plan B’, the First Minister has claimed ‘it’s Scotland’s pound and we’re keeping it’.

Polls following the debate showed that 56 per cent of Yes voters want Mr Salmond to draw up a ‘plan B’, with only 35 per cent content for the First Minister to remain silent.

The alternatives are a separate Scottish currency – either pegged to the pound or with a flexible exchange rate - joining the euro, or using the pound unilaterally in the way that East Timor and Panama use the U.S. dollar.

Keeping the pound is by far the preferred option for Scots, but if a deal is ruled out a separate currency pegged to the pound is the most popular, according to the poll.

Mr Salmond has gambled his political future on convincing voters that Labour, the Tories and the Lib Dems are bluffing when they said they would rule out a currency union.

The poll shows that 40 per cent agree with this, and 39 per cent of Scots believe they are telling the truth.
