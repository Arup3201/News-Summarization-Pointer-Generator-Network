His party may be down in the polls, but Silvio Berlusconi still looks like the cat who got the cream as he enjoys a romantic meal with his young fiancee.

The 76-year-old politician - who is seeking a return to power at the end of the month - can be seen grinning from ear to ear as his 27-year-old partner Francesca Pascale kisses him on the cheek.

The pair - who have an age gap close to 50 years - were pictured enjoying a pre-Valentine's day meal at the exclusive Capricci Sicilliani restaurant in Rome last night.

Age gap: Silvio Berlusconi, at 76, is nearly 50 years older than his 27-year-old partner Francesca Pascale

It comes as polls suggest Berlusconi returning to power won't happen, despite his party's revival from near-death last year.

The most probable outcome remains a victory of the centre-left coalition led by Pier Luigi Bersani's Democratic Party (PD) in the lower house.

But Berlusconi and his future wife - who is nearly a third his age - looked far from worried last night.

Ms Pascale - a member of Berlusconi's People of Liberty party - can be seen whispering into the former Italian Prime Minister's ear and nuzzling his next.

Optimistic: The couple were enjoying a pre-Valentine's Day meal despite Berlusconi's party being down in the polls

The couple appear to be eating a meal with friends but don't let that stop them from performing some very public displays of affection.

Miss Pascale, a former shop assistant from Naples, served as a provincial councillor in his centre-Right PDL party before stepping down in July.

A founding member of a support group called 'Silvio, we miss you', she has previously said the three most important things in her life are her family, politics and Mr Berlusconi.

It is said she is jealous of the other women in his inner circle, including a glamour model Mara Carfagna whom he appointed equal opportunities minister during his last term as Prime Minister.

The billionaire confirmed their relationship on television, calling her 'beautiful on the inside and the outside'. 'Finally I feel less lonely,' Mr Berlusconi said. 'I am engaged to a Neapolitan, it’s official.'

Berlusconi has been married twice and has five children. In 1965, he married Carla Elvira Dall'Oglio, and they had two children.

He later had three more children with his second wife, the actress Veronica Lario, from whom he is separated.

Berlusconi has since been ordered to pay Lario £29 million a year in a divorce settlement - which works out as £82,000 a day.

That's four times the average annual salary for an ordinary Italian but small change to Mr Berlusconi, who has a personal fortune of more than £5 billion.

Over the years, Mr Berlusconi has been linked with a string of glamorous young women, including models, actors, showgirls and prostitutes who attended his notorious 'bunga bunga' sex parties at his mansions.

In July last year, the former Prime Minister was forced to deny allegations by a model who claimed that she was pregnant with his sixth child.

Sabina Began - who earned her nickname 'Queen Bee' for her alleged lead role in the infamous Buna Bunga parties - claimed she was expecting the controversial politician's baby but has since lost it.

The 38-year-old German model and actress told Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano she was sure it was his child as she had 'only slept with him'.

Berlusconi is also accused of paying Karima el-Mahroug - known as 'Ruby the heartstealer' for sex when she was just 17 during his bunga bunga parties, and using his office to cover it up. Both deny the accusations.
