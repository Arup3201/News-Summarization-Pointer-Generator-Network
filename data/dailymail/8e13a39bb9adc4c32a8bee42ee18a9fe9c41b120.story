The family of the British football coach brutally stabbed to death in New York flew to the U.S. to join hundreds of mourners gathered at his funeral service.

Michael Jones, 25, from Tarleton, near Preston, was stabbed multiple times in a 'frenzied' attack in Manhattan in the early hours of Sunday morning following a night out with his girlfriend.

Mr Jones - described as a 'great person' and a 'real gentleman' - moved to the U.S. five years ago to coach youth players with the New York Red Bulls soccer team, and had been hoping to remain in America permanently.

Mr Jones' father Perry, 50, and mother Carole, 53, are understood to have been flown to Tuesday's service - which was packed with players and friends wearing shirts emblazoned with the 25-year-old's nickname, 'Jonesy' - by the Red Bulls.

Mr Jones senior has told how his son loved living in the U.S. and working with young players.

'He loved New York and he loved the 
lifestyle and he was working and hoping to get a visa so he could stay 
there full time,' he told the BBC.

He said he and his wife received a Facebook message from one of his son's friends on Sunday telling him to call the NYPD.

Mr Jones used to coach Cole Reardon, 12, who described him as 'a great person'.

'I've known Jonesy since I was little, since I was seven,' he said.

'He was one of my favorite coaches. He was always a great person, and he would always help me, and joke around. He could be strict but off the field he was fun.'

On the night he was killed, Mr Jones had been out in Manhattan with his girlfriend, Bryeanna Murphy, 23, from Mamaroneck, New York.

The Liverpool F.C. fan was attacked near Union 
Square after what police believe to have been a case of mistaken identity.

The suspect, who has been identified as 
either Orlando Orea or Orlando Gutierrez, is accused of stabbing Jones 
six times and savagely hacking off one of his ears early Sunday morning 
before leaving him to bleed to death.

Following an incorrect report that the suspect was in police custody, he managed to flee the country after reportedly buying a one-way ticket on an Aero Mexico flight with cash moments before it was scheduled to leave from Kennedy International Airport on Tuesday morning.

Miss Murphy's father said his daughter had been left devastated by her boyfriend's death.

'She can't believe it has happened,' he said.

He described Mr Jones, who had been dating his daughter for six months, as 'a real gentleman.'

He added: 'He was a lovely guy. Good mannered, good fun, just the kind of guy you'd want your daughter to go out with.'

The couple spent Saturday night in Manhattan's East Village visiting a friend's apartment. They parted at around 11.30pm and Mr Jones and a group of friends visited several nightclubs in the city.

Mr Murphy said that his daughter last heard from Mr Jones at midnight. She was home by 2am and went to sleep.

'She didn't know anything was wrong,' he said.

Despite
the boy's' night out, Mr Jones dutifully called his girlfriend several 
times throughout the evening - including just before he was killed.

Thoughts of the ongoing manhunt for Mr
Jones' killer were put aside at Tuesday's emotional service, which 
featured glowing tributes to the popular coach.

'(It) was tearful, a lot of memory of 
Jonesey; but at the same time a lot of smiles,' said Dave Jervis, the 
Red Bulls’ director of training programs.

'As much of a tragedy as it is, we want to celebrate Michael’s life, and his friends and all the people he knew here,' he told The New York Post.

Surveillance video shows Mr Jones next
to his pony-tailed killer about 4.15am on Sunday on West 14th Street, 
according to the Post.

The footage shows 
two men appear to exchange words and begin to argue. The suspect then 
suddenly pushes Mr Jones against a building and pulls out a knife.

A medical examiner ruled that Mr Jones died of stab wound to his chest and stomach, including a puncture in his heart.

A piece of his ear was found on the pavement, and his wounds were so severe police initially believed they were dealing with a Halloween prank.

Mr Jones had spent five years coaching children aged three to 13 with the New York Red Bulls, whose senior team includes former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry and ex-Everton star Tim Cahill.
