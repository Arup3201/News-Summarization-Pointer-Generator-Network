A couple have transformed a disused city centre factory into one of Britain's  most energy-efficient homes - which costs just £300 per year to run.

Julian Marsh and his wife Judy Liebert began the project to convert a former  meat factory into a beacon of green technology in 2009.

Now, five years later, the home is in the running to be crowned the greenest  home in Britain.

It features a waterless composting toilet, translucent walls to reduce the need  for electric lighting and corridors on the outside the insulate the central  rooms.

How it looks now: Architect Julian Marsh and Judy Liebert pictured standing in front of their Eco-home which has become one of the greenest in the country

Before: Julian Marsh bought this disused meat factory building in 2009 for £150,000 with the intention of transforming it into a beacon of green technology

Transformation: The meat factory is now a spacious home filled with natural light throughout the building

Julian, 63, an architect professor at
 Sheffield Hallam University, South  Yorkshire, said: 'It's a huge 
honour that our house has been named as one of the  greenest in the UK -
 and it would be great if it was awarded as the greenest.

'Judy
 and I are very proud of the work we have done and it's great that our  
efforts have been recognised. It would be an amazing triumph to win but 
it isn't everything to us.

'We just want to prove that it is possible, even in an urban environment, to  build homes which are environmentally friendly.

'We haven't got much time to start taking our energy consumption, and the  effect it is having on the planet, seriously.'

After spending £150,000 to buy the former factory in Nottingham, the 
couple  invested a further £500,000 to knock the building down, 
decontaminate the land  and build the property.

Costly: The couple spent £500,000 knocking the building down, decontaminating the land and building the new property

Back to basics: The eco-home has a composting toilet which requires the user to scoop a handful of wood shavings provided in the soak box into the toilet bowl

Supplies: As the toilet doesn't flush, the couple keep a soak box well stocked with wood shavings

Office space: Julian Marsh has designed the property to perfectly fit his needs - and has built his own office in the building

Artist
 Judy, 67, said: 'It's been a big expense and a big project to take on, 
 but we have built an efficient, beautiful house, that serves our 
practical and  leisure needs perfectly - but does not pollute the 
environment any more than it  absolutely has to.'

The completed property uses just £300 worth of energy and water a year.

Explaining
 how the composting toilet works, Julian said: 'It's like a wick  
chamber which you have to empty every couple of years. It's perfectly 
hygienic - there's no smell.'

He added: 'We're great believers in living a low energy life - this is just  taking that to the next level.'

Outside
 the house there are solar panels on the roof and a central courtyard  
with a plentiful supply of fruit and vegetables growing.

Up to a public vote: The couple hope their home will be voted the greenest in the UK in a competition in May

Long process: The couple spent a total of five years transforming the property which has been renovated with Eco-friendly materials

Sustainable living: Judy Liebert is pictured in the property's garden where the couple are growing herbs, flowers and vegetables

Passages
 and stairs are on the outside of the house to act as a climate buffer  
to the living space within. Internal doors and windows have been planned
 to allow hot and cold currents to  funnel throughout the winter and 
summer respectively.

There
 is also a cistern which collects rain water to be reused for washing 
and  a heat pump which draws sandstone from 70 meters below the ground. Insulation  is made from hemp.

Julian,
 who is a father-of-two and grandfather-of-three, said: 'We are right by
  a bus stop and only ten minutes from a train station too, both of 
which improve  our green credentials.'

Now the couple have built their dream house they say they have no intention of  leaving.

Award-winning: Julian Marsh was given a Civic Trust Award in 2011 recognising 'excellence in the built environment'

Pioneering: The couple hope their home will help inspire others to make their own properties more Eco-friendly

'We have built a home for life - a home that we can grow old together in,' said  Julian. 'We are both very happy.'

But
 the couple have said that being shortlisted for the Guardian 
newspaper's  green building award - the winners to be announced next 
month - is just he icing on  the cake.

Julian
 said: 'It was very unexpected. We didn't have to enter the competition 
or anything, they just got in touch to  say we had been selected.

He added: 'We designed the house to fit in with the life we wanted to lead, but  it's great to be recognised.

Money saver: The completed property uses just £300 worth of energy and water a year - making it significantly cheaper than less energy efficient homes

Stepping back in time: The couple also use a traditional larder in place of a fridge to keep their produce fresh

Natural sources: The property's insulation is made from hemp and there is a heat pump which draws sandstone from 70 meters below the ground
