San Lorenzo booked their place in the FIFA Club World Cup final against Real Madrid after the South American champions ended a surprise tournament run by minnows Auckland City with a laboured 2-1 semi-final victory on Wednesday night.

Madrid will be the favourites on Saturday after San Lorenzo needed extra time to get past Auckland's team of part-timers and amateurs who fit their football around day jobs.

It would have been the ultimate David vs Goliath story had the Oceania champions advanced to face the Galacticos. A shock seemed possible when Angel Berlanga's second-half goal cancelled out Pablo Barrientos' first-half strike for San Lorenzo. But substitute Mauro Matos netted San Lorenzo's winner in extra time.
