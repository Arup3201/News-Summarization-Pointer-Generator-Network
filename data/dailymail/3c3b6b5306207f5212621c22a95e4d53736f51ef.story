Mr Justice Tugendhat told her 'unwelcome publicity' received after affair with Mr Huhne was 'situation entirely of her own making'

MP Chris Huhne's partner Carina Trimingham has lost her privacy and harassment claim against Associated Newspapers, which publishes the Daily Mail.

Her affair with the former secretary of state for energy and climate change became public in June 2010, with Mr Huhne leaving his wife of 26 years.

The 44-year-old PR adviser sued for compensation and an injunction over 65 'highly unpleasant and hurtful' articles which have appeared since then. She claimed she was subject to 'crude and demeaning stereotypes' about her being bisexual.

Dismissed: Carina Trimingham gives a statement today outside the High Court after today's hearing

But despite Ms Trimingham's lawyers claiming the stories constituted a 'cataclysmic interference' with her private life, a High Court judge today rejected her claim on the grounds that her involvement with the former energy secretary was 'a situation of her own making'.

The High Court judge also said he had not found Ms Trimingham to be a good or reliable witness in a number of respects.

Associated Newspapers described the ruling by Mr Justice Tugendhat as 'an important example of the press exercising its right to free speech'.

Associated Newspapers had contested Ms Trimingham's case on the basis that there was an important public interest.

Ms Trimingham's counsel, Matthew Ryder QC, said the Daily Mail had a right to freedom of expression but not to abuse her repeatedly under the guise of exercising that freedom.

Ms Trimingham was in court today but showed no emotion as her claim was dismissed by the judge.

He said: 'Ms Trimingham was not the purely private figure she claims to be. Her reasonable expectation of privacy has become limited.

'This is mainly by reason of her involvement with Mr Huhne, both professionally, as his press agent, and personally as his secret mistress, in circumstances where he campaigned with a leaflet to the electorate of Eastleigh about how much he valued his family.

'But it is also by reason of what she herself has disclosed in the past.

'Further, she was, as the defendant knew, a journalist who had herself disclosed information about other people for publication in the newspapers and so was a person who ought not reasonably to be expected to be distressed when such information was published about herself.'

'Ms Trimingham has shown little sign of recognising how what she herself has done has given rise to the publicity she finds so unwelcome.'The difficult situation she found herself in was of her own making.

Ms Trimingham, speaking today on the steps of the High Court, was not found to be a good or reliable witness during her claim by Mr Justice Tugendhat

'One reason why it is objectionable for a sexual relationship to arise between people who are already in a professional or work relationship is that there is then a greatly increased risk of conflicts arising between professional duty and personal interest.'

It was this crossing of boundaries which led an editorial executive on the newspaper to consider that Ms Trimingham's role in the story of Mr Huhne was so significant, he added.

'Professionally, it was her job to ensure that Mr Huhne received the best possible publicity, but it was the sexual affair on which she embarked, and which she continued to conduct, with Mr Huhne that gave rise to the scandal.

He added that although Associated referred to Ms Trimingham's sexuality in 65 articles over 15 months, it only did so when writing about matters of public interest - mainly developments in Mr Huhne's personal life which were relevant to his public life - and when Ms Trimingham, her conduct and other information about her were within the range of what an editor could in good faith regard as relevant to the story.

'The distress that she has undoubtedly suffered since June 19, 2010 is the result of the publication by the defendant of the defamatory and true information concerning her, about which she has not made a claim in defamation, and the actions of journalists and publishers for whom the defendant is not responsible.

'To the extent that the words complained of include insults and other offensive matter, insulting and offensive speech is protected by the right of freedom of expression.

'In this case what Ms Trimingham complains of is not so unreasonable that it is necessary or proportionate to sanction or prohibit such publications in order to protect the rights of Ms Trimingham.

'So the defendant has not harassed her within the meaning of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. It is not the case that a reasonable person in the position of the defendant ought to have known that these articles, separately, or cumulatively, amount to harassment of Ms Trimingham.'

He added that Ms Trimingham had no reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to various items of information, including cropped versions of photos taken at her civil partnership ceremony, which revealed no more information about her than the public already knew.

Ms Trimingham was not the purely private figure she claims to be. Her reasonable expectation of privacy has become limited.'

Outside court, Ms Trimingham said she intended to appeal.

Ms Trimingham, who is insured, was ordered to pay £250,000 towards Associated’s costs.

A spokesman for Associated Newspapers said: 'This was an important example of the press exercising its right to free speech in relation to matters of significant public interest.

A High Court judge told Ms Trimingham, pictured left today and right at the Lib Dem Annual Conference last September, that she was in a situation 'of her own making'

'We are pleased that the Court agreed with us and has today dismissed all of Miss Trimingham’s complaints.

'The references to Miss Trimingham’s sexuality in our coverage were never pejorative, private or in any way homophobic.

'Miss Trimingham chose to level some very serious charges against our journalists in this case. This judgement vindicates both our journalists and their journalism.

Media law specialist Mark Stephens said Mr Justice Tugendhat, in his judgment, had drawn a distinction between private and public figures by importing the American notion of a public figure.

'It is redolent of the approach taken to Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky,' he said.

'Mr Clinton, as president, had a restricted zone of privacy, and Ms Lewinsky's zone of privacy was reduced by virtue of her relationship with him.

'It appears that that ratio was very similar in this case.'
