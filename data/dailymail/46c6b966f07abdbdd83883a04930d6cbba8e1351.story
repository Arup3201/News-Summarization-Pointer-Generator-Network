This is the shocking moment a white van driver rammed another car out of the way so he could park his vehicle in a particular parking space.

CCTV footage shows the white van pulling up behind a black Peugeot 207, which is parked on a residential street in Sheerness, Kent, before shunting it forward several yards.

The driver then gets out of his vehicle and brazenly walks around the front of his van, between the two vehicles, before disappearing down an alleyway.

Father-of-two Mr Lassman said his car was left on the kerb and with hundreds of pounds worth of damage

Dan Lassman, 23, who owns the Peugeot, said he had parked it outside his home and was perplexed when he went outside and realise it had been moved. 

He said his car had been shoved onto the kerb and had suffered hundreds of pounds worth of damage.

The father-of-two said: 'I had been in that day and I came out at about 5pm to get my son from nursery and I just knew I hadn't parked my car there.

'So I asked my partner if she had driven it and she said no so I went to have a look and there were paint chips and scrapes over the back of the car.

'When it's a fairly newish car, you don't want people damaging it.

'During the day it can be a bit of a free-for-all on the road because you do get a lot of people who park and walk into town rather than pay for a ticket or you get a lot of the staff in town but there's quite a lot of free space.'

Mr Lassman, who is training to be a lorry driver, added that there was damage to the boot and rear bumper of his vehicle.

After making the discovery, he spoke to his neighbour Dennis Smith who let him access the CCTV footage from the front of his house.

Mr Lassman managed to spot the white van bumping his car and reported the incident, which happened just before 2.30pm on Monday, to police.

His girlfriend, who does not wish to be named, shares the car with her partner and said they will now have to fork out hundreds of pounds for it to be repainted.

The call centre operator said: 'Dan came in and asked me if I'd been driving it because it was hanging off the kerb.

'He thought it was just "women driving" but I'd been ill all day and hadn't left the house.

'We saw the damage, the paint had all come away and it's really scratched.

'We're hoping to catch the van driver so we can claim on his insurance or we'll have to pay out hundreds of pounds as we were due to sell it shortly.'

A Kent Police spokesman confirmed the incident had been reported to the force.

After the incident, the driver parks his van before climbing out of the vehicle and walking behind his vehicle

The driver then appears from the other side of his van before walking between the two vehicles. Mr Lassman, who obtained the CCTV from a neighbour, has reported the incident, which occurred on Monday, to police
