The wife of disgraced British-born tycoon Alan Bond has been found dead at the couple’s luxury beachside mansion.

It is understood the body of former airline stewardess Diana Bliss, 57, was found by her husband floating in the swimming pool and that he tried desperately to resuscitate her.

Flamboyant Bond – who was jailed for fraud, lost a fortune and bounced back to make another – may have raised the alarm himself.

Neighbours in Cottesloe, a suburb of Perth in Western Australia, said Ms Bliss had been struggling with personal problems.

Residents said she had lost a lot  of 
weight recently and had been  battling anxiety and depression for 
several years. One said she had received treatment for depression in a 
London clinic last year.

Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘I saw her a week ago and she looked terrible.’

Police said last night that there were
no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of Australian-born Ms
Bliss, the daughter of a Methodist minister.

A police spokesman said: ‘About 
11.30am local time, Western Australian Police were notified by St John 
Ambulance of a deceased woman at Hawkstone Street, Cottesloe.’

The spokesman said a report would be sent to the coroner.

The tragedy comes 12 years after 
Bond’s daughter Susanne Edwards – the second of his four children – died
at her Perth home aged 41 after apparently overdosing on prescription 
drugs.

Ms Bliss, who had worked as a Qantas 
flight attendant, in public relations and later as a successful theatre 
producer, married Bond in 1995 after he had been discharged as a 
bankrupt.

He was divorced from his first wife, Eileen, three years earlier.

Bond, 73, who emigrated with his 
parents from London to Australia in 1950, began as a signwriter but went
on to become a multi-millionaire whose investments in airships, 
property, breweries and diamond mines enabled him to bankroll challenges
for the America’s Cup, the premier international yacht race.

In 1983, his Australia II Syndicate won the trophy, which had been  held by the New York Yacht Club since 1851.

In 1987, Bond controversially bought 
Vincent van Gogh’s Irises for £36 million – at the time the highest 
price paid for a single painting.

But the purchase was subsidised by a 
substantial loan from auctioneer Sotheby’s, which Bond failed to repay. 
Art experts suggested it may have been a manipulated sale designed to 
artificially inflate the value.

After his empire collapsed, Bond was 
declared bankrupt in 1992 with personal debts of £1.2 billion. He was 
jailed for seven years in 1997 after pleading guilty to using his 
controlling interest in the Bell Resources company to siphon off more 
than £800 million into the  coffers of his Bond Corporation. He served 
four years in jail and since then he has worked with his son, Craig, to 
build up a new fortune in oil and diamonds.

By 2008, Bond was said to be worth about £170 million.

Family spokesman Sue Parks said yesterday that they did not want to comment on the death.
