Poachers have killed a family of 11 elephants in the biggest mass shooting of the animals on record in Kenya, wildlife officials have said.

A gang of about ten attackers hacked off the elephants' tusks in Tsavo East National Park, on Saturday, in the latest sign of a resurgence of demand for ivory jewellery and ornaments, mainly coming from Asia.

The Kenya Wildlife Service has now said foot, dog and aerial units were hunting the gang.

In a statement the service said: 'The entire family of 11 elephants have been confirmed poached and tusks chopped off. All the carcasses had bullet wounds.'

Elephant poaching in Kenya declined sharply after 1989 when the government banned trade in ivory.

But there has been a rise in the illegal practice in recent years.

Kenya Wildlife Service spokesman Paul Udo said the latest killing was the worst single incident of its kind recorded in the East African country.

He said: '(It) shows the great lengths these criminal cartels are ready to go to get ivory. It's really tragic.'

Demand for ornamental ivory is rising fast in Asia in tandem with growing Chinese influence and investment in Africa.

In May, 359 tusks weighing 1.6 tonnes impounded in Sri Lanka were found to have come from Kenya's Mombasa port.

Police found 214 tusks worth $1.32 million hidden in a coffin and fertiliser bags in neighbouring Tanzania in October.

The force said smugglers had planned to transport the ivory to Kenya for onward shipment to Asia. Â
