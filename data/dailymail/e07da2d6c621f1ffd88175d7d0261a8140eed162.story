Takeaways in Beijing are facing a kebab crackdown launched by officials in a bid to clear the air in the smog-ridden city.

Smoky outdoor grills will be banned from May 1, move that will hit the city's popular street-food vendors, but which officials hope will clean up its noxious air.

The plan has already raised hackles among the many Beijingers who, during the city's sweltering summers, gather round sidewalk tables, drink beer and eat food cooked in the street.

Contempt is already palpable amongst the city's microbloggers, who point out that China's heavy industries are a much bigger source of emissions than its takeaways.

The new rules, which also target street-food vendors serving popular cold dishes, are intended to help preserve food safety and control smog, state-owned China News Service reported on its website.

Popular snacks like garlic cucumber salad and cold tofu skin will likely no longer be sold outdoors, the news report said.

Grills where skewers of lamb, beef, chicken wings and vegetables are cooked must be moved inside.

Years of runaway economic growth have 
devastated Chinaâ€™s environment, and pollution is a major source of 
public dissatisfaction and unrest.

The government has said tackling pollution is one of its top priorities.

At
 the same time, food safety scares, from cadmium-tainted rice to reused 
cooking oil, have also plagued the country and weighed on consumer 
confidence.

The head of 
Beijingâ€™s Foreign Affairs Office was lampooned by microbloggers last 
October when he claimed stir frying was a big cause of air pollution.

Today the country's microbloggers reacted to the grill ban with similar scorn.

'The whole environment has been destroyed, and industrial pollution and overuse of cars are the primary reasons,' one user wrote.

'What is the point of preventing Beijingers from eating cucumber salad outside?'
