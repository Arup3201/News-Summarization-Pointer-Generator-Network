A Missouri elementary school teacher has been jailed accused of nearly killing a Missouri City police officer after she lost control of the car she was driving and very nearly hit him.

46-year-old Christie Diane Biggers was intoxicated when she crashed into the back of Officer Kenneth Lewis' patrol car which was on a bridge at the time, having just pulled over another driver.

In order to avoid being pinned between the cars and the railing, he was forced to make the quick decision to go over the railing.

Quite a drop! The police officer said he didn't realize just how far it was over the side of the bridge before jumping

Missouri City police say the Sugar Land Police Department is now investigating the cause of the crash.

Ms Biggers is a PE teacher at Scanlan Oaks Elementary School where she had worked since 2000.

Officers at the scene report blood shot eyes and alcohol on her breath. She said she was heading home from a restaurant and bar. Investigators say she failed a field sobriety test.

She has been charged with intoxication assault and is now in Fort Bend County Jail.

Lieutenant Paul Poulton said that Lewis is stable and still recovering.

'In a situation like this you can't plan or prepare for it,' he explained. 'We take safety precautions when stopping any vehicle.'

'He had a partially ruptured aorta that had to be repaired,' said Lt. Poulton. 'Now they're looking at his fractured pelvis to decide if they have to do surgery on it or not.'

Lewis is the father of three and has medical insurance.

His family still has hospital parking fees and child care to pay and need community support. Click here if you would like to help the officer's family.
