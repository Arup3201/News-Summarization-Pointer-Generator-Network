Margaret Thatcher was warned that her financial sector reforms would lead to a new culture of ‘unscrupulous’ practices in the City, according to newly-released government papers.

Her most senior official, Cabinet secretary Sir Robert Armstrong, set out his ‘increasing disquiet’ about ‘the things that people think are going on in the City’.

He said that a ‘bubble’ was being created that would be ‘pricked’ and said that ‘corners were being cut’ and money made in ways ‘that are at least bordering on the unscrupulous’.

Margaret Thatcher was warned that her financial sector reforms would lead to a new culture of ‘unscrupulous’ practices in the City in the 1980s

Independent regulation was the only solution to the problem, Sir Robert argued.

Critics claim that Mrs Thatcher’s reform of the financial sector paved the way for the ‘loadsamoney’ era and the future financial crisis of 2007 which led to economic downturn.

The memo came just months before the Big Bang - the deregulation of the London Stock Exchange and its replacement with electronic trading floors and foreign investors.

It was so called because the change meant a huge increase in activity and established London as the premier international financial centre and brought huge wealth to City workers.

But it was also a period also of financial scandals - most notably the Guinness share-rigging affair which involved an attempt to manipulate the stock market.

In an extraordinary memorandum contained in files released by the National Archives in Kew, west London, Sir Robert put down on paper his doubts about the effect the changes were having.

His note, dated March 17 1986, seven months before the Big Bang, was addressed to Mrs Thatcher’s private secretary Nigel Wicks, who would almost certainly have shown it to her.

While he acknowledged his concerns were ‘pretty vague and unspecific’, he said that he was by no means alone in harbouring such doubts.

‘I do not know whether you are having the same experience but I am finding, among people who work outside the City of London but whose activities bring them into touch in some degree with the City, that there is increasing disquiet about the things that people think are going on in the City,’ he wrote.

‘I do not just mean the levels of remuneration; a lot of people, including some from inside the City, think that is a bubble that will be pricked in a year or two.

‘They think more about the way in which corners are being cut and money is being made in ways that are at least bordering on the unscrupulous.

‘It tends to be summed up by the people saying that they doubt whether it really is good enough any more to leaving the policing of the City to self-regulation.

‘I’m afraid that all this is pretty vague and unspecific; but I find it sufficiently prevalent to be concerned.’

Mrs Thatcher received an altogether rosier assessment from David Willetts, who was then working in the No 10 policy unit and who co-authored a paper for her on the likely impact of Big Bang.

The paper dismissed concerns that it could lead to a repeat of the ‘boom and bust’ which followed previous City deregulation in 1971 when a property boom was followed by a market collapse and a banking crisis.

‘This does not mean that there might not be individual financial failures as a result of bad commercial decisions, but we do not expect a systemic problem,’ the paper noted.
