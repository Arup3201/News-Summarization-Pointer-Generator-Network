A mother-of-four was today mourning the death of one of her beloved Shih Tzus after it was attacked by two Staffordshire bull terriers during a walk.

Debra Forman, 48, of Oldham, Greater Manchester, saw her ‘worst nightmare’ come true when tiny seven-year-old Ebony was killed after the vicious dogs launched an unprovoked attack.

She said she was terrified when the dogs attacked her two beloved pets, and claimed the bull terriers’ owner was talking to someone else while her dogs roamed free off their leads on a path.

After the attack, Ebony died in intensive care at a vet's from her horrific injuries, which included a severed wind pipe and cuts and bruising.

Millie, who is a rescue dog, suffered severe puncture wounds to the neck, back and abdomen - but is battling for her life at home.

Assistant practitioner Miss Forman, who wants the dogs responsible for the attack put down, said: ‘It was a completely unprovoked attack - my dogs have never hurt anyone.

‘The owner wasn’t even watching and the dogs were wandering around without a lead on when they saw Ebony and Millie. They launched themselves at my dogs who are tiny in comparison and had no chance.

‘Ebony is a real fighter but her injuries were horrific and she died in the intensive care unit a day after the attack. Millie is really struggling at the moment but I desperately hope she can pull through.’

'As a mother I’m absolutely petrified because if these dogs aren’t put down they could attack someone else. It could be someone else’s dog or even a small child - it’s frightening'

Miss Forman desperately battled to separate Ebony, whom she owned for seven years since she was a pup, and seven-year-old Millie, whom she has owned for 12 months. She also wants the owners prosecuted in court.

Greater Manchester Police revealed it had launched an investigation to find out if the dogs were ‘dangerously out of control’.

Miss Forman, who lives in a £200,000 semi-detached house, said: ‘The police took details from me and the dog owner after the attack.

‘People with vicious dogs should be made to keep them on a lead at all times and forced to make them wear a muzzle.

‘This awful attack cost my beautiful Ebony her life and it would be horrendous if the dogs were left to roam free and hurt or even kill someone else.’

A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: ‘We are ascertaining whether the dogs that carried out the attack were dangerously out of control.’
