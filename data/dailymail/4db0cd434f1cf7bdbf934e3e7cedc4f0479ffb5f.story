A 68-year-old grandmother and three teenagers have died following a fatal car crash on a notorious stretch of mountain road in the Brecon Beacons.

Five teenage boys, all aged 17 and 18, from the Barry area, have  been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving in relation to the incident on Friday night and remain in custody.

Last night police named the dead woman as Margaret Elizabeth Challis, a grandmother from Merthyr Tydfil.

The three teenagers who died have been named locally as Alesha O’Connor, Rhodri Miller and Corey Price, all aged 17, from Barry. 

Another three teenagers are in a serious condition in hospital following the head-on collision between two cars at an accident blackspot.

Police said a convoy of five cars was travelling on the notorious A470 road, which runs through the Brecon Beacons in south Wales, when the accident occurred.

A green VW Golf collided with a black VW Golf Estate between the Storey Arms beauty spot and the village of Libanus at 10.15pm on Friday.

Hundreds of people have taken to social media to pay tribute to the crash victims.

Two of the teenagers were students at Ysgol Gyfun Bro Morgannwg in Barry while the third was a former pupil. 

Dylan Jones, head teacher at Ysgol Bro Morgannwg in Barry, said one of those killed was a sixth form student.

He added: 'A former pupil, a boy, has also died and a third pupil is seriously injured in hospital.

'We had a junior eisteddfod this morning and some of the sixth form were stewarding the event when news started to come in.'

'I have spoken to parents of the those involved and we are preparing for Monday so that we can offer all assistance and counselling to the pupils.'

Police said the five vehicles were racing through a notorious stretch of road in the Brecon Beacons (pictured)

A statement on the school's website says: 'Following a car accident we received some sad news about our pupils.

'Our thoughts and sympathies are with their families and we wish a speedy recovery to all those who have also been injured in the incident.' 

A Dyfed-Powys Police spokesman said: 'It is believed that a number of vehicles were travelling in convoy at the time of the collision.

'The black Golf is not believed to be part of the convoy of vehicles.

'Five male drivers, from other vehicles in the convoy have been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and remain in police custody.

A single bunch of purple irises was tied to a barbed wire fence at the scene of the crash today. 

Hundreds of people have taken to social media to pay tribute to the four people who died.

One wrote: 'RIP rhodri, alesha & corey, always in our hearts! Never forgotten.'

Another said: 'So devastated. 4 people snatched away just like that. rest in peace to you all.'

One wrote about Alesha: 'My beautiful girl, I'll love you always, I'll remember you forever. Couldn't of ever had a better best friend.' 

The mountain pass road reaches 1600ft as it goes through Storey Arms, the main access point for the climb to Penyfan, the highest mountain in the Brecon Beacons.

It is a known accident blackspot - there are two roadside shrines less than a mile away from the scene of the latest crash.

Local businessman Jason Griffiths, 47, said: 'It is another tragedy - there are always flowers laid on the roadside. Now there will be more.

'I use this road most days, it is dangerous especially at night.

'There are always flowers alongside it where people have been killed. It is a mountain pass which snakes for about a mile before opening up onto a fast stretch of road.'

Eyewitness Nigel Shiel said paramedics and fire crews were on the scene 'within minutes' and the drivers in the convoy didn't believe anyone had died initially.

He said: 'I came upon the accident just after the ambulance got there. I spoke with some of the lads in the cars not involved in crash, they were all from Barry.

'At the time of speaking to them they believed that all their friends were still alive as we had seen one of them being pulled from the cars.

'It was a terrible scene.' 

A spokeswoman for the Welsh ambulance service said there were an 'enormous amount of resources on the scene' and believed the incident was a 'head on collision'.

She said: 'A rapid response unit conveyed patients into Prince Charles Hospital. in Merthyr Tydfil.

'An emergency ambulance conveyed a patient to University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.'

Officers are appealing for any witnesses to the incident to get in touch with the Dyfed Powys Roads Policing Unit by calling 101.
