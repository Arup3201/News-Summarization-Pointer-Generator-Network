The staff of The View were in shock when they heard that Rosie Perez has been cut from the show.

And no one more so than Rosie O'Donnell, who doesn't believe it! She went on a tirade denying the news Variety broke last night that Perez would not be returning to the show after her hiatus to rehease for a Broadway show is over.

'No matter what you read anywhere, Rosie Perez is also coming back after she is done rehearsing her play…regardless of what you hear in other shows or read in magazines as I did last night at 11:40/

'What the BLEEP," Rosie said as she was cut off from uttering was was sure to be the f-word.hBut sources confirm to Daily Mail Online that Perez is a goner. 

'Everyone is in a panic here and something had to be done,' a network insider told Daily Mail Online. 'The executive producer had to make a serious change to breath new life into the show. Perez was the "to go."'

The news comes just days after Daily Mail Online exclusively reported that the long-running talk show could end after this season, amid struggling ratings and infighting among the talk show hosts. a show spokesperson has denied such a possibility.

Rosie O had a major melt down behind the scenes over the report that the show may be canceled.

Bye Bye Rose P:  Rosie Perez wasn't cutting it on The View. She even tangled with pal Rosie O'Donnell. Now she's been cut from the show

Saving the day: ABC execs have brought back the show's creator Barbara Walters to guest co-host on Fridays for the month of January to bring some 'familiarity back to the show'

 Currently in its eighteenth season, The View, created by retired TV journalist Barbara Walters is suffering some of its lowest ratings ever with Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie O'Donnell, Nicolle Wallace and Rosie Perez.

Now under the umbrella of ABC News, the network is considering the possibility of ending the show and replacing it with an extended version of 'Good Morning America.'

The View has a history of denying reports that hosts were leaving the show - only to be proven wrong.

A year ago, Barbara Walters denied that Elisabeth Hasselbeck was leaving. She did. Jenny McCarthy insisted she wasn't leaving the show...and she did. 

Since the rating-challenged daytime talk show returned from its winter hiatus on January 5, host Rosie O'Donnell – who has been moderating while Whoopi Goldberg has been nursing a back injury – has reminded the audience that Perez was out for the entire month of January rehearsing for the Broadway play Fish in the Dark with Larry David.

The show has used several guest co-hosts, including The View favorite, comedian Mario Cantone, to fill in for Perez. They even brought back the show's creator Barbara Walters to guest co-host on Fridays for the month of January to bring some 'familiarity back to the show,' as an insider explained to Daily Mail Online.

But ABC News has been pressuring the show's executive producer to make some changes to the show, with its lackluster ratings. The show's direct competition, The Talk, is narrowing in on the gap and is close to overtaking it; and freshman talker The Real continues to crush the show in the key demographic age of 18 to 34-year-olds.

The 50-year-old Perez was a last minute addition to The View lineup. As first reported last July by Daily Mail Online, new co-host Nicolle Wallace and former reality show October Gonzalez had landed the spots once occupied by Sherri Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy.

Favorite: The show has used several guest co-hosts, including The View favorite, comedian Mario Cantone, to fill in for Rosie Perez during her rehearsals for her stint on Broadway. Mario was also a Sex and the City fave

'But once the producers started doing test shows and chemistry tests, they realized October just wasn't going to cut it. Good looks and girl-next-door charm alone wasn't going to carry her at the Hot Topics table,' explained the insider.

Perez confessed during an appearance on the Wendy Williams Show last fall, that she was a last minute addition to the show. 

'They approached me two weeks before and I only had a day to decide,' she told Williams. The actress and former choreographer was friends with O'Donnell prior to working together on the show, but the two fell out after a debate about Bill Cosby's rape allegations caused tension with them behind the scenes.

Perez had a major melt down after a hostile, gum-chewing O'Donnell treated her with disdain during an on-air segment discussing the rape allegations against Bill Cosby.

Perez had argued that Cosby has been pilloried by social media and that there is no way to prove that the allegations are true. Perez attempted to defend her opinion to O'Donnell but O'Donnell wasn't having it. 

The actress also became difficult to work with, having gone through six makeup artists, two assistants, and several hair stylists before deciding to do her own hair most days.

As indicated by Variety, she also struggled with the variety of subjects the show did for Hot Topics and never got the hang of using the teleprompter.

Sweet substitutes: ABC is interested in wooing younger co-hosts to fill Perez's seat as well as the fifth seat never filled.  Glee star Naya Rivera, 28 and  Destiny's Child singer Michelle Williams, 34, are being considered

ABC is very interested in wooing younger co-hosts to fill Perez's seat and the fifth seat that was never filled in it's attempt to save the show.

The front runner now is former Destiny's Child singer Michelle Williams, 34, who came in for a single guest hosting position on January 7 and was so impressive executives brought her back for an unplanned follow-up appearance days later. 

'She's smart, witty, has A-List celebrity relationships that can benefit the show and isn't afraid to sell a segment. She let O'Donnell pop a pimple on her chin on live TV during her first appearance,' said the insider.

ABC News is also still interested in Glee star Naya Rivera, 28. Of the guest hosts, the actress has been invited back the most to fill-in and she doesn't mind a good argument on a topic.

'She confessed that she only showers once every three days and social media went crazy. That's the type of person they think will help the show pop again,' said the source.

There will be additional younger co-hosts in throughout the month of January and ABC News is also trying to get some former co-hosts to come back and fill-in to bring back some of the audience. 

Overall ratings are down 34 percent, according to sources,  and they hope to gain viewers back. 

Joy Behar was supposed to guest host on Monday and Tuesday of this week, but came down with the flu and Cantone sat in her in place.
