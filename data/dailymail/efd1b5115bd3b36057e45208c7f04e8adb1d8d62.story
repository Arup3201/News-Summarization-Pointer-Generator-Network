New role: Downing Street yesterday confirmed that Philip Hammond will replace William Hague at the Foreign Office

David Cameron risked moving Britain closer to the EU exit door last night – by appointing a man dubbed ‘the most Eurosceptic Foreign Secretary since Viscount Halifax declared war in 1939’.

Downing Street yesterday confirmed that Philip Hammond will replace William Hague at the Foreign Office following the latter’s dramatic decision to step down on Monday night.

Mr Hammond, 58, is one of the few senior Tories to publicly state he would vote to leave the European Union unless it reforms. Other prominent Eurosceptics receiving promotions included Mr Hammond’s  successor as Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon, and new Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss.

The appointment of Mr Hammond, who is close to Home Secretary Theresa May, will also make him a major player in the eventual contest to replace Mr Cameron as Tory leader.

But the main focus yesterday was on what the appointment signals about Mr Cameron’s approach to negotiations with Brussels ahead of a promised in/out referendum on Europe in 2017. Mats Persson, director of the respected Open Europe think-tank, said the Cabinet had ‘clearly taken a more Eurosceptic turn’, adding that Mr Hammond ‘undoubtedly has a higher threshold than William Hague’ for what would be a good deal for Britain.

Mr Persson said: ‘Having a figure who has said that reform must be substantial for him to back an “in” will add credibility to their election campaign and help win back voters who have left to vote for Ukip.

‘It’s fair to say Mr Hammond is the most Eurosceptic Tory Foreign Secretary since Viscount Halifax declared war in 1939.’

Former Tory minister Tim Loughton welcomed the appointment: ‘He’s clearly much more of an overt Eurosceptic and the whole story post-the-2015-election is going to be about renegotiation with Europe ahead  of a referendum.

Same policy: William Hague rejected the theory that naming Mr Hammond as his successor marked a more Eurosceptic approach from the Tories

‘William
 has done a fantastic job, one of the best Foreign Secretaries, but has 
not been as outspoken on Euroscepticism as many perhaps would like him 
to be.’

But Mr Hague rejected the theory that naming Mr Hammond as his successor marked a more Eurosceptic approach from the Tories.

He said: ‘We are very clear and united on Europe. Philip Hammond, David Cameron and I all have exactly the same policy on Europe.

‘We want to improve Britain’s relationship with the EU and then hold a referendum on staying in or leaving the European Union.’

Last year Mr Hammond said he would vote to leave the EU ‘if the choice is between a European Union written exactly as it is today and not being a part of that’.

But yesterday he attempted to play down his doubts about Brussels, saying he believes Britain can achieve an acceptable deal from the EU. Mr Hammond said: ‘I’m going to focus on making sure that we get a successful renegotiation with our European partners. I don’t think the way to enter a negotiation is to start issuing threats. The way to enter a negotiation is to look for the areas where we do agree.

‘There are many issues where Britain is not isolated, where there are other members of the European Union that also understand the need for reform and particularly understand the need for reform to allow the Eurozone and the non-Eurozone part of Europe to be able to work together.

‘I believe it will be possible to renegotiate significant change to the way the European Union works.’

Mr Hammond is seen by the Prime Minister as a safe pair of hands and was instrumental in tackling the disastrous finances of the Ministry of Defence. But his cheese-paring approach was unpopular with some members of the military top brass.

Mr Hammond will be plunged immediately into a series of international crises, including the bloody civil wars in Iraq and Syria, the renewed fighting in Israel and  the continuing Russian threats against Ukraine.
