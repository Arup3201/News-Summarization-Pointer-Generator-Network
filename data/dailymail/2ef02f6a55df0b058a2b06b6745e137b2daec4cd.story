David de Gea was named Manchester United's player of the year by both his team-mates and supporters at the club's annual awards ceremony on Thursday night.

The Spanish goalkeeper did the double as he received the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award, voted for by the supporters, and the Players' Player of the Year prize for his impressive form this season.

De Gea picked up the supporters' award after claiming 54 per cent of the vote, ahead of Wayne Rooney and Adnan Januzaj in second and third place respectively.

season to do our best again.'

'Sometimes 
it's important for your team-mates to give you confidence and I think 
they're some of the best team-mates you can have.

'I
 tried to do my best this year and I think it was my best season so far.
 I felt really good and confident. I will try to do the same for next 
season.'

Wayne Rooney was awarded the Goal of the Season award for his 60-yard wonder-strike against West Ham at Upton Park in March.

The
 stunning effort, which brought back memories of David Beckham's 
long-range effort against Wimbledon in 1996, polled 58 per cent of the 
vote to beat Patrica Evra's goal at Bayern Munich.

Rooney
 said: 'It was a goal that I am really pleased with, I do think David 
Beckham's was a bit better, but I was happy to score.

'I did worry that it might bounce over the goalkeeper at first, but you just have to hope for the best. Thankfully it came off.'

Interim manager Ryan Giggs was recognised for his services to the club with the Lifetime Achievement award.

Giggs
 said: 'I’m not usually an emotional person. But this has touched me. To
 receive this Lifetime Achievement is something special, one of the most
 special awards I’ve ever received.

'This
 club touches everyone’s heart; it’s not only a club, it’s a family. So 
many special people have been a part of that, so for me to win this is 
emotional and it’s a special night for me.

'I’ve
 played with so many great players who have had a massive impact on me, 
and of course Sir Alex Ferguson, who has been the single biggest 
influence on my career. I’m a lucky man.'

The 18-year-old said: 'I'm very proud. I didn’t expect something like this.

'I’ve
 settled in pretty well because Manchester United is like a family, so I
 made friends really quickly. Warren Joyce [the United reserves coach] 
had confidence in me and gave me a chance to prove myself.'
