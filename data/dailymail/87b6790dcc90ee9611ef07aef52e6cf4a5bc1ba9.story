Basketball great Kobe Bryant took to social media in the hours after suffering his most serious injury amid fears that his legendary career could be over.

He posted pictures on Instagram of him in the hospital as he prepared for surgery on his ruptured Achilles tendon, which was injured during Friday night's win over the Golden State Warriors.

'Surgery prep time. Lookin like Mrs Doubtfire with a jerri curl cap lol Anesthesia next #highasakite #mambaout,' he posted Saturday afternoon.

Some even wonder whether this was the injury that could be the end to his extraordinary career.

Bryant's pictures show him smiling and giving the peace sign - a stark contrast to his mood immediately following injuring his ankle.

Bryant called it the most disappointing injury of his career 'by far.'

Moments after he went down, Bryant vowed to get back up.

'I
know I can do this,' said Bryant, who's averaging 27.3 points, 5.6 
rebounds and 6.0 assists. 'It's fueling me. It's fueling me. I can feel 
it already.'

Still 
wearing his gold game uniform, Bryant solemnly took questions while 
thinking about the upcoming final days of the Lakers' tumultuous season.

Later, he went on Facebook to post a rant where the normally stoic athlete showed a rare display of vulnerability and doubt.

'All the training and sacrifice flew out the window with one step I've done a million times,' the five-time NBA champion wrote.

'Makes no damn sense. Now I'm supposed to come back from this and be the same player or better at age 35?!?

'How in the world am I supposed to do that?

'Maybe this is how my book ends. Maybe Father Time has defeated me.'

But he then added, 'Then again maybe not!

'One day, the beginning of a new career journey will commence. Today is NOT that day,' he vowed.

Bryant, in his 17th NBA season, felt a pop as he pushed off his left foot during the game. The pain made him think somebody kicked him, causing him to tumble to the floor.

'I made a move that I've made a 
million times, and it just popped,' he said while appearing to bite back
tears as he leaned on crutches in the Lakers' locker room after a 
118-116 win over Golden State.

The
fourth-leading scorer in NBA history probably will miss the postseason 
for just the second time, even if Los Angeles hangs on to the eighth 
spot in the Western Conference playoff race without him.

The
34-year-old who has spent half his life in a Lakers uniform realizes 
everybody will wonder if his career will ever be the same.

Game time: Bryant, a five-time NBA champion seen center before his injury on Friday, has played more than 38 minutes per game, more than any teammate and more than any player in the league over 30

After a terrible start and numerous missteps along the way, Los Angeles (42-37) is one game ahead of the Utah Jazz, who hold the tiebreaker, for the final playoff spot in the West with two games to play.

Asked how he was immediately feeling, he said both angry and sad.

'We worked so hard to put ourselves in position and control our fate,' he said. 'I certainly have done a lot of work to prepare myself. It's just bad luck.'

Bryant, who scored 34 points despite hyperextending his left knee early in the second half, hit two free throws after apparently tearing his tendon with 3:08 to play, tying the game before hobbling to the locker room.

His teammates then rallied past the wilting Warriors, with Pau Gasol and Dwight Howard getting big baskets down the stretch before Steve Blake's go-ahead free throws in the final minutes.

The win kept the Lakers in control of their playoff destiny, still in the running for the franchise's 16th postseason trip during Bryant's career, they'll probably have to do it without the five-time NBA champion in uniform, assuming an MRI on Saturday confirms the Lakers' diagnosis of a torn tendon.

'I'm going to be there still,' Bryant said. 'I can't be with them out there on the floor, but I can use my intellect to try to break down film and help them see things they might not see.'

But after playing heavy minutes all season while fighting several minor injuries, one of the most durable stars in NBA history finally incurred an injury even he couldn't play through.

'I can't walk,' he said, with only a trace of a smirk. 'I tried to maybe just put pressure on my heel, see if I could do it that way, but there was just nothing there.'

Achilles' tendon injuries can require many months of rehabilitation and recovery, depending on their severity, and the 34-year-old Bryant has enormous mileage on his legs. The NBA's No. 3 scorer this season has played more than 38 minutes per game, more than any teammate and more than any player in the league over 30.

Emotional: Kobe appeared quite emotional while describing himself in a press conference after as both angry and sad

Determined: Bryant tweeted this message early Saturday morning expressing his determination to recover, while jokingly noting his alleged use of the painkiller, Vicodin

While others' thoughts immediately went past the Lakers' immediate future to Bryant's career, he swiftly shot down any notion he might be finished. Bryant was already thinking about rehabilitation from an injury that typically requires several months of recovery.

'I've never had to deal with something like this,' he said. 'It is a new experience for me. Obviously, there have been a bunch of players that have had the same injury. All I can do is look at them, see what they've done, and see who had more success coming back quicker and healthier. See what they did, and try to improve on that.'

Bryant said his teammates must 'just continue to play. We've been dealing with injuries all year. I'll do what I can, watching film and communicating to the guys the best form of attacking certain teams, and go from there.'

The Lakers' future is tied up in Bryant's health even beyond his vaunted scoring and leadership: He will make nearly $30.5 million next season in the final year of his deal. Los Angeles' uncertain offseason just got even weirder, with Howard's impending unrestricted free agency still looming largest in the mix.

Bryant has been ferociously competitive while trying to keep the Lakers' playoff hopes afloat. While Gasol and Steve Nash have missed long stretches of play with injuries, and while Howard struggled to get to full strength after last year's back surgery, Bryant played through a sprained ankle and countless minor woes, missing only two games with injuries that could sideline other players for weeks.

After playing all 48 minutes while scoring 47 points in Portland on Wednesday, Bryant pushed the Lakers relentlessly forward on one good leg against the playoff-bound Warriors. Golden State got 47 points from Stephen Curry in a dynamic performance, but Bryant led a 9-0 run by hitting consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 107 with 3:47 left.

'I hate it for Kobe,' said first-year Lakers coach Mike D'Antoni, who has marveled at Bryant's toughness while discounting suggestions Bryant was playing too much. 'I hate it for us. I hate it for L.A., but you have to close ranks. There's no going back now. ... He's just an unbelievable player with a heart, and it is unbelievable.'

Bryant didn't know whether his heavy workload contributed to the injury.

'Who knows? It was all necessary,' he said. 'It's just a freak situation, I guess.'

Bryant's teammates had little to say to him in the locker room, many still in disbelief over the latest injury woe to befall this high-priced roster.

'He's the greatest competitor, and he's been that all season long, all through his career,' said Gasol, who had 26 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in his sixth career triple-double. 'He's been an example for us throughout all this. He showed character. He showed heart, and that's what we're going to need from now on.'
