A striking black-and-white catalogue of images which document London's political and counter-culture graffiti scene in the 1970s is being republished for the first time in almost 40 years.

The images, boasting complex slogans from 'Strike a body blow to capitalism' to 'The tigers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction', were part of the early work of acclaimed photographer Roger Perry but were last published in 1976.

Lovers of art and underground culture have now succeeded in their bid to republish the collection, The Writing on The Wall, after raising more than £10,000 via the crowd-funding website Kickstarter.

Body blow to capitalism: Striking photos of London's political graffiti which were taken in the 1970s including at King's Cross station (pictured) are being re-released after almost 40 years. They were part of the collection The Writing On The Wall by Roger Perry

Do not submit: This image in Clapton, north London, sends a statement in an era which saw tension between people and those in power

What does it mean? The new edition of The Writing On The Wall, which was last published in 1976 and is now hard to obtain, will include a new foreword and expand on some of the stories and messages behind the often cryptic messages - such as this one in Notting Hill

While taking the photos Mr Perry was the chief photographer for Time Out magazine, which he later left to work for The Sunday Times and The Observer colour magazines, where he helped document the emerging punk movement.

The book is thought to have been the first completely dedicated to London graffiti, and tells the story of the capital's counter-culture and underground press through the poetic - and sometimes surreal - statements daubed on  houses and iron fences.

Most of the graffiti in the book could be described as ‘Pre-Renaissance’, according to the fundraising campaign's founder George Stewart-Lockhart - as it was created before it was considered an art form in the eyes of many.

While many of the slogans are political, there are also some which are irreverent and hard to decipher - from 'Beware the thunderous trowel surgeons' to 'Clapton is God'.

Nowadays there is a wide gulf in styles of graffiti and how much they count as art. Scrawled tags cost the British Transport Police alone more than £3.5million a year to remove, and are a headache for authorities and residents alike.

Fighting the power: This slogan was daubed on a wall in Ladbroke Grove, West London. Police complain that much graffiti nowadays is mindless 'tagging' which costs millions of pounds a year to clean up - though political slogans have certainly not died away

Meaningless? The messages raised the deeper questions about life, such as this one in Chalk Farm, near Camden, in around 1975

Eat the rich: A woman walks past this slogan on a bridge - where there is also support for London football club Queens Park Rangers

But Scotland's Chief Constable Sir Stephen House recently claimed 'tagging' has declined - because social media has offered disaffected people a new platform to vent ideas which a decade ago 'would have been sprayed on the side of a building'.

Political graffiti has not gone out of fashion either. In protests against the rise in tuition fees in 2010, students defaced London monuments including Nelson's Column and the statue of Winston Churchill with messages including 'Education for the masses' and '**** the police'.

But many political slogans have now been worked into visual metaphors. The anonymous artist Banksy's satirical take on Ukip's rise in Clacton, Essex - which featured pigeons with placards reading 'Go Back to Africa' - fell foul of council officials who scrubbed it off after a complaint deemed it racist.

Other modern graffiti artists, meanwhile, create complicated murals - often with the permission of a building's owner. A 300-metre tunnel  under London's Waterloo Station is nicknamed the 'graffiti tunnel' and attracts tourists and lovers of urban art, with similar walls in cities across Britain.

Simple message: This slogan in Kentish Town, north London, appealed to a now-unknown cause. George Stewart-Lockhart, 21, who arranged a campaign to bring the book back into print, said: 'I ended up realising the incredible stories and people behind the pieces'

Paperwork: This slogan in Notting Hill called on the state and fellow dwellers of counter-culture to do away with bureaucracy

Counter-protest: It seems not everyone was so happy with the array of political daubings adorning the capital's walls

Mr Stewart-Lockhart, 21, said: 'My friend and artist, Graham ‘Paris’ Dews, posted one of the images from the book on his Instagram.

'After fruitlessly trying to find a copy for less than £60 on the internet, I thought the best course of action would be to republish it.'

He set out on a mission to have the book republished and managed to track down Mr Perry’s widow, Kate Bindloss.

'She seemed so thrilled at the idea,' said Mr Stewart-Lockhart. 'The more I researched, the more wonderful people I ended up meeting. From initially viewing it from the angle of a purely aesthetic graffiti book, I ended up realising the incredible stories and people behind the pieces.

'Some pretty unlikely names turned up along the way too.'

George Melly, the late jazz singer, wrote the original introduction for The Writing On The Wall and in the new edition it will be supplemented with a piece by artist and writer Bill Drummond, and an extensive foreword by Mr Stewart-Lockhart.

The book will go further than the original, outlining the stories behind the works and explaining their often cryptic sentiments, using exclusive first hand interviews with the people who painted the ‘anonymous’ statements.

Mr Perry was based in London for the majority of his career, studying at Harrow School of Art before joining Time Out.

Irreverent: Not all of the works by Roger Perry were political. This slogan was daubed on corrugated metal in Highbury, north London

Philisophical: Not much graffiti these days refers to radical 1920s art movements. This piece in Kentish Town, north London, did just that

Trowel surgeons: A non-political slogan adorns a wall in Ladbroke Grove, west London, in 1975. Much political and humorous graffiti has now moved into visual metaphors such as those created by the anonymous Banksy, while police are left to deal with simpler tags

Celebrity culture: Royal gossip (none of it true) infiltrated this piece of graffiti on a wall in Notting Hill, west London, in 1975

Not for dogs: A pet stands before another surreal slogan in Richmond, south west London, in 1976. The collection of black-and-white images is being re-released after almost 40 years after a crowd-funding campaign by a 21-year-old art-lover raised more than £10,000

Acclaimed: Roger Perry (pictured) took the photos while working for Time Out before he moved to The Sunday Times and the Observer

He was responsible for a number of iconic covers as well as music and fringe theatre photography.

The Writing On The Wall was initially published in 1976 before Roger moved on to work for The Sunday Times and The Observer colour magazines, where he was instrumental in his documentation of the early punk movement.

A number of his portraits are now in the permanent collection of the National Portrait Gallery, but his photography dwindled after he developing severe rheumatoid arthritis.

In the mid 1980s, he moved to Suffolk and put his energy into restoring classic Lancia cars until his death in 1991.

The book is being released exclusively via Kickstarter and has already reached its target. More information can be found here.
