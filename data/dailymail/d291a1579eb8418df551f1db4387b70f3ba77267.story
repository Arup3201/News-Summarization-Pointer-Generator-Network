A Harvard law professor who was named alongside Prince Andrew in his 'sex slave' case has insisted he has never even met his accuser.

Alan Dershowitz, who was part of O.J. Simpson's 'dream team', was named in court documents by a woman who says she was forced to have sex with friends of U.S. billionaire and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, including Prince Andrew.

The woman, identified as Virginia Roberts, was just 17 at the time, making her a minor.

But on Monday, Alan Dershowitz appeared on the Today show to speak out against the claims, which have resurfaced in a civil suit against the U.S. government for how it handled Epstein's case.

Speaking from Miami, Dershowitz insisted the woman's claims against him are 'totally false and made up' and he is 'completely and absolutely' innocent.

Anger: Prominent attorney Alan Dershowitz spoke out on the Today show on Monday morning to deny claims he had sex with an underage girl, as she has claimed in a civil lawsuit

'I don't even know who she is,' he said of the woman. 'I've never seen her. I've never met her. I don't know who she is.'

He pointed out that the woman claims they had sex on Epstein's Caribbean Island and at his New Mexico ranch, but Dershowitz said he had only ever been there briefly with his wife and daughter.

'I was never out of the sight of my wife,' he said.

He added that the woman has also accused him of having sex with her while they were on Epstein's planes, but he called upon her lawyers to check the manifests of the journeys - because he was never on the flights, he said.

Dershowitz then turned on the woman's lawyers, Paul Cassell and Brad Edwards, accusing them of failing to properly investigate her claims.

'If they had checked my travel records, if they had asked me and I could have given them the names of people who were witnesses - they would know the story is totally untrue,' he said.

'It's the legal equivalent of scribbling something on a toilet stall and then running away.' 

Dershowitz called for the two men to be disbarred for their 'unethical' practice.

'They will rue the day they filed this,' he said. 'They will not get away with this. There will be legal proceedings. The truth will come out and... these two unethical attorneys will be disbarred.'

Mr Cassell told DailyMail.com that he and Mr Edwards would not be responding to 'specific claims of indignation by anyone'. 

'We have been informed of Mr Dershowitz's threats based on the factual allegations we have made in our recent filing,' he said in a statement. 

'We carefully investigate all of the allegations in our pleadings before presenting them. We have also tried to depose Mr Dershowitz on these subjects, although he has avoided those deposition requests.

'Nevertheless, we would be pleased to consider any sworn testimony and documentary evidence Mr Dershowitz would like to provide which he contends would refute any of our allegations.'

He added that attorney Jack Scarola, who is handling related litigation, has invited Dershowitz to provide sworn testimony and any evidence - including his passport travel pages and photographs of him at Epstein's properties - relating to his part in the suit by January 19.

Cassell added: 'We intend only to litigate the relevant issues in Court and not to play into any sideshow. We feel that is in our clients' best interest and consequently that is what we are doing.' 

Also on Monday, Dershowitz's wife of 30 years, Carolyn, came to his defense and denied that they had ever met Roberts.

'Anyone that knows us would find it laughable if it weren't so serious,' she told Inside Edition. 'He is the least likely person in the entire world that this would be true of.'

She said that they had been to Epstein's island  - but had no recollection of meeting the girl.

'She's totally unfamiliar to me,' she said. 'I was on that island with Alan. Our daughter was there. Our friends met us for dinner. We were together the whole time.' 

Speaking to the Today show, Dershowitz added that he would welcome a full investigation into the woman's claims so that people see he had no part in it.

'I'm not trying to silence her,' he said. 'I challenged her to repeat the statement to the press so I can sue for her defamation... She has studiously refused to.'

In an interview with BBC Radio 4 over the weekend, he also urged the Duke of York to fight back. 

'You cannot allow these allegations to hang above you,' Dershowitz said in the interview.

'The first question you have to ask yourself when you are charged with a crime like this is, "Is there any conceivable possibility you did it?" and if the answer to that is 'no', you have to fight back with every resource and ounce of energy available to you.'

The prince, who has cut short a vacation to travel back to the U.K., has issued a strongly-worded denial, with Buckingham Palace saying 'any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue'.

The claim by the woman is part of a U.S. civil case she and three other women have made against the government for how it handled the case against Epstein, a former friend of the Duke.

The women claim the government violated victims' rights when it made the plea deal in 2008.

Epstein – who was suspected for decades of paying for sex with dozens of underage girls – was only ever convicted and jailed for 18 months on a single charge of soliciting paid sex with minors.

Her lawyers claim that Prince Andrew had lobbied the government over Epstein's case.

In court documents the woman accuses Epstein, the Prince and his friend the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell - the daughter of crooked tycoon Robert - of abusing her when she was underage. 

She says she was told to 'give the prince whatever he demanded' by Epstein.

The prince stayed friends with him despite his conviction and they were seen together in 2011 after Epstein's release from jail.  

Her father, Sky Roberts, has also spoken out to say that Prince Andrew should be prosecuted if the claims were true. The suit, which is civil not criminal, has been filed against the government and not Prince Andrew so he does not face any penalties.

Over the weekend, police sources in the U.K. said that the Duke of York could face an investigation if Roberts makes a formal complaint against him. 

Mr Roberts, 58, also claimed his daughter had been introduced to the Queen while visiting London with Epstein - but Buckingham Palace has denied the allegations. 

'There is nothing to suggest the claim is true,' a spokesperson said. 'We have no record of such a meeting.'

In a newly-released statement, the alleged victim said she would continue to fight for justice.

'I am looking forward to vindicating my rights as an innocent victim and pursuing all available recourse,' she said.

'It appears that I am now being unjustly victimized again. These types of aggressive attacks on me are exactly the reason why sexual abuse victims typically remain silent and the reason why I did for a long time. That trend should change. I'm not going to be bullied back into silence.'
