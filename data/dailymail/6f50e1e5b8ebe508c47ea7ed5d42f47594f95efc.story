Rexona is a popular with young people abusing aerosols in Alice Springs

One of Australia's top deodorant brands are looking into how they can reduce abuse of their aerosols after they became the favourite product for children as young as 10 to inhale in the Northern Territory.

Shops in Alice Springs have removed Rexona from their shelves and placed it behind the counter, where glue is also safely stored, after it was stolen by children trying to get high.

Rexona met with the Central Australian Youth Link-Up Service recently to discuss what can be done about the intoxicating hydrocarbon fumes from their product, CAYLUS manager Blair McFarland told MailOnline.

The Alice Springs-based youth service saw a sniffing outbreak involving hundreds of young people in the local area over the Easter weekend.

Shops in the Northern Territory town saw their supplies of Rexona depleted and youth workers found almost 200 empty cans of the product on a hill next to the town.

'The town kids showed the bush kids how to sniff and they all headed up to Billy Goat Hill that weekend,' Mr McFarland said.

The majority of the kids involved were just 12-years-old.

Mr McFarland has lived in Alice Springs for 30 years and previously successfully campaigned to have the abusive chemical found in petrol removed in the Northern Territory.

He explained that kids stole the deodorant product from supermarkets and left the cans on the ground.

Alice Springs branches of Woolworths, Coles, Mad Harrys, Eastside, Northside and Flynn Drive supermarkets at first agreed to remove the product from shelves for two weeks and have now extended that promise.

Mr McFarland said 'the majority of sniffers here are aboriginal but that's because 30 per cent of the population here are indigenous'. This is a file photo of children in the outback

'It does bad things to the nervous system. If you inhale it then it melts the fat around your nerves,' he said.

'In Alice Springs it's an ongoing problem... the majority of sniffers here are aboriginal, but that's because 30 per cent of the population here are indigenous.'

The youth worker described how was in a supermarket with co-workers and noticed aerosol abusers wondering the aisles.

'You can smell them from two or three metres off - they stink of Rexona,' he said.

Mr McFarland believes education about the effect of sniffing aerosols does not work.

He says the only thing that can stop the damage being done to children's brains is to remove the supply of the product - just like they removed petrol that could be abused from the Northern Territory.

'In the NT we've pretty much managed to eliminate petrol sniffing,' he said.

There used to be around 500 people sniffing petrol every day in the area. However, he said 'a subset of those 500 have gone on to seek other highs'.

Three young people ended up in hospital from sniffing aerosols in Alice Springs, in April 2013, and Mr McFarland warned of the 'brain damage' the product can cause.

'People seek it out if they have not other forms of drugs,' he explained.

He also blamed a government reduction on youth services in the area for a rise in aerosol abuse.

There is now just one patrol on the streets, Tangentyere Youth Patrol, which usually picks up 70 children a night from the streets and takes them home.  

'The underlying problem is there is nothing for them to do now in Alice Springs.'

The problem of aerosol abuse is not limited to the Northern Territory, Mount Isa in Queensland has also reported trouble.

And it is an issue with drug abusers around the world. Among adolescents, inhalants are the second most widely used class of illicit drugs globally.

More than 2 million children aged 12-17 years report using inhalants at least once in their lifetime.

Despite meeting with Rexona, Mr McFarland said the company was very clear that changing their product to remove hydrocarbon fumes would be a 'difficult' thing to do.

Mr McFarland said Unilver - Rexona's parent company - had also agreed to visit Mount Isa and assess the problem.

A Unilever spokesperson told MailOnline: 'Unilever takes the abuse of aerosols seriously. 

'Whilst new technologies may become available in the future, at present all available research that has been conducted by us and international organisations indicates that there isn’t a viable technical or reformulation solution available that will address the issue. 

'We have been actively engaging with community groups, the police and government agencies on the issue and continue to explore other ways that we can help them to address solvent abuse in high risk areas.

'All of our products are clearly labelled with guidelines detailing how to use aerosols safely and carry warning and caution statements regarding the misuse of the product.'
