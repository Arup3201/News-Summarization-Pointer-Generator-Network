Delta Airlines is in the midst of a PR nightmare after a former college professor who is unable to walk filed a lawsuit claiming that the airline refused to accommodate his disability and forced him to crawl down the aisle of a plane, down a flight of steps and across a tarmac at a Massachusetts airport - twice.

According to the suit, filed on July 23, in U.S. Federal District Court in Hawaii, D. Baraka Kanaan claims that on July 26, 2012, he was scheduled to take a series of Delta flights from his home in Hawaii to Nantucket Island in Massachusetts to attend a conference.

Mr. Kanaan, who suffers partial paralysis of his legs stemming from a car accident in 2000, claims he called a Delta customer service representative several weeks before his scheduled trip to let them know about his disability, and that he would need a lift to get onto the airplane and an aisle chair to get him to his seat.

The representative, he claims, told him it wouldn't be a problem.

Mr. Kanaan's initial flight was canceled due to weather, so he was booked on another flight the following day. When he arrived in Nantucket, he was told by flight attendants that the airline didn't have an aisle chair to get him out of his seat, nor a lift to get him off the plane.

When he asked what he was supposed to do, Mr. Kanaan claims he was told, 'I don't know, but we can't get you off the plane,' according to the complaint, first obtained by the Huffington Post.

Simultaneously, Mr. Kanaan claims, he could see a lift available at an adjacent gate.Â 

Mr. Kanaan, while wearing his 'best suit,' was then forced to crawl 'hand-over-hand' down the aisle, down a flight of stairs and across the tarmac to his wheelchair - without any assistance from the crew -as other passengers watched.

The incident, he claims, caused 'great physical and emotional suffering.'

Before heading home to Hawaii, Mr. Kanaan called Delta to report the incident, and to make sure the equipment would be available for his return flight in an attempt to avoid another humiliating ordeal.

When Mr. Kanaan got to the airport, though, he says a flight attendant told him the chair and lift were again unavailable. The flight attendant then offered to put a piece of cardboard on the ground so Mr. Kanaan's clothes wouldn't get dirty as he crawled across the ground, he claims in the suit.

Once he returned home, Mr. Kanaan says Delta offered him 25,000 'sky miles' and a $100 voucher. He refused the offer, however, in fear that any future flights might again have him crawling on his hands and knees.

For any airplane with a seating capacity of 31 or more passengers, the Air Carrier Access Act requires airlines and airports to 'provide boarding assistance to individuals with disabilities by using ramps, mechanical lifts, or other suitable devices where level-entry boarding by loading bridge or mobile lounge is not available.'

The capacity of the plane Mr. Kanaan was in is unclear.

A similar incident happened in 2008, when a woman with muscular dystrophy was forced to crawl off of two separate Delta flights.

Delta has not commented publicly on the suit, and has not filed a response as of Friday, according to online court records.

Mr. Kanaan is seeking compensatory and punitive damages to be determined at trial.
