A Guantanamo Bay prisoner who was captured with al Qaeda fighters in 2001 will be released after being deemed severely mentally ill.

US District Judge Royce Lamberth issued a release order on Friday for Ibrahim Idris, a native of Sudan who has been held as an enemy combatant but not formally charged.

He has spent much of his time at a psychiatric ward on the US naval base since he arrived more than 11 years ago.

Schizophrenic: Ibrahim Idris, from Sudan, suffers from severe mental illness and does not pose a security threat, according to his lawyers

Prisoner: Idris has been a prisoner at Guantanamo Bay, the US Naval Base in Cuba, for 11 years

Top security: Detainees sit in a holding area under the watchful eyes of military police at Guantanamo Bay where Idris was held as an enemy combatant but not formally charged

The decision came after the laywers for the US Department of Justice filed court papers on Wednesday indicating the government would no longer oppose his release. 

The filing did not specifically say why the government decided to drop its objection.

Idris' lawyers had repeatedly argued his illness was so severe he could not pose a security threat.

US officials say Idris, who is in his 50s, was captured with al Qaeda fighters in 2001 by Pakistani forces while attempting to cross the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.

Shortly after he arrived in Guantanamo in 2002, a US army psychiatrist diagnosed him as mentally ill and said Idris suffered from schizophrenia that made it difficult for him to work with his lawyers.
