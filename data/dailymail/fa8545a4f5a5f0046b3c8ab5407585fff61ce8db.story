It's usually cats being coaxed down from trees.

But famed panda cub Bao Bao  is currently sky-high in the branches at the National Zoo in Washington D.C. after being spooked by an electric safety fence in her enclosure.

Apparently the one-year-old touched the charged barrier on Tuesday afternoon and the shock caused her to shoot above ground to safety.

Stuck: Famed panda cub Bao Bao is currently sky-high in the branches at the National Zoo in Washington D.C. after being spooked by an electric safety fence in her enclosure

She chose to stay overnight in her twiggy nest and live video footage shows her stuck in the same spot.

Zoo keepers said that her behavior is 'predictable' and despite the scare, she is 'perfectly fine.' 

'She is still learning the boundaries of her habitat,' they added. 

It is hoped that she will come down from her retreat for Christmas to join her mother, Mei Xiang.

The National Zoo is one of only four zoos nationwide to have pandas, which are on loan from China. 

The zoo's first pair of pandas, Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, were a gift from China following President Richard Nixon's historic 1972 visit to the country. 

The pair had five cubs while living at the zoo but none survived.

The zoo's current adult pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, arrived in 2000.

They welcomed a male cub named Tai Shan in 2005 but he was returned to China five years later for breeding.

Their second infant Bao Bao - whose name means 'precious' or 'treasure' - was born August 23, 2013.

Panda keeper Nicole MacCorkle says Bao Bao has been a different baby from her brother, including a little more stand-offish with keepers.

In the past year she has grown from a wriggling pink newborn, a little bigger than a stick of butter, to a 44lb black-and-white bundle.

Her favorite activities include sleeping, exploring and munching on treats such as sweet potato and bamboo.
