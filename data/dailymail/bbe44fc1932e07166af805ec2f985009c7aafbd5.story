Arsene Wenger accused his Arsenal team of failing to perform as they slumped in Dortmund and returned home with Jack Wilshere at the centre of another injury scare.

Wilshere twisted his right ankle near the end of the 2-0 defeat and Wenger admitted he was concerned because it is the same joint which ruled him out of action for 17 months.

'It's difficult to say how bad it is,' said the Arsenal manager. 'Normally it would not be too bad but I am a bit cautious because of his history.'

Arsene Wenger conceded that his side were second best against Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday night

Injuries are piling up on Arsenal and a blow to Wilshere will deepen the gloom after their Champions League campaign got off to a poor start, as they were deservedly beaten by the Germans.

'It was a difficult night,' said Wenger. 'Dortmund were the better team. We had a disappointing performance. It is difficult to go into individual assessment of any player because as a team were not at the required level.

'Still the paradox of the night is that we had very good chances to score first. We were caught on two counter-attacks. For the first, we lost the ball 80 metres from our goal. There were enough people to stop the goal. We were still three-against-one at the back. It's difficult to understand how we conceded the goal.'

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang made it 2-0 early in the second period once again on the counter-attack 

Arsenal were overwhelmed in midfield, conceding two goals in a three-minute period either side of half-time. It could have been many more as Wenger's team were punished by their fast counter-attacking opponents. Ciro Immobile scored the first and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang the second. Aubameyang also hit the bar.

'They were very strong in midfield, stronger than us, I agree,' said Wenger, who also defended Danny Welbeck, his new £16million signing who missed a clear chance to open the scoring.

'He will improve,' said Wenger. 'I don't think we have to make a problem of that. He had a lively first half, two or three good chances; one obvious one. We have to be a bit patient maybe.'

Dortmund unleashed a barrage of 23 shots at Arsenal's goal. Aaron Ramsey apologised to fans on Twitter and captain Mikel Arteta said: 'We faced a top side at one of the toughest stadiums in Europe. They have a lot of pace up front and we gave the ball away too many times. They took the game where they wanted to take it.'

Teenage right-back Hector Bellerin started his first Arsenal game in the absence of injured defenders Mathieu Debuchy and Nacho Monreal and Calum Chambers who had tonsillitis and was an unused substitute.

Borussia Dortmund were also hit by injuries, with many players missing, but the victory puts them in control of Group D. Anderlecht and Galatasaray drew 1-1 in the other game.

'I am very pleased,' said Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp. 'Three players went out of the team because of muscle problems but we made some decisions and I have to say it was a great performance by the team. Really strong.

'We were brave, we were fast and that is everything we needed for this game. We had other chances but two-nil is perfect for us against a strong opponent. I enjoyed it from the first second until the last. To see games like this, it is the best in the world. We play this quickly it's very hard to defend against.'

Arsenal's next test is at home to Galatasaray in a fortnight.
