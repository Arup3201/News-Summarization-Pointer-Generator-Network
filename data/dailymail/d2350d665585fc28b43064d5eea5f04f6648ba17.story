Anni Dewani's family have scrutinised the BBC for their creation of a Panorama programme that undermines the claims of her husband, Shrien Dewani

The family of murdered honeymooner Anni Dewani have accused the BBC of playing ‘judge and jury’ in a documentary that casts doubt on the prosecution case against her husband.

The 28-year-old was kidnapped and shot dead in the back of a taxi while on honeymoon in South Africa with millionaire Shrien Dewani, in November 2010.

Dewani, 33, is accused of paying two local men to kill his wife in a sham car-jacking.

But a Panorama programme, The Honeymoon Murder: Who Killed Anni?, claims to expose holes in the evidence of star prosecution witness Zola Tongo.

The BBC says it has obtained ‘secret police files’ that will ‘expose fundamental mistakes both in the police investigation and the interpretation of forensic evidence’.

Mrs Dewani’s uncle, Ashok Hindocha, said the corporation did not consult the family about the ‘insensitive’ documentary and claims broadcasters had added to their grief.

He said producers failed to seek a right to reply from the family and even reused previous interviews with relatives.

Mr Hindocha has written to BBC director-general Lord Hall to claim the broadcaster had broken its guidelines to ‘minimise possible distress’ to grieving families.

He said: ‘Broadcasters should not be doing a programme before the trial about whether someone is guilty or not guilty.

‘We have a court and a justice system in the world, which should be respected.‘It is not their place to play judge and jury. This battle should be played out in the courts, not in the media.’

Mr Hindocha said the programme was a shameless attempt to ‘play on Anni’s name for publicity and to get viewers’.

He asked how the BBC had obtained a confidential South African police file, containing CCTV tapes and mobile phone records, and questioned the motives of whoever leaked the documents.

He said: ‘I asked them where they got the information, and they said it wasn’t stolen from the police and they didn’t pay for it.

‘So how did these police files get into their hands and whose interest did it serve? They paid forensic experts to appear on the programme, but they don’t have access to the full case files. And who is going to cross-examine the experts?’

Last night it emerged that the programme had also obtained medical records that apparently suggested the couple were trying for a family.

The evidence could contradict police claims that Dewani was secretly gay and ordered his wife’s murder so he could live a homosexual lifestyle.

The programme claims: ‘We can reveal medical records – from just days before the honeymoon – show the couple were actively trying for a baby’, but does not elaborate on what the records showed.

Mr Hindocha said: ‘I don’t think these claims are correct but it is not for the BBC to broadcast material like police files and medical records.

'It is for the courts to examine.’ Referring to the impending documentary, he said: ‘This has been stressful for all of our family. My brother [Anni’s father] is very sad.’

The Panorama programme also says that Mrs Dewani could have been shot ‘by accident’.

Firearms experts say the bullet may have rebounded off her hand and through her chest by accident ‘during a struggle’.

The programme also casts doubt on the claims of taxi driver Zola Tongo, 32, who received a reduced sentence of 18 years in return for his testimony.

Prosecution witness Tongo claimed that Dewani called him on the morning of the murder, but mobile phone records show that no such call took place.

A spokesman for Panorama said: ‘We understand that the programme maybe difficult viewing for Anni’s family and have approached it sensitively, including contacting her uncle, as the representative of the family, in advance, to let him know that it would air.

‘We received replies from Mr Hindocha which did not raise these objections. The police evidence we have obtained is neither manufactured nor stolen, nor did we pay for it. Should the Hindocha family wish to issue a statement then we would reflect their position in the programme.’

Dewani is fighting extradition to South Africa to stand trial for the murder of his Swedish-born wife. At a London court hearing in July, magistrates rejected his attempt to stay in the UK for further mental health treatment, but he will challenge the decision in the Supreme Court.

The documentary airs on BBC1 on Thursday at 9pm.

Anni Dewani sent text messages to her family before her wedding fearing she would never be happy once married to Shrien Dewani

Bride-to-be Anni Dewani sent desperate text messages to her family before her wedding,  saying: ‘I’m going to be unhappy for the rest of my life’.

Mrs Dewani sent a series of increasingly distressed messages to her cousin Sneha, expressing deep reservations about her fiancé Shrien.

In August 2010, two months after she got engaged, she spoke of her loneliness while visiting his family, writing: ‘Miss you so much. Don’t want to be with these people. I hate them. Want to cry myself to death.’ 

By September, while she was in India for wedding preparations, she appeared no happier and wrote on September 16: ‘Fighting a lot with Shrien. Told him I’m going home.

‘Wish I never got engaged. Everyone tells me how fortunate I am – even my designer tells me he’s good-looking and that I’m lucky. Absolutely sick.’

On September 21, five weeks before the extravagant Mumbai ceremony, she wrote: ‘I don’t want to marry him . . . we have nothing in common. He’s putting pressure on everything. He’s a perfectionist.’ 

In another text, she said: ‘Want to cry myself to death’.

The Swedish-born bride was concerned that her husband refused to be intimate with her, and texted: ‘One cannot even hug him.’ On September 22, she texted Sneha and said: ‘Told his and my parents I don’t want to get married.’ But her cousin said Mr Dewani persuaded her he would change and the wedding went ahead.

A week later, the situation appeared to have deteriorated and she wrote: ‘Hate him. I am not happy.’ 

Messages sent to her cousin from her honeymoon in South Africa show she was still distressed. On November 10, she said: ‘What shall I do? It’s been one day and I feel exactly the same as I did before.’

 But the next day, two days before her death, she seemed to have had a change of heart, texting: ‘Hello! It’s much better now. How are you? Is going better than before. Hard to explain but I’ll call you soon as I return. Hate the word divorce.’ 

On November 13, she was shot dead in a taxi on the outskirts of Cape Town.
