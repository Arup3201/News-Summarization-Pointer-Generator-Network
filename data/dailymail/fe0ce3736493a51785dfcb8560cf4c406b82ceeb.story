Chelsea have turned down a bid from Fulham to take veteran keeper Mark Schwarzer back to Craven Cottage.

The Australian arrived at Stamford Bridge in 2013 as reserve keeper, but has only made four appearances for the Blues and remains third in line behind Thibaut Courtois and Petr Cech.

The Cottagers have enquired about taking the 42-year-old on an emergency loan until the end of the season but Jose Mourinho has rejected the bid.

Former Blues No 1 Petr Cech has hinted that he may have to leave Stamford Bridge to keep his national spot

The Chelsea boss may be concerned that he could lose former undisputed No 1 Cech in January after the Czech Republic international spoke of having 'no time' to sit on the bench if he wants to keep his place in the national team.

Speaking to a Czech radio station, Cech said: 'I have not spoken to anyone but I think they know me well enough at the club to know that the situation is definitely not the way I would imagine.

'With the Euros [in 2016] and the national team in mind, there is no time for me to sit on the bench and not to play.

'If the situation will not start to improve for me, then I will want to solve it.'

Jose Mourinho has previously insisted that he would like both Cech and Thibaut Courtois to stay at the club

Courtois was forced off with a head injury after a clash with Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez but has since recovered
