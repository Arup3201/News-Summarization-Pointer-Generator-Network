Get the Nicole look! Jimmy Choo, which counts Miss Kidman as the face (and feet), has introduced a service where shoppers can design their own shoes and even engrave the sole

The luxury footwear brand, fronted by Nicole Kidman and loved by the Duchess of Cambridge, has introduced the online Made-To-Order service.

The new program allows shoppers to create their perfect shoe, choosing from four signature silhouettes with options for heel height, material and colour. To make it really personal, you can even monogram the sole of the shoe with a choice of up to four letters or symbols. 

Creative Director Sandra Choi has selected her favourite Jimmy Choo silhouettes, which, she says, are the time-honoured iconic designs, continually adored by clients worldwide and perfectly suited for customisation.

The tradition of made-to-order shoes, which start at around £475, can be traced back to the roots of the brand. 

Occasionally, by special request, a client would order a special fabrication, an exotic material or unique colour for a special event, most often for a red carpet event.

'Ideally suited for shoe aficionados looking to build a bespoke wardrobe or for brides planning their wedding shoe wardrobe, the made-to-order service combines quintessential skilled Italian Jimmy Choo craftsmanship invested with the luxurious quality of materials used,' say the brand.

The brand is currently fronted by Academy Award winner, Nicole Kidman.

Speaking about the campaign star,  Sandra Choi, Creative Director, said: 'Nicole embodies the tougher attitude and rebellious glamour that is key to the Pre-Fall collection’s aesthetic.

'She’s a true chameleon in how she transforms herself each season creating such strong imagery. She looks effortlessly alluring in the campaign which really makes the product shine.'
