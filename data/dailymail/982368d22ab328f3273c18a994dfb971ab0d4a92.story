All the best people use Google Glass: The Prince of Wales uses the latest technology

Technology giant Microsoft is secretly trialling a new computerised headband that could help blind people ‘see’.

The device, which resembles an Alice band, is similar to Google Glass in the way it relays information about its wearer’s surroundings.

But instead of being in the form of glasses, the ‘smart’ band uses an ear piece for instructions and updates.

In addition to helping blind people, it is claimed the band will have a dramatic impact for all by ‘revolutionising the urban experience.’ 

The scheme, which is being tested on a group of eight blind people in Reading, Berkshire, will be visited by the Queen on Thursday.

It has been used to help them find their way around Reading train station, a busy warren of staircases, escalators and ticket barriers.

Tim Gebbels, an actor who is blind and has tested early versions of the technology for Guide Dogs, a charity for the blind, hopes it will enable him to navigate towns and cities ‘as easily as anybody else’.

Guide Dogs chief executive Richard Leaman said: ‘This project hits right at the heart of the daily challenges blind people face in our urban landscape.’ 

Although small-scale at present, if successful then cities and transport networks around the country could be connected to its network, providing information on public places such as restaurants and museums.

The device works by bouncing information from sensors mounted on any item such as buildings or train carriages to a receiver in the wearer's headband. 

The user is able to receive personalised instructions, such as how to get to the airport on time if a train is delayed.

Google Glass has been criticised for privacy concerns because of an integrated camera that records images of the surroundings

Google Glass has been criticised for privacy concerns because of an integrated camera that records images of the surroundings.

Cinemas in America are on alert for the illegal recording of films and motorists have received tickets for driving while distracted.

The Microsoft device is expected to provoke less controversy as it does not cover the eyes or have a camera.

The project, called Cities Unlocked, involves Tesco, Barclays, Costa Coffee, First Great Western and First-Group. Microsoft is working in a consortium with Future Cities Catapult, a technology body funded by the Department of Business Innovation and Skills, and Guide Dogs.

The consortium said: ‘The short-term goal is to make the city more accessible and enjoyable for people with sight loss, by using new technologies. The longer term aim is to ... revolutionise the urban experience for everyone, through more effective collaboration and innovation.’
