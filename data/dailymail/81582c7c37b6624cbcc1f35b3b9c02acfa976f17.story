Morgan Schneiderlin has admitted his disappointment at Southampton for 'blocking' his proposed move, but now accepts the decision that has helped him break into the France squad.

The 24-year-old was heavily linked with several clubs over the summer, including Liverpool, Arsenal and a reunion with former manager Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham.

Although he admits he wanted to leave St Mary's, Schneiderlin has come to terms with the club's decision and even thanked them for the role they have played in his international development.

Speaking to RMC, he said: 'My situation was simple: at the end of the season my goal was to take the next step and join a club playing in the Champions League or the Europa League.

'There were offers on the table but Southampton made a clear choice, which was to keep me after the departure of certain players. They look to me for the future.

'I was 'blocked' but I must accept that because I have three years remaining on my contract. I could not afford to make a fuss and not play. I owe a lot to Southampton, who enabled me to make the France national team.

'I could not afford to go and clash with supporters who have always been cool with me. It would not have cool for me to end up in an endless showdown.'

The defensive midfielder did initially tweet a message during the stand-off saying '6 years of an amazing journey DESTROYED in 1 hour!!!' but returned to the team and scored twice in Saints' 3-1 defeat of West Ham. 

Speaking to L'Equipe, he added: 'I will continue working with my club. Even though I was a little disappointed not to be able to leave this summer, I know it's part of football.

'Southampton did everything to keep me and they also made some nice signings.

'It is thanks to them that I got into the French team, and now I have to focus on Southampton so I can be selected regularly.'
