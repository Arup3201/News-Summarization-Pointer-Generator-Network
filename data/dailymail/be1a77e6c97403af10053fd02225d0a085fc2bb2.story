Former hippie Pete Mckenzie has refused to wear shoes for 50 years - even on his wedding day.

The 69-year-old is dubbed Pete the Feet by pubgoers in Birmingham's leafy suburb of Moseley after insisting: 'I won't put the buggers back on until the day I die'.

A former  telephone exchange engineer, he even eschewed footwear on the day he married his wife Jennifer. But she didn't mind: they are still happily wed 44 years later and have three grandchildren.

Feet of endurance: Former hippie Pete Mckenzie has refused to wear shoes for 50 years, insisting: 'I won't put the buggers back on until the day I die' - and his unusual choice has made him a legend in Birmingham pubs

No cold feet! Dubbed Pete the Feet, the now-69-year-old refused even to wear shoes when he married his wife Jennifer in 1970 (pictured). They are still together, and he says he never feels the cold even in mid-winter

Pete has become the stuff of legend in local pubs, where he hawks homemade merchandise including stickers and cigarette lighter covers bearing his logo of two bare feet.

Those who know him well have been shown one of his two amputated little fingers - which had to be partially removed due to 'tendon problems' - which he keeps mummified in resin in his pocket.

The other is in formaldehyde on the mantelpiece of his £90,000 Moseley flat.

'I don’t like shoes, or in fact anything on my feet,' he said. 'Even when I got married, I didn’t wear shoes - and that was in a church.

'My wife has maybe seen me wearing shoes once or twice, but my daughter hasn’t and my granddaughters definitely haven’t.

Hippie: Locals said the much-loved eccentric (pictured in 1973) paints his nails to make up for a lack of shoes

'They just don’t suit me, they don’t suit my feet. Ever since taking my shoes off permanently, I’ve been called called Pete the Feet. I won’t put the buggers back on until the day I die.'

The pensioner said he stopped donning footwear for good as a hippie in the mid-sixties.

He was in his 20s and had already tried to escape the constraints of footwear but was scolded repeatedly by his mother. 

'As far back as I can remember, I never liked wearing shoes,' he said. 'I was walking home once when I was 16 and took my shoes and socks off and flung them over a bridge.'

He insists that in the last 50 years his bare feet have never got cold - even when temperatures are sub-zero.

Humans first began wearing shoes 40,000 years ago - but there is still a strong 'barefoot movement' among activists who say we should return to how nature intended.

Especially in cities, the dangers are obvious. They include cuts which can become dangerously infected or lead to illnesses such as tetanus, while people on beaches fear stepping on drug needles.

It's a common myth that it's illegal to drive barefoot - in fact, the Highway Code only specifies that 'clothing and footwear do not prevent you using the controls in the correct manner'. That counts out loose-fitting flip flops.

Much of the stigma is about poverty - bare feet were seen as a sign of homelessness and many bars and restaurants have entry policies which bar people without shoes.

But a burgeoning barefoot movement is trying to 'reclaim' the trend, insisting many commonly-held myths are untrue.

Activists say shoes are no better than feet at repelling germs, correcting posture or preventing all but the most serious injuries. 

'They swear blind that they must be freezing but I tell people to touch them and they always reel back because my feet are hot,' he claimed. 'People get cold feet because they wear shoes and socks.'

He uses a mobility scooter - with the personalised numberplate PTF 1 - but says that is to do with his 'icky ticker' as he had a heart attack some years ago, and his feet are still in perfect health.

'People seem to think that I collect dirt, but the fact is that I wash my feet every day,' he said.

'If I stand in anything that I shouldn’t then I really know about it, but if you’re wearing shoes you might not realise then trample it all over the bloody carpet.

'Where as I know I stand in it then I can just wash it off my feet dead easy.' 

He added: 'In the sixties it wasn’t uncommon to see people not wearing shoes around Moseley, it was very hippy place back then.

'I find my notoriety a bit silly, I don’t think people should be so bothered - I find it amusing really.

'I do get nasty comments but it doesn’t bother me. Sometimes I’ll go to the pub and they say sorry I can’t serve you, you haven’t got shoes on.

'One time I was told that staff couldn’t serve me because they sold food, but as I was being taken out there was woman with a dog, feeding it at the table.

'I’ve been into pubs where there’s dog muck on the floor in the pub, and they say I’ll bring dirt in. It’s their fault, not mine.' 

The pensioner has been honoured in multiple pubs around the country with his own glass inscribed with his name, from which he drinks his favourite Cotswolds-brewed Lion ale.

A little help: The pensioner rides a vintage mobility scooter, but it is more to do with his heart than his feet

Merchandise: As well as making stickers and cigarette lighters, Pete has the personalised scooter plate PTF 1

Alice Chandler, 26, a supervisor at the Sun at the Station pub, told MailOnline: 'I've known him since I was ten. He knows my mum and used to buy me crisps after school.

'I don't ever remember him wearing shoes. He's always painted his toenails different colours though.

'Everyone knows him and speaks to him and buys him drinks. He's got both of his little fingers amputated and he's mummified one in resin which he keeps in his pocket. The other one's in formaldehyde on his mantelpiece.

'He's a local legend. I expect his feet are like leather by now. Nothing could faze him.'
