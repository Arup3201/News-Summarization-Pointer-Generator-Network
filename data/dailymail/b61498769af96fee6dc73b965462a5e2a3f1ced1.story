She may have poked fun at her own political career earlier in the evening.

But when Sarah Palin came face-to-face with hecklers at the SNL 40th anniversary after-show party, they were the ones who became the butt of the joke.

The former Governor of Alaska was captured by TMZ dishing out insults to mouthy individuals standing next to the red carpet after the star-studded event in New York, which finished in the early hours of Monday morning. 

The 51-year-old politician, who wore a white mini-dress to the landmark show, became involved in a back-and-forth of snide remarks when she was told she looked old and was asked to put her clothes on while posing for selfies.

Comeback: Sarah Palin confronts hecklers on her way out of the SNL 40th anniversary after-show party in New York after she was told to 'put some clothes on'

Dishing out insults: During the back-and-forth with the mouthy fan she told him not to be jealous of her and added that she was on the right side of the velvet rope 

She told them they could talk to her when they had a job  while boasting she was on the right side of the velvet rope.

During the footage one man is heard shouting: 'Can you pose for a photo because I have Obamacare expenses?'

In response, she said: 'Are you in show-business? No? So don't be jealous.'

The man then continued: 'You look old Sarah. Put some clothes on Sarah,' to which she retorted: 'When you get a job, you can talk to me.'

As she walked away, another person said: 'Good luck in Iowa, no one is going to vote for you.' 

During the encounter with fans one complimented her mini- dress. Palin then admitted it was her daughter Bristol's.

Response: Before walking away she told one man who told her she looked old: 'When you get a job, you can talk to me

Posing: In between the remarks, she posed for selfies with more appreciative fans outside of the venue 

Second-hand: She admitted to one supporter she was wearing a dress owned by her daughter Bristol 

The politician was a frequent target of the SNL cast when she ran for Vice President in 2008. She was played by Tina Fey because of their bizarrely similar looks. 

The skit reached its climax when Palin made appearance herself alongside the actress.

She was involved in a question and answer sketch run by Jerry Seinfeld during the landmark show.

The comedian wrongly identified her as Tina Fey, before correcting him.

Palin then asked how much the show would pay her to run for president in 2016.

Seinfeld balked: 'No figure is too high Sarah!'

She raised the stakes: 'What if I had Donald Trump as my running mate?' 

Awkward encounter: During the landmark show, Taylor Swift and Palin were sat next to each other - and were seen pulling faces 

Mimicked: The politician was a frequent target of the SNL cast when she ran for Vice President in 2008. She was played by Tina Fey (pictured that year) and made a cameo appearance
