A mother suffered an agonising death after drinking from a Sprite bottle that she later claimed contained cannabis fertiliser, an inquest heard.

Sarah Jane Moss, 23, drank the liquid while staying at boyfriend Daniel Fairbrother’s home, causing her to vomit blood as her face swelled to twice its normal size.

The damage to her throat was so significant that her oesophagus was corroded to the size of a 'piece of string’ and her weight plummeted to 5st.

Agonising: Sarah Jane Moss, 23, died six months after consuming liquid from a Sprite bottle that she later told her mother was fertiliser for cannabis plants, an inquest at Stockport Magistrates' Court heard

Miss Moss, from Mottram, Hyde, died six months later, the inquest at Stockport Magistrates' Court heard.

She initially claimed that the liquid was a fluid used in a fish tank fluid before later telling her mother Lynn Moss that the liquid was used to fertilise cannabis plants.

She also claimed there had been a cannabis farm at her boyfriend's house.

The inquest heard that Miss Moss had been staying at Mr Fairbrother's Stalybridge house in January 2011 when she drank from the Sprite bottle stored on a kitchen shelf.

Daniel, described as her ‘on-off’ boyfriend since 2009 and the father of her child, called his mother to say Sarah was sick.

Mrs Fairbrother arrived at the house with her other son Richard, before taking Miss Moss to hospital.

Medical staff, who were told Sarah had drunk fish tank fluid, sent her home with instructions to drink lots of fluids.

But when her condition worsened two days later, her mother was forced to bring her back to hospital.

Mrs Moss told the inquest: 'Julie said she had drunk liquid for the fish tank and at that stage I didn’t feel any panic.

'But when I pulled up and Sarah came out I had the shock of my life.'

She said Miss Moss had sores and a red rash round her mouth, her face had doubled in size, that she was struggling to speak and was throwing up blood.

Staff at the hospital were once again told that Miss Moss had drunk fish tank fluid.

When doctors were finally given the Sprite bottle by Mr Fairbrother’s family, tests revealed it had a dangerously high level of alkaline.

Doctors said they were in ‘unknown territory' and had to phone the National Poison Information Service for advice.

After six days in hospital, Miss Moss discharged herself because she felt uncomfortable on the ward - but she was readmitted four days later in severe pain.

Her condition worsened over the following months - with tests revealing her oesophagus was as thin as a string - and she was transferred to a surgical unit in February where it was planned to remove the damaged part of her oesophagus.

Miss Moss had an operation at Tameside hospital on June 20 but three days later she was found to have an infection. Following further emergency surgery she died.

Mrs Moss said: 'That was the last time I spoke to Sarah. She said ‘I love you mum, I’ll be all right’.'

Mrs Moss said that her daughter told her on that she had consumed fertiliser.

But Mr Fairbrother’s mother Julie told the inquest his family still believed the bottle was filled with fish tank fluid.

The coroner asked both Mrs Fairbrother and Richard Fairbrother if they believed Sarah had drunk cannabis fertiliser. Both said they believed the substance to be ph neutraliser for a fish tank.

Home office pathologist Dr Philip Plumb told the inquest Sarah died of peritonitis aesophagul and gastric strictures caused by the ingestion of a corrosive substance.

Sarah, a former pupil at Copley High school, had a young daughter who is now four.

The inquest continues.
