Illegal metal detecting at Hadrian's Wall is wrecking the country's cultural heritage and stealing items of archaeological interest land owners, police and experts have warned.

Areas close to 1,900-year-old World Heritage Site, which stretched for 80 miles across some of Northern England's most rugged scenery, have been hacked away by 'nighthawkers'.

Turf has been pulled out and unscrupulous searchers have raked through the dirt to steal items which could have laid hidden since Roman times.

Police have warned that 'nighthawkers' - people who use metal detectors to raid historical sites at night - are wrecking part of Britain's cultural heritage (pictured, an excavation close to the wall)

English Heritage, the National Trust and Northumberland National Park have joined police in issuing a warning to anyone carrying out the activity that it is illegal and they will be prosecuted.

In recent months, illegal digs have taken place at National Trust land at Steel Rigg and Peel Crags on Hadrian's Wall.

These sites have special protection as Scheduled Ancient Monuments and even using a metal detector without authorisation from English Heritage is an offence.

Mark Harrison, English Heritage National Crime Advisor said: 'The practice of "nighthawking", particularly from such important sites as Hadrian's Wall, is an issue that we take very seriously.

'We recognise that the majority of the metal detecting community comply with the laws and regulations relating to the discovery and recovery of objects from the land, but just as it is against the law to break into someone's house and steal their possessions, so it is illegal to damage land and steal valuable historical artefacts.

'The objects they are stealing belong to the landowner, in this case the National Trust, and the history they are stealing belongs to all of us.'

Because the site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument it is illegal to even use a metal detector without permission, and people are strictly forbidden from taking away what they find

Eric Wilton, National Trust Countryside Manager for Hadrian's Wall Country Group said: 'It is disappointing at a time when archaeologists and legitimate metal detectorists are working together more closely that this incident has occurred.

'The National Trust wants the public to enjoy its many and varied sites, such as these at Steel Rigg and Pele Gap, but cannot tolerate illegal metal detecting that harms the appreciation of our collective heritage.'

Chris Jones, the Historic Environment Officer for the Northumberland National Park said: 'The illegal removal of archaeological material is a serious offence. 

'Such criminality has a damaging effect on people's ability to understand and enjoy the cultural heritage of the National Park.'

West Tynedale Neighbourhood Inspector Kevin Oates of Northumbria Police said: 'Because of the harm that nighthawking causes to our heritage, Northumbria Police are committed to investigating these issues.

'Any perpetrators can be expected to be prosecuted. Anyone with any information about unlawful metal detecting should call the police on 101, quoting incident number 418, 12/11/14.'
