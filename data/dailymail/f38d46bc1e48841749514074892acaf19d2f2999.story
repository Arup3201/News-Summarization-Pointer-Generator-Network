This is the moment an angry sea lion took revenge on fishermen after being caught in their nets and dragged on board their boat.

The Russians fishing off Russia's Pacific coast were hauling in their nets when they discovered a huge sea lion thrashing about inside and lowered it to the deck.

But after helping the animal to get free one of the fishermen was not quite quick enough and was grabbed on the shoulder in the jaws of the furious creature and flung across the boat like a rag doll.

The sea lion then moves around the deck looking for a way out before taking on the ship's dog, biting the hound because it too was not quick enough to get out of the way.

The sea lion is left looking as if it is about to start tackling the other fishermen as well, but the crew say they eventually managed to drive it back into the water by using a powerful hose normally deployed to clean the deck.

Adult male sea lions can weigh over 400kg, while females weigh 85-160kg, and according to experts who studied the Russian video, the animal caught in the nets came from the Steller species of sea lion, a near-threatened species found off northern Pacific coasts from Japan to California.

The Steller sea lion is the largest of all five species found in the world.

It hunts fish, squid, octopus and occasionally, smaller seals, and although the males are especially aggressive, particularly when defending harems of up to 25 females in the breeding season, it is believed the sea lion on the Russian ship was a female.

Every year many sea lions are accidentally drowned by fishing boats and fishermen are obliged to report deaths. 

Most of the animals suffocate after being kept underwater in the huge nets.
