Cyril Osment, who had his nose removed because of skin cancer said his life was transformed after he was given the prosthetic replacement

A pensioner who had his nose removed because of skin cancer has appealed for helping after losing the artificial replacement.

Cyril Osment, 83, said his life was transformed after he was given the prosthetic appendage three months ago following the operation.

But he is now worried about leaving the house after losing the nose during a trip to the dentist.

The grandfather-of-seven is appealing for residents near his home in Alweston, Dorset, to keep an eye out for the rubber mould.

Mr Osment was diagnosed with skin cancer in autumn last year and immediately went under the knife at Salisbury District Hospital, Wiltshire.

On Monday he set off in his original Mini on the one mile journey to Wessex House Dental Practice in Westbury, Dorset.

The retired newsagent is sure his nose was still on when he got to the surgery. It was only when he got home that he noticed it was missing.

He said: 'When I got home from the dentist I caught a glimpse of myself in my bedroom mirror and realised my nose was no longer attached to my face.'

He said that the prosthetic nose had changed his life and without it he doesn’t feel confident enough to go out.

'I’m just hoping someone sees it and I get it back,' he said. 'It was one of the most wonderful things for me, having this done.

'At the moment my face is covered with bandages and dressings and people keep asking me what has happened to my nose - it’s made me worried about going out.'

The divorcee is hoping he will be able to get a replacement nose - worth around £1,500 - from the same hospital where it was fitted.

'I already have an appointment with a consultant about getting a new nose,' he said.

'I’m really worried that I won’t be able to get a new one though as the first thing they said to me before was "make sure you don’t damage it as you won’t get another one".

'I’m hoping that maybe I’ll be allowed a new one though as I think that the magnets had begun to fail in my previous one.

'My nose was beginning to fall off quite regularly; the day before I lost it it fell off three times whilst I was gardening.

'Usually
the magnets are so strong they pull the nose out of my hand and on to 
my face, but recently I’d started noticing it wasn’t quite as strong.

'I just really hope that I’ll be able to get another one and carry on with my life.'

In August last year, MailOnline reported how nasal cancer patient Bert Eastham had found a novel way of ensuring he did not misplace his prosthetic nose, by sticking it to the side of his fridge.

Mr Eastham's nose was removed three years earlier when it was found to contain cancerous cells.

In July 2012, the 64-year-old was fitted with a prosthetic nose which was held on to his face using magnets.
