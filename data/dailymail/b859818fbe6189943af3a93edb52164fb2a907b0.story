Turkish police detained two Georgian nationals after a woman was caught trying to smuggle herself into the country curled up inside a tiny suitcase.

Customs officials working at the Sarpi border crossing, close to the city of Artvin, ordered officers to inspect a suitcase belonging to a 25-year-old man after he was spotted acted suspiciously.

Upon opening the luggage officers were shocked to discover a 22-year-old woman curled up inside. She later told officers that she tried to smuggle herself in to the country because a previous conviction in the country meant she had been banned from travelling there.

Turkish police detained the pair after customs officials made the discovery on Monday, but they were both later released, sent back to Georgia and ordered not to return.

The woman told investigators that she had an outstanding ban on her travelling to Turkey after being convicted of an unspecified offence.

It was not immediately clear what had attracted customs officials to the 25-year-old Georgian man, but the suitcase in which the woman was hidden was barely large enough to hold a human body.

The tight squeeze forced her to curl up into an uncomfortable-looking fetal position.

The border crossing where the couple had tried to smuggle themselves in Turkey lies near Sarp - a tiny town on the Black Sea, around 50 miles north of the city of Artvin.

Although Sarp is home to just 212 people, it is one of only three official border crossings along the 170-mile long Turkey-Georgia border.

The Sarp border crossing, in the District of Hopa, Artvin Province, opened in the late 1980s, when Georgia was still part of the Soviet Union. 

After independence in 1991, post-communist Georgia suffered from civil unrest and economic crisis for most of the 1990s. 

Georgia covers a territory of 26,911 square miles, and its population is almost five million.
