The White House chief of staff accidentally named an American woman who is being held hostage by ISIS militants on live TV.

Denis McDonough revealed the first name of the 26-year-old aid worker, whose identity has been kept from public knowledge for safety reasons, during an interview yesterday.

The woman was kidnapped by ISIS militants along with other aid workers while helping people displaced by the Syrian war in August 2013.

Slip: White House chief of staff Denis McDonough revealed the first name of a 26-year-old American woman kidnapped by ISIS in August 2013, whose identity has been kept secret for safety reasons

The other aid workers are thought to have been released, but ISIS demanded $6million for the American woman's release as recently as 2014. 

As part of the deal, ISIS also demanded the release of Aafia Siddiqui, an MIT-trained neuroscientist who was convicted in 2010 of trying to kill U.S. officials and accused of planning the construction of dirty bombs to be used in terrorist attacks.

Mr McDonough suffered a 'slip of the tongue' during an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC's This Week.

As the pair discussed the current hostage situation, which has seen one Japanese prisoner reportedly killed by ISIS, Mr McDonough accidentally revealed the American hostage's name. 

'As it relates to our hostages, we are obviously continuing to work those matters very, very aggressively,' Mr McDonough told Mr Stephanopoulos.

'We are sparing no expense and sparing no effort, both in trying to make sure that we know where they are and make sure that we're prepared to do anything we must to try to get them home.

'But [redacted] family knows how strongly the president feels about this, and we will continue to work this.' 

The woman's first name has not previously been released and security officials have requested for it to be redacted from reports on Mr McDonough's interview.

McDonough's slip came as President Obama, currently on a three-day state visit to India, offered his condolences to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe over the killing of a Japanese national by ISIS.

In a statement from the White House, the President said that the United States will stand 'shoulder to shoulder' with Japan.

The Japanese government is still reviewing an online video that purports to show the murder of ISIS prisoner Haruna Yukawa.

The U.S. President  also called for the immediate release of the second Japanese hostage being held by the militants, Kenji Goto.
