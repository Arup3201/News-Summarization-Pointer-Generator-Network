Two teachers who were fired from a New York City high school in 2009 after an alleged lesbian tryst in a classroom are getting their jobs back after an appeals court in Manhattan ruled in their favor in a decision handed down Thursday.

Cindy Mauro, a 34-year-old French 
teacher at Brooklyn’s James Madison High School, was caught half naked 
in a classroom, 'kneeling between the legs' of a topless fellow teacher,
 an independent arbitrator found.

Mauro
 and her alleged lover, 
32-year-old Spanish teacher Alini Brito, had vehemently denied 
allegations of a 'lesbian
 lovefest.' The 34-year-old claimed that she was only helping Brito deal
 with her diabetes by bringing her some candy to raise her blood glucose
 levels.

Even if the allegations of sexual misconduct are true, the five-judge Appellate Court ruled that firing the two women was 'shockingly disproportionate to (their) misconduct.'

'While (Brito’s) behavior demonstrated a
 lapse in judgment, there is no evidence that this incident was anything
 but a one-time mistake,' the panel ruled.

In their decision, the justices ruled that even if the reports are true, 'consensual sexual contact' was not grounds to fire them.

The justices also noted the 'unblemished disciplinary records' of each teacher, as well as their 'consistently satisfactory teacher ratings.'

In Brito's case, her supervisor once described her as 'one of the best teachers she had ever worked with,' according to the report, first obtained by the New York Daily news.

The court sent the case back to city education officials with instructions to impose a less-severe penalty.

Sine the allegations first arose - on the word of a janitor who claimed he saw the two women engaged in sexual activity - both teachers denied they were 
ever naked, alleging that the custodian who walked in on them during a 
school talent show had a vivid imagination.

The scandal earned the school a suggestive nickname: Horndog High.

Lawyers
 representing the city said in court documents that the teachers’ alibi 
was hard to believe because no medical equipment was found in Room 337, 
where the pair allegedly was busted.

The city also pointed out that Brito 
and Mauro had climbed six flights of stairs before arriving at their 
destination, passing multiple classrooms and more than one bathroom — 
unlikely behavior for someone suffering from low blood sugar.

Judge Robert Torres apparently agreed,
 upholding an arbitrator’s decision in 2012 to fire Mauro as 
‘rational and with plausible basis.’

The ruling came less than two weeks 
after another judge allowed Brito to return to the classroom after she had 
successfully sued the Department of Education.

Judge Alice Schlesinger wrote in her opinion that Brito's punishment was ‘excessive and shockingly severe,’ the New York Post reported.

‘We have children who are deprived of a first-class, 
caring teacher, and a teacher who, due to one sensational, publicly 
exploited incident where she exhibited extremely poor judgment, is 
deprived of continuing a career she loves and excels at.

‘That is not a good balance, in the opinion of this court. In fact, the imbalance is shockingly bad,’ Schlesinger wrote.

The judge criticized the city for 
destroying a surveillance tape supposedly documenting the act, which she
 said had deprived the teacher of due process.

Denial: Brito and Mauro claim nothing inappropriate went on and that witnesses let their imaginations get the best of them

Brito’s lawyers claimed it was a crucial piece of evidence that could prove witness accounts to be false.

The married teacher was fired in January, 2012, following the release of a report that claimed Mauro had lured her away from a student song-and-dance 
competition with promises of sugar and candy.

In her lawsuit, Brito claimed that the account of the witness to the events was not reliable because he never entered the classroom and a 300-pound janitor was blocking his view through a small opening in the door.

'There were no shenanigans,' said her lawyer Michael Valentine.

'He sees through this other custodian, who's 6'4" or 6'5", and sees a partially naked body lying on the floor.'

Doubt: School officials find it hard to believe the pair walked up six flights of stairs to treat a diabetic's blood-sugar problem

Valentine offered a much more innocent
 version of events, claiming: 'Upon immediately entering the classroom, 
Brito's knees buckled, at which point Brito laid down off to the right 
but at the foot of the classroom door.

'Mauro assisted Brito by placing 
Brito's sweater under her head and elevated her legs in a chair. Mauro 
also obtained a couple of sugar packets from her desk and gave them to 
Brito.'

It's unclear when - or if - the women will be returning to their jobs at James Madison High School.
