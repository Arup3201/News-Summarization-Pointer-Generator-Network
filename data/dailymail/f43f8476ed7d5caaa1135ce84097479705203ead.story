They had come to see their favorite band perform, but a couple of concert-goers attempted to upstage a punk rock band by stripping off onstage and performing sex acts on one another.

The obscene sex act was performed during a January 15 show featuring seminal hardcore-punk band the Dead Kennedy's.

The incident took place at Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach in San Diego, right in front of the audience, while the band were playing their set.

On stage: A couple were engaged in an explicit sex act during a Dead Kenney's concert in California

Side show: A number of people took photos of the couple. Many then went back to listening to the band

The woman was fully exposed while the man performed a lewd act on her, yet the band played on regardless.

The local sheriff's department has been determining whether the couple could face charges, however they are unlikely to do so as so far no complaints have been received. 

Exposing yourself in a public place is only an offence if other people are 'offended or annoyed' by it under Californian law, however it could be that the sex act was a violation of the business and professions code.

The two people involved in the incident were eventually thrown out.

Management at Belly Up Tavern have released a statement to KGTV:

'Of course, we don't condone this activity in our establishment and security stopped it right away. This is certainly a first for us.' 

Numerous concert-goers at the Belly Up Tavern took photos of what was happening on stage as the woman was laying on her back. Others also watched for a few seconds before going back to listening to the band.
