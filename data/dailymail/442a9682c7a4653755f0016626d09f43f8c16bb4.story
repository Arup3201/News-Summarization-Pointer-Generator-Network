Sebastian Coe has written off the chance a British men's football team playing at the Rio 2016 Olympics but has raised the possibility of a women's team doing so again.

Britain did field football teams at London 2012 but without any Scots or Northern Irish players in the men's side following opposition from the Scottish and Irish FAs.

The men's side featuring the like of Ryan Giggs, Aaron Ramsey and Daniel Sturridge went out in the quarter-finals on penalties against South Korea.

Sebastian Coe says there's very little chance of a British men's football team at the 2016 Olympics 

The men's British football team were knocked out on penalties at the quarter-final stage in 2012

Coe said there could still be a British women's football team in Rio but nothing has been confirmed 

Lord Coe, chairman of the British Olympic Association, said the body was working under the assumption there would be no men's team in 2016 given the difficulties encountered in the run-up to London.

Speaking at the Securing Sport conference in London, Coe said the chances of a British men's team in Rio were 'unlikely'.

He added: 'It's just in the 'hard' basket. Possibly a women's team but I would rather assume that, operationally, that's not going to happen in terms of the men's team.

The British women's football team were also eliminated at the quarter-final stage at London 2012 

Daniel Sturridge missed a penalty in the shoot-out defeat to South Korea two years ago

'Possibly with (the) women's (team), we've still got some discussions.

'But certainly, the men's team, I'm not sure I have the will to live through that process again.'

The women's 2012 squad featured two Scots but the rest of the players were English. They lost to Canada 2-0 in the quarter-finals.

It was the first time Britain had had football teams in the Games since 1960. The issue is a sensitive one as the Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland FAs fear participation could threaten their individual status within FIFA.
