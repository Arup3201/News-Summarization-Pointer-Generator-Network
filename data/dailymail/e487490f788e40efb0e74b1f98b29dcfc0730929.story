Spain defender Sergio Ramos is refusing to wallow in the pain of Friday’s 5-1 drubbing by Holland and will use it instead as a motivation for their next game.

The world champions cannot afford to lose against Chile at the Maracana on Wednesday and Ramos insists their Dutch horror show will help them.

‘I’m not going to spend another second thinking about that match,’ said the Real Madrid defender, who was given the runaround by Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben.

‘This team has experience and has been through bad times. It has been able to come back from setbacks like this. That makes it great.’

One setback was losing against Switzerland in their first game at the 2010 World Cup, a tournament they went on to win.

With Chile beating Australia in their first game, the pressure is on Spain again and Fernando Torres accepts there is little room for error.

The Chelsea striker said: ‘Your opponents know you have to win. You can’t afford to draw and they’ll try to make the most of any anxiety we might have.’

Ramos dismissed suggestions that Spain were at a disadvantage against Holland because they had been training in the milder south for a match in steamy Salvador.

‘We are training here in good temperatures, in good conditions and with good facilities,’ he said. ‘If we’d won, you wouldn’t be talking about this subject.’

After his howler against Holland on Friday night, calls have grown in Spain for manager Vicentre Del Bosque to drop keeper Iker Casillas. The pair were spotted talking as Spain trained on Saturday and Casillas certainly didn't look happy after Del Bosque walked away (bottom).
