Attack: Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan, above, stated his opposition to Barack Obama over action in Syria, branding the president an 'assassin'

The Iranian President, Hassan Rouhani, staged a private dinner party in a New York which was attended by Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, it has been revealed.

Farrakhan, who famously branded Barack Obama a 'murderer' over the death of former Libya leader Colonel Gaddafi, attended the event in the UN Hotel in Manhattan on Tuesday night.

Rouhani’s dinner party was held on the second floor of the hotel, where the Iranian delegation is staying.

At the same time, President Obama and his party are at the Waldorf Astoria just blocks away.

The private party was hosted by the Iranian leader after he gave a speech to the UN general assembly earlier that day.

Farrakhan, accompanied by a huge entourage of hired security was spotted leaving the hotel at around 10pm on Tuesday.

They stopped traffic while the leader of the religious movement and his staff piled into cars with lights, sirens and New Jersey license plates.

Also at Rouhani’s event was the German Deputy Foreign Minister Peter Florin, who was elected president of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday.

Farrakhan made headlines during the General Assembly last year when he dined with Rouhani's predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Farrakhan is no stranger to controversy having caused a row with anti-Semitic remarks which aligned himself with former Iranian presidents and other controversial world leaders.

Two years ago Farrakhan launched a verbal attack on Barack Obama, saying the president was a 'murderer' in response to the death of Libyan dictator Colonal Gadaffi.

Speaking at the time, he said: 'We voted for our brother Barack, a beautiful human being with a sweet heart... now he's an assassin.'
