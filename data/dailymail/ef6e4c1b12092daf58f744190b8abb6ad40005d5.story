Floyd Mayweather says sometimes he has to turn down request from fans in order to focus on himself and his daughters.

Mayweather took time out of his busy training schedule for his upcoming fight with Manny Pacquiao to take a trip to the 550ft ferris wheel at the LINQ hotel in Las Vegas.

And in a video posted on his Facebook page, the undefeated welterweight champion said that while it breaks his heart to say no to his fans for requests for autographs and photos, sometimes it is necessary.

In the video filmed while he is driving his 1996 V12 600 Mercedes, he said: ‘If you are not in the position you will never know, some days you want to go out and not sign autographs, or you want to go out and not take pictures.

‘It hurts my feelings but I have to say no sometimes. I don’t say no to my fans because I don’t want to sign for them or I don’t want to take a picture.

‘I am saying no because it is alright for me to take time off for myself and for my daughter. I want to give her my undivided attention.’

And with the date for the richest fight in ring history fast approaching, Mayweather says his preparations are going well.

He added: ‘The training camp has been good. I’m happy and I’m pretty sure my father is happy and everything is great.’
