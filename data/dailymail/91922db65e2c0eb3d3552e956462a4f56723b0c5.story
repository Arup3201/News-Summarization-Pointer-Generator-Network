Louis van Gaal's arrival at Manchester United's Carrington training ground has hailed the dawning of a new era at England's biggest club, but the man that knows him best is relaxing in the knowledge he'll be top of the boss's team-sheet.

Robin van Persie took time out after Holland's run to third in the World Cup under Van Gaal by visiting Barbados with his wife Bouchra and his children.

The hitman even had a little reminder of his World Cup exploits, donning some bright orange shorts like those he excelled in in Brazil.

Van Persie was also happy to stop and chat to fans on the beach at the sandy lane resort, posing for pictures and signing shirts.

The striker's coach for Holland, former Oranje striker Patrick Kliuvert, has meanwhile insisted his former No 1 Van Gaal will be targetting the Premier League in his opening season.

‘He’s a great coach and I know he’s looking forward to taking over at Manchester United,’ the former Barcelona frontman told TalkSport.

Teammates: Thomas Vermaelen has been consistently linked with a move to Man Utd where he could link up with RVP

‘It will be a difficult year but I know he can do it. He can work well with the squad.

‘He’s absolutely going for the Premier League title. A club like Manchester United always has to go for the title and that’s what he wants in his first year.

‘They also need to get back into the Champions League.’
