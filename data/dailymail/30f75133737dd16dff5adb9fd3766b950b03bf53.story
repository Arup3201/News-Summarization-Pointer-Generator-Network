The family of a Marine murdered on a  military base are now suing the Department of Defense to get more information on their late son's death by an Afghani teen who was supposed to be his ally.

Lance Cpl Greg Buckley, 21, and two other Marines were gunned down on August 10, 2012, while working out in the gym at Forward Operating Base Delhi, in Afghanistan's Helmand province. 

The 17-year-old 'tea boy' who carried out the attack using an AK-47 was given permission to enter the base as a 'personal assistant' to an Afghani police chief who lived alongside the U.S. troops and was later accused of aiding the Taliban.

What really happened? The family of Lance Cpl Greg Buckley, who was shot dead by an Afghani teen on a military base, are now suing the military for more information on his death. Above, the Marine's father Greg Sr (left), mother Marine (center) and two brothers attend his funeral in August 2012

Accusations: Buckley's father Greg Buckley Sr (left) has accused the military of covering up the truth about his son's (right) death, saying he believes they could have prevented the shooting if they listened to a warning from a fellow Marine

Two years later, Buckley's family still haven't received autopsy or investigative reports on their son's death - though they are entitled to these documents under federal law.

The Long Island, New York family are now filing a lawsuit against the Marine Corps, Department of Defense, the Navy, the U.S. Naval Criminal Investigative Service and former Marine Corps Commandant Gen James Amos, accusing the defendants of withholding the full truth surrounding their son's death.

Buckley's father Gregory Buckley Sr believes the military could have prevented his son's death if they had listened to warning's about the so-called Afghani allies who were granted wide-spread access to the base - with some even living there.

Warning: Buckley's father says fellow Marine Jason Brezler issued a warning about the sketchy dealings of an Afghani police chief named Sarwar Jan who lived on the base to troops stationed back in Afghanistan. Brezler (left) pictured above with Jan (right)

'He says we have a bad feeling that we are not going to be able to ever get home. I think these people here are going to turn on us. He says they're just not right,' Buckley told Fox News. 

Buckley was just three days away from a surprise visit home when he was shot dead in the base's gym where he was supposed to be safe. Staff Sgt Scott Dickinson and Cpl Richard Rivera were also killed in the attack.

The perpetrator of the attack was a 17-year-old Afghani named Aynoddin, who was granted access to the base as a 'personal assistant' to local police chief Sarwar Jan - a resident of the base.

It was later revealed that the teen may have been one of the sex slaves that Jan supposedly brought onto the base. He was not vetted and later talked about killing the soldiers in the name of Jihad. Aynoddin was convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison.  

Before the attack, a fellow Marine named Jason Brezler warned his comrades stationed overseas about Jan's shady background in an email. 

Brezler was subsequently honorably discharged for sending the email from his personal, unsecured, Yahoo account.

'He shot my son point blank with an AK-47. Shot him four times in his chest and once in his neck. He was in the gym with a pair of shorts and a tank top on,' Buckley Sr said. 'How is that allowed?'

Buckley Sr says he now wants the military to step up and acknowledge that they were at fault.  

'I want them to admit that they were wrong. And I want someone to be held responsible for my son's death.'  

Loss of a son: Above, Greg's father is overcome with emotion at his son's funeral, which was held at St Agnes Cathedral 

Mourning: Buckley's casket is carried out of the cathedral after a mass on Saturday, August 18
