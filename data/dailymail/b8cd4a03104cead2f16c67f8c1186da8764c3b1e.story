A plaque commemorating two children murdered by the IRA was ripped down for a drunken prank, it emerged yesterday.

One man carried out the vandalism  while two friends looked on before they left the memorial lying on the pavement in Warrington town centre. Shortly afterwards an older man took it home.

The culprits are likely to be ordered to apologise to relatives of the victims, while the plaque – which was recovered at the weekend when the alleged thief was arrested – will be put back in place at a ceremony.

There was outrage last month when the
bronze memorial to two victims of the 1993 blast – 12-year-old Tim 
Parry and three-year-old Johnathan Ball – went missing.

But a breakthrough at the weekend after the release of CCTV images led to its recovery and the arrest of the suspects.

On Saturday, police arrested a 
57-year-old man in the Penketh area of Warrington, where Tim’s family 
used to live, and recovered the memorial.

They also released photographs showing three young men hanging around the plaque on the night it vanished.

Shortly afterwards, the men handed 
themselves in and confessed that two of them, aged 27, had stood by and 
watched while their 28-year-old friend took it off the wall.

He abandoned it on the pavement, before it was allegedly taken home by the 57-year-old around 6am.

The older man was released on police 
bail after being arrested for ‘theft by finding’, while the 
27-year-olds, from Warrington, were released without charge.

Tim’s father Colin, 65, is being consulted on what action should be taken against the 28-year-old from nearby Newton-le-Willows.

Mr Parry and community representatives will also be consulted about whether the 57-year-old should be prosecuted.

It is the second time Warrington memorials have been targetted.

Just last month, Lithuanian Spartakas Grachauskas, 25,was jailed for 18 weeks after he was caught red handed trying to steal another plaque commemorating the Tim Parry, Johnathan Ball and the 54 people hurt in the IRA attack.

The Warrington bombings consisted of two separate attacks – the first in February 1993 at a gas storage facility and the second the following month in the centre of the Cheshire town.

In the second attack, The Samaritans received a coded message wrongly stating a bomb would be detonated in Liverpool.

In the event, there were two blasts, in litter bins outside Boots and Argos, within a minute of each other causing carnage and confusion.

Johnathan Ball was killed almost instantly and Tim Parry was so badly injured his parents later had to take the agonising decision to turn off his life support machine.

More than 50 other victims were injured, with many suffering serious shrapnel wounds and cuts and lacerations from flying glass.

The bronze plaque was put up in 1996 alongside a water feature in part designed by local schoolchildren.

Speaking after it was discovered missing, Tim Parry's father Colin, 65, said of the thieves: ‘Even if they are really hard up it is without any justification.

‘It really upsets me that they have disfigured something which symbolises a horror which took place in our town and has been worked on by many local youngsters.

‘It leaves an awful taste in my mouth that they must have snuck in, in the middle of the night and just taken it without any regard for the people that suffered. They did not give a moment's thought to the significance of what they had just stolen. It is despicable.’

His wife Wendy, 54, said: ‘It’s really sad to think that anyone would even think about stealing or defacing a memorial of any kind. Tim and Johnathan had so much to live for and I wonder whether the person who stole the plaque ever gave them and the 56 other people injured a second thought.

‘It is a sign of the times, I suppose, but there are other ways to make money without hurting those who had the misfortune to be caught up in that dreadful day.’

The bombings triggered a campaign for peace, with Mr and Mrs Parry – who have two other children – working tirelessly to promote greater understanding between Britain and Ireland.

They set up a Peace Centre in the town and played an active role in the Peace Process in Northern Ireland, for which Mr Parry was given his OBE in 2004.

Tragically, the parents of Johnathan Ball never recovered from the death of their son and they split up shortly after the bomb blast. Johnathan’s father, Wilf Ball, 69, died from a suspected heart attack in 2004 and his body lay undiscovered for two days.

The boy’s mother, Marie Comerford suffered a fatal heart attack on the 16th anniversary of her son’s murder with the coroner saying she died of a broken heart.

The bronze plaque, which depicts the course of the River Mersey as it flows through the Borough of Warrington, reads: ‘The central water feature is in part a memorial to two local children who died following the terrorist bomb explosion in Bridge Street in 1993.  Young people helped the artist with the design work.’

Helen Jones, Labour MP for Warrington North, said: ‘This is a callous theft which shows no regard for the families involved or for other Warrington people who were injured in the bombing.

‘Warrington is very proud of the way it conducted itself after the bombings and the way it didn’t turn to hatred and instead worked constructively for peace. But these thieves have trashed the reputation of the town and ought to be ashamed of themselves.’

David Mowat, Conservative MP for Warrington South, said: ‘I am utterly disgusted by how low these mindless vandals have stooped.’

Liz Antrobus was 22 when she and her 29 year-old fiance Gordon Edwards were blown into the air by the blast of the second bomb.

They suffered horrendous injuries and spent months in hospital but were married in 1994 in a ceremony attended by bomb victim Tim Parry’s mother, Wendy.

There has been a rise in cases of criminals targetting war memorials, lead from church roofs
and cables from railway lines for their scrap value.

Each year, at least 
15,000 tons of the 13million tons of metal sent for scrap is believed to
be stolen, worth an estimated of £800million.
