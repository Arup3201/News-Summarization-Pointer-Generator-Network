It has only been used once in the last three years, but a red telephone box in a tiny fishing village will not be removed - after residents mounted a round-the-clock vigil to save it.

For nearly 30 years, the phone box in Kilmuir, on the Black Isle north of Inverness, was the community's only means of contact with the outside world and it has come to be cherished as a symbol of life in the Highlands.

So when BT decided it should go, the village's 100 residents threw a ring of steel around it.

Blocked: Villagers in Kilmuir, on the Black Isle north of Inverness, parked their cars around the red telephone box to stop BT removing it

Locals drew up a rota and took it in turns to park their vehicles around the payphone to prevent workmen from uprooting it.

Yesterday, people power won the day when BT relented and allowed the village to pay £1 to adopt the box – even though it has been disconnected.

Village association chairman John Hill, 68, said: ‘We were prepared to keep our campaign and vigil going for as long it took but thankfully we didn’t have to wait long for victory.

‘We will all happily chip in to pay for the upkeep but we don’t know if it will be reconnected.

‘It has been used only once in the past three years so it isn’t that vital. But it has affectionately become part of village life.’

The Kilmuir community was horrified last Friday when a truck carrying two phone booths arrived to take the box away.

Engineers stopped at a house in the village to ask for directions to the box.

Their request was politely declined and as word swept through the village, locals quickly surrounded the box with their cars to prevent anyone from touching it.

Posters were stuck on the windscreens warning anyone approaching that steps were being taken to prevent access to the box.

Plea: The residents fixed a message to the red telephone box, urging the company not to remove it

It read: ‘The community only heard of the threat to this local landmark on October 2, 2012, and steps are being taken to preserve it.

'Our immediate response has been to prevent access to the box with our own vehicles. We have informed the police of our actions.’

Mr Hill added: ‘We then discovered a notice pinned inside the box warning us we had 42 days to save it but since no one ever went inside the kiosk, we didn’t know about it until it was almost too late.’

Fellow resident Cathy McRae, 65, said: ‘The box used to sit in the middle of the row of houses overlooking the shoreline for years.

'Then one day about 30 years ago, it disappeared, only to mysteriously reappear for re-installation. The villagers chose the present location.

‘Although rarely used, it was an important lifeline for anyone spotting someone in trouble in the Firth to alert the emergency authorities.

‘We contacted our local councillors and met with the police as well as local BT management and explained our position.

‘We were told there was a phone box 400 metres away and this one was no longer required.

‘But BT didn’t know it was 400 metres away if you were prepared to scramble along the rocks to the village of North Kessock.’

A BT spokesman said: ‘We told Highland Council back in 2008 that we planned to remove it and no objections were raised.

‘A year later we launched our well-publicised Adopt-a-Kiosk campaign, giving local communities the chance to pay £1 to retain their red box and protect their heritage.’

Here to stay: The red telephone box had only been used once in three years and has now been disconnected, but villagers were determined that it should remain
