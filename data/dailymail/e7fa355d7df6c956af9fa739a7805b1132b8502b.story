Proudly collecting her degree with a friend by her side, Emma Watson looks as though she has achieved her aim of having a normal student experience.

But appearances can be deceiving...

For the fellow ‘student’ accompanying the actress to her graduation is actually an armed police guard. And beneath the undercover officer’s black graduation robe is a gun.

Protection: Emma Watson (centre) was accompanied by an undercover armed police guard (left) as she graduated from Brown University on Sunday

Extra security: The policewoman (left) wore a pink shirt and blue jeans, which her police badge was attached to, but she later blended in with the graduates by changing into a traditional cap and gown

Miss Watson’s high-security approach 
to her graduation ceremony at Brown University is a marked contrast with
 her stated aim of having a ‘normal’ experience as a student at the 
elite US college.

In the 
past, the 24-year-old has played down her celebrity status, claiming to 
have never been asked for an autograph on campus – a sign, she said, of 
her normality.

But as she 
picked up her degree in English Literature alongside 2,000 other 
graduates on Sunday, she remained in constant sight of the undercover 
officer.

Underneath her 
graduation gown, the guard wore a pink shirt, jeans and trainers – far 
more practical, no doubt, than Miss Watson’s strappy heels.

Looking on: The guard sat to Emma's right during the ceremony, while the star's mother Jacqueline Luesby sat to her left

Undercover: The policewoman looked just like a normal graduate in the traditional cap and gown

Proud: Emma's mother looked to be thoroughly enjoying the ceremony in Rhode Island

Graduation day: The guard kept a watchful eye on Emma's whereabouts as they strolled around the educational facility

Here she comes: The British actress, best known as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter movies, was among the 2,000 graduates receiving degrees from Brown University on Sunday

All smiles: Emma wore a slick of pillar box lipstick for the day which accentuated her beaming smile

Miss
 Watson’s mother Jacqueline Luesby was also present for her daughter’s 
graduation, which came after five years – and three enrolments – at 
university.

Miss Watson first enrolled at Brown in 2009, before dropping
 out to shoot the final Harry Potter film, in which she starred as the 
studious witch Hermione Granger.

Then,
 having transferred to Oxford University – where she would meet her 
current boyfriend Matt Janney, as well as former flame William Adamowicz
 –  for another go at it in 2011, she was cast in The Perks of Being a 
Wallflower and put her studies on hold once more.

Star appeal: The star enjoyed a laugh and a joke with her fellow graduates during the ceremony

Special day: The actress graduated from Brown University in Rhode Island on Sunday

Long time coming:  The 24-year-old started at Brown in 2009, the same year she was named the highest-grossing actress of the decade by the Guinness Book of World Records

What now? Emma will continue building on her flourishing film career having graduated from Brown University

Watson had a busy film career during her time as a student, releasing both parts of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, This is the End, and the recent Biblical epic Noah

Clever girl: Emma graduated with a bachelor's degree in English literature from the Ivy League university in Rhode Island

My moment: Emma joined her peers at the graduation in Rhode Island on Sunday

Brunette locks: When Emma wasn't wearing her cap, the star's tresses had a mind of their own

Home soil: Emma spent part of her degree studying in her native Britain at Oxford University

It
 was a role she could not refuse, having waited so long to land a 
‘grown-up’ part and being desperate for a chance to prove she could do 
more than the Harry Potter films.

But
 it would appear the third time is a charm for Miss Watson, who returned
 to Brown in January and has now completed her studies. Rebuking claims 
she would never graduate, Miss Watson said last month: ‘I don’t care. 
This is what I want. And graduating will, for me, be really symbolic of 
all of that.

She added: ‘I will be there. And I will be throwing a huge party. And getting very drunk.’

Big day: Watson, accustomed to treading red carpets, will today be one of 2,000 students walking across the podium to receive her degree in English literature from Brown

Happy day: Emma Watson flashes a million-dollar smile the moment she officially graduates from Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island
