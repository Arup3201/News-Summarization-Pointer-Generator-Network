An ornate scabbard chape belonging to Admiral Lord Nelson - discovered on the bed of the River Thames by a police diver in the 1970s - has surfaced at auction for £70,000.

It is believed the 6in long enamel and diamond decoration that fixed onto the bottom end of the naval hero's sword case was tossed into the water by thieves decades before.

It was discovered in 1973 purely by chance by a police diver searching for a weapon used in a crime.

The chape was from a scimitar sword presented to Nelson by the Sultan Selim III of the Turkish Empire to commemorate the British victory over the French fleet at the Battle of the Nile in 1798. 

It is decorated in diamonds with the star and crescent which matches the Ottoman Order of the Crescent granted to Nelson in 1799.

The locket no longer exists as it was melted down years ago but the chape is now coming up for auction in London with a pre-sale estimate of £50,000 to £70,000.

The one-armed naval hero (illustrated) was famed for his victories at sea, mostly notably the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar

Michael Moorcroft, of auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'The chape would have been a super-expensive item of the day.

'We can associate it with Nelson through the star and crescent at the centre of the decoration which matches the Ottoman Order of the Crescent conferred on Nelson in 1799 and as seen in a portrait of him in 1801.

'The sheer quality of workmanship that has gone into it is quite stunning.

'It is an object that is pretty fabulous.'

Five years before its discovery, an ornate locket with an identical decoration that was used on the top part of Nelson's scabbard was found during dredging work of the River Wey in Surrey.

The location wasn't far from the Thames at Windsor where the chape was found, nor from Nelson's palatial home at Merton.

Both discoveries were featured on BBC's Blue Peter.

Mr Moorcroft added: 'Both the locket and the chape were found at the bottom of rivers just five years and a few miles apart. The locket was found about 20 miles from Nelson's estate at Merton.

The chape is being sold by Bonhams on April 1.
