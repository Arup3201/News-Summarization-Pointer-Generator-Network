Food hygiene is so poor in more than 500 hospitals, care homes and nurseries that they have been ordered to take action to improve.

More than 250 kitchens require major or urgent improvement after being rated one-star or lower, the standard of hygiene usually associated with the worst kebab vans.

It raises fears that patients, children and the elderly risk illness from meals served by public service kitchens and sparks calls for urgent action to address the problem.

Under the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme, establishments preparing and serving food are given a star rating for hygiene.

Public health minister Jane Ellison said it 'provides transparency to consumers on hygiene standards in places where they eat or buy food'.

The best rated sites are given five stars and a named 'very good'. Four stars awarded for 'good' levels of hygiene, and three stars for being 'generally satisfactory'.

However, two stars mean improvement is required, one star means 'major improvement required' and zero stars suggests 'urgent action required'.

According to figures released in Parliament, more than 500 hospitals, childcare and caring premises have been given two or fewer stars.

The Food Standards Agency says its ratings scheme 'will help you choose where to eat out or shop for food'

It includes 242 given two stars, 255 one star and six given no stars at all. A further 1,467 are only 'generally satisfactory'. The ratings are awarded by council inspectors.

Luciana Berger, Labour's shadow public health minister, said: 'It is not acceptable that over 500 hospitals, childcare and caring premises have been told to improve their food hygiene.

'Everyone using these public services should have the right to expect food that has been prepared safely, in a clean environment.

'The Government must hold these premises to account on the urgent action they must now take to address these serious failings in standards.'

The Food Standards Agency says its ratings scheme 'will help you choose where to eat out or shop for food by giving you information about the hygiene standards in restaurants, pubs, cafes, takeaways, hotels, and other places you eat out'.

But people admitted to hospital will not have the same degree of choice, and most will be forced to eat the meals served or rely on friends and family to boy food from outside. 

A Department of Health spokesman said: 'These figures show 98.6 per cent of kitchens in hospitals and care facilities are performing well – the second highest number of all industries in the UK. However there are a small number that need to improve and we expect local services to take strong action on this.' 

At the inspection, the officer will check:

* how hygienically the food is handled – how it is prepared, cooked, re-heated, cooled and stored

* the condition of the structure of the buildings – the cleanliness, layout, lighting, ventilation and other facilities

* how the business manages what it does to make sure food is safe and so that the officer can be confident standards will be maintained in the future

The hygiene standards found at the time of inspection are then rated on a scale. 

At the bottom of the scale is '0' – this means urgent improvement is required. At the top of the scale is '5' – this means the hygiene standards are very good.
