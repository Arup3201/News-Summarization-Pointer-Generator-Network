British taxpayers face a legal bill of up to half a million pounds over a disastrous undercover Metropolitan Police investigation into corruption in the Caribbean.

Senior Scotland Yard officers were sent to the Cayman Islands and their inquiry eventually resulted in the arrest of a judge and suspension of two local police chiefs.

But there were no convictions, the judge and police chiefs sued successfully for damages and the Met team were nicknamed the ‘Sunshine Squad’ when pictures emerged of them relaxing on the beach during the failed two-year operation.

Seven years on, the now-retired policeman who led the probe, Martin Bridger, is still being sued in England and the Caymans – and The Mail on Sunday can reveal that his legal costs of up to £448,000 will be picked up by the public after the Met agreed to keep paying them.

Last night one insider said: ‘I’m astonished that the taxpayer is still paying for something like this after all these years.’

The debacle began back in September 2007 when the Foreign Office asked the Met to help investigate alleged corruption in the Cayman Islands, which is a British Overseas Territory.

A team from the elite Directorate of Professional Standards, posing as estate agents, was sent on the 4,800-mile trip to look into claims that a deputy police commissioner was leaking sensitive information to a local newspaper editor.

Detective Chief Inspector Bridger, who had been commander of Lambeth borough in South London, was Senior Investigating Officer.

In March 2008, a Briton serving in the Cayman police, Stuart Kernohan, was suspended and later sacked. Six months later Judge Alexander Henderson was arrested by the Yard team and his office and computer were searched.

Neither was ever charged with any offence, and British judge Sir Peter Cresswell ruled Judge Henderson’s arrest had been illegal. He was awarded $1 million damages.

In May 2009, Mr Bridger and his 12-strong team returned home. In October that year an auditor found ‘significant deficiencies’ in the management and accounting of the police investigation, with the cost to the Caymans put at £8 million.

Since then the case has descended into a blizzard of lawsuits involving Mr Bridger, Mr Kernohan and the Cayman authorities, with criminal complaints, misconduct claims and employment cases lodged.

A spokesman for the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime said: ‘Payments have been made amounting to £180,000 and authorisation has been given in respect of further costs up to £268,000. This financial assistance reflects the Metropolitan Police’s support to an officer in respect of legal proceedings arising out of an overseas posting.

‘This latest sum is conditional upon Mr Bridger taking steps to bring these matters to a swift conclusion.’

Speaking about the saga earlier this year, Mr Bridger said: ‘I have done nothing wrong other than trying to expose the truth and to defend myself as best as I can.’

Ann Barnes spent £15,000 on the 'Anne Force 1' van

A crime tsar has vowed to ditch the ‘presidential’ minibus that helped turn her into a national laughing stock.

Ann Barnes, Police and Crime Commissioner for Kent, spent £15,000 on a van that she decorated with the name ‘Ann Force 1’ – jokingly nicknamed after the US President’s personal jet Air Force One – as she toured the county meeting the public.

But she has decided to get rid of the van after it appeared in a documentary on her role, which left her the target of criticism from local politicians and police officers.

In an appearance before her local scrutiny board this week, Mrs Barnes said: ‘I will retire my van… sadly. The decision to retire it is a difficult one and I don’t know what I’m going to replace it with. But I do have to acknowledge that its reputation has been tarnished and I don’t want that to form the story and detract from the engagement with local people.’

However, she was surprised to discover that almost all members of the Kent Police and Crime Panel – who hold her to account – wanted her to keep it, saying it was a good way to let people know she was available to talk to.

Mrs Barnes was elected in 2012, having previously claimed that the £85,000 role was a waste of money. She gained notoriety last year after The Mail on Sunday revealed she had employed a foul-mouthed teenager, Paris Brown, as her ‘youth commissioner’.

The 17-year-old had to quit following controversy about offensive comments on Twitter.
