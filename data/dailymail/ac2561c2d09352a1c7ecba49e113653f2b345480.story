A Rugby League legend has spoken of his suicide attempt following a long battle with depression sparked by retirement from the sport he loves.

Sean Long, a fan favourite for St Helens and Great Britain, says he has struggled to cope since injury ended his playing days in 2011.

In January he took tablets and attempted to start his car in his closed garage but was saved by friends and family. He was sectioned but has since been released by doctors into the care of his mother Pamela and brother Karl.

Long has endured turbulent times both on the field and in his personal life. In 2009 he suffered severe nerve damage during surgery to
 repair a broken jaw in 2009 and in 2011 he got divorced from his wife Claire.

'I've got a face like a dropped pie,' he said in 
2010.

'It's getting better slowly but there's a lot of nerve damage. That's what's causing my face to drop a bit.

'I've
 got a machine to try to stimulate the nerves as well. It's ongoing and 
it's going to be slow but, as long as it doesn't stop me playing the 
game I love, I'm happy.

'I'm not bothered about having this face as long as I can play rugby.'

He was also banned from playing for three 
months in 2004 after placing a bet on his own side to lose, claiming 
he did not know it was against the rules.

Long's injuries forced him to retire in 2011. He is pictured during his stint at St Helens (left) and during the furore over betting against his own team in 2004

The 37-year-old, famed in his playing 
days for his instantly-recognisable blonde dreadlocks, was rescued when a friend who lives nearby was able to alert his mother and brother.

He says he is now recovering and trying to 
move forward with his life.

'It was a cry for help,' he said.

'It's
 only now that I'm learning to speak to people about what I was going 
through that I realise a lot of people have been in this situation 
before.'

He told the Sunday People: 'It's a big thing, depression - it gets hold of you. I'm glad I'm out the other side.'

Long won every honour in the domestic game during 12 years at St Helens and made his last Super League appearance for Hull in June 2011.

In 2000 he won rugby league's 'Man of Steel' award as player of the season.
