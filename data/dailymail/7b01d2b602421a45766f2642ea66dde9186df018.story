A missing Canadian cruise ship passenger is thought to have fallen overboard in the Cayman Islands, police say.

The unidentified 65-year-old man may have fallen into the sea around dawn on Tuesday about 13 miles northwest of Grand Cayman. 

The man's wife reported him missing on Tuesday morning as the Independence of the Seas ship - the biggest cruise ship in the world - prepared to dock at George Town Harbor.

The man is the second Canadian passenger to go missing from a Royal Caribbean ship in recent days.

Police interviewed staff and witnesses aboard the Royal Caribbean Cruises ship and were still investigating the disappearance of the senior.

In a statement, police said: â€˜The Port Authority broadcasted an appeal to all marine traffic to be on the lookout for the missing passenger.â€™

Tracy Quan, a spokeswoman for Miami-based Royal Caribbean Cruises, said the investigation was turned over to local authorities yesterday before the cruise ship departed and resumed its route. She said the man's wife disembarked in Grand Cayman.

Police said the wife told them they went to bed around 1 a.m. on Tuesday but that he was gone when she woke up about six hours later.

Authorities said they searched the 15-deck, 1,112-foot-long craft and reviewed closed-circuit camera footage before the ship departed. 

The ship is on a six-night cruise that departed Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Sunday and has port calls in Jamaica and Haiti. It can accommodate 4,375 guests and more than 1,300 crew members.

On Saturday, 26-year-old Tien Phuoc Nguyen jumped from the Adventures of the Seas near a tiny Puerto Rican island on the last night of a week-long Caribbean cruise with his family.

The U.S. Coast Guard ended its search for him on Monday.
