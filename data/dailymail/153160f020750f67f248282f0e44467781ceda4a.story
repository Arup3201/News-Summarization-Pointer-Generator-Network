White children are less likely to continue their eduction at university than any other ethnic group, official figures reveal. 

Fewer than 29 per cent leave school with the aim of starting an undergraduate course – compared with 57 per cent among Chinese children and 41 per cent of Asian pupils.

Black children – once the worst-performing ethnic group in schools – are now the third most ambitious, with an application rate of 34 per cent.

White children have long trailed behind Chinese and Asian pupils in terms of chasing university places. 

But the figures from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service show they have been bypassed by other groups.

They also come behind two wider categories used by Ucas – mixed race children (31 per cent), and all other ethnic groups (33 per cent). Ucas chief executive Mary Curnock Cook said: ‘Our new analysis of demand by ethnic group shows that white pupils at English schools now have the lowest application rate of any ethnic group. 

‘There has been significant growth in demand from black pupils.’ 

Chief schools inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw last month published a major report which found under-achievement is  now most pronounced among white working-class children in suburbs, market towns and seaside resorts.

Previously, black children from inner-city schools had presented the biggest problem. 

An anti-schools culture among white children has been blamed for a collapse in their academic performance.

Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said cultural difference might explain the different attitudes towards education.

‘New arrivals to this country are very keen to make use of the educational opportunities they didn’t necessarily have in their own countries,’ he added.

‘When it comes to British children – boys in particular – there are fixed expectations based on what their parents have achieved.  There is more of a view that university isn’t for them because they don’t come from that sort of background.’

White children still make up the majority of undergraduates because they are by far the largest ethnic group

White children still make up the majority of undergraduates because they are by far the largest ethnic group.

But the Ucas figures, which relate to 18-year-olds at state schools, show applications by white boys and girls have dropped for the last three years. The largest increase has been among black pupils, whose application rate has soared by 70 per cent since 2006.

Overall, around 44 per cent of school leavers apply to go to university. But there are significant differences between the sexes, with around 49 per cent of young women trying to get into higher education compared with only 37 per cent of men.

And while children from the most advantaged areas are 2.7 times more likely to seek a university education than those from deprived areas, the figure has fallen from 4.3 in 2004.

Successive governments have tried to widen applications and universities have been ordered to take more deprived students in return for charging higher tuition fees – triggering accusations of social engineering.

London had the highest application rate, at 41 per cent, compared with 31 per cent in the North East.
