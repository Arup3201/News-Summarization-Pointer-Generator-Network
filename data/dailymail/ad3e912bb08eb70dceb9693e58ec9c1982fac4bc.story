The popularity of Labour policies is being undermined by the fact just a quarter of voters think Ed Miliband is up to the job of being Prime Minister, a damning new poll reveals.

His plans to freeze energy bills, take on private landlords and consider renationalising the railways are backed by more than 60 per cent of people.

But in a fresh sign of the Labour leader’s image problem, just 14 per cent think he is a strong leader and many remain wary of handing the keys to Number 10.

The latest YouGov opinion poll shows how voters back many of Labour's flagship policies

Fewer than a quarter of voters think Mr Miliband is up to the job of being Prime Minister

Mr Miliband will use a major speech tonight on health in an attempt cut through on a key issue to voters.

But a new analysis by pollsters YouGov reveals that while his policies are popular with the majority of voters, Mr Miliband fails to impress.

The flagship promise to freeze gas and electricity bills for two years was unveiled by Mr Miliband at last year’s Labour conference.

It is supported by 69 per cent of voters, with 17 per cent opposed – a huge margin, according to a YouGov poll.

A recently-announced Labour plan aimed at the so-called Generation Rent to take on landlords is also popular.

Some 63 per cent of people back the idea of making standard tenancies last for three years and limiting the amount by which landlords can put up rents, only 19 per cent are against.

Taking on 
the railways is also popular. Mr Miliband has hinted that he is in 
favour of the state running more lines in the UK, a move backed by many 
of his MPs and the unions.

Sixty per cent of those surveyed back renationalising the railways, with just 20 per cent opposed.

Last week Mr Miliband promised a crack down on ‘ghost homes’ bought up by wealthy investors which then stand empty.

Labour would impose council tax premiums for properties which stand empty, an idea supported by 54 per cent of people.

However, none of this backing policy-by-policy is reflected in support for Mr Miliband.

Mr Miliband's boast that he more intellectually confident than Mr Cameron was rejected by voters

Only 14 per cent think he is a strong leader. Just 26 per cent think he makes it clear what he stands for and only 23 per cent say he is up to the job of Prime Minister.

The Labour lead in the headline polls also remains at between one and seven per cent.

YouGov’s Peter Kellner said: ‘Given the popularity of Miliband’s recent proposals, and the publicity he has gained for them, he and his party ought to be gaining ground. They are not.

‘Miliband has so far failed to convert enthusiasm for his policies into support for his leadership.’

Mr Miliband is said to be losing the battle on ‘valence’ issues identified by political scientists, including competence, honesty and strength of character.

‘Parties and their leaders can announce the world’s most popular policies; they will still lose if voters think they aren’t up to the job of governing Britain, or won’t keep their word, or will duck tough choices,’ Mr Kellner added.

In an interview last week Mr Miliband boasted of having more intellectual confidence than David Cameron.

The claim risked backfiring because he actually got a worse degree than Mr Cameron.

In fact, 50 per cent of people think Mr Cameron is more intellectually confident, while just 22 per cent said the same of Mr Miliband.
