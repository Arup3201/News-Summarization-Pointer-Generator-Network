A major new exhibition celebrating the life and work of Valentino will open at Somerset House on Thursday.

'Valentino: Master of Couture' will be a glamorous exhibition focusing exclusively on haute couture created by the legendary Italian designer.

With a 50 year career starting in the late 1950s this exhibition will showcase over 130 hand-crafted designs worn by icons such as Jackie Kennedy Onassis, Grace Kelly, Sophia Loren and Gwyneth Paltrow.

A prophetic designer and creator of exquisite, beautiful clothes, this is Valentino as he has never been seen before.

Featuring dresses from the couture catwalk and red carpet as well as designs commissioned by private clients, this exhibition brings together a comprehensive collection of couture, much of which has never been seen outside the Valentino atelier.

The exhibition will give visitors a rare glimpse behind the closed doors of Valentino’s world, allowing them to experience the thrill of walking the runway and reveal Valentino’s craftsmanship.

Red carpet style: Jennifer Aniston is another fan of the designer and wore this gown to the premiere of her film Along Came Polly

'Each of these designs have a beautiful story,' says Valentino.

'The atelier crafted each so diligently by hand, taking hours, sometimes days to complete.

'The details are incredibly intricate, though outside the runway shows and events, the dresses have rarely been seen, so to be able to showcase these designs at Somerset House, where they can be seen in great detail by the public, is very unique.'

Known for his long-standing relationships with the world’s most glamorous women, Valentino has designed for princesses, first ladies and Hollywood icons.

Speaking to Grazia magazine he said: 'When I first started there was only haute couture.

'I love the perfection of haute couture. I know the construction of each dress like the back of my hand.'
