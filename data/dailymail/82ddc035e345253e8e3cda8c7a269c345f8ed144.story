The image of the woodpecker giving a small weasel a lift on its back became an internet sensation and went viral around the globe.   

The emergence of photographer Martin Le-May's incredible snapshot has sparked dozen of hilarious memes parodying his work.

Fans went to town creating their own versions of the image using a number of famous faces, including Miley Cyrus in her infamous wrecking ball get-up, Madonna and Chelsea captain John Terry.

Characters from the likes of Toy Story and Lord of the Rings were also featured in entertaining send-ups, as were world leaders such as Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong-un.

This is not the first time that the online world has united in creating comical ways of lampooning a picture. Hours after Kim Kardashian posted the image of her oiled-up derriere the internet reacted in force.

Most recently the two tone dress was given the meme treatment, with people creating graphics to mock the internet's fascination with the dress.
