Looking for the Easter bunny? Here’s one that’s easy to spot.

Darius weighs three-and-a-half stone and measures 4ft 4in, making him the world’s biggest rabbit, according to Guinness World Records.

His owner, Annette Edwards, 62, from Worcester, is considering putting him on a diet after revealing that he eats 12 carrots a day – more than 4,000 a year.

He also gets through piles of cabbage, apples and two large bowls of rabbit mix - at an annual cost of £2,400.

Ms Edwards is well used to looking after bunnies with big appetites as Darius’s mother Alice held the record title before him.

And Ms Edwards couldn’t believe the speed Darius grew at when he was born – and she never thought after just five years he would hold the crown for biggest rabbit in the world.

'Darius is from a family of 
giant rabbits but he is the biggest bunny in history. It’s amazing just 
how big he is.

‘If Darius had his way he would never stop eating,’ she said. ‘He is very greedy. I have to really watch him.

‘He
 has a great personality and so I can’t be too angry when he is trying 
to sneak more food… 

Darius' owners say he has a great personality and so gets away with sneaking extra snacks

Owner Annette Edwards, 62, from Worcester says if the greedy creature had his way, he'd eat all day

As the bunny's birthday is in April, the family say he really is the real-life Easter Bunny

'Darius eats me out of house and home but he is very
 active which is good for his health.’

‘Luckily he likes to hop around all the time. I had to put a child gate on the stairs to stop him going up there.

'I treat him like a dog. He even sits on the sofa with me to watch TV.

‘People love coming round to  see Darius – he is 
bigger than most dogs.

'The family all love him and he has a mischievous
 glint in his eye.’

‘He really is the real-life Easter bunny, as his birthday is in April and it always falls around Easter.

‘There is no secret to growing the 
world’s biggest rabbit. I 
treat him really well and indulge him in the odd carrot or 12.’

Continental giant rabbits usually live to four or five years, but can last up to seven if well cared for.

They
 are considered docile, friendly and intelligent, and are relaxed around
 humans if socialised when young. They were originally bred for their 
meat and fur.
