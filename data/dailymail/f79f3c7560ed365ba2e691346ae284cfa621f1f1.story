A father was left with a three-inch gash to his head after being attacked by a neighbour’s cat because it hated his aftershave.

Ian Olver, 44, who works as a plasterer, splashed on the Hugo Boss Bottled Night scent after it was given to him by his wife Hayley, 40, as a Christmas present.

He put it on for the first time on Saturday before he went to see his neighbours, Mark and Lorraine Bawden.

Ian Olver, 44, from Plymouth, Devon, was left needing hospital treatment after his neighbour's cat attacked him because of the aftershave he was wearing

The 44-year-old plasterer was left with a three inch gash to his head after the pet cat clawed at him because it hated his Hugo Boss aftershave

But the unsuspecting father-of-two had no idea that their pet cat Blue had a phobia of strong scents.

The normally-placid cat leapt up at Ian and began clawing at his neck and ears as soon as it smelt his eau de toilette.

He managed to fight off the animal but was left with a three inch gash to the back of his head which required hospital treatment and a tetanus injection.

Mr Olver, of Plymouth, Devon, said: 'I’m normally a cheap and cheerful sort of bloke so its rare that I’ll be wearing a posh aftershave but this was a Christmas present.

'I put on two or three squirts before going out but it wasn’t as though it was overpowering.

'But as soon as I was inside the cat leapt up off table and landed on the back of my head.

'I managed to fling it off but it jumped up to have another go. This time I managed to knock it away with my shoulder.

'It was only then that I touched the back of my head and saw my hand was covered in blood.

'It was so bad my wife called a paramedic out and then took me to hospital to have my cut glued together.

'I don’t have any animosity towards the cat I just think it had a really bad reaction to the aftershave. I thought it was a nice smell - but obviously the cat didn’t agree.'

Mark and Lorraine Bawden reared three-year-old black and white cat Blue by hand after he was rejected by his mother when he was a newborn kitten.

The animal-loving couple, who have four cats, two dogs and several tarantulas, say Blue has never attacked anyone before but does react strangely to odours.

Mr Bawden, 38, who is a carer, said: 'Blue wasn’t allowed to come into contact with anyone for the first six months of his life because his immune system didn’t work.

Mark Bawden, Blue the cat's owner, said: 'He does have have a few issues and one of them is that he's very sensitive to smell'

'So he does have have a few issues and one of them is that he’s very sensitive to smell.

'He goes ballistic if he gets a whiff of tobacco for example. He’ll lick your fingers and roll onto his back as if it’s catnip.

'It’s the exact opposite with Vaseline, he absolutely hates it and will run off.'

Lorraine, 38, added: 'We normally ask people what deodorant they’ve got on.

'If we buy any new perfumes or aftershaves I normally spray them on a card to see if he likes them.

Father-of-two Ian, of Plymouth, Devon, said: 'I don't have any animosity towards the cat I just think it had a really bad reaction to the aftershave. I thought it was a nice smell - but obviously the cat didn't agree'

'This was totally out of character, he normally runs off when he doesn’t like something.

'He’s the cuddliest, most lovely cat we have and he’s never attacked anyone before - its just Ian and his expensive aftershave.'

Launched in 2010, Hugo Boss Bottled Night is billed as an aromatic fragrance which 'abounds in intense and masculine woody accords' with hints of lavender, birch tree and African violet.

Leading animal psychologist Dr Roger Mugford said Blue may have perceived the aftershave as a threat.

The cat, which has a phobia of strong smells, attacked Mr Olver supposedly because he was wearing the Hugo Boss Bottled Night scent, pictured above

He said: 'It’s possible the cat may have attacked as a result of the perfume.

'Cats identify people by their smells and he may have seen the scent as a threat.

'This has happened in the past with both dogs and cats though dogs are more visual than cats, they don’t rely on their sense of smell as much.

'I would think that for this little cat the best thing for the man to do would be to go in with a treat as a peace offering.'

Hugo Boss declined to comment.
