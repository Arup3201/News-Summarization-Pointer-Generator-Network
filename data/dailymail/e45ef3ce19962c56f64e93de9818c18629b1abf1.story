Nervous postmen are refusing to deliver to a block of flats unless they are escorted by a band of female pensioners.

Royal Mail will only bring post to the 100 flats on three days a week – instead of the usual six – and even then, will only deliver through letterboxes if a 69-year-old female councillor is stood at the postman’s side.

His van downstairs, meanwhile, is watched by two ageing female residents of the block in case its tyres are slashed.

Councillor Maria Linforth-Hall, 69, escorts the postman around the building after Royal Mail refused to make deliveries at the block of flats 

The bizarre arrangement began six months ago after a 34-year-old woman living in the flats was accused of assaulting a postman, as well as sending threatening emails to Royal Mail.

Ironically, the building – Rowland Hill flats near Waterloo in central London – has the same name as the man who invented the penny black stamp and effectively created the modern postal service.

Royal Mail initially refused to deliver there at all, forcing residents to take a bus to the nearest sorting office.

Maria Linforth-Hall, a local Lib Dem councillor, complained – and eventually offered to act as a guard three days a week along with volunteers from the flats.

Now every Monday, Wednesday and Friday a band of pensioners waits outside to ‘police’ the deliveries.

Southwark Council has complained to regulator Ofcom in the hope of forcing Royal Mail to reinstate a proper service.

Mrs Linforth-Hall said: ‘We are hoping that it will be back to normal, but they are saying that it is unsafe without me or my fellows there to assist.’

Her husband Tony, a former advertising boss who is also 69, sometimes helps with the escort.

He said residents are angry about the reduced service, adding: ‘I spoke to a guy waiting for a hip operation who could miss it as a result of not getting his post immediately.’ 

The woman at the centre of the row, council tenant Rachel O’Connor, alleged that it was the postman who attacked her in a lift rather than the other way round.

Police took no further action due to a lack of evidence. But a source claimed the ‘assault’ involved nothing more than Miss O’Connor pushing the postman and the postman pushing her back. 

Southwark Council said it was ‘working with’ its tenant, who had apologised and signed an ‘acceptable behaviour contract’.

Nicola Blake, the local delivery office manager, wrote in a recent letter to residents: ‘Royal Mail are unable to recommence a full mail delivery service.

Rowlands Hill House near Waterloo. Southwark Council say they are working with the tenant to allow deliveries to begin again 

‘In November 2012 a resident sent a series of complaints to the Royal Mail which became increasingly abusive and threatening ... in June 2014 the resident assaulted our delivery officer in the lifts. In December the tyres on our vehicle were slashed ... whilst this may be coincidental I am sure you will understand our concerns.’

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police confirmed it had investigated assault claims but that no one was charged.

Miss O’Connor was unavailable for comment.
