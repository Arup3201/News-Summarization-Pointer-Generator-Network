World heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko stepped away from preparing for his bout with Bryant Jennings by taking his three month baby daughter Kaya for a walk with fiance Hayden Panettiere.

The couple were pictured on Saturday for the first time bringing their daughter out for a walk in Nashville, Tennessee. 

The 38-year-old Klitschko, from Ukraine, would have undoubtedly enjoyed the calm moments with his young family as his training intensifies for facing Jennings, an opponent he admitted he respects.

'I do have great respect for Bryant Jennings and his achievements,' Klitschko said of his next opponent, who has 19 wins and nine knock-outs from 19 bouts. 'He has good movement in the ring and good technique. I know this will be a tough challenge.'

Klitschko also revealed his excitement to return to New York and Madison Square Garden, the venue for the encounter.

'I am extremely happy to fight in New York again,' Klitschko said. 'I had my first unification fight here and a lot of great heavyweight matches have taken place at Madison Square Garden.'

Klitschko has 63 career victories, with an astounding 54 coming through knock-outs.

When he steps into the ring against Jennings on April 25, he will become the joint record-holding fighter with most heavyweight title fights with 27, alongside the legendary Joe Louis.
