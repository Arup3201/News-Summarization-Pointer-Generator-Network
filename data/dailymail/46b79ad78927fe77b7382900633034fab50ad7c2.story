Clay celebrated his reconciliation with his better half, Gina D'Agostini, by posting on social media a risque photo of the married couple in bed Tuesday.

The saucy snapshot showing Clay lying on top of his topless wife was accompanied by the caption: 'Jumped to a conclusion that wasn't true ..can't judge a situation without knowing all the facts ..I apologize ..'

Reconciled: Former Oklahoma Sooners running back Brennan Clay posted this racy photo depicting him on top of his wife, to whom he apologized for accusing her of cheating on his with a Dallas Cowboys star 

Change of heart: Clay tweeted Tuesday that his accusations of infidelity against his wife and his former teammate were baseless 

Earlier this month, Clay publicly accused D'Agostini of cheating on him with college teammate and Dallas Cowboys star DeMarco Murray, posting what he claims are intimate text messages between the two to Twitter. 

Clay's about-face regarding his wife's alleged affair came just days after the newlywed husband wrote a cryptic message on Twitter saying how everyone deserves a second chance, himself included.

The former Sooners player kept mum Wednesday on what has made him change his mind about the infidelity allegations, which reportedly had been based on his wife's intimate correspondence with a man Clay publicly identified as Marco.  

Daily Mail has reached out to both men for comment on social media Wednesday. 

Clay, 22, played alongside Murray, 26, for the University of Oklahoma Sooners in the 2010 season, but announced to the world this week that his wife of just five months, Gina D'Agostini, is having an affair with Murray.

Taking it a step further earlier this month, Clay revealed explicit texts he allegedly found in his wife's phone, including one about the two having sex in his own bed, according toGawker.

Clay said the text conversation happened on October 5, once he left to go to training for the San Diego Chargers.

After saying goodbye to Clay at the airport, D'Agostini appears to text Murray, saying that her 'roomate(sic)' has gone.

Clay claims his wife disguised Murray's number in her phone by saving it under 'Spray Tan'.

'So I can f--- u in your bed now?' Murray allegedly wrote back.

'Is that where you want to f--- me? And yes,' D'Agonstini allegedly replied.

To further prove his point, Clay also posted another screen shot of his wife's phone, showing the 'Spray Tan' number to have an area code of Las Vegas, where Murray is from. 

His online rant first started on Sunday, saying he found more than 50 'inappropriate' texts. 

'So Demarco Murray was having an affair with my wife...I'm done...' Clay wrote  to his nearly 25,000 followers.

Clay did not specify how long he believes his wife and the NFL player were together, nor did he say whether the affair has ended.

However, he did offer a couple of reasons their alleged affair is so wrong.

'1 has a baby momma and she has 2 kids,' he wrote. Michigan native D'Agostini does not have children with Clay. Murray has a baby with former Passions actress Heidi Mueller.

Clay failed to mention what might make such an affair so painful for him, besides the obvious feeling of betrayal: he and D'Agostini have been married just five months according to a Facebook profile that appears to belong to Clay.

Clay did not fail to convey how he feels about the alleged breach of trust, however.

'I'm disgusted...' Clay wrote, before heading off for some spiritual consolation.

'On that note headed to church,' he tweeted before his account went silent for a few hours.

Brennan Clay played for the Sooners for four seasons starting in 2010, Murray's last year on the team, the New York Post reports.

He went on to go to training camp with the Broncos but was let go in August.

His more successful former teammate Murray was selected in the third round of the 2011 draft by the Cowboys, where he remains today.

Murray had not responded to the accusations as of Sunday evening. 

D'Agostini makes a living as a fitness instructor in Dallas, according to her Facebook page.
