Fighter: Aimee Copeland, 24, has been upgraded to 'good' condition by doctors as her battle against the flesh-eating bacteria continues

A Georgia woman battling an extremely painful flesh-eating disease is showing definitive signs of improvement, as doctors have once again upgraded her condition.

Hospital officials said Monday that Aimee Copeland's condition has improved from serious to good, meaning that her vital signs are stable and within normal limits.

The 24-year-old woman developed necrotizing fasciitis after cutting her leg in a fall May 1 from a homemade zip line over a west Georgia river.

Her left leg, right foot and both hands have been amputated.

Her father, Andy Copeland, said in a blog post Monday that she was able to leave her hospital room and get outdoors for the first time during her stay at Doctors Hospital in Augusta.

Mr Copeland said he pushed his daughter around the outside of the hospital over the weekend.

He wrote: 'Aimee got a huge dose of [daylight] yesterday. For the first time in 49 days, Aimee got up in a wheelchair and rolled out of her hospital room... Fresh scenery and close proximity to nature was all she needed.'

While Mr Copeland admits that it hasn't been easy, he is amazed by her quick recovery and her positive spirit.

He wrote: 'I was and I am in awe of my incredible daughter. She has embraced her new life as a challenge and an opportunity. Perhaps all this was preordained.'

Earlier this month, Mr Copeland said his daughter had been enduring the worst pain of the ordeal.

In fact, her agony had become so overwhelming that she began taking morphine after initially refusing medication.

But now, as Miss Copeland's condition improves, she says she feel's 'blessed,' according to her father.

On
June 17, Mr Copeland wrote on his blog: 'Over the past 48 hours, Aimee 
has had the most difficult pain sheâ€™s experienced through her entire 
ordeal.'

Agony: Aimee Copeland had hoped to be treated with only holistic medicine but the extent of her injuries were too severe

Mr Copeland said the painkillers were
not enough to block his 24-year-old daughter's severe pain, which had 
spread beyond her amputation sites.

But today, she is only reporting pain in her abdominal area.

Earlier this month, doctors upgraded 
her condition to serious from critical after Miss Copeland fought back 
from the brink of death.

The
student had originally indicated that she felt a 'traitor to her 
convictions' by using drugs to manage her pain, because she believed in 
holistic medicine.

Prayers: Aimee Copeland's father says he is amazed by his daughter's attitude as she progresses

Describing his daughter's phantom pains on the blog on June 6, Mr Copeland wrote: 'Although she has no hands, her brain
is apparently still telling her body that the hands are there.

'I asked 
her if she could describe the pain and she told me, "It feels like I 
have been carrying bags of rocks".

The
University of West Georgia student had to have her left leg amputated 
at the hip, her right foot and both hands in order to save her life 
after a cut to her leg became infected.

The bacteria that attacked Miss Copeland's wound released a toxin that destroys skin, muscle and a layer of tissue below the skin known as fascia, her father said.

Despite the painful skin grafts, the student has crossed several milestones in recent weeks. She can breathe on her own and no longer needs dialysis.

Mr Copeland wrote that support for his daughter has come from all over the country, including celebrities like Sophia Vergara, Katie Couric and Ann Curry.

Andy Copeland's blog has 
been an inspiration to many all over the world who admire the strength 
and courage of the 24-year-old and her family.

Progress: Aimee Copeland's condition has now been changed from serious to good at the Georgia hospital

Miss Copeland has 
improved incredibly rapidly with the support of her family and 
well-wishers who have made donations on the website Mr Copeland set up 
for his brave daughter.

She was able to ask for ice-cream, and let her family know when she was bored and wanted a book to read.

Miss Copeland suffered a deep gash in her leg after falling from the zip line over a Georgia river, and the bacteria took hold in the wound.

Doctors at the local emergency room in
Carrollton closed the wound with nearly two dozen staples, but it 
became infected within days.

On
May 4, she was diagnosed with the rare infection and flown 200 miles to
Augusta for treatment by specialists at Doctors Hospital.

The
flesh-eating bacteria, Aeromonas hydrophila, emit toxins that cut off 
blood flow to parts of the body. The affliction can destroy muscle, fat 
and skin tissue.

Less than a month ago, doctors gave her
little chance of survival, but she became increasingly alert, despite 
several major operations, but she is likely to remain hospitalised for several more months.

'This
doctor can't fathom a reason for why she's improved the way she has,' 
Mr Copeland said. 'Her spirits are extraordinarily high. I am absolutely
amazed.'
