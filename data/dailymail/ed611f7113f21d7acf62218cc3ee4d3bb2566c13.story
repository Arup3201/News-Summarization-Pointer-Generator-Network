A mother has described the moment she battled to save the life of her 19-month-old son as he choked to death on a lollipop.

Tyler Stanton was sucking the sweet when he ran from the bathroom and 'launched himself' onto the sofa which caused it to become lodged in his throat.

An inquest heard his mother Zoe Jones, 23, desperately tried to clear the toddler's airway but only managed to snap the stick clean off.

Tyler's grandfather then tried to resuscitate the youngster using CPR as an ambulance rushed to the house in Rushall, West Midlands.

Paramedics arrived at the scene and used an emergency defibrillator in a bid to revive the toddler after he lost consciousness.

But sadly nothing could be done to save Tyler, who was pronounced dead at Walsall Manor Hospital on April 26 last year.

Sandwell Coroners Court was told a post-mortem found the remains of the lollipop still lodged in the back of his throat and the child's lungs had collapsed.

Mother-of-two Miss Jones, who now lives in Bloxwich, West Midlands, told the inquest of the moment she fought to save her child.

She said: 'He came running in from the bathroom with the lollipop in his mouth and he then launched himself onto the settee.

'I didn't see it happen, but my friend Emma shouted "quick, he's choking". We tried to get the lollipop out but just the stick came out, the rest was still in his mouth.

'I got the stick out but the rest wasn't attached - it was attached at first then when we pulled the stick it came off. I panicked.

'I called for an ambulance straight away as Tyler couldn't breathe. And the sweet was still stuck at that time. Tyler had no health problems. He was able to run and walk about. He was lively.'

The tragedy occurred while family and friends were visiting Miss Jones, Tyler and her four-year-old daughter in the home they shared with Tyler's father Greg Stanton, 23.

A post-mortem examination also found a brown-like liquid in the back of his throat, which was likely to be regurgitated gastric fluid.

A report, which was read out in open court, said that Tyler was 'normally grown for his age' and was also 'fit and healthy'.

The pathologist also found no evidence of any head traumas or abnormalities.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Black Country Coroner Robin Balmain gave the medical cause of death as airway obstruction due to a foreign body.

He said: 'This is a tragedy. This little boy has had an accident and that is what shall be reflected in my conclusion.'

Addressing Miss Jones, he added: 'I'm really sorry this has happened to you. I can't imagine what you were going through at the time.'

Miss Jones did not want to comment after the hearing but her stepmother, who didn't want to be named, added: 'I saw him all the time.

'He was a healthy little boy. I cannot believe it happened to him - it's not yet sunk in.'
