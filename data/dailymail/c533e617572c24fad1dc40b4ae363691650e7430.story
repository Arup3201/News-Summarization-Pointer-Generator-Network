Just two days before Chelsea Leonard gave birth to her first child, her world fell apart.

The expectant mother, excited at her impending arrival, was devastated when doctors told her she had stomach cancer.

Less than a year later - and three weeks after she married partner Matthew - she lost her life after a precious few months with Willow Grace.

Mrs Leonard, 26, died two weeks before she could celebrate her daughter's first birthday.

Chelsea Leonard, 26, died after an 11-month battle with stomach cancer, three weeks after marrying partner Matthew, and just two weeks before their daughter Willow celebrated her first birthday

Miss Leonard was diagnosed with the disease two days before baby Willow Grace was born last July

But she lost her battle knowing her longed-for daughter would grow up in the first home she bought with her husband.

Mr Leonard, a litigation lawyer, is now raising money in memory of his wife, who he described as 'gorgeous and popular, with a smile that could light up a room'.

It was last July, when she was 37 weeks pregnant, that the couple got the terrible news. 

During her pregnancy, Mrs Leonard had complained of suffering repeated dizzy spells.

Doctors initially said the symptoms were the result of her expecting a baby. But a blood test revealed she had a very low iron count.

A scan then found a tumour lurking in Mrs Leonard's stomach. 

Two days later baby Willow was born, and her mother began her fight to survive. 

But to the couple's horror, further scans revealed the disease had already spread to her liver. 

Mr Leonard, 32, said: 'If I can bring Willow up to be half as strong, considerate, brave and kind-hearted as Chelsea, I'll have done a good job.

'Once she knew the cancer was terminal, she took the view she just had to get on with it. 

'She focused on spending as much time with Willow as she possibly could - she stayed strong for her.' 

She had suffered dizzy spells during her pregnancy, but doctors had put the symptoms down to her expecting a baby. But when a blood test revealed she had a low iron count, she was referred for a scan which showed a tumour in her stomach. After Willow's birth further scans revealed the cancer had spread to her liver 

Stomach cancer is a relatively rare form of the disease, affecting around 7,300 people in the UK each year.

The early symptoms are vague and easy to mistake for other, less serious conditions.

They include:

As the disease develops, more advanced symptoms include:

In many cases, due to the face the early symptoms are so similar to other conditions, the disease is often advanced by the time it is detected.

It is vital people suffering the early symptoms get checked by their GP as soon as possible.

There are different types of stomach cancer - 95 per cent of cases develop in the cells of the stomach lining - known as adenocarcinoma of the stomach.

Less common forms of the disease include lymphoma of the stomach, which develops in the lymphatic tissue and gastrointestinal stromal tumours, which develop in the muscle of the stomach wall.

Around 15 per cent of stomach cancer patients live at least five years after diagnosis, and around 11 per cent live for 10 years.

In the UK around 5,000 people die from stomach cancer each year.

The couple met in 2004 while both working at Sheffield law firm Irwin Mitchell.

Mr Leonard then proposed on the first night they spent together in the house they bought in Ulley, Rotherham, where he is now raising Willow on his own.

He added: 'We wanted to get a house in a nice area for Willow to grow up in, and so Chelsea could be comfortable in the knowledge we had got off on the right foot in our home.'

The couple tied the knot in June in front of 150 friends and family at Aston Hall, near Sheffield.

But less than a month later Mrs Leonard passed away.

'Chelsea enjoyed the wedding day but she was really struggling with pain at that point,' Mr Leonard said.

'She put on a brave face and looked stunning. 

'She had to keep going for rests, but we spaced out the day a little so it was as relaxing as it could be for her.' 

Mrs Leonard, who grew up in Killamarsh, near Sheffield,  lost her own mother to cancer as a child.

She had repeated bouts of chemotherapy and agreed to take part in a clinical test to contain or reduce the size of the tumours.

The treatment was showing promise, until  her last trial scan, which showed the tumour in her liver had suddenly grown.

Over time, the cancer spread to her bones.

At her weakest point, she was admitted to specialist cancer centre The Christie Hospital in Manchester.

Her husband, who is making memory boxes  for Willow, so she will know what her mother was like, said: 'It's been really difficult but I've had no time to wallow.

'I've got to get up every morning to look after Willow, who is a positive focus.

'But I'll always think about what might have been if the cancer was detected earlier, and what we would be doing if she was still here now.'

More than 300 people attended Mrs Leonard's funeral, including family, friends and colleagues from Irwin Mitchell, where she worked as a legal clerk from the age of 17.

Workmates will be taking part in the Great Yorkshire Run on Sunday to raise money for the The Christie Hospital.
