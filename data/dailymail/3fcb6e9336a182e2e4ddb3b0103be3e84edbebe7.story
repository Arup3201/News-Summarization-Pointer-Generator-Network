Racegoers are used to surprise finishes but it's not often that a seagull steals the show.

But one determined bird swooped down to claim second place in dramatic fashion during the 19.10 at Brighton.

With the riders edging toward the post, the bird suddenly appeared and a photo finish revealed it had actually finished second.

This is the incredible moment a photo finish revealed a top jockey was pipped at the post into third place - by a seagull

Tuesday's race was actually won by 7/2 by favourite Jewelled, ridding by Richard Hughes. Luke Morris, riding Sagesse came in second at the East Sussex racecourse, despite being just edged by the seagull.

Spokesperson George Hill said: 'In all my years of racing, I’ve never seen a finish quite like that before.

'I don’t know what the odds are of that happening, but the bookies still gave Sagesse its proper result.

The bird swooped down to clinch second spot by a beak after it photo-bombed the dying seconds of the 19.10 at Brighton racecourse (stock picture) on Tuesday

'We are about a mile-and-a-half from the sea, and there are a lot of seagulls around, but this has never happened before as far as we are aware.

'The bird just happened to be in the right place at the right time, and was captured on Event Image’s photo finish.'
