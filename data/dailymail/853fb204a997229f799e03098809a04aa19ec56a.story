The last cuckoo in England flew out of the country yesterday . . . in her own seat on a British Airways jet.

Idemili had been found on the verge of death and while she was being treated by wildlife experts the rest of the cuckoo population set off on their annual migration.

Yesterday she was being taken first class to Italy so she can catch up with the rest of the flock before flying across the Mediterranean and heading for the Congo.

High flyer: Idemili the cuckoo, who was found close to death in Surrey, tucks into a
grub after being nursed back to health. She was flown plane to 
Turin, Italy, where she will continue her journey to the Congo

Cuckoos tend to leave England during 
July or early August. Idemili had set off for her epic migration from 
Brechfa Forest in Carmarthenshire, Wales, with four male companions but 
soon found herself in trouble.

She made it only as far as Tolworth in
Surrey, where she was discovered the worse for wear in a garden, 
malnourished and emaciated.

The two-year-old bird weighed only two
ounces – her ideal weight is about five ounces – and was not even 
strong enough to carry the lightweight GPS tag which ornithologists use 
to track birds’ movements.

She also had a badly pecked head, damaged feathers and a closed-up eye after being attacked several times by  other birds.

The cuckoo was taken to the Wildlife 
Aid Foundation a few miles away in Leatherhead, where she received 
emergency treatment and her tracker tag was removed.

And yesterday, following a successful 
recovery and an appeal from the foundation for support, her journey was 
under way once again, with BA flying her to Turin.

First Class: Idelia is placed inside her cabin complete with inflight 
refreshments. She was flown to Turin on a British Airways flight 
from where it is hoped she can continue her flight to the Congo

She was travelling in her own seat – a
business class one would have cost £379 if booked yesterday – and was 
accompanied on the flight from Gatwick by vet nurse Lucy Kells from 
Wildlife Aid.

Idemili was then due to spend a day recuperating before being released.

She will cross the Mediterranean and 
then the Sahara desert – this time under her own wing power – reuniting 
with her fellow migrating cuckoos before finally arriving in the Congo.

A Wildlife Aid Foundation spokesman 
said: ‘We’re excited about her journey continuing, it’s almost like her 
own  personal marathon with the help of BA.

‘It’s stunning that there has been such an amazing response to the aid of just one bird. The support has poured in.’

A British Airways spokesman said: ‘We are very proud to be supporting this little cuckoo.

‘We are glad we can help Idemili complete her winter migration after all.’
