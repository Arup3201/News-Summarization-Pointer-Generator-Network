A Labour MP campaigning against Scottish independence was egged by nationalists today.

Shadow international development secretary Jim Murphy was speaking in Kirkcaldy as part of his '100 Towns in 100 Days' tour for the Better Together campaign against independence.

Mr Murphy was hit on his back by the egg as he stood on his soapbox in the Fife town, which is home to the former Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

The police today confirmed they were investigating the incident, which left Mr Murphy covered in egg yolk.

A spokesman for Police Scotland confirmed: ‘Police were informed of a gathering at the Mercat, Kirkcaldy, this afternoon, and around 3.30pm received a report of a disturbance where a number of eggs were thrown. Enquiries are ongoing into this matter.’

A spokesman for Yes Scotland condemned the egg attack today.

He said: ‘There is no place for attacks - be they abuse, graffiti, vandalism or physical assault - in this campaign and we have been at pains to impress on everyone, on both sides of the debate, to treat others with respect at all times.’

Mr Murphy later Tweeted that he did not have a spare shirt with him and would have to attend another rally in his egged clothes

Better Together said it would be inappropriate to comment because the incident was now a police matter.

But Mr Murphy later tweeted: ‘Now off to another #indyref debate in Glasgow. Might look scruffier than usual but the egg stains aren't mine #WishI'dBroughtASpareShirt".’

Today's attack came after the former Prime Minister Gordon Brown was heckled by a nationalist protester while giving a speech urging voters to reject independence in Dundee.

Mr Murphy later tweeted that he wished he had brought a spare shirt in a light hearted tweet after the attack

Mr Murphy was confronted by nationalists campaigning for independence in next month's referendum

Mr Brown was labelled ‘an absolute disgrace’ by pro-independence supporter Mike Barile after delivering a rallying call for the Union alongside Alistair Darling.

Mr Barile, a Labour supporter who was struck off as a teacher for assaulting two pupils, shouted ‘rubbish’ before he was removed from the Dundee meeting half way through the Labour MP’s address.

Earlier today, shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander was verbally abused by a caller to BBC Radio Scotland's Morning Call programme.
