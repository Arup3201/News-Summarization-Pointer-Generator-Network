The 25 Barcelona players at St George's - minus Alex Song, who left the trip on Monday for personal reasons - strolled out in sunshine and after doing some light jogging broke into three groups.

The goalkeepers, including new signing Mark-Andre Ter Stegen practised shot stopping, while the outfield players went through quick passing drills in two circles.

Head coach Luis Enrique, the only one in shades, stood observing, addressing his assistants.
