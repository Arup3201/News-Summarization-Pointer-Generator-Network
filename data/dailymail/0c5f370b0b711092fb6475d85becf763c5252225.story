Ministers must not ignore the growing threat of violence from far-right extremists in Britain in the wake of ISIS terrorism and crimes involving UK Muslims, a senior Home Office adviser said today.

The anonymous expert on right-wing extremism warned that the Government is putting an emphasis on the ‘global jihadist agenda’ while possibly ignoring the growth of the far-right at home.

The adviser warned of the importance of preventing a violent attack being carried out by the far-right in Britain in the future.

Danger: Fighters from ISIS march in Raqqa, Syria, earlier this year. A Home Office adviser has warned ministers must not ignore the growing threat of violence from far-right extremists in Britain in the wake of ISIS terrorism

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘I have been working with people from the far-right for about 27 years now.

‘I can see increases in some of these groups and membership in some of these groups based on things that are happening nationally here and internationally.

‘A lot of the emphasis is put on the global jihadist agenda, which is fine, and it needs to be, but I really feel that this agenda, the repercussions of some of that in terms of the far-right can’t be ignored.

‘I wouldn’t want to get to the point where something happens and we look back and think actually we should have addressed that as well.’

The expert said he had met someone who wanted to put everyone who was not white British into Nazi-style death camps.

He told the programme: ‘I had one 
person who said he would like to implement death camps here in the UK 
and when I asked who he would like to put in the death camps, he just 
listed everyone that he didn’t see as white British. So that was every 
Asian person, every black person.’

Senior Home Office adviser

Labour former communities secretary 
Hazel Blears said the Government needs to better support the Muslim 
majority who condemn Islamist extremism.

She called on ministers to beef up the anti-extremism Prevent programme and bring different communities together.

Efforts
 should be made to work with more young Muslims and encourage people 
from the community to become school governors and magistrates, she 
added.

Miss Blears said: ‘I honestly do not 
think that the Government is doing enough in the whole Prevent programme
 to bring people together and to support the Muslim majority who are 
absolutely horrified at what’s been happening.’

A Home Office spokesman told MailOnline: ‘The Prevent strategy tackles all forms of extremism, including from the far-right. As the shocking murder of Mohammed Saleem last year demonstrated, we should not underestimate the threat it poses.

‘By fundamentally revising Prevent in 2011, and through the work of the Extremism Task Force, we have improved the way we tackle extremism and radicalisation. Since 2011, we have implemented a raft of practical measures to strengthen our approach in prisons, schools, universities and online.’

And an Association of Chief Police Officers 
spokesman told MailOnline: ‘We are not seeing an increase in right-wing extremist attacks or activity. 

'The police take the threat from all forms of extremism extremely seriously and the specific threat from right-wing extremism is constantly monitored'

‘There’s not been a notable increase in anti-Islamic hate crime - however, some Muslims communities in the UK feel more vulnerable due to the extensive coverage of terrorist activity and the extreme views of Islam promoted by ISIS and other terrorist groups.

‘The police take the threat from all forms of extremism extremely seriously and the specific threat from right-wing extremism is constantly monitored.  

‘Police work to prevent people being drawn into extremism through a variety of methods including every day neighbourhood policing and specific community engagement programmes. The Channel programme also provides tailored support to those who are at most risk of radicalisation.’
