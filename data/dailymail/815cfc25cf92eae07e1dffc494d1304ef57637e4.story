Can you pass me the melly before you make the chupley?

If this sounds like gibberish to you, you’re now in the minority, according to experts.

Linguists have published a list of new list of ‘domestic’ slang words which they say are now commonplace in British homes.

Unlike some other slang, these words are used by people of all generations and are often used as a way to bond with other family members.

According to researchers, people are now more than likely to ask for 'splosh', 'chupley' or 'blish' when they fancy a cup of tea

According to the research, people are now more than likely to ask for ‘splosh’, ‘chupley’ or ‘blish’ when they fancy a cup of tea.

And among the 57 new words identified meaning television remote control are ‘blabber’, ‘zapper’, ‘melly’ and ‘dawicki’.

The new words were published this week in the Dictionary of Contemporary Slang, which examines the changing language of today’s society.

Author Tony Thorne, an academic at King’s College London, said domestic slang was now being used in the many British households.

He added: ‘Once associated with enclosed communities such as the prison, the army barracks, the factory floor and the older public schools, more recently slang has escaped its boundaries and is running wild.’

Other household slang used by families include ‘grooglums’, the bits of food left in the sink after washing up, and ‘slabby-gangaroot’, the dried ketchup left around the mouth of the bottle.

Researchers at Winchester University referred to the new household language as 'kitchen-table lingo', and say it is used to bond with family members

The personal possessions of a grandparent are now referred to as ‘trunklements’, while underpants are known as ‘gruds’.

And in less well-mannered households, there is a new word for the act of scratching one’s backside - ‘frarping’.

Researchers at Winchester University referred to the new household language as ‘kitchen-table lingo’.

They said that while slang is often used 
by young people as a way of excluding adults, these words were used as a
 way of collaborating between the generations.

Bill Lucas, professor of learning and a trustee of the English Project at Winchester University, which catalogued the family slang words, told the Sunday Times: ‘A lot of these words are inspired by the sound or the look of a thing, or are driven by an emotional response to that being described.’

The dictionary also contained sections on new youth slang, which experts say is changing more rapidly because of immigration.

Many of the words used by today’s teenagers can be traced to the street jargon of the Caribbean, according to the research.

Examples include ‘choong’ and ‘peng’, meaning attractive, and ‘blud’ for friend.

The word ‘merk’ has evolved to mean ‘to humiliate’ among west London teenagers, but originates from American street gangs where it is used as a verb to describe murder.

Other words and phrases used by teenagers, such as ‘totes’ - or totally - and ‘amazeballs’ - meaning amazing - also feature in the new dictionary.

There is also ‘nim-nimnim’, describing boring adult conversation, and ‘meh’, a verbal shrug of indifference.

Internet-savvy mothers have also emerged as slang artists with words such as ‘boyf’ for boyfriend, ‘hubz’ for husband and ‘soz’ for sorry now in common use.

Texters are using abbreviations such as ‘YOLO’ (you only live once), ‘LMAO’ (laughing my ass off) and ‘CBA’ (can’t be arsed).

Teenagers are also adopting old-fashioned words picked up from grandparents as ‘gran slang’.

Thorne said he found teenagers using old-fashioned words such as ‘reek’, ‘trek’, ‘luka’ (from lucre), ‘galavanting’ and ‘rapscallion’ as new slang.

But some critics say slang lowers educational standards and damages the career prospects of youngsters.

Professor Mark Pagel, an evolutionary biologist at Reading University, said: ‘There is nothing inherently inferior about slang but it doesn’t cross boundaries very well.

‘So if you want to get on then you have to behave like the majority group or those in power who are setting and marking the exams or providing the employment.’
