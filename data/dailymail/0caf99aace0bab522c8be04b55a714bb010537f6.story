These are the adorable images a photographer took of her young nephews and a dachshund named Chewbacca reenacting scenes from Star Wars.

The shoot was arranged by pet photographer Rocio Preciado to celebrate Chewbacca's 12th birthday, and took place in a park close to her home in Hermosillo, Northern Mexico.

Ms Preciado recruited her seven and four-year-old nephews to play Darth Vader and Han Solo in the shoot, and even got her elderly mother to help her create the authentic-looking costumes.

Family affair: Ms Preciado recruited her seven and four-year-old nephews to play Darth Vader and Chewbacca respectively. She even got her elderly mother to help her create the authentic-looking costumes

Celebration: Rocio Preciado said she had planned to do a Star Wars-themed shoot with Chewbacca for a number of years, but only got round to it when her pet turned 12

Speaking about the shoot, Ms Preciado said: 'I've had this idea for a while, I'm a big Star Wars fan and that's actually my dachshund, named Chewbacca.'

'Things just started to get together and I finally got the chance to do the photoshoot to celebrate Chewbacca's 12th birthday,' she added.

She recruited her seven-year old nephew Roberto Preciado, 4, to play Darth Vader in the shoot, and his younger brother Matías, 4, to play Han Solo.

Ms Preciado says she chose the park in Hermosillo for the shoot because she thinks it resembles the forest moon of Endor in the second Star Wars film 'Return of the Jedi'.

The woodland scenes in the film were actually shot in two northern California locations: a redwood forest at Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park near Crescent City, and in the Redwood grove near the Skywalker Ranch in Marin County.

In Star Wars, the Chewbacca charator is described as a 'gentle, hairy, non-English-speaking co-pilot' and was inspired by George Lucas seeing his own dog sitting up on the passenger seat of his car.

The dog, named Indiana, also inspired the name of the lead character in another one of Lucas' film franchises - Indiana Jones.

Recruit: Rocio Preciado said that when the opportunity to do a Star Wars-themed shoot with Chewbacca arrived, she couldn't resist getting her two young nephews involved

One theory is that Chewbacca's name is derived from собака - pronounced sobaka - the Russian word for dog.

To give the shoot an authentic Star Wars look, Ms Preciado used a special filter on her camera that makes the photographs look vintage.

Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, which was released in 1983, was the third film in the Star Wars franchise, and made over £280million worldwide.

The original teaser trailer for the film carried the name 'Revenge of the Jedi' but shortly before release writer George Lucas decided that 'revenge' was not appropriate to the storyline and renamed it Return of the Jedi.

It was 16 years until another Star Wars film was made - the critically panned The Phantom Menace.
