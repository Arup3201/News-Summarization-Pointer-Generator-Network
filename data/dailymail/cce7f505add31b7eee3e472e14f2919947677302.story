She said I could: John Grant Tasered his wife several times after she lost a bet about the winner of Monday night's nail biter Bears vs. Packers game

This is the bizarre moment an Illinois man Tasered his wife three times after winning a bet on a football game.

At last Monday's Bears-Packers game in a Wisconsin bar, John Grant, 42, a Bears fan, and his wife Nicole, a Packers supporter, decided to make things interesting.

They agreed that whoever's team won would be allowed shock the other with a Taser, and when the Bears won 27-20 and the couple walked outside to an alleyway where Nicole leaned up against the wall ready for her forfeit.

While she starts the video laughing, after the first shock she collapses to the floor, shielding herself behind a friend's legs, obviously in pain.

Oblivious to her suffering, Grant reaches through the other man's legs and administers a second shock, before walking around to her side and hitting her again, this time on her thigh.

Deciding she had had enough, Nicole called the police just after midnight on Tuesday who arrested John for possessing a Taser, which is illegal without a licence in Wisconsin.

Nicole also told dispatchers her husband had thrown their dog out of the semi-truck they were sharing as their home and then locked her out too.

Christopher MacNeill, chief of Mayville Police Department, said: 'You just couldn't make it up.'

Speaking to CNN, he added: 'The Taser that he had was a skin contact taser which, if you use it enough times or in the same place, can actually leave burn marks.'

Both of them consented to breathalyzers and were determined to be well over the limit of intoxication.

The the subsequent police interview Grant told said that they'd gotten
 into a fight because she'd been smoking marijuana in the bathroom 
at the sports bar.

His wife, Grant told the police, smoked too much of the stuff and it hinders her from keeping a job.

Speaking to CNN, Chris Neu, a bartender at the Small Town Wisconsin Tavern, said: 'They had a bet between the two of them. The loser was supposed to get Tasered by the winner.

'She kind of laughed it off, they videotaped it and everything else. I had no inkling at all that the would end up in a altercation at the end of the night.'

Despite the allegations, Nicole has now dropped all charges against her husband.
