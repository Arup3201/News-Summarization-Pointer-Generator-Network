Appeal: Former Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins, who was handed a 35-year sentence for a string of child sex offences, has lodged an application for permission to appeal

Former Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins, who was handed a 35-year sentence for a string of child sex offences, has lodged an application for permission to appeal his prison term.

The Court of Appeal move by the disgraced rock star, whose sentence is made up of a custodial term of 29 years and a further six years on licence, was confirmed by the Judicial Office today.

Watkins, 36, from Pontypridd, was sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court last month.

He confessed to 13 sickening offences, including two counts of attempted rape of a baby, and was described as aÂ  'determined and committed paedophile' by the presiding judge.

His two accomplices, who can only be named as Woman A and Woman B for legal reasons, were jailed for 14 years and 16 years respectively.

The court was told that after sexually touching a groupie's 11-month-old baby, Watkins tried to have penetrative sex with the child.

He also encouraged a second fan to abuse her child during a webcam chat and secretly stashed child porn videos, some of which he had made himself.

Sentencing judge Mr Justice Royce told Watkins: 'Those who have appeared in these courts over many years see a large number of horrific cases. This case, however, breaks new ground.

'I am satisfied that you are a deeply corrupting influence, you are highly manipulative, you are a sexual predator, you are dangerous.

'The public and, in particular, young females need protection from you.'

Watkins was told that he will have to serve two-thirds of the custodial term before he can be considered for release by the Parole Board.

Lostprophets were founded in Pontypridd in 1997 and the band sold about 3.5 million albums worldwide.

His
 former bandmates have turned their back on him - saying they are 
'heartbroken, angry, and disgusted' at his sex crimes and have urged 
more of his victims to contact police.
