Mango's new Violeta line ranges from sizes 12-24

Spanish clothing giant Mango has come under fire from shoppers in the wake of launching a plus-size clothing line for women from sizes 12 to 24.

Consumers in Spain and the UK have taken to Twitter irked at the implication that anything over a size 10 is considered 'large'.

The Violeta line - which is accompanied by the tag 'it suits me and I like it' - is a 400-piece collection available online now and in stores from tomorrow.

A spokesman for Mango said: 'The
 secret to this new project lies in the care taken in the technical 
pattern details from size to size and in being able to offer a high 
quality collection for any moment of the day, aimed at a modern and 
demanding woman who wants to feel attractive, sexy and fashionable.

'Consequently,
 the aim of Violeta by Mango is to dress a young target market in sizes 
12 to 24 with garments designed to be comfortable, feminine and modern.'

But while the Government and fashion editors have celebrated the collection, Mango has been accused by shoppers on Twitter of stigmatising women larger than a size 10, and even encouraging eating disorders.

A campaign group in Spain have called for the line's withdrawal.

Jenny Willott, Minister for Women and Equalities, told The Times: 'Diversity makes good business sense - research shows that plus-size women are frustrated by the poor choice of fashion available to them and embarrassed by retail environments that separate them from other women.

'I welcome moves by the retail industry to reflect and celebrate the great diversity we have in the UK. I would like to see more retailers doing the same.'

While Trish Halpin, Marie Claire's editor-in-chief said 'there's the demand to address the style needs for women of all shapes and sizes. It's great that Mango are engaging with a larger-sized audience'.

But Spanish shoppers say the line is alienating to larger women and stigmatising to those who are smaller, and should be withdrawn.

One lawyer, Arantxa Calvera, launched an online petition that already has 57,000 signatures.

She said: 'To consider a size 12 as a plus size is to have a distorted picture of the reality.'

On Twitter, plus-size shoppers commented that the line was too 'beige', and that they were 'underwhelmed'.

A spokesman for Mango said: 'In view of the controversy surrounding the launch of Violeta by MANGO, the company would like to reiterate that Violeta by MANGO is a new brand within the group which was created to cover an existing demand in the market by offering a fashion collection in sizes that extend up to 24.

'What differentiates said brand is the attention to technical details, pattern to pattern and size to size, and the selection of garment materials and fabrics, which have been produced to be more comfortable, feminine and modern.

'The key characteristic of this line is the personalisation of the collection to a new target market, the result of painstaking work and effort on the silhouette and pattern of each size.'
