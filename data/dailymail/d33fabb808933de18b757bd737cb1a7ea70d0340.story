Professor Don A. Samuelson arrested for secretly videotaping students (mugshot pictured)

A University professor has been arrested for allegedly filming up female students' skirts using a camera pen in his class.

Don Samuelson, 65, also used the pen to allegedly film the cleavage of two girls at the University of Florida.

When arrested on Friday, he claimed he had made the films to prove the girls were not wearing any underwear because he thought it was inappropriate.

But an examination of the hard drive on the pen revealed other pornographic images.

Samuleson is a tenured professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Florida in Gainesville.

According to police he used the camera pen on two occasions to secretly view and record under a student's shirt.

Samuelson is alleged to have pointed the pen towards the gap between the female student's chest and the v-neck of her shirt.

In June, Samuelson allegedly targeted another student, aiming the camera pen down her cleavage.

Then in August, he allegedly targeted the same victim when he pointed the pen up her skirt.

The victim noticed he was videotaping, according to the police report and told campus police.

The camera pen containing multiple pornographic images was allegedly found in Samuelson's office on September 9th by university police.

He admitted to owning the recording device.

The pen had an integrated USB thumb drive where the videos were stored, according to police.

Also on various thumb drives recovered by police were videos of several other females working in Samuelson's lab or meeting with him in his office.

College chiefs placed the professor on administrative leave after the 'up skirt filming' allegations were made.

'He was placed on administrative leave as soon as the university learned of the allegations against him and he is prohibited from campus,' said Janine Sikes Assistant Vice President of Media Relations at UF.

Sikes said the professor is facing being sacked.

'In situations of a serious nature such as the allegations in this case, the appropriate course of action is termination,' said Sikes.

Samuelson was bonded out of Alachaua County Jail Saturday night.Â 

He faces two counts of video voyeurism of a 19-year-old or older, a third degree felony.
