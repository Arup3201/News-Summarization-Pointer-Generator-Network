BBC bosses will not be investigated by police over claims the law was broken when huge pay-offs were given to senior managers.

The Metropolitan Police said there was 'insufficient evidence of dishonesty or criminal misconduct to begin a criminal investigation'.

It comes after the Corporation called in external auditors to widen the search for excessive severance payoffs made to its senior executives.

Questions: The BBC is under pressure over the scale of severance payments to senior managers

Director general 
Tony Hall ordered KPMG to look at
deals made to departing staff prior to 2010 to get to the bottom of the
severance pay scandal.

The
National Audit Office is also investigating the files of 90 senior managers 
handed golden goodbyes in the past three years to see if they breached 
contractual limits.

But the controversial pay-outs will not be the subject of a criminal investigation, Scotland Yard said.

Conservative MP Rob Wilson last month 
called on the Met Police to investigate allegations of fraud and 
misconduct in public office.

The
Reading East MP asked officers to examine the merits of a wider 
investigation ‘as to the possibility of fraud, collusion in fraud, 
misuse of public funds, or other wrongdoing in relation to severance 
payments at the BBC in recent years’.

In response Scotland Yard said it was 'gathering information' on cases to see if the law had been broken.

But today a spokesman said: 'The Metropolitan Police Service received allegations of misconduct in a public office and fraud in relation to severance payments and wider benefits for senior BBC managers.

'These allegations have been carefully assessed by officers from the Fraud Squad, Specialist, Organised and Economic Crime Command.

'The assessment, of available material, has concluded there is insufficient evidence of dishonesty or criminal misconduct to begin a criminal investigation, and the MPS will not be taking any further action.'

Police: Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley told Tory MP Rob Wilson that fraud squad officers were gathering evidence covering BBC pay-offs, but now Scotland Yard says it has found insufficient evidence to launch a criminal probe

The NAO's first report identified one case 
where a BBC executive was paid £300,000 in lieu of notice after their 
redundancy was agreed - despite serving their notice in full.

The
payment, equivalent to the cost of 2,062 licence fees - was agreed by 
then director-general Mark Thompson, and the unnamed figure’s redundancy
was paid even though they had found a new job.

The
report also highlighted the case of former BBC2 controller Roly 
Keating, who was given a £375,000 pay-off but returned the money last 
month after learning it had not been properly authorised.

Its devastating report found the BBC 
handed its staff £369million over eight years, but only looked in detail
at the most recent cases.

The
KPMG review means even more high-profile deals could come under 
scrutiny, including a £500,000 payoff to former BBC1 controller Peter 
Fincham in 2007.

He resigned
in disgrace after he was criticised for making false claims about 
doctored footage of the Queen. Lord Hall has already asked for a 
‘detailed briefing’ into his payoff, although the BBC has not yet 
confirmed whether it will publish what he is told.

Another
historic payoff likely to come under the spotlight is a six-figure sum 
handed to Lesley Douglas, a former controller of Radio 2 who resigned 
over the ‘Sachsgate’ scandal involving Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross.

Many BBC staff on lower salaries are understood to be furious at the high severance payments.

In his email to staff earlier this month, Lord 
Hall tried to boost morale, saying: ‘I know this issue has provoked a 
very strong reaction from many of you and I understand why you feel that
way.

'It is worth saying however that severance pay in general was part 
of an attempt to reduce senior management numbers, and in the process we
did save £35m which went back into programme-making and will continue 
to do so at a rate of £19m a year as we move forwards.

‘However, it is clear this was not 
done in accordance with best practice – that is why we have already 
tightened up procedures and also why we will not contemplate this level 
of payoff in the future, even though senior posts will continue to 
decline in number.’

A BBC spokesman would not comment on which specific deals KPMG is likely to look at. Findings will be published on September 9.

But this week it emerged KPMG has spent thousands of pounds wining and dining some of the executives responsible for the most controversial payoffs.

Lord Hall's decision to call in the firm was questioned after the company lavished some of the key figures in the scandal with hospitality including concert tickets, champagne and meals at top restaurants.
