Appeal: Emma Lignum is desperate to be reunited with her four-year-old son Yiannis

A mother desperate to be reunited with her son has launched a court battle to force his Greek father to let her see him.

Emma Lignum has not seen four-year-old Yiannis since May, when his father Achilles Mouzakitis took him to Corfu.

Her ex has since apparently cut off contact with her and failed to turn up to court hearings intended to settle the debate over custody of Yiannis.

Ms Lignum, from Middleton in Greater Manchester, has turned to the courts in an attempt to secure access to her son.

The 26-year-old is also offering a reward for anyone who can give her information about Yiannis' possible whereabouts.

Mr Mouzakitis has not attended any court hearings, and apparently gave officials an outdated address, meaning the authorities are none the wiser about the current location of him and his son.

'He sent his lawyer to advise the judge that he had the child,' Ms Lignum said. 'But he's given our old address to the courts, where we lived as a family.

'Custody remains with me and he should return our child. There's still a warrant for his arrest.

'I've been back at home for Christmas with my family, but I will be returning to Greece until we find Yiannis. Someone somewhere must know where he is living.'

The Mancunian met Mr Mouzakitis, 43, when she was working as a holiday representative for a travel company, and she moved to Athens to live with him in 2008.

The couple's son was born in September 2008, but around a year ago they split up and Ms Lignum made plans to move back to the UK with Yiannis.

Mr Mouzakitis spent two weeks looking after the boy while Ms Lignum moved out of their home, but when he was due to return him he told her that Yiannis was ill and should stay with him for an extra day.

She went to their house to collect the four-year-old the next day, but found no sign of either of them.

Ms Lignum managed to talk to Mr Mouzakitis, who told her he had taken their son to Corfu - but he soon change his phone number, leaving her unable to contact him.

'Taken': The Mancunian mother says her ex Achilles Mouzakitis has cut off all contact with her

The distraught mother travelled to the island to look for Yiannis, but residents of the village where her ex's family lived said they had not seen either the father or the son.

She has since appealed to tourists for information on her son.

Ms Lignum has asked holidaymakers who think they may have seen Yiannis or Mr Mouzakitis to contact her via her Facebook page.
