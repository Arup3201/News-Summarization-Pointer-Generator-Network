The 76-year-old British pensioner and convicted paedophile arrested with possible links to the Madeleine McCann case molested two Australian girls aged just eight or nine years old, but remained free for two decades because he was repeatedly granted bail.

Roderick William Robinson, 76, was extradited from Portugal in 2010 to face the Sydney child molestation charges, just three years after Madelaine, aged three, was abducted from Portugal's Algarve region.

Robinson, also known as Roderick McDonald, is being held in Malta pending extradition to the UK on sex offences.

Child molester: Roderick William Robinson (pictured after his arrest in Thailand in 2011) molested two Australian girls aged under ten in the late 1980s, but did not face justice until he was extradited from Portugal in 2010 to Sydney, where he was sentenced to a maximum of six months and released seven days later because of time served

On the run: Serial paedophile Roderick William Robinson molested two Australian girls aged under ten years old in the late 1980s, and has reportedly been on the run for almost 20 years before Madeleine McCann (pictured) was abducted in Portugal in 2007

Fake: Robinson who also is known as McDonald used this fake passport to flee Australia before he was deported following his conviction of child sex charges. After  25 years abroad, Robinson will finally be extradited back to the UK where he faces questioning over links to the McCann case

Scotland Yard wants to interview Robinson about paedophile gangs which operated in the Algarve region in 2007 - when three-year-old Madeleine vanished. 

Robinson, who is suspected of molesting little girls in several countries including Thailand and New Zealand going back more than two decades, was extradited from Portugal to Sydney in 2010 after allegedly assaulting a nine-year-old girl.

On March 30, 2010, police arrested Robinson in Portgual. He arrived under guard in Sydney on June 6, 2010, when he appeared in Parramatta Bail Court charged with two counts of indecent assault with a person under the age of 10.

Key witness: While Kate and Gerry McCann (above, right) suffered for seven years following the disappearance of their daughter Madeleine (left), a convicted paedophile who molested young girls in Australia and was living in Portugal had skipped bail and evaded authorities

Robinson allegedly committed the offences in Sydney between October 14, 1998 and August 21, 1999.

He was remanded in custody. On September 22 that year in Liverpool Local Court, he pleaded guilty to the two underage indecent assault charges. A further charge of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of ten years was withdrawn and dismissed.

The magistrate sentenced Robinson to two concurrent prison terms, but because they commenced on the date of his arrest in Portugal, by the time of his sentence, one had already expired and he had only seven days remaining on a six month term.

Brazen: Roderick William Robinson, now 76, was thrown out of Thailand in 2011 after a special police operation uncovered his infamous past, but the child molester served only a brief sentence in Australia for abusing primary schoolgirls and a charge of his having had sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of ten was withdrawn

On October 19, 2010, Robinson was listed in Central Local Court in Sydney for extradition, but the matter appears to have been dismissed, perhaps because he had already left the country.

Four months later, Robinson was arrested in Thailand where it was said he fled to on a forged passport from Australia.

Thai police arrested Robinson at a terrace house in Pattaya, a known paedophile haunt 120km east of the capital, Bangkok, as part of an ongoing operation by Thailand's Serious Organised Crime Agency.

The Thai government deported Robinson back to the UK to face for further charges.

Police Colonel Shusak Phanatamphorn said when Robinson was originally charged in Australia over the offences in the late 1980s, he was  released on bail and fled to New Zealand, where he was also accused of abusing young girls.
