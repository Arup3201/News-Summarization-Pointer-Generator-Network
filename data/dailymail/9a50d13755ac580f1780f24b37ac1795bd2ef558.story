Kevin Pietersen waded into the controversy surrounding the state of English pitches by accusing an MCC groundsman of intentionally dragging his foot along the middle during a break in play on Saturday.

On the day it emerged Nottinghamshire could face a £9,000 fine after the pitch for the first Test at Trent Bridge was deemed ‘poor’, the former England player posted a short video on Instagram. It appeared to show groundsman Shane Doherty sliding his foot on a good length before being stopped by another groundstaff member.

‘UNBELIEVABLE!’ Pietersen tweeted, before adding: ‘I cannot believe what I’ve just seen from one of the groundstaff!’

Suspect: Michael Vaughan questions the motives behind the incident

The MCC insisted Doherty had made ‘a genuine, honest mistake and there was no intent to damage the pitch’ while head groundsman Mick Hunt added ‘maybe he has had too much sun’.

David Boon, match referee for the first Test, rated the pitch ‘poor’. Notts face a fine if the ICC agree.

England players were known to be frustrated with the pitch used for the drawn Test, which one described as being ‘more like a sub-continental pitch than a sub-continental pitch.’
