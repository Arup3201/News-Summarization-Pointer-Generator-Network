Police have identified the man who was viciously pushed to his death onto the subway tracks in New York City as a hardworking immigrant from India who had only recently launched his own business.

Sunando Sen, 46, a native of Calcutta, was shoved into the path of an approaching 7 train in Queens by a muttering woman who then fled the 40th street station.

New York city Police commissioner Raymond Kelly said that Sen was looking westbound as the train was pulling into the station and likely didn't see the woman leaping from a bench and shoving him at the last moment.

The New York Daily News reported that Sen had been in the U.S. for the past 20 years and lived in Queens in an apartment with at least two roommates.

'I think she's crazy,' Sen's shocked roommate Ar Suman, told the New York Post. 'I can't believe this right now.'

Suman said that the 46-year-old, who 
was single and childless, had just opened a copy shop, the New Amsterdam
Printing Co, with another man on Manhattan’s Upper West Side.

'My heart is broken because this guy was so nice and quiet,' added Sen’s other roommate, Md Khan.

On Friday, Sen's business partner was trying to reach the victim's relatives in 
India to deliver them the bad news. 

Meanwhile, police sounded optimistic 
about the prospect of identifying Sen's attacker in the near future, 
saying that they are following some hotline tips.

‘We’re reasonably confident that we’ll identify the suspect. We are properly deployed in transit areas,' Kelly said.

According to the commissioner, 
officers were able to identify Sen using his wallet and laptop that were
recovered at the scene.

On the run: The suspect, described as a Hispanic woman in her 20s, was captured on a surveillance camera fleeing from the train station after the incident

Clue: Police obtained grainy surveillance footage from a nearby pizzeria showing a woman said to be wearing a blue, white and gray ski jacket and Nike sneakers running away

The unidentified woman, seen fleeing on video, was reportedly muttering to herself

It has been reported that the man's body was severely disfigured after he became wedged under the second car of the train.

Sen's death marks a second time this month that someone has been killed in a such gruesome fashion.

He was standing on the elevated 
platform of a 7 train in Queens at about 8pm when the woman, who 
witnesses said had been following him closely and muttering to herself, 
shoved him onto the tracks.

The victim hadn't appeared to notice her before falling to his death in front of the barreling train.

New York Police Department chief 
spokesman Paul Browne said the woman fled the scene after the shocking attack and officers were searching for her.

She
was described as Hispanic, in her 20s, heavyset and about 5-foot-5, 
wearing a blue, white and gray ski jacket and Nike sneakers with gray on
top and red on the bottom.

The man was hit by the first car of an 11-car northbound train and got stuck under the wheels of the second car, Browne said.

According to witnesses, at around 8pm a woman was seen pacing and muttering to herself. She then sat down on a wooden bench at the end of the platform, where she waited until the last possible moment before pushing a man in front of the approaching train.

The NYPD chief added that the victim, who was 
pronounced dead at the scene, had 'terrible injuries that make providing
a description difficult at this time.'

Police said it
was unclear if the man and the woman knew each other before the tragic incident.

'We haven’t determined whether it was random or if there was some connection yet,' Browne said. 'But there was nothing from what the witnesses could see to indicate that they knew each other and he did not, according to the witnesses, appear to realize that she was approaching.'

It also has not been determined if anyone tried
to help the man up before he was struck by the train. However, according to witnesses, there wouldn't have been time.

By 10:30, the victim's mangled body was still on the tracks, according to The Sunnyside Post.

Officers from the Emergency Services 
Unit planned to lift the train carriage using specialised inflatable 
bags to recover his remains.

'I
heard the train screech as it was stopping and then heard this loud 
scream,' Linda Santini-Tripodis, who was beneath the 40th Street station
at the time, told the newspaper. 'I'm never going to forget that scream for as long as I live.'

Browne said there was 'no trend' of 
such horrific occurrences despite the incident being the second of its 
type in the space of a month.

'It's the urban nightmare,' Browne told Bloomberg.

'It's sometimes in the back of peoples' minds because of the incident preceding this one, but there's no indication that it is related in any way or inspired it,' he said.

During his weekly radio address Friday morning, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said that while such attacks were extremely rare, he understood how statistics did not diminish the tragedy for the families of the victims the New York Times reported.

'To say it’s only two in a long period of time doesn’t help either person,' he said. 'I don’t know what happened here.'

Shocking: The man, who hasn't been identified, was standing on the elevated platform of a 7 train in Queens at about 8pm when he was shoved on the tracks

Police viewed footage from a 24-hour surveillance camera outside a pizza restaurant located across from the station and were able to obtain clear images of the suspect, according to The New York Times.

'She jumps from the stairs and she just runs,' Oasis Restaurant owner, Giovanni Briones, told the newspaper, describing the video he provided detectives.

He said he did not recognise the woman but that a restaurant regular was on the train and said they felt a bump as it ran over the man. 

On December 3, 58-year-old Ki-Suck Han was shoved in front of a train in Times Square.

A photograph of him on the tracks a 
split second before he was killed was published on the front of the New 
York Post the next day, causing an uproar and debate over whether the 
photographer, who had been waiting for a train, should have tried to 
help him and whether the newspaper should have run the image.

Apparently
no one else tried to help up Han, either.

Dead: Ki-Suck Han, pictured, was shoved in front of a train in Times Square

A homeless man, 30-year-old Naeem Davis, was charged with murder in Han's death and is being held without bail.

He has pleaded not guilty, claiming Han was the aggressor and had attacked him first. The two men hadn't met before.

Service was suspended tonight on the 7 train line, which connects Manhattan and Queens, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has been using buses to shuttle riders while police investigate.

Being pushed onto the train tracks is a silent fear for many of the commuters who ride the city's subway a total of more than 5.2 million times on an average weekday, but deaths are rare.

Among the more high-profile cases was the January 1999 death of aspiring screenwriter Kendra Webdale, who was shoved by a former mental patient.

After that, the state Legislature passed Kendra's Law, which lets mental health authorities supervise patients who live outside institutions to make sure they are taking their medications and aren't threats to safety.

On Friday, Mayor Bloomberg said that had some concerns about the state releasing mentally ill people from custody.
