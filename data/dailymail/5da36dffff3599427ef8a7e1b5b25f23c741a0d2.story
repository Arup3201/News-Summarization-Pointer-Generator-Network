The Queen failed to mention her German ancestors in her 1972 Christmas Day TV broadcast for fear of provoking a ‘snide’ public backlash, according to previously unseen official papers.

They show she had planned to refer to her ‘continental relations’ but had a change of heart after talks at the highest levels of government.

The seeming embarrassment about her close family ties echoed that of the First World War, when fierce anti-German feeling led to the Royal Family changing its name from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor.

In 1972, the then Prime Minister Edward Heath – who had been shown the speech in advance – told the Queen she could refer to Britain’s forthcoming membership of the Common Market in her Christmas broadcast only if her comments were personal and stressed her own ties with Europe.

But on December 1, 1972, Sir Robert Armstrong, Heath’s Principal Private Secretary, told him: ‘You suggested [the Queen] might make her references to Europe personal: referring to the historical links we have with Europe... or her own personal ties of kinship with families in many parts of Europe. In the end her advisers have felt this would make the broadcast longer than she wishes; they also fear references to her continental relations will give rise to snide remarks.’

The Royal Family gained the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha name when the Queen’s great-great grandmother, Queen Victoria, married Prince Albert in 1840. The couple’s son, King Edward VII, and their grandson, King George V, both ruled as monarchs using the German surname.

These close links were considered acceptable until the First World War, when British public opinion struggled to cope with the fact that Germany’s Kaiser Wilhelm II was a grandson of Queen Victoria and a cousin of George V. In 1917, George V – the Queen’s grandfather – was forced to change the family’s name to the more British-sounding Windsor after a huge rise in anti-German feeling.

The previously unseen papers in the National Archives, which cover the Queen’s Christmas speeches from 1952 to 1973, show she often reads from texts prepared by those who are not part of the Royal Household. They reveal Prime Ministers are shown the speech in advance, can make alterations, and have even stopped the Queen including topical references to contentious issues. In 1973, Heath advised the Queen that a reference to the country’s industrial woes and the three-day week would risk her political neutrality. The papers show negotiations went right up to the wire.

On December 5, 1973, Sir Robert told the Prime Minister: ‘It [the Christmas broadcast] has been recorded today, but could be redone if there was anything to which you took strong objection.’

However, the Queen has on occasion rebelled against these attempts at censorship, and in 1969 refused to record a Christmas message. It was seen as a protest at Harold Wilson’s decision to stop her mentioning the country’s economic woes in her 1968 speech.

Civil servants were particularly nervous about that broadcast because the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh broke with tradition and decided to write it themselves.

A Palace spokesman said: ‘The Queen’s Christmas broadcast is very such Her Majesty’s personal message to the UK and the Commonwealth. A draft is shown to the Prime Minister as a courtesy and because the Queen acts on the advice of her Government. As with other exchanges between the Queen and the PM, we would not comment on the detail or historical events.’
