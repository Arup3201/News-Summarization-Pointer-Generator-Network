Controversial mining magnate Nathan Tinkler has handed in his keys at the Newcastle Knights after it emerged negative text messages were sent to players from his phone.

After months of negotiations with a fed-up member base, Tinkler released a statement to The Daily Telegraph in which he confirmed he would give up ownership of the struggling club.

'This negotiation has dragged on for over 10 weeks and it is clear the Members Club has stalled the process,' the statement read.

'After injecting over $20 million of my own money it is time to stand aside, and hopefully the Knights will prosper and not revert to the old management style and formula that almost sent the club into liquidation 3 years ago.

'We are determined to do everything to make it a smooth transition, but we require all accounts to be settled before leaving the Club — then it will be up to others to take the Club forward.

'Once all liabilities are paid there will be adequate cash flow available to support the new owners...The Club is in a far better position than it was when HSG took over, with the Club then drowning in $7 million of debt, inadequate administration facilities and no formal training facility.'

Mr Tinkler said he had raised expenditure at the Knights during his time at the club and the transition would mean there would need to be spending cut.

The move came on the same day it was revealed a number of high-profile players at the club received text messages from Tinkler’s phone in which they were called ‘soft’ and told ‘you’ll be gone by June 30’.

Queensland representative Darius Boyd has reportedly been on the receiving end of a number of negative messages from Tinkler’s phone, the struggling fullback told he could be out of the club before the June 30 deadline for player trades.

The Telegraph reported Boyd is ‘fuming’ about his treatment at the Knights and is owed $200,000 in overdue third-party payments.

The text messages reportedly started at Round 2 and continued until recently. 

Star five-eighth Jarrod Mullen and numerous other senior Knights players reportedly beared the brunt of the ‘out of line’ correspondence as they toiled through the opening 10 rounds of the NRL season with just two wins.

Approached about the messages from Tinkler’s phone, Hunter Sports Group chief executive Troy Palmer told The Daily Telegraph via text message: ‘I assume you have evidence of this as this is a serious allegation and will take whatever action available.

‘Nathan has always had an excellent relationship with players. They love him. You obviously haven’t heard about how he visited Alex (McKinnon) last week a day before his ICAC hearing and helped Alex with the first movement of his legs.’

Mr Palmer and Mr Tinkler were before ICAC earlier this month over alleged donations to a Liberal Party slush fund.
