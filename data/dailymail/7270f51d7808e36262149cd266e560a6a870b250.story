Brad Pitt spoke today about fianceé Angelina Jolie's recovery from her double mastectomy as he revealed she was focused on creating better access to genetic testing for those at higher risk of cancer. 

The actor, who has six children with Jolie, told GMA on Monday that it was 'business as usual' for his partner following her treatment. The Oscar-winning actress had discovered that she carries the defective BRCA-1 gene which gave her an 87 per cent chance of developing cancer.

Pitt said:'Her focus now is that all people have access to the testing. If you do your research it doesn't have to be scary, it can be an empowering thing.'

Jolie, 38, revealed her decision to 
have the double mastectomy in a New York Times article last month where 
she wrote that she had taken the difficult decision so she could tell 
her children 'they don’t need to fear they will lose me'.

Pitt spoke about his fiancée's 
decision to have the invasive treatment earlier this year as he carried out 
promotional duties for new movie World War Z in New York today.

He said: 'It's business as usual, she's doing great. When she wrote that piece, we had already come out the other end.

'It was a beautiful thing to watch and her focus now is that all people have access to the testing.

'If you do your research, it doesn't have to be scary, it is an empowering thing... I've been moved by every stage of this.'

Pitt is currently on a grueling summer promotional tour for zombie blockbuster World War Z with the next stop being in Russia.

He added that once the rounds of movie premieres are over then he would have a 'little more home time'.

Jolie's mother Marcheline Bertrand died of ovarian cancer at the age of 56 in 2007 and her maternal grandmother also had the disease.

She
said she carries a defective BRCA-1 gene that puts her at high risk of 
developing breast and ovarian cancers. Her doctor said that the test
that turned up the faulty gene link led Jolie to have both of her 
healthy breasts removed to try to avoid the same fate.

Writing in an editorial piece entitled 'My Medical Choice' in the New York Times, Angelina explained her decision, revealing that she had the initial procedure on February 16 before having the reconstruction operation on April 20.
