A woman who was the sole survivor of a serial killer who claimed the lives of at least eight victims is suing Lifetime and parent company A&E Television after the network portrayed her as a prostitute in a recent made for TV movie.

Daun Richert-Slagle, from Chico, California, was a 21-year-old mother of three back in 1990 when she was assaulted for several hours by Keith Hunter Jesperson, the man who would eventually become known as the Happy Face Killer.

According to Slagle, it was only because she had her young son with her at the time that he eventually agreed to let her go.

Now, in the new Lifetime film Happy Face Killer, Slagle is being portrayed not just as a prostitute, but as a woman who willingly had sex with the serial killer in front of her own child.

Slagle has responded by filing a lawsuit against Lifetime and A&E Television. 

'Some of these things could literally destroy my career,' the registered nurse said in an interview with KTLA. 

'In this particular case, Lifetime took somebody who had an innocent involvement with a serial killer and turned her, for whatever creative license or entertainment value, into a prostitute, into somebody trying to extort money, into being an unfit mother, which is completely deplorable,' added her attorney Tre Lovell.

Slagle claims that she and her husband had been arguing on April 13,1990, when she stormed out of the house and walked to a nearby shopping center with their youngest child.

It was there she struck up a conversation with Jesperson, eventually getting into his car as it was cold outside.

From there, he drove her to a nearby lake and sexually assaulted her for three hours in front of her son.

Jesperson, who at that point had killed at least one woman, would go on to claim the lives of at least seven more victims over a five-year span.

He earned his nickname for the smiley faces he would draw on letters he sent to taunt the media and local prosecutors. 

He was eventually arrested by authorities on March 30, 1995 and is currently serving three consecutive life sentences. 

Lifetime and A&E have yet to issue a statement on the lawsuit, and are still airing the film, which stars David Arquette as Jesperson.
