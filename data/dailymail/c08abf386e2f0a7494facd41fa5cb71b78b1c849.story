The body of a 36-year-old Army veteran and soon-to-be college graduate was found on Thursday at a remote Orange County canyon in California.

Maribel Ramos had been missing for two weeks. Her roommate, Kwang Chol ‘KC’ Joy, 54, has been arrested by authorities in connection with the murder.

He voluntarily submitted to an interview with detectives on Friday morning and was later arrested on suspicion of killing Ramos.

Right before Ramos disappeared she had asked him to move out, say her family, and neighbors had reported Joy acting suspiciously since her disappearance.

Ramos was honorably discharged from the army in 2008 after serving eight years, including tours in Iraq and South Korea.

She was set to graduate with a degree in criminal justice from Cal State Fullerton later this month, reports Fox.

Ramos was last seen on security camera video on May 2 at her Orange apartment complex, authorities said.

According to Maribel's family she had asked KC Joy to move out of her apartment just before she disappeared

The next day, she failed to show up 
at a veterans event at which she was scheduled to speak, then missed a 
softball game she had played weekly with one of her cousins for years.

Friends and relatives said it was out of character for her to walk away from her commitments without telling anyone.

‘She doesn't do anything like that,’ cousin Frank Campos said before the body was found. ‘She's not the type of person to get up and go. There had to be something.’

Family members said that when they went to her apartment after she first missed appointments, her car and her dog - a Chihuahua mix named Mia that was often at her side - were still there.

Family and friends organized walks through her neighborhood, handing out fliers and looking for clues. Her body was found in the brush near Modjeska Canyon.
