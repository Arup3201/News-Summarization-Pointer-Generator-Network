Cherie Blair hugged and kissed former IRA commander Martin McGuinness today after the pair joined 750 other mourners at the funeral of Tony Benn.

The human rights QC smiled and embraced Northern Ireland's deputy First Minister as they filed out of St Margaret's Church, Westminster this afternoon.

Public figures had been paying their last respects to Mr Benn, who served as a Labour MP for more than 50 years and died two weeks ago at 88.

Mr McGuinness attended the service with Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams, who Tony Blair admitted in his memoirs he liked 'more than I should have'.

Speaking about Tony Benn Mr Adams said:'He was a friend of Ireland and was good for the peace process'.

Mrs Blair and her husband got to know Mr McGuinness and Mr Adams 
during the peace process.

'Whether you like them or not, and no matter how strongly you disapprove of their past actions, they had courage in abundance,' Mr Blair wrote when he left power.

Cherie Blair's warmth towards the Northern Irish politician came two years after the Queen shook his hand.

The momentous act came 33 years after her cousin, Lord Mountbatten of Burma, was 
murdered by an IRA bomb as he holidayed with his family.

The decision to shake hands with a former IRA commander was an astonishing act of forgiveness by the 
86-year-old monarch who adored her ‘Uncle Dickie’.

Her husband, 
the Duke of Edinburgh, a nephew of Lord Mountbatten, also offered his 
hand even though Philip was exceptionally close to his uncle and took 
news of his murder in 1979 hard.

Message: Gerry Adams tweeted to his 45,000 followers that he was off to London for today's funeral

It also emerged that he may be travelling to Windsor Castle next month for a state dinner hosted by Her Majesty.

Mr McGuinness admitted his IRA past to the Saville Inquiry in 1998, 
but has always insisted he never killed anyone – claims that have been 
repeatedly questioned by his critics.

He joined the Provisional IRA as a teenager and quickly rose up the ranks. By 1971, aged 21, he was second in command of the IRA in Derry.

He
 held that position at the time of Bloody Sunday, when 14 civil rights 
protesters were killed by British paratroopers in the city.

During
 the Saville Inquiry into the events of that day, Paddy Ward claimed 
McGuinness had personally handed him bomb parts, an allegation 
McGuinness claimed was 'fantasy'.

In 1973, he was convicted by 
Ireland's Special Criminal Court, after being caught with a car  loaded 
with explosives and ammunition. He refused to recognise the court, and 
was sentenced to six months imprisonment.

However, he
 has never denied his role in the IRA, saying in September last year: ‘I
 didn’t say I never fired a gun - I was in the IRA. There were battles 
on the streets of Derry.'

However, when asked if he had killed anyone, he answered no.

He
 claims he left the Provisionals in 1974 to pursue a career in politics -
 five years before the IRA assassinated Lord Mountbatten.
