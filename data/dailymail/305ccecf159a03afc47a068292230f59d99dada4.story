Despite news of the first Ebola case inside the United States, there are no travel restrictions from the White House, it has been reported.

The Hill reported that White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said  containment methods already in place are adequate on Wednesday. Both West Africa screenings and US passenger monitoring are part of those methods, the website explained.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Tuesday that the patient, since identified as Thomas Eric Duncan, did not show symptoms during his flight from Liberia to the United States - and was therefore not contagious.

The Hill reported Earnest also said 'We've provided guidance to pilots, flight attendants and others who are responsible for staffing our transportation infrastructure to ensure that if they notice individuals who are exhibiting symptoms ... that the proper authorities are notified.

'In light of this incident, the administration has taken the step of re-circulating our guidance ... to make sure people are aware there is an important protocol that should be implemented.'

Earnest explained the unlikeliness of a massive outbreak, saying 'The reason for that is that it is not possible to transmit Ebola through the air. ... The only way that an individual can contract Ebola is by coming into contact with the bodily fluids of someone who is exhibiting symptoms,' according to The Hill.

Duncan is currently isolated at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas. 

Last Friday, President Barack Obama told representatives of more than 40 countries attending a global health summit at the White House that in an interconnected world, outbreaks of deadly viruses like Ebola have the potential to affect every nation.

The president said that while the U.S. is taking 'an opportunity to lead' the response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, it must also be a global priority.

The president said it's crucial to make sure the world is not 'caught flat-footed' if there are future outbreaks of deadly viruses.
