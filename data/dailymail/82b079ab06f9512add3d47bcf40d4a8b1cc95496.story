We're more accustomed to seeing her waving from the back of a stately Rolls-Royce driven sedately by a chauffeur.

But the Queen ditched her driver and was spotted behind the wheel yesterday as she joined the rest of the Royal family on a grouse shoot on the Balmoral estate.

Looking relaxed in her Range Rover, the monarch ferried a car full across the estate to the grouse moors.

Family affair: The Queen joined the rest of the family for lunch on the Grouse Moors at Balmoral where she spends two months of the summer each year

Her Majesty is known to be a keen driver following her time as a driver and mechanic in the Women's Auxillary Territorial Service during the Second World War.

She is the only person in the UK who is permitted to drive without a licence and is not obliged to have registration plates on her vehicles.

Although the Queen is said to enjoy driving, she tends to restrict her time on the road to visits to her private estates.

Also pictured driving to the shoot in a separate Range Rover was Prince Phillip who joined the Queen at the Aberdeenshire castle last month after recovering from abdominal surgery.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had flown up to Balmoral on a Â£14million Cessna 750 private jet earlier in the week to take Prince George to meet his great-grandfather Prince philip for the first time.

The newborn prince's first visit to the Queen's Scottish estate offered the opportunity for a unique family photo to be taken.

For the first time in more than a century, the family photo will feature three generations of heirass to the throne - Prince Charles, 64, Prince William, 31, and newborn George.

Charles and Camilla have also been staying at their nearby home, Birkhall, this week.

The Royal family have also been joined for the weekend by New Zealand Prime Minister John Key and his family.

It is thought that Mr Key is the first Kiwi premier to visit the castle.

The Queen traditionally spends two months of the summer at Balmoral from the end of July until the end of September.
