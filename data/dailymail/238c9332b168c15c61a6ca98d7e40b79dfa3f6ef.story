Graphic video footage has emerged of three Los Angeles police officers shooting dead a homeless man on a sidewalk in broad daylight after shouting 'drop the gun!'

The clip, described by an LAPD commander as 'disturbing', was posted online within a few hours of Sunday's incident by the passer-by who filmed it. It comes in the wake of several fatal  shootings in the US by on-duty police officers.

At the start of the footage four officers are seen struggling to apprehend a man on Skid Row, an area in LA where many of the city's homeless stay. He is seen wheeling around trying to strike the officers.

They eventually wrestle him to the ground amid a collection of sleeping bags as two more officers sprint to the scene. While two police detain a nearby female who picked up one of their dropped batons, another can be heard shouting: 'Drop the gun! Drop the gun!'

Shot dead: Los Angeles police were seen shooting dead a homeless man on Sunday at midday

Altercation: At the beginning of the clip, the man is seeing taking swings at several police officers on Skid Row

Two officers then breakaway to subdue a woman who had picked up one of their dropped batons as their colleagues struggle with the violent man 

A Taser is heard being discharged before five gun shots are fired, leaving the man lying motionless, face down.

The three officers, one of whom is a sergeant, shot the man as they struggled on the ground for control of one of the police officer's weapons, after a stun gun proved ineffective, LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith said. They were answering a report of a robbery at midday on Sunday. 

Smith said the department was aware of the video, and would attempt to amplify its sound and pictures to figure out exactly what happened.

'The video is disturbing,' Smith said at a briefing with reporters late Sunday night. 'It's disturbing any time anyone loses their life. It's a tragedy.'

Smith said at least one of the officers was also wearing a body camera. 

The homeless man, who has not been formally identified, was later declared dead at a hospital.

The fatal shooting took place in Skid Row at lunchtime on Sunday 

The shooting in Skid Row came during a national debate about police use of force after several killings by on-duty police officers.

In November rookie cop Peter Liang shot dead an unarmed black man, Akai Gurley, as they patrolled a housing estate in Brooklyn, New York.

Police claim that Liang appeared to accidentally fire a shot when he was about 10 feet from the 28-year-old without saying a word.

Prosecutors alleged that Liang's first concern was that he 'was going to be fired' while Mr Gurley's friend fought alone to keep him alive and was forced to find a neighbor to call 911.

He has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter.

The killings of two unarmed blacks by white police officers in Missouri and New York last summer touched off protests over police conduct that intensified after grand juries refused to indict the officers.

Tensions escalated further after two New York City police officers were killed by a man who suggested in online posts that their deaths were in retaliation for the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York City. The gunman committed suicide.

Garner, who was put in a chokehold by an officer, was heard gasping, 'I can't breathe' before he lost consciousness and later died.

Black teenager Brown, 18, was shot and killed by white officer Darren Wilson, who claimed he was acting in self-defense. The shooting set off days of racially-charged protests.

The violence Sunday had echoes of the August shooting by Los Angeles police of 25-year-old Ezell Ford, whose death in a struggle with officers brought demonstrations in the city.

Ford was unarmed, but police officers said he was shot only after reaching for an officer's gun.

On the video,  shot by a man called Anthony Blackburn, witnesses yell: 'Motherf***er! Motherf***er! They just killed that man!' as more officers pull up and order the crowds to disperse.

'Ain't nobody got no motherf***ing gun!' shouted one witness as he filmed the incident, which took place in front of the Union Rescue Mission, 545 S. San Pedro St.

Mr Blackburn's video had been viewed 4.3 million times over the first 12 hours that it was posted.

Witnesses told the Los Angeles Times that the man is known on the street in the area as 'Africa,' and that he had been there for four or five months after spending time in a mental health institute.

One witness, Jose Gil, 38, told the Times he saw the man swinging at police then heard one of them shout, 'he's got my gun!' before the shots were fired.

Dennis Horne, 29, said the man had been fighting with someone else in his tent before officers arrived.

'It's sad,' Horne said. 'There's no justification to take somebody's life.'

Pastor Wayne Gaddis, president of the Baptist Convention, President of the California Missionary Baptist State Convention, told CBS Los Angeles: 'We do not support police brutality. But we do support the police department.

Tents and cardboard shelters cover the sidewalks of Skid Row, the downtown neighborhood where an estimated 1,700 homeless people live. Many of them struggle with mental illness and addiction.

Police Commission President Steve Soboroff said the independent inspector general and the district attorney had all begun investigating the incident.

Earl Ofari Hutchinson, head of the activist group the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, called on the Police Commission to hold special hearing on use of force by officers in Skid Row encounters.

Hutchinson said in a statement that the shooting 'underscores the need for the police commission to hold a special hearing to fully examine police tactics and training in the use of deadly force by LAPD officers involving skid row residents many of whom have major mental challenges.'

Other recent deaths during police actions in New York and in Ferguson, Missouri, and the lack of prosecution of the officers involved, have brought nationwide protest.

The violence Sunday had echoes of the August shooting by Los Angeles police of 25-year-old Ezell Ford, whose death in a struggle with officers brought demonstrations in the city.

Ford was unarmed, but police officers said he was shot only after reaching for an officer's gun.
