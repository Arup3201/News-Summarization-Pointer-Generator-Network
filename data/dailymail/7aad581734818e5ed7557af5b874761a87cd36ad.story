Wesleyan University's president has urged students to 'turn in the drug dealers' after 12 people - 10 students and two visitors - were hospitalized after taking party drug 'molly'. 

In a letter to the campus President Michael Roth said:  'If you are aware of people distributing these substances, please let someone know before more people are hurt.'

The school became aware of the problem early on Sunday morning after several students showed up seeking treatment at a Middlesex Hospital near the campus.

In his letter Roth included a telephone number students can call to make a confidential report.

'These drugs can be altered in ways that make them all the more toxic. Take a stand to protect your fellow students,' he wrote.

Two students were described as being in a critical condition and were airlifted for treatment in Hartford, 20 miles north of the campus in Middletown.

Two others were taken by ambulance to Hartford Hospital in a serious condition and four more were expected to be released from Middlesex yesterday, Roth said.

Molly is a term used to describe a refined form of Ecstasy, a synthetic drug also known as MDMA. 

It can drive up body temperature and cause liver, kidney or cardiovascular failure.

Dr. Mark Neavyn, chief of toxicology at Hartford Hospital, said users who believe they are taking molly are often receiving different kinds of designer drugs with ranges of purity and potency making the health risks unpredictable. 

He said testing is underway to confirm what drugs the Wesleyan patients took.

'When we see these people in the emergency department and they claim to have taken molly, we don't pay attention to that word anymore.

'It's so commonly not MDMA, we just start from square one and say it's some sort of drug abuse,' Neavyn said. 

Wesleyan health officials said in a campus-wide email on September 16 that students had been hospitalized  after taking molly.

Students were urged to visit the school's health center if they had questions or concerns.

Some of the students who required medical attention over the weekend had attended a rave at the school's Eclectic Society social house.  

Middletown police Chief William McKenna said his department was pursing information about a 'bad batch' of the drug.

'Our first and foremost goal is to obtain information on the batch of Molly that was distributed to the students on the campus,' McKenna said.

'This information is critical in ensuring the recovery of those students affected.'

The school's administration have asked students  to check on their friends and make sure they aren't in danger. 

In the last five years molly has made its way into popular culture, helped by references to it by entertainers such as Madonna, Miley Cyrus and Kanye West.

The drug's dangers became more clear after a rash of overdoses in recent years. 

Over the last few years, drugs sold under the name molly have 'flooded' the market, said Rusty Payne, a spokesman with the Drug Enforcement Administration.

In some states there has been a 100-fold increase - the combined number of arrests, seizures, emergency room mentions and overdoses - between 2009 and 2012, according to DEA figures.

The drug is marketed to recreational drug users who believe it is less dangerous than its predecessor, which was often cut with other substances. 

A total of 12 people - 10 Wesleyan students and two visitors - received medical attention over the weekend after taking what id believed to be party drug Molly. Police believe a bad batch may be in circulation
