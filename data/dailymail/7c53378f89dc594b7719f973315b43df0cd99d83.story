Winner: Bruce Crawcour may have set a legal precedent he won a payout from travel giant Thomson Holidays in a landmark legal case which could pave the way for thousands of out-of-pocket holidaymakers to claim compensation

A grandfather has won a full refund from travel giant Thomson Holidays in a landmark legal case that could see thousands of out-of-pocket holidaymakers claim compensation.

Bruce Crawcour, 66, launched his battle with parent company TUI Travel after he was forced to cancel a holiday when his wife Kay, 63, fell ill.

Instead they charged him the full £2,256 for the two-week break the couple were due to have last May in Majorca at the luxury Protur Biomar Gran Hotel.

But the retired civil servant managed to prove the company was not out of pocket after the flights and hotel room vanished from the Thomson website before the departure date. He argued this meant they had managed to sell the package on.

On Wednesday, he became one of the first holidaymakers in the UK to be awarded damages from a tour operator for a cancelled holiday. The pensioner, who represented himself at Telford Small Claims Court, was awarded a full refund as well as £300 court costs.

The ruling could now spell major changes for holidaymakers who follow suit and sue travel firms over cancellation clauses in package holiday contracts.

Experts believe it may force tour operators to change their policies on late cancellation fees. Yesterday Mr Crawcour, said: ‘My wife was admitted to hospital on a Monday and we were due to fly on the Sunday. I called up to tell TUI that we needed to cancel, as she was not fit to travel.

‘We had booked a holiday plus a private taxi from Palma airport costing £150. I asked a girl on the customer services desk if she could cancel the taxi to save me money.

‘However, she said no – that anything I had paid on my final invoice was final. I thought that was extremely unreasonable, as I was phoning six days in advance.

According to the Citizens Advice bureau: 'Under package holiday regulations you only have the right to cancel if your organiser has made major changes to your holiday.

'If your organiser hasn’t made any changes to your holiday your right to cancel will depend on the terms and conditions of your holiday contract. You may be able to cancel your holiday but your organiser might charge you a cancellation fee.

'You will normally be able to find information about your organiser’s cancellation policy in your holiday brochure or with your booking information'.

‘I then decided to track on the TUI website what happened to the components of our holiday, and within 24 hours our plane seats were unavailable and within four days our hotel room was unavailable. They had basically robbed us blind.’

Mr Crawcour, from Shrewsbury, argued in court that the company breached the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contract Regulations 1999 and guidance from the Office of Fair Trading on Unfair Contract Terms in Package Holiday Contracts.

He added: ‘That meant that operators can impose a sliding scale of charges which increase as the departure date approaches, only if they can prove they have had a pre estimate of the holiday company’s loss.’

Mr Crawcour believes that if the simple task of cancelling the taxi had been done, TUI would never have had to answer to his claims.

TUI immediately appealed to the High Court after the ruling, although the father of four said he plans to fight again.

He said: ‘It is a David versus Goliath win, definitely. TUI had a specialist travel lawyer up from London representing them, I was representing myself. I am very pleased my hard work paid off.

Legal fight: Mr Crawcour said he and his wife were looking forward to a break in Majorca (pictured) but six days before she fell ill and they were forced to cancel, sparking the litigation

‘The only reason I went ahead with 
this is because they didn’t cancel the taxi. If they had done that I 
would have been OK and accepted it, but it was just a trigger that I 
acted on and it opened a huge can of worms.

‘I do hope people read about what has happened and stand up for themselves a bit more and do what I did.

‘There are thousands of people this has affected before me.’

A TUI spokesman said: ‘We note the court’s decision in the case of Mr Crawcour. We have obtained leave to appeal the decision and as such it would be inappropriate to comment further.’
