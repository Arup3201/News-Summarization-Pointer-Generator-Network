A man gave drivers along the Pacific Coast Highway an eyeful on Tuesday when he had a bizarre naked meltdown on top of his luxury electric sports car.

The unidentified man caused a huge traffic snarl around 3pm after he parked his red Tesla Model S in the middle of the road got out and proceeded to strip as he ran around his eco-friendly vehicle.

Ambulance and fire department officials arrived just in time to see him get back in his $70,000 car, awkwardly climb out the sun-roof and give them a full-on show as he gesticulated his arms wildly and swung his hips.

Hello: The naked man prepares to lift himself out of his Tesla Model S car on the Pacific Coast Highway on Tuesday

In video filmed at the scene, authorities can be seen patiently trying to talk him down from the car, while his unusual naked performance carries on.

Flapping his arms around and seemingly making out kung-fu style moves, the man seems totally oblivious to the fact he is on a major road artery just outside Los Angeles.

Eventually, the police arrived and took him away, and Captain Oscar Scott of the Pacific Palisades Fire Station 69 told the Palisadian Post that he may have had a 'meltdown or psychiatric episode or was on a controlled substance.'

Indeed, the full display last almost 30 minutes and the man who videoed the scene, Teddy Bliss, told the New York Daily News he only caught a very small part.

Whoops: The man's attempt to get out his car fails as he falls back through the sun-roof

'This all started when the guy driving the Tesla stopped in the middle of the PCH and jumped out of the car! Running around waving a shirt, acting like something was wrong with his Tesla,' he wrote in an email to the Daily News.

The man began jumping on his roof, breaking the glass, before getting back in and driving dangerously through the traffic before crashing.

After this, he ran away from his car, taking off his clothes before returning to his car, which is when Bliss began to film.

'At this point the ambulance and Fire Department arrived to the scene. They were not able to stop him!' wrote Bliss.

'The man then went back to the Tesla where he began to go crazy,‚Äù and Bliss said he began filming.

'After I shot the video the Police finally came and they had to put the man in a restriction jacket and wrap him with blankets while loading him onto a stretcher,' Bliss concluded.
