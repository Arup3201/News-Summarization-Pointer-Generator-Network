A successful lawyer working for a high-profile law firm recently turned in a departure memo saying that she could no longer juggle her work and family responsibilities.

The woman, identified only as Mrs X, wrote a heart-wrenching email to her co-workers at law firm Clifford Chance in Washington, D.C., spelling out her 20-hour days filled with stress, spit-up, and sine qua nons.

Her letter, obtained by blog Above The Law, spells out a typical day for the working mother, which begins at 4am and didn’t end until 1:30am the next day, punctuated with long commutes, meetings, and parenting duties that go well into the night.

Having it all? One lawyer in Washington wrote in a resignation email that she could no longer do 20-hour days juggling work and family (stock photo)

Mrs X begins her departure memo with a play-by-play of how she spent a typical day, starting at 4am with checking in on her crying child, and ending only after hours of exhausting meetings, commuting children to and from daycare, and answering thousands of emails on her BlackBerry.

By 7:30am, the working mother had already made her children breakfast, dressed them, and changed the sheets of her young son, who wet the bed.

She writes: ‘Realize that I am still in my pajamas and haven’t showered, so pull my hair back in a ponytail and throw on a suit.’ She won't have the chance to shower until 1:30 the next morning.

Then, Mrs X writes, it’s time for the daily commute, complete with congestion and her infant child spitting up on her suit.

By 9:20, she manages to get her children to daycare, gets to the office, and dials in five minutes late to a conference call. From that point on, her day is a blur of client calls, meetings, endless to-do lists, and of course, emails.

At 2pm, she explains: ‘Realize I forgot to eat lunch, so go to the 9th floor kitchen to score some leftovers.’ Only a half hour later, she receives a ‘frantic’ email from one of her clients demanding an answer to a question that day.

Mrs X writes that she has to pick up her children from daycare by 5:30pm. For every minute late, she must pay $5 per child. Following a 5:50pm pickup, the frazzled mother faces rush-hour traffic and her two children hungry and screaming in the back of the vehicle.

All work and no play: The mother, Mrs X, worked at the Washington, D.C. branch of Clifford Chance

By 7:15, she makes a quick dinner of microwaved chicken nuggets for her family, bathes her children (after losing a negotiation with her husband), and puts them to bed. But her day is far from over.

After the children are asleep, she checks emails and does even more work. At one point, she dozes off and makes coffee. She manages to find time to shower at 1am (‘Lord knows I won’t have time in the morning,’ she writes), and is asleep by 1:30.

The memo then says: ‘REPEAT.’

Argument: The question of whether women can have it all was famously questioned by Ann-Marie Slaughter in the July/August issue of The Atlantic

Mrs X then wrote that she ‘truly admires all of you that have been able to juggle your career and family and do not envy what a challenge it is trying to do each well.’

Above The Law’s Elie Mystal observed that maintaining such a gruelling schedule day to day is simply impossible. ‘You’ve got to keep going back and forth, not just in terms of where you are, but also in terms of your focus,’ she wrote.

Mrs X’s time-crunch dilemma is part of a much larger topic that touches on a buzz-worthy subject – if the working woman can ‘have it all.’

The Huffington Post’s Lisa Belkin wrote that especially in law, the workplace is ‘a 1950s model set in a 2012 world,’ requiring workers to put in extreme hours ‘with no distractions, because there is someone (traditionally a wife) at home to sort out the rest of their lives.’

Ms Belkin goes on to say that this model is intrinsically flawed, as the new model is that of a dual-income household, with both parents working out of necessity.  That leaves women - the traditional caregiver - dual responsibility.

The Atlantic’s Anne-Marie Slaughter stoically rejected that a work-life balance was possible for working moms in the much-debated cover story from the July/August issue of the magazine. 

Ms Slaughter worked as a high-profile government official but noted in the article she had little time for her family. 

‘I still strongly believe that women can “have it all” (and that men can too),’ she wrote. ’But not today, not with the way America’s economy and society are currently structured.

'My experiences over the past three years have forced me to confront a number of uncomfortable facts that need to be widely acknowledged—and quickly changed.’

A day in the life of Ms. X (and many others here, I presume):

4:00am: Hear baby screaming, hope I am dreaming, realize I’m not, sleep walk to nursery, give her a pacifier and put her back to sleep

5:30am: Alarm goes off, hit snooze

6:00am: See the shadow of a small person standing at my bedroom door, realize it is my son who has wet the bed (time to change the sheets)

6:15am: Hear baby screaming, make a bottle, turn on another excruciating episode of Backyardigans, feed baby

7:00am: Find some clean clothes for the kids, get them dressed

7:30am: Realize that I am still in my pajamas and haven’t showered, so pull hair back in a ponytail and throw on a suit

8:00am: Pile into the car, drive the kids to daycare

9:00am: finally arrive at daycare, baby spits up on suit, get kids to their classrooms, realize I have a conference call in 15 minutes

9:20am: Run into my office, dial-in to conference call 5 minutes late and realize that no one would have known whether or not I was on the call, but take notes anyway

9:30am: Get an email that my time is late, Again! Enter my time

10:00am: Team meeting; leave with a 50-item to-do list

2:00pm: Realize I forgot to eat lunch, so go to the 9th floor kitchen to score some leftovers

5:00pm: receive conflicting comments from Senior Associate and Partner (one in new version and one in track changes); attempt to reconcile; send redline

5:30pm: wait for approval to send response to client; realize that I am going to be late picking up the kids from daycare ($5 for each minute late)

6:00pm: race to daycare to get the kids (they are the last two there)

6:30pm: TRAFFIC with a side of screaming kids who are starving

7:15pm: Finally arrive home, throw chicken nuggets in the microwave, feed the family

7:45pm: Negotiate with husband over who will do bathtime and bedtime routine; lose

8:00pm: Bath, pajamas, books, bed

9:00pm: Kids are finally asleep, check blackberry and have 25 unread messages

11:30pm: Wake up and realize I fell asleep at my desk; make more coffee; get through task number three

1:00am: Jump in the shower (lord knows I won’t have time in the morning)

1:30am: Finally go to bed

REPEAT
