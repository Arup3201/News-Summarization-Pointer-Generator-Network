Chick-fil-A have stopped including Jim Henson Company toys in their children’s meals due to a ‘possible safety issue.’

The restaurant appear to have pulled the Jim Henson Creature Shop toys from their meals after the company behind The Muppets severed ties with Chick-fil-A over the eatery’s anti-gay marriage stance.

Chick-A-fill’s recall notice says ‘there have been some reports of children getting their fingers stuck in the holes of the puppets.’

The sign is dated July 19, one day before Jim Henson Company announced that it would not do business with them again following Chick-fil-A president Dan Cathy's comments that his company supported families headed by heterosexual couples only.

Tit-for-tat? Chick-fil-A have stopped including Jim Henson Company toys in their children's meals due to a 'possible safety issue'. The recall came at the same time the Jim Henson Company severed ties with Chick-fil-A over the eatery's anti-gay marriage stance

However, it is not clear when the signs were actually put up in restaurants, reported Gawker.

The Jim Henson Company had partnered with the eatery to provide toys in their kid’s meals from mid July until August 18.  

And following Cathy's inflammatory newspaper interview more controversial rhetoric has surfaced, according to Gawker.

Cathy is heard telling attendees at 
Hope Community Church in Raleigh, North Carolina, that a lack of 
religion has led to ‘twisted up kind of stuff’ like 'Washington trying 
to redefine the definition of marriage.'

The Jim Henson Company, which is 
also behind popular shows such as Fraggle Rock and Labyrinth, posted 
that their were severing their ties with the restaurant on their 
Facebook page on July 20.

The company also said they would be 
dedicating their payment from Chick-Fil-A to the charity Gay & 
Lesbian Alliance Against Discrimination. 

Their full post, reported on the Huffington Post, read: 'The Jim Henson 
Company has celebrated and embraced diversity and inclusiveness for over
fifty years and we have notified Chick-Fil-A that we do not wish to 
partner with them on any future endeavors.

'Lisa Henson, our CEO is 
personally a strong supporter of gay marriage and has directed us to 
donate the payment we received from Chick-Fil-A to GLAAD.'

'Going forward': The Atlanta-based fast food chain released a statement on Facebook saying they will 'leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena'

This is the latest in a huge backlash 
to comments made by the multimillion dollar empire’s president Dan Cathy
when he said his company is ‘very much supportive of the family,’ but 
only when it involves heterosexual couples in an interview with the 
conservative newspaper Baptist Press.

As well as customer backlash, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino has vowed to block Chick-fil-A from opening a restaurant in the city.

To appease disgruntled consumers 
Chick-fil-A issued a statement via the company's Facebook page on 
Thursday saying their restaurants ‘treat every person with honor, 
dignity and respect – regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual 
orientation or gender’.

The statement continued: ‘Going forward,
our intent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the 
government and political arena.’

More than 13,000 comments were posted on the company's Facebook page in response to the statement.

According to the Los Angeles Times, Mr Cathy he previously said: ‘We are a family-owned business, a family-led business, and we are
married to our first wives.’

Contradictory: Mr Cathy's backing of 'traditional' families as husband and wife is a far cry from the ensuing statement from Chick-fil-A

The Atlanta-based business currently has 1,608 locations and boasts sales of more than $4billion.

According to the Los Angeles Times, Chick-fil-A workers are trained ‘to focus on values rooted in the Bible,’ and the eateries nationwide are closed on Sundays.

Mr Cathy said: ‘We don’t claim to be a Christian business. 

‘Companies are not lost or saved, but certainly individuals are but as an organisation we can operate on biblical principles.’

In response to Chick-fil-A's Facebook statement there was a range of criticism and support for the company's position.

One user posted: 'I believe that anytime a person or a
business uses their time and money to ensure that someone does not have
an ability or a right they are not acting with grace, only with selfish intent and fear.'

Another posted: 'You can stop eating there if you want but I don't think he should have to change his values and beliefs.

'You want you rights to be "gay" but you want to take our right to believe what we want from us?'

On Twitter user posted: ‘I shall not ever eat at chick-a-fil-a again.’

The company, founded in 1946 by 
Cathy’s father, S. Truett Cathy, has also come under fire for donating more 
than $3million between 2003 and 2009 to Christian organisations with a 
well-known anti-gay agenda, among them the Marriage & Family 
Foundation and the Family Research Council.

According to a report from LGBT advocacy group Equality Matters, in 2010 alone Chick-fil-A gave nearly $2million to such causes.
