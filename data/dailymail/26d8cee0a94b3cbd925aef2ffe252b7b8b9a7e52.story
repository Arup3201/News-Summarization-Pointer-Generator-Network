A 24-year-old pitcher in California as just been signed by the Minnesota Twins and already his story seems ready-made for a Hollywood movie.

Brandon Poulson throws 100mph fastballs, he ran a 60-yard dash in 6.6 seconds in his stocking feet and has a 40-inch vertical jump.

And before he was discovered by major league scouts, he was splitting his time between pitching for the Healdsburg Prune Packers in Northern California's wine country and driving a front-loader for his dad's company - John's Excavating.

'I played for the Prune Packers summer of 2013, but missed nearly three-fourths of the games because I was busy 
working,' said Poulson, who didn’t make his high school baseball team as
 a freshman.

Flamethrower: Brandon Poulson stand 6-foot-6 and pitches at a blistering 100mph

Poulson went un-drafted and un-noticed. He was even on the verge of quitting sports. He played baseball and football in junior college, but was just about to end the dream and move back home to take over his father's business.

'It’s a great story. This kid came out of nowhere,' Twins West Coast scouting supervisor Sean Johnson said Tuesday.

This week the Twins signed Poulson for $250,000 - ten times the market rate for an un-drafted pitching prospect. They sent him to their rookie league in Elizabethton, Tennessee, where the team hopes his flamethrower arm will develop into a devastating weapon for the major leagues.

Poulson missed much of last season because he was working for his father

'He's like Ivan Drago. You know that scene in Rocky IV: "Whatever he hits… he destroys." That's what he reminds me of,' Twins Elliott Strankman told Yahoo Sports.

To top it all off, when asked what he planned to do with his new-found wealth, Poulson said his first major purchase will be a therapy device to help his father with his disabetes.

The Twins knew about Poulson from his recent season with Academy of Art University, where he had an 8.38 ERA for the San Francisco school.

Poulson played there after taking a couple of years off to work in his father’s business - 'John’s Excavating' - with the thought he’d take it over someday and leave athletics behind for good.

The 6-foot-6 right-hander previously played baseball, but chose football at Santa Rosa Junior College.

Poulson travelled to Minneapolis last week to undergo a physical at Target Field before returning to Northern California, then was cleared Tuesday. He was set to travel Wednesday to the Twins’ rookie club in the Appalachian League in 

Poulson will sign his contract once he reports. He could pitch in a game as soon as this weekend.

Until last fall, Poulson was operating heavy machinery - driving 18-wheelers, front-loaders and backhoes. All the while, he played baseball in a Sunday night men’s league, fittingly called the 'Wine Country' league.

'I went to work with my father and didn’t want to gamble with sports anymore,' Poulson said.

He later changed his mind and decided to give baseball one last try, spending months retooling his delivery with Prune Packers pitching coach Caleb Balbuena.

Poulson’s stats this summer: 31 strikeouts and six hits in 12.1 innings, with four saves in 12 appearances.

The Twins consider him among the best athletes they have pursued: a health nut, Poulson weighs 240 pounds and ran a 6.6-second 60-yard dash. He has a 40-inch vertical leap.

The San Francisco Giants wanted to sign Poulson, who also drew interest from the Oakland Athletics, Seattle Mariners and Philadelphia Phillies. Those teams didn’t have enough money remaining in their draft pool to match Minnesota.

Poulson is going into the Twins minor league farm system in the hopes that his flamethrower arm develops into a major league-caliber weapon

'He’s a physical specimen. He’s got the best pure arm strength I’ve ever seen,' Twins scout Elliott Strankman said.

Strankman is the only member of the organization who watched Poulson pitch. It took all of 18 throws to convince him.

'We’re cautiously optimistic because we don’t want to put a bunch of pressure on the kid. He could be pretty good. This is uncharted territory for us,' he said.

At Academy of Art’s scout day, only the position players were running 60-yard dashes until Poulson turned up and insisted on sprinting. He hadn’t warmed up and was wearing only socks.

'I had cold legs,' he said. 'Maybe I would have run it faster.'

Strankman went to see him pitch for the Prune Packers on July 15. Poulson reached agreement on a contract two days later.

This week, Poulson is headed for the minor leagues.

'I’m excited,' he said. 'I know it’s just the first step of what the real goal is, to make it in the bigs.'

Poulson went 0-0 with a high ERA in 14 appearances and 19.1 innings for Academy of Art this season. He struck out 24, walked 24 and opponents hit .189 against him.

The Twins, who selected shortstop Nick Gordon with the fifth overall pick in last month’s draft, had the financial flexibility to pull this off.

'It was a group effort. You just don’t see stuff like this every day,' Strankman said.

'It’s one of those great days as a scout you hope you have every five years.'
