Packed in to the Macazinho stadium, next to the world-famous Maracana in Rio De Janeiro, it was a day of celebration for the 1,960 couples present.

With the women showing off their elegant dresses and the men looking dapper in suits, they came together for Rio's biggest mass wedding.

The annual event, called 'The Day of I Do', is aimed at helping low-income couples who cannot afford to pay for a wedding. Couples with a monthly family income of up to $1,000 (£640) were allowed to take part.

Promoted by the local authorities, special commuter trains dubbed the 'I Do Day Train' were booked for the couples and their guests. 

The joyous occasion was attended by 12,000 in total, including brides, grooms, friends, families and authorities. Volunteer civil judges presided over the ceremony.  

Couples were also blessed by a Roman Catholic bishop and a Christian evangelical pastor.

The yearly event has been running for eight years and takes place next to the Maracana, which hosted the World Cup final between Germany and Argentina this summer. 

One of the men waiting to tie the knot, Emerson Moraes, 34, told O Globo newspaper: 'We got up at 06:00. There are so many people and I think we will be here for a while, but I'm very happy.'

Mr Moraes has been with Ana Rosangela Azevedo, 31, since 2010 and earlier this year they decided to formalise their relationship.
