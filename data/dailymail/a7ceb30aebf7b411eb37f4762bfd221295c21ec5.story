North Korea's ambassador to the UK has issued a chilling warning that his country would be prepared to use nuclear weapons. 

In a rare interview, Hyun Hak-bong claimed the secretive state could launch a deadly warhead 'anytime'.

Speaking to Sky News at the North Korean embassy in west London, he said: 'We are prepared.

'If a sparkle of a fire is made on the Korean peninsula, it will lead to a nuclear war.

'We don't say empty words. We mean what we mean. It is not the United States that has a monopoly on nuclear weapons strikes.'

When asked to clarify if North Korea had the ability to fire a nuclear missile, Mr Hak-bong confirmed: 'Anytime, anytime, yes.'

He did add that North Koreans were a 'peace-loving people' and the communist country would only launch a nuclear attack in the event of an American first strike. 

The threat comes against the backdrop of annual US/South Korean military exercises which the North views as preparation for a possible invasion.

The Foal Eagle and Key Resolve exercises last several weeks and involve hundreds of thousands of troops.

America claims they are defensive but Pyongyang considers them a provocation.

In the same interview Mr Hak-bong also launched a vicious attack on defectors from the North.

He said of those who have managed to escape the regime of dictator Kim Jong-un: 'Do you know the difference between human beings and animals?

'Human beings have a conscience and morality. If they do not have a conscience and a morality the are like nothing.

'They're animals. That is why we call the defectors animals. They are no better than animals. They're human scum.'

The allegations came after the United Nations launched yet another investigation into North Korea's human rights record. 

The UN is also planning to investigate reports that up to 20,000 North Koreans have been sent to Qatar to help build the 2022 World Cup facilities under inhumane conditions.
