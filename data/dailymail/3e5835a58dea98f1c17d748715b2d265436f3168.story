An incredibly rare sighting has been captured by Southern Cross University scientists of a rare Australian dolphin species.

The elusive aquatic animal shows some rather unusual behaviour is known for by beaching itself in order to feed.

A pod of Australian humpback dolphins was spotted by the scientists in the Fitzroy River estuary of Central Queensland.

The research team led by Dr Daniele Cagnazzi, of the University’s Marine Ecology Research Centre said that large splashed in the distance is what caught the group’s attention.

‘We soon realised we were witnessing an incredible event,’ she said. ‘The humpback dolphins were observed swimming a few metres away from the shoreline.’

This behaviour allows dolphins to concentrate fish against the mud bank before charging at them at high speed.

On some occasions the fish were washed onto the shoreline by the wave of water associated with the dolphin's beaching, resulting in a full body exposed beaching.

While other times it was only partially beached with more than half of their body exposed.

‘In these shallow waters the agility of the dolphin’s neck region enabled them to reach for the stranded fish before sliding back into the deeper water, thanks to the soft mud.’

Three years ago, the research team spotted a similar occurrence at the Fitzroy River.

They saw an animal which appeared to be stranded and dead on a mud bank however upon a closer look they realised the animal was alive as it slid back into the water.

The Fitzroy River’s network of narrow deep creeks and channels with steep muddy edges provides the perfect habitat for the display of this behaviour.

Prior to this, the only other written report of beach hunting behaviour in Australian humpback dolphins was in 2007 near Cape Van Diemen in the Northern Territory.

Dr Cagnazzi and her team’s discovery shows that hunting and foraging techniques have advanced from just hunting in the comforts of the water but are able to corner their prey out of the water.

The behaviour also shows evidence of social learning or even a learning culture. 

Until now, the rare ‘beach hunting’ behaviour has been documented in only two species: the Orca in Argentina; and bottlenose dolphins in Georgia and South Carolina in the US, Sado Estuary in Portugal, and Shark Bay and Peron Peninsula in Western Australia.

The research team will keep collecting information to better understand the factors promoting this behaviour.
