Naked cop: Andy Easterby sparked a police chase after being spotted behind the wheel, in the nude

A former PC sparked a dangerous police chase after he was spotted driving naked following a seaside romp with his girlfriend.

Shamed Andy Easterby sped off from officers who spotted him driving in the nude, leading his former colleagues on a chaotic car chase through Scarborough town centre at 3am.

The 30-year-old was eventually caught crouching behind a wheelie bin ‘sporting nothing but a pair of shoes and socks’ after trying to evade capture.

Yesterday the former York police officer was jailed for six months after pleading guilty to dangerous driving.

A court heard, with smoking tyres, Easterby twice went through No Entry signs, driving the wrong way down several one-way streets, and turning off his headlights in a bid to get away from officers.

York Crown Court heard Easterby and his girlfriend had been on a day trip to the North Yorkshire resort when he’d taken off his clothes to have sex with her in their car.

But the former officer, who was forced to resign from the force after being caught drink driving, was spotted by a CCTV operator who tipped off police after spotting Easterby was driving naked as he drove through the town centre at 3am on April 25.

Two armed officers approached and ordered Easterby, who had just romped with his then partner in her car, to stop where he was.

But, while his girlfriend sat in the passenger seat, he reversed away before leading the officers on the high speed chase through Scarborough town centre.

The former York PC sped the wrong way down three one-way streets and went through two entry signs to lose the police officers.

He was eventually found crouching behind a wheelie bin after abandoning his car.

Chris Moran, defending, said Easterby’s actions had been committed out of embarrassment.

 ‘Two times in his life he has done 
something reckless, stupid and impulsive and both times he has paid a 
considerable price for it.’

It was the second time the former police officer had broken the law -in 2009, he was banned from driving for a year after he was caught drink-driving.

Following his drink-drive conviction, he 
was forced to resign from the police after eight years in the job that 
had been his childhood dream. He had just taken the sergeants’ exam.

Mr Moran, defending, said: ‘Two times in his life he has done something reckless, stupid and impulsive and both times he has paid a considerable price for it.’

Easterby, of Leeds, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving on Monday.

He was also banned from driving for three years and ordered to retake his driving test.

Judge Stephen Ashurst told the former neighbourhood police team member: ‘This is a difficult day, I know, for you.  

‘I have to take account not only of the strong personal mitigation in your case, but also the public interest in seeking to deter people from driving dangerously, particularly when they are pursued by police, where the sensible course is to stop.’
