Amid the crowning of a new world champion and another dazzling performance from Amir Khan, the Las Vegas Strip witnessed yet more farcical scoring on Saturday night.

At the end of a year blighted by bad decisions, ringside judges at the Cosmopolitan hotel were guilty of yet more glaring errors.

Ireland’s Andy Lee will be glad that he was spared such a fate as he stopped Matt Korobov to win the WBO middleweight crown.

But either side of his triumph, Mauricio Herrera and Timothy Bradley were left stunned when their scores were read out.

Bradley, who lost for the first time as a professional in April in his rematch with Manny Pacquiao, looked to have returned to winning ways against Diego Chaves.

But the three ringside judges all saw the fight differently with Julie Lederman scoring it 116-112 for Chaves, Burt Clements 115-113 for Bradley while Craig Metcalfe had 114-114, a draw, meaning the fight was called a tie.

Bradley felt he had won eight rounds but Chavez disagreed: ‘I felt I was the one who did most of the work in this fight. At the end of the fight I was the one who stepped up. I thought it was a close fight, but I thought I won the fight.’

Bradley’s promoter Bob Arum was scathing when asked about the judging.

‘I don’t understand anymore,’ he said. ‘Julie Lederman should not be allowed to judge in this state anymore. That was the worst decision. I had it 8-4 for Bradley. I could see it 7-5. OK, maybe even 114-114. But her scorecard for Chaves was an absolute disgrace.’

Earlier, Herrera looked to have done enough to edge out Jose Benavidez but was also denied by the judges.

He was justifiably aggrieved, especially considering many felt he was also hard done to when losing to world champion Danny Garcia in March.

‘This is nothing new,’ he said. ‘I win a fight and they take it away from me. They must not count body shots in this division.’

Benavidez was unmoved. ‘He was very aggressive, and I was catching him over and over as he was walking into my punches,’ he said. ‘I knew I won this fight. Everything worked for me. All my combinations. All my uppercuts. All my body shots. I landed everything.’
