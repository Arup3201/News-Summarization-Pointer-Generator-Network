The internet is facing its biggest ever threat, thanks in part of Facebook and Apple, the co-founder of Google has claimed.

Sergey Brin said government attempts to control web access and the rise of the increasingly 'restrictive' Facebook and Apple platforms threaten freedom of information online.

Mr Brin also said attempts by the entertainment industry to crack down on piracy have led to the U.S. using the same technology and approach it has criticised China and Iran for using.

Mr Brin told The Guardian: 'There are 
very powerful forces that have lined up against the open Internet on all
 sides and around the world.

'I am more worried than I have been in the past. It's scary.'

Mr Brin said the rise of 'walled 
garden' like Facebook and Apple, which tightly control what software can
 be released on their platforms, were restricting innovation online.

Both platforms have risen to become 
consumer giants with their own proprietary platforms which control 
access to their users and data.

The 38-year-old told The Guardian that
 he and Google co-founder Larry Page could not have created their search
 engine if the internet was dominated by Facebook.

With data stored on Facebook apps not 
searchable and only accessible to closed, restricted networks of users, 
the increasingly closed nature of the web risked stifline innovation, he
 said.

'There's a lot to be lost,' he said. 
'For example all the information in apps â€” that data is not "crawlable" 
by web crawlers. You can't search it.'

Mr Brin's criticism of Apple and Facebook was part of an alarming portrait he painted of the current internet landscape.

He also said the original open ethos 
championed by internet pioneers was under threat from plans by 
governments to monitor web use and attempts by entertainment companies 
to push through new laws allowing them to demand the closure of pirate 
websites.

Restrictive: Facebook and Apple both tightly control software on their platforms and access to their users

China has recently introduced 'real 
identity' rules in a bid to rein in microbloggers who have become 
increasingly critical of the regime, while Russian bloggers who helped 
foment protests against Vladimir Putin are facing increased pressure 
from the Kremlin.

Iran is reportedly planning to 
introduce a sealed 'national internet' from this summer, while the UK 
government has announced plans to monitor citizens' use of email and 
social networks.

Mr Brin said five years ago he did not
 believe China or any country could effectively restrict the Internet 
for long but he had been proven wrong.

'I thought there was no way to put the
 genie back in the bottle, but now it seems in certain areas the genie 
has been put back in the bottle,' Mr Brin said.

He cited China, Saudi Arabia and Iran as the greatest threats.

In the U.S., the entertainment 
industry, he said, is failing to understand that users will continue to 
download pirated content as long as it is easier to acquire and use than
 legitimately obtained material.

'I haven't tried it for many years but
 when you go on a pirate website, you choose what you like, it downloads
 to the device of your choice and it will just work - and then when you 
have to jump through all these hoops (to buy legitimate content), the 
walls created are disincentives for people to buy.'

Some will take Mr Brin's comments on 
Google rival Facebook, which has seen huge growth and now has more than 
800 million members globally, with a grain of salt. The social network 
has announced plans for a $100 billion IPO.

But his comments on increased 
interference by governments were echoed by Ricken Patel, co-founder of 
Avaaz, the 14-million strong activist network which has help train and 
equip activists in Syria.

Mr Patel said: 'Governments are 
realising the power of this medium to organise people and they are 
trying to clamp down across the world, not just in places like China and
 North Korea; we're seeing bills in the United States, in Italy, all 
across the world.'

Mr Brin also conceded that Google has 
itself lost the trust of many because its servers sit on American soil, 
and users' data are in reach of U.S. authorities.

He admitted the company was forced to 
hand over information to the U.S. government, and was also sometimes 
stopped from even telling users it had done so.
