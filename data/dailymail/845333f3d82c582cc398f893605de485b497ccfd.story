Argentina legend Diego Maradona turned 54 on Thursday - and his compatriot Dani Osvaldo  led the contingent of well-wishers.

Osvaldo, who is currently on loan at Italian side Inter Milan from Southampton, praised Maradona for the assistance he has provided during his career. 

In a message posted on Twitter, accompanied with a photo of the pair of when Maradona managed Argentina, Osvaldo declared: 'Do not judge what you do, or what you do with you life.

Maradona is an Argentina legend and is widely considered to be one of the world's greatest ever players

He almost single-handedly led Argentina to the World Cup in 1986 in Mexico and lifted the trophy proudly

'I thank you for what you did with mine... Happy Birthday Diego !!!' 

Widely considered to rank alongside Brazilian Pele in the list of all-time greats, Maradona almost single-handedly won the 1986 World Cup for Argentina and two Serie A titles for un-fancied Italian side Napoli.

In a glittering playing career, Maradona appeared in a second World Cup final in 1990 - when Argentina lost to West Germany - and scored 34 goals in 91 appearances for his nation between 1977 and 1994. 

He also won the Argentina Primera Division with both Argentinos Juniors and Boca Juniors, as well as the UEFA Cup with Napoli and a Copa del Rey with Barcelona.

With an incredible 312 goals in 588 club games, Maradona was so much more than an archetypal No 10.

Although considered one of the game's greatest ever players, Maradona was also never far from controversy throughout his career.

Most infamously, Maradona scored the 'Hand of God' goal to help knock England out of the 1986 World Cup in Mexico.

He was also sent home from the 1994 World Cup in the USA after failing a drugs test for ephedrine doping and he was addicted to cocaine for more than 20 years.

Maradona has failed to enjoy much success in his managerial career, however, struggling to make an impression with Mandiyu de Corrientes, Racing Club, Al Wasi or the Argentina national side, who he coached from November 2008 until their exit from the 2010 World Cup.
