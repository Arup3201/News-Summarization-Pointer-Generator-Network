Fiona Bruce has described how she lived in a ‘constant state of guilt’ as she struggled to juggle caring for her ailing parents with looking after her children.

The BBC newsreader’s mother Rosemary died of cancer in 2011 and her father John died just 18 months later.

But because she lives in London with her husband Nigel Sharrocks and their children Sam, 16, and Mia, 12, she was unable to spend as much time as she wanted with them at their home in Dalwood, Devon.

Miss Bruce, 50, said: ‘When both my parents were unwell I was in that situation that will be very familiar to many women. I had young children in one part of the country, and elderly unwell parents in another.

‘I was in a constant state of guilt. Was I there enough for my mother? Was I there enough for my children? I was trying to do my job at the same time and also I had a husband to think of. Trying to manage all that was difficult.

‘These two people had done everything for me, and would do anything for me. I could never really have done enough back.’

Miss Bruce – who also presents the Antiques Roadshow – revealed she also feels she is not always up to scratch as a parent. She told Woman & Home magazine: ‘What kind of mother am I? One that falls short – every day.

Speaking to Woman & Home, Ms Bruce said she prefers to spend time with her family than go out

‘And now that my kids are 12 and 16 I’m terminally uncool, which is faintly depressing. Even being on the telly is just not remotely cool to them.

‘The other day we did the Antiques Roadshow in London and I said to my husband, “do you want to come with the kids?” He said yes, but he rang at about 2pm and said “I can’t persuade the kids to come”.’

Miss Bruce said she prefers to spend time with her family than go out in the evening.

‘When I started presenting I’d get invited to red carpet events and I went to a few premieres. But pretty soon I thought, “Life’s too short”. If you work and you want to see your children, something’s got to give and for me, it’s my social life.’

She also spoke about her 20-year marriage with Mr Sharrocks, whom she met when she worked for an advertisement agency and he was the director.

‘I didn’t necessarily think he was The One immediately, but I did pretty soon after,’ she said.

‘By the time I turned 29 ... I was pretty sure we were heading towards marriage and so – it sounds so terrible when I tell this story – I said to him, “I’d like to be married by the time I’m 30 but I’d rather like you to ask me; I don’t want to ask you”.’

She added: ‘Don’t ask me the secret to a good long-term relationship – I have no idea! Honestly, I think it’s just luck.’
