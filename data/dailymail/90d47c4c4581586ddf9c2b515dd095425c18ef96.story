It's not the first thing most women think of when they go shopping for their smalls.

But for Karen Danczuk it was just another chance for a photo opportunity. 

After browsing aisles bursting with barely-there outfits, the 31-year-old picked out a revealing red and black corset - then whipped out her phone to share the moment with her online fans.

It took just a matter of hours for the councillor to post the fruits of her labour on Twitter - with a shameless plug for the lingerie store thrown in for good measure.

Photo opportunity: Karen Danczuk went shopping for lingerie today - but used the outing as another bit of shameless self-promotion

Strike a pose: The mother-of-two couldn't resist stopping to take a few photos of herself in her new outfit

Slinky: She spent the morning trying on the slinky corset at bespoke lingerie shop Chantilly, in Rochdale

Red: She later posted these selfies on her Twitter saying: 'I'm Labour through and through! I even bought the underwear to prove it' 

She posted: 'I'm Labour through and through! I even bought the underwear to prove it. KD #imtellingthetruth'.

She also linked her tweets twice to the shop, before also giving a shout out to her friend Nicollette North, who had watched on as Mrs Danczuk struck a number of pouting poses in her snug-fitting corset. 

It's hardly surprising that Mrs Danczuk chose to turn her latest shopping trip turned into yet another opportunity to add to her ever-expanding gallery of selfies.

The mother-of-two shot to fame last year after posting dozens of risque pictures - mostly showcasing her generous cleavage - to her 35,000 followers on Twitter.

Her pictures, which range from make-up free post gym scenarios to fully glammed-up nights out, have helped to propel her to the position of one of the most-famous women in public life.

But along the way she has drawn her share of brickbats, including among critics who accuse her of cheapening British politics.

On show: Some might ask whether the basque-like one-piece is becoming  for a  wife of one of Her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition

Snug fit: Mrs Danczuk asked Ms North, a mother-of-two, to make adjustments to her chosen corset

Adjusting to the new look: The councillor was out and about in Rotherham picking out her new attire

Be my Valentine? The images could cause a stir among hopefuls who are in the middle of furiously bidding to take the mother-of-two out on a date on Valentine's day this Saturday

Mrs Danczuk has previously been called 'the most embarrassing wife in Westminster' by former Conservative MP Louise Mensch - and these images will do nothing to help her cause.

Ms Mensch also branded Mrs Danczuk a 'trowel' over the amount of make-up she uses.

Some might also question whether the basque-like one-piece is becoming for a councillor and wife of a high-profile figure in Her Majesty’s Official Opposition.

But Mrs Danczuk appears to be undeterred by the criticism, as these images show. 

In another bid for self-promotion, Mrs Danczuk this week announced she would take 'one lucky winner' on a date this Saturday for Valentine's day, depending on who bid the most for the privilege.

Animal: The councillor also considered trying on an animal-print bra and brief combination

Winner: The councillor appeared to be most taken with the basque-like red and black corset 

Before the undressing: Mrs Danczuk and her friend spent the morning shopping in Rochdale 

Success: The MP's wife looked pleased as she left the shop carrying numerous bags of her new purchases

Her fans launched a furious bidding war, bringing the highest bid to £10,300.   

Today, Mrs Danczuk also today took a swipe at beleaguered Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman.

Ms Harman had already come under fire this week for the party's use of an all-female pink battle bus to engage with women voters. 

In the wake of the outcry, Mrs Danczuk told MailOnline how Miss Harman allegedly told her she was 'far too pretty to be interested in politics' and should join a girl band instead - something the deputy Labour leader denies. 

Costume change: Mrs Danczuk was later seen in jeans and a denim shirt unbuttoned to her bosoms as she went out for lunch in Rochdale following her lingerie shopping trip

Mrs Danczuk, who has represented the Kingsway ward on Rochdale council since 2011, announced last month that she was standing down as a councillor at the next election to pursue other opportunities.

She's already hired London-based agent Ginger Comms and is understood to be interested in pursuing TV work.

Mrs Danczuk also hit the headlines last year when she started selling signed pictures of herself posing in a bikini on eBay. But the £10 pictures were criticised by many buyers for being poor quality.
