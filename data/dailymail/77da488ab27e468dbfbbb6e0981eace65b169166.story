For years Muhammad has been racing up the chart of the country’s most popular baby names – and now he has been joined by his sisters Nur and Maryam.

The two girls’ names have been among the most popular of 2014, according to website BabyCentre. 

The data shows a surge in Arabic names in the UK this year, with Omar, Ali and Ibrahim all entering the boys’ top 100 for the first time.

For girls, Maryam has shot up 59 places to number 35, while Nur is a new entry in the girls’ top 100, jumping straight to number 29.

And Muhammad has risen an astonishing 27 places compared to last year to claim the number-one spot for boys.

Sophia was the top name for baby girls but the year’s biggest riser within the girls’ top 100 was Maryam, while the highest new entries were Nur, Emilia and Gracie.

For baby boys, Teddy was the biggest climber within the top 100. The highest new entry was Kian.

Sarah Redshaw, managing editor for BabyCentre, said: ‘With the increase of Arabic names, the top 100 shows the ever-increasing diversity of the UK today.’

The Royal relegation continued with George falling a further five places. The name slipped out of the top ten to number 13 shortly after the future king’s birth last year. Other royal names – such as Harry and William – also continued to fall in popularity this year.

Popular names from the 1970s seem to be making a comeback, with Emma, Sarah and Maria up 10, 32 and 12 places respectively

Miss Redshaw said: ‘Parents have also been influenced by celebrity name choices. The Beckhams and Simon Cowell have been big influences this year. Eric, the name Simon Cowell chose for his son, increased by 314 per cent.’

The names of David and Victoria Beckham’s offspring proved popular with parents. Harper is a new entry in the top 100 this year, while Romeo is up 67 per cent and Cruz is up 400 per cent.

Ariana entered the top 100 girls’ names for the first time, with singer Ariana Grande topping the charts this year. 

Game Of Thrones star Emilia Clarke inspired new entry Emilia at number 53 and Piper was up 267 per cent, thanks to TV series Orange Is The New Black. 

Breaking Bad also continued to influence parents, as Skyler, Jesse and Walter all increased in popularity.

But Miss Redshaw added: ‘Parents are wary of names associated with celebrities who exhibit bad behaviour, the controversial pop singer Miley Cyrus being a prime example.’ 

The name Miley has fallen, as have Amy and Nick, following the release of the mystery thriller book and movie Gone Girl.

Popular names from the 1970s seem to be making a comeback, with Emma, Sarah and Maria up 10, 32 and 12 places respectively. Angela, Joanne, Claire and Karen also all increased in popularity and John made it into the top 100.

This year’s more unusual names included Wren, London, Genisis, Blue, Hendrix, Braxton and Apollo.
