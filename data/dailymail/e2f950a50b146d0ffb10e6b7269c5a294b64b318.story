Just two weeks ago David Warner rushed to Phillip Hughes’ aid after he received the blow that so tragically cost the young Australian batsman his life.

So it seemed only fitting that it was Warner who provided the perfect tribute to Hughes with an emotionally charged century on day one of the rearranged first Test against India in Adelaide.

Warner was quick to dedicate the hundred to Hughes, saying: ‘This is probably going to be the best (century) of my career. That’s going to stick with me for the rest of my life.

Warner was clearly emotional after reaching his ton and was embraced by captain Michael Clarke 

‘I just had a gut feeling that my little mate was down the other end with me the whole time, from ball one.’ 

Before the match, players, management and match officials lined up in front of a large white 408 — Hughes’ Baggy Green number — painted on to the pristine outfield while a tribute played on the big screen.

Players wore black armbands, sported 408 on the chests of their playing shirts, and stood shoulder to shoulder to honour their mate. They also joined in 63 seconds of applause for the 25-year-old, who was 63 not out when struck by a bouncer from Sean Abbott two weeks ago. 

‘The initial part before the game started, my emotions took over and it was quite challenging,’ admitted Warner. ‘I came off to try to regroup a little bit, then I just played with my instincts.

‘The adrenaline was pumping and I slowly pulled it in a little bit. And I knew I had to, to survive.’

‘The hardest point of the day for me was when I was on 63,’ he said. ‘It was such a horrific incident and a rare incident that, in the back of my mind, even though a spinner was bowling, just being on that number, I felt it wasn’t right.

‘I just wanted to try and get past that. Michael (Clarke) asked me at the other end if I was OK, and I was. I had to step away for a couple of seconds, just to get my thoughts and my processes back.’

Warner duly found those processes and was already removing his helmet as he jogged the single that took him to three figures midway through the afternoon.

He kissed the badge on his helmet with feeling, raised his bat and helmet to the sky, looked long towards the heavens, and after two weeks of tension and grief he finally leapt into the air and was engulfed in a bear hug from Clarke.

As Warner buried his head in his captain’s chest, his shoulders seemed to shake just a little.

It was his 10th Test century, but the most meaningful and highly charged of them all. He eventually departed to yet another ovation when he tried to hit India’s leg-spinning debutant Karn Sharma into the Chappell stand and was caught at deep mid-wicket.

Warner readily admitted to having a tear in his eye as he put on 118 with Clarke on the first day
