Birmingham City winger Demarai Gray is keen to leave the club after a third bid from Bournemouth was rejected this week.

Gray, 18, has been monitored by Liverpool, Tottenham and Everton but Bournemouth have offered £2.75million plus another £1m in add-ons.

Gray, who made his debut aged 17 last season, has scored four goals and is a regular under new boss Gary Rowett but was on the bench for Saturday's cup tie with West Bromwich Albion.

There has been much speculation over his future, and Birmingham boss Gary Rowett has recommended that he only leave if a Champions League side come calling.

‘He’s a fantastic talent,’ said Rowett. ‘I think he’s best served being here until an opportunity comes his way that is befitting of his talent. 

'For me at the moment it’s only probably a top four team that can do that. That’s not being disrespectful to anyone else.’
