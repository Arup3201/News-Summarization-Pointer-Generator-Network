Olympic swimming champion Michael Phelps has temporarily retired from the sport to attend rehab after his second DUI charge. 

His eyes were 'red, bloodshot and his speech was mush mouth' when officers pulled the record-breaking multiple gold-medalist over in his white Land Rover at 1.40am on Tuesday.

According to a police statement of the incident, Phelps showed signs of intoxication, smelled of alcohol, and couldn't walk in a straight line.

Rehab: The record-breaking Olympic gold medalist will take time away from the pool to attend a program, he told his 1.6m Twitter followers after receiving his second DUI following an eight-hour casino session

Revealed: He tweeted followers this morning to explain why he is stepping aside after the arrest and charge

Today, the 29-year-old took to Twitter to apologize to his 1.6 million followers, and reveal that he is 'going to take some time away to attend a program'.

In a series of tweets, he wrote: 'The past few days have been extremely difficult.

'I recognize that this is not my first lapse in judgment, and I am extremely disappointed with myself.

'I’m going to take some time away to attend a program that will provide the help I need to better understand myself.

'Swimming is a major part of my life, but right now I need to focus my attention on me as an individual, and do the necessary work to learn from this experience and make better decisions in the future.'

It is the second time he has been arrested and charged with DUI. The first incident was in 2004. 

Reports claim Phelps had arrived at the Horseshoe Casino in Baltimore, Maryland, at 5pm on Monday afternoon.

In the early hours of Tuesday morning, he was pulled over.

He told Maryland police he had 'three or four drinks' and had just left the 'Horseshoe'., referring to the casino a few miles away.

 

 

 

 

When officers asked the 29-year-old to walk heel to toe in a straight line, he had 'difficulty with his balance.' Then when he was asked to stand on one leg, Phelps told police 'that's not happening'.

A later breathalyzer revealed Phelps had a blood alcohol level of .14, which is well over the state's  limit of .08. 

The website TMZ reported that the swimmer had been gambling at the Horseshoe Casino, arriving at around 5pm on Monday afternoon.

He sat in a VIP gambling room for several hours before leaving at about 1am, a casino source told the website. 

'Earlier this morning, I was arrested and charged with DUI, excessive speeding and crossing double lane lines,' Phelps tweeted on Tuesday afternoon. 

Phelps said that he understood the severity of his actions and took full responsibility for them

After winning 18 gold medals, two silver and two bronze medals at Olympics in Athens, Beijing and London, Phelps announced his retirement following the 2012 Olympics - but he then came out of retirement in 2014

'I understand the severity of my actions and take full responsibility. I know these words may not mean much right now but I am deeply sorry to everyone I have let down.'

He was also was charged with excessive speed and crossing double lane lines within the Fort McHenry Tunnel in his hometown of Baltimore. Police say he was driving 84 mph in a 45 mph zone.

It was the athlete's second DUI arrest. In 2004, at the age of 19, he was arrested for DUI and received 18 months probation. 

The then 19-year-old Phelps was arrested near Salisbury University  and charged with DUI, DWI, violation of a license restriction and failure to obey a stop sign.  

He was also made to pay a $250 fine and ordered to pay court costs of $55.

'I recognize the seriousness of this mistake,' Phelps told a judge in 2004 as 100 spectators looked on. 'I've learned from this mistake and will continue learning from this mistake for the rest of my life.' 

After winning 18 gold medals, two silver and two bronze medals at Olympics in Athens, Beijing and London, Phelps announced his retirement following the 2012 Olympics. 

Phelps apologized Tuesday afternoon - his second such apology. In 2004, at age 19, the swimmer was sentenced to 18 months probation after pleading guilty to driving drunk in Maryland's Eastern Shore

Phelps is the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time and has an astounding 22 medals from three Summer Games, including 18 gold. When he was last arrested for DUI, he announced 'I've learned from this mistake'

But in April 2014, at age 28 Phelps announced his plans to come out of retirement and return to professional competition at age 28, setting himself up to compete at next summer's world championships and at Rio in 2016.

Phelps said one of the reasons he returned to swimming was because it gave him a structured schedule, and he was bored in retirement.

'It's good to have some structure back in my life,' Phelps said in July. 'That's how I've always been. That's something I need.

'I was happy to get that year and a half where I did whatever I wanted, went wherever I wanted. I got that out of the way, and I'm happy to have this back.'

A later breathalyzer revealed Phelps had a blood alcohol level of .14, which is well over the state's limit of .08

A spokesman from USA Swimming said: 'The news regarding Michael Phelps and his actions are disappointing and unquestionably serious. We expect our athletes to conduct themselves responsibly in and out of the pool.'

In 2009, a British tabloid published a photo of Phelps using a marijuana pipe in South Carolina a few months earlier.

A sheriff said there was not enough evidence to charge Phelps with a crime, but he agreed to the suspension by USA Swimming. 

In the wake of the photo's release, Phelps said he 'used bad judgment and it's a mistake I won't make again.' 

In April 2014, at age 28 Phelps announced his plans to come out of retirement and return to professional competition at age 28, setting himself up to compete at next summer's world championships and at Rio in 2016
