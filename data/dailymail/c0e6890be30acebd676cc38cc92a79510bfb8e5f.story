George Osborne announced fuel duty had been frozen for the fifth year in a row

Fuel duty has been frozen for a fifth year in succession, allowing the Chancellor to boast that motorists have had ‘£10 off a tank with the Tories’.

Yesterday’s move means a 0.54p-per-litre duty rise planned for September 1 will not go ahead.

And the freezing of duty over the five years of the Coalition means the average driver spends £10 less per fill-up than if the controversial ‘fuel-price escalator’ had been implemented in full. 

Between 2011 and 2016, a typical motorist will have saved £675, the Treasury calculated.

The planned fuel duty rise by the RPI rate of inflation on September 2015 would have increased the current duty rate by 0.54p per litre – from the current 57.95p to 58.49p. 

For an average family car fill-up of 55 litres, this would have increased the cost by 30p.

Mr Osborne said he had cancelled the fuel duty rise because ‘I want to help families with the cost of filling up a car’. 

He added: ‘It’s a cost that bears heavily on small businesses too. It’s the longest duty freeze in over 20 years. It saves a family around £10 every time they fill up their car. That’s £10 off a tank with the Tories.’

Motoring groups welcomed the policy and urged any future government ‘not to step back on the escalator’. 

The RAC said the above-inflation fuel duty ‘escalator’ that operated between 1993 and 1999 ‘is the primary reason that we now pay nearly 70 per cent in tax on every litre of fuel we buy at the pumps’.

AA president Edmund King said: ‘The Coalition has done its “fuel duty” by shielding drivers from some of the impact of volatile fuel prices over the past four years by freezing fuel duty, and we welcome the further freeze and cancellation of the scheduled fuel duty rise for September 2015.

‘With petrol and diesel prices surging and falling by more than 35p a litre since 2010, the continued four-year fuel duty freeze allows the Coalition to dodge the fuel-protest bullet.’

Howard Cox, of the FairFuelUK campaign, welcomed the freeze but said the Chancellor should have gone further and cut duty. 

The move means a 0.54p-per-litre duty rise planned for September 1 will not go ahead, which for an average family car fill-up of 55 litres, would have increased the cost by 30p

He added: ‘We give Mr Osborne six out of ten for endeavour and will continue to campaign that duty should be frozen for the lifetime of the next Parliament.’

RAC Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: ‘With fuel duty revenue making up about 5 per cent of the Treasury’s tax income there was never going to be a huge giveaway as the Chancellor still desperately needs motorists’ money.’

He added: ‘But with the latest figures showing that almost a million of the poorest households see a quarter of what they spend go on buying and running a car the continued freeze is very welcome.’

Lynsey and Tom Fox will save £600 a year thanks to the fuel duty freeze.

The couple, who use their cars for commuting and taking six-year-old Megan and one-year-old Emily to school and nursery, drive a combined 1,500 miles a month.

Mr Fox, an IT manager, spends two hours a day making his 35-mile commute in rush hour. Filling up his 2.7-litre Mercedes every week costs him £280 a month. Mrs Fox, a maths teacher, spends another £70 a month on fuel for her VW Golf.

Yesterday George Osborne delayed an increase in fuel duty once again – meaning drivers are nearly £10 better off every time they fill up their car than they would have been had Labour’s ‘fuel-price escalator’ still been operating. This saves the family, pictured, about £50 a month.

Mr Fox said: ‘The extra money we save will be a nice little boost and we can spend more on the kids.’

Company cars take a clobbering

Basil Fawlty attacks his Austin 1100 in show

Starsky and Hutch's 1975 Ford Gran Torino

The classic car to which Basil Fawlty administered ‘a damned good thrashing’ is now exempt from road tax.

The character played by Monty Python actor John Cleese famously took a tree branch to a red Austin 1100 estate in frustration after it broke down on him in the 1970s comedy series Fawlty Towers.

But now it has reached an age where the Government no longer requires Vehicle Excise Duty to be paid.

Also newly exempt is the red 1975 Ford Gran Torino – with its trademark stripe – as used and rolled over by American TV cops Starsky & Hutch, played by actor and singer David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser in the popular 1970s crime- fighting series.

Paul Clark, senior tax manager at City accountants Deloitte, said: ‘An exemption from Vehicle Excise Duty for vehicles constructed 40 or more years ago was introduced in April 2014.

‘This exemption applies automatically on a rolling basis on 1 April each year.

‘So next month all cars made before 1 January 1976 will be exempt from the duty.’

He added: ‘This includes the 1975 Ford Gran Torino used in Starsky & Hutch and the Austin 1100 estate famously thrashed by Basil Fawlty in 1975’.

The majority of drivers with company cars will be hundreds of pounds worse off after the Chancellor moved to make the work perk ‘greener’.

The tax levied on the majority of company cars will be increased by three percentage points in 2019-20. The rate for environmentally-friendly vehicles will also rise – but at a ‘slower rate’.

City accountants said the changes are unfair on company car drivers locked into three or four-year deals who chose a cheaper vehicle ‘in good faith’ – only to have it re-classified months later as a gas-guzzler, and taxed accordingly.

The Government’s avowed aim of the changing tax rates for the ‘benefit in kind’ is to push company car drivers into greener vehicles – such as fully electric or hybrid cars, which carry a smaller tax burden.

This has fuelled a boom in low-tax ‘plug-in’ hybrid vehicles, which can be charged from the mains but also run on conventional fuel.

The tax on these so-called ‘ultra-low-emissions vehicles – or ULEVs – is still rising too. However, the Chancellor is at pains to point out that it is rising at a ‘slower’ rate because he is increasing the gap between the tax on the cleanest ‘green’ cars and the conventionally-fuelled alternatives.

George Osborne told MPs: ‘To encourage a new generation of low-emission vehicles we will increase their company car tax more slowly than previously planned.’

Ashley Hollinshead of accountants Deloitte stressed that because most company car drivers are signed up to three or four-year deals, they will be penalised for choices made well before the changes were introduced.

‘It’s effectively a retrospective tax on cars,’ he said.

‘Many employees with company cars will be locked into long term deals and will have no choice but to bear the ever-increasing cost of company car tax.’

‘Having previously introduced an annual two-percentage-point increase in the rate of company car benefit in kind to 2018/19, today George Osborne announced a further annual hike of three percentage points from 2019/20. This announcement will see the benefit in kind rate increase by nearly 50 per cent in the period to 2019/20.

‘For example, the benefit in kind rate on [a car emitting 100 grams of carbon per kilometre] will increase from 19 per cent next tax year to 28 per cent by 2019/20.‘

The changes mean a driver paying the 40p tax rate with a £28,000 1.6-litre Nissan Qashqai provided by their employer will be £1,008 worse off after five years, with a ‘benefit in kind’ tax bill of £3,360. Someone with a Golf GTI worth £28,000 will also see their tax increase by £1,008, to a total of £3,472.

An executive with a £38,000 BMW 5 Series will pay £1,368 more, taking their annual bill to £4,712, while anyone with an £81,000 three-litre Range Rover Sport as their company car will be nearly £2,600 worse off, with an annual bill of £11,998.

However, taxes on green cars mean the driver of a top-selling £28,304 Mitsubishi Outlander hybrid will also see their company car tax treble – rising by £1,245 to £1,811 a year. Tax on a £32,000 Volkswagen Golf GTE hybrid will rise by £1,408 to £2,028 by 2019-20.

Britain will become a world-leader in the development of driverless cars thanks to a £100million boost from the Chancellor. The figure will be matched by private-sector funding for a total pot of £200million.

The announcement was welcomed by Jaguar Land Rover, which hailed a policy that will ‘help create the smarter and more connected cars of the future’.

Two driverless car pilot schemes are already under way in Greenwich and Bristol.

Much of the technology – from automatic parking to radars that scan for pedestrians or cyclists and can slam on the brakes – already exist in the latest cars on the road. However, new research is aimed at making driverless cars both safe and socially acceptable.
