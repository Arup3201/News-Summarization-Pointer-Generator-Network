One in five lung transplant patients are given organs from 20-a-day smokers, research has  revealed.

Overall, almost a half of donated lungs come from someone who had smoked, according to a major  British study.

Using lung transplants from smokers is a way of boosting supply as there is a constant shortage of donor organs.

Discovery: Transplant patients who are given smokers' lungs (right) are just as likely to survive as those who receive organs from non-smokers (left), a study has revealed. Some patients even had higher survival rates

But for one in five patients, their donors had smoked a packet a day or more for at least 20 years.

Despite
 this, the researchers said patients' survival rate  was not harmed by 
receiving  a smoker's lung and the research should ease patients' fears 
about donors who had smoked.

The
 study showed that patients who received lungs from non-smokers actually
 had a slightly lower one-year survival rate. The research was carried 
out at Harefield Hospital in north-west London.

It
 analysed the difference in short and medium-term survival rates between
 patients given lungs from both smokers and non-smokers.

Since 2007, 237 lung transplants have been carried out and 90 per cent of them were double-lung transplants.

In
 total, 53 per cent were given lungs from non-smokers, while 29 per cent
 got lungs from donors who smoked for less than 20 years and 18 per cent
 were given the lungs of people who smoked 20 or more a day for at least
 20 years.

Concern: The use of smokers' lungs in transplants has sparked controversy - largely because of its perceived risk to patients (file picture) Discovery:

One-year and three-year survival rates were about the same for all three groups.

Non-smokers
 performed relatively poorly in the short term with 77.7 per cent of 
transplant patients surviving one year compared to 90.8 per cent with 
smokers' lungs. There was no significant difference in the overall 
effectiveness of the lungs, time spent in intensive care and in 
hospital.

AndrÃ© Simon, 
director of heart and lung transplantation and consultant cardiac 
surgeon at Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust, said: 'Donor lungs 
from even heavy smokers may provide a valuable avenue for increasing 
donor organ availability.'

He
 said the results showed that even donors with a heavy smoking history 
'may provide a much-needed lease on life to the critically ill patient 
whose chances of survival diminish with every day or week that passes by
 on the waiting list'.

He 
added: 'I believe that candidates significantly decrease their chances 
of survival if they choose to decline organs from smokers.'

Mr
 Simon said that although it may 'seem strange' that smokers' lungs 
perform just as well, he stressed that all organs are assessed before 
operations go ahead to ensure 'maximum quality and safety'.

UK Transplant Registry data shows that only 20 per cent of patients get transplants within six months.

The
 figure rises to 51 per cent after three years, but by that time nearly 
one in three patients has died waiting for a transplant.

Lung
 transplants are carried out for patients with a range of serious 
ailments including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic 
fibrosis.

The results of the study were reported in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery.

Patients given smokers' lungs are just as likely to survive, says new study

@highlight

237 lung transplants carried out at Harefield Hospital over six-year period

@highlight

Out of these, 47 per cent of patients received organs from heavy smokers

Meanwhile, 53 per cent were given lungs from non-smoking donors

However, survival rates were similar over one-year and three-year periods
