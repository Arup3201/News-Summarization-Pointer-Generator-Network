In an age where looking picture-perfect in an Instagram selfie is all the rage (thanks, Kim Kardashian), it comes as no surprise that women are brushing up on their beauty techniques.

However, rather than devouring beauty manuals or picking up tips from their mothers, two fifths of British women are now watching their way to better beauty skills.

A new survey has revealed that 41 per cent of women are watching beauty videos on YouTube or dedicated blogs - an industry that's garnered 700m hits a month worldwide, according to Pixability.

The research revealed that 61 per cent of those women regularly tune in to a beauty channel.

But what do we want to learn? How to create the perfect smokey eye is the most in-demand tutorial, followed by how to contour, highlight, do fancy dress make-up and pencil in our eyebrows.

And there's no denying the success of these bloggers - 38 per cent of women say they would buy products featured in the video, found the survey by Vouchercloud.com.

Michelle Phan is YouTube's leading star beauty vlogger with almost six million subscribers, more than 817 million video views since December 2013 and a reported net worth of £1.8 million.

Brit favourite Tanya Burr accumulates 10m views per month on her channel, has almost 2m subscribers and 500k Twitter followers.

So influential is Tanya that she has created a range of lipglosses and nail varnishes on sale in Superdrug. When the products went on sale exclusively on feelunique.com, they amassed the biggest waiting list the site has ever witnessed.

Speaking to MailOnline about her success, the 24-year-old said: 'I'm not entirely sure how my YouTube channel has become such a success, but I think it could be to do with my positive, friendly personality.

'I think the girls who watch my videos can relate to me as I'm not a traditional celebrity that seems unattainable, I'm still just a normal girl despite my large following.

'People say that when they watch my videos thy feel like I'm their friend and I love that. When I meet fans in the street I always feel like we could be best friends as we seem to always have lots in common which is lovely!

'I think the world of YouTube is amazing in that you can feel like you're hanging out with your girlfriends just by watching a video. It's also incredible in that, if it wasn't for my YouTube channel, I wouldn't have started my own makeup line.

'I couldn't have done it without the support of my fans. I spent a year and a half developing my lip gloss and nail polish range and was involved every step of the way. I started with these products as I feel like lip gloss and nail polish are fun items of beauty as you can wear so many different colours and play around lots.

'I love the colours I designed so much and I named them after all of my favourite things and places. For example, I got engaged in New York so I named one of the darker polishes New York Night and I love picnics so I named my favourite pretty pink gloss Picnic In The Park.'

Tanya's good friend Zoe Sugg, who goes 
by the online name of Zoella, has four million fans and Ruth Crilly of A
 Model Recommends, Lily Pebbles and Vivianna Does Makeup are also 
YouTube heavyweights.

Speaking about the YouTube video and beauty blogging phenomenon, journalist and beauty blogger Charlie Lankston said: 'The great thing about online beauty tutorials is that they are incredibly relatable and easy to follow at home.

'The people in the videos give easy step-by-step guides and give opinions and thoughts on products which appear to be completely genuine and honest.

'Seeing a product being used by a regular person - as opposed to a celebrity, or someone who has been photographed in the glossy pages of a magazine - gives a much more honest portrayal of how the product will really perform.

'I think it’s the honesty and the relatable nature of the videos that make them so appealing.'
