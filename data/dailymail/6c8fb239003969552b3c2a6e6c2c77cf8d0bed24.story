Like everyone else, Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella was at a loss to explain Brazil's collapse to lose 7-1 to Germany in the semi-finals of its home World Cup.

Sabella says the best explanation he has for the result was that 'football is illogical.'

Argentina's players watched the end of the game on television at Itaquerao Stadium in Sao Paulo on Tuesday night, delaying their training session for around 20 minutes and only appearing on the field after Brazil-Germany had finished in Belo Horizonte.

Sabella said the result was clearly 'not
 normal ... but in football you have to expect these things. It's 
football. It's the most illogical of sports.'

Argentina play the Netherlands in the second semi-final on Wednesday for the right to face Germany in the final.

'I can't confirm the starting line up just yet but Enzo Pérez is likely to replace Angel Di Maria on the left,' said the Albiceleste boss.

'I think this group of players have already won [by reaching last four]. Let's see if they win more. I'm proud.'

Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero has returned to fitness, although Sabella hinted that he would not start the game.

'He's a bit better. Let's see the circumstances of the game, if we need him.'

The 59-year-old was under no illusion at the task of hand against Holland, and reserved special praise for the Dutch manager Louis van Gaal.

'He is superb at coming up with game plans, proved it with career trajectory, very intelligent man,' he said.
