Piers Morgan last night criticised the U.S. gun lobby as ‘stupid and dangerous’ for suggesting that more firearms could reduce crime - and said he doesn’t care if his opinions make him unpopular.

His comments came as the White House defended freedom of speech and the press yesterday in a long-awaited response to an online petition to deport the 47-year-old over his views on gun control.

The CNN broadcaster got himself into a spectacularly bad-tempered confrontation on Monday when radio host Alex Jones challenged him to a boxing match following his calls for tougher gun laws.

Unimpressed: Piers Morgan last night criticised the U.S. gun lobby as 'stupid and dangerous' on Newsnight

'What happens here (in the US) affects me, my life and that of my family,’ he told BBC's Newsnight last night. ‘The guns issue here is now so dangerous and out of control that something has to give.

'The reaction of the gun lobby was to say more guns, less crime - arm everybody, (and) so this spiralling descent into gun madness continues. I do find it stupid and I do find it dangerous.

He said he was unphased by the ‘vitriol’ he was getting, and was trying to do ‘exactly the same’ as what President Barack Obama and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg were hoping to achieve.

‘It's very simple,’ he told Newsnight. ‘It's not about banning all their guns or attacking the Second Amendment. It's a very specific campaign to take these military-style assault weapons off the streets.’

Meanwhile, the White House Press 
Secretary wrote a response in a blog post attached to the petition to 
deport Mr Morgan, which had gathered more than 109,000 signatures by 
yesterday.

'Let’s not let arguments over the 
Constitution’s Second Amendment violate the spirit of its First,' Jay 
Carney said. ‘President Obama believes that the Second Amendment 
guarantees an individual right to bear arms.

‘However, the Constitution not only 
guarantees an individual right to bear arms, but also enshrines the 
freedom of speech and the freedom of the press - fundamental principles 
that are essential to our democracy.’

Mr Carney noted that the Sandy Hook massacre in 
Newtown, Connecticut, which left 20 children and six adults dead, had 
'sparked an intense, and at times emotional, national conversation’ 
about guns.

Mr Morgan celebrated news of the response
yesterday by saying on Twitter: ‘Breaking News: President Obama has 
officially decided I am not being deported.'

'The reaction of the gun lobby was to say more guns, less crime - arm everybody, (and) so this spiralling descent into gun madness continues. I do find it stupid and I do find it dangerous'

Mr Carney's response came after the 
petition on the White House website had gathered more than four times 
the requirement to warrant an official response from the administration.

The petition was started in response 
to an interview on Mr Morgan's show in which he called Larry Pratt of 
Gun Owners for America an 'idiot,' 'dangerous' and 'an unbelievably 
stupid man'.

In another debate, he shouted down 
economist John Lott, author of More Guns, Less Crime and branded him a 
liar for claiming gun crime trends in countries such as Britain 
supported his thesis.

The comments outraged gun owners across the U.S., who called for Mr Morgan to be deported.
