Michael Le Vell has admitted to taking cocaine in the weeks leading up to his sex abuse trial because he had reached the 'lowest ebb' of his life.

The Coronation Street actor, who was cleared of 12 charges including rape last year, said it was the ‘first time’ he had tried the drug and claimed it was a 'moment of weakness'.

Le Vell, 49, who is expected to return to the ITV show this month, said: ‘The first time I ever did cocaine was in the lead up to my trial.’

He told the Sunday Mirror: ‘…I had never felt so low – I knew I was innocent but everything was closing in on me and when someone offered them to me, I just agreed.’

The trial saw Le Vell open up about his alcohol consumption, with the actor admitting he contacted Alcoholics Anonymous after developing a habit where he drank up to nine pints every night.

He also admitted taking the drug after he was cleared, but said he stopped before returning to play Kevin Webster, the mechanic in the soap.

The actor, who tried the substance after a friend offered it, added: ‘I never thought I was the sort of bloke who would like cocaine but it was the moments of weakness when I was at the lowest ebb of my life.’

Le Vell faced a two-year nightmare from the time he was first accused of sex assaults in September 2011 until he was cleared last year.

After his first arrest prosecutors said they had dropped the case months later — but in February last year he was charged with a string of historic offences.

Last
 month, Le Vell reportedly had a showdown with worried family members 
after concerns his drinking session were affecting his work, but the actor denied his habit had led to drug-taking.

There were claims he would reach a local pub at around 12pm most days and stay there for the afternoon.

He had pledged to stop drinking, but friends and relatives said he was 'drinking more'.

The show's bosses gave him six months to recover from the trial, and it was alleged they had offered him help to quit the habit.

Le Vell, who has played mechanic Kevin on the hit soap since 1983, divorced his wife of 25 years Janette Beverley, who he has two children with, in 2011 after they became estranged.

She claimed alcohol turned her husband into a 
'ticking time bomb' and she would be subjected to his frequent outbursts leaving her emotionally exhausted.

Last year his ex-girlfriend, Chilean Blanca Fouche, 31, told how the star – who is separated from wife Janette, 48 - left her devastated by jilting her only days after he was cleared of 12 sex abuse charges, including rape.

He then grew close to long-term friend Emma Dodd, 28, and spent time with her over Christmas.

In January, he met 38-year-old Louise Gibbons after being introduced by friends at a pub and are now said to be in a relationship. 

On Valentines Day, the pair were pictured sharing a kiss after emerging from a pizza restaurant near his home in Hale, Cheshire.

After his arrest, scriptwriters explained 
away Le Vell's absence by saying his character was in Germany visiting 
his father, but he will return to the screen full time this spring.

On his return to the show, he will reportedly aim to rebuild his 
relationship with his on-screen ex-wife Sally, played by Sally Dynevor, who has 
meanwhile been dating Tim Metcalfe.

Stuart Blackburn, Coronation Street’s 
executive producer, told The Mirror: ‘I can’t wait to have Michael back –
 We were all watching the news for the end of the trial and there were 
cheers going up around the set when the result came through. It was just
 a sense of relief.

‘The new set is like a fresh new start for Michael, it’s all about the future now.’

A spokesman for ITV said: 'We will be meeting with Michael to discuss this situation.'

MailOnline have contacted Michael's representative for comment.
