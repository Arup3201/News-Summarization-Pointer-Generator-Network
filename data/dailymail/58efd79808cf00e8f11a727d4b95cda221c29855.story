School show and tells aren't, by their very nature, normally explosive affairs.

But one that took place at Suncoast Elementary School in Florida on Thursday carried a little extra excitement, because one of the pupils took a grenade to it.

Hernando County Sheriff's Office received a call from a teacher there informing them that an eight-year-old student was in possession of a hand grenade.

Shocking: An eight-year-old boy took a grenade to a show and tell at a school in Florida

Police and Hernando County fire and rescue officer were dispatched immediately, according to a police statement.

The caller advised that the student was currently with the Assistant Principal in the front office and that the Assistant Principal had taken the device away from the student, it said.

An subsequent investigation revealed that the hand grenade was hollowed out and had been brought in for a show and tell.

The statement added: 'While in class, he made some inappropriate statements.'

School staff will be speaking to the boy and his parents about the incident.
