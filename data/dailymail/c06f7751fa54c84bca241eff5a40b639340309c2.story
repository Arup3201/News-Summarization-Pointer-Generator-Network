It could be an example of life imitating art... or is it simply a dog marking its territory?

Perhaps, this little pup is saying exactly what he thinks of this latest piece of graffiti in New York by the mysterious British artist Banksy?

Either way, the mural has captured both the imagination of the public and dogs alike.

Dogged intuition: It looks like a regular fire hydrant so why shouldn't I lift my leg?

Advice: I wouldn't sit there if I were you!

Art? The graffiti by elusive British artist Banksy is part of his month-long Better Out Than In exhibit, in New York

Enticing: Seems as though dogs find Banksy's work more interesting close up than people do!

Banksy is staging a month-long ‘residency’ in New York City, but it seems that he's having a tough time of it.

His first two works were vandalized within hours of being created.

The reclusive artist announced he would be ‘attempting to host an entire show on the streets of New York’ throughout October in a project called Better Out Than In.

The first of Banksy's new pieces showed two boys wearing caps, with one reaching up to a can of spray paint and a sign which said 'Graffiti Is A Crime'

The first piece was found on the streets of the Lower East Side neighborhood in Manhattan.

It showed two boys wearing caps, with one reaching up to a can of spray paint and a sign which said ‘Graffiti Is A Crime.’

The work, called ‘The street is in play’, was accompanied by a telephone number which passersby could call for an audio guide to the painting.

The audio informed viewers somewhat prophetically: ‘Before you, you will see a spray art by the artist Banksy. Or maybe not. It's probably been painted over by now.’

But within hours of its whereabouts being announced, the work had been first whitewashed and then covered with other clearly inferior graffiti

But no sooner had word got out about the art work than it had been defaced, first with whitewash and then with other inferior graffiti which read: 'Sweaty palms made me lose the love of my life!'

A second piece of art was then uncovered in the Chelsea neighborhood underneath the High Line tourist attraction.

The white, spray-painted text read: ‘This is my New York accent’ in a traditional graffiti font, while underneath it was sprayed in a sans serif font: ‘…normally I write like this.’

But that too has already been vandalized with someone spraying their own tag over the top of it.   

Banksy, a pseudonym for the elusive artist who first emerged in the streets of Bristol, England and whose real identity is unknown, has become a coveted contemporary painter in the art world, known for his trademark spray-paint stencils on buildings that offer social commentary.

Unfortunately that too has already been vandalized with someone spraying their own tag over the top

Out of tune:  Not all art lovers are enthusiastic about the Banksy tour,  after the finding the artworks, New York street artists immediately alters the images by the British street artist

Showstopper: Banksy is touring the five boroughs. This latest piece was daubed on a wall in Bushwick, Queens

Opening night: Banksy has come to New York ¿ and New York doesn¿t seem very impressed

Latest offering: This weekend Banksy created some art in this truck

Hidden world: A woodland scene was created inside a truck

Pledge: The artist is going to unveil a new piece of art on each day of the month somewhere in the city, no matter the reaction of New Yorkers
