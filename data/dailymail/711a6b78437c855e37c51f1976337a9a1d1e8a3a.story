A NASA spacecraft
designed to one day fly astronauts to Mars rolled out of its
processing hangar at the Kennedy Space
Center in Florida on Thursday to be prepared for a debut test
flight in December.

An unmanned version of the gumdrop-shaped Orion capsule,
which has been under construction for three years, is due to
launch aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta 4 Heavy rocket on
December 4 from nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. 

'This is a pretty historic moment for us,' Scott Wilson,
NASA's Orion production operations manager, told reporters as
workers prepared to move the capsule to a fueling depot.

NASA's Orion spacecraft, preparing for its first flight, is rolled out on Thursday in Cape Canaveral, Florida

An unmanned version of the  Orion capsule,which has been under construction for three years, is due to launch aboard a rocket on December 4 from nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station

'This
marks the end of the assembly process for the spacecraft.'

United Launch Alliance is jointly owned by Lockheed Martin
Corp and Boeing Co.

In December, Orion will be flown to an altitude of about
3,600 miles from Earth, 14 times farther away than
the International Space Station.

The capsule will then careen back toward the planet,
slamming into the atmosphere at 20,000 mph. 

At that
speed, Orion's thermal protection system should heat up to about
4,000 degrees Fahrenheit, proving the
shield can protect astronauts returning from the moon and other
deep-space destinations.

Orion is part of NASA's follow-up program to the now-retired
space shuttles that will allow astronauts to travel beyond the
International Space Station, which flies about 260 miles above Earth.

The SLS is larger than the Saturn rockets than launched man to the Moon. It will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today. Russia's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled. However construction of the first stage of Russia's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway

A test flight with crew aboard is set for 2021. NASA intends
to use the rocket and Orion to fly astronauts to an asteroid
that has been robotically relocated into a high orbit around the
moon. 

Orion is being prepared for its first launch later this year, an uncrewed flight that will take it 3,600 miles above Earth, in a 4.5 hour mission to test the systems critical for future human missions to deep space.

After two orbits, Orion will reenter Earth’s atmosphere at almost 20,000 miles per hour before its parachute system deploys to slow the spacecraft for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. 

Eventually, the U.S. space agency wants to fly a
four-member crew to Mars.

NASA has been out of the human space launch business since
the shuttle program ended in 2011. The agency currently buys rides for space station crew
members aboard Russian Soyuz capsules.

A heated three-way
competition to build a U.S.-based commercial space taxi is also
under way. 

The contenders are privately owned Space Exploration
Technologies, also known as SpaceX, privately owned Sierra
Nevada Corp and Boeing.

Work on the Orion deep-space capsule, built by Lockheed
Martin, began more than a decade ago under NASA's defunct
Constellation moon program. NASA has already spent about $9
billion developing Orion.

Orion is part of NASA's follow-up program to the now-retiredspace shuttles that will allow astronauts to travel beyond theInternational Space Station, which flies about 260 miles above Earth

In June, the test version of Orion touched down safely in the Arizona desert after being pulled out of a C-17 aircraft, 35,000 feet above the U.S. Army's Yuma Proving Ground.

It was the first time some parachutes in the system had been tested at such a high altitude.

Engineers also put additional stresses on the parachutes by allowing the test version of Orion to free fall for 10 seconds, which increased the vehicle's speed and aerodynamic pressure. 

After Orion's free fall, its forward bay cover parachutes deployed, pulling away the spacecraft's forward bay cover, which is critical to the rest of the system performing as needed.

The parachutes that slow Orion to a safe landing speed are located under the cover, so the cover must be jettisoned before they can be unfurled.  

The test also marked the last time the entire parachute sequence will be tested before Orion launches into space in December on its first space flight test, EFT-1.

During the flight, an uncrewed Orion will travel 3,600 miles into space, farther than any spacecraft built to carry humans has been in more than 40 years.
