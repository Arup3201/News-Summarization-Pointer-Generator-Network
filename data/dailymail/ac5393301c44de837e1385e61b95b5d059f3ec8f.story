The Queen is to become the first monarch to attend Cabinet since Queen Victoria

The Queen is to attend a Cabinet meeting in Downing Street, it was announced today.

Ministers have been told to be on best behaviour when the monarch takes a seat at the famous Cabinet table tomorrow morning.

One minister today admitted the politicians will be 'minding their Ps and Qs'.

She will become the first head of state to attend Cabinet since Queen Victoria.

The visit is the latest stage in her Diamond Jubilee celebrations, which last week took in a trip to the Bank of England where she made headlines by criticising 'lax' financial regulators.

She will have 'observer status' for half an hour at the weekly meeting of the senior members of the government, but any contribution she makes will be closely analysed.

Since the coalition was formed the Cabinet room has occasionally been the scene of explosive rows, often between the Tories and Lib Dems.

But both parties will want to present a united front for their special visitor.

The Queen is expected to sit along 
side Prime Minister David Cameron, meaning either Foreign Secretary 
William Hague or Permanent Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood will have to 
give up their seat.

Downing Street said Cabinet ministers have had a whip round to buy the Queen a present to mark 60 years on the throne. Prince Philip will not join her on the visit.

Downing Street announced the news on Twitter, with the message: 'The Queen will visit Downing St tomorrow.

'She will be presented with a gift to mark her Diamond Jubilee and attend Cabinet as an observer.'

It is the second time the Queen will have been to Downing Street to mark her Jubilee year.

In July she attended a lunch with Mr Cameron, and former Prime Ministers Sir John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.

Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: 'It is a great honour that she is attending Cabinet in her Diamond Jubilee year. It has been a very exciting year for everybody.

Ministers will be excited but minding their Ps and Qs even more than normal.'

Announcing the plan this morning, Downing Street said it was the first time since Queen Victoria that a reining monarch has attended Cabinet.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman told a regular briefing of journalists: 'I think she will sit round the table and I think she will sit alongside the Prime Minister.

'It has been long planned as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. I think it will be well attended.'

As head of state the Queen does not get involved in party politics, and merely signs off legislation brought forward by 'Her Majesty's Government'.

However, last week she came close to expressing a personal view on government policy when she expressed dismay at the role of the regulators in the 2008 financial crash.

In a highly controversial foray into government policy, the monarch appeared to criticise the regime created by the Labour governmentÂ  when Gordon Brown was Chancellor.

Touring the Bank of England, the Queen claimed some in the City had become 'lax' and were not focussed on the potential problems which triggered the credit crunch when banks were over-run by debt.

Meeting staff at the Bank, she was head saying: 'People had got a bit...lax, had they?'

She was told: 'A lot was going on under the surface that perhaps regulators weren't so focussed on.'

But the Queen replied: 'The Financial Services - what do they call themselves, the regulators - Authority, which was really quite new...it didn't have any teeth.'

Both the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority played down the significance of the remarks, which will be seen as a major rebuke from the head of state for failing to prevent the biggest economic crash since the Second World War.

The Bank of England said it was 'very grateful to Her Majesty for her visit today and for taking such an interest in its work'. And the FSA admitted it made mistakes.
