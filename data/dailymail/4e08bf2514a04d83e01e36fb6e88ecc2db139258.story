The high school football player accused of raping 14-year-old Daisy Coleman pleaded guilty to child endangerment today but was not charged with any sexual offenses after the teen and her family accepted his apology.

Matthew Barnett, 19, was given a two-year 
suspended sentence in Maryville, Missouri after entering a plea bargain that required him merely to apologize and pay $1,800 towards Coleman's 
future counseling.

Coleman, who has tried to commit suicide three times since the alleged attack in 2012, said she believed Barnett's apology was 'genuine', Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said.

'Today I am grateful… I am ready to 
move forward,' Coleman, now 16, said in a statement. 'To all of those who 
supported me, I promise what happened on January 8 of 2012 will not 
define me forever.'

Her mother Melinda, who has been 
incredibly outspoken since the January 2012 incident, added in her own 
statement: 'I hope that today’s resolution of this criminal case brings 
some closure for my family, especially my children, and for the 
community.'

It is an 
astonishing turn-around from just days ago when Melinda launched a 
scathing attack on the investigation following her daughter’s suicide 
attempt.

She added to CBS News that, although she was disappointed a sexual assault charge was not filed against Barnett, she was appreciative of the work Prosecutor Baker did.

'I think she had a really tough task and I think she did the very best she could do with it,' she said. 'Considering all the evidence that had been lost, destroyed, tampered with or returned… There wasn’t a lot she could do.'

The child endangerment 
charge, which was only brought to the court on Thursday morning, stems 
from leaving Daisy outside her house in the snow following the alleged 
attack.

Barnett was not charged with a felony after prosecutors said on Thursday that there was insufficient evidence to support sex assault charges.

It
 was also revealed all charges against 19-year-old Barnett’s co-accused 
Jordan Zech have been dropped, effectively bringing an end to the saga.

Thursday's
 court proceedings and the Coleman’s acceptance of the sentence will 
come as a surprise to the millions of people around the world who have 
followed the explosive story.

Speaking out: Defense attorney J.R. Hobbs talks to the press after defendant Matthew Barnett pleaded guilty to child endangerment at the Nodaway County Courthouse in Marysville, Missouri on Thursday

Limited charges: Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker talks to the press after he pleaded guilty. There was not enough evidence to charge him with sexual assault, prosecutors said

Coleman had claimed that Barnett raped her at a January 2012 house party, when 
he was a Maryville High School senior and she was a freshman. Barnett 
says the sex was consensual.

The case received national
 attention after fellow students relentlessly bullied the alleged victim
 for reporting the attack - eventually forcing her family to flee the 
small town. The family home then mysteriously 
burned down.

But Prosecutor Baker was insistent that Thursday's outcome is the right outcome.

She
 said there was insufficient evidence for any kind of sexual assault 
felony charge, which is what Daisy and Melinda were pushing for from the
 outset.

Baker
 said: 'Legally we could not get that over the bar. I could not file 
that charge.' She added if the evidence had existed to allow her to file
 a felony sex charge, 'I would have done it'.

'It
 is not the job of the prosecutor to seek convictions. It is the job of 
the prosecutor to seek justice. I believe this is the right outcome, 
given the evidence available in the case. This is justice.'

The
 plea, Barnett’s attorney JR Hobbs said outside of the Nodaway County 
courthouse, 'accurately reflects the conduct for which he should be held
 accountable. Mr. Barnett truly regrets the actions to which he pleads 
guilty.'

The
 announcement of the lesser charge of endangerment comes only days after
 Ms Coleman made a third attempt on her life - this one resulting in 
possible brain damage.

She is currently being held in the psych ward of a Kansas City Hospital.

Hours
 before she attempted to take her life, she wrote a tweet on Sunday 
hinting at the emotional toll the ordeal has taken on her.

'Don’t give up they say,' she wrote. 'You’re so strong they say. But none of you even know me.'

And,
 in yet another bizarre twist, mutilated rabbits were stuffed inside a 
car belonging to another girl who was sexually assaulted that night. The
 sick act came just hours after Coleman attempted suicide.

The
 charges stemmed from an incident on January 8, 2012 when Barnett and 
some other boys picked up Daisy and Paige Parkhurst, then-13-years-old, 
from Daisy's house and took them to the home of one of the boys. The two
 girls sneaked out of Ms Coleman's home to attend the party.

Daisy claimed that when she got to the party she was given a clear liquid that she drank before being taken into a bedroom and raped while a second boy recorded the act on his cellphone.

Daisy said she blacked out and doesn't
 remember much after arriving at the boy's home. Melinda Coleman has 
said she believes her daughter was given a date-rape drug.

Mr Barnett admitted the two had sex and that he was aware Ms Coleman had been drinking, but has steadfastly insisted the sex was consensual.

Jordan Zech, 17, was charged with sexual exploitation of a minor for filming the encounter.

Ms
 Parkhurst was taken into a different room by a 15-year-old boy who 
forced her to have sex, which he has admitted to doing. His case was 
handled in the juvenile system and is not public record.

Melinda Coleman said she 
awoke around 5 a.m. to a clawing sound at her front door and found her 
daughter shivering in sub-freezing temperatures. She said she was giving
 Daisy a bath to warm her up when she noticed signs that she had been 
assaulted.

Daisy was
 then subjected to relentless bullying online and in school. It became 
so bad she has tried committing suicide multiple times.

The family then fled Maryville for their hometown of New Albany. Their Maryville house soon mysteriously burned to the ground. Investigators have yet to determine a cause for the fire.

The case shook the small college town of Maryville, which was deluged with negative reactions after The Kansas City Star published a seven-month investigation into claims made by the Colemans.

Many people condemned the town on social media - and continue to do so - for seemingly abandoning sexual assault victims.

The outcry led to a protest on Maryville's courthouse square in which a few hundred people showed up to show their support for Daisy and lambaste what they labeled as a 'rape culture' that allowed the girl's assailant to go unpunished.
