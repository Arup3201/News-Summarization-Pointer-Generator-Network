Andy Prowting has been given months to live after being diagnosed with malignant melanoma 

A man has been given just months to live after learning a mole he developed while on holiday was in fact a rare form of cancer that has spread through his inner organs. 

Andy Prowting had returned from a trip to Turkey when he noticed the large, brown mole on his back. 

After having it removed, the 24-year-old from Havant, Hampshire, learned the rare form of cancer had spread to his bones and liver - leaving him with months to live. 

Now he is frantically raising money for a potentially life-saving treatment in the US that is not yet available in the UK.

'I was in Turkey last July and even though I was applying sunscreen every hour, I got burnt,' he said. 

'In January I felt something on my back and got my mum to check.

'There was a mole and we kept checking it and noticed it was growing a lot and I went to see my doctor.'

After being referred to a dermatology centre, the security guard was diagnosed with malignant melanoma. 

Surgeons removed the mass as well as lymph nodes under his right arm and tissue from his back at Queen Alexandra Hospital in April as part of an aggressive course of treatment.

Three months later, Mr Prowting was referred to Southampton to take part in a chemotherapy clinical trial. 

It was then doctors revealed the cancer had spread throughout his body and he may only have nine months to live. 

'Without treatment I have got about nine months to live, which is scary and upsetting,' he said.

The security guard (pictured with his girlfriend Katie Ward) is now raising money for a trip to a clinic in Houston, Texas, where doctors believe they may be able to treat his condition 

'I can feel tired and sick and I get achy as well.'

He is now raising £60,000 for a trip to the Burzynski Clinic in Houston, Texas, which offers treatment to stop the disease from growing.

'After seeing my medical notes the clinic has accepted me, it's just a matter of raising the money.'

'We've raised about 11,000 pounds in three weeks and everyone has been so supportive.

'I've got to have hope, this has all been so devastating for me.'

Skin cancer is among the most common forms of the disease in the world, affecting hundreds of thousands of people in the UK every year. 

There are different types of skin cancer - non-melanoma and melanoma diseases. 

Melanoma - which Mr Prowting has been afflicted by - is a serious and fast spreading disease. 

Beginning in the skin, it spreads through the body and contaminates inner organs. 

The most common symptom of this form of cancer is a mole, most frequently appearing on the back, arms and legs. 

These types of moles are often itchy and bleeding and may larger than the norm. 

NHS Choices has devised an ABCDE checklist to distinguish between melanoma moles and ordinary blemishes: 

Non-melanoma cancers refer to a group of cancers which slowly develop in the upper layers of the skin.  

While not all forms are preventable, it is possible to lower the chance of non-melanoma cancers in a number of ways.

Applying sun screen and dressing sensibly while in the sun is advisable as is avoiding sunbeds or sunlamps which emit UV rays. 

Exposure to UV rays is thought to be one of the biggest triggers for skin cancer, though family history, fair complexion and having lots of moles or freckles also increase a person's chance of developing it. 

Applying sun screen frequently and wearing sensible clothing in the sun is recommended to avoid skin cancer
