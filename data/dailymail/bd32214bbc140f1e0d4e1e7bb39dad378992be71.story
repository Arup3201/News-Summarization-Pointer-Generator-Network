A baby gorilla born via emergency C-section nearly two weeks ago has met her mother for the first time.

After about 10 days of around-the-clock care, keepers at San Diego Safari Park introduced the adorable newborn to 18-year-old Imani and her gorilla family on Friday.

Video shows a keeper holding the unnamed girl, wrapped in a fluffy white blanket, up to Imani, who sat behind a protective barrier.

It was the first time the baby had 
visual interaction with other gorillas or even left the veterinary 
hospital since undergoing major surgery
 for a collapsed lung.

Moving: San Diego Zoo Safari Park's baby gorilla, born via emergency C-section on March 12, was introduced to her mother, Imani, on Friday

Integration: Friday's introduction was the first step to reintegrate Imani's little one with the Safari Park gorilla troop

The little gorilla weighed just 4lbs 6oz when she was born with breathing problems on March 12.

Her mother had been in labor for 12 hours  - a normal stretch for human moms-to-be, but rare for gorillas.

'With gorillas, thatâ€™s very unusual,' zoo spokeswoman Christina Simmons told ABCNews.com. 'Four hours is long for them.'

As her mother recovered from the prolonged labor, the infant was moved to a neonatal intensive care unit, where oxygen and fluids kept her strong through treatment for a collapsed lung and pneumonia.

Now, after being cared for and monitored in a special bedroom-like area, keepers have started the process of integrating the little gorilla with her troop.

Friday's special meeting was the first time the baby - who is now breathing on her own and slurping down milk formula - had seen other gorillas.

Keepers want the gorilla troop to familiarize 
themselves with the zoo's new addition through a protective barrier.

'Veterinary
 staff felt confident in the baby's health to release her from the 
hospital,' senior keeper Matt Gelvin told Peoplepets.com. 'Everyone is very excited to 
see the baby â€“ very curious.'

The baby is the 17th gorilla born at the Safari Park, but Imani's first.

In good hands: Veterinarians said the C-section, although rare, was the right decision for the baby's health

Looked after: The operation was performed by the San Diego Zoo Global team, a veterinary surgeon and a neonatal specialist from UC San Diego Medical Center

Emergency surgery: When the newborn struggled to breathe, an X-ray revealed she had a collapsed lung
