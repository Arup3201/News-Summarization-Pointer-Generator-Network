A mother whose daughter was killed in a car crash exactly one year ago has had her child's ashes mixed with ink and tattooed onto her wrist.

Maria Williams, 41, from Tredegar in South Wales, says the inking means she can carry her daughter Sophie with her 'always'.

Sophie, who was just 20 years old, was pregnant with her second child when she was killed in a  collision on Valentine's Day last year.

Although doctors tried to save mother and child, both died at the scene, while her boyfriend Ben Morgan, who was driving at the time, was left badly hurt.

Mrs Williams, who was also pregnant at the time of the accident, has gone on to have another daughter of her own and had hoped to raise the child, named Sasha, alongside her granddaughter.

'I believe everything has happened for a reason,' she says. 'We miss Sophie dreadfully but she was taken to a better place.

'For us, Valentine’s Day means broken hearts. We will remember her always.'

Mrs William's sons Shane, 18, and Skyle, 15, have also had tattoos made using Sophie's ashes etched onto their bodies, in both cases a drama mask.

According to Mrs Williams, the tattoos were chosen because Sophie loved acting, while her own three roses represent the 20-year-old's favourite flower. 

Despite having the tattoo, Mrs Williams says she will never get over her daughter's death but admits the birth of new baby Sasha has brought some happiness back into her life. 

'I’ve had my baby now, a little girl called Sasha,' she says. 'Every day I think about the little niece she should be growing up with.'

Sophie, who was already mother to a two-year-old daughter named Mia, was coming home after a romantic supper when Mr Morgan lost control of the car.

Mr Morgan is now raising the little girl alone. 

'Nothing will ever be the same,' adds Mrs Williams. 'Sophie was more than just my daughter, she was my best friend.'
