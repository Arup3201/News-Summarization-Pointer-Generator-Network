Eidur Gudjohnsen sauntered towards goal, intelligently cutting a ball with the outside of his right foot and there was Emile Heskey, expectant at the back post, to slide in. No, this wasn’t a re-run of Premier League Years circa 2004, but the modern day Championship.

It was with that move that this derby changed. Bolton, sporting a front two with a combined age of 72, somehow dragged themselves ahead and won a game they had no right to.

Heskey, on for his debut at half-time, changed the complexion, showing just why Neil Lennon took the plunge and signed him on a short-term contract pre-Christmas. He equalised before Darren Pratley plundered home the winner in a derby befitting its Boxing Day billing.

And while this is another vital three points in Bolton’s quest to arrest the gap with the top six - they are also eight unbeaten - it was the combination of the two wily old strikers which really caught the imagination.

Heskey’s last goal in English football came for Aston Villa in August 2011 - ironically against the same opposition, who actually had him on trial just over a month ago - and it took him just 14 minutes on his return to find the net.

‘I’ve got two old age pensioners playing for me,’ Lennon grinned. ‘A lot of people were laughing behind our backs bringing these guys in.

‘Only Gudjohnsen could see that pass and Heskey was awesome. I wasn’t expecting that from him if I’m honest. Heskey was a huge influence on the way we played.’

Even so, this was a game Gary Bowyer left disgusted not to take anything from. Blackburn were the better side for lengthy spells and will rue the amount of missed opportunities once Josh King gave them a lead. Rudy Gestede hit a post, so too did Jordan Rhodes, while the club’s top scorer somehow conspired to flash wide after giving Andy Lonergan the eyes one-on-one.

Ben Marshall drew a stunning one-handed save from the Bolton goalkeeper as they failed to capitalise on their dominance.

It had looked so comfortable for Rovers. Rhodes went up for a high ball, got a shout from King and ducked underneath, allowing his strike partner to race clear. Still 40 yards from goal, he had plenty to do but rounded the goalkeeper and slotted in the opener amid cries for offside.

After the break, however, they struggled to get to grips with the combination of Heskey and Gudjohnsen, the former equalising before Pratley smashed past Jason Steele. ‘It should’ve been done at half-time - it’s as simple as that,’ Bowyer said. ‘Lonergan’s man of the match, isn’t he? You look at the chances we had.’

Blackburn will feel aggrieved not to have equalised, but this rain-sodden afternoon belonged to a man who had long been forgotten. Heskey even had time to play hero and clear off the line.
