The Football Association will tomorrow make their announcement on the action they will take over Mark Clattenburg race-row allegations — Sportsmail understands they are unlikely to charge the referee.

FA officials have spent a significant sum on legal advice and taken their time in order to come to the right decision.

The announcement will come 18 days after Clattenburg was accused of calling Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel a ‘monkey’.

The police yesterday shelved their race abuse investigation into referee Mark Clattenburg after receiving no complaint from Chelsea.

The Metropolitan Police have confirmed they are no longer investigating a complaint, made by the Society of Black Lawyers, regarding Clattenburg’s conduct.

The FA inquiry finished on Friday and they have since been receiving legal opinion on a draft document.

It has been delayed due to the vast amount of paperwork involved.

Chelsea submitted 1,250 pages of evidence delivered by bike courier to the FA’s three-man compliance unit when John Terry was accused of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand — a charge he was later found guilty of by the FA.

They have a full-time QC amongst their employees and it is believed the club will have been equally as thorough with this case.

If, as expected, Clattenburg, 37, is cleared by the FA it will leave Chelsea's reputation in tatters after their captain John Terry was banned for four matches and 
fined £220,000 after being found guilty of racially abusing QPR's Anton 
Ferdinand by a Football Association independent regulatory commission.

Hours after reporting Clattenburg to the FA, a spectator in the Chelsea end was pictured directing a 'monkey' gesture at Manchester United striker Danny Welbeck during a Capital One Cup tie.

Gavin Kirkham, 28, is on police bail pending a further investigation following his arrest on suspicion of a racially aggravated Section 4A Public Order Act offence.

Chelsea have banned him from Stamford Bridge until the police investigation is concluded and he faces a life-ban if found guilty.

Mr Kirkham is due back in police custody on November 29 where he will either be charged and will go to court, re-bailed pending further investigation or released without charge.

Clattenburg has not officiated in a match since the incident. But some refereeing experts have suggested he will be handed a last-minute match in the lower leagues this weekend in an under-the-radar bid to assimilate the Durham official back into officiating.

Chelsea chairman: Bruce Buck

The incident occurred in Chelsea’s 3-2 Barclays Premier League loss to Manchester United on October 28. Chelsea came from two goals behind to level at 2-2 before having Branislav Ivanovic and Fernando Torres sent off.

Afterwards Chelsea accused Clattenburg of the racial slur on Mikel – who angrily stormed into his dressing room and confronted him after the match – and of calling Juan Mata a ‘Spanish t***’.

The club later dropped the accusation against Mata but pressed ahead and reported the comment about Mikel to the FA.

Yesterday, in an interview with the Evening Standard, Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck stood by the club's allegation levelled at Clattenburg.

'We
were guided by obligations that are imposed by the Football Association
and also as an employer. FA rule E14 basically says a participant shall
immediately report to the association any incident or matter which may 
be considered to be a misconduct.

'Misconduct
is a defined term under the FA regulations and includes such racial 
behaviour. We also had to consider the Equality Act 2010, which imposes 
an obligation on an employer to take certain actions if an employee is 
subject to discrimination by third parties.

'Suppose
we had tried to sweep this under the rug and said to the various 
players, "Look, it's not a big deal and the press are going to be all 
over us, maybe you want to reconsider". If that had leaked out, we 
would've really been crucified.'
