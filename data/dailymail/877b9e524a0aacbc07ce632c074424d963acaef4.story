'He was the heart of our home': Joni Brace, 33, fell to his death while having a late-night cigarette

A smoker fell to his death when he fell out of his bedroom window while havinga late-night cigarette.

Engineer Joni Brace, 33, had opened the window to sit on the ledge for his last cigaretteof the day.

But he slipped - and fell 20ft to his death, hitting his head on a wooden tableon the patio below.

Keen football fan Joni was found dead by his appalled mother the next morning.

Qualified engineer Joni was working 12-hour shifts to save up for a trip to seehis brother in Australia at Christmas.

He had worked a 12-hour shift at International Rectifier in Newport before returning to his home in Harrow Close, Caerleon, and telling his mother he was going straight up to bed.

His devastated mother Carol Brace, 61, said: 'He kicked his shoes off, threw his coat down, hada shower and said: "See you in the morning."

'Joni always had a lie-in on a Saturday but when he wasn’t up for the Manchester United game I thought it was strange - he lived and breathedfootball.

'When I went into his bedroom the window was open and I shut it, then I wentoutside into the garden and there he was.

'We’re still in disbelief over his death, it’s just such a tragic accident.

'He was generous, the heart of our 
home.  He was such a darling boy.  He was funny and had the most amazing
giggle.  He used to tell us he loved us every single day.'

She said her son 'lived and breathed football', had 'fantastic mates', and enjoyed golf and a drink with his friends.

'We just keep thinking he's upstairs': Joni's friends and family have set up a Facebook memorial page

Mrs Brace added: 'His shoes are still there where he kicked them off.  We just keep thinking he's upstairs.

'His death is just a tragic accident. It’ll take us years to come to terms with it. We never will but we’ll soldier on. We’ve got amazing family and friends.”

Hundreds of friends have posted tributes to him on a Facebook tribute page setup for Joni, of Caerleon, near Newport, South Wales.

Gwent Police are investigating the tragedy and an inquest will be opened laterthis week.
