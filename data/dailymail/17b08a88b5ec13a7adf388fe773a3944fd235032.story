Chill-seeking: Ben Stookesberry, 34, was the first person to kayak down a glacier

This is the moment a daredevil kayaker d-ices with death - as he becomes the world's first to plummet over a glacier's waterfall.

Ben Stookesberry, 34, plunged into the icy waters beneath the 65ft freezing falls of the Braswell Glacier.

Alongside fellow pro paddlers Pedro Oliva, 29, and Chris Korbulic, 26, the trio performed a series of death-defying jumps in Svalbard, Arctic Circle, last month.

Ben, from California, USA, said: 'We 
wanted to push the boundaries of our sport.

'It is something that hadn't been done and it has been a whole year in the making, planning everything.

'Running waterfalls in a river is 
very dangerous, so doing it in one of the remotest locations on earth 
could have been potentially lethal.'

The
trio came face-to-face with polar bears during their 12-day boat and 
kayak adventure through Svalbard, one of the world's most desolate 
landscapes.

Brace yourself: The team had to wear special drysuits to prevent hypothermia kicking in

The group - who were being filmed as part of a Brazilian TV series called Kaiak on Canal Off - spent four-and-a-half days travelling to the glacier's waterfall alone.

They wore dry suits specially designed to keep them from hypothermia while swimming in the waters.

But
with just one kayak between them, Chris opted to spectacularly backflip
into the water, while Pedro hurled himself feet first into the sea 
below.

Chris, from Oregon, USA, added: 'From
the edge all I could see was the expanse of the glacier - and some sea 
birds flying around me.

'It was one of the most amazing sights and feelings of the whole trip.

'I've made a lot of jumps and backflips, but never in such an extreme place.

'I was just telling myself not to slip on the ice and make sure to rotate all the way and not get lost in the crazy view on the way around and down.'

Brazilian Pedro, a former waterfall 
kayaking world-record holder from Brazil, continued: 'Our first attempt 
was not successful, and we were about to give up the jump with the 
kayak.

'We could only carry one kayak up there because it was so dangerous so I volunteered to jump.

The group spent twelve days in Svalbard where they came face-to-face with polar bears

The northern landscape is one of the most desolate on the planet

'There began moments of pure adrenaline as the sun set and shined off the ice. It was a privileged view.'

It had taken two painstaking days to find the safest spot to perform their chilling feats - all while carrying rifles to protect them from rogue polar bears.

Ben added: 'They are beautiful animals but they are very dangerous and volatile when hungry.

'We were hundreds and hundreds of miles north of the nearest town so we were carrying rifles to protect us against the bears.

'There were many dangers, not least 
the polar bears. You had to be careful of treading on cracks in the ice 
hidden by fresh snowfall and the face of the glacier was constantly 
moving.

'It was probably the most exposed situation I have ever been in.'

Chris said: 'It is one of the most difficult situations I had been in with the trip.

A step for mankind: Ben became the first person ever to kayak over a glacial waterfall

'I've never known a time when doing a jump, or backflip where standing on the edge was as dangerous as the actual landing.

'There were polar bears, crevasses, sudden storms, and freezing water, then once at the edge, the danger of the glacier calving while standing on the edge amplified the feeling of difficulty and consequence.'

During their 12 day round trip from Longyearbyrn in Svalbard, temperatures plummeted as low as minus 19 Celsius with the wind chill - cold enough to catch hypothermia in a matter of minutes.

But the excitement of the jump kept them going.

Chris added: 'It had been a long day to get to the edge, and I was the last to jump, so I was getting pretty cold, but the anticipation kept me plenty warm.'
