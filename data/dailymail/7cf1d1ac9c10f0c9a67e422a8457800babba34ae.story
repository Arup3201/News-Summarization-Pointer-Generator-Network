Outlaw: Kelly Lynn Miller, 36, was arrested by Thai police Tuesday after spending six years on the run to avoid being deported back to the US, where she was sentenced in 2007 to prison time  

An Alabama woman who fled the US after being charged in a fatal DUI crash and spent the past six years on the run was captured in Thailand this week.

The Tourist Police in the Thai resort town of Phuket City announced during a press conference Wednesday that Kelly Lynn Miller, 36, will be deported back to the US, where she had been sentenced to prison in the 2004 death of 57-year-old Florida truck driver Donald Goodwin.

According to investigators, Ms Miller has been living as a fugitive in Thailand ever since she escaped from Alabama in 2009.

Miller, who gave birth to a baby boy while on the run, threw out her passport and spent the past six years island-hopping to avoid detection, said police officials.

Miller's luck ran out Tuesday when police acting on a tip from the US Embassy caught up with her on the remote island of Koh Lanta, off the coast of Krabi province, reported the Thai publication Phuketwan.

Tourist Police officials said the 36-year-old woman had been moving between Koh Lanta, Samui and Hang islands without a current visa.

Investigators said Miller delivered her son two months ago in a small clinic on the island of Samui, and his birth was not registered.

Thai authorities believe Miss Miller's relatives in the US had been wiring money to her to help her make ends meet.

About a month ago, police in the US somehow learned of Miller's whereabouts and have been keeping tabs on her movements.

On Tuesday at around 9am Phuket time, an officer with the Tourist Police approached Miller in the parking lot of a Koh Lanta guesthouse and asked her to show her passport.

When she was unable to produce the document, the officer placed her under arrest.

During today's press conference with police, the 36-year-old American fugitive appeared indifferent and unconcerned by the proceedings, casually propping her chin with her hand.

At one point, she was reportedly seen applying lipstick as police recounted the circumstances of her arrest in Thai.

Police said Kelly Lynn Miller met the father of her baby, an American national living in Thailand legally, but the man said she never told him that she was an outlaw.

Her two-month-old son is expected to be deported alongside her to the US in the near future.

In 2004, Kelly Lynn Miller, then 26 years old, was driving drunk on Interstate 459 in Hoover, Alabama, when she struck and killed 57-year-old Donald Goodwin, according to Al.com.

The Florida truck driver pulled over in the emergency lane and was checking the tires on his tractor-trailer when police said Miller sideswept the vehicle and then careened into Goodwin.

Miller was arrested after the crash on DUI charges but was released the next day after posting $1,000 bond.

In 2006, a Jefferson County jury indicted Miller on a charge of vehicular homicide. She was re-arrested but again freed from jail after posting $10,000 bond.

Miller was expected to go on trial in January 2007 but pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years in prison.

Before Miller was set to report to prison, she took off and was officially declared a fugitive in 2010.

Following her arrest in Thailand Tuesday, the 36-year-old woman allegedly admitted to police that she flew into Bangkok in January 2009 and then spent the next six years traveling on an expired visa.
