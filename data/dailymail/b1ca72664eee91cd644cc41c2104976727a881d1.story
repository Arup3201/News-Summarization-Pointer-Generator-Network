Tormented: Patricia Bell was found dead in a pond after her dementia meant she could no longer read

A tormented 85-year-old retired archivist and historian with a ‘great mind’ was found dead in a pond after her dementia meant she could no longer enjoy her beloved books, an inquest was told today.

Former county archivist Patricia Bell, of Bedford, Bedfordshire, was found floating face down in the water after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2011 which saw her reading skills diminish.

The keen historian was found dead in a pond at Bedford Park last September after drinking gin and becoming ‘distressed’, after making two previous suicide attempts, Bedford Coroner's Court heard.

The pensioner’s walking stick, a 
handbag and an opened bottle of gin were later found by the side of a 
park bench by a gardener close to her body, still floating in the water,
the inquest was told.

A 
post mortem revealed she had died of immersion - and the shock of 
falling in water may have caused cardiac arrest. At the inquest, the 
coroner refused to rule out the possibility she had fallen.

Despite
her previous suicide bids deputy coroner Bob Amos recorded an open 
verdict, saying: ‘Patricia, from what I gather, was a woman of good 
intellect and was struggling with ill health.

‘It is fair to say she was not coping with her Alzheimer's and feared being put into a home.

‘Although
I’ve read the letters from friends and heard the words from her carer 
about her attempts to take her own life, I cannot say beyond all 
responsible doubt that this is a verdict of suicide.

‘Because
of the drink, the ill health and Patricia's age are all factors. I 
don't think I can say that she definitely wanted to or made a decision 
to take her own life.’

Ms Bell was the 
county archivist of Bedfordshire between 1968 and 1986 and also held the
position of editor of the Bedfordshire Historical Record Society's 
publications between 1977 and 1991.

But
she had been suffering from breast cancer at the time of her death and 
had been struggling to come to terms with her failing health, the 
inquest was told.

She had been told to improve her 
cleanliness during a nurse’s visit and had begun worrying she may end up
in a home. Ahead of her death, she had lunch with her carer before 
heading into town.

Ms Bell was then captured on CCTV at 
3.30pm popping into a shop and again at 5pm but was not seen again after
this time. At 7.44am the next day, police were called to the park by a 
gardener, who had discovered a body floating in the pond.

Ms Bell was found just under twice the legal limit for driving of alcohol in her blood stream.

Pathologist
Dr Kay Adu-Poku said the cause of death was immersion which had caused 
an enlarging of the heart and the secondary cause was breast cancer.

But evidence read aloud in court suggested Ms Bell had been upset at the time of her death.

'I had a good friendship of 16 years with Patricia and she had become very unhappy. She was distressed as she wasn't able to read literature anymore - which was her passion'

Heather Bailey, Patricia Bell's friend

In
written evidence read out to the coroners court, Ms Bell's close friend
of 16 years, Heather Bailey, explained how the pensioner had become 
unhappy.

The letter read: ‘I had a good friendship of 16 years with Patricia and she had become very unhappy.

‘She was distressed as she wasn't able to read literature anymore - which was her passion. She had a good intellect and because of the Alzheimer's her sight was failing making it difficult to read.

‘She was the county archivist and a great mind. Patricia was also in a great deal of pain with the breast cancer.’

In an official obituary, Ms Bell's close 
friend Richard Wildman, said: ‘Her greatest fear was that she would 
emulate some of her cousins and live to an extreme and uncomfortable old
age.

‘Diagnosed with early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, she found herself unable to continue reading and gave away her books.’

She had an external degree from London University and had trained as an archivist in the Hampshire Record Office before moving to Bedford in 1956 as assistant to her distant cousin Joyce Godber.

Ms Bell edited two collections of early Tudor wills in 1966 and 1997 and contributed to other volumes, including a festschrift compilation for Ms Godber in 1978.

She was described as a loyal member of the Church of England and a former elected lay member of the General Synod. Her family did not wish to speak after the inquest.

Ms Bell is survived by her brother Brian, her sister Zilpha and four nieces.
