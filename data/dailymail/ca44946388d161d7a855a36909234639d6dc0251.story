The Mail on Sunday is today offering a £5,000 reward to help catch a man suspected of savagely attacking a father of four in his own home.

Oskar Pawlowichz, 29, is wanted in connection with an attempted burglary in which four masked men forced their way into Paul Kohler’s £2 million home in Wimbledon, South-West London.

Three other men have already been arrested over the incident which left the Cambridge–educated law lecturer fearing he would lose his sight.

Recovering at home as he awaits reconstructive eye surgery, Mr Kohler, 55, said:  ‘I want this man to be caught for what he did to my family – not just the physical blows but also the psychological trauma.

‘I hope, through this reward, someone who has remained quiet will think it’s worth the risk of coming forward.’

Detectives believe that Pawlowichz, who is 6ft tall, stocky, bow-legged and walks with a limp, is being harboured by someone in the Polish community in Britain. 

The £5,000 reward will be paid for information leading to his arrest.

Police said last night one line of investigation related to CellarDoor, the bar Mr Kohler co-owns near Covent Garden. It is possible the men who broke into the house were looking for takings.

Detective Inspector Dan O’Sullivan, who is leading the Scotland Yard investigation, said: ‘By putting out a reward I think someone could give him up.’

Anyone with information should call the  police incident room on 020 8649 3019 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
