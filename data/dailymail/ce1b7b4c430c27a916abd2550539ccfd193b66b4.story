Claims: Labour MP Simon Danczuk - who says the BBC has shown extraordinary bias in its coverage of the affair

The Labour MP who lifted the lid on Cyril Smith’s crimes has accused the BBC of 'extraordinary bias' in is coverage of the affair.

Simon Danczuk, whose biography of the 29-stone sex abuser is being serialised by The Daily Mail, is sending a formal complaint to the Director General, Tony Hall.

BBC News completely ignored Saturday’s front-page revelations about the book, only to change tack 24 hours later, when Smith’s family announced that they were 'saddened and concerned' by its publication.

In a hostile report, the BBC website declared that the family believed Danczuk to be 'motivated by political and financial gain.'

The Labour MP says he was 'flabbergasted' by the report, particularly since he wasn’t contacted for comment by the BBC prior to publication.

‘Here we have a book showing that Cyril Smith was a paedophile for more than forty years, and the BBC’s first reaction is not to ask why it was covered up, or to look at the horrors his victims went through and the lives he ruined.

‘Instead, they ask whether the bloke who wrote it is biased. I’m flabbergasted. The BBC have a track record of being blasé about child abuse. Look at how Jimmy Savile was swept under the carpet. Have they not learned anything from history?’

Mr Danczuk said he believed the organisation’s coverage of the affair is being coloured by a pro-liberal bias.

‘I believe the fact that this story is being led by the Daily Mail has driven the BBC to take a particular view. It’s hugely disappointing.

'If this book had been serialised by the Guardian, it would be leading their news bulletins.’

A BBC spokesman said: '[Cyril Smith] is an ongoing story that we have covered extensively in the past, and will continue to report on as and when there are developments that warrant it.'
