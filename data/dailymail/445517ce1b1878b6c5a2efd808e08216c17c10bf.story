Angela Douglas was convicted of murder at Plymouth Crown Court in April and given a life sentence with a minimum tariff of 12 years

A mother-of-two who cooked Sunday lunch for her family before going upstairs to murder her own mother has had her jail sentence halved on appeal.

Angela Douglas, 49, had downed two-and-half bottles of wine when she suffocated Anne Matthews, 73, with a pillow saying she wanted to end her pain. 

Douglas was convicted of murder at Plymouth Crown Court in April and given a life sentence with a minimum tariff of 12 years. 

But today, three senior judges at the Court of Appeal in London said the tariff was 'excessive' and reduced it to seven years.  

The decision means Douglas will be free to apply for parole in 2020, taking into account time served. 

Lord Justice McCombe said: 'She did have a genuine belief that what she was doing was an act of mercy and there had been no premeditation.'

Plymouth Crown Court heard how Douglas and her partner Shane had visited her parents on April 28 last year. 

She cooked the family Sunday lunch, drank wine and took her mother a cup of tea and biscuits in bed.

Her father then went upstairs and found her kneeling and crying over her unconscious mother.

An ambulance was called but when paramedics entered her bedroom Douglas told them: 'I don’t want you to do anything, she’s been through enough.'

The medics also noted that Douglas was drunk and slurring her words. Further tests found she was heavily intoxicated.

Douglas, a former nursery nurse, claimed she was acting ‘out of love’ after watching her elderly mother struggle with emphysema.

But the pensioner, a former smoker who weighed less than five stone, was not terminally ill.  

Douglas confessed to killing her mother but denied murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. She claimed a stress-related illness meant she was not in control of her own actions. 

In April this year, a jury at Plymouth Crown Court found her guilty of murder in less than an hour.

Today, her barrister, Paul Dunkels QC, said the 12-year term she had initially been ordered to serve was too long, given the mitigating features of the case.

He said: 'She was distressed by the deterioration in her mother's health and had told others that she hated watching her mother die.

'Her character was such that she found dealing with stress and anxiety difficult and that affected her thinking about her mother's condition.

'The killing was not planned or premeditated, with the idea only coming to her as she lay on the bed next to her mother on that evening, the appellant then being in an emotional and intoxicated state.'
