The family of a Mexican-American singer whose plane crashed on Sunday is refusing to give up hope that she will be found alive.

Jenni Rivera's brother said last night the family has not accepted that she died when her private jet went down in the mountains outside Monterrey, Mexico - despite her half-melted river's license being found at the crash site.

'In our eyes, we still have faith that our sister will be OK,' Rivera's brother Juan told reporters outside the family house near Long Beach, California, on Monday.

'We thank God for the life that he has 
given my sister,' said Juan Rivera, also a singer. 'For all the triumphs
and successes she has had, and we expect that there will be more in the
future.'

Shocking: Jenni Rivera's mangled driving license was found near the wreckage of the plane crash that killed the singer and reality star on Sunday

No bodies have been recovered from the wreckage of the Learjet LJ25 that disappeared from radar 10 minutes after taking off from Monterrey early Sunday, where Rivera had performed a concert.

'There is nothing recognizable, neither material nor human in the wreckage,' transportation ad communication minister Gerardo Ruiz Esparza told the Televisa network.

It was revealed on Monday that seven years ago, a fuel system malfunction on the 1969 Learjet 25 caused one of the plane's wings to weigh more than the other and crash while it was attempting to take off from an Amarillo, Texas, airstrip.

The 43-year-old plane- which was the same age as the famed singer on board- was approved for flight after transportation safety officials checked out the fuel systems following the 2005 incident.

The cause of Sunday's crash remains unknown, but investigators with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board are assisting Mexican authorities.

The wreckage was spread 300 feet from the point of impact outside Monterrey, Mexico.

Rivera
and the six other people aboard the plane - two pilots and four members
of her entourage -  are presumed dead, though authorities have found no
bodies amid the debris.

River was revered for her soulful voice and her openness about her personal struggles.

'I want to thank you all for your 
support, and please remember her with all your heart,' Rivera's father 
Pedro said outside his Lakewood, California, home.

The U.S.-registered Learjet 25 went missing early Sunday after taking off from the city of Monterrey.

Widespread: Searchers used helicopters as they looked for pieces of the wreckage and attempted to recover bodies from the mountainous area where the plane went down

Discovery: It appears that one of the pilots was inexperienced, based on the temporary airman's certificate found at the crash site

Mourning: Fans left candles at a makeshift memorial outside the home of Jenni Rivera in California

Jorge Domene, spokesman for Nuevo 
Leon's government, said the plane left Monterrey about 3.30am after a 
concert there and aviation authorities lost contact with the craft about
10 minutes later.

It had been scheduled to arrive in Toluca, outside Mexico City, about an hour later.

Jose Antonio Gonzalez, the
mayor of the town of Iturbide in Nuevo Leon state, said earlier the plane had 
been located in the municipality of Los Tejocotes.

Domene says a search for the plane was launched early Sunday, with helicopters from the local civilian protection agency flying over the state. 

Seven people including the star's publicist, 
Arturo Rivera, lawyer, makeup artist, Jacob Yebale, and the flight crew were believed to be aboard, the ministry of transportation and 
communication said in a statement.

'I am a woman like any other and ugly things happen to me like any other women. The number of times I have fallen down is the number of times I have gotten up.'

She has five children from prior relationships.

Three days ago, it was reported that Rivera had agreed to shoot a pilot for a new ABC sitcom called Jenni.
