This is the smirking drug-crazed yob jailed for three-and-a-half-years today after he beat up and robbed a care worker in the street.

Monica Cismaru, 39, pleaded for onlookers to intervene as career criminal David Hindson, 33, grabbed her by the neck and demanded her 
belongings in an attack he thought was 'funny'.

The terrified woman gave desperate cries for help but passers-by ignored the crime, as Hindson even felt her neck to see if she was wearing a chain.

Miss Cismaru, 39, who is originally from Romania, is so upset nobody came to help her she is too frightened to go anywhere on her own.

Details of the horrific 'walk on by' incident emerged as Hindson, from Accrington, Lancashire, was jailed for three and a half years after admitting robbery and theft.

Today Miss Cismaru was still too upset to talk about her ordeal last November.

Burnley Crown Court was told the incident occurred while Miss Cismaru was walking through Accrington town centre at 8.10pm.

Hindson who was leaning against a wall noticed the victim walk past him whilst she was chatting on her mobile phone.

Moments later she then felt somebody grab her around the neck. Miss Sarah Statham prosecuting said Miss Cismaru struggled to break free and tried to keep hold of her phone but Hindson pulled it from her grip.

He then kept his arm around her neck and then went for her shoulder bag, which contained important personal documents. Miss Cismaru continued to struggle, but the defendant took her bag and then made another grab for her neck, shouting : 'The chain, the chain.'

She wasn't wearing a necklace and Hindson eventually ran off after a further struggle when there was nothing else to steal from the victim.

The prosecutor said : 'She was absolutely terrified. She was crying, went back home and immediately telephoned the police.

'She was upset that nobody came to help her. Until the incident, she had always felt safe, but she is now frightened to go out anywhere on her own.'

Hindson later confessed to robbing Miss Cismaru to a 16-year-old girl and appeared to find it 'funny'.

He also asked how much he could get from selling the phones.

Miss Cismaru's missing iPhone was later found under a mattress at the home of Hindson's girlfriend.

None of the other property was recovered.

It emerged after the mugging Hindson had sneaked into a house in the early hours of the next day and help himself to another mobile phone and handbag from the bedside cabinet of a mother as she lay asleep in bed.

The court heard Hindson had been abusing drugs since he was 11 and had a cocktail of drink and cannabis in the moments before the mugging.

He had 32 previous offences on his record, which included seven charges of possessing an offensive weapon, three of affray and four of assault.

He was once described in court as 'dangerously out of control,' after threatening another woman with a knife and a shovel in separate attacks.

In mitigation defence counsel Mr Daniel King said : 'At the time, he was feeling depressed and anxious.

'He had no permanent accommodation and drink and drugs - related problems. He had been drinking and taking cannabis. He really can't explain or excuse his behaviour in any way further than that.'
