Going back to work after a relaxing weekend, you could be forgiven for drifting off at the end of a tiring Monday for a quick cat nap.

And this kitten appears to agree as it contemplates whether to fall asleep or stay awake.

The animal, named Oscar, was captured repeatedly dozing off on its owner's lap at a house in Scotland.

Time for a cat nap? Oscar has clearly had enough of what has clearly been a very long day as he nuzzles up in his owner's lap

It could be seen closing its eyes and drifting off to sleep, before waking up with a start just seconds later.

The adorable moment was filmed and posted on YouTube by one of Oscar's owners.

Footage shows the ginger-coloured kitten narrowing its eyes, before closing them completely.

It then slowly tips its head backwards until it is nearly resting on the arm of its owner, who appears to be sending a message on his phone.

Should I stay or should I go? Oscar begins to narrow his eyes as his owner fails to pay attention to him, instead sending a message on his phone

I'll just rest my eyes for a minute: Oscar seems to have decided that there's nothing wrong with 40 winks, catching up on his beauty sleep

Purr-fect: He slowly tips his head backwards until resting on the leg of his owner

The cat's whiskers: Seemingly undecided as to whether to fall asleep - he abruptly wakes up, with his eyes shooting open. Not for long though

But seemingly undecided as to whether to fall asleep or not, the kitten then abruptly wakes up - its eyes shooting open and its arm flailing around.

However, it is not long before the animal starts to drift off once more.

Since being posted on YouTube, the video has received dozens of comments from animal lovers across the world.

One user, Joyce Danahue, wrote: 'Awww - cute overload  warning! It's definitely time for bed for this little guy, but he just doesn't want to miss anything.'

Meanwhile, Nicole Baresi said: 'This is adorable. I must immediately go and buy a kitten.'

And another user, using the name 'jp tab', wrote: 'What a sweetheart, keeps waking up to see what was missed... animals are so wonderful.'
