Bulgarian children took to the streets in colourful and embroidered masks today as the country celebrated the arrival of spring with centuries-old traditions.

Blagoveshtenie, or 'Annunciation', is one of the most important Christian holidays and the Balkan country spares no effort to keep its traditions alive.

According to the Holy Script, on 25 March, nine months before the birth of Jesus Christ, the Archangel Gabriel came to the the Virgin Mary and told her that she would become mother to the Son of God.

In Bulgaria the celebration is known Blagoveshtenie, meaning 'Sweet News,' and it is also known as Annunciation or Lady Day.

Bulgarians also celebrate the traditional holiday Blagovets, which has its roots in the national folklore. It had several meanings developed into a complex system of omens and beliefs.

Children wore animal fur masks and danced as they scared away the 'evil spirits' during the Christian Orthodox holiday in the town of Varna, east of the capital Sofia.

The celebration dates back to the seventh century. In the traditional conception this day is associated with the arrival of the migratory birds and with the final springtime awakening of nature.

The masks and bells are said to warn off evil spirits that take the form of snakes and lizards

Adults and children come out in force, ensuring they are both well fed and have money in their pockets during the celebrations. This is said to bring good luck for the year.

Trees are planted, and beehives are opened so that the bees can be free to make sweet honey for the locals.

Girls can get their ears pierced on this day, as common belief is that all poison and infection is rendered useless on Blagoveshtenie.

The evil spirits are said to be in the form of snakes and lizards who emerge on this day. Rituals take place, fires are burnt and the houses are cleaned to banish these negatives.
