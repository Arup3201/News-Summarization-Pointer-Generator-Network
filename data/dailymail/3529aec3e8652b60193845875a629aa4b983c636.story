A cyclist has sparked controversy after he pinched a woman's bottom while on the podium after a race.

Peter Sagan was widely criticised after being photographed grinning with his had on hostess Maja Leye's backside after coming second in the Tour of Flanders on Sunday.

The 23-year-old apologised and insisted he meant it as a 'joke' - and many of his fellow Slovaks have come out in support of him.

Controversy: Peter Sagan, left, pinched Maja Leye's bottom as she was kissing Fabian Cancellara on the podium after the Tour of Flanders in Oudenaarde, Belgium on Sunday

Support: Slovaks have been pictured pinching each others' behinds in homage to the controversial act

Polemic: The pictures are intended to signify that there was nothing wrong with Mr Sagan's actions

Dozens of web users have posted comic pictures of themselves pinching others' behinds in a homage to Mr Sagan's divisive actions.

The controversy started after the race in Oudenaarde in Belgium, in which Mr Sagan, 23, was runner-up to Fabian Cancellara.

The winner was pictured on the podium being kissed on the cheek by Ms Leye and another hostess.

But the Slovakian cyclist drew attention to himself by reaching out and grabbing the bottom of the blonde woman.

Elaborate: This comic picture posted online clearly took a lot of logistical effort to set up

Parody: Some Slovakian web users involved props such as cuddly toys to craft their supportive jokes

Backlash: They clearly though that Mr Sagan had done nothing wrong and was being unfairly criticised

Many commentators accused Mr Sagan of sexism - Jane Aubrey, editor of cyclingnews.com, tweeted: 'In the workplace, it's called harassment.'

The online storm prompted the cyclist to issue an apology for his actions, saying he did not want to 'disrespect women' and adding: 'Just a joke, sorry if someone was disturbed about it.'

He later posted a video on his website in which he said: 'I sincerely apologise to Maja for what I did on the podium yesterday after the race because it was wrong of me. I never should have done it.

'I am so sorry and I hope that Maja and anyone else I have offended knows how sorry I am and accept my apology. I promise to act more respectfully in the future.'

Raunchy: Some of the submissions involved a certain amount of explicit content

However, many Slovaks apparently thought Mr Sagan had nothing to apologise for, with many making jokes which indicated they thought the incident was overblown.

'The hostess kissing the winner - a complete stranger - is a shocking case of harassment in the workplace,' journalist Tomas Teicher wrote on his blog.

Nearly 5,000 people have joined a Facebook group urging members to pinch strangers' bottom in solidarity with the cyclist.

They have posted lighthearted photographs of themselves pretending to 'harass' either friends or inanimate objects such as statues and even cuddly toys.
