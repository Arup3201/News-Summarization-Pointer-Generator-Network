When Mitch Hunter walked down the street, children hid behind their mothers because they were scared of what they saw.

On becoming a father himself, he decided to have a face transplant, because he didn’t want his own son to be afraid of him.

Mr
Hunter, a former soldier whose face was destroyed saving a woman’s 
life, can now smile again, feel the breeze on his face and warmth of his
wife’s kiss.

New life: Mitch Hunter sits with his son Clayton and girlfriend Katarina following the amazing procedure to rebuilt his face and help him lead a more normal life

And he can walk down the street without children shouting, staring and hiding in fear.

Mr Hunter, 30, of Indianapolis, is one of the first people in the world to be given a whole new face.

His face was destroyed when, as a young solider, he heroically saved the life of a woman 10 years ago.

When
the car he was in smashed into a 10,000 volt electrical pylon, he 
pushed the woman, who was also in the crash, out of harm’s way, and 
thousands of volts of electricity surged through his body, severely 
burning his face.

He
then went through at least 20 corrective operations, with skin taken 
from his thighs and elsewhere in his body used to patch him up, but the 
results were far from satisfactory.

The disfigurement scared children and fascinated adults, who stared at him when he ventured outside.

He
had no normal sensation in his face and had lost the bulk of his lips 
and so his girlfriend Katarina had never kissed him on the lips.

The 30-year-old, pictured left as a soldier before the accident which destroyed his face, was left with horrific injuries and needing skin grafts following a car crash in which he saved a woman's life.

When he and Katarina had a son, he decided it was finally time to get a new face.

He said: ‘I’ve had kids hide and run behind their moms because they were so scared when they saw me.

‘That was hard to cope with because my friends started having kids, then my brother had a kid.

‘Then I had Clayton and I didn’t want kids to be afraid of me any more.’

On
Sunday, BBC2 documentary Frontline Medicine will tell the story of the 
14 hour operation, in which he was given an entire new face, including 
eyelids, lips, muscles of facial animation and the nerves that power 
them and provide sensation.

Painstaking
micro-vascular surgery was needed to attach the two main arteries to 
the new face, allowing Mr Hunter’s heart to start supplying it with 
blood.

Transformation: Mitch, pictured during the documentary which followed his operation, said he can now feel the breeze on his face and his girlfriend's kiss.

Overjoyed: Mr Hunter, pictured with his son Clayton, said he hoped the procedure would transform his life

Five months after the U.S. 
military-funded operation at Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston 
and Mr Hunter is starting to see some of his old features starting to 
come through as the swelling subsides.

His
speech is rapidly improving and he is able to do simple things like 
smile, purse his lips and scrunch his eyes. He can feel his son touch 
his face and can also do something he couldn’t do even before the 
accident - grow a beard.

He said: ‘This face is really starting
to feel more and more like mine every day and the sensation that I’ve 
gained back is just extraordinary.

‘I
can feel the breeze on my face now. I can feel heat. It’s just amazing 
how much sensation I’ve gained back in such a short time.’

Epic: The team of more than 30 physicians, nurses, anaesthesiologists and residents worked for more than 14 hours to replace Mr Hunter's face

Permanent reminder: Mitch still has scars on his head following the micro-vascular surgery to rebuild his appearance

Peter Butler, who hopes to carry
out Britain’s first face transplant at London’s Royal Free Hospital, 
believes the technique could one day benefit millions around the world.

He
said: ‘There are a quarter of a million people in the UK with severe 
facial disfigurement for whom reconstructive surgery has not worked.

‘They get stared at and they don’t blend into a crowd. That’s what most of them want, just to be normal.’

* Mitch’s story is told in Frontline Medicine on BBC2 at 9pm on Sunday.
