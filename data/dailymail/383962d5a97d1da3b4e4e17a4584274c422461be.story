The world’s first-ever flat pack home that was shipped to Britain 140 years ago is on the market - for £500,000.

Grade II-listed Burton Hall was built in Norway in the 1870s then painstakingly dismantled and sent to England in sections.

The historic country nine-bedroom mansion was rebuilt in North Tawton, Devon, close to Dartmoor National Park.

John Fulford, a wealthy wool merchant, is believed to have fallen in love with the house on his travels to Scandinavia.

He returned home and had the 6,000 sq ft timber property brought back with him to Devon - where it has withstood the elements for nearly a century and a half.

Since then the sturdy, spacious dwelling, also known as the Old Norse Lodge, has served as both a family home and a snooker club.

The home was built decades before Ikea rolled out its own flat-pack BoKlok homes in Gateshead in 2007.

Estate agent Helmore is marketing it as an 'incredible mid-Victorian detached mansion house with a fascinating history'.

A spokesman the estate agent said: 'The nine bedroomed accommodation is extremely capacious and extends to over 6000 square feet, plus a large basement.

'Its current arrangement includes two internal annexes - one on the ground floor and the other on the first floor - although there is so much flexibility in possible layouts that this could easily be altered to suit.

'Burton Hall is one of the most intriguing and fascinating properties I’ve seen in many years. It has an incredible presence and certainly wouldn’t look out of place on a film set.'
