After sleeping with 10,091 men over 12 years in a drug and alcohol induced haze, former escort Gwyneth Montenegro is finally ready to settle down and experience true love for the first time.

The 36-year-old  received an astounding 80 marriage proposals after the last time the Melbourne resident spoke to Daily Mail Australia in July about the launch of her book, 10,000 Men and Counting.

The overwhelming response to the insight into her former seedy lifestyle got Gwyneth thinking that maybe she was ready to meet a good man - something she never felt comfortable doing when being paid $500 to $1000 an hour to have sex with well-known  lawyers, politicians and musicians.

After sleeping with 10,091 men over 12 years in a drug and alcohol induced haze, former escort Gwyneth Montenegro is finally ready to settle down and find true love

She didnt think it was appropriate to enter into relationships while working as an escort

The male clients gave a good insight into what a man likes in a woman

'It awoke something within me when the article was published - not that I'm in a rush to be married,' she said.

'There were some working in the industry who were dating people and married but for me personally I didn't find it appropriate.'

'I found it easier to avoid relationships during my time in the industry. The two just don't mix. I tried it once, it was an utter disaster.'

Since leaving her old life behind three years ago, Ms Montenegro wears many hats as a commercial pilot, an NLP Master Practitioner and, of course, now an author.

'I was a little over men at that point in time of my life and found my businesses infinitely more stimulating,' she said.

But Gwyneth is now ready and raring to give the dating game a go.

'My parents didn't get married until their late 30s and they have been married for 33 years,' she said.

Despite growing up in a contrast world being raised by devout Christians, her parents are her number one supporters.

'Mum joked that she thought I would have had enough of men by now,' she laughed. 

Ms Montenegro said the years of men paying her for sex gave her a good insight into what men want from a woman.

'Clients would confide in me about the good and bad parts of their relationship,' she said.

'I feel I have a deeper understanding of men than ever before.' 

Gwyneth describes herself as 'fairly introverted and conservative'

Writing the book was a therapeutic experience that helped Gwyneth to discover her true self and become comfortable with it - as she describes herself as the 'girl next door'.

'I'm fairly introverted and conservative,' she said. 'I'm the last person my friends ever expected to have lived that kind of life.'

Gwyneth fell into the escort world after she was gang-raped during a night-out at a club at just 18 years-old when her low self-esteem and lust for money led her to table top dancing before heading into sex work.

After dabbling in the online dating game and deciding it wasn't for her, she believes that relationships should evolve organically.

'I believe in the energy I put out there I will get back,' she explains.

Gwyneth has only ever been in two relationships before that lasted about a year.

'I’m contemplating it, I’d love to. I’ve never really experienced what you’d consider true love or what it’s like to be totally in love.' 

Gwyneth has slept with more than 10,000 men and has written a book about her time as an escort

Hollywood has come knocking keen to tell the story of Gwyneth's former life

She is now a woman who well and truly knows what she is looking for.

'I can be a handful, I am headstrong and determined. I like a man who is calmly confident, in charge, but not bombastically so,' she said.

'I’ve spent a lifetime looking after my body and I respect that in any potential partner. 

'He certainly doesn’t have to be a model or a muscle bound fireman, I’d give preference to a fun personality any day.'

Gwyneth's former life, which involved blowing tens of thousands of dollars on a new car, clothes and cocaine, has sparked interest from Hollywood with Gywneth in secret negotiations with a famous producer.

'I can't say at the moment but everyone would know who she is - it is most likely going to happen,' she said. 

'It's quite a long process but we should know this month or the next.' 

She likes a man who is: 'calmly confident, in charge, but not bombastically so'

She said she can be a 'handful' because she is headstrong and determined 

Gwyneth finally achieved her dream of becoming a fully licensed commercial pilot at 29 years old
