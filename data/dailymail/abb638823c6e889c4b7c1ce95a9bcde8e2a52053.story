Chilling new images released by ISIS militants show a group of fighters throwing a man off the roof of a building  for being gay - as others pictures emerge of bloodied 'rapists' being strung up in the streets of the same town. 

Moments before he is flung to his death, a mob of at least eight men can be seen atop of the building that is believed to be somewhere in northern Iraq.

The images were posted on a jihadist website just hours after US senate report - described a ‘a stain' on American values - revealed the sadistic abuse of CIA detainees in a network of secret prisons around the world.  

After dragging the man to the top of a building the mob threw him to his death after he was found guilty by an Islamic court of being gay

Heavily armed, balaclava clad Islamic State fighters read the judgement which said the man who was found guilty of being gay, should be thrown off the highest point in the city, which is believed to be somewhere in northern Iraq

It is not known whether the man died instantly after being thrown from the roof. The Islamic court ruled that he should also be stoned to death

Three men who were said to be 'rapists', were tied to a bridge on a street corner and left for dead

Pictures have also been posted online that show three men, whose faces are bloodied and swollen, being tethered to a fence on a street corner. One man is blindfolded while the other two are gagged.

But while there has been soul searching in the US and demands in the UK for a full inquiry into the Blair government’s involvement in the CIA’s shameful torture programme, the ISIS fighters have tried to justify their brutal execution. 

'The Islamic court in Wilayet al-Furat decided that a man who has practised sodomy must be thrown off the highest point in the city,'  they said in a statement accompanying the images, adding that he would also be 'stoned to death.'

Wilayet al-Furat refers to an area stretching across the Syrian-Iraqi frontier, where the Euphrates river flows from Syria into Iraq. 

It is not known whether the man died instantly after being thrown off the roof. 

It is the third time in less than a month that the jihadist group has used the brutal execution method for alleged homosexuality.

After claiming they found videos on his mobile phone showing him 'practicing indecent acts with males,' a 20-year old man was stoned to death in the Syrian province of  Deir Ezzor in late November, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

The London based activist group also claimed that an 18-year-old man was subjected to the same punishment in a separate incident.

Public executions are popular with the group who rule parts of northern Iraq and Syria with an iron fist, meting out harsh punishments for actions they see as violating their interpretation of Islamic law, such as adultery, stealing and blasphemy. 

They have also killed a smaller number of foreign captives. 

With children watching in the crowd, the group beheaded a man in northern Syria after accusing him of 'offending Allah' yesterday, reported the Observatory, which tracks the conflict using its own sources on the ground.

A statement posted on a jihadist website said the man admitted to blasphemy before being killed in the countryside of Raqqa province, which the hard line group controls. 

Graphic images showing each man, and the location where they were tied up, were published online

One of the tethered men was blindfolded while the other two were gagged; their clothes were all soaked in blood and their faces were bloodied; one man's eyes were swollen shut

Al Qaeda in Yemen commander Nasr bin Ali al-Ansi

A senior commander of Al Qaeda in Yemen has blasted his ISIS rivals for carrying out beheadings calling them 'very barbaric' and 'unacceptable' in the name of Jihad.

Although his group is suspected a number of executions, including the beheading of 15 Yemeni soldiers in August, Nasr bin Ali al-Ansi claimed that the executions were were 'individual acts' and not endorsed by the leadership. 

'Filming and promoting it among people in the name of Islam and Jihad is a big mistake and not acceptable whatever the justifications are,' al-Ansi said in a video response to questions by reporters posted on one of the group's Twitter accounts. 

'This is very barbaric,' he added in the video which appeared to have recorded the interview before British born hostage Luke Somers and  South African teacher Pierre Korkie were killed by militants during a rescue attempt by US special forces. 

The Yemeni branch of the terror group is, known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is seen by the US as the group's most dangerous al Qaeda affiliate globally.

The group has criticized ISIS before for trying to expand its territory. 

Al-Ansi went on to say that the drone strikes stoke popular outrage that boosts al Qaeda's popularity.

'While they kill some of the jihadis, the U.S. drone strikes increase the sympathy of Muslims with us,' he said, adding, 'thanks to the blood of the martyrs, the call for jihad spreads.'
