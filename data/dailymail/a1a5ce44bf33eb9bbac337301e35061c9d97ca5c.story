In court: Constance Briscoe, who is accused of perverting the course of justice by lying to police about how she helped friend Vicky Pryce expose her ex-husband Chris Huhne

Britain's top black female judge plotted to bring down Chris Huhne by lying to police about the speeding points scandal, a court heard yesterday.

Constance Briscoe, 56, was said to be ‘determined to go for the kill’ after the then Cabinet Minister denied making his ex-wife Vicky Pryce take speeding points on his behalf.

The subsequent exposure of the points row led to Huhne’s resignation and prison terms for the former couple.

Southwark Crown Court heard Briscoe repeatedly lied to police. She allegedly said that her Clapham neighbours Huhne and Pryce were ‘associates’ who she only saw at parties because their children were friends.

But in reality the barrister and part-time judge ‘was quite intent’ on destroying Huhne, 59, and was in contact with journalists as early as 2010, just months after he and Pryce split, it was alleged.

One journalist said at the time: ‘She is determined to go in for the kill. Unlike VP [Vicky Pryce], she is nicely out of the spotlight and just wants Huhne to get his “comeuppance” i.e. lose his position as Energy Secretary and be exposed as a liar.’

The Mail on Sunday was forced to disclose material showing it was in contact with Briscoe by a court order applied for by Huhne.

Jurors heard that between May 2011 and October 2012, Briscoe made two ‘inaccurate and misleading’ signed witness statements.

She then altered her statement to change its meaning on October 6, 2012, they heard.

She faces a third charge of falsifying a document between October 2012 and October 2013 after she was charged with perverting the course of justice.

Yesterday Briscoe, who has been suspended from the judiciary since her arrest in 2012, sat in the dock staring at the floor. Prosecutor Bobbie Cheema, QC, said: ‘Put very simply . . . Constance Briscoe helped a friend of hers, a woman called Vicky Pryce, to provide information to the media.’

While this was not illegal, she said, 
Briscoe is accused of ‘hiding what she was really up to when the police 
asked her about it, giving the police misleading information and later 
on trying to manipulate both the police and the court  during an 
investigation into her, Miss Briscoe’s, own actions’.

Huhne and Pryce were each jailed for eight months last year after it emerged Pryce had taken speeding points for Huhne in 2003.

In
 her police statement, Briscoe claimed that Pryce told her about the 
incident in May 2003. She said: ‘She was absolutely furious . . . she 
said that he had nominated her without her knowledge in a car which he 
had been driving.’

Briscoe 
said she told Pryce that Huhne should ‘come clean’, but Pryce said he 
would probably lose his licence if he got more points.

The
 jury heard Briscoe was due to be a prosecution witness in Huhne and 
Pryce’s trial, but was deemed not to be a reliable or truthful  witness.
 Miss Cheema said: ‘She is a professional lawyer, indeed she is a 
practising criminal barrister with dozens of years’ experience.

‘Despite
 all her advantages . . . she was prepared to lie to police, she was 
prepared to present an entirely false picture about her relationship 
with Miss Pryce.’

She added 
that the justice system relies ‘on lawyers having the utmost integrity 
in all their dealings in the course of justice’.

Briscoe denies three counts of perverting the course of justice.

The trial continues.
