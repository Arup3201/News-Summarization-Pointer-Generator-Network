The NSW corruption watchdog has found former Labor MPs Eddie Obeid and Joe Tripodi engaged in corrupt conduct.

The finding by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) relates to retail leases at Circular Quay on the Sydney harbour foreshore in which Mr Obeid's family had financial interests.

ICAC also made a finding of corrupt conduct against Steve Dunn, the former deputy chief executive officer and property division head of the Maritime Authority of NSW.

'The commission finds that Mr Obeid misused his position as an MP to make representations to ministers and Mr Dunn on various occasions in relation to the management of retail leases at Circular Quay,' the watchdog said in its report released on Thursday.

The representations were made to former Labor minister Carl Scully around 2000, and former ministers Michael Costa and Eric Roozendaal between 2003 and 2006, involving the terms of the leases.

In Mr Scully's case, ICAC said it was suggested the minister consider offering new leases with five-year terms and options for renewal for five years.

This was at a time when Mr Obeid knew the leaseholders had donated $50,000 to the Australian Labor Party as payment for carrying out what they understood to be a promise that their interests would be 'looked after'.

Mr Costa and Mr Roozendaal were asked to consider changing government policy to allow direct negotiations for new leases with existing leaseholders, rather than hold an open tender process, ICAC said.

But Mr Obeid did not disclose his family had an interest in the Circular Quay leases and would benefit financially if the policy was changed.

Mr Obeid also made a similar representation to Mr Tripodi.

'Mr Tripodi engaged in corrupt conduct in 2007 by deliberately failing to disclose to his cabinet colleagues his awareness of the Obeid family's financial interests in Circular Quay leases,' ICAC said.

'Mr Dunn engaged in corrupt conduct in 2007 by using his public official position to benefit Mr Obeid and the Obeid family by effectively bringing about a change to the commercial lease policy, to allow for direct negotiations with existing Circular Quay leaseholders.'

ICAC said the Director of Public Prosecutions should be asked to consider prosecuting Mr Obeid for criminal offences of misconduct in public office. It did not make a similar recommendation about Mr Tripodi.

Mr Obeid likened ICAC to a Hollywood production, saying he thought there was a 'one per cent' chance of the DPP bringing a case against him.

'If and when it does turn up, if ever it will turn up in a court of law, we will defend it vigorously because we are innocent of any of the allegations which ICAC's brought up,' he told ABC radio.

He described ICAC's investigations into him as a political witch-hunt.

'It is all a media spectacle and it is all Hollywood style and it is all about grabbing media headlines,' he said.

Joe Tripodi has been expelled from the Australian Labor Party, in light of the latest NSW corruption watchdog findings.

NSW Labor general secretary Jamie Clements announced in a statement that Mr Tripodi's membership, which had previously been suspended, would now be cancelled immediately.

A meeting of the party's administrative committee would be held on Friday, he said.

Mr Obeid was expelled from the Labor Party in 2013.
