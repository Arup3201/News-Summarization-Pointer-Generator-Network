Sunderland have expressed an interest in Manchester United striker Danny Welbeck as they grow increasingly exasperated over a deal for Liverpool's Fabio Borini.

Welbeck was the subject of a £12million offer from Hull but has opted against joining up with Steve Bruce. 

The 23-year-old is weighing up what role he has to play at United but may attract more interest in the next few weeks.

The move from Sunderland comes after Gus Poyet was confident he would nab Borini from Anfield.

Their £14m was accepted for the striker who spent last season at the Stadium of Light. 

Borini, though, remains undecided as to where his future lies, and Poyet, whose side kicked off with a 2-2 draw at West Brom on Saturday, said: ‘It’s still ongoing. I can assure the supporters it’s not over.'
