Warning: Chancellor George Osborne said families in Scotland will be worse off if voters back independence next year

People living in Scotland would each be £2,000 better off if they vote against independence, George Osbonre claimed today.

The Chancellor said incomes would rise by four per cent after 30 years, equivalent to £5billion in today’s prices.

But if voters choose to sever ties with the UK in next year;s independence referendum, Scotland would have to make ‘very substantial cuts’ of up to £8billion in public spending, Mr Osborne suggested.

A new Treasury report published today says that incomes in Scotland are likely to increase if the country chooses to stay in the Union rather than vote for independence.

It argues that ‘remaining part of the borderless United Kingdom could boost real incomes in Scotland by as much as 4 per cent after 30 years, equivalent to £5 billion in 2012 prices or £2,000 per household’.

The report adds: ‘Independence would fundamentally transform and fragment this relationship, ending the pooling of resources and risk-sharing between Scotland and the rest of the UK, and erecting a border where one doesn’t currently exist.

By contrast, the analysis suggests that exports from an independent Scotland to the continuing UK could be over 80 per cent lower after 30 years.

Mr Osborne, who delivered a speech in Aberdeen to the oil and gas industry, said it would take £8 billion out of the budget to divert revenue into a an oil fund after independence

Scotland can ‘go it alone’, he said, but as part of the UK it has a broader base to ‘absorb’ fluctuations in the revenue.

He dismissed the idea that Scotland could set up an oil fund, like in Norway, without making severe public spending cuts.

‘By our calculation you'd have to make some very substantial cuts - £8 billion of cuts - to Scottish public spending,’ he told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme.

‘Even if you were getting all the money from Scottish oil, you'd have to make big, big cuts – 5 per cent of the GDP - to your education budget, to your health budget, before you could even start putting money into an oil fund.’

However, the claims were dismissed by the Scottish government.

A spokesman for Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ‘With household budgets expected to fall by £1,800 in the next two years as part of the UK – and at least another four years of cuts to Scotland’s budget – it is only a Yes vote in 2014 that can deliver real opportunities for Scotland.

‘Westminster’s economic policies have seen key industries close down, communities abandoned and generations of Scots let down.’

Referendum: Voters will have their say on independence on September 18 2014

Scottish voters will have their say on leaving the UK in a referendum on September 18 next year.

Most opinion polls have shown support for independence in the high twenties.

But a surprise new Panelbase survey, commissioned by the SNP put the Yes campaign one point ahead on 44 per cent.

The Treasury analysis says that there would be two ‘fundamental fiscal consequences’ if Scotland became an independent country.

Dispute: The Independence debate has been dominated by wrangling over the value and access to revenues from Scotland's oil supplies

Firstly, Scotland would need to rely on a narrower and more volatile tax base to fund spending on public services, according to the Treasury.

Secondly, independence would result in the break-up of the UK tax system. A separate tax system would need to be implemented in Scotland with potential implications for business, individuals and both governments.

Mr Osborne will also unveil the final decommissioning deed - a contract which gives oil and gas companies certainty over the level of tax relief that they will receive for decommissioning.

Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney said: ‘North Sea oil is a bonus, not the basis for Scotland's economy and, with up to 24 billion barrels of oil left worth an estimated £1.5 trillion, it will continue to contribute to the wealth of Scotland for a long time to come.

‘Leaving decisions at Westminster has cost Scotland 30 years of an oil fund and it was only the vociferous arguments of the industry and the Scottish Government that prevented investment being set back by years.

‘The Scottish Government has made clear commitments to the industry that demonstrate the benefits of decisions being made in Scotland and that means a Yes vote next year will secure a strong future for Scotland's oil industry.’
