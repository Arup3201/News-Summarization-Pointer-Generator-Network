Archer is now beginning a three-year jail term after admitting fraud and obtaining money by deception

As a former council ‘employee of the year’ and the head of crime prevention initiatives in his home town, David Archer’s reputation was impeccable.

But behind the quiet, hard-working facade, the divorced father-of-six was stealing large sums from his employer.

The senior manager for Chelmsford Council in Essex made more than £230,000 over six years by routing funds into bogus accounts of playground equipment suppliers.

He is now beginning a three-year jail term after admitting fraud and obtaining money by deception.

Judge Christopher Ball QC told him: ‘That money was spent not on a lavish lifestyle but more comfortable living for you and your family. The payments effectively doubled your salary, doubled it dishonestly.

‘It is often thought that when a large organisation or public authority loses out it is a victimless crime. I don’t think the ratepayers will see it that way.

‘There will be proceedings in an attempt to claw back as much as possible from you to make sure ratepayers are reimbursed.’ 

Archer, 56, joined the council 25 years ago and was employee of the year in 2001.

At one point he was chairman of the Crime and Disorder Partnership alongside the police.

Suspicions arose about him in 2010 when council officers questioned payments to two charities.

Further inquiries revealed he had falsely claimed £232,456 from 2004 to 2010 in the name of two fictitious organisations, Essex Play Council and Chelmsford & Maldon Gold Plus. They were registered to his home in Chelmsford.

Father-of-six Archer, 56, joined the council 25 years ago and was named as employee of the year in 2001

The proceeds of the fraud were paid into his personal bank account and a joint account with his then wife, Nicola.

The simple fraud involved submitting ‘vague’ invoices for play equipment and youth projects, signed off by Archer. He left a ‘clear and obvious’ audit trail, Chelmsford Crown Court heard.

His wage averaged £2,353 a month but over the same period his monthly outgoings were £4,875.

Christopher Paxton, defending, said: ‘The lack of control at Chelmsford Council was extraordinary. This lack of control fuelled his greed.’

The council confirmed it will seek to recover the stolen funds.
