What a difference a year makes. At the beginning of April last year, Sir Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United headed into the derby at Old Trafford 15 points clear of Manchester City.  

On Tuesday evening, it is Manuel Pellegrini’s City who will stroll into their neighbours’ backyard with a strut of arrogance, knowing United’s status has been diminished to that of inferiors.  

This time it is they who sit in the ascendency, 12 points ahead of David Moyes’ ailing side. A win would convert 12 into 15.

Two more victories in City’s games in hand on United and the gap would become 21. It is a prospect barely worth thinking about for those at Old Trafford, offering a frightening snapshot of just how far United have plummeted in the post-Ferguson era.

Yet there would also be little surprise if United were to surrender once more. After all, they have won just one match in 12 against the top nine in the Barclays Premier League this season, losing seven of those.

It is not difficult to see, therefore, why City are the bookmakers’ favourites to win a match at Old Trafford for the first time since the inception of the Premier League.  

City have inflicted the odd flesh wound in the past, of course. Kevin Keegan’s side, with Jon Macken up front rather than Sergio Aguero, as the main man beat United 4-1 at the City of Manchester Stadium in 2004.

More cuttingly, there was that 6-1 
two years ago at Old Trafford, leaving Ferguson ‘shattered’ after the 
‘worst result in my history, ever’. And then there was the last-gasp 
Aguero goal to snatch the title from United in the most dramatic manner 
possible. 

These were 
body-blows to the United system but they were swiftly corrected, first 
through the signing of Robin van Persie, ahead of City, and 
then by reclaiming the title in Ferguson’s final season.

It's been 44 years since Manchester City beat United in three consecutive league matches.

City could break this run if they win at Old Trafford on Wednesday.

The Blues won 2-1 at Old Trafford last April before battering David Moyes' side 4-1 in his first derby at the Etihad in September.

So, can they make it three on the bounce once again? 

It is a very long time indeed since United were last unequivocally considered the weaker force in Manchester and that should be a serious concern within the walls of Old Trafford. 

Certainly, it has never been the case in the Premier League era. Indeed, only twice before have United entered a Manchester derby at home in the Premier League trailing City on points.

Before the 6-1 in 2012, City were two points ahead of Ferguson’s side but that was after just eight games.

The only other occasion was an anomaly, in September 2005, when United were one point behind Stuart Pearce’s City. City had played four games to United three, meaning that particular statistic was rather skewed.

Relief for United: Aguero has been ruled out of Tuesday's derby with a hamstring injury

The turnaround can perhaps be more readily attributed to United’s decline than City’s development in this past year.

Intriguingly, for all the calmness instilled by their phlegmatic manager, City are only four points better off than they were after 28 games last season.

United, by contrast, are 26 points worse off than they were at the same stage last season. All things considered, it does not require much this season to be more formidable than Moyes’ side.

But we should not forget that is new territory for City supporters, for the first time indisputably the dominant outfit. Previously, this would be the stuff of printed T-shirts. Now, it is par for the course.

This can be rammed home if Pellegrini’s side secure a third consecutive league victory at Old Trafford on Tuesday night.

That has not happened for more than 40 years, when City won five games in a row at the home of United between 1967 and 1972.

It would be the latest of a succession of records to topple under Moyes and fresh on the back of a 3-0 humiliation by Liverpool, defeat against City would provide compelling evidence that the tide has turned irretrievably in Manchester.

Dropping below City or Liverpool is one thing, to fall below the two is another thing entirely. But that is the unacceptable reality that the rank-and-file at Old Trafford may be just obliged to accept come Tuesday evening at The Theatre of Dreams.
