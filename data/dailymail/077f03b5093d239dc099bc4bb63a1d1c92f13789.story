A dispute over organ donation is delaying the death of a brain-dead two-year-old girl who was taken off life support on Friday, two days after her stepfather fatally shook her, police said.

Thaiya Spruill-Smith was pronounced dead on Friday night after suffering severe head injuries and internal wounds allegedly at the hands of her mother's 25-year-old husband David Adams.

But the toddler remains hooked up to machines keeping her organs alive as her mother Teoka Spruill, 24, and father Terrell Smith, 26, argue over whether or not to donate her organs.  

Tragic: Thaiya Spruill-Smith, two, was taken off life support on Saturday after suffering a brain hemorrhage

'She was born with that, she's going to be buried with that, her body, her eyes - it's what makes her her,' Smith told the New York Times from Thaiya's hospital bed in Brookdale Hospital, New York. 

'My daughter was born with that, and she's going to lie down with the same thing.'

Speaking separately, Spruill told the paper: 'I just think it would be a blessing for someone else's family.'

There will be an autopsy on Thaiya's body as her death is the subject of a criminal investigation. 

Her death certificate will state Friday as her date of death, regardless. 

The parental dispute is reportedly the latest in a series spanning Thaiya's lifetime, as Smith claims he made repeated attempts to save her from Adams, who he claims was abusive.

The two-year-old was rushed to Brookdale Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, shortly before 7am on Thursday after her  mother noticed she was struggling to breathe.

Despite numerous operations, doctors concluded Thaiya's injuries were too severe to overcome and she was taken off life support. 

It has since emerged that Thaiya may have been the victim of months of abuse at the hands of her stepfather that was investigated by New York City social services.

Relatives have made emotional tributes to the 'smart' and 'sweet' girl as her mother's husband David Adams, 25, appeared in court charged with inflicting the fatal wounds.

Anger: Her father Terrell Smith says she was being systematically abused by her mother's new husband

'Thai, she was like the sweetest little girl ever, like you wouldn't have problems with her ever,' Shayne Smith, Thaiya's uncle, told Time Warner Cable.

'She was very smart - very, very smart.'

According to court documents, Adams admitted to shaking Thaiya when questioned.

And police sources say there are records of a similar shaking incident in the household last month.

Judge Michael Gerstein plans to upgrade Adams' charge from assault to attempted murder once Thaiya's autopsy has been carried out, the New York Daily News reported. 

Adams, who married Thaiya's mother in March, wept before prosecutors in court as they told him the two-year-old had died.

'He was shocked. He was very, very upset,' defense attorney Joseph Sieger told the New York Post. 

Smith said social services took custody of the little girl for a week while they investigated Adams for abuse.

She was returned and the case was dropped, he said.

The ACS has refused to confirm or deny Smith's claims due to confidentiality restrictions.

Paramedics were called to the home in the Brownsville area of Brooklyn shortly before 7am on Thursday.

According to Smith, she had already had the injuries for days.

Spruill, Thaiya's mother, is the half-sister of Tiona Rodriguez, who was caught carrying her dead baby son in a plastic bag in Victoria's Secret last year, then aged 17.
