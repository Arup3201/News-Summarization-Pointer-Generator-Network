Discount chains Aldi and Lidl have claimed a new scalp following revelations that Sainsbury’s has suffered its first fall in sales for nine years.

Same store sales slumped by 3.1per cent in the 10 weeks to March 15 compared to a year ago, which was worse than City analysts expected.

The figures are a blow to the reputation of the chief executive Justin King, who is leaving the business later this year and had hoped to maintain his record of success.

Sainsbury's saw a 3.1 per cent fall in sales in the 10 weeks to March 15 which was bigger than predicted

Last week, Morrisons signalled a supermarket price war with cuts worth at least £1billion over the next three years in a response to the challenge posed by Aldi and Lidl.

Billions of pounds were wiped off the share values of all the leading chains, including Sainsbury’s, amid predictions that they will have to cut prices and profit margins to compete.

Sainsbury’s likes to see itself as being a cut above the mainstream supermarkets in terms of quality on its own label ranges which, in theory, justifies higher prices.

However, it has been forced to slash the price of milk, bread and eggs in recent days to prevent customers deserting to cheaper rivals.

At the same time, a succession of independent taste tests have shown that the quality of own label foods from Aldi and Lidl regularly beats the mainstream supermarkets, including Sainsbury’s.

Just last week, Lidl won the own brand range of the year at the Oracle Retail Week Awards, while Aldi was named retailer of the year.

Aldi has been blamed in part for the fall, with their own-brand products consistently beating the likes of bigger chains in blind taste tests, with discount store Lidl also putting pressure on established brands

Both the German-owned chains have made a concerted effort to target Middle Britain shoppers with fresh produce,

Aberdeen Angus fillet steaks at £5 each, lobsters, caviar and award-winning wines, coffee and Continental cheeses.

Unlike the mainstream supermarkets they have much smaller ranges of each product, whether it is tinned tomatoes or breakfast cereal, which allows them to keep prices down.

The boss of Morrisons, Dalton Philips, says that high streets are undergoing the biggest structural change since the 1950s because of the cost of living squeeze and a permanent switch to using budget stores.

High street expert, Natalie Berg, Global Research Director, Planet Retail, said Sainsbury’s faces a huge challenge to hang on to customers.

‘Today’s results show that even the darling of the grocery sector is no longer insulated from the discount threat,’ she said.

The news will be a blow to Sainsbury's chief executive Justin King who leaves the company this year and will have hoped to continue his run of positive results

‘Aldi and Lidl are morphing into credible grocery players by expanding their ranges and opening in more attractive locations, placing them in an enviable position when it comes to top-up shopping.’

Lidl, for example, has plans to open a store within 100 yards of Richmond Bridge in south west London, which is one of the wealthiest boroughs in the UK.

Mss Berg said: ‘Shoppers don’t want to trawl through 13 varieties of tomatoes and they don’t want to bring a calculator to work out if they’re getting a genuine deal. They want convenience, simplicity of choice and honest prices.

‘The challenge for Sainsbury’s will be regaining lost market share. Once a shopper tries Aldi or Lidl, they tend to stick with them.’  

Planet Retail expects sales through discount stores to rise by 64per cent - £8billion – by 2020 to some £20billion a year.

Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said: ‘The march of the discount supermarkets continues to threaten prospects.

‘Last week’s Morrison-induced share price tumble has contributed to a 21per cent decline in the share price over the last six months alone.’

The Sainsbury’s chief executive played down the challenge posed by Aldi and Lidl and the move by Morrisons to reset its prices to a new lower level.

Mr King said: ‘The discounters have been around for years - they’re not a new phenomenon.’

He was dismissive of a price war, claiming it was all part of the ‘cut and thrust’ of the market, adding: ‘We should all be pleased with lower prices and in the long run that’s good for the market.’

Sainsbury’s highlighted the value for money of its popular own-brand ranges, claiming they are 20per cent cheaper than branded equivalents. They now make up 51per cent of all products going through tills.

It also put faith in its growing clothing ranges, boosted by a collaboration with designer Gok Wan, convenience stores and internet grocery delivery service.

Morrisons sparked another price war last week after announcing cuts worth £1billion over three years

Sales through its big box supermarkets are down, however those through convenience outlets are up 15per cent.

Experts at Shore Capital Stockbrokers slashed full-year profit forecasts for Sainsbury’s as they said the sales slide was slightly worse than already- downbeat expectations.

They said: ‘We will be interested to see how Sainsbury’s approaches the greater discount challenge. Whilst it is not losing out to the same extent as its peers, we do not believe that Sainsbury’s is blind to the challenge.’
