Stuart Lancaster doesn’t tend to seek selection guidance from Hollywood actors, but he was given some on Friday, as Russell Crowe made a case for the fast-tracking of his friend Sam Burgess.

The big-screen ‘Gladiator’ is in the UK to watch South Sydney Rabbitohs - the Australian rugby league team he co-owns - compete in Sunday’s World Club Challenge against St Helens at Langtree Park.

Having repeatedly eulogised about Burgess’s heroic contribution to the side’s first NRL title in 43 years, Crowe argued that Bath’s cross-code recruit should be rapidly promoted into the full England squad by head coach Lancaster.

‘Never bet against Sam Burgess when faced with a challenge,’ said the Kiwi – in reference to the 26-year-old’s attempt to hurriedly integrate into union, in time to push for a World Cup place later this year. ‘Sam is a fine young man and is just going to get better.

‘If I was anything to do with English rugby union, I’d just select him in my squad because he’s a very fast learner. You want your top 30 athletes representing the country and he has to be among the top 30 athletes in rugby union right now.’

A number of England squad players will be in action this weekend, after being released back to their clubs - with several on duty at the AJ Bell Stadium in Salford. While Danny Cipriani will return to the Sale No 10 shirt after agreeing a new contract with the club, he will be faced by four Test colleagues in the visiting Saracens team.

Prop Mako Vunipola and scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth will use the Aviva Premiership fixture for valuable game-time ahead of the trip to Dublin to face Ireland next Sunday, while centre Brad Barritt will hope to push his case for a recall to the match-day 23. The main focus will be on Alex Goode, though, as the full-back may be brought back into the England starting XV for the clash with the Irish, if Mike Brown is unable to recover from his concussion in time to play.

Elsewhere, Northampton are still without Courtney Lawes and Tom Wood for their trip to the West Country to take on Bath on Saturday, and Lions prop Alex Corbisiero has to settle for a place on the bench. 

Nick Easter has been reinstated to the Harlequins team as captain, and Exeter will field Jack Nowell at outside centre, ahead of his anticipated return to the England line-up on the wing.
