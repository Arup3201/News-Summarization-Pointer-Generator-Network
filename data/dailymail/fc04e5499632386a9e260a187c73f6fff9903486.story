Ukip faced fresh accusations of double standards today amid claims Eastern Europeans have been hired to hand out flyers in its anti-immigration election campaign.

Latvians have been hired by a firm in Croydon to hand out flyers ahead of elections on May 22.

It follows revelations the party used an Irish actor in a poster about Brits missing out on jobs, as David Cameron today stepped up his attack on Ukip, accusing his rivals of not believing the country has a bright future.

Ukip has launched a £1.5million publicity drive in the hope of triggering a 'political earthquake' by topping the Euro poll on May 22.

But the campaign attacking 'open doors' immigration from the EU has been dogged by allegations of spin, fakery and hypocrisy.

Today it emerged that Ukip flyers were being delivered by Eastern Europeans hired by company Fast Leaflet in Croydon.

Boss Andrew Spalis told the Huffington Post many of his employees are from Latvia and 'only yesterday' had been working for Ukip.

Tory MP Gavin Barwell said: 'Ukip’s hypocrisy knows no bounds. They say they are against Europeans taking our jobs and then, when they have a chance to offer some British people work delivering their leaflets because they can’t find volunteers to do it, they employ European workers.'

The row comes after it emerged that one of the stars of a Ukip poster campaign, who appeared to be a British builder ‘hit hard by unlimited cheap labour’, was actually an Irish actor, Dave O’Rourke.

Today Ukip launched an investigation into a tweet from a party account boasting about its 'indigenous, white candidate' in the Newark by-election, Roger Helmer, who today gave an interview stressing he was now more relaxed about gay people.

David Cameron took another swipe at Ukip during Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons today

Ukip has urged to 18 per cent in the latest Survation poll for the Mirror, with the Tories just one point behind Labour.

The Conservatives have been torn between attacking Ukip and trying to woo its supporters.

But today in the Commons, Mr Cameron accused Ukip of having a negative outlook about the future.

Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions, he said: 'Britain has benefited from being an economy that is open to investment and open to people coming who want to contribute and work hard here.

'So much of their view seems to be that we don't have a bright future in this country.

'I absolutely believe that we do, if we get our deficit down, we get our economy growing, we invest in apprenticeships, we show that we can be one of the success stories of the 21st Century. We're making progress and that is the way to challenge their world view.'

Ukip has made gains in the polls after stepping up its attacks on immigration and the EU.

Yesterday the party confirmed its controversial MEP Roger Helmer will fight the upcoming Newark by-election for the party - despite recent controversy over a series of remarks about homosexuality.

The party's local Twitter account - UKIP Newark - tweeted soon after: Newark: Our indiginous white candidate is ready to rock and roll #LetsDoThis.'

Party aides inititally suggested the account was not official, but later it posted another message stating: 'Several members have access to this account. Tweet deleted. Investigation begun.'

Soon after Roger Helmer was named as Ukip's candidate in the Newark by-electon, the Twitter account UKIPNewark posted this controversial comment

Amid confusion about whether the account was official, this message appeared hours later

Mr Helmer sparked outrage in 2012 after likening gay marriage to incest.

The 70-year-old has also claimed people should be able to prefer being straight to being gay - like some people prefer Earl Grey to ordinary tea.

And in 2000 he said being gay is ‘not worthy of valid equal respect’.

But in an interview with The Times today he said he had relaxed his views, but appeared to suggest gay people are more likely to have threesomes.

Mr Helmer said: 'I was raised in a very traditional home and I guess I grew up with those attitudes, but hell, we are now in the 21st century and my position is exactly the same as the party's position: that we are a broadly libertarian party and what two consenting adults, or indeed more than two consenting adults, choose to do together is none of my business, none of the party's business and as far as we're concerned, they're free to get on with it.'

Roger Helmer has rarely avoided controversy during his career as an MEP, but has been returned to Brussels three times

Mr Helmer's selection comes after Ukip leader Nigel Farage ducked the chance to fight the Nottinghamshire seat.

The byelection was called after the disgraced former Tory MP Patrick Mercer resigned in the wake of a cash-for-questions scandal.

Mr Helmer was elected to the European Parliament in 1999 as the Tory MEP for the East Midlands - and re-elected in 2004 and 2009 - before defecting to Ukip in March 2012.

His outspoken views have caused controversy throughout his career and last year even Mr Farage said he had gone 'too far' with his attack on gay marriage.

In 2012 Mr Helmer said: 'If two men have a right to marry, how can we deny the same right to two siblings? Are we to authorise incest?'

His made the bombshell remarks in a pamphlet entitled 'Straight Talking on Europe'.

Nigel Farage decided not to fight the Newark by-election - leaving himself open to accusations that he 'bottled' his big chance

The year before he asked: 'Why is it OK for a surgeon to perform a sex-change operation, but not OK for a psychiatrist to try to "turn" a consenting homosexual?'

Mr Helmer has also dismissed homophobia as a 'weasel word'. He said: 'The homosexual lobby is not content with decriminalisation. It wants to be accepted as a "valid alternative lifestyle".

'But it is not a valid lifestyle worthy of equal respect.

'At the risk of offending the politically correct, I will argue that homosexual behaviour is abnormal and undesirable.'

He previously questioned the existence of 'homophobia', saying some people found gay relationships 'distasteful if not viscerally repugnant'.

He defended the remarks, saying: 'Different people have different tastes. You may tell me you don't like Earl Grey tea. That may be a minority view but you are entitled not to like it if you don't like it.

The Ukip candidate added: 'I simply made the point that people were entitled to their personal preferences.

'It is morally acceptable to prefer heterosexuality over homosexuality, or vice versa. Most of us prefer one or the other.'

He later added: 'I said that people may prefer heterosexuality or homosexuality. I did not say that people could dislike – much less hate – other people on the grounds of their sexual orientation.

'The mainstream media are engaged in a feeding frenzy against Ukip, and are prepared to twist the facts to suit their agenda.'

Mr Helmer also insists that he has condemned homophobia during his career.

He said 'prejudice, hostility and violence against homosexuals are wrong and totally unacceptable'.

But Mr Helmer's controversial views are not restricted to homosexuality.

He has claimed that women who are date raped must ‘share part of the responsibility’.

Mr Helmer said in 'stranger rape' the blame was 'squarely on the perpetrator' but in date rape cases 'the victim surely shares a part of the responsibility, if only for establishing reasonable expectations in her boyfriend’s mind'.

The outspoken MEP has also claimed the Catholic Church was ‘systematically paedophilic’.  

He said: ‘So far as I know it has no rules or systems designed to support or promote paedophilia.

'But I think it would be perfectly fair to describe it as systemically paedophile.’

Despite Mr Helmer's controversial past, he was 'overwhelmingly' endorsed by the Newark constituency association at a hustings meeting on Monday before being backed by Ukip's National Executive Committee, a party spokesman said.

Mr Helmer said: 'I am both proud and humbled to have been selected by the constituency association in Newark to represent the UKIP cause in this historic town in what could well prove to be an historic by-election.'

'It would be a huge honour to be elected to serve as Newark’s MP and I will be giving my all over the next few weeks to achieve that outcome.'

Mr Farage said: 'He is a massively experienced and respected figure on the national political stage and on the local political stage as well.

'I know that the Ukip membership will rally to the cause of making Roger our first directly elected MP.'

The Newark by-election is scheduled to take place on June 5, with the Conservatives selecting Robert Jenrick to run and Labour represented by Michael Payne. The Lib Dems are expected to choose a candidate in the coming days.
