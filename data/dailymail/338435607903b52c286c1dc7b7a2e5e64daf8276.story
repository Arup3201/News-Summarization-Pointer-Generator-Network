Head of Ofsted, Sir Michael Wilshaw, will warn too many state secondaries still struggle to provide educational ‘basics’

The number of children being taught in failing secondary schools has risen to 170,000 – despite a drive to boost standards, the head of Ofsted will reveal today.

Some 147 schools are now in special measures, a rise of 62 per cent, while those given top ratings remains the same.

Sir Michael Wilshaw will cite the data as evidence that standards have stagnated – and progress could even go into reverse.

Despite giving heads more freedom to run their own affairs, he will warn that too many state secondaries still struggle to provide educational 'basics' – with 'indifferent' teaching and poor discipline.

Launching his annual report, Sir Michael will reveal how the number of pupils being taught in schools rated 'inadequate' by Ofsted has risen by 70,000 in two years to 170,000. At the same time, the proportion of schools given Ofsted's top ratings – good and outstanding – remains unchanged on last year at about 70 per cent.

While primary schools are continuing to 'forge ahead', improvements at secondary level have 'plateaued', he will say.

In too many cases, secondaries are allowing bad behaviour to go unchallenged and are led by 'weak' head teachers and governors who lack oversight of standards.

Sir Michael – the chief inspector of schools – will add that many secondaries 'lack meaningful support' despite the Government's academies programme which has seen hundreds of schools govern themselves or hand over management to sponsors.

In a speech to launch his third annual report, he will call for an end to 'sterile' debates about how schooling should be structured.

'Where schools are failing, it is not because they are local authority schools or academies, or because they are part of a multi-academy trust or because they stand alone,' he will tell an audience. 'They are failing because they haven't got the essentials right: governance and oversight is weak, leadership is poor, misbehaviour goes unchallenged and teaching is indifferent.

'If our education system is to continue to progress we need to concentrate on the basics of why schools and colleges fail and why they succeed.' He will also call for stronger monitoring of struggling schools which had become 'isolated' and lacked support from local authorities or sponsors.

'These schools are deprived of effective support when times are bad,' he will say.

'They are left unchallenged when they flirt with complacency. In many cases they are totally insulated from effective governance. They are bereft of good leadership and teaching practice. They remain apart from schools that could partner them.'

In contrast, Sir Michael will highlight the performance of schools rated 'outstanding' which he says are doing a 'superb job' and creating a 'strong learning ethos'.

And he will argue that primaries have continued to improve, largely because heads and governors are 'getting the basics right' – such as the effective teaching of the 'phonics' reading method.

Alongside a national report, Sir Michael will also publish eight regional reports. It will show that in 13 local authority areas, fewer than half of secondary schools are rated good or outstanding by Ofsted.
