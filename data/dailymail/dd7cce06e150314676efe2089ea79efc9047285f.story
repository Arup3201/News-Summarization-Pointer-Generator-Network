A 15-year-old girl who miraculously survived a bear attack has credited her dog Ralph with saving her life by lunging at the animal while she played dead.

Leah Reeder sustained deep bites and gouges to her legs, back, neck and face, after the attack on Sunday in Eastpoint, Franklin County, on Florida's panhandle. 

She was out walking Ralph, a springer spaniel, at 6pm when the bear suddenly appeared and tackled her.

Speaking to the Apalach Times from her hospital bed, she said the bear pushed her down, and she rolled on to her front side and started screaming.

Injured: Leah Reeder, pictured, said her dog Ralph managed to scare away a bear that attacked her as they took a walk. After pretending to play dead, her dog started yapping and lunging at the bear, she said

Heroic: After coming face-to-face with the 25-pound springer spaniel, the bear took off into the woods, she said

'I guess nobody heard me,' she said. 'After I realized nobody was coming, I stopped screaming, and it started dragging me to the ditch.'

Then she remembered something she had been taught at school.

'In school they teach you to play dead. I just did that, and it worked,' she told ABC News. 'It stopped biting me as soon as I stopped screaming.'

Then it was up to Ralph to finish off the job. The 25-pound dog started yapping and lunching at the bear, which Leah believes scared the bear away.

The creature walked backwards, fell into a ditch and then walked off.

Unsure whether or not it was coming back, she continued to play dead but eventually managed to make her way to her father's house. Her parents called 911. 

Recovering: Leah, pictured before the attack, sustained deep bites and gouges to her legs, back, neck and face and needed hundreds of stitches after the incident, but she is now back home with her family

Scene: Investigators can be seen the scene of the attack. The Wildlife Commission went on to kill the bear

Her mother Sheri Mann told the Apalach Times: 'It bit her face open, and beside her ear on her scalp. It was very, very bad. Even as I sit here now, I can't believe it happened.' 

Leah has undergone hours of surgery and has hundreds of stitches for the wounds to her neck, head, back and arms - but she was back home for Christmas.

'She managed to crack a few smiles at me before she went in for surgery,' Mann told WMBB. 

On Thursday, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said it shot a bear that they believe attacked Leah after using dogs to track scent left on her clothes. 

It was the third bear attack in the region this year.
