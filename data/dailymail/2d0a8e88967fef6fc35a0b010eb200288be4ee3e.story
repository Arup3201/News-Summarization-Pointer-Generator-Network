For someone whose efforts were so crucial to the Allied victory in the Second World War, it’s surprising how little is known about him.

But new research has revealed how unsung hero Colonel Thomas Kendrick was the top MI6 officer at the centre of Britain's intelligence work - and helped save tens of thousands of lives.

Colonel Kendrick led an extraordinary operation of spying on German prisoners of war by listening in on their conversations with cellmates from 1942 at Latimer House near Chesham, Buckinghamshire.

Latimer House was one of three secret 
intelligence sites run by Colonel Kendrick, with 1,000 staff employed 
and 10,000 prisoners conversations’ bugged across all of them.

Some
 of the important conversations first overheard in 1943 regarded Adolf 
Hitler’s secret missiles, the V1, V2 and V3, which saw Winston Churchill
 order their development sites to be bombed.

Historian
 Helen Fry - who has profiled Colonel Kendrick in her new book - said 
that without this, the Allies could not have carried out the crucial 
D-Day invasion of Normandy, France, on June 6, 1944.

Dr
 Fry told MailOnline: ‘The listeners first heard of the secret weapons. 
So, as a direct result, Churchill gave the order to bomb Peenemünde in 
Germany.

‘Without that it’s 
believed we wouldn’t have been able to do the D-Day landings. Hitler was
 planning to fire 300 a day on London. We’re talking about highly 
sophisticated stuff.’

Highest-ranking prisoners: Some of the 59 German generals held at Trent Park near Cockfosters, north London - one of the two other sites used by Kendrick's men. The third was Wilton Park, near Beaconsfield

She added: ‘Without bombing the development sites, we would have lost the war - there was no real defence, especially against the V2 and V3.

'If the V1 and V2 development hadn't been delayed in 1943, we couldn't have mounted the D-Day landings without a military disaster. In that sense, Kendrick's unit was pivotal for the downfall of Hitler.'

The first V1 missles were eventually launched against London on June 13, 1944, a week after D-Day. They were pilotless, jet-propelled planes that flew by air-driven gyroscope and magnetic compass.

Colonel Kendrick had previously been spying for Britain at the heart of Europe’s espionage hub in in Vienna, Austria, where he helped save up to 200 Jews a day between March and August 1938.

But he was then denounced by a double agent to Hitler’s Secret Service and was arrested by the Gestapo. However, after four days of interrogations he was released and returned to England.

Dr Fry said: ‘He then completely disappears, but behind the scenes he’s working for M16 head office. Kendrick is tasked with getting ready a unit to bug prisoners of war as soon as war breaks out.

‘You have the prisoners who have all this knowledge in their head, but are not necessarily going to give it out in interrogation. Kendrick has three sites - he started in the Tower of London.

‘Then he moved out to Trent Park near Cockfosters. He then took over Latimer House, but the prisoners were only there for two or three days. The third place was Wilton Park, near Beaconsfield.’

She said that the prisoners would be bugged from ‘when they woke up in the morning to when they went to sleep’, adding: ‘The impact of this on the war is hugely significant and underrated.’

Churchill was a big fan of the work being done at Latimer House - he ‘loved the fact that we could understand the mind-set of the enemy’ and would regularly travel the 30 miles from London to visit.

Dr Fry said: ‘In the early days Kendrick had British-born male listeners – they didn’t want the women to listen to coarse language.

'You have the prisoners who have all this knowledge in their head, but are not necessarily going to give it out in interrogation'

Dr Helen Fry, historian

‘They were always fluent German speakers, but the problem they found by 1942 was the dialect was very difficult to understand. They then decided to draft in German-speaking refugees.

‘We bugged the conservations of 10,000 prisoners. There were close to half a million prisoners, but not all would have been significant enough to have the treatment.’

Dr Fry, who is originally from Devon but now lives in Golders Green, north-west London, is hosting a book launch for ‘Spymaster: The Secret Life of Kendrick’ on August 26 at 3pm at Latimer House.
