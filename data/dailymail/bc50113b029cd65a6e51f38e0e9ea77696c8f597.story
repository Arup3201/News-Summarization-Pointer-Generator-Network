Attack: James Greenall's victim was left in a wheelchair after she jumped 12ft from an upstairs window to escape the attack

A thug who wrapped wire around the necks of a mother and her three-year-old son during a terrifying violent attack has been jailed for three years.

The victim of James Greenall, 21, was left wheelchair-bound from the injuries sustained after she jumped 12ft from an upstairs window to escape from the attack in which she thought she was going to be killed.

Greenall repeatedly kicked and punched the mother during the sustained attack at her home in Bramley, Leeds, and then wrapped a TV cable around her neck and pulled it tight as she cowered on her bed with her three-year-old child.

Leeds Crown Court heard the wire had also got wrapped around the child's neck during the attack.

Greenall broke the woman's arm during his relentless barrage and when she showed him how badly she was injured, he simply retorted 'I don't care'.

He did momentarily halt the attack, but only to tell his terrified victim that she had five seconds to put her child back to bed before making the chilling threat that he was going to kill her.

Gerald Hendron, prosecuting, said that the victim believed she was about to be killed and jumped from an upstairs window to escape the clutches of her attacker - leaving her having to spend time in a wheelchair due to her injuries.

Despite suffering fractures to both heels and a spinal injury as a result of the jump she still managed to reach a neighbour's house and they called the emergency services.

The woman, who was seven years older than Greenall, also suffered a fractured arm, fractured hand, two black eyes and was left with a footprint on her face from where Greenall had stamped on her.

Greenall was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to GBH with intent.
