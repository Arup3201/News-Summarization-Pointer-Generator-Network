The grieving husband of Doctor Who actress Mary Tamm died while writing thank-you messages to well-wishers hours after  delivering a eulogy at her funeral.

Marcus Ringrose, 60, collapsed while he was sitting at his computer at the home he had shared with  his wife.

Miss Tamm, 62, was best known for playing Doctor Who’s companion Romana alongside Tom Baker in the 1978 series. She died last month after an 18-month battle with cancer.

Last night the actress’s daughter Lauren Burlingham, 32, spoke of her devastation at losing her father so soon after her mother.

‘My father was an exceptional man in 
his own right,’ she said. ‘He was a rare individual who brought a lot of
 joy, humour and sound advice into people’s lives.

‘He was devoted to caring for my mother and he loved spending time with his grandson.’

Speaking from her parents’ home in 
Battersea, south-west London, Mrs Burlingham added: ‘He was a 
well-respected and influential man in the City where he worked as a 
chief loss adjuster.’

Miss Tamm’s agent, Barry Langford, 
said: ‘If you can die of a broken heart, then he did. Marcus looked 
after her through her illness. He was desperately worried about her and 
was devastated by her death.’

Yesterday the coroner told Mrs 
Burlingham the exact cause of her father’s death on Tuesday could not be
 established, but said there was nothing suspicious to it.

The couple had been married for 34 
years and leave behind a seven-year-old grandson, Max, as well as their 
daughter. They met when Mr Ringrose visited the BBC, saw Miss Tamm and 
told a friend: ‘I’m going to marry that girl.’

He engineered a meeting by taking a hairbrush from her handbag and then, having obtained her number, rang her to say he had it.

Mr Langford said Miss Tamm called him a ‘cheeky bugger’ but agreed to meet him.

In a tribute to his wife – whose  
parents came from Estonia – after her death on July 26, Mr Ringrose 
said: ‘Mary was truly beautiful in every way. She was a very spiritual 
lady who loved nature and adored all animals.

Leading lady: Mary was the first incarnation of the Doctor's companion Romana

'On set and off stage, her 
earthy northern humour and self-deprecating wit brightened every 
occasion. She was a consummate actress, and immensely popular in the 
profession.

‘Mary was born in Bradford, the 
daughter of impoverished refugees, and through sheer talent and hard 
graft got herself to Rada, starred opposite Jon Voight in The Odessa 
File, and found a form of immortality as the Time Lady Romana opposite 
Tom Baker in Doctor Who. We will miss her every day.’

Although she left Doctor Who after one
 season, Miss Tamm had recently reprised the part of Romana in a series 
of audio episodes recorded with Baker.

On television she was also in Brookside, EastEnders, Wire In The Blood, Paradise Heights and Jonathan Creek.
