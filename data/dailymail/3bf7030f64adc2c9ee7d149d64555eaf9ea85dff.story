Hallmark has joined other mainstream brands and debuted its first ad featuring a same-sex couple as a part of its new series of Valentine's Day videos.

The greeting card giant enlisted real-life lesbian couple of two years, Eugenia and Corinna, for its Put Your Heart to Paper campaign, which asks romantic partners to describe their feelings for each other without using the word 'love'. 

For the series of clips, real couples were filmed as they shared touching stories about their significant others and their relationships.

In the video featuring Eugenia and Corinna, both women recalled the attention-grabbing outfit Eugenia had worn on their first date.

'I think I was wearing the worst outfit that I could ever wear,' Eugenia admitted, later explaining. 'I wear like every possible item in my closet if I am really nervous.'

Corinna noted: 'I wasn't sure about her when we first met because she was wearing these bright, shiny purple pants and three different shirts.'

But during their first meeting, Eugenia said she started 'laughing really hard' and when she looked over, she noticed that Corinna was laughing too.

'I was like, "Oh this absolutely perfect."' she said.

When asked how often they say 'I love you', Corinna explained that it often comes out 'in every day moments'.

Eugenia added: 'I think its like an every day thing or at least before you go to bed you're like: "Hey hun, I love you."'

After completing their separate interviews, the two women were reunited to watch what they had said about each other.

While Corinna said that Eugenia is 'inspiring' and 'brings optimism' to her life, Eugenia described her feelings for Corinna as 'warm fuzzies eating chocolate chip cookies all the time.'

'She means so many things to me,' Corinna said. 'She means being excited for the future and the right now.' 

After watching the heartwarming video, one online commenter wrote: 'Well done. Glad to see hallmark taking a brave stand for a wider scope of love in our many faceted society. Bravo!'

Another added: 'This makes me so very happy and proud to be a Hallmark employee, who is also gay, and who has been pushing our idea of expanded love identities forward for a long time. My heart is bursting, my eyes are spilling. Thank you for sharing your story with us, and your love with each other.'

Hallmark is the latest big-name company to feature a same-sex couple in its advertising. 

Earlier this month iconic jewelry giant Tiffany & Co. released its first ad starring two gay men who are also dating in real life.

And last year, makers of Honey Maid graham crackers featured two gay dads and their children in its commercial celebrating all families.

After receiving some backlash, the company released another commercial in which two artists printed out the negative comments and turned them into a piece of art that spells out 'Love'. 

Honey Maid noted in the ad that it had received 10 times more positives responses than negative ones.   

The movement towards inclusive advertising is nothing new. Major retailers, including J. Crew, Gap and Banana Republic have also used same-sex couples in advertising campaigns over the past couple of years. 

Although Hallmark has been making marriage cards for same-sex couples since 2008, this is the first time the brand has featured one in advertising. 

Despite its best intentions, the brand faced scrutiny in 2013 after it replaced the word 'gay' with 'fun' on an ornament featuring a popular lyric from the Christmas song 'Deck the Halls'.

Hallmark later issued an apology, saying: 'We never intend to offend or make political statements with our products and in hindsight, we realize we shouldn't have changed the lyrics on the ornament.'
