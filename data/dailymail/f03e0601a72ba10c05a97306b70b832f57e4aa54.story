Former Scunthorpe manager Russ Wilcox is in talks over taking over at York City.

Wilcox was sacked last week and replaced by Mark Robins. The 50-year-old had led the club to promotion from League Two last season and in doing so beat the record for the longest unbeaten run at the beginning of a managerial reign, as they went 28 matches without defeat.

Nigel Worthington resigned as York manager on Monday. James Beattie, Micky Adams, Csaba Laszlo and Nolberto Solano have also shown an interest in the post.

Robins became the new manager of Scunthorpe after Wilcox's sacking on Wednesday. It is the 44-year-old's first managerial post since leaving Huddersfield just one game into the new season.

Robins signed a three-year deal and immediately revealed to a press conference on Monday that he was eager to get stuck in to his new challenge.
