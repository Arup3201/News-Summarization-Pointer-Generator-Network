The vehicles are undoubtedly different and many of the clothes might look a little out of place in 21st century Europe, but the locations are much the same and many of the buildings remain unchanged.

A collection of photos made up of two different shots of the same scene taken decades apart offers a fascinating look at how fashion, transport and architecture has changed in Hungary's picturesque capital Budapest over the decades.

Hungarian photographer Kerenyi Zoltan turned his camera into a time machine by taking archive pictures of various landmarks around the beautiful city taken throughout the 1990s and superimposing them on his own modern day shots.

Then and now: A pair of friends from 1960 and a modern couple appear to share the viewing platform at Gellert Hill in Budapest to look out over the city's Liberty Bridge

Modern meets nostalgia: A picture of a tram wreck in Louise Blaha square from 1956 is set against a 2013 picture of the same site. The McDonald's would undoubtedly not have been there when the crash happened

She's in fashion: A swimmer from 1971 frolics in the water at the famous Hotel Gellert in Budapest next to sunseekers from 2011

Clever: Kerenyi Zoltan's picture makes it look as though these two men from 1962 are looking back at the man behind them in the fairground ride carriage in 2012

He spent hours painstakingly putting more than 300 pictures together, ensuring that each scene matches perfectly.

Kerenyi used pictures from photo archiving site Fortepan to complete the collection, which he calls Ablak a Múltra, or Windows To The Past.

The images took him around two years to put together and his work received worldwide acclaim when his images recently went viral on Reddit.

He decided to put Windows To The Past together after developing a keen interest in old snapshots of the city.

Window to the Past: Liberty Bridge and the Aero Express Co. seaplane station is pictured in 1927 and 2013

Contrast: Budapest city park looks busier in 1969 as it hosts a car show than it does in 2013

Permanent fixture: The city's iconic Chain Bridge pictured lit up at night in 1938 and 2013

Now deserted: The Ferenc Puskas Stadium is packed out for an event in 1953 but sits deserted in the 2012 picture

The stunning images not only highlight the similarities and differences of Budapest's past and present, but the juxtaposition of the photos offers a nostalgic look at bygone days by placing residents and tourists from decades past in a modern setting.

The collection sees 1960 meet 2013 at the Gellert Hill lookout over Budapest's Liberty Bridge.

The cleverly done shot makes it look as if a couple from the modern day are looking out over the same scene as a pair of friends from more than half a century ago.

Down to earth city: It may look like Budapest is being invaded in this 1980 picture of people parachuting close to the Danube, but the sky is a lot clearer in the 2011 shot

Picturesque: The Hungarian Parliament Building is pictured back in 1976 and later in 2012

Generation gap: The difference between fashions and even the prams in use is clear inthese images of central Budapest from 1972 and 2013

War and peace: Astoria junction, opposite the Museum of Kossuth Lajos is pictured with a tank on the road in 1956 and later in 2012

Another seamlessly contrasted image highlights the difference in fashions between 1900 and 2013.

A Victorian couple are pictured walking alongside the Hungarian National Museum, wearing traditional costume while those seemingly walking around them are wearing modern clothing.

The difference between 20th and 21st century Hungary is perhaps best illustrated by a picture of a tram crashed in Louise Blaha Square in 1956 set against the same square today.

Though the picture shows that the public transport system hasn't changed much, one of Budapest's beautiful buildings captured in the background of the shot is now occupied by a McDonald's.

New build: A glass fronted building that by 2012 has been built on the site of this old shop can be seen peeking over the top of the 1980 image

Landing site: An Mi-6 Soviet helicopter is pictured in central Budapest in 1966. The same area is pictured being used as a car park in 2013
