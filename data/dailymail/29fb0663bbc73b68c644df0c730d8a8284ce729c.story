Yemeni rebels have seized the country's presidential palace and attacked the US-backed leader's official residence in what is being described by one top military leader as a 'coup'.

President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi was inside his official residence as it came under 'heavy shelling' for half-an-hour on Tuesday. 

At the same time, the powerful Shiite Houthi rebels seized the presidential palace in the capital, Sanaa, looting the arms depot in the grounds.

Hadi was unharmed in the attack, which came five months after the rebels first swept into Sanaa. 

Colonel Saleh al-Jamalani, the commander of the Presidential Protection Force that guards the palace, said: 'This is a coup. There is no other word to describe what is happening but a coup.'

The Houthi rebels took control of the capital back in September, and analysts say they are now 'finishing what they started'

Colonel al-Jamalani added the rebels were most likely helped by insiders. 

The attack came after apparently unsuccessful talks between the two sides at Haidi's official residence that morning - a day after violence tore through the city.

It is understood the meeting was to discuss the release of Ahmed bin Mubarak - the president's top aide, kidnapped after Hadi allegedly breached a UN-brokered peace deal.

In return for his release, the Houthis were asking for changes in constitution and national authority.

On Monday, the Houthis had seized control of state media in Sanaa, clashing with soldiers near the presidential palace.

The Houthis and Hadi's forces have blamed each other for the outbreak of violence, which left at least nine people dead and 67 wounded, Yemen's deputy health minister Nasser Baoum said.

On Tuesday, Houthi fighters were on the streets, travelling in pickup trucks mounted with anti-aircraft guns, while manning checkpoints across the capital - including near the prime minister's residence and the intelligence headquarters.

Information Minister Nadia al-Sakkaf posted on her Twitter account that the shelling started at 3pm local time 'by armed forces positioned over rooftops facing' the president's house.

Yemeni analysts say the attacks - which have long been expected - are only the Houthis 'finishing the job' they began in September.

Abdel-Bari Taher, a veteran Yemeni journalist and writer, said: 'What is happening now is just one more step toward (the Houthis') consolidation of power.' 

But the Houthis' television network al-Masseria claimed the attack came after rebels intercepted and foiled attempts by an unspecified group to loot weapons from the presidential palace.

In New York, the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting over the chaos in Sanaa. 

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed concern over the 'deteriorating situation' in Yemen and urged all sides to cease hostilities.

According to CNN, two U.S. navy warships moved  into the area to help evacuate Americans from the embassy if needs be.

The weakening of Hadi, a top US ally, also undermines efforts by America and its allies to battle al-Qaida's Yemeni affiliate, Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, which claimed responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo massacre earlier this month.

Dr Charles Schmitz, a specialist in Yemen, doesn't think a change of government should have too big an impact on American efforts in the country.

'The Houthi portray themselves as "authentically" Yemeni,' he explained. 'They criticise the government for being beholden to foreigners.

'On the other hand, they have done absolutely to offend the Americans, and the embassy is keeping its doors open to any future ruling party.' 

However, more worrying is if the Houthi - whose traditional stronghold is in the north - decide to expand out of the capital into east Yemen, where Sunni tribesmen dominate.

If that were to happen, Dr Schmitz warns, a 'bloody civil war' would most likely ensue.

Others feel Al-Qaida in Yemen, which has waged deadly attacks targeting both the Houthis and Hadi's forces, stands to benefit.

The Houthis are also seen by their critics as a proxy of Shiite Iran and are believed to be allied with former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who ruled Yemen for more than three decades before he was ousted in 2012 after Arab Spring protests. The rebels deny any Iran links.

Suspected al-Qaida militants on Tuesday tried to assassinate a top army commander in the southern Hadramawt province, killing five of his guards in the attack, military officials said.

The militants set off explosives, hurling them at the commander's convoy, then opened gunfire but the commander managed to escape unharmed, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media.
