This is the heartbreaking moment that an orphaned baby elephant mourns the death of her mother after she was killed for her ivory tusks by a poacher's poisoned spear.

In the footage, the traumatised animal, named Roi, is seen standing over her mother's dead body following the brutal raid.

Just 24 hours earlier, the endangered animals had been photographed playing happily together in Kenya's Masai Mara National Park.

This is the heartbreaking moment than an orphaned baby elephant mourns the death of her mother after she was killed by a poacher's poisoned spear for her ivory tusks

The 10-month-old orphan temporarily joined another herd, but faced starvation without her own mother's milk.

Luckily, Roi was later taken to safety after a dramatic rescue by wildlife experts. 

During the complex operation, the youngster was manoeuvred away from the herd, tranquillised and put on a plane. 

Roi was then taken to The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust Elephant Orphanage in Nairobi National Park, where trained keepers are now caring for her.

Rob Brandford, UK Director of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, said: 'Roi arrived in good health but was clearly traumatised from witnessing the death of her mother.

'She took milk from the keepers early but was wary and understandably a little nervous around her new surroundings, not trusting the keepers. Once she met the other orphans, she was immediately comfortable and content.

This is the rescue operation which took place after Roi was left orphaned following her mother's death 

'The older elephants paid her attention and provided her with the love and affection she craved and missed.

'As the days have passed little Roi has settled in completely and is now extremely attached to her keepers, familiar with the routine and is playing once more - she is a confident little elephant.'

Ivory poaching is a huge problem in Africa, killing one elephant every 15 minutes.

The David Sheldrick Wilfdlife Trust is hoping to raise £15,000 to save more baby elephants like Roi who are orphaned by poaching.

Roi was soon taken to The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust Elephant Orphanage in Nairobi National Park, where trained keepers are now caring for her

Mr Brandford said: 'Arriving as a fragile baby, Roi would not have survived without our intervention and she has now been afforded a second chance.

'We have 82 infant elephants reliant on us right now and we need to be ready to provide the same life-saving care for other orphaned elephants in need.'

Now at the orphanage, she joins dozens of other orphaned elephants who are also living with their new family

Roi, pictured, is said to have become very attached to her keepers at her new home and was described as a 'confident little elephant'
