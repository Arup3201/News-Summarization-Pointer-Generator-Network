A Wyoming man rang in his 100th birthday at the car dealership where he still works today, 66 years after making his first sale.

As long as he can get out of the house, Derrell Alexander said that he'll be showing up for the job he loves at White's Mountain Motors in Casper.

And although Alexander leaves his shift at the dealership a little earlier nowadays, he still works six days a week.

Alexander made his first car sale 66 years ago. He still works six days a week and hasn't taken a vacation since his two children were young 

Alexander believes you don't last long if 'you sit around the house and watch TV,' he told the Casper Journal. 

The father-of-two hasn't even taken a vacation since his children were young. 

But his daughter Sheri Rupe said she believes work has 'kept him going.' 

'He'd probably be gone by now if he went home and sat down and did nothing,' said Rupe who, unlike her father, is happily retired. 

Tom Rupe believes his father-in-law will be selling cars and sitting at his favorite spot in the dealership, right by the fireplace, until the day he dies. 

'I think what he wants is to be sitting there in front of that fireplace and have it be his last day,' Rupe told KCWY 13.

Once a top salesman, Alexander now sells to the children and grandchildren of his old regular customers

Alexander worked on ranches, a pipeline and as a mechanic before finding his dream job in car sales in 1949.

Alexander, who has worked his whole life, said he has no hobbies and hopes he never has to retire. 

Brad Follensbee, White's Mountain Motors' general manager, said Alexander's drive is an inspiration to everyone at the dealership.

'I think it gives him purpose and drive,' said Follensbee. 'To get up every morning and get ready and come to work and be here.'
