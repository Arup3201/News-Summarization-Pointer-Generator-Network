A serial bride who has tied the knot eight times has found love again after TV presenter Eamonn Holmes told her never to stop looking for her perfect man.

Wedding addict Sandra, 56, dubbed Scotland's answer to Liz Taylor, joined a singles website after being encouraged to look for love again by Eamonn.

The presenter told Sandra not to give up when she appeared as a guest on This Morning last year and flirted with him on air.

Mr. Right: Sandra McNab, who has tied the knot eight times, has finally found love with Alex McNicol, who she met online

Inspired Sandra set up a profile on the Zoosk dating site and was inundated with hundreds of messages from potential love interests.

And she was left lovestruck after agreeing to meet new man Alex McNicol, 54, who had seen her profile and wooed her over the internet.

Sandra, of Clydebank, said: 'After my last marriage, I never thought I'd ever love again.

'But after taking some time out I felt I was ready to believe in love again.

'After appearing on This Morning, Eamonn took me aside and told me not to give up.

Advice: Sandra was encouraged by TV presenter Eamonn Holmes to join an online dating site, she was then inundated with interest from men

Wise words: Eamonn Holmes told her never to stop looking for her perfect man on ITV's This Morning so she took it upon herself to continue her search for Mr. Right online

'So I decided to set up a profile and join Zoosk. I was honest with myself and wrote that I was looking to meet someone who was kind and trustworthy.

'I've always been known for having my make-up on, my blonde hair and for being a bit glam. But this time I uploaded a picture of myself looking much more natural, without my hair done and make up on.

'I wanted people to see me for who I really was and within hours I had over 400 messages.

'But Alex was the first to send me a little teddy bear as a present online and I thought it was really sweet,' she said.

Sandra, who joined the dating site in April this year, met up with haulage contractor Alex, from Larkhall, Lanarkshire, days later at Cameron House at Loch Lomond.

Better together: Sandra, who has walked down the aisle eight times with seven different men in 40 years, has finally found love with Alex, who doesn't mind about her previous marriages

But Sandra, who has walked down the 
aisle eight times with seven different men in 40 years, admitted she was
a bag of nerves as she had never been on an actual first date.

She
said: 'I have made it through many weddings but this was my first real 
date and my hand was shaking uncontrollably as I tried to put my mascara
on.

'I hadn't told 
Alex of my previous marriages until this point as I'd wanted to tell him
face-to-face. So I just announced that I had eight divorces behind me 
and then added "but only seven husbands."

Young love: Mother-of three Sandra first said 'I do' to spray painter Joseph Mullen at age 16 in October 1973, with whom she had three children, Debbie, Gillian and Kenneth

'He took it well and said he didn't 
care if I'd been married 15 times. I let out a deep sigh of relief when 
he didn't choke on his steak and run.'

Within weeks, the smitten pair were enjoying candle-lit dinners and weekends away together.

Sandra insists she is taking things more slowly this time although she has not ruled out walking down the aisle again in the future.

She added: 'I thought romance was dead but Alex has treated me like a real woman should be treated.

Clubbers: Husband number three was factory worker Andy Smith, 49, who she met in a Clydebank nightclub

Number three: Sandra's third husband, Andy Smith, pictured with her mother

'He whisked me away on a romantic break a week after our first date. With us, it isn't about rushing or sex.

'There isn't any pressure, it's about being together and for once properly getting to know each other.

'But we get on really well and are very comfortable together, so you never know what the future holds.'

Alex
added: 'I met Sandra online and we just clicked. We are just enjoying 
each others company and we're really happy. We'll just see how it goes.

'Sandra
told me on our first date she had been married before but I don't care 
how many times she's been married. The past is the past and it's time to
look forward.'

Toyboy: Sandra then got hitched to younger lover Alex Mullen, 43, 11 years her junior

Deja vu: The unlucky-in-love grandma next wed George Pollock, 46, twice as husband number five and seven

Repeat of history: Wedding-addict Sandra, dubbed Scotland's answer to Liz Taylor, remarried George Pollock as her seventh husband

Mother-of three Sandra first said 'I do' to spray painter Joseph Mullen at age 16 in October 1973, with whom she had three children, Debbie, Gillian and Kenneth.

The next up the aisle was taxi driver Richard Kearney, who Sandra wed after he collected her at her home as his fare.

Number three was factory worker Andy Smith, 49, who she met in a Clydebank nightclub.

Sandra's fourth husband was Patrick Wright, 62, who she met in a social club in 1991. They wed a year later.

The unlucky-in-love grandma next wed George Pollock, 46, twice as husband number five and seven.

Sandra then got hitched to toy-boy love Alex Mullen, 43, 11 years her junior.
