Police have now confirmed that the gun Donald Holland used to kill himself on June 1 belonged to his niece, the missing Alabama teen Brittney Wood who was last seen with her uncle.

Ms Wood disappeared on May 30 after she was seen heading to Baldwin County by the Styx River area in her uncle's car.

The mystery surrounding her disappearance has been overshadowed, family members say, by the arrest of several of her family members for sex abuse charges, including her brother, Derek Wood, 21.

Weapon: Officials said he used Ms Wood's Raven .25-caliber handgun revolver

Holland shot himself just half an hour before he was scheduled to meet with investigators about the teen's disappearance.

Officials said he used Ms Wood's Raven .25-caliber handgun revolver.

'It just really does not look good that she went missing May 30 and two days later he commits suicide,' Ms Wood's mother, Chessie Wood said to Fox.

The family told Fox that normally, Ms Wood kept just two bullets in her weapon. Police confirmed that after Holland fired, there was just one left.

'I mean, I just want an answer. That’s all I want. I want to bring her home whether it be tragically or a happy ending,' Mrs Wood said.

Relatives are hoping that a $1,500 reward will help them find closure to the case.

'We believe we have missed something that is hollering our name, and maybe it was so obvious,' said Mrs Wood.

At first, some relatives thought Brittney may have skipped town.

'We as a family do not see how she 
had the means to run. We’ve covered every friend, every one of them are 
accounted for,' Mrs Woods said.

'I mean if she had to run because she's that scared, I would really believe that she would have [taken] her daughter with her.'

'It just really does not look good that she went missing May 30 and two days later he commits suicide.'

Brittney’ mother, Chessie Wood, told WKRG that Derek and Brittney were extremely close.

She told the network: 'They have the same friends, run the same places, I mean they're like this. He is Brittney's protector and he feels like he wasn't there when he should've been.'

Derek Wood, 21, was charged with abuse after her disappearance, according to the Baldwin County Sheriff's Office.

In a statement posted on The Hometown Search for Brittney Wood Facebook page her father and stepmother, Wallace & Stephanie Hanke said: 'In the wake of the recent arrest our focus is still the same as it's been from the beginning (sic).

'Our goal is to bring Brittney home. Thanks for the continued support of family & friends.'

Derek Wood, who is listed on the office’s website as homeless, is being held on $25,000 bond.

Also in the weeks since Ms Wood vanished, two more of her uncles were arrested, but the arrests are not believed to be connected to the teen's case.

Both of the uncles, Dustin Kent, 32, and Randall Wood, 42, have since been released on bond.

Brittney Wood is described as 5'1" and 105 pounds, with dirty blonde hair and blue eyes.
