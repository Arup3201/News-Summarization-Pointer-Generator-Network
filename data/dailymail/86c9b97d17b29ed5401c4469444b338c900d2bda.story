Millions of viewers watched David Beckham sign a football for a young fan during Sport Relief's Only Fools And Horses sketch on Friday evening.

But while they will have undoubtedly recognised the superstar, most will have been unaware that the six-year-old boy was actually the grandson of the show's creator, John Sullivan.

Joe Sullivan was filmed asking Beckham for an autograph in a market in the sketch - before holding up a football for him to sign.

Star: Joe Sullivan, who appeared in the Only Fools And Horses sketch, is the grandson of the show's creator

Touching moment: David Beckham sign a football for six-year-old Joe during the special Sport Relief sketch

Talented: Joe's grandfather, John Sullivan, created the famous British sitcom, but passed away three years ago

The schoolboy's grandfather, who created and wrote the famous British sitcom, passed away in 2011.

Today, his family said they thought it would be a fitting tribute to feature Joe in the sketch, which helped Sport Relief raise a record £51million for charity.

Dan Sullivan, Joe’s father, told the Sunday Express: 'My brother Jim and I put the sketch together and Jim thought it would be nice to include Joe in it.

'We agreed that if dad had been here to write it he would probably have tried to include one of his grandchildren in it.'

Appearance: Beckham delighted fans after recreating Del Boy's famous bar fall in the special Sport Relief show

Falling: The superstar topples over while speaking to Joe, who appeared in a tribute to his late grandfather

Smooth: In the original skit (pictured) Del Boy is heard telling pal Trigger: 'Play it nice and cool son, nice and cool. You know what I mean', before falling through a bar

Mr Sullivan said his son had been 'very nervous' before filming - adding that he had relaxed after meeting 38-year-old Beckham, who wore a cap and thick-rimmed glasses in the episode.

'David really put him at ease,' he said. 'David’s got children of his own and he’s got a really nice manner and is very natural and down to earth.

'Joe did really well. We are very proud of him and I am sure my dad would have been too.'

Not them this time! Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst, who plays Rodney, are seen looking on from their market stall as Beckham lands on the ground

Golden Balls: Earlier in the scene Del Boy and Rodney are seen attempting to sell the star's signed 'boxer briefs' on their market stall, with the latter failing miserably at modelling the white undergarments

During the sketch, Del Boy and Rodney are seen 
attempting to sell Beckham's signed 'boxer briefs' on their market 
stall, with the latter failing miserably at 
modelling the white undergarments.

The superstar is later seen sitting with them at their local 
cafe after dismal sales, before offering Rodney, played by Nicholas 
Lyndhurst, some modelling advice.

David is heard telling him: 'Most people think modelling is about 
standing there looking great, but there's more to it than that. Just 
remember a good model doesn't just walk, he glides. They don't just 
turn, they oscillate.'

Great reception: Viewers took to Twitter to share their delight during the BBC1 show, with one writing: 'David Beckham's fall on Only Fools and Horses was almost as funny as the original. Totally didn't expect it either'

As Rodney gives it 
another go, Beckham is seen watching from afar, and, after signing the football for Joe, he goes to lean on a nearby crate before falling to 
the floor in the exactly the same way as David Jason did in the series.

Viewers
 took to Twitter to share their delight during the BBC1 show, with one 
writing: 'David Beckham's fall on Only Fools and Horses was almost as 
funny as the original. Totally didn't expect it either 
#BeckhamInPeckham.'

One fan
 commented: 'Was not expecting that classic fall #DavidBeckham in #OFAH 
ha ha great', while another added: 'Only fool and horses with David 
Beckham. It was as good as I hoped it would be. Becks got to do the 
classic fall.'

Take two: After some 'helpful' advice from Beckham, Rodney gives modelling a second go before the famous fall happens

Guest star: The retired footballer appeared in the Sport Relief sketch wearing a cap and thick-rimmed glasses

The episode also saw the actors 
jokingly poke fun at David's intelligence, and at one point he is heard 
telling them the reason why he is wearing dark-rimmed specs.

'I'm trying to go incognitive', he said, while meaning incognito.

The memorable piece ended with a tribute to the late Roger 'Trigger' Lloyd Pack, who died aged 69 in January this year, as well as a tribute to Mr Sullivan.
