King Albert of Belgium abdicated earlier today after a 20-year reign, clearing the way for his son, Philippe, to take over as this fractured nation's seventh king later in the day.

The 79-year-old signed away his rights as the kingdom's largely ceremonial ruler at the Royal Palace in the presence of Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo, who holds the political power in this 183-year-old parliamentary democracy.

The country then got a new king as Prince Philippe, 53, took the oath before the nation's legislators at the Parliament building a short walk across the Royal Park in the heart of the city.

End of an era: Throngs of people lined the streets eager to catch a glimpse of the much-loved monarch King Albert, pictured here with his wife Queen Paola

The outgoing king said: 'Belgium is modernizing itself and it gives me joy.'

He then called for continued cohesion between the nation's 6 million Dutch-speaking Flemings and 4.5 million French-speakers.

The former King took the unusual decision to abdicate just three weeks ago on health grounds.

Under crystal chandeliers in a gilded hall at the Royal Palace, Di Rupo called Albert 'a great head of state'.

He added: 'You are closing an important page in the history of our country.'

Earlier
 both Albert and Philippe mingled with the crowds under a royal blue sky
 following a Catholic ceremony at the Cathedral of St Michael and Saint 
Gudula that set off the festivities.

King Albert announced his abdication 
plans less than three weeks ago, so there was little time to turn the 
occasion into a huge international event.

No foreign royals were at the 
ceremony. Since the royal transition coincides with Belgium's national 
day celebrations, a military parade had already been planned.

Wellwishers: Crowds of people gather at Place du Jeu de Balle to pay tribute to popular King Albert, who has reigned for 20 years. Those at the back were able to watch on big screens

Colour: The scene around the abdication was awash with red, yellow and black, the colours of the Belgium flag

Packed: The public gathered in the streets of Brussels in droves to catch a glimpse of their popular royal family

Philippe will face a tough task in 
the coming months. The fractious nation, divided by language, holds 
parliamentary elections in June 2014 amid calls for even more autonomy 
for the language groups.

After the last elections in 2010, it 
took a record 541 days before a government could be formed amid 
bickering about how much more power should be sapped from the central 
state to profit the separate language groups.

Unlike his five predecessors, King 
Albert tried to avoid politics as much as possible and his successor is 
expected to do the same.

Prince Philippe has been groomed for the job as a leader of foreign trade delegations over the past two decades. 'He
 is a very wise person, a person who is very well prepared,' said EU 
Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, who attended the ceremony.

'He knows the politics of Belgium and Europe very well.'
