A 10-year-old boy needed extensive plastic surgery after being left with horrific facial injuries when a jet ski crashed into his head.

Daniel Clamens was enjoying a banana boat ride with his friend on Al Mamzar boat beach in Dubai when the pair were thrown into the sea.

The jet ski, which was allegedly being ridden by an off-duty policeman, crashed into the child's face before continuing its journey.

Struck: Daniel Clamens, aged 10 at the time of the incident, was struck in the face by a jet ski after falling into the water on Dubai's Al Mamzar beach, pictured, in 2011

Arrests: Sharjah Police arrested a 23-year-old Emirati policeman from Dubai and his cousin with a jet ski attached to their Nissan Patrol - they have been charged with mistakenly injuring the child (stock image)

The child, who was aged 10 when the incident occurred in June 2011, was left with a 15cm scar across his head and fractures to his cheek and eye socket.

Daniel was only saved when his 13-year-old neighbour Peter, who he was on the boat ride with, turned him over and dragged him back to the boat.

A family friend, known as JP, who was driving the boat then lifted the heavily bleeding child out of the water before calling an ambulance.

The jet ski rider is understood to have sped off, before briefly returning.

JP said: 'He raised his hands and covered his face in a 
gesture indicating that a grave mishap had happened.'

The jet skier then left once more before the ambulance arrived.

Daniel was in Dubai with his father Roberto, a commercial pilot, older brother Bryan and his mother.

Sharjah Police arrested a 
23-year-old Emirati policeman from Dubai and his cousin as they headed
 towards the emirate with a jet ski attached to their Nissan Patrol.

Injuries: The child was rushed to Rashid Hospital's  Intensive Care Unit after the incident, in which he was left with a 15cm scar across his head and fractures to his cheek and eye socket

They were both charged with 
mistakenly injuring the child and with violating regulations governing 
sea vessels by not registering the jet ski.

After the incident, Daniel was rushed to Rashid Hospital's Intensive Care Unit  
where the wound on the left side of his face was treated and a metal plate was inserted into his face.

After surgery he was unable to close his left eye and could only open his mouth minimally.

He was flown back to the US where he was treated at Miami Children's Hospital. Surgeons performed five procedures on the child, including the repositioning of his eye and the removal of the implant fitted in the previous surgery.

Doctors told the family that one of the bones had been misplaced and the previous reconstruction had been incorrect.

The 
policeman denied the charges during prosecution interrogations, claiming he had not entered Dubai waters.

'I'm only guilty for violating 
regulations regarding the jet ski,' he said, according to 
prosecution records.

'When my cousin and I were in the sea, we reached 
the Dubai side and saw many coastguard patrols. I thought the shore must
 have been shutdown for some reason and told my cousin we should return 
to Sharjah waters.'

The policeman was not present at a court
hearing on January 7 this year, though 
his cousin arrived with a lawyer.

The case has been adjourned until January 28.
