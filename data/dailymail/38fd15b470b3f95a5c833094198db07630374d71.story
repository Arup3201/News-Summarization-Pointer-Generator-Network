Rodrigo Medellin, 57, from Mexico City, wasn't like other children growing up. Instead of a pet dog or hamster, the animal-mad child kept a group of very unusual creatures in his parent's bathroom - a clutch of vampire bats.

'I would feed them blood from 
cows or from me sometimes,' he remembers. 'I'd keep blood in the fridge so I could feed 
them every night.'

Rodrigo, who is famous in Mexico under the alias 'the Bat Man', grew up to become a conservationist and has made it his mission to get the country's bat species off the endangered list.

Passionate: Rodrigo Medellin, 57, from Mexico City, aka the Bat Man of Mexico, with a Lesser Long Nosed Bat

And he's met with considerable success. In just 30 years, he's created a network of bat-friendly 'safe caves' and pioneered conservation techniques so successful, they've been rolled out to save endangered species all around the world.

But despite his success, Rodrigo says he's still never happier than when deep underground and surrounded by bats.

'For most people, caves would sound like a
 terrifying place, like a place they don't belong, but caves are my 
perfect place. An incredibly peaceful place.

'There's little bats, big bats, short snouted, long snouted, little eyes, big eyes, long ears, short ears, every type of bat,' he continues.

'In Mexico and in other places because of
 what I do, they call me the Bat Man. All I want is that people get the 
right information about bats, about how important they are for us, and 
if that entails them calling me the Bat Man, then so be it.' Laughing, he adds: 'I am the Bat Man!'

Pet: As a child, Rodrigo kept vampire bats in his parents' home, feeding them on animal - and his own- blood

Hard work: Rodrigo has since dedicated his life to saving Mexico's bats, including the Lesser Long Nosed Bat

Tasty: The bat has developed a symbiotic relationship with the tequila producing agave plant

Rodrigo's journey to becoming the Bat Man of Mexico began when he was a child, with his remarkably understanding parents agreeing to let him keep vampire bats as pets.

'That was not easy to withstand,' he admits, 'and still, my parents 
let me do that. It was fascinating to see these bats feeding and 
interacting with each other - they take care of each other so well. It 
was a lot of fun.'

Although he no longer keeps vampire bats as pets, he still spends much of his time squelching through caves splattered with guano in a bid to track and conserve a very different type of bat: The Lesser Long Nosed Bat or Tequila Bat.

'My first Lesser Long Nosed Bat came into
 my hands when I was 15,' he remembers. 'We knew nothing about it and we found out that 
they were really endangered.

'We were looking at roosts that were reputed
 to have many thousands of Lesser Long Nosed Bats but when we visited, we 
found only hundreds or none. That told us they were in trouble.'

Ever since, Rodrigo has made it his mission to save the Lesser Long Nosed Bat, which plays an essential role in producing Mexico's most famous export - tequila.

'As a Mexican, I'm proud of my country and part of the Mexican spirit is a beverage that is called tequila,' he explains.

'Tequila
 is a very important part of the Mexican economy and it is owed to bats.
 Bats provide pollination to the tequila plant, the agave plant.'

The agave plant, a relative, bizarrely, of the hyacinth, is found mainly in Mexico but also in southern parts of the US and in the rest of Central America.

It flowers once every 15 years and relies on the Tequila Bat for pollination - a process that takes place once a year during the bats' migration.

Journey: The Tequila Bat migrates north to the Sonora Desert - with Rodrigo tracking them the whole way

The journey, which takes them 1500km from southern Mexico to the upper reaches of the Sonora Desert on the US-Mexico border, sees them fly along the 'Nectar Corridor' - a strip of land sitting between the Sierra Madre Mountains and the Pacific Ocean.

'The link [between bats and agaves] has been here for 
millions of years,' adds Rodrigo. 'Agaves rely on the bats to move their pod.

'Bats rely 
on agaves so that they can survive. We could not have tequila if it wasn't for the bats.

'When I drink it, I can't help but think about the bats
 and thank them for the incredible service they give us.'

Although bats were once worshipped in Mexico in the form of the Aztec goddess Ītzpāpālōtl who ruled over Paradise, the arrival of Spanish colonists who loathed the creatures kickstarted an almost terminal decline.

When Bram Stoker's Dracula was released in 1897, the association between bats and the forces of evil became even more entrenched.

'To this day, people are afraid, saying that they are filthy and they are everything bad in the world,' complains Rodrigo. 'That is really not the case.'

Free: Rodrigo says despite his successes, there's more work needed to save Mexico's bat species

In a bid to change public perception of bats, Rodrigo has become a one-man PR machine for the animals, travelling the length and breadth of Mexico in a bid to change peoples' minds.

'You can see it in the eyes of people 
when you talk to them - it suddenly all makes sense,' he reveals. 'It all makes sense.

'Their frame of mind changes and they're bat friends from then
 on. And they propagate the message; they talk to people in the home, 
at school, in the office, and suddenly, the message goes snowballing and
 really changes the panorama for the bats.'

And for Rodrigo, the effort really has paid off. Thanks to his hard work, the Tequila Bat population is recovering strongly and has even been taken off the endangered list.

'This is a clear indication that our work is actually having a good impact on the world,' he beams, delighted.

'This is a great day for the Lesser Long Nosed Bat. There's a lot of work to be done but first, it's time to celebrate.'
