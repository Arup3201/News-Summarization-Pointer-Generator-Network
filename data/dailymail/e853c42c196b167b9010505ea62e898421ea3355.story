Alan Pardew has been dealt another injury blow after Rolando Aarons was ruled out until November.

The 18-year-old injured his hamstring in training last week and scan results have now revealed the severity of the problem.

Aarons is facing up to six weeks on the sidelines and that is more bad news for Pardew.

Newcastle manager Alan Pardew is under increasing pressure at St James' Park 

The Newcastle boss is under increasing pressure after supporters turned on him during Saturday’s 4-0 defeat at Southampton.

Owner Mike Ashley will give him time to turn the club’s fortunes around, but in the short term he’ll have to do that without Aarons.

The teenager had impressed during the early part of the season, scoring his first senior goal in the 3-3 draw with Crystal Palace. But having made a scoring debut for England Under-20s, he then strained his hamstring in training and missed United’s trip to St Mary’s.
