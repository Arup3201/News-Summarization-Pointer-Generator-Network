Speaking out: Iain Duncan Smith last night dismissed claims that welfare cuts are causing 'social cleansing'

Iain Duncan Smith last night dismissed claims that welfare cuts are causing ‘social cleansing’.

The Work and Pensions Secretary spoke out after a Labour council suggested it would have to move benefit claimants hundreds of miles because of a new cap on payments.

Mr Duncan Smith said he was ‘appalled and astonished’ by the allegations, adding that there were ‘thousands’ of cheaper properties where tenants could be housed closer to home.

Newham Council in East London said it was writing to more than 1,000 housing associations around the country – including one in Stoke-on-Trent 160 miles away – to try to find accommodation for families applying under the new rules.

As part of its measures to cut the spiralling welfare bill, the Government has introduced weekly caps on housing benefit of between £250 a week for a one-bedroom flat and £400 a week for a four-bedroom property.

The Coalition has also decided to cap total welfare payments at £26,000 a year.

Ministers say it is completely unacceptable that those on welfare have been provided with taxpayer-funded properties costing as much as £100,000 a year to rent. They say that like many of those in employment, they should have to live in more affordable areas.

But Newham mayor Sir Robin Wales insisted spiralling rents in his borough – which is hosting the Olympics – and the housing benefit cap meant it could no longer afford to put up tenants in the private rented sector.

Newham's Mayor Robin Wales said aside from thousands of people needing to be housed in the Olympic borough, there was a problem with overcrowding

‘We are one of the poorest areas in the country, we have massive overcrowding, the people who are here we are trying to deal with,’ he said.

‘What happens? The Government, they pursue policies that push people out from the centre of London out to here.

‘There just isn’t the capacity to deal with them and we end up chasing round the country trying to deal with people who are in need. It is not a policy that I am particularly keen on.’ Gill Brown, chief executive of Brighter Futures in Stoke-on-Trent, one of the housing organisations contacted by Newham, said: ‘I think there is a real issue of social cleansing going on.’

A proposal sent to Tory-controlled Westminster City Council by one of its private providers, Smart Housing Group, suggests rehousing ‘150 people within the next 12 or so months’ as far away as Derby.

Croydon Council in South London has said it is seeking to rent private accommodation in Hull, while Waltham Forest, in North-East London, has moved a small number of families to Luton.

Mr Duncan Smith said the claims from Newham Council were  ‘nonsense’ and that there were ‘thousands of houses’ within a few miles which fell within the cap.

Ministers said there was a £190million fund available to help councils manage the reforms and insisted that even after the cap, families can still claim up to £21,000 a year towards their rent. Mr Duncan Smith said the cap had been in place since April 2011 and ‘every other council’ was ‘managing’.

‘We inherited a housing benefit bill that was out of control,’ he added. ‘We need to get people into housing they can afford to go to work from, so the taxpayer doesn’t have to foot that bill. I suspect this is a little political at a time of local elections.’

A Government source said: ‘These reforms have been up and running for over a year, and any suggestion of “social cleansing” is patently ridiculous and factually inaccurate.’
