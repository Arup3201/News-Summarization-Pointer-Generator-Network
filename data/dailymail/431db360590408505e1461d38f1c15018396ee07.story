One would imagine that Waitrose would give their star writer the VIP treatment, but on Sunday Pippa Middleton proved that she's just like the rest of us as she lugged home her weekly shop.

The writer and socialite was seen laden down with bags from the upmarket supermarket chain, who she joined as a columnist in March, as she shopped in West London.

No doubt the tennis fan was stocking up on strawberries and cream in advance of the Wimbledon championship, which begins today.

And strawberries and cream seemed to be the inspiration behind her wacky wardrobe choice.

The 29-year-old wore a coral cashmere dress and cardigan combination by London label Cashmere by Tania.

Although the twinset was unfortunately ageing on sporty young Pippa as she made a dash to the supermarket the £265 Trixiebelle bodycon dress is described by the company as exuding 'true feminine elegancy ... perfect for a dressed-up dinner.'

The online description continues: 'This simple and elegant short sleeved dress, binds into the waist with a combination of cashmere and silk to enhance on the figure for that perfect looking body.'

The matching £235 cardigan is described as the perfect 'cute cardigan for Spring.'

The Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister often raises eyebrows with her rather dowdy styling and the unflattering woolen dress seemed a strange choice for a trip to the shops, especially when teamed with a pair of canvas pumps.

On Saturday the writer, who has also landed a deal as a contributor for glossy U.S. magazine Vanity Fair, showed off a rather more sophisticated side though as she attended the society wedding of Lady Melissa and Thomas van Straubenzee in Alnwick, Northumberland.

Residents of the village thronged onto the streets to watch guests - including Princes William and Harry - make their way from the castle to the parish church for the wedding and Pippa, dressed in a stylish monochrome dress was greeted at the church gates by cries from the crowd of 'beautiful'.

Later she joined 500 guests to celebrate after the service at the bride's 1000-year-old ancestral home which has doubled for Hogwarts in the Harry Potter films.

Pippa attended the high profile wedding without her stockbroker boyfriend Nico Jackson, 35, but it seems that their romance has stepped up a gear in recent weeks and love must have been on her mind when she wrote her latest recipe instalment for Waitrose magazine – a ‘romantic picnic for two’.

Kate's socialite sister extolled the benefits of ‘whisk[ing] away someone special for an evening of gazing and grazing’ and the Provencal Picnic menu includes peach and vanilla fizz, a fig and goat’s cheese fougasse – a type of bread associated with Provence – smoked chicken and melon salad and strawberry and lavender cheesecake jars.
