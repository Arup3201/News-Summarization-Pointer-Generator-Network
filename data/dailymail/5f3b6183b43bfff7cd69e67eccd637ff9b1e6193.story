It has taken 30 years of diligent collecting for David Bailey to amass 15,000 Hawaiian shirts – the world’s largest collection.

Mr Bailey, the owner of Bailey's Antiques and Aloha Shirts in Honolulu Hawaii, says that he loves Hawaiian shirts, not only because they are a worthwhile investment, but also because they are a cool alternative to formal menswear.

‘I never understood suits. I don’t even own a tie. They’re creepy, actually, if you think about it. They turn people into little robot ants,’ the 69-year-old told Opening Ceremony’s blog in an interview.

‘When you wear a Hawaiian shirt it allows you to express yourself,’ he added of the style, which has recently been reinterpreted by high fashion labels like Prada and Dries Van Noten.

Mr Bailey’s interest in prized vintage ‘aloha shirts’ as he calls them, started off as an accident – quite literally.

He survived a 1,000-foot fall from a building – after which point he sold the jewelry store he had been managing in Santa Barbara to start collecting the shirts because they were both cheap and festive.

Once he amassed a collection of 1,000 he transported the shirts to Waikiki in 1980 and opened a store, which would later move to Honolulu.

Massive inventory: Mr Bailey's many shirts are priced up to $25,000 as many original Hawaiian shirts were hand painted and one-of-a-kind

Worthy investment: Mr Bailey says that the value of his shirts have only soared as he has owned them - making them a much more worthy investment than stocks

Its fans include Nicolas Cage, Anthony Bourdain, and Jimmy Buffett – the latter of which bought $20,000 worth of shirts from the store and has worn many of them on stage.

Mr Bailey's most expensive shirts cost up to $25,000 and he says that vintage Hawaiian shirts are so expensive because many of them are wearable art.

Early styles from the Forties were hand painted and enlisted artisanal stitching techniques.

Now, thanks to modern technology, many of these prints have been recreated on contemporary Hawaiian shirts, rather than hiring artists to create new landscapes and floral motifs – making the mass-produced fare much cheaper.

Because of this, Mr Bailey says that the original aloha shirts (those created prior to the Sixties) have a bigger financial return ‘than the stocks I pick which all uniformly go down.’
