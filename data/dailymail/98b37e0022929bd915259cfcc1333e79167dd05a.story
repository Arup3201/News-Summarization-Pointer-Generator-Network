Admission: Stephen Frost said some of the targets were 'written on the back of envelopes'

Olympics chiefs have paid over the odds for contracts in order to meet self-imposed diversity targets, a senior official has admitted.

Stephen Frost, head of inclusion at this summer’s Olympics, confessed that some targets were ‘written on the back of an envelope’ – but stressed that they had to be honoured.

The comments are likely to infuriate those angry about the cost of attending the Games.

They may also concern MPs, who last month expressed fears that the London Olympics will go way over its current budget of £9.3billion.

The predicted cost of the Games when London won the bid in 2005 was £2.37billion.

Addressing a diversity conference in Toronto, Mr Frost – formerly of gay equality organisation Stonewall – cited an Olympic ‘volunteer selection centre’ as an example of officials shunning the cheapest option.

He said the successful bidder was a ‘little more expensive’ but had ‘guaranteed to do all the work we needed to make the venue more accessible’.

Mr Frost said: ‘All this stuff we’d said in 2005 to get the Games . . . some of it was written on the back of an envelope, quite frankly. We then had to deliver it.’

The Oxford and Harvard graduate also claimed that East London was an ‘urban desert’ before London’s successful Olympics bid.

‘I think if any of you go to London, or have been to London, or know London well, the East End of London is transformed,’ he said. ‘And it’s been a real physical transformation.

‘An area that was an urban desert [with] burnt-out cars, wild cats, unexploded bombs from World War II, poisoned soil, dirty water . . . has now become a really really cleaned-up, thriving community with affordable housing, lifetime homes, medical centres, [and] new hospitals as well as venues built for legacy.’

Mr Frost said the privately-run London 2012 Organising Committee (Locog) had convinced more than 60 businesses to set up a guaranteed interview scheme for disabled people. ‘That for me is systemic change which has benefits, rather than token diversity.’

He also revealed that car-makers that signed contracts with Locog must make vehicles adaptable for disabled drivers. ‘It’s going to be quite nice in London to see VIPs being driven around by disabled folks,’ he said.

Other contract recipients include a minority-owned film company in East London; the Royal Association for Deaf People, which will offer interpretation services; a company run by visually impaired people that will provide cleaning products; and an Asian-owned bus company.

In an interview with a Canadian newspaper, Mr Frost revealed he has consulted with gay former NBA player John Amaechi on the inclusion of gay and lesbian athletes at the Games, and worked with British Paralympic champion Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson on accessibility for disabled athletes and spectators.  

‘The London vision will definitely empower change, enhancing the hiring of disabled people, including gays and lesbians and dealing with homophobia in sport, bringing cultural communities together,’ he said.

‘We’re not going to solve the world’s problems, but we are going to use the power of the Games for change.’

Last September, the Daily Mail revealed that volunteers at the 2012 Games are being offered advice on how to deal with cross-dressing members of the public.

They have been told that if confronted by a man wearing a dress, they should direct him to both the men’s and women’s toilets to avoid causing offence.

Volunteers have also been issued with a list of words or terms they should not use while on duty. Banned terms include carer or helper, to be replaced with personal assistant or support worker.

Staff must also avoid ‘patronising’ young people, the guidelines state, adding that it would be wrong to say ‘young man’.
