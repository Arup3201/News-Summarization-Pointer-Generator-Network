A disqualified driver who had already been banned FIVE times when he crashed on the motorway was spared jail - so he could tie the knot.

James Horan, 28, was sent to prison for four months by district judge Jonathan Taff after the crash in September.

However his lawyer appealed and just 24 hours after a sobbing Horan pleaded to be 
let out, a crown court judge went against the original sentence and his immediate jail term was postponed for two weeks so he 
could marry Tina McGrail, 28.

Offender James Horan wept in court as he described his wish to get married

Road safety campaigners have slammed the decision.

MP Rehman Chishti, who has campaigned for tougher penalties for repeat offenders, said ‘This case is another example of why we need tougher sentences for persistent offenders and for those who drive whilst disqualified.

'It is astonishing that the culprit has been spared jail to be allowed to get married, when people’s lives and safety should be paramount.’

Neil Greig of the Institute of Advanced Motorists said judges were not in tune with public opinion.

‘These sorts of stories undermine the justice system and judges aren’t reflecting the seriousness of what has happened,’ he said.

But speaking after his wedding last Saturday, father-of-three Horan, of East Dene, who owns a tattoo parlour, tried to blame Judge Taff for being too ‘tough’.

‘It was as if he got some pleasure in beating me down and in that moment my life was torn apart. I owe my lawyer a lot and I’m so happy that we were able to get married.

‘We’d gone to court expecting a community sentence. When the judge said it was four months my legs went. I could only think about Tina, my kids and our wedding day.

‘I knew I had done wrong and I didn’t want to get away with it but I never expected him to give me that sentence. It was the toughest he could have been.

'It didn’t feel right, I’ve worked hard to put my life back on track and I hadn’t driven for six years until that day in September. Everyone at the wedding knew what had happened and I know I have let a lot of people down,' he said.

His wife Tina added ‘I couldn’t believe it when I realised the wedding wasn’t going to take place. But the Crown Court judge was really kind and it meant we could get married.

‘Everything went really well and we had a lovely day with our children, our family and friends.’

Horan pleaded guilty to driving whilst disqualified and without insurance following the crash on the slip road of the M18, near Rotherham on September 15.

He is expected back in court next Friday.

Defending him, Ms Hester Russell said Horan had missed a period of work due to post traumatic stress disorder since he was the victim of a serious assault last December.

She said: ‘On that particular day he awoke after an extremely unpleasant night’s sleep and realised he had missed his train.

‘Realising that he’d already upset his employer he decided, utterly foolishly, to take his partner’s car.’
