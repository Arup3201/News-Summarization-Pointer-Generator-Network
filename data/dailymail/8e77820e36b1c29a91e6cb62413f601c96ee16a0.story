Lee Rigby's heartbroken fiancée and estranged wife both sobbed with relief today after one of his Muslim extremist killers had an appeal against his murder conviction thrown out in just 45 seconds.

The soldier's future bride Aimee West said she hoped 'this is the last we will hear from them' as Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 23, also lost appeals against their life sentences for the 'barbaric' murder.

Rebecca Rigby, who was married to the Fusilier and had his son Jack, said the family is 'relieved that this is over and justice has been done'.

Adebolajo ran down the 25-year-old soldier in Woolwich south-east London in May last year before 'butchering him' with his accomplice.

Both had denied murder because they were 'soldiers of Allah' but were found guilty at the Old Bailey last December. 

Members of the soldier's family, including his fiancée Aimee and also his estranged wife Rebecca Rigby, broke down as the High Court as their applications were rejected by judges.

Adebolajo's legal team today claimed he should have his conviction quashed because he was 'at war' with Britain, before also failing to argue his whole life sentence should be reduced.

His application for leave to appeal was rejected by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, sitting at the Court of Appeal in London with Lady Justice Hallett and Mr Justice Openshaw.

They spent less than a minute explaining why they would not agree to it, and later called the argument pushed by his QC 'hopelessly misconceived'.

Anyone in Britain who believes they have suffered an injustice when convicted of a crime can make an application to appeal the decision. If accepted a full hearing will be held at the Court of Appeal.

The judges then heard argument on behalf of Adebolajo against a whole-life sentence which condemns him to die behind bars.

Lawyers for his co-accused Michael Adebowale, who was jailed for life with a minimum term of 45 years, were also arguing for a reduction in sentence.

But Lord Thomas said it was 'just' punishment for the 'horrific and barbaric' murder.

Adebowale, who appeared from Broadmoor jail via video link did not react while Adebolajo, who is at HMP Frankland, had refused to appear for the hearing at all.

Members of Fusilier Rigby's family gasped with relief and there were tears as the decision was announced.

Bereft: Rebecca Rigby, the estranged wife of Lee Rigby and mother of his son Jack, was in court for the hearing, as was the soldier's fiancée Aimee West and both sobbed as the appeals were rejected

After the decision was announced, Fusilier Rigby's fiancee Aimee West said: 'I am relieved and thankful with the outcome of today's hearing.

'I hope that this is the last we will hear from them both, so that I can focus on rebuilding my life and keeping Lee's memory alive.'

Choking back tears, Lee Rigby's estranged wife Rebecca said: 'I would like to thank everyone who made today's verdict possible.

'We are relieved that this is over and justice has been done. I would like to thank everyone for their continued support over the last 18 months and hope I can now build a future for my son Jack and ensure his (Lee's) memory lives on.' 

The British-born Muslim converts ran 25-year-old Fusilier Rigby down in a car before hacking him to death with a meat cleaver and knives in a frenzied attack in Woolwich, south London.

They dumped the body of the father-of-one in the middle of the road near Woolwich Barracks in south east London on May 22 last year.

Plot: Adebolajo and Adebowale lay in wait near the barracks and picked Fusilier Rigby to kill after assuming he was a soldier because he was wearing a Help for Heroes hooded top and carrying a camouflage rucksack

Adebolajo and Adebowale lay in wait near the barracks and picked Fusilier Rigby to kill after assuming he was a soldier because he was wearing a Help for Heroes hooded top and carrying a camouflage rucksack.

After driving into him, the killers - who had armed themselves with eight knives, including a meat cleaver and a five-piece set bought by Adebolajo the previous day - butchered him in the street in broad daylight in front of horrified onlookers.

Both men were shot by police in dramatic scenes captured by CCTV.

They claimed they were 'soldiers of Allah' and were motivated by the plight of Muslims abroad to carry out the killing.

Both were convicted of murder at the Old Bailey and sentenced in February.

Explaining his decision to give Adebolajo a whole-life term, trial judge Mr Justice Sweeney said he was the leader of the murderous plot and had 'no real prospect of rehabilitation'.

However, Adebowale's younger age, mental health problems and 'lesser role' meant that he escaped spending the rest of his natural life behind bars.

Whole-life terms came under the spotlight earlier this year when judges at the Court of Appeal ruled that murderers who commit the most 'heinous' of crimes can be sent to prison for the rest of their lives.

Those currently serving whole-life terms in England and Wales include Moors Murderer Ian Brady, who tortured and murdered children along with accomplice Myra Hindley, and serial killer Rosemary West.
