An injured boy was heard screaming 'someone needs to help my mummy and baby and brother' after a mother-of-three was stabbed to death.

Officers launched a murder probe after they were called to a house in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, last night following calls from members of the public about a domestic-related incident.

When police arrived they found a 37-year-old woman, who neighbours said was mother-of-three Emma Mansell, with serious stab injuries. She was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead a short while later.

Victim: A 37-year-old woman, named locally as Emma Mansell (pictured with partner Johnny Sutton), died from stab wounds after she was found by police at a house in Huddersfield

Tragedy: Neighbours said that Emma and her partner, named locally as Johnny Sutton, had four children between them

A 39-year-old man, believed to be her partner, was 'detained' at the
 scene and taken to hospital where he was described as having 
suffered 'serious injuries'.

Neighbours described how they saw a young boy dashing from the house pleading for help and shouting 'someone needs to help my mummy and baby and brother'.

One resident, who did not want to be named said the youngster had been covered in blood.

'I heard a noise and looked out of my blind. I saw the little boy and he was absolutely covered in blood,' she said.

'I saw my two other neighbours run out and as I came out they said a boy had been run over.

'He ran straight out of the alleyway 
of his house and on to the road. He said "someone needs to help my mummy
 and baby and brother".

Injury: When police arrived they found a 37-year-old woman with serious stab injuries inside the home. She was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead a short while later

'Someone came out with the baby and the blanket had blood all over it. There were police that way and ambulance the other way.'

Police confirmed that a nine-year-old boy was found outside the house with a stab wound to his arm.

A six-year-old boy, an 11-year-old boy and a six-month-old baby girl were also present and treated for minor injuries.

Neighbours said that Emma and her partner, named locally as Johnny Sutton, had four children between them.

Mother: Locals said Emma had two young sons and a baby daughter with Mr Sutton, who also has a son

She had two young sons, he has a son and they have a baby daughter together, according to those living nearby.

Police have not yet formally identified the victim, and have not given the name of the man.

Other neighbours said they only knew Emma to say hello to and say her mother, who lives close by, keeps herself to herself.

'I'd seen the children playing in the garden a lot,' said  Jayne Werritt.

'I heard a commotion at 9pm and I thought it was just children playing.

'I couldn't hear anything significant, just noise. I've lived here for a long time and it's just tragic.

'These children have lost their mother. You've got to think about the poor people that are left behind.'

Others living in the residential street said that Emma had separated from her husband around 18 months ago before beginning a new relationship with Mr Sutton - who they described as a labourer she had met in a local pub.

Marcel Adams, one of Emma's childhood friends, said: 'I can't believe it. I can't believe this has happened to Emma.

'She was always so lovely and kind. She's had a lot of things happen to her in her life. She lost a child to meningitis years ago and she has always just tried to get on with things.

'I went to the hospital this morning and I bumped in to her sister Nicola. She came up to me and just broke down in my arms.

'She told me that the two boys had been injured. I asked if they were both going to be ok and she said yes.

'Apparently Emma was madly in love with her partner but I never knew him. I saw her a few months ago and she was crying so I asked what was wrong. She didn't want to tell me but I told her she knew where I was if she wanted to talk.

'It's just so sad. You don't expect this.'

Senior Investigating Officer, Detective 
Chief Ady Taylor said: 'A 39-year-old man was detained at the scene and 
is being treated in hospital today for serious injuries. We are not 
looking for anyone else in connection with this incident.

Probe: A forensics officer photographs the garden of the house when the 37-year-old woman was found with severe stab wounds

Search: Forensic teams comb the garden of the house for evidence that may give clues as to how the woman died

Duty: One officer was stationed to the back of the house, while forensic officers placed markers in the road outside as they searched for clues

Arrest: A man was arrested at the scene and was taken to hospital where he was described as having suffered 'serious injuries'

Evidence: Police sealed off the street and this forensic officer was seen bringing items from the house in a plastic evidence bag, while another was seen walking into the house

'Enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident andÂ  Neighbourhood Policing Team officers are patrolling the area, offering support and reassurance to local residents.

This morning police were guarding a cordon across the residential street as officers including forensics experts searched the terraced home.

A forensic tent had also been set up close to the house and a number of police vehicles were parked outside.

Shock: Neighbours described how they saw a young boy dashing from the house pleading for help and shouting 'someone needs to help my mummy and baby and brother'

Operation: Police have said they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident

Procedure: Police have not yet formally identified the victim, and have not given the name of the man

Horror: Neighbours said they had seen a baby being brought out of the house, its blanket covered in blood

Protection: Officers were seen walking to and from a large forensic tent put up close to the home
