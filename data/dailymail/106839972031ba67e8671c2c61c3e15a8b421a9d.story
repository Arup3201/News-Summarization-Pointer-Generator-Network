Deprived of talisman Neymar, there is an apprehension consuming Brazil as they approach the momentous World Cup semi-final against Germany on Tuesday evening.

Utterly dependent on the flair and inspiration of Neymar so far in the competition, the onus will now be on the misfiring Hulk and Fred to offer the creative spark to carry the host nation to a date with destiny at the Maracana on Sunday evening.

However, as the Brazilians step out in Belo Horizonte, it will be a peculiar feeling as Luiz Felipe Scolari’s side emerge without Neymar for the first time in over two years and 38 international games at the Estadio Mineirao. Indeed, not since a 3-1 victory over Denmark in May 2012 have Brazil entered the field without Neymar at their disposal.

Hero: Neymar has carried the hopes of a nation on his shoulders during the World Cup in his homeland

Perfect timing: Neymar (right) scores for Brazil against Cameroon in the opening game of this World Cup 

Rest on his shoulders: Neymar offers Dani Alves a hug before the last-16 clash against Chile

Zero: The stricken forward lies in agony after breaking a bone in his back against Colombia

Brazil have been defeated just four times over the course of the 38-game period – the equivalent of an entire Premier League season – and the tension that has paralysed the host nation since Jonathan Zuniga crashed into the back of Neymar on Friday evening appears to have tangible foundation.

* Neymar has started Brazil’s last 38 matches, a run stretching back to May 2012.

* Brazil have played just six of the their last 60 matches (including friendlies) without Neymar since 2010 World Cup.

* Last game Brazil played without Neymar was a 3-1 victory over Denmark, May 26, 2012.

* They have won five of those six matches without him, none of which were competitive.

* Six matches Brazil played without Neymar since WC 2010….

2-0 v Ukraine (2010)

3-0 win v Iran (2010)

2-0 win v Egypt (2011)

2-0 win v Gabon (2011)

3-1 win v Denmark (May 2012)

1-0 loss v France (Feb 2011)

Neymar is the flame-haired poster boy of this World Cup and the Brazilians, who have struggled to inspire even with the Barcelona superstar, will have to tap into their reserves of determination to ride a tidal wave of emotion and reach the final.

The dependency on Neymar has been well-documented, the Brazilian scoring four goals, committing opponents and making things happen almost single-handedly for his team. 

This reliance is nothing new, though, for Brazil have gradually become increasingly dependent on Neymar since they restructured their team around him following the disappointing quarter-final exit at the 2010 World Cup.

In the 60 matches that Brazil have played since the defeat by the Netherlands in South Africa four years ago, Neymar has played 54, as he has emerged as the golden boy of the country under the guidance of Scolari.

The 22-year-old has represented his nation in every competitive game over the last four years, missing only six friendly games in that time.

Spot on: Neymar scores during the shootout after Brazil and Chile drew their last-16 clash in Belo Horizonte

Been there before: Neymar scores a penalty against Team GB  in Middlesbrough during the 2012 Olympics

Golden boy: The totemic forward celebrates another goal against Belarus at Old Trafford

Lots of heart: The 22-year-old star had lit up the World Cup, despite the intense pressure, before his injury

As it transpires, Brazil have fared relatively well in his absence, winning five of those six friendlies and losing one against France. Admittedly, though, the competition in those games was not the most arduous, as Brazil defeated relatively accommodating opposition in the shape of Ukraine, Egypt, Iran, Gabon and Denmark without the services of Neymar, which rather skews the 83 per cent success rate without him in the side.

Suffice to say that Tuesday evening against Germany will offer a rather more stern appraisal of this Brazil team’s credentials without their brilliant forward.
