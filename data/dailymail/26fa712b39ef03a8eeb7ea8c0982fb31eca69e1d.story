It is hard enough climbing up a mountain when you've got two legs.

But for legless Chen Zhou reaching the summit is an extraordinary achievement considering he can only do so by using his arms.

The 29-year-old, from Cangshan in China's Shandong province, lost both his legs after falling off a train at the age of 13.

Determined: Chen Zhou, 29, climbs up Mount Huashan, in Huayin in China's Shaanxi province, by using his arms

Hard work: Chen hoists himself up a vertical cliff face

He has since strived to achieve more than most able-bodied people would even dream of.

His latest mission took him two days -
 19 hours in total - climbing with his hands and arms to the top of 
Huashan Mountain in Huayin, Shaanxi province.

After his exhausting climb, Chen was met by his wife and children at the top.

He next plans to tackle Mount Taishan in Shandong province in the coming months.

He has already conquered all of 
China's five mountains but has one romantic inspiration left - to 
celebrate Valentine's Day, which falls on August 23 in China, with his 
wife atop Mount Tai.
