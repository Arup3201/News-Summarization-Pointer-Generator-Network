There once was a time when American workers loved nothing more than to celebrate the end of a hard day's graft by blowing the froth off a few cold beers.

Just two decades ago beer was by far the most popular alcoholic drink across the country.

But now trouble is brewing in the beer business as Americans appear to be turning their backs on ale for a more refined taste of wine... and bottled water.

The beer years: Just two decades ago beer was by far the most popular alcoholic drink across the country

A new report by Gallup has revealed that in the last 20 years, per capita beer consumption has plummeted across the US by 20 per cent.

In its place, wine, tea and liquor have enjoyed a bumper decade while milk, soft drinks and juice are increasingly being left at the back of the fridge.

But the runaway success over the last ten years is bottled water as health-conscious Americans battle to live longer and look better.

Oh beer! Per capita beer consumption has dropped from 47 per cent in 1992 to 36 per cent today while wine and spirits enjoyed a rise from 27 per cent and 21 per cent respectively to 35 per cent and 23 per cent

Wine not? Americans appear to be turning their backs on ale for the rather more refined taste of wine

Back on the bottle: The report has revealed that in the last 20 years, per capita beer consumption has plummeted while the nation's taste for bottled water, wine and spirits has soared

'You're seeing that the consumer is taking a healthier look and having more alternatives [than soda], such as tea, and coconut water,' Thomas Mullarkey, an analyst from Morningstar, told The Atlantic. 'But also, Americans have aged, and soft drinks are most popular among teenagers and twentysomethings.'

The biggest drop in beer was among young Americans and non-whites - the two fastest-growing demographics of US society.

According to the report, young adult drinkers' alcoholic drink preferences have changed dramatically over the past two decades.

Time at the bar: There once was a time when American workers loved nothing more than to celebrate the end of a hard day's graft by blowing the froth off a few cold beers

In the early 1990s, 71 per cent of adults under the age of 30 said they drank beer most often, whereas that umber has dropped to 41 per cent.

For the same age group, 14 per cent said they liked wine and 13 per cent spirits in 1992 compared to 24 per cent and 28 per cent respectively now.

The survey's other findings include:

But while beer-drinking has fallen in the U.S. as a whole, it has increased in some states - for instance, it actually increased in Vermont by seven per cent over the last three years.

In October, the Beer Institute revealed New Hampshire as the biggest beer-swilling state where residents drink on average 43 gallons of beer a year each. The Granite State was followed by North Dakota (42.2 gallons), Montana (40.6 gallons), South Dakota (38 gallons) and Nevada (36.5 gallons).
