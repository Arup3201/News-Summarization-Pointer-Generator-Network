Do I welcome the news that Next is about to overtake M&S? Sales at Next grew 7.2 per cent last year, to £4 billion, while it’s predicted that clothing sales at Marks & Spencer will have drooped like so many Per Una gypsy skirts when figures are announced later this week. They will also be about £4 billion.

I loved Next, the brainchild of George Davies, when it launched in 1982. It was the first brand to give us affordable luxury, with its very first campaign giving us chunky 100 per cent wool knits, soft chambray, and very British tweed.

It gave us the revolutionary Next Directory in 1988, a classy precursor to online shopping, and of course in 1998 pioneered selling fashion online, becoming the largest ‘etailer’ in Europe.

Now, though, I find its success troubling: it survives and conquers through bargain-basement prices, undercutting Marks by scrimping on quality. A real leather weekend tote in the very first Next Directory cost £99; today a similar version is £72. In 1988 a wool blazer was £60; today a synthetic version is £34.

And it flourishes, of course, by offering young women instant credit: I must point out its interest fees are ferocious – as is its hounding of late payers. To achieve these startling new figures, Next has abandoned what it once did really well – classy tailored minimalism for the office – and now chases catwalk trends. But it has always thought on its flatform-shod feet, while M&S seems to lumber, and is offering quality, yes, but at prices women now habituated to cheap fashion baulk at. (Remember the recent £345 all-wool winter coat?)

After comparing the two giants’ ranges here, I think it’s time Marks’s style director Belinda Earl went five days a week from her current three, don’t you?

The smart outfit for a wedding... or for work 

NEXT: Foil pleated skirt; £45 Blush formal jacket, £34

This accordion pleated midi skirt is a couple of years too late, but I love it, and I love, too, the soft pink jacket. It’s very Rick Owens: long, lean and slim fitting. The outfit only works on the slim – pleats are never good on the wide of berth.

M&S: M&S Collection double breasted Crêpe Drape coat, £65; Cut-out rear panelled skater dress, £45

A trench may seem strange for a smart wedding, but it could work with a hot coloured dress poking out below. Sling it over your shoulders for work.

And the winner is... 

Next wins for being truly conventional, which is what women want for work or a formal occasion – but do beware the midi length, which can be frumpy: you will need to make sure the rest of you is sleek, with killer heels, not flats. 

The 'casual gypsy' look  

Casual gypsy: Next steals the win by a whisker with an ochre crochet trim top (left) over M&S's fringed kimono

NEXT: Ochre crochet trim top, £28; flared jeans, £20

The jeans are almost identical to M&S’s, but crucially cheaper. The top will have people asking when the baby’s due, but at least shows some flesh.

M&S: Limited Edition fringed Kimono jacket, £39.50; flared jeans, £29.50; vest, £9.50

The jeans are nice and inky, but quite narrow for flares, while the gypsy top is just awful: it swamps the wearer.

And the winner is...     

Next by a whisker.  

The summer dresses 

Summer dresses: Marks and Spencer's Per Una Lace Shift dress (right) wins hands down over Next's sack-like printed folk dress (left)

NEXT: Paisley print folk dress, £30

A little bit sack-like, but I can see this with a tan and gladiator sandals being worn on holiday by the young and leggy. 

M&S: Per Una Lace Shift Dress, £75

This dress is lovely: a very current, sub-Erdem print, a scalloped hem that softens the knee area, and a bit of a sleeve, which is what women told Marks and Spencer’s style director Belinda Earl they want – plus it’s easily smart enough for a wedding.

And the winner is...   

M&S wins hands down: it has a sexy shape, but is forgiving, too.   

The suede persuasion  

Suede persuasion: M&S win by a country mile with the Autograph Suede Skirt (right) while Next's effort (left) completely missed the boat on the trend  

NEXT: Suedette Tassel Jacket, £55 Dark denim flared jeans, £20

Next completely missed the boat on this trend: all they have in suede is this jacket with tassels, just £55 as it’s faux. 

M&S: Autograph Suede Skirt, £199; Autograph knitted jumper, £35

When Alexa Chung was photographed in this very now Autograph suede skirt last week, the M&S website started smoking, even though it won’t hit stores until April 10. Suede and leather always do well for M&S and this will shoot off the rails: it’s not mumsy, and feels luxurious. Younger women will opt for the shorter, £75 version at Topshop.

And the winner is...

M&S, by a country mile: real skin at Next would be prohibitively expensive, so in a way it’s great they don’t even try. 

The funkiest of the accessories 

Funky accessories: Next takes the win by a nose with accessories including a fringe rucksack and flatforms (left) over M&S's faux leather cross body bag and sling backs (right)

NEXT: Denim flatforms, £35; Suede fringed rucksack, £62 (Flared jeans, £28; Blush utility jacket, £55) 

Much funkier than M&S, Next has done lots of small, neat saddle bags, too, which were all over the catwalk.

M&S: Limited Edition faux leather cross body bag, £35; Autograph sling backs, £45 (Per Una white jeans, £39.50, Autograph knitted jumper, £35)

A huge improvement on last summer. The cross body bag is a good size, and faux is infinitely better than cheap nasty leather. The sling backs are very Kate Middleton. 

And the winner is... 

Next by a nose.
