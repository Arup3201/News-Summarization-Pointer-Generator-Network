If you thought the weekend’s glorious weather was too good to last, think again.

We’ve got at least another three days of beautiful sunshine ahead of us.

The Met Office predicted highs of 21c (70f) across the country for today, tomorrow and Wednesday.It comes after parts of Britain enjoyed temperatures higher than those recorded in Cannes and Crete.

Scotland noted a record temperature for March, 22.8c (73f), beating the previous March high of 22.2c in 1965. This was also the warmest temperature in the UK yesterday.

Forecasters predict chilly starts followed by sunshine and highs of 21c in both the North and the South over the next few days.

Rebecca Sherwin, a Met Office forecaster, said: ‘The weather is reasonably unusual for this time of year.

‘We’ve got high pressure sat over the UK at the moment, causing very settled weather. It means the day warms up very quickly in the morning.’

Cooling off: Hundreds of people flocked to Brighton beach to soak up the sun today, including Londoners Rania Nafissah, left, Jessica Pearcey, centre, and Kym Shaen-Carter

Yesterday saw many beaches and parks packed as temperatures rose to more than 11c above the seasonal average. One group of charity fundraisers took advantage of the warmth to strip off for a game of naked miniature golf.

The group of 30, who raised more than £3,000 for The Prostate Cancer Charity, set a world record at Southend seafront, Essex – for the most naked people to play miniature golf in one hour.

Yesterday’s highest temperature – at Fyvie Castle in Aberdeenshire – beat many of those in the Middle East. It was 19c (66.2f) in Tel Aviv, and 18c (64.4f) in Tehran. Temperatures failed to get above 19c in Cannes, Majorca, or Crete.

Hot work: The heat was too much for some as the sun-seekers on Brighton beach today basked in balmy temperatures and uninterrupted sunshine

A quick dip: Student Lexi Payne, 19, wades into the sea off Bournemouth beach, in Dorset, today while enjoying the scorching temperatures which ushered in British Summer Time

But it wasn’t all fun in the sun. It was cloudy and misty in some eastern, coastal areas of Britain.While this weekend’s warm spell was good news for many, it will add to fears of droughts this summer.

The Environment Agency says it has been the driest March since records began and hosepipe bans are due in many areas from April 5. A spokesman said: ‘What we really need is a prolonged period of rainfall.’

Three-day forecast

The combination of soggy summer, mild winter and recent warm weather will make this year’s display of spring magnolias the most spectacular in living memory, say experts.

The trees are likely to be at their best over the next two or three weeks.

Colin Crosbie of the Royal Horticultural Society gardens at Wisley, Surrey, said: ‘We were lucky to have a wet warm summer which was great for bud formation, followed by a mostly mild winter so the buds weren’t damaged.’

The Environment Agency says it  has been the driest March since records began.

A spokesman said: ‘We’re working with farmers to keep them going through the summer. However, it’s been a very dry week and river levels are continuing to fall.

'Obviously, it’s nice to have a sunny weekend but what we really need is a prolonged period of rainfall.’

He may have just lost his job at the Royal Bank of Scotland but Peter Phillips was all smiles in the sunshine yesterday.

The Queen’s grandson was enjoying himself with his wife Autumn and their 15-month-old daughter Savannah at the Gatcombe Horse Trials in Gloucestershire.

Peter, 34, who jointly organised the trials at the country home of his mother, Princess Anne, became a high-profile victim of the massive jobs cull at the bank after handing in his notice as head of global sponsorship. He had worked at the company for seven years.

But the casually dressed Royal looked as if he didn’t have a care in the world yesterday as he swung Savannah playfully through the air before cradling her gently in one arm.

Peter’s 33-year-old Canadian wife, dressed in a baggy white top and black trousers, restrained herself from such games as she is expecting the couple’s second child this month.

As for Savannah, the one thing she could bank on was getting  an ice cream – but whether her pink gingham outfit escaped unscathed was not guaranteed.
