Jose Mourinho can boast title triumphs in England, Italy and Spain but he ranks the prizes won with Porto as his greatest achievements.

Mourinho, who left Porto for Chelsea in 2004 after two Primeira Liga wins and a Champions League success, was back in his homeland after being named Portugal’s coach of the century.

He won the Premier League twice in his first spell with the Blues before claiming two Serie A crowns with Inter Milan and a La Liga triumph with Real Madrid.

But, in Estoril to pick up his latest award as the Portuguese Football Federation celebrated its 100th anniversary, he said: ‘Obviously the titles that I won with Porto in this context are the most important in my career because they were titles won with a Portuguese team for Portuguese soccer. 

'With Porto it was a unique case because that was winning a Champions League final with nine Portuguese players. Would I like to see it happen again? Yes I would, yes.’

Mourinho’s Porto beat Monaco 3-0 in the 2004 final – he also won the Portuguese Cup, UEFA Cup and Portuguese Super Cup - and as he chases four trophies with Chelsea this year the 51-year-old is happy to fly the flag for his homeland.

He added: ‘It represents a sensation of not only have reached so many goals in my career but also in some way have contributed to Portuguese soccer. 

'I have not been here for 12 years, 12 years away, but even in being away I have always tried to dignify my country and Portuguese soccer.’
