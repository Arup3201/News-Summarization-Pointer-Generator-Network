British Prime Minister David Cameron used his opportunity to speak at Parliament House in Canberra to poke fun at his 'strong friend' Tony Abbott's 'shirtfronting' threat to Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

In his special address to the Australian Federal Parliament, Mr Cameron touched on the Ebola crisis and joked: 'I’m wondering if we are heading to what we now need to call a "shirtfronting"?’

Before he quickly added: ‘But no, typically Australia is always there with action not words.’ 

The British leader told of the ‘enormous affection’ Britain and Australia have for each other as he gave a rousing speech

He compared the ‘successful multicultural democracies’ of both countries, and said: ‘I am incredibly proud to be here today in Canberra.'

Mr Cameron described how coming to Australia ‘is like visiting family and I don’t just say that because my own Australian auntie is watching from the gallery.’

He paid tribute to the ‘thousands of Australian troops who stood and fought and fell’.

‘I especially think of Gallipoli, which I visited as a young man with Aussies and Kiwis around me… we were moved beyond words by what our forefathers had done before us,’ he said.

Mr Cameron said he thought ‘every chapter of Australia’s story has been inspiring’.

‘You have always been a pioneering country and today you are writing another chapter in your vibrant story,’ he added as he gave a hat tip to Australia’s ‘thriving economy’ and ’23 years without a recession’.

Full pomp and ceremony were laid on for Mr Cameron's visit including cannons being fired and a marching band. 

He inspected Australia's federation guard before listening to the British national anthem, followed by Australian anthem Advance Australia Fair.

He then went inside the House to sign the visitors’ book and walked into Parliament to applause from the Senators and shook hands with Speaker Bronwyn Bishop.

Mr Abbott began: ‘The arrival of the first Britains here in Australia could hardly have been less auspicious… only 48 of 1,400 died.’

The Australian PM spoke about the first fleet and how over two centuries the descendants of convicts have helped create a society that means ‘to be born Australian is to have won the lottery of life’.

The two leaders stood on a podium to listen to the countries' national anthems

‘There is so much that Britain has given to us… parliamentary democracy, the common law and English.’

‘What would this world be without the plays of Shakespeare, the music of the Beatles… or the determination of Churchill?,’ Mr Abbott asked.

‘What would the world be if Britain had not settled the territory that Captain Cook earlier called New South Wales?… we are still family, the relationship between Britain and Australia has changed beyond recognition but it’s still important and we still matter to each other.’

Mr Abbott spoke about Britain and Australia’s alliance in military battles and the ‘airmen in the skies’.

‘History matters because it helps us to know who we are and where we are going,’ Mr Abbott said.

He also spoke about the modern battles both countries are now facing, particularly against terrorist organisation ISIS.

‘I admire what Mr Cameron has achieved... thanks to his leadership Britain counts for more than it did five years ago,’ Mr Abbott said as he praised the leader’s ‘robust common sense’.

Opposition leader Bill Shorten said the countries now ‘great each other as equals and partners in the world’.

‘Whether it is the Ashes, rugby, netball… we relish an international sporting rivalry… we are both good losers and fantastic winners,’ Mr Shorten said.

He described Britain as a country ‘that has always made us feel at home’.

Mr Shorten also spoke of his pleasure that Mr Cameron would get to visit Australia’s national war memorial. 

Earlier in the day, after touching down in Sydney on Friday morning, Mr Cameron first met Mr Abbott for a business breakfast at the Barangaroo Delivery Authority.

But not before he had taken in the city's iconic sights such as the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House with Mr Abbott as his knowledgeable tour guard.

The British PM remarked: 'It's such a beautiful city, I've never seen Sydney before.' 

Mr Cameron is expected to announce that Australian businessmen and women who regularly travel to the UK are to get new rights to be fast-tracked through British airports, on Friday.

At the business breakfast, Mr Cameron said Australian investment in Britain is an important part of his country's infrastructure program.

'We believe this infrastructure should go ahead with massive amounts of investment and partnership between Britain and Australia,' Mr Cameron said.

The men prepared for a stressful weekend ahead, as the world's leaders come together to discuss economic problems 

'We think it's one of Britain's great success stories and strengths that we welcome foreign investment.

'As well as welcoming the investment, frankly we welcome the expertise. And this is where I think there can be an exchange between Britain and Australia.'

He said despite Australia and Britain's competitiveness on the cricket pitch and rugby, the two nations were 'incredibly collaborative', and he said Britain considered it as part of its success story that it is a destination for foreign investment. 

Under the scheme, expected to be announced then, business figures, entrepreneurs and investors who have visited the UK four times within 12 months will be able to apply to use electronic passport-reading gates in future to speed their transit through Heathrow and Gatwick airports.

The scheme will also be open to Australians with extended leave to stay in the UK who regularly travel between the countries.

The scheme is expected to benefit about 75,000 Australians.
