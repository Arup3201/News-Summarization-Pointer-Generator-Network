More than 20,000 people descended on Stonehenge to greet the sunrise on the longest day of the year.

Cloudy skies prevented the gathering of pagans, druids and partygoers, from basking in the sun as they marked the summer solstice.

By sunset last night, 2,000 people had arrived at the stone circle to begin an overnight vigil. Their numbers swelled before the sun reappeared just before 5am.

The celebrations came ahead of a 'historic moment' in the ancient Wiltshire site's £27million transformation, where a nearby road will be closed and grassed over to restore one of the key approaches to the stones.

Police made 22 arrests during the night, mainly for drug offences, which is fewer than in previous years. They praised the 'positive, friendly atmosphere' of the celebrations.

Thousands of people spent the night at Stonehenge, watching the sun set then waiting for it to rise on the longest day of the year

About 21,000 people, including pagans, druids and partygoers, were at the ancient monument by dawn to greet the longest day of the year

The stone circle was open to the public for the solstice celebrations, and is usually protected by a cordon

Superintendent Matt Pullen from Wiltshire Police said: 'The majority of people respected the conditions of entry and the amnesty bins provided were used.

'Approximately 70 cannabis street warnings were issued. As with previous years, the passive drugs dogs proved very effective.

'The success of the event depends largely on the good nature of those attending and we are pleased that people could enjoy solstice in the spirit of the event.'

The summer and winter solstices are one of the few chances to walk among the stones and dance within the stone circle, which is usually cordoned off to visitors to protect the site from further erosion.

Those gathered performed chants and music during the celebrations, with some also taking part in handfasting ceremonies where they promise to love each other for a year and a day, or for how long love will last.

The solstice, which means the sun is standing still, was also marked by about 500 people at Avebury, Wiltshire, and a small crowd armed with golf umbrellas at Castlerigg in the Lake District, who kept watch for the sunrise at stone circles there.

About 2,000 druids, pagans and partygoers had arrived at Stonehenge by sunset last night to await the dawn, with thousands joining their ranks during the night

From Monday, the final steps in 
Stonehenge's transformation will begin. Part of the road running 
alongside will be permanently closed as part of a long-awaited 
refurbishment of the World Heritage Site.

The
 closure and grassing over of the A344 will make Stonehenge fully part 
of the landscape again, allowing visitors to relieve the walk between 
the stone circle and the prehistoric avenue that used to be the approach
 to the monument.

It is 
part of work which includes the creation of a new visitor centre around 
1.5 miles away from the monument, with a cafe, shop and museum showing 
artefacts and exploring theories about Stonehenge, as well as three 
replica neolithic houses.

Loraine Knowles, Stonehenge director 
at English Heritage, said the closure of the road was 'a real milestone 
in terms of the history of the site'.

She said that the current setting of the stones meant visitors could not fully enjoy and appreciate the site.

English Heritage had wanted to close the road since it was nominated as a World Heritage site and inscribed in 1986, she said.

'It really is a historic moment,' she added.

In the first stage, work will begin to remove tarmac on the road and grass it over.

Once a new visitor centre opens in 
December, a longer section of the A344 between Stonehenge and the new 
facilities will be shut to traffic and become the route for visitors 
walking or travelling by shuttle to the stones.

The cramped existing car parking and visitor facilities, first built in 1968, will be removed and the area returned to grass.

Ms Knowles said: 'When you are in 
Stonehenge in the future, when grass is established, you will be able to
 make the link between the monument and the rest of the heritage 
landscape to the north, accessing the avenue, the route by which the 
monument was approached when it was used as a place of great ceremony.'

Closing the road was 'absolutely 
fundamental to all the improvements we're making to the setting of the 
monument and all the improvements we are making to the visitor 
experience', she said.

More than a million people visit Stonehenge every year.

Barb
 and Rick Oddy, from Vancouver, Canada, visiting on a coach tour just 
before the solstice, agreed that closing the road to link up the 
landscape was a good thing.

Ms
 Oddy said of the monument: 'It's amazing. I can't decide which theory I
 believe and I think it's amazing how they (the stones) got here from 
Wales.'

But concerns have been raised that 
the changes to the site will have a bad effect on coach tours, which 
stop at Stonehenge as one of a series of destinations.

There are fears that some tour 
operators may bypass the site because of the extra time involved in 
transferring groups from a more distant visitor centre by shuttle to the
 monument.

The busy A303, 
which runs on the other side of Stonehenge, will remain as plans to put 
the road into a tunnel proved too expensive.

The
 refurbishment was due to be finished in time for the London Olympics, 
but was delayed as a result of Government cuts which left English 
Heritage seeking to fill a £10million funding gap. It was met by an 
increased grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and other sources.
