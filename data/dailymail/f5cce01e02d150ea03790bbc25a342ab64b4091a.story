Prolific: Michael Dwyer, pictured in a police mugshot in 2012, has 170 convictions to his name

A career criminal who clocked up 170 convictions has walked free from court again after being handed his fourth ‘last chance’ to turn his life around.

Michael Dwyer, 31, had already been handed three ‘last chances’ by judges – two in 2004 and one in 2011 – after being convicted of dozens of burglary offences.

But after he blamed his two decades of burglary, theft and violence on a drug problem this week a judge again decided to free the serial criminal.

Recorder Tina Landale told him: ‘You have been a drug addict for most of your life and it’s clear you committed crime to support your drug habit.

‘But maybe this time you are willing to change and I am prepared to give you one last chance. Really take the chance.

‘Things are changing for you and you have got a much brighter future if you co-operate.’

Last night anti-crime campaigners condemned the judge as ‘weak-minded’ and said his release was an insult to his dozens of victims. Mohammed Iqbal, leader of Pendle Council, Lancashire, where Dwyer lives, said: ‘For someone to commit that level of crime over such a prolonged period of time shows what a menace he is to people. Clearly he has no regard for the law or the community.

‘What is the point in people reporting crime, or the police putting in all of the hard work in bringing him to court if this crook is just going to get a slap on the wrist.

‘This is Groundhog Day justice. Every time he commits a crime he’s told it’s his last chance, but clearly it isn’t. He just keeps on getting away with it time after time.’

Dwyer, a heroin and valium addict, committed his first crime when he was just 11, and by the age of 20 had racked up over 100 convictions.

His first last chance came in July 2004, when he was in court for stealing a Hyundai coupe and almost mowing down a garage boss locking up his compound, causing £3,500 of damage before speeding off on a near 500-mile joyride.

He admitted aggravated vehicle taking, theft and other motoring offences – but was merely given a 12-month drug treatment and testing order by magistrates, who told him: ‘You have a chance to sort yourself out.’

But less than six months later, in December 2004, Judge Beverley Lunt also gave him ‘one last chance’ when he appeared before court, where he was convicted of stealing a van and handling stolen goods.

In July 2004, Dwyer was in court after he stole a Hyundai Coupe and used it to mow down a garage boss,causing £3,500 worth of damage.

He admitted aggravated driving, theft, two charges of driving while disqualified, damage and three allegations of no insurance. 

He was given a 12-month drug treatment and testing order.

In December 2004, he was given another 12-month drug treatment and testing order for stealing a car and handling stolen goods.

In September 2007, he was jailed for 90 days after he and his cousin used a stolen taxi to try and get cash to fuel their drug habit. 

In April 2008, he was jailed for 14 days after he and his brother went on a thieving spree.

In February 2011, he was arrested for burglary after breaking into a diner and stealing from the till.

He was given a 12-month community order, including supervision and a three-month nightly curfew.

In January 2012, he was given six months in jail for affray.

Three months after his release, he was jailed for another two years for raiding a pensioner's home. 

The latest offences happened in September this year when Dwyer was caught on his way to carry out a theft with a large wrench stuffed up his sleeve and a Stanley knife in his pocket.

She handed him another 12-month drug treatment and testing order. Yet in September 2007 he was hauled back in front of a judge and jailed for 90 days after he and a cousin used a stolen taxi to try to get cash to feed their drug habits.

In April 2008 he was back in court again and jailed for 14 days for stealing lead from roofs.

Then Dwyer was arrested for burglary in February 2011, this time after breaking into a diner and stealing £45 from the till and £75 from under the counter.

At the time he had a staggering 151 convictions – but was given another ‘last chance’ by the court with yet another 12-month community order with supervision and a three-month nightly curfew. His lawyers had argued he ‘had a chance to reflect on his life, with the imminent arrival of his second child’.

But less than a year later, in January 2012, Dwyer was given a six-month sentence for affray over a fight in which he smashed a window.

Unbelievably, just three months after his release he was again before the court after he raided a pensioner’s home when she was out.

This time Judge Beverley Lunt – the same judge who had freed him in 2004 – sentenced him to two years in prison, telling him: ‘Nothing deters you.’

At his latest appearance before Burnley Crown Court this week, Dwyer was facing up to three years in jail after he was caught equipped for a theft with a large wrench up his sleeve and a knife in his pocket.

But he walked away with a 12- month community order with supervision and a drug rehabilitation requirement – after a probation officer said Dwyer was ‘willing to address his behaviour’.

Richard Taylor, defending, said Dwyer was on a methadone reducing programme and it was just over a year since he was last in trouble.

A spokesman for Families Against Crime said: ‘This type of sentencing is no deterrent to hardened criminals and if judges can’t take a tough line on law and order then who will. Judges need to be strong not weak-minded.

‘This criminal appears to be untouchable and as long as that continues then he will carry on breaking the law and making people’s lives a misery.’

LAST CHANCE 1 July 2004: Dwyer admits aggravated driving and theft after stealing a Hyundai coupe and causing £3,500 worth of damage. Magistrates tell him he is being given ‘a chance to sort yourself out’ and hand him a 12-month drug treatment and testing order.

LAST CHANCE 2 December 2004: He is given another 12-month drug treatment and testing order for stealing a van and handling stolen goods. Judge Beverley Lunt tells him he is being given a ‘last chance’ to get back on the straight and narrow.

LAST CHANCE 3 February 2011: He is arrested for burglary after breaking into a diner and stealing from the till. He is given a 12-month community order and a three-month curfew after his lawyers say he has ‘had a chance to reflect on his life, with the imminent arrival of his second child’.

LAST CHANCE 4 October 2014: Dwyer is caught on his way to carry out a theft with a wrench stuffed up his sleeve and a Stanley knife in his pocket. Recorder Tina Landale says she is giving him ‘one last chance’ to turn his life around with a community order.
