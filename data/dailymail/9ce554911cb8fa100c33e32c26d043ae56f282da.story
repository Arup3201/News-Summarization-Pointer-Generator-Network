Supermodels are probably inundated with flattering offers of dates from love-struck men all the time. The only trouble must be deciding which ones to accept.

But Claudia Schiffer knew exactly what to do when she received a rather indecent proposal of her own – walk away with her head held high.

The German-born model has told of her outrage when an Arab prince asked to ‘hire her’ for a dinner for £1million.

German-born model: Claudia Schiffer as told of her outrage when an Arab prince asked to 'hire her' for a dinner

Recalling the most bizarre moments of her career, Miss Schiffer said: ‘The strangest one was an Arab prince. He asked if he could hire me for a dinner for a million pounds. I declined, and some other supermodel took it.’

Miss Schiffer added: ‘It’s not all about money. I just want to be able to walk down the street and be proud of what I do.’

Miss Schiffer’s encounter is reminiscent of 1993 film Indecent Proposal, in which a billionaire played by Robert Redford offers Demi Moore’s character $1million to spend the night with him. 

But she doesn’t take the moral high ground and accepts, after agreeing it with her husband, played by Woody Harrelson, who is in need of the money to set up a business.

She has become known for her glamorous appearances at the school gates after being photographed in the latest trends.

But she said she makes an effort only because she feels pressure from fellow mothers.

She told the Jonathan Ross show: ‘First of all I knew I had to dress up a bit, because all the other mums looked really pretty when they took their kids to school.

‘I didn’t really mind it, I just thought,  “Pretend they’re not there and just do your thing and don’t really watch out for them”.’

And Miss Schiffer said she is so shy she struggled to hide her blushes when she was modelling.  

‘I would always turn bright red, and so then I became even more shy, thinking, “I don’t want to be here”. Once I put the make-up on I’d go, “OK, I can cope, no one can see what I’m thinking”.’

Miss Schiffer also revealed she has no concerns about getting older, saying: ‘I just think it’s a part of life.’
