Tomas Rosicky stole the show as Arsenal beat Brighton 3-2 in their FA Cup fourth round clash, but Phil Neville caused uproar when he flippantly claimed he would have 'two-footed' him for some of his antics.

The Gunners' Czech midfielder scored one goal and set up another, but former Manchester United defender Phil Neville felt some of his tricks showed a lack of respect for the opposition.

Three times during the game, including in the build up to his own goal, Rosicky passed one way and looked the other - something Neville said would have earned him a strong challenge if he'd been fooled by it.

Neville made the comments on Match of the Day, but later claimed it was 'tongue in cheek'

Speaking on BBC One, Neville said: 'If that was a training session and somebody did that I'd be first over there and I'd probably look to two-foot him or take him out of the game.

'If somebody did that in training to me, winding me up, I would be straight in there. I'd smash them.'

The comments led to a wave of incredulity from Arsenal supporters online, and Neville was forced to clarify his position. 

He tweeted: 'The Rosicky "look one way pass the other" piece was tongue in cheek by someone who wasn't capable of doing such!!!'

One man who definitely didn't agree with Neville's assessment was Gunners boss Arsene Wenger, who said: 'If you love football, you love Rosicky.'
