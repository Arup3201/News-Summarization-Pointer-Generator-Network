England's World Cup-winning women made a triumphant return to Twickenham on Monday, with head coach Gary Street calling for increased funding to allow his team of plumbers, teachers and policewomen to turn professional.

Street, a former quantity surveyor who has gone on to become a central figure in the growth of women’s rugby in England, said sponsors would be ‘crazy’ not to support a sport which has seen playing numbers more than double to 18,000 over the last 10 years.

More than two million television viewers in France watched England beat Canada 21-9 on Sunday in a final played in front of 20,000 in Paris and shown in 137 countries.

Street believes the ever-growing audience means it is only a matter of time before money is provided to allow top players in England — some of whom quit their jobs for the World Cup — to become fully-fledged professionals.

‘The girls are professional, apart from the fact they don’t get paid,’ said Street. ‘The television audience in France, with sold-out stadiums, showed there is a market when the product is so good.

‘Sponsors would be crazy not to jump on the back of that. I don’t think professionalism is too far away.

 ‘A senior IRB guy I spoke to was very anti-women’s rugby when I met him 10 years ago but he called last night and said he had no idea women’s rugby could be so good.’

Street’s players, who received messages from England captain Chris Robshaw and World Cup winner Jonny Wilkinson, will be back down to earth with a bang this week.

‘I go back to work on Thursday,’ said flanker Marlie Packer, a plumber from Yeovil.

‘I won’t know what job I’m doing until they send it down. It could be a blocked toilet, a leaking pipe, changing a tap washer, you never know.

‘We’ve made sacrifices to get here but winning a World Cup makes it worthwhile.’
