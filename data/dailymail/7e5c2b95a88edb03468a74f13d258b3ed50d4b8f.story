Pensioners will suffer a double blow today with the arrival of freezing weather and news that their energy bills have doubled in seven years.

Forecasters say temperatures could plummet as low as minus 10C over the next few days with snow in many parts.

The cold snap will put huge pressure on the elderly who are increasingly fearful of turning up their heating because of the soaring cost.

Struggling: Pensioners will suffer a double blow today with the arrival of freezing weather and news that their energy bills have doubled in seven years

Preparation: Highway Agency workers in County Durham prepare gritters ahead of this weekend's cold snap

Winter: Fog descended in Danbury, Essex on Thursday ahead of snowy conditions expected this weekend

The average gas and electricity bill for the over-65s reached £1,356 last year – more than double the figure of £669 seen in 2005.

Pensioners were forced to find £17.4billion to stay warm and keep the lights on in 2012.

Five of the ‘Big Six’ energy firms put up their tariffs as winter began, blaming higher wholesale energy prices and the cost of Government initiatives promoting green energy and household insulation.

The sixth firm, E.on, will push up its gas bills by 9.4 per cent and electricity by 7.7 per cent on January 18.

The elderly are particularly sensitive to energy price rises because they spend more time at home.

Experts warn that thousands will die from medical conditions made worse by living in a cold house.

Official figures put the number of ‘excess’ winter deaths at 24,000 last year – far worse than colder countries such as those in Scandinavia, where home insulation is a high priority.

Saga says its analysis shows the portion of income spent by over-50s on fuel has increased at a faster rate than for the rest of the population.

They say seven million over-65s are already struggling to pay their heating bills – while many are rationing their use of the central heating or gas fires.

A survey of 8,500 over-50s found that 58 per cent are worried about the costs of heating their homes this winter and more than seven million – 35 per cent – are already struggling with heating bills.

Many rely on the annual Winter Fuel Payment, which is currently worth between £100 and £300 based on age, to keep warm.

However, all political parties are looking at capping, cutting or removing the payment.

Such changes, providing political parties are willing to take on the powerful pensioner vote, would not come into effect until after the next election.

Saga’s director general, Dr Ros Altmann, said: ‘Energy prices are continuing to increase and we are still to feel the full effects of the latest price rises so energy costs are likely to put even more of a financial strain on households in 2013.

‘While incomes have increased in the last seven years, they have not kept pace with the rate that energy and fuel costs have risen, meaning that people are spending more of their income on fuel.

‘This is especially true for older people who are often on lump or fixed incomes or whose savings income has fallen.’

She added: ‘We know from our own research just how much of a burden energy prices are on the finances of those faced with fixed or dwindling incomes, especially older generations, of whom 29 per cent are having to raid savings every month in order to make ends meet.’

Age UK’s director general, Michelle Mitchell, said: ‘Cold homes clearly pose a serious health risk and with energy bills spiralling upwards, many older people will be struggling to heat their homes this winter.

‘These people are facing serious pressures on their meagre household budgets and are too often being faced with the choice of heating their homes or eating.

‘The cold is a huge health risk for older people leading to thousands of preventable deaths and illnesses every winter.’ The group advises the elderly to ensure the temperature in their living room does not drop below 21C while the figure is no lower than 18C in the bedroom.

Saga is supporting a voluntary scheme where wealthy pensioners can choose to donate their Winter Fuel Payment to others in need.

The Surviving Winter campaign, which is backed by a raft of celebrities, including Stephen Fry, Dame Vera Lynn and Sir David Jason, has raised £1million so far this year.

Work: Councils will be keen to avoid the blunders of recent years when they have run out of grit

Money is used to help vulnerable people cover their energy bills, install insulation or practical help, such as providing hot meals.

The Government insisted there is a range of schemes that will help pensioners.

It said energy firms are required to help poorer households by providing subsidised or free home insulation under the Energy Company Obligation scheme.

Other options include the Green Deal  system of loans to fund home improvements and the Warm Home Discount scheme, which offers a £130 saving on energy bills to up to 1.1m of the poorest pensioners.

Greg Barker, energy and climate change minister, said: ‘A warm home should be a given, not a luxury. That’s why we  want to make sure everyone is aware of  the support available.’
