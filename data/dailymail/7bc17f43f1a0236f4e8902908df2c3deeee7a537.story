The lead singer of Keane has issued a warning to brazen thieves who stole a diamond ring from his wife's jewellery box, telling them: 'We're coming for you!'

Frontman Tom Chaplin posted an angry tweet after thieves raided the home he shares with wife Natalie Dive in Wittersham, near Hastings, East Sussex and stole the ring. 

The 35-year-old vocalist and songwriter also urged his 16,500 followers to keep their eyes open for the missing jewellery, which was apparently taken during a New Year's Eve raid 'despite the alarm blaring'.

The 35-year-old singer, who said the raid took place on New Year's Eve, shared the furious tweet with his 16,500 followers

The square-shaped ring belonged to his wife Natalie Dive (left), with whom Chaplin is pictured in 2006 

He write: 'To the c**t who burgled my wife's jewellery despite the alarm blaring last night, we're coming for you! Photos of stolen items to follow.'

He then posted pictures of the square-shaped ring, before adding: 'Pawnbrokers, antique shops, jewellers and punters - if you see this ring being punted, tweet me. Reward for info.'

Chaplin, along with Tim Rice-Oxley, Richard Hughes and Jesse Quin formed the piano-led quartet Keane in 1995.

All four of the band's albums made it to number one in the UK charts and the group scored a massive chart hit with Somewhere Only We Know.

He then tweeted a photo of the diamond ring and offered a reward to anyone who finds the missing item
