A new recording of the owner of the LA Clippers shows how he lashes out at his girlfriend for hanging out with black people.

Donald Sterling is heard telling off his girlfriend, who goes by V. Stiviano, that he doesn't want her bringing any black people to his team's basketball games.

'You can sleep with (black people). You can bring them in, you can do whatever you want. The little I ask you is not to promote it on that... and not to bring them to my games,' Sterling is heard saying on a tape obtained by TMZ.

Hypocritical: Sterling told his girlfriend V. Stiviano (pictured left and right), who is Mexican and African-American, that she can sleep with black people but shouldn't bring them to Clippers games

The spat reportedly started when Stiviano, who is Mexican and African American, posted a photo of herself and Magic Johnson on her Instagram page.

'It bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you’re associating with black people. Do you have to?' Sterling is heard saying.

'I’m just saying, in your lousy f******* Instagrams, you don’t have to have yourself with, walking with black people.

'Don't put him (Johnson) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me.  And don't bring him to my games.'

The photo with Johnson has reportedly been taken down and Stiviano has locked it so that her Instagram feed is private.

She
 and Sterling, who is still legally married but has been separated from 
his wife Shelly for years, appear to have an open relationship.

At several points on the tape, the 81-year-old billionaire claims that he is not racist but does not understand why his girlfriend wants to publicize her relationships with people of color.

Magic 
Johnson, who retired from the Los Angeles Lakers in 1991 and returned 
for a single season in 1996, spoke out against the comments and said 
that he will never attend another Clippers game while Sterling is the 
owner.

'I
 feel sorry for my friends Coach Doc Rivers and Chris Paul that they 
have to work for a man that feels that way about African Americans,' he 
wrote on Twitter, citing some current Clippers players.

'LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling's comments about African Americans are a black eye for the NBA.'

He expanded on his thoughts to TMZ, saying that he does not think the players should boycott but the fans should.

'He wants our money but doesn't want us to show up,' Johnson said.

'I thought we were friends. We've broken bread together several times. It's almost like, do you smile in my face but behind my back you talk about me? I'd have felt better in 1979 if you would have just told me you don't like African Americans, and then I would have known how to deal with you.

'He has to step down or sell the team.'

The recording has prompted calls for a boycott of the team by the NBA and fans alike- including former sports broadcaster Keith Olberman and Snoop Dogg, who posted an expletive-laced video on his Instagram account.

'A message to the motherf***** that owns the Clippers. You b****-a** redneck white-bred chickens*** motherf*****: F*** you, your momma and everyone connected to you, you racist piece of s***. F*** you,' the rapper says in an Instagram video he posted to his account Saturday morning. 

The NBA 
has now launched an official investigation into the recording, and the 
league's spokesman Mike Bass called the comments 'disturbing and 
offensive'.

This is not the first time that Sterling has been accused of being racist.

He was sued twice by the federal government after refusing to rent apartments to minorities.

In the 2005 case, he was ordered to pay a $2.73million fine to settle.

In
 a 2009 case, he was accused of refusing to rent to non-Koreans when it 
came to a property in Koreatown and refused African American tenants for
 a property in Beverly Hills.

He was reportedly accused of saying that he wouldn't rent to Hispanics because they 'smoke, drink and just hang around the building'.

The suit also accused Sterling of saying 'Black tenants smell and attract vermin'.

He was also named in a 2003 lawsuit wherein he crudely described how he had sex with a prostitute who charged $500-per-tryst. 

In that case, he admitted that 'maybe I morally did something wrong' but went on to explain that 'it was purely sex for money, money for sex, sex for money, money for sex,' according to records obtained by The Smoking Gun.

The conversation is allegedly between Donald Sterling and his girlfriend, who goes by the name V. Stiviano, who identifies herself as part Mexican and part African American.

VS: I wish I could change the skin. The color of my skinDS: That isn't the issue. You've missed the issue. VS: What's the issue? DS: The issue is we don't have to broadcast everything. VS: I'm not broadcasting anything. I don't do anything wrong.

DS: Why are you taking pictures with minorities... why?

The conversation centered around a now-deleted photo that Stiviano put on Instagram of herself and Magic Johnson (pictured)

VS: What's wrong with minorities? What's wrong with black people? DS: Nothing, nothing, nothing. VS: What's wrong with Hispanics?DS: It's like talking to an enemy. There's nothing wrong with minorities, they're fabulous. Fabulous. Because you're an enemy to me. VS: Why?DS: Because you don't understand. VS: I don't understand what? DS: Nothing, nothing. VS: That racism still is a lie?DS: No but there's a culture. VS: What culture?DS: People feel certain things. Hispanics feel certain things towards blacks. Blacks feel certain things towards other groups. It's been that way historically and it will always be that way. VS: But it's not that way in my heart and in my mind. DS: But maybe you want to adjust to the world.

DS: Yea it bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you're associated with black people. Do you have to?VS: You associate with black people. DS: I'm not you and you're not me. You're supposed to be a delicate white or a delicate Latina girl. VS: I'm a mixed girl. DS: Ok well. VS: And you're in love with me. And I'm black and Mexican. Whether you like it or not. Whether the world accepts it or not. And you're asking me to remove.... you want me to have hate towards black people?DS: I don't want you to have hate. That's what people do- they turn things around. I want you to love them- privately. In your whole life, everyday you can be with them. Every single day of your life. VS: But not in public?DS: But why publicize it on the Instagram and why bring it to my games?

Recorded: A call between Sterling and his girlfriend was released and he is heard making racist assertions

VS: I can't believe that a man who's educated, a man who's a scholar, a man...DS: Well believe it, and stop talking about it. Let's finish our discussion with a period, ok?

VS: I took a picture with someone I admire (Magic Johnson).DS: GoodVS: He happens to be black, and I'm sorry. DS: I think the fact that you admire him- I've known him well, and he should be admired. And I'm just saying that it's too bad you can't just admire him privately, and during your entire f****** life, your whole life- admire him, bring him here, feed him, f*** him, I don't care. You can do anything. But don't put him on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me. And don't bring him to my games, OK?
