Starting young: Austin's first cigarette was an unfiltered Camel stolen from her father while she was in junior high

Debi Austin, the star of the most famous anti-tobacco commercial ever, passed away Friday after decades of battling the chronic health issues left to her by a three-pack-a-day smoking habit

America first met Austin as she picked up a lit cigarette and took a long drag through the hole in her throat.

In the commercial, she said she started smoking when she was 13 and they told her nicotine wasn't addictive.

'How can they say that?' she asked as smoked curled up around her face.

The mid-90s ad turned her into a hero for the anti-tobacco movement.

She died Friday at Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys at the age of 62 following a 20-year battle with cancer.

The LA Times reports she was born in April 1950 in Illinois and her family moved to Los Angeles when she was 4.

She had her first drag of a Camel unfiltered while walking home from junior high. She'd stolen it from her father.

By high school she was smoking a pack a day, and the habit got worse as she went to UC Berkeley and later managed a private telephone company.

Towards the end of her habit she was burning through two to three packs a day.

In 1992 she found a small lump in her jaw and was diagnosed with Cancer of the larynx.

- Smoking  can also lead to coronary heart disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S.

- Tobacco deaths outpace those related to HIV, illegal drug use, alcohol, motor vehicle injuries, suicides, and murders combined.

- Smoking reduces circulation by narrowing the blood vessels, thereby putting smokers at risk of developing an obstruction of the large arteries in the arms and legs which can result in pain, tissue loss, and gangrene.- Smoking causes an estimated 90 per cent of all lung cancer deaths in men and 80 per cent of all lung cancer deaths in women.- Smoking causes roughly 90 per cent of all deaths from chronic obstructive lung disease.- Smoking can increase the risk of coronary heart disease or stroke two to four times over.- Smoking is responsible for about one in five deaths annually in the U.S., totally 443,000 people.

- On average, smokers die 13 to 14 years younger than nonsmokers.

It was not her first smoking-related health issue. In the early 1980s she was treated for a chronic sore throat.

She had a laryngectomy to remove the tumor and her vocal chords, and 
learned to talk again using esophageal speech, or 'burp talk.'

She agreed to make the commercial after seeing her 4-year-old niece draw a black dot on her own throat and say: 'I want to be like you.'

Austin said she was 'well compensated' for the commercial and finally quit smoking eight months after it was first broadcast.

Austin's ad is 'the most-recognized and talked about California tobacco control ad,' according to a statement from the State Department of Health, released after her death.

'Debi was a pioneer in the fight against tobacco and showed tremendous courage by sharing her story to educate Californians on the dangers of smoking,' Dr. Ron Chapman said in the statement.

Austin then traveled around the state to tell young people about the dangers of tobacco, and made two more anti-smoking ads that aired in 2011.

Her health had been forever crippled by her nicotine habit.

'I have a constant upper-respiratory infection. I have
emphysema and they want to put me on oxygen but I refused, because once
you’re on it you stay on it. So I have to have forced air at night,' she told the LA Times in an interview about the 2011 campaign.

'I am the worst-case scenario that your mother told you about,' she said. 'I am the walking dead, the cast-off of the tobacco industry that they can't fix, they can't heal.'

She later joined a support group for people who'd undergone the same surgery.

'I'd never met or heard anyone who'd had a laryngectomy,' she told 
The Times in 1997. 'I thought, 'Omigod, I make my living on the 
telephone and now I'm going to sound like Elmer Fudd on Thorazine for 
the rest of my life.''

Bad habit: Austin smoked for decades, continuing to smoke through the hole in her throat even after being diagnosed with cancer

She is survived by her sisters, Jamie Marshall of Portland 
and Deena White of Canoga Park; and brother, Jim Gardner of Camp 
Verde, Ariz.

'True to Debi’s spirit, she was a fighter to the end and leaves a big 
hole in our hearts and lives,' the family said in a statement to ABC News.

'Debi will be remembered fondly by those 
who love her to be caring, courageous, very funny and always there to 
offer advice or lend a hand. She was passionate and outspoken about what
she believed in and deeply touched all who knew her or heard her 
story.'
