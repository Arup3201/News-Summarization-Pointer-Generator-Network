Arsene Wenger is adamant that the best is still to come from Mesut Ozil, explaining the Arsenal playmaker returned from the World Cup injured.

The Gunners boss revealed his £42.5million record signing was not fully fit at the beginning of the season, despite being given an extended period of rest following Germany's World Cup triumph.

Ozil has not played for Arsenal since tearing knee ligaments in a 2-0 defeat to Chelsea in October. 

Mesut Ozil will show his 'best for Arsenal in seasons to come' claims Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger

Wenger signed Ozil for £42.5million in the summer of 2013 and believes he will get better for Arsenal

The Arsenal boss also revealed Ozil returned from Germany's World Cup victory with an injury

And Wenger was also visibly annoyed when asked  if midfielder Abou Diaby is 'injury prone'.

Wenger, speaking on beIN Sport on Sunday, said: 'He (Ozil) will not be back until January. He came back from the World Cup with an injury.

'He had a very good first season with us. I think we will see the best of Ozil in the seasons to come.'

But when asked about Diaby, who has suffered injury after injury in the last few seasons and has played just one League Cup match this campaign, Wenger insisted the 28-year-old was not injury prone.

Abou Diaby is not 'injury prone' or 'fragile' either, believes Wenger, despite his succession of fitness issues

He continued: 'He (Diaby) is a player that I have an enormous amount of respect for.

'Everytime he comes back, he has to start from zero with another injury. He was a victim of competition.

'A footballer needs his ankle. He was destroyed by a bad tackle (in May 2006, leaving him with a fractured ankle) at Sunderland six or seven years ago which altered his ankle.

'He is not a fragile player. He was the victim of an assassin's tackle that went unpunished.'

Meanwhile, Wenger also revealed he tried to sign Juventus star Paul Pogba for Arsenal.
