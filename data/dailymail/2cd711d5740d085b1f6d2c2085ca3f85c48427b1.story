At 27 you may have expected Zhang Feng to settle down with someone her own age but instead she has fallen in love and had a child with Wen Changlin who is the grand age of 72.

Zhang was just 15 when Wen, a 60-year-old Chinese medicine practitioner, began caring for her sick father.

After her dad died, Zhang declared her love for Wen and the couple now have a baby boy called Tian which means heaven.

Wen moved into Zhang's family home in 2006 and continued to live there after her father passed away. 

In 2009 he moved out thinking he was no longer needed when Zhang's relatives encouraged her to get married.

But Zhang, who was 23 at the time, expressed her love for Wen telling him: 'I want to take care of you for your remaining years, and I want to live with you.' 

Wen said: 'I was hesitating, as we have such a great age gap and villagers were whispering and her mother was against this strongly.'

However, Zhang had fallen head over heels and last December she found out she was pregnant.

The couple got married and baby Tian, which means 'heaven', was born.

Wen, who had four children before he met Zhang, said: 'He is a heavenly gift to me. This is the happiest time of my life.

'I didn't have the feeling when I got married for the first time and had four children, as those are expected, but now it's the true joy to me.'

Meanwhile, Zhang says she is enjoying married life. 'I am living in real happiness every day. We don't have much romance, but we are living in happiness.'

Zhang's mother, who is 66 years old, is now living with the newly married couple and helps them to take care of their newborn son. 

'I don't have much against it now, as long as they are happy.'

Wen's three sons and his daughter share the same view. 

His daughter, who is 42, said: 'She takes good care of my father, and they are living with joy. God bless them'.
