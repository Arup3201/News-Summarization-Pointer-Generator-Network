If the idea drums up enough business for Darren Abey, this time next year he could be a miwlionaire.

Fans of John Sullivan's BBC comedy Only Fools and Horses have been given the chance to have the last laugh by being transported to their funeral in this hilarious three-wheeler Trotter hearse.

Mr Abey, 46, a single father from Fleetwood, Lancashire, spent a year and around £10,000 building the hearse - which was originally a Reliant Rialto car - and has already had his first funeral bookings.

He who dares: Only Fools and Horses fans have been given the chance to have the last laugh by being transported to their funeral in this hilarious three-wheeler New York-Paris-Peckham hearse

Fancy a ride? Darren Abey, 46, of Fleetwood, Lancashire, spent one year and around £10,000 building the hearse - which was originally a Reliant Rialto car - and has already had his first funeral bookings

‘Everyone’s seen the traditional black hearses you get,’ Mr Abey said. ‘They’re a bit boring. I wanted to create something for all those characters out there like me who fancied a change.

‘I got a really good reaction from the first funeral. People were saying the car really stole the show - but that’s what the Trotters would have done. It’s the best comedy show ever.’

The former truck driver hopes his idea proves more fruitful than the many failed ventures of Del Boy, played by David Jason, and his hopeless brother Rodney, Nicholas Lyndhurst, in the comedy classic.

The yellow hearse is towed by an original Reliant Robin as seen in the show. It went on display as part of an open day at a north-west funeral centre last Saturday, where it attracted much attention.

Tribute: Mr Abey is a lifelong Only Fools and Horses fan and claims to have seen every episode several times

Idea: Single father Mr Abey said his daughter thought he was mad when he first came up with the hearse

Staff at The Co-operative Funeralcare in Withington, Greater Manchester, marked their official opening to show people unusual funeral options available.

Branch manager Gordon Whitehead said: ‘Rather than mourning, we’re finding more and more people are looking for something a bit different for funerals now.

‘It is things that celebrate a person’s life or reflect their interests, and the Only Fools and Horses hearse got a really good reaction.’

Mr Abey is a lifelong Only Fools and Horses fan and claims to have seen every episode several times.

Set in Peckham, south London, the 
comedy followed market trader Del Boy and ‘plonker’ Rodney’s half-baked 
get-rich-quick schemes. The yellow Reliant van featured in each 
episode’s title sequence.

Mr Abey said his daughter thought he was mad when he first came up with the hearse.

‘I’m
a huge fan of the show and thought I’d create something unique,’ he added.

‘A few people have said to me “that’s exactly how I want to go”. I
made it because I thought funerals are too sad now. We
should be celebrating someone’s life, not mourning it.

'The first 
funeral we were booked for, everyone looked at us at first with their 
mouths wide-open.  But a few seconds later they started laughing and 
that’s what it’s all about.’
