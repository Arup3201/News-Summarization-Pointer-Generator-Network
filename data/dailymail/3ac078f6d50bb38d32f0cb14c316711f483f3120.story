Theresa May insisted yesterday she did not authorise the publication of her explosive letter to Michael Gove, as she repeatedly stonewalled questions from MPs over how much she knew about the leak.

As speculation swirled about the impact of her spat with the Education Secretary on a forthcoming Cabinet reshuffle, Mrs May told MPs that an inquiry by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood had cleared her of releasing the correspondence.

The letter, which was published on the Home Office website, dramatically escalated a bitter row between the two ministers over extremism in schools.

Mrs May hit back at criticism of her handling of anti-terror policy, and showed no sign of backing down in her row with Michael Gove

The Home Secretary was asked seven 
times by Labour MPs about whether she knew the letter to Mr Gove would 
be made public at some point, whether it was written in order to be 
leaked, and why there was a three-day delay in removing it from the 
website. But she would say only that she had not authorised its release.

Labour
 claimed the publication of the letter – in which Mrs May demanded to 
know what the Education Department had done about warnings of extremism 
in Birmingham schools in 2010 – was a breach of ministerial code if it 
was authorised by the Home Secretary.

Asked
 by Labour MP Nic Dakin whether she knew her special adviser Fiona 
Cunningham – who was forced to resign at the weekend over the incident –
 was going to publish the letter, Mrs May simply insisted it was ‘a bit 
rich getting so many questions about special advisers from the party of 
Damian McBride’, a reference to Gordon Brown’s disgraced spin doctor.

Labour's Yvette Cooper accused the government of losing control of policy to deal with extremism

Asked
 by veteran Dennis Skinner whether she was battling Mr Gove because she 
was ‘getting ready for a succession battle’ for the Tory leadership, Mrs
 May replied icily: ‘I do not think that question should be dignified 
with a response.’

Shadow 
home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘The Home Secretary claimed she did 
not authorise the release of the letter. Yet time and again she refused 
to answer whether she wrote it in order to leak it, who did release it 
and why she left it on the Home Office website for three days.’

There
 is anger among some Tory ministers that Mr Gove, who started the row by
 using lunch with the editor of The Times to attack Mrs May and her 
counter-terrorism adviser Charles Farr, has been let off with a slap on 
the wrist.

David Cameron is
 finalising a Government reshuffle which is expected to take place 
within the next week. And one Cabinet source said: ‘Michael was on the 
move to party chairman – it has certainly been discussed.

‘Now
 it looks harder to do it because it would appear like a demotion 
because of the row with Theresa. Michael has done this over and over 
again – had a row internally and then leaked it – and people are frankly
 fed up with it.’

Events last week were 'shambolic for 
the Government, but much worse for everyone else' and must not be 
repeated, said the shadow home secretary.

She
 demanded assurances from Mrs May and Mr Gove that they 'will not put 
their personal reputations and ambitions ahead of making the right 
decisions for the country'.

Ms
 Cooper asked why Mrs May had allowed her letter to remain on the Home 
Office website for three and a half days before it was removed, and 
demanded to know: 'Did she write that letter in order for it to be 
leaked, and did she authorise its release to the media?'

She
 asked whether Mrs May stood by her claim in the letter that oversight 
arrangements for schools in Birmingham were not 'adequate'.

Mr Gove sat just feet away from Mrs May, as she insisted she was in charge efforts to tackle extremism

Mrs Cooper said that the Home Office's strategy on preventing extremism had been 'criticised from all sides, not just by the Education Secretary, for failing to engage with local communities and having become too narrow, leaving gaps.'

She added: 'She now needs to focus on getting those policies back on track, because it matters to communities across the country that there's a serious and sensible approach to these issues and joint working at the very top of the Government.'

To cheers from the Tory benches, Mrs May retorted: 'We have excluded more hate preachers than any Home Secretary before me. I have got rid of the likes of Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada.

'The Government does not give a public platform to groups that condone or fail to distance themselves from extremism and we are mapping out for the first time extremists and extremist groups in the United Kingdom. We make sure that the groups we work with and fund adhere to British values and where they do not we do not fund them and we do not work with them.

'None of these things was true when the party opposite was in power.'

Mrs May called on Ms Cooper to withdraw any allegation that she had breached the ministerial code, saying that the Prime Minister and Sir Jeremy had concluded that she did not.

'Yes, we need to get to the bottom of what has happened in the schools in Birmingham, but it is thanks to this Education Secretary that the Department for Education has for the first time a dedicated extremism unit to try to stop this sort of thing from happening,' said the Home Secretary.
