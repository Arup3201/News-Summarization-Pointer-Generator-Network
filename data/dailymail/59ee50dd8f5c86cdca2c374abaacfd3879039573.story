A 14-year-old boy was filmed as he was knocked out with one punch 'for being gay'.

But despite being hit in the back of the head as he was walking away, the boy has been banned from a mall for fighting.

He was walking out of the Coronado Mall in Albuquerque when he was punched in the head by a 16-year-old.

Issaic and his friends are leaving the Coronado mall after getting into a row with an older teen when he is filmed being chased from behind and punched

Issaic said it is unfair that he has been banned from the mall for fighting when he was the one who was hit

The boy, called Issaic, had his back turned to his attacker and was taken completely unaware by the punch.

However, despite being assaulted the mall gave both teens the same punishment and banned them both for a year.

Issaic told KOB Eyewitness News 4 he was targeted for being gay.

He said he had an argument with a female friend online, which prompted the older teen to begin threatening him.

They then verbally rowed when they accidentally met at the mall.

The 14-year-old was floored by the single punched and he says he was taunted by the older boy for being gay

Issaic said: 'Whenever he wanted to fight me he was calling me a queer and everything.'

He said after mall security told them both to leave, he and his friends walked towards the exit.

But unbeknown to him he was being filmed from behind and was then punched.

Friends of the older teen then posted the video online.

Issaic said: 'They said I got banned for fighting but I didn't even fight. I just got hit.'

MailOnline has contacted Coronado Mall for comment.
