A horrific gang-rape of six tourists in the famous resort of Acapulco was carried out by an armed gang who celebrated their horror attacks with mescal and spared one woman because she passed the 'nationality test'.

The Spanish women were raped in the holiday spot by five masked men in the early hours of Monday - tied with their bikini straps by their attackers who also tied up their partners so they couldn't intervene.

More details of the attack emerged as officials helped the victims - all from 
Mexico City - to leave Acapulco and return home reportedly 
under police protection yesterday.

Apology: Acapulco's mayor Luis Walton pledged to catch those responsible for the attack and apologized for saying it happens everywhere

Acapulco's mayor Luis Walton condemned the crime and promised to catch those responsible but was also forced to apologize today after saying such attacks happen 'everywhere in the world'.

'I apologize for having said that,' he said. 'Of course 
this worries us and we don't want anything like this to happen in 
Acapulco or anywhere else in the world.'

'We know this is going to affect our tourism.'

The incident happened in the early hours of Monday morning at Playa Bonfil just south of the city center.

The gang fled afterwards with their victims' valuables including cash, credit cards and mobile phones.

The women, aged between 30 and 32, were last night receiving counseling.

Guerrero state Attorney General Martha Garzon said the motive was "robbery, and to have fun' with the gang drinking mescal during the attack.

She added that the woman spared was allowed to go because of her nationality - despite the fact she was married to one of the Spanish men in the group.

'She says she identified herself to the (attackers) 
and asked not to be raped, and they told her that she had passed the 
test by being Mexican and they didn't touch her,' Garzon said according to CBS.

Acapulco is one of Mexico's oldest and most famous beach resorts but has declined in popularity in recent years over safety concerns

Acapulco is one of Mexico's oldest beach
 resorts and attracted Hollywood stars including Elizabeth Taylor, Frank
 Sinatra and Brigitte Bardot in the 1950s.

Ten Hollywood actors, led by John Wayne and former Tarzan Johnny Weissmuller bought a hotel in the resort and helped turned it into one of the most fashionable of its era.

Packed crowds have gathered on its cliff tops since the 1930s to watch professional divers plunge 130ft into the shallow waters of the Pacific.

Its reputation has been tarnished in recent years by the rival drugs cartels that have turned part of the city into no-go areas, although thousands of American teenagers still travel there for spring breaks every year.

Two Mexican tourists were injured on Saturday after trying to drive through a roadblock set up by locals who have formed self-defense groups to combat the drug-related violence.
