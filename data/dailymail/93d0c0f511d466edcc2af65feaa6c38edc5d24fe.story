A morgue left the corpse of a 95-year-old woman rotting in a freezer for a year after sending the wrong body to be cremated, it has emerged.

Leah Lehrer's family buried what they believed to be their relative's ashes in a cemetery in Queens, New York, days after she died on January 25.

But this week an inspector discovered Mrs Lehrer's decomposing body on the premises of the mortuary in midtown Manhattan - where bosses have spent months searching for a missing corpse.

Scandal: A New York City morgue left the body of Leah Lehrer, 95, in their freezer for a year after apparently sending that of Rebecca Alper, 71, to Mrs Lehrer's funeral

The discovery, reported in the New York Post, appears to confirm that the body of 71-year-old Rebecca Alper, who committed suicide in September 2013, was sent for cremation instead of Mrs Lehrer's.

However, the morgue's directors and city health officials have been unable to explain why the body was not sent for a city burial after three months, as it protocol with unclaimed corpses.

The scandal has sparked outrage and prompted an internal investigation of the Medical Examiner's Office as it happened after city officials paid $10.9 million in taxpayer money for new 'body-tracking' software.

Directors began to uncover the full scale of the mix-up in May when Rebecca Alper's family enquired about their relative's remains.

The Medical Examiner's Office exhumed 300 bodies buried on Hart Island in a desperate bid to find Mrs Alper's body, to no avail.

They have now delivered Mrs Lehrer's body to her family.

'We put the ashes in a package, dug a hole, said a prayer and put her in there,' first cousin Iris Familant told the Post.

'It's like she came back from the grave,' said another cousin, Joyce Liebman, also in an interview with the paper.
