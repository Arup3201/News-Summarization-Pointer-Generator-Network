The golf pro has struggled to recapture the form that led him to become one of the greatest players of all time.

He said in a statement: 'Right now, I need a lot of work on my game, and to still spend time with the people that are important to me.' 

'My play, and scores, are not acceptable for tournament golf. Like I've said, I enter a tournament to compete at the highest level, and when I think I'm ready, I'll be back.'

Vonn finished 27th in the first run of the giant slalom during ski championships

A four-time world champion and one of the most decorated female skiers, Vonn suffered from a set of injuries in the last two year

He added: 'I do, however, expect to be playing again very soon.' 

While his statement read as if he is taking an indefinite break from the sport, Woods said that he hopes to compete in his hometown Honda Classic in Florida on February 26.

He also said that his latest injury is not related to his previous surgery and that he has daily physical therapy. 

Woods said he is feeling better every day. 

As he watched on while his girlfriend competed, she finished 27th in the first run during Thursday's giant slalom race at the Alpine world ski championships.

The four-time world champion and one of the most decorated female skiers suffered from a set of injuries in the last two years, as she was previously side-lined following two serious knee surgeries.

During her second run, Vonn brought an aggression that was the fifth fastest in the world, according to the New York Times. 

Woods recorded the worst round of his career - an 11-over-par 82 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open (above during the tournament)

Woods and Vonn have been dating for two years and rumors have been swirling they could marry soon

And as her long-time boyfriend came out to watch her compete, there have been swirling rumors surrounding an upcoming marriage, according to the New York Daily News.

The sports celebrities, who appeared on the cover of US Weekly together with the headline 'In love with a sex addict' following Woods's sex addiction therapy after the downfall of his marriage, have been dating for two years.
