The seven men who gang-raped four women on August 23, stand trial in court in Kabul

They dragged four women out of the cars in the middle of the
night and raped them in the field near the main road. One of
them was pregnant. The victims were also beaten and their
jewellery and mobile phones stolen.

Crimes against women are common but mostly take place inside
homes in Afghanistan's conservative society.

But a gang rape by
armed men is rare in Kabul and has tapped into a vein of anxiety
as foreign troops leave the country and a badly stretched Afghan
army and police fight a deadly Taliban insurgency.

The case caused nationwide outrage and the court's proceedings were broadcast on live television

Judge Safihullah Mujadidi in a summary trial, televised nationwide, convicted the men of armed robbery and sexual assault.

'Based on criminal law these individuals are sentenced to
the severest punishment which is death sentence,' he said.

The men stood before him in a heavily guarded courtroom.
Outside dozens of activists gathered demanding speedy justice to
instil public confidence in law and order.

'This kind of gang rape is unprecedented in Kabul,' Kabul
police chief General Zahir earlier said in his testimony seeking
summary punishment for the men.

The assault has led to such outpouring of rage that
President Hamid Karzai told a delegation of women last week that
the perpetrators would face the death penalty.

The men can appeal Sunday's verdict in a higher court.
Karzai has to ratify the executions under Afghan law.

'If this act goes unpunished, the women of Afghanistan will
continue to be victims,' said Uma Saeed, a rights activist.

'This is really very significant moment, I would say, even maybe
in the history of Karzai's government.'
