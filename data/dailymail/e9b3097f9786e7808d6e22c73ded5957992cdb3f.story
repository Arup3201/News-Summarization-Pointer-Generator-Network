Costly: Silly mistakes before an MoT can cost a driver a huge amount, and together drivers could be saving £500,000 a year by fixing easily preventable failures

Motorists are wasting nearly £1/2million a year on 'daft' and unnecessary MoT test failures, a new report reveals.

It says drivers are allowing their car to fail its first MoT test 'for the most ridiculous reasons' including failing to clear out clutter and plastering stickers on the windscreen.

Research by Whatcar.com shows that nearly 1 in 25 (4 per cent) of the 285,236 MoT test failures recorded between August 2012 and August 2013 were on cars having their first test and so could have been easily avoided.

More than 4,600 cars failed because owners had not topped up the screen-wash, and nearly 2,900 failed due to the car being dirty and full of clutter.

It advises: 'Clear the mess from the boot and cabin and give the windows and mirrors a quick wipe'.

Nearly 1,400 MOT failures were down to 'anomalies' with the registration plate - particularly personalised plates - including incorrect fonts, irregular character spacings, and dirty or missing letters and plates.

What Car? says: 'If you have a personalised plate, make sure it adheres to DVLA rules.'

Some 1,055 cars failed because of stickers on windscreen blocking the driver's view.

The report urges: ' Keep any windscreen furniture, including tax disc and parking permits, strictly outside the area of the wipers' sweep'

And nearly 800 failed because of a warning light displaying on the dashboard.

What car? notes: 'Warning lights have been part of the MoT test since 2012 and relate to anything from brakes to tyre pressures and airbag. If you see one, get it checked out'.

Don't scrap it: Nearly 1,400 of mistakes were down to anomalies with registration plates. such as personalised plates and dirty or missing letters on the plates

With an average MoT test price of £45, the 10,753 cars which failed their first test amounts to £483,885 wasted by UK motorists.

The magazine has launched a new website www.whatcar.com/mot designed to help drivers boost their car's chances of passing its first MoT test.

Overall, the most common reasons overall for MoT failure are tyre tread depth being below the 1.6mm limit, brake-pads being worn down to less than 1.5mm thick and headlamps being wrongly aimed.
