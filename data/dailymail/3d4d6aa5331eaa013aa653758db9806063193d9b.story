Nobody likes paying a toll fee to cross a river, but these days there's not much you can do but take a deep breath and pay up.

Not this skinflint driver in China. He was so determined to get out of paying the fee to cross the frozen Yellow River, in Ordos, Inner Mongolia, that he just drove straight onto the ice.

He negotiated the frozen body of water gingerly at first, but grew in confidence as he realised he would make the crossing - saving himself some 50p in the process.

The ice is right: Onlookers watched in horror as the unidentified driver risked his life just to save pennies, gasping each time they heard the ice creak under the weight of the silver-coloured car

It took the curmudgeonly commuter a whole ten minutes to cross the 1km-wide body of water before revving his engine with satisfaction as he drove up the bank on the other side.

The nearest road crossing would have been the Jingsang Expressway which runs into the ghost city of Ordos. Tolls are common in China and are usually collected as one-off payments, of between 5 and ten yuan (50p to £1), or through a top-up card system charged on distance travelled between certain gates.

The 5,464-km-long Yellow River runs through nine Chinese provinces and two autonomous regions, emptying into the Bohai Sea, in Shandong Province in east China.

Nearly there! It took the curmudgeonly commuter a whole ten minutes to cross the 1km-wide body of water before revving his engine with satisfaction as he drove up the bank on the other side

The Yellow River originates in the 
Bayan Har Mountains and the Anemaqen Mountains and empties into the 
Bohai Sea drain into the Hai River.

It is also difficult to imagine from 
these pictures that at the early sections of the river the water runs 
crystal clear, flowing steadily and forming mirror-like lakes, including
Lake Zhaling and Lake Eling, at the foot of the mountains.

Subsequently, the Mongolian name for the river in this section is the Black River.

However, further downstream, the 
epithet 'Yellow' River earns its name, as it collects rich silt  
containing golden-coloured minerals.
