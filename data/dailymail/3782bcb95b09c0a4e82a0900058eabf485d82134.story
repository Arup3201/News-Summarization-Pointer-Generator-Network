Canadian scientists have discovered artificial sweeteners in water samples collected from the Grand River in Ontario.

The sweeteners - found in everything from diet soda to flavored yoghurts - pass through waste-water treatment systems and are then discharged into waterways.

In other words: humans consume them, expel them, and they wind up in our waterways.

Sweet nothings: Artificial sweeteners are used in low-calorie foods and sodas as a sugar alternative but they persist through sewage treatment and wind up in rivers and waterways

The researchers write in a paper published on PLOS ONE that the sweeteners got into the Grand River from the 30 sewage treatment plants that empty into the river and its tributaries.

The Researchers, from Environment Canada and the University of Waterloo sampled the Grand River at 23 separate locations along more than 150 miles of its course.

They found concentrations of four sweeteners: cyclamate, saccarin, sucralose and acesulfame, the last of which is particularly resistant to removal.

The scientists say its very persistance and the fact that it comes solely from human waste makes acesulfame a good candidate for tracing the movement of treated sewage after it is expelled into rivers and waterways.

'Given the persistent nature demonstrated here and solely human source, we expect that acesulfame will become the most reliable detector of wastewater presence, dilution, and transformation in surface and ground waters,' write the researchers.

The researchers write that the concentrations they measured for sucralose, cyclamate, and saccharin are the 'highest reported concentrations of these compounds in surface waters anywhere in the world.'

And acesulfame persists at elevated concentrations over a distance of 300km.

Having survived the sewage treatment plants, the compounds also persisted through water purification to be found in trace amounts in municipal tap water from homes that draw water from the River Grand.

Traceable: The persistence of artificial sweeteners means they're a good way to trace where waste water ends up

The researchers say the effects of artificial sweeteners on aquatic life are largely unknown.

But, they write, 'We demonstrate here that aquatic organisms likely experience long-term exposure to significant concentrations' of artificial sweeteners if they reside downriver from water impacted by urban activities.

The report is just part of a growing body of evidence that the chemicals humans ingest - anti-depressants, sweeeteners, antibiotics and many other prescription drugs - wind up in our waterway and drinking supplies.

So far, researchers are unsure of the longterm effects for humans and the environment are.
