'The One-77' sterling silver bottle cooler

What on earth is a carbon fibre and sterling silver The One-77 bottle cooler, I hear you cry?

It's a wine bucket to you and me - a £17,750 one!

So what exactly justifies such a large price tag for something a lot of us have made redundant in favour of a fridge?

The lining is reminiscent of a car tyre (a nod to the Aston Martin brand), and it's made by hand at silversmiths Grant Macdonald as part of a silverwear collection, Silver by Aston Martin. It is just one of  77 made.

Bearing all of this in mind, £17,750 is still a hefty amount to spend on a decent car, let alone a wine bucket. Though we have a sneaking suspicion that this may be different in the world of Aston Martin.

After all this isn't the first bumper price household object that has received the Aston Martin treatment.

Last year the motoring manufacture launched a whole range of products to be sold in London's famous department store, Harrods.

Products included the £2,000 Aston Martin pram in partnership between the luxury Silver Cross, another British brand which first began designing carriages for babies in 1877.

Aston Martin touches included the Alcantara lined seat pad - a high quality and expensive suede manufactured in Italy - to the super soft leather-trimmed handle and bumper bar.

The Aston Martin pram is sold for £2,000 with only 800 models made

The design of the aluminium alloy wheels 
is based on the Aston Martin One-77, which retails for £1.2 million. And
 once again you were buying exclusivity with only 800 being sold in 
Harrods.

So what's next? An Aston Martin foot spa? An Aston Martin dish washer? The possibilities are endless especially if you consider the fact that products such as the as the Aston Martin espresso cup and the Aston Martin Picnic Hamper are some of the current design options at Silver by Aston Martin.

The Aston Martin seven piece dining set by Grant Macdonald retails at £5,440

Grant Macdonald, co-creator of Silver by Aston Martin, told Director Magazine that out of all the pieces he'd helped to create the bottle cooler was the one he was most proud of.

'The ice bucket I created for them is one of my favourite designs. I wanted to make a shape nobody else had ever seen and incorporate carbon fibre, which is a material used in Aston Martin cars. The bucket takes 60 hours of silversmithing to create and 10 hours to polish.

Some of the cheaper pieces include the £140 Espresso Cups by Grant Macdonald for Aston Martin

'I think the Aston Martin brand will give us a great future. It's their 100th anniversary next year so I'm sure we'll be involved in lots of exciting projects.'

If your price range doesn't quite stretch to the wine cooler the Aston Martin Carbon Dining China Side plate is the cheapest in the collection coming in at a snip of £60. However, if you're feeling a little more extravagant you could go for the wine cooler's 24 carat gold plated sister at a cool £22,750.
