The Labour leadership today avoided an embarrassing stand-off with their union paymasters after a motion criticising their support for public sector pay freezes was watered down.

Ed Miliband and Ed Balls risked humiliation, when a motion condemned their support for the government curbs on wage rises.

But after a backroom deal, the motion was torn up and replaced with one merely 'noting' the policy, although angry union leaders ratcheted up their rhetoric against the party's leaders.

Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, told delegates that workers wanted hope from their leaders, not 'economic lectures which simply justify a Tory agenda'.

Len McCluskey, general secretary of 
the Unite union which has given almost £7million to Labour in the last 
two years, claimed his members were ‘furious’ at the Labour leaderships 
‘crazy’ policy of supporting pay restraint.

He told Mr Miliband: 'A public spending squeeze while the City continues to let rip is simply not acceptable.

'It is time for Labour to once and for all turn its back on the neo-liberalism of the past.

'Reject the siren voices from those whose policies and philosophy have been discredited, and embrace the radical alternative the country wants, which is the only way - the only way Labour will return to power.'

Mr Miliband – dubbed ‘Red Ed’ for his 
closeness to the unions when he became leader two years ago – is now 
being forced to defend the government’s policy of not increasing the 
wages state workers at a time of spending cuts.

The row threatenened to overshadow today’s keynote speech by Mr Balls, who today claimed the ‘vast majority’ of union members back his strategy.

GMB leader Paul Kenny today targeted Mr Balls with a four-page report on Mr Balls which he said was aimed at highlighting his call for the Labour leadership to connect with ordinary workers.

'We have to make sure that the public face of the party can connect with the public and that they are not damaged or dented by past mistakes which have not been owned up to.'

But today Mr Balls, who was booed when the addressed the TUC last month, insisted it was not his job to be popular.

‘What people want is a unified Labour Party taking the argument to the country against a coalition Government which is divided and failing and that's what I'm going to do.

‘It's not my job as shadow chancellor to make everybody happy. My job is to make sure that we've got strong, credible policies which add up and make sense and are costed.'

One union leader said Ed Balls would 'give an aspirin a headache'

He tried to turn the row to his advantage, adding: ‘If people see some trade union leaders having a go at me because I am saying we have got to be disciplined on spending, tough on pay, put jobs first, rebuild this country and kick-start our recovery for the future, I think most people would say that's what we'd expect from the Labour leadership and that's what we are going to deliver.’

Unite is now hoping to mobilise hundreds of thousands of people to march against the cuts on October 20.

A motion by the Unison union had called on the conference to ‘condemn’ the pay freeze which has hit millions of public sector workers.

But in an attempt to spare the leadership embarrassment, the wording was watered down to ‘note’ the pay freeze.

It condemns the fact that most of the lowest paid have not received a promised £250 pay rise.

Later Mr Balls called for the £3billion raised by selling off 4G mobile phone licences to be used to build 100,000 affordable homes and offer a stamp duty tax break for first-time buyers.

But there is still confusion about whether Labour will commit to the coalition's spending plans, and whether any of the spending pledges made this week will still be policy by the time of the 2015 election.

Labour has announced promises to break up the banks, reverse the cut in the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p and spend billions on new homes.

But Mr Balls told BBC News: 'I can make no commitment now to reverse any of those cuts or the tax rises, because we don’t know what economy’s going to be like in two months time, let alone in two years’ time when the election comes.

'I’m going to say today we will have a zero budget review when we look at every pound that is spent and say ‘is it being spent well, can we make the savings’, that’s what I think people would expect us to say.'
