An Idaho criminal, who replaced an 'Aryan Warrior' forehead tattoo with words 'Irish Thug,' a shamrock and several other facial inkings, has been arrested.

Jesse Starkey, 32, was originally charged with assault in 2007 after chasing his roommates with a chair before drink driving and almost hitting a pedestrian.

At the time of the original arrest, the Boise local had the words 'Aryan Warrior' tattooed across his forehead in a neo-Gothic font, making clear his views on race and violence.

On Thursday, Jesse Starkey was arrested again with additional inkings that completely cover his face and ears. The original 'Aryan Warrior' tattoo is only faintly visible now, and is covered by a new inking which reads 'Irish Thug.' 

Starkey who carried a fuller face his first mugshot, appears slimmer in his latest picture. 

Other standout tattoos include, the abbreviation FTW, which often stands for F*** The World on his right ear lobe, 'Stay Gold' above his eyes, spider webs on his nose, and Boise - his hometown tattooed on his left cheek.

According to Boise Weekly, Starkey faced misdemeanor charges for assault and for vehicular assault in the summer of 2007. After breaking his parole, officers pulled him over in July after he crashed into a curb and almost took out a passerby. He then refused to take a breathalyzer test. Starkey is being held at the Ada County Sheriff jail in Boise.
