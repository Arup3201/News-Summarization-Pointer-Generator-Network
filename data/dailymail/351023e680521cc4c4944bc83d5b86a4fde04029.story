A Florida special education teacher died Monday in childbirth just after bringing her fourth child into the world after opting to carry him to term, a decision she knew had the potential to kill her. 

Suzanne Mazzola, who suffered from a sever form of a condition called placenta accreta, gave birth to a healthy son named Owen via Cesarean. Emergency surgery followed, but even a team of 15 doctors couldn't save the 34-year-old.

Now her friends and family have crowd funded tens of thousands to help her grieving husband and children in their time of need.

Sad: Suzanne Mazzola, who suffered from a sever form of a condition called placenta accreta, gave birth to a healthy son named Owen via Cesarean. Emergency surgery followed, but even a team of 15 doctors couldn't save the 34-year-old

Bereaved: Several fundraisers have already raised over $60K for Mazzola's husband Joe and their four children

Left behind are Suzanne's husband Joe and their children Matteo, 7, Ella, 5, Luca, 2 and Owen. Just days after Suzanne's death, members of their Tamarac community have already raised over $60,000 for the family.

On just one of several crowdfunding sites set up for the family--a YouCaring page that by Sunday evening had raised an impressive $59,753 of a goal of $100,000--Suzanne's aunt Janet writes: 

'We all said our goodbyes with smiling faces, never imagining it would be the last time we would see her.'

According to Janet, doctors told Suzanne she could deliver Owen early--itself a risky proposition for the baby--but she refused.

'Being the wonderful strong woman and mother that she was and understanding the personal risk, she chose to wait until 35 weeks when the baby would be strong enough to survive,' Janet writes.

That decision ultimately cost Suzanne her life, while it potentially saved Owen's.  

Suzanne was rushed into surgery following the delivery. With placenta accreta, the placental blood vessels grow too deeply into the mother's uterus and sometimes into surrounding organs.

Giving birth with the condition is usually followed by the removal of the uterus and surgery to stop any hemorrhaging that can occur as the blood vessels are severed.

In Suzanne's case, the heroic efforts of a team of 15 doctors at Memorial Hospital in Hollywood were unable to save her and she died in surgery. 

Life threatening: Suzanne suffered from a condition called placenta accreta in which the blood vessels of the placenta grow too deeply into the uterus, causing life threatening hemorrhaging at childbirth 

Suzanne knew the risks but chose to carry the baby to term in order to ensure he'd be born healthy

Suzanne Mazzola died after childbirth because of a serious case of a condition known as placenta accreta, which affects as many as 1 in 533 pregnant women--and can be fatal in as many as 7 percent of those affected.

The Mayo Clinic defines placenta accreta as:

A serious pregnancy condition that occurs when blood vessels and other parts of the placenta grow too deeply into the uterine wall...

Typically, the placenta detaches from the uterine wall after childbirth. With placenta accreta, part or all of the placenta remains strongly attached. This can cause vaginal bleeding during the third trimester of pregnancy and severe blood loss after delivery.

It's also possible for the placenta to invade the muscles of the uterus (placenta increta) or grow through the uterine wall (placenta percreta).

If extensive placenta accreta is suspected during pregnancy, you'll likely need a C-section delivery followed by the surgical removal of your uterus (hysterectomy).

Despite the risks, no one expected to lose Suzanne.

'She often mentioned how scared she was,' her co-worker Grace Duran told the Sun-Sentinel. 'We always told her to have faith and be positive. But we never thought this would be the outcome.' 

And with any such terrible turn of events, the family was left unprepared for the fallout, as Suzanne's aunt Janet writes.

'We never think the worst will happen and don't plan well enough for something like this. Suzanne’s four children and husband Joe need our support, as there isn’t any financial safety net. Please honor Suzanne by helping support her family in their time of need.'

Suzanne's aunt Janet is helping raise thousands to help out the family. The last time she and many others saw the 34-year-old was at her baby shower (pictured). 'We all said our goodbyes with smiling faces, never imagining it would be the last time we would see her,' Janet said
