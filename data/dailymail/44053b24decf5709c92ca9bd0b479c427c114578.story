Former Rangers manager Ally McCoist is looking to return to management in England and was considered for the post at Aston Villa before Tim Sherwood was appointed.

McCoist, 52, has decided to make himself available for other jobs even though he is guaranteed being paid by Rangers until the end of the year.

The Ibrox legend handed in his notice as manager there after he learned about other staff losing their jobs, and Rangers placed him on 12 months gardening leave in December.

Aston Villa were made aware of his availability following last week's sacking of Paul Lambert and McCoist was on their shortlist as an alternative before Sherwood was appointed on Saturday.

Ironically, the Scot – also popular as a long-time captain television quiz show A Question of Sport – is earning more money at Rangers now than when he did work.

In 2013, he voluntarily took a 50% pay cut on his £800,000-a-year wages to help the club get over their financial problems, but that no longer applies.

However, despite being able to sit and collect the money without working, McCoist is actively looking to continue his managerial career as soon as possible and is casting his eyes south of the border.

He scored 396 goals in a glittering playing career for St Johnstone, Sunderland, Rangers, Kilmarnock and Scotland and returned to Ibrox as manager in 2011.

However, McCoist had to contend with ownership battles off-the-pitch for the majority of his time in charge.

Ironically, his link to Villa comes at a time when there are no Scottish managers in the top-flight of English football for the first time since 1984.

If McCoist was to take up a Premier League job, he would be the only Scottish manager in the top flight
