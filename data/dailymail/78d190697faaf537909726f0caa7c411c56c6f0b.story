The Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) is encouraging lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGB&T) couples to research and choose their overseas honeymoon destinations carefully. 

The introduction of the government's ' Know Before You Go' campaign comes after a survey conducted by OnePoll found that less than half (46 per cent) of LGB&T people investigate whether an area is LGB&T-friendly when planning a honeymoon abroad.

Legislation to allow same-sex marriage was put into effect in England, Scotland, and Wales just six months ago.

The Foreign Office has launched the 'Know Before You Go' campaign - encouraging LGB&T couples to research their honeymoon destination carefully

The FCO hopes that this campaign will inspire couples to research their trips thoroughly before booking - ensuring that their honeymoon is the trip of a lifetime.

One-third of respondents revealed that while they have happy memories of their honeymoon, their experience had been affected by negative location attitudes.

Survey findings also revealed that 52 per cent didn't feel confident in selecting a destination overseas guaranteed to be LGB&T-friendly, but that those aged 18-24 were most likely to do some research beforehand.

When choosing a honeymoon destination, couples revealed that their primary sources of information are media, LGB&T organisations, family, and friends.

John Heppenstall, Head of Consular Campaigns, said: 'All couples looking to book and travel abroad for their honeymoon have an abundance of great destinations to choose from.'

'But it's important for same-sex couples to be aware that attitudes toward lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender travellers vary considerably around the world and can be very different from those in the UK.' 

In some countries, same sex relationships may be punishable by a long imprisonment or the death penalty. 

'Our most important piece of advice is to always fully research your destination before booking,' John continued.

'It could be the difference between the trip of a lifetime and one you'd both much rather forget.'

Martin Iverson Christensen, European Member of the Board of The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA), agrees: 'It's easy to get caught up in the excitement of booking a holiday abroad, especially for a special occasion like a honeymoon.'

'But finding out how suitable a destination is should be a priority, so we welcome the initiative by the FCO to publish travel advice for LBTI-people,' he said.

'The ILGA monitors the legislation concerning LGBTI-people closely and our website can give an indication if, for instance, same sex marriage is recognised, or if, on the contrary, being gay or lesbian is considered a crime.'
