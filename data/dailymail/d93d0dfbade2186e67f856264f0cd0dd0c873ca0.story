Distraught: Murdered Lee Rigby's widow Rebecca said his family have been comforted by the huge amount of public support they have been shown

An outpouring of support and goodwill from around the world has comforted murdered fusilier Lee Rigby’s family since his death.

Ahead of a private funeral in Bury, Greater Manchester, today, his widow, mother and stepfather spoke movingly about how they hoped the ceremony would confound his killers’ intentions by celebrating him as a ‘hero’ and ‘martyr’.

Fusilier Rigby, 25, a drummer in the 2nd
Battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was killed as he returned to 
Woolwich barracks from the Tower of London on May 22.

The father of one had served in 
Afghanistan and was attached to the regimental recruiting team when he 
was hacked to death in broad daylight on a street in south London.

The
horrific killing led to nationwide shock and revulsion and Lee's 
funeral today is expected to be attended by hundreds of mourners following a 
groundswell of support for his family from the public.

They
said the letters of support - including from mosques - showed the unity
amongst all communities against the senseless act of murder.

Fighting
back tears throughout, his 30-year-old wife Rebecca said: ‘We have had 
an awful lot of support from across the world. It has been overwhelming.

‘We
have had masses of cards, letters and donations from everywhere. It’s 
unbelievable, really, the things that have been coming in. 

Overwhelming: Rebecca Rigby said Lee's family have received support from across the political spectrum and groups of all faiths

Good wishes: A selection of some of the heartfelt cards sent to Lee Rigby's family

Affection: A beautiful letter and drawing sent from nine-year-old Nicole Hanson

Comforts: Rebecca told of how she was given a £10 cheque by a stranger to buy something 'to put a smile on Jack's face'

Proud father: The family of Lee Rigby, pictured holding his son Jack, say they want him to be remembered as a 'fun-loving lad'

‘We have had letters from the Prime 
Minister, from senior politicians from all parties, the Duke of Kent, 
from the Sikh community.

‘Various large mosques and interfaith groups have been in touch with letters of condolences and such.’

His mother Lyn, 46, added: ‘We have received overwhelming support from the public, friends, family.

‘We have had thousands of cards, with kind words. That basically has given us the strength to get through this time.’

His stepfather Ian, 54, said the support showed how the motives behind his murder could be defeated.

‘Whatever the intention was, it’s backfired because it’s made Lee into the hero and the martyr,’ he said.

‘And the support and the unity through
the country... we have been having phone calls or letters off mosques, 
off Jewish sections, every religion you can think of and not just in 
this country.

‘The country is united, whatever elements may wish to stop it. It’s not working because it’s working the other way.’

Never forget: Lee's mother Lyn and step-father Ian say they want his funeral to be a celebration of his life

Unbowed: Ian and Lyn Rigby, both pictured, said Lee has become a 'hero' and a 'martyr'

Support: The couple said they have received cards and letters of condolence from all over the world

Mr
Rigby said the family wanted today’s funeral to be a celebration of his
life. ‘Lee was a fun-loving lad and that is how he should be 
remembered,’ he said.

‘We
would like today a certain amount of respect and dignity, but we would 
like it to be Lee’s day and Lee remembered as how he was.

‘We don’t want everybody crying and getting heartbroken. We would rather enjoy Lee’s memories as he was with us.’

His widow said his own wishes had been for a funeral ceremony that was a remembrance of his life.

A sad day: Lee Rigby's coffin arrived at Bury parish church ahead of an all-night vigil on the eve of the Fusilier's funeral

Poignant: The hearse was proceeded by a drummer corp and soldiers bowed their head as the procession went passed

Military honours: A marching band proceeded the funeral cortege as it made its way towards the church

‘He wanted people to enjoy that and 
sit and talk about happy days and happy memories they have got of Lee 
and the things he used to do and say because he was always so full of 
life,’ she said.

‘He just wanted to put a smile on everyone’s face.’

Speaking
publicly for the first time since an emotional Press conference shortly
after his death, Fusilier Rigby’s widow also spoke of the kindness of 
total strangers towards their two-year-old son, Jack.

His wife Rebecca Rigby struggled to hold back her tears as she carried their son Jack and followed his coffin

The soldier's mother Lyn Rigby and stepfather Ian arrived at the vigil yesterday wearing bright red poppies

‘I
was handed £1.10, two 50p coins and a 10p piece, that had been handed 
over by somebody at the Tower of London,’ she said. ‘It was requested 
that it be passed on to the soldier’s son’s money.

‘And
I have had a cheque off another lady. She sent me a lovely letter and a
cheque for £10 asking me to buy something to put a smile on Jack’s 
face.

‘He wanted a scooter so we got him a scooter which he absolutely loves.’ She added: ‘There are so many kind and generous people out there. It’s just horrible that it takes something such as this to make you see how many good people there are.’

Fusilier Rigby’s mother said her ‘fun-loving’ son had ‘fulfilled his dreams’ by serving in the Army.

‘He had a heart of gold. He wouldn’t hurt anybody.' Her husband added: ‘He was a devoted soldier. He loved what he was doing. He believed in what he was doing but he was still a family man.’

A guard of honour remained with Fusilier Rigby's body overnight inside the church, ahead of his funeral
