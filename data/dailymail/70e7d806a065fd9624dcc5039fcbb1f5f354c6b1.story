Coca-Cola and Pepsi retained their positions as the most respected brands in the newly released 2014 CoreBrand's survey.

Every year the CoreBrand's consulting firm polls 10,000 corporate executives to find the country's leading brands.

The brands are then ranked by how familiar they are, how favorably people view them, their management, and investment potential.

traded and tracked by CoreBrand for over five years. They must also have a corporate brand.

The poll begins with 500 companies for consideration then cuts it down to the 100 brands that have the highest familiarity.

Both Coke and Pepsi polled highly, though how favorably people perceive them has dipped in recent years as many now view their products as contributing to obesity, Fortune reports.

Rounding out the top ten were Hershey, Bayer, Johnson & Johnson, Harley-Davidson, IBM, Apple, Kellogg, and General Electric.

Apple's ranking was of particular interest since CEO Tim Cook is still under pressure to see if he can match the performance of late co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs.

Ironically, thought Family Dollar was ranked among the least respected companies simply becoming a recognized brand is considered something of a milestone by the company itself.

'It is actually a counter-intuitive that they even show up here, as 
their brand is becoming more powerful year over year,' the report notes.

However it could be more recognized because of headlines last year regarding the brand's sluggish sales.

Assuming they focus on their public perception, the brand should be able to remove itself from the list.

Appearing for the second year in the lest respected spot was Delta Airlines.

J.C. Penney was also ranked poorly, as the company's image was damaged two years ago in an attempt to reinvent themselves as a more upscale brand.

They have since reverted to their prior identity in stores, but their favorability rating hovers at 60 per cent.

Also on the bottom of the list were Denny's, H&R Block, Big Lots, Best Buy, Rite Aid, Capital One Financial, and Sprint Nextel.
