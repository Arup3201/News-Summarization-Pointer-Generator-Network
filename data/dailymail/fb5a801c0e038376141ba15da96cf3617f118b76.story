The Widower: Thomas Sapienza formerly worked as a laborer for the City of Lawrence's DPW in Lawrence, Massachusetts

A Massachusetts municipal worker says he is going to sue his former employer because the city fired him after he requested time off to comfort his terminally-ill wife during her final days.

Thomas Sapeniza of Lawrence, Massachusetts, a Boston suburb, was reportedly initially granted unpaid leave to care for his spouse of eight years, Heather, who was stricken with brain cancer.

However, by the time of Heather's death on Jan. 3 at the age of 40, Sapienza had already been sacked from his post with the city's Department of Public Works, for whom he toiled as a laborer.

'Heather couldn't even have the peace during the last 30 days of her life knowing that her husband could have a job to go back to,' Michael Sweeney, an ex-elected official in Lawrence told WHDH.com.

Making matters worese, Lawrence officials apparently filled Sapienza's one-time position through political patronage.

Now responsible for widower's former duties is a one-time Massachusetts state official who reportedly not only has no experience as a laborer, but is currently incarcerated.

Jose Santiago, a former state representative, was arrested Saturday for violating a restraining order. 

'They confirmed that the arrest warrant was still active and he was taken into custody,'Lawrence Police Chief John Romero told the Channel 7News and WHDH.com.

'He was brought back here to the station and was charged with violation of a restraining order.'

Sapienza's lawyer reportedly feels Santiago’s credentials were lacking from the start.

The former rep not only has no laboring experience but his driver’s license is currently suspended, attorney Ellen Shimer-Brenes told WHDH.com.

Fighting Back: Sapienza is preparing to file a reverse discrimination suit against the city, as his attorney says this never would have happened if Tom was a minority

But Sapienza, now mired in debt, is fighting back by reportedly preparing a soon-to-be-filed reverse racial discrimination lawsuit with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination.

'We firmly believe that if Tom Sapienza was Hispanic and not white that he will have a job to come back to with the city of Lawrence,' Shimer-Brenes reportedly said.

The Massachusetts station phoned the DPW, as well as City of Lawrence officials, but received no return calls.

Sapienza reportedly used up his vacation and sick time in caring for Heather and then requested unpaid sick time to be with his wife during her final days.

The one-time municipal laborer reportedly did not qualify for the Family and Medical Leave Act because he had not worked the requisite number of hours.
