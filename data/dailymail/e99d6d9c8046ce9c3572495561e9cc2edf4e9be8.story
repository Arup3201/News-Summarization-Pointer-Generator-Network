Britain is to sign off taxpayer-funded ‘propaganda’ to promote the virtues European Union despite growing calls to quit Brussels altogether.

Tory MPs had called on David Cameron to bring forward legislation in today’s Queen’s Speech for his promised in-out referendum.

But instead, buried in the small print, was a plan for the UK to authorise the Europe for Citizens scheme which aims to ‘develop understanding of the EU’.

David Cameron, pictured walking from the Commons to the Lords today, is under pressure to take a tougher line on Europe to see off the threat posed by UKIP

There was no mention of Europe in the speech delivered by the Queen to MPs and peers.

The Tories are under pressure after the recent rise of the UK Independence Party culminating in them taking almost one in four votes in last week’s local elections.

Mr Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU before staging an in-out referendum by 2017, if he is Prime Minister after the next election.

But his strategy was blown apart yesterday when former Chancellor Lord Lawson said he would vote to leave the EU.

Slipped into the detail of the government’s legislation plans for the next year was the European Union Approvals Bill.

There was no mention of Europe in the Queen's Speech, despite the issue threatening to split the Tory party and destablise the coalition

The Queen's Speech contained several measures designed to address concerns raised by UKIP, including tackling immigration

Described as a ‘minor technical Bill’,
it provides authorisation for the UK ‘to support measures and 
programmes in the European Union’.

Among
three programmes listed, it includes Europe for Citizens which 
according to government briefing notes ‘aims to develop understanding of
the EU, its history and policy-making processes and encourage civic 
participation in the EU’.

It also aims to ‘promote remembrance of Europe’s history, particularly the wars and totalitarian regimes of the 20th century’.

The
scheme, which has a 229 million euro budget for 2014-20, claims that 
most Europeans 'generally recognise the benefits of the EU' and 'want to
see the Union becoming a more integral part of their national political
landscapes'.

By enshrining the Europe for Citizens scheme into British law, the UK will be able to apply for funds

It aims to increase trust in EU institutions, potentially reaching 5million people across the continent.

The
revelation is likely to infuriate Tory MPs demanding Mr Cameron take a 
tougher line with Brussels instead of backing a scheme which promotes 
it.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage
said: ‘Hidden beneath the folds of froth Cameron offers a Bill to 
approve UK taxpayer spending on EU propaganda.

‘He
promises that he wants to fight Britain’s corner, but spends our money 
propagandising on the EU's behalf to our children. By his acts not his 
words he must be known.’

UKIP leader Nigel Farage accused the government of backing EU 'propaganda'

A government source said the scheme needed to be passed into UK law so that ministers can apply for funding from a £200million central pot available to all EU states.

Britain would apply for money to pay for projects such as the commemoration for centenary of the outbreak of World War One, not promoting the EU, the source added.

Some of the key measures announced in the Queen's Speech were seen as a reaction to the rise of UKIP.

In particular, the government promised a crackdown on illegal immigration in the Queen's Speech today as concern about the impact of new arrivals to Britain hit a three-year high.

Rogue firms who rent homes and give jobs to illegal immigrants face tougher fines in an immigration crackdown unveiled today in the Queen's Speech.

The latest YouGov survey showed 57 per cent of people named immigration as being among the top three issues facing the country, its highest level since June 2010 and up 11 per cent on a year ago.

Other flagship bills will cut red-tape to boost business, create a new flat-rate pension worth around £140-a-week, cap the costs of social care to stop families having to sell their homes to pay for elderly relatives to be looked after.

The Queen told MPs and peers that the government’s first priority is to strengthen Britain’s economic competitiveness.’

This includes building a stronger economy, rewarding people who work hard and tackling the deficit to keep interest rates low.

The controversial High Speed Rail line linking London to Birmingham, and then Leeds and Manchester, will move a step closer with two Bills which will ‘provide further opportunities for economic growth in many of Britain’s cities’, the Queen said.

The National Insurance costs for every company will be cut by £2,000, under plans first announced by George Osborne in the Budget. The move will mean 450,000 employers will pay no NI contributions at all. The government also promises to cut the burden of red tape, helping companies to grow and take on more staff.

A Pensions Bill will create a flat-rate pension of around £140-a-week from 2016. Under the plan, years spent away from work looking after children or caring for elderly relatives will count towards a person’s final pension value.

On crime and justice, there will be tougher action against anti-social behaviour, including scrapping the Asbo whole offender rehabilitation and new rules on controlling dangerous dogs. On defence there will be reform of the way the Ministry of Defence agrees multi-billion pound equipment deals.
