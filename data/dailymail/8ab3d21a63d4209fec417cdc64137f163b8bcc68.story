The Princeton Review, a prominent test prep company, produced a guide telling college applicants to play up or play down their ethnicity

The Princeton Review, a test preparation and college admission service, produced a guide telling college applicants to play up or play down their ethnicity according to their race.

An eight-page section called 'Ethnic Background' advises prospective students who are black, Hispanic, or Asian on the types of topics they should bring up.

The coaching was first published by Random House in 1992 in Cracking College Admissions, and most recently updated in 2004, reports Business Week.

Black applicants were told to 'make sure the admissions committee knows you're black' by including a photograph.

It states: 'Selective colleges have less stringent requirements for black applicants.'

The book advises that Asian Americans 'you need to avoid being an Asian Joe Bloggs.'

It states this is Asian American applicant 'with a very high math SAT score, a low or mediocre verbal SAT score, very high math-or science-related SATII score, high maths and science grades, few credits in the humanities, few extracurricular activities, an intended major in math or the sciences, and an ambition to be a doctor, an engineer or as a research scientist.'

Asian students are told not to attach a photo to their application - but they are advised if they have an 'Asian-sounding surname but aren't Asian, do attach a photograph.'

The guide states: 'Do not write your application essay about the importance of your family or the positive/negative aspect of living in two cultures. 

'These are Asian Joe Bloggs topics, and they are incredibly popular. Instead, write about something entirely unrelated to your ethnic background.'

Hispanic students are simply told 'in general, the guidelines for African Americans apply to you.'

'If you have a Hispanic surname (because your father is from Chile, say) but you don’t come from a disadvantaged background, don’t answer the ethnic-background question on your application,' it reads.

The book, which is now out of print, is still available in at least 76 libraries nationwide, reports Business Insider.

It can also still be bought from third-party sellers on Amazon.com and at Barnes & Noble.

New Princeton Review books do not include similar advice. 

'The Princeton Review's advice to all students applying to colleges is this: Get great grades, get great test scores, and find your 'best fit' college,' said Rob Franek, Princeton Review's senior vice president for publishing, in a statement.
