In her heyday she helped destroy a German battleship, supported the D-Day landings and survived a blast from an enemy mine.

But HMS Belfast sank without trace this week when she was airbrushed out of official London Olympic posters because she ‘got in the way’.

Veterans expressed their disgust at the step yesterday, saying it insulted the memory of those who died in the war in the run-up to Remembrance Sunday and reflected embarrassment at our military past.

The Mail understands designers removed Britain’s largest historic vessel from an aerial photograph of London because it ‘obscured’ the white lettering on one of seven posters. But HMS Belfast was then deleted – accidentally, it is claimed – from all of them.

It is thought as many as 200 of the posters were put up around London, including on the Tube, before being hastily removed.

Falklands veteran Commander John Muxworthy said: ‘It is barking. The Navy helped develop the British Empire and HMS Belfast has contributed to that greatness. It cannot just be airbrushed out.’

Martyn Heighton, director of National Historic Ships, which advises the government on the preservation of such vessels, said: ‘It is unbelievable. HMS Belfast does not get in the way of anything, certainly not the design of a poster. Graphics should be worked around her.’

The posters were to promote the London 2012 Festival, which runs alongside the Olympic and Paralympic Games and will, ironically, celebrate Britain’s cultural heritage.

The Olympic organisers Locog apologised last night but insisted  it was a ‘simple mistake in the advertising production process’. But Colonel Richard Kemp, former Commander of British Forces in Afghanistan and founder of the  UK National Defence Association, said: ‘You do not do that kind of thing by accident.

‘At best, this is very bad judgment, at worst, a deliberate decision to remove it because of some sense of embarrassment about Britain’s military history.’

Sir James Eberle, a former Supreme 
Commander of Nato and Commander-in-chief of the British fleet who served
on HMS Belfast, said: ‘This shows complete contempt for veterans, 
especially just days from Remembrance Sunday.

‘It is part of a worrying trend of trying to completely remove wars and fighting from our history.’

Fred Wooding, of the HMS Belfast Association, who also served on the ship, said the apparent removal of the ship was an ‘insult to the people who served their country’.

He added: ‘Without HMS Belfast there wouldn’t be an Olympic Games in London. They would be in Berlin. Coming just days before Remembrance Sunday, it is particularly dreadful.’

HMS Belfast was launched in 1938 and played a vital role in the Second World War, taking part in the sinking of the battleship Scharnhorst in 1943 and supporting the Normandy landings. She also saw service in the Korean War.

She was retired in 1963 and has been moored on the Thames as a visitor attraction since 1971.

Outraged: Sir James Eberle, a former gunnery officer on HMS Belfast who then went on to become Commander-in-chief of the British fleet

Work
on HMS Belfast began in 1936 amid fears over the growing military 
strength of Nazi Germany and she was launched in March 1938.

Just
over a year later she struck a Nazi mine in November 1939 and spent the
next three years undergoing repairs. However when she was relaunched in
November 1942 the cruiser had been built up to be the Navy's strongest 
warship.

The following years she cemented her reputation as one the most feared ships in the conflict.

She
obliterated the German warship Scharnhorst in the  Battle of North Cape
in 1943 and played a key role in the Normandy landings blasting the 
defences of the German army's famed 'Atlantic Wall'.

After
the war in Europe ended, Belfast was sent to join the British Pacific 
Fleet in the Far East where Japan still posed a threat. She saw action 
again between 1950 and 1952 in the Korean War.

She
was entered into reserve in 1963 and following a campaign to avoid her 
being scrapped by the Government a trust was created and private funds 
ensured she was preserved as museum in 1971.

The
ship was moored on the Thames and opened to the public in 1978. The 
vessel is the last remaining major warship from the two world wars.

Sir
James Eberle, a former gunnery officer on HMS Belfast who rose to 
become Supreme Commander of Nato, said she's a 'proud and noble vessel'.
