As many as 11 ambulances at a time have been queuing up outside a North Wales hospital as Britain's A&E wards sink deeper into crisis.

Wrexham Maelor Hospital had to cancel routine operations on other wards to deal with the huge pressure on the casualty department.

Photos taken this week show long lines of ambulances queued outside the hospital, while other centres  have called in the Red Cross and others are asking fire engines to ferry patients around.

An estimated 11 ambulances were seen stacked up outside Wrexham hospital on Tuesday as the crisis hitting Britain's A&E departments continues to deepen

Yesterday, seven ambulances were seen at the hospital, which has resisted the move made by 13 other centres to declare a 'major incident' in a bid to ease the pressure

Despite the scenes outside A&E, Wrexham Maelor Hospital has not joined the 13 other hospitals which have declared 'major incidents' in a bid to ease congestion.

Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said they were experiencing a period of 'very high demand' which was continuing to increase.

Geoff Ryall-Harvey, of the local Community Health Council, said the backlog was due to changing habits among patients.

He told the local Daily Post newspaper: 'There's a trend where younger people tend not to use the GPs at all. It's not good for the NHS at the moment.

'It needs to look again at how it deals with emergencies. We have got places who will have no GP at the end of this month. That will mean people will go to A&E.'

A spokesman for the board in charge of the hospital said: 'Our staff are working incredibly hard to make sure that patients are getting the care they need and we can only ask for people's patience and understanding while we try to manage this difficult situation.' 

Meanwhile, Northern General Hospital in Sheffield has asked the Red Cross, a charity better known for helping victims of disasters in Third World countries, to operate two ambulances amid 'unprecedented pressure'. 

Red Cross staff were brought in to the Sheffield hospital on Tuesday to take injured people home following treatment.

A spokesman for the hospital said: 'We can only ask for people's patience and understanding while we try to manage this difficult situation'

Linda Kaye, British Red Cross service manager, said: 'Our volunteers were on hand to transport patients home from hospital in Sheffield, ensuring they got home safely and helping to reduce pressure on vital healthcare services.'

Bosses at the hospital said they are experiencing a 'huge rise' in demand for emergency care, with more than 4,000 people visiting A&E in December.

In an email to staff, trust chief executive Sir Andrew Cash said: 'The pressure on the emergency care system is unprecedented with A&E frequently reaching 100 people in the department and up to 50 people waiting for admission.

'December saw a 10.5 per cent increase in the number of emergency admissions compared to the previous December - an increase of almost 400 patients. The patients are also older than the usual admissions we have and many have longer lengths of stay due to their dependency and frailty.'

Sir Andrew made a personal apology to patients on Friday night after some were forced to wait hours with paramedics in a hospital corridor because no beds were available.

The Red Cross has contracts with a number of A&E units, including hospitals in London, Glasgow, Blackpool and Bristol - but was brought in at Sheffield amid the high pressure.

A spokesman for the charity said  'Our support means we can prevent unnecessary A&E admissions by ensuring non-emergency attendees are safely transported home and given follow up support. This also prevents readmission as we ensure that the patients have everything they need at home.'

Yesterday, the Fire Brigades Union – which represents 44,000 firefighters – warned that staff were increasingly being relied upon to cover for ambulances. 

NHS trusts around the country have been forced to declare 'major incidents' as they struggle to cope

University Hospital Wales in Cardiff is one of many hospitals where ambulances have been forced to queue

General secretary Matt Wrack said: 'The public are being put at risk because the Government have cut staff, resources and equipment in both the NHS and fire and rescue service. In certain incidences, firefighters have been diverted away from their own work.'

Seven hospitals remained on a status of 'major incident' last night, having declared they were struggling to cope with sheer numbers of patients arriving in A&E.

Over a 36-hour period on Monday and Tuesday, an unprecedented 13 hospitals across England announced they were experiencing 'major incidents', meaning they were drafting in extra staff and cancelling non-urgent operations. 

Such measures are usually reserved only for events when there are mass casualties – such as terror attacks or rail crashes.

And last night it emerged that another hospital was diverting mothers-to-be to a maternity unit 16 miles away because its labour ward was full of A&E patients.

Weston General in Weston-super-Mare said: 'We would like to offer our sincere apologies to any women affected by this and who were referred to St Michael's in Bristol instead.'

In Birmingham, the Heartlands Hospital has asked administrative staff including receptionists and office workers to help out on wards, even though they have no medical training. Figures on Tuesday showed A&E waiting times are at their worst in a decade.

The crisis has come about as many ambulance crews are queuing outside A&E – unable to drop off patients because it is so busy inside. So when another 999 call comes in, they are unable to respond. 

On Tuesday, an elderly woman who had fallen in the street was taken to the A&E unit at York Hospital, North Yorkshire, by firefighters passing through because the ambulance service was too busy. 

A paramedic later said there were queues of up to ten ambulances outside the hospital entrance.

But it is not an isolated case – County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Services both responded to three emergencies instead of ambulances in December and January. 

Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham has said of the issue: 'The crisis in ambulance services means that more and more 999 calls are being attended by fire engines and police cars.'

A Department of Health spokesman said: 'Occasionally – as has been the case for many years – fire crews stabilise patients when first on the scene of a particular incident but fire engines are not being diverted as makeshift ambulances.'

The crisis is set to become a big political issue ahead of May's General Election, with Labour leader Ed Miliband accusing David Cameron of 'betraying the trust' of voters on the NHS.

Mr Cameron last night criticised Mr Miliband for privately boasting of plans to 'weaponise' the health service and using the issue as a 'political football'.

Jenny Knowles, who had to wait for more than seven hours to be seen by a doctor after failling and breaking her nose 

Woman, 88, with broken nose made to wait 7 hours

An 88-year-old woman who fell and broke her nose had to wait more than seven hours to be seen by hospital doctors.

The saga began shortly after midnight on Monday when Jenny Knowles fell at her nursing home in County Durham.

Staff contacted her daughter, Gloria Wills, 66, who is an ex-chairman of the now disbanded Sedgefield Primary Care Trust.

Workers at the home in West Cornforth rang 999 for an ambulance at 12.05am but Miss Wills said it was not until 3.30am before one operated by the St John Ambulance arrived and took her mother to University Hospital of North Durham.

At the overstretched A&E unit, it was only at 7.15am that an X-ray confirmed that dementia sufferer Mrs Knowles had a broken nose.

North East Ambulance Service said: 'We would like to apologise to the patient.'

Great-gran's family gives up after 16 hours

A frail great-grandmother spent 16 hours waiting to be treated at an overstretched A&E department after a suspected mini-stroke before her disgusted family gave up.

Aimee-Louise Richards said her 81-year-old grandmother, who she did not want to name, was taken by ambulance to Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth last Thursday. It was for the same hospital that Florence Cunningham, also 81, had had to wait 11 hours for an ambulance.

Miss Richards said her grandmother spent two hours in an ambulance outside A&E before being transferred to a second ambulance at 1am. 'It wasn't until 4am that she was even brought into the unit and put on a trolley,' she said.

The pensioner was taken home at 4.30pm after the family lost patience. Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust failed to respond to a request for a comment.

Injured great-grandmother left lying in cold for nearly two hours 

'Real nightmare': Myfanwy Pleming was left with a chest infection after she was left lying in the cold while she waited for an ambulance following a fall

A great-grandmother says she was left outside waiting for an ambulance for almost two hours after falling on a pavement.

Myfanwy Pleming fell outside her home in Saron, North Wales and broke her leg, but had to wait for one hour and 40 minutes before she was finally taken to nearby Bangor hospital.

Neighbours desperately tried to keep the 67-year-old warm by wrapping her in fleeces but her condition rapidly deteriorated in the freezing temperatures.

Mrs Pleming, who says she contracted hypothermia because of the length of time she waited, said: 'I was in absolute agony. I've never been so cold in all my life.

'My next-door neighbour came out to help me and phoned for an ambulance at around 4.15pm

'My family and neighbours were doing everything they could to keep me warm. But we were still waiting on the pavement until the ambulance eventually arrived at 6pm.

'I'd broken my thigh but they couldn't give me treatment at the hospital because I'd developed a chest infection from being in the cold for so long.

'So I'm having to wait until March and I'm left walking on a frame in constant agony - it's been a real nightmare.'
