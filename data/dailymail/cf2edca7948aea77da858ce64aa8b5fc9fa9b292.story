President Obama will apparently forego his annual trip to Martha’s Vineyard this year, making it the first time he hasn’t gone since he began his presidency nearly four years ago.

Sources told the Boston Globe that the president and his family will not be coming to the picturesque island off of Cape Cod, as the complex travel plans sent in by White House staffers have been cancelled. 

It is likely Mr Obama is earnest to be seen as approachable and down-to-earth as he attempts to paint Mitt Romney as wealthy and out-of-touch with the lower and middle classes.

And with only four months until what will most certainly be a bitter campaign for the White House, he may find his time is better served off the golf course and in the Oval Office.

When he took time off to go to the well-heeled summer colony last year, he was hounded by some Republicans, who said he should have forgone his vacation to spend time fixing the dire economic situation.

Sgt. Thomas Medeiros told the Globe: ‘The word I have is that they are not coming this year,’ adding that he heard the news from the Secret Service.

Peter Martell, who owns the Wesley Hotel on the picturesque island, told the Cape Cod Times much of the same.

‘We had some (presidential reservations) early on, but they got cancelled,’ he said, noting that his hotel would often be backed by the president’s staffers. 

Even if the president had followed through with his scheduled vacation, the lodging at which he and his family stayed would no longer be available.

The Blue Heron Farm in West Tisbury was purchased by celebrated British architect Baron Foster.

See you soon? Mr Obama waves to the crowd in front of the takeout window of Nancy's restaurant last August; without the president and his staffers, the island will undoubtedly be much quieter

He and Lady Foster bought the estate last November for $21.9million from Sotheby’s, according to the Globe. Prior to that, the sprawling 30-acre estate could be rented for $50,000 a week.

The White House declined to comment on the matter.

Conversely, presumptive Republican candidate Mitt Romney started the week vacationing with the entire Romney clan at Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire.

The annual sporting event, held at the sprawling $8million estate, involves a triathlon of biking, swimming and running, as well as more unusual activities such as a nail hammering game.

Mr Romney bought the estate, now valued at approximately $10million, back in 1997 for $2.5million.

The property, spread over 13-acres, boasts a six-bedroom house, a horse stable with guest apartments above it, a $630,000 boat house, tennis and volleyball courts and a 768 feet long shoreline.

Presidents and presidential hopefuls have never had an easy time over taking time off.Former president George W. Bush was on the receiving end of harsh criticism for taking extended trips to his ranch in Texas. 

According to CBS News, he spent 490 days total at the 1,600 acre Crawford property during his two terms as president.

His presidency was marred by his belated response to Hurricane Katrina, in which he remained on vacation in Texas for more than a day after the storm struck.
