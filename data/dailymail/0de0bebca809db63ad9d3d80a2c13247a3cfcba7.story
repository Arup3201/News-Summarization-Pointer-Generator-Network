Defence chiefs controversially delayed introducing a warning system which could have prevented a mid-air collision between RAF jets that killed three airmen.

Squadron Leader Samuel Bailey and Flight Lieutenants Hywel Poole and Adam Sanders died when two £40million Tornado GR4 warplanes crashed during a training mission over north-east Scotland.

The fighter-bombers, each carrying a pilot and a navigator, spun out of control and plunged into the Moray Firth on July 2012.

But the Ministry of Defence yesterday confirmed it had identified a collision warning system for the fast jets four years before the fatal accident.

And the state-of-the-art £53.5million device was not finally approved for the Tornados until October 2012 - three months after the tragedy.

Military sources said cost-saving in the cash-strapped MoD meant the RAF was forced to shelve the scheme in favour of other kit.

An RAF board of inquiry has completed a report on last summer's collision and handed a copy to the procurator fiscal who will decide whether a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) will be held. The board's findings have not been published.

The conclusions of the report are understood to be 'problematic' for defence chiefs, a source told the Mail.

Last night Angus Robertson, the Moray SNP MP, said the absence of collision avoidance equipment on the Tornados should be 'an important consideration' for any inquiry into the doomed aircraft.

He said: 'No doubt the absence of a collision avoidance system in Tornado fast jets will be an important consideration and these parliamentary answers from the Ministry of Defence shed light on the issue.

'As in all tragic cases which involved the death and injury of service personnel our thoughts must be with those directly and indirectly affected.

'It is imperative that all lessons are learnt from the Tornado collision over the Moray Firth.'

Mr Robertson uncovered the delay in the procurement of collision warning equipment for the fighter jets after asking a series of Parliamentary Questions.

Defence Equipment Minister Philip Dunne confirmed a 'commercial off-the-shelf' traffic collision avoidance system' was recommended by the MoD in 2008.

He said the £53.5million was approved for installation in October 2012 and a contract for the work required was awarded in December that year.

The first two jets to be fitted with the system were delivered to the RAF in August this year. The roll out of the equipment is to be completed by December 2014.

Mr Dunne said: 'A Tornado traffic collision avoidance system has been developed which is expected to achieve initial operating capability by the end of next year.'

Insiders in Whitehall said the delay in approving the collision warning system had occurred because of a shortage of cash at the MoD.

The Tory-led Coalition elected in May 2010 was forced to order the sprawling department to make savings of £4.7billion over five years and plug a £38billion black hole in funding for the equipment programme.

'There was only a limited amount of money,' said one source. 'If you haven't got it, you can't spend.'

Defence chiefs might also have thought twice about spending millions of pounds upgrading warplanes that will be taken out of service in 2018.

Sq Ldr Bailey, 36, from Nottingham, Flt Lt Poole, 28, from Bangor, North Wales, and Flt Lt Sanders, 27, from Lancashire, died in the accident close to the Beatrice oilfield in the Moray Firth. Sq Ldr Paul Evans survived but was badly injured.

The crew were all from 15 (Reserve) Squadron based at RAF Lossiemouth. They were understood to be taking part in practice bombing runs in fog.

The Tornado GR4 is a two-seat attack aircraft which is capable of delivering a variety of bombs and missiles, including Brimstone, Paveway and Storm Shadow, has a maximum altitude of 50,000ft and a top speed of Mach 1.3.

The Tornado has been in service with the RAF since 1979 and the frontline squadrons are veterans of a string of conflicts with hundreds of hours flying experience.

An MoD spokesman said: 'There are already a range of mitigation measures in place to minimise the risk of mid-air collision and tragic incidents such as that in Moray are extremely rare.

'A specifically designed Tornado Collision Warning System, which will be another tool for pilots to use, is currently being trialled and will be in service in next year.'
