Announcement: Director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer (above) said the CPS is considering the cases of 11 suspects in the phone-hacking probe

Eleven suspects have been referred to prosecutors by Scotland Yard's phone-hacking squad, it was revealed today.

Four files relating to four journalists, one police officer and six other individuals are being considered, director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer QC said.

Offences under consideration include misconduct in a public office, data protection act breaches, perverting the course of justice, witness intimidation and breaches of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa).

Mr Starmer refused to give a timescale for a charging decision, but said: 'We are now entering a period where we are likely to make a decision one way or another.'

Some of the suspects referred to in the files have not been questioned by police yet, the DPP said.

A total of 43 people arrested under the various operations sparked by disclosures of phone-hacking at the News of the World remained on bail, Mr Starmer added.

The announcement came as Britain's top prosecutor published guidelines setting out how journalists may have broken the law.

Mr Starmer said the new rules would help lawyers with the 'very difficult decisions'.

'The decisions we are going to make are going to be extremely difficult and extremely sensitive,' he said.

'We have got to make a decision because these cases are coming. We cannot duck that.'

The four files include:

Mr Starmer said: 'These just happen to be the four files we have got, there may be others. We don't know.'

He said the files relate to four investigations being carried out at the Metropolitan Police: Weeting, Elveden, Kilo and Sasha.

The new guidelines will help prosecutors come to a charging decision when weighing up the allegations against the public interest.

Scotland Yard's wide-ranging investigation into phone-hacking and corruption has led to the arrest of 46 people so far - with three told they face no further action.

Since a fresh inquiry was launched in January last year, there have been 22 Weeting-led arrests, 23 Elveden-led arrests and three Tuleta-led arrests.

Former News of the World chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and Rebekah Brooks, the former News International chief executive, have been held several times for different offences.

Former editor of the News of the World and Prime Minister David Cameron's ex-communications director, Andy Coulson, has also been held.

Under Operation Kilo - the inquiry into police leaks from Operation Weeting - Guardian reporter Amelia Hill was questioned last year under caution.

Ms Hill, the paper's special investigations correspondent, is understood to have been the only journalist questioned under Operation Kilo last autumn.

A 51-year-old detective who worked under Operation Weeting was arrested in relation to the allegation on August 19 last year.

Mr Thurlbeck, who also been held on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications, is believed to be the only suspect held on suspicion of witness intimidation.

He is accused of publishing personal details about a News International executive on his online blog.

A CPS spokeswoman said later: 'We are not prepared to discuss the identities of those involved or the alleged offences in any greater detail at this stage as a number of related investigations are ongoing.

'We are unable to give any timescale for charging decisions, except to say that these cases are being considered very carefully and thoroughly, and the decisions will be made as soon as is practicable.'

The new guidelines state that the offence of misconduct in a public office carries a maximum jail term of life.

Unlawful interceptions of communications carry sentences of two years behind bars.

Mr
Starmer said: 'Freedom of expression and the public right to know about
important matters of public debate are an essential foundation of our 
society - but there are limits for those who cross the line into 
criminality.

'These guidelines will assist prosecutors in striking the right balance between those interests in cases affecting the media.

'Journalists,
and those who work with them, are not afforded special status under the
criminal law, but the public interest served by their actions is a 
relevant factor in deciding whether they should be prosecuted in an 
individual case.'

Mr Starmer added that the rules would have helped lawyers come to swifter conclusions in the past.

He raised allegations against journalists regarding the parliamentary expenses scandal as an example where lawyers were right not to make charges.

Mr Starmer said: 'These guidelines will ensure consistency but will also provide openness and transparency to the public on what victims can expect, and to the media on the approach that prosecutors will take when considering such cases.

'This is an issue of great public concern and I want to give everyone who is interested a chance to give their views on what prosecutors will consider.'

The report requires prosecutors to consider the European Convention of Human Rights' assertion on the use of confidential sources.

'That does not mean that prosecutions should never be brought where journalists may have to disclose their sources, but it does require prosecutors to give weight to the public interest in protecting journalist' sources when assessing whether the public interest served by the conduct in question outweighs the overall criminality,' the guidelines say.

The investigations grew out of revelations that journalists at the News of the World routinely intercepted voice mails of those in the public eye.

News Corp chief Rupert Murdoch closed down the 168-year-old tabloid in July and the scandal triggered a judge-led public inquiry into media ethics.

Metropolitan Police figures showed that there were 829 potential victims of phone hacking, of whom 231 were said to be uncontactable.

The scandal has also forced the resignation of Met Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson and his assistant John Yates.
