The son of an artist at the centre of a row over a school mural featuring a golliwog last night insisted his father was ‘no racist.’

But Henry Westwater said he could understand why the image, which sparked an on-going police investigation, was controversial – and would have no objection if it was replaced.

It was reported yesterday that a complaint about the 1930s painting - by RH Westwater - had been logged by Police Scotland as a ‘hate incident’.

The mural, which was painted in 1936 by RH Westwater and features scenes from Alice in Wonderland across nine panels, features a golliwog

Visiting parent Margaret Rocha, 43, who is herself black, made an official complaint after touring Wardie Primary School in north Edinburgh with her son who was at that time a prospective pupil.

The image is contained in a mural, based on Alice in Wonderland, which was lovingly restored two years ago and now takes pride of place in the school’s assembly hall. 

Last night Henry Westwater, 74, of Tain, Inverness-shire, said golliwogs had once been common, though he could understand why the image had proved offensive. 

But he suggested treating the situation as a ‘hate incident’ may be a flawed approach and said that while he would not want part of the mural to be ‘hacked out’, he could understand why some would want the golliwog image to be removed.

Mr Westwater said: ‘It was painted in 1936, when people’s perception of things was somewhat different.

‘I remember that I had a golliwog when I was a small boy; many children did. They used to be popular.  For this woman, her response to that image was obviously compelling and overwhelming.

‘I saw photographs of the mural when it was restored, and I dug out my copy of Alice in Wonderland.

‘My neighbour, for some reason, had collected 12 copies of Alice in Wonderland in different editions, and of course there was no golliwog in any of them.

Council bosses have resisted pressure to remove or cover up the artwork at the school in the north of the city - but have introduced extra anti-racism lessons

‘It may be he felt the fantasy element of the story gave him some licence to create a new character.‘But my father didn’t have any views at all on other races, and he was certainly no racist.’

He added: ‘I can see why it could be a bit offensive – I didn’t give our children or grandchildren golliwogs.  

‘This woman has every right to complain.  But this painting is from another time.  

‘I would not wish to criticise the police, as I understand the legislation is framed in such a way that they are obliged to investigate complaints and I wouldn’t want to presume to lecture the council’s education department.

‘But for a “hate incident”, there has to be a “hater” - and that seems to be something missing from this case - while the artist [who died in 1962] is long-dead.’

Scottish artist Robert Heriot Westwater, who painted a mural depicting Alice In Wonderland at Wardie Primary School in Edinburgh in the 1930s

He added: ‘I wouldn’t like the mural to have a bit of it hacked out, but if someone feels strongly enough that it should be painted out, and replaced with something else, that would be okay.’ 

Fife-born Robert Heriot Westwater, who was born in 1905, was responsible for well-known portraits of poet Hugh MacDiarmid and Sir Compton Mackenzie, who wrote the comic novel Whisky Galore, later turned into a hit Ealing comedy movie.

Last night Police Scotland said Mrs Rocha’s complaint was still being considered.

Mrs Rocha was astonished to find the mural, which features scenes from Alice in Wonderland across nine panels.  

It was restored in 2011 with a £17,600 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF). 

Mrs Rocha, who said she would now find a different school for her son, said she found the image ‘deeply offensive’ and struggled to believe the recent restoration had been be allowed.

She said: ‘I raised it with the headteacher and she shrugged her shoulders and didn’t seem to think it was an issue.

‘It’s an inappropriate image for a primary school hall. It’s one thing if it was a museum piece or an exhibition, where you might explain what a swastika was or Ku Klux Klan outfit. 

‘It goes back to the American Black Sambo - the blacked-up face.’ 

In the mural, the golliwog is sitting on an alcove ledge above the Alice in Wonderland figure in the mural’s central panel.

The mural and Wardie school’s distinctive architecture are well-known in academic circles.

Colin McLean, head of HLF Scotland, has contacted the school over the future of the artwork, with further discussions likely to take place later this week. 

Last night the City of Edinburgh Council reiterated its position – that it will not consider covering up the image.

But officials have said they will now use additional teaching packs from Show Racism the Red Card campaign at the school.

A council spokesman insisted the council and school took diversity and anti-racism extremely seriously.
