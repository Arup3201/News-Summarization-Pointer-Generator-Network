A Victorian chicken farmer who battled local council bureaucracy for five years says he hopes the multimillion dollar film being made about his life will inspire others 'to take no nonsense'.

Allan Marsh, better known as Swampy in his local community, helped the decimated Little Penguins of Middle Island, off the coast of Warrnambool in south-west Victoria, survive after his faithful maremma dog Oddball began protecting them in 2006.

His unusual idea - to use the Italian sheepdogs to protect the local penguins from red foxes - has now been acclaimed by conservationists and the 'wildlife worriers' he once fought so hard against.

'The weird thing about the movie is that it might inspire someone out there to say "I've got a good idea and I’m not going to back down",' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Allan Marsh, known as Swampy in his local community, helped the decimated Little Penguins of Middle Island, survive after his faithful maremma dog Oddball began protecting them in 2006

Swampy first realised the protective nature of the white maremma dogs when David Williams, a university science student working on his farm, recommended he get one to protect his chooks from the red foxes.

He had the idea of using the dogs to protect the threatened Little Penguins after a newspaper article exposed how they were being killed in their hundreds. In 2004, 234 were killed by red foxes. In 2004-2005 only four penguins were left on the island, Deakin University reported.

Swampy said to Dave: 'I reckon these dogs would do the job.'

Coincidentally Dave’s father Stanley was a wildlife officer with the Victorian Department of Environment and Sustainability and supported Swampy’s idea… but then came the first hurdle.

Warrnambool City Council told them dogs were not allowed on Middle Island.

The successful idea then inspired Swampy to suggest using the dogs to protect the threatened Little Penguins after it was reported they were being killed in their hundreds and their numbers were dwindling

Swampy explained how they had to wait until someone new started working at the council before they could take their battle against the people he calls ‘wildlife worriers’ any further. That person turned out to be Ian Fitzgibbon and his boss Neil Allen.

‘We nicknamed Neil Allen the toe cutter as he had everyone jumping when he said something,’ Swampy laughed.

In the forthcoming film, starring actor Shane Jacobson as the chook farmer, Swampy said a male dog called Meeeko will play Oddball. The dog is the real life Oddball’s grandson.

Oddball is a retired 14-year-old bitch who Swampy bred on his farm.

‘She was the first one to go out on the island to protect the penguins,’ he explained.

‘She was the one to go because all the authorities were terrified the dogs were going to bite someone and they just wanted a nice easy going one out there,’ he said.

Middle Island in Warrnambool, Victoria, is cut off from land when the swell is up but during some months of the year red foxes can access it

Oddball originally went to the island for three weeks but she got ‘lonely and swam home’. Then her aunt Missy was sent out there but she also swam home.

‘They aren’t used to being by themselves, they are used to being with a pack,’ Swampy explained.

He finally managed to get the authorities to see that they needed two dogs out there for it to work so they didn’t get lonely.

‘When it finally started to happen it was after five-years that we'd been working on it… but the principal is ridiculously simple,’ Swampy said.

‘The wildlife worriers don’t understand dogs. They don’t have real ones themselves, they might have little yappy things.

‘They don’t understand how their territory works. That’s why dogs attack the postman. Maremmas have an exceptionally strong sense of territory,’ he reasoned.

At first, Warrnambool City Council said dogs were not allowed on Middle Island. However the idea was eventually approved by Ian Fitzgibbon when he joined the council team

The Middle Island Little Penguins breed on the land and live in burrows dug out in the sand, soil or man-made structures. The maremmas are light-footed and do not disturb their nests

Swampy said the maremmas aren’t particularly fussed about the penguins, instead they are guarding the territory on the island.

‘They are cohabiting, they don’t bond with them they put up with them,’ he laughed. 

‘When a fox tries to invade their territory then they’ve got an argument on their hands. That argument initially starts of as a lot of barking and they bite. They have a good set of teeth.'

Despite now being retired, Swampy said ‘Oddy killed a fox 12 months ago … she’s still capable of taking on a fox.’

Swampy had no idea a film would be made about his life but explained Jacobson’s flick is just the latest media attention he’s received over the years.

When Oddball first started saving the penguins it was around the time of the release of the 2006 Australian-American film Happy Feet.

Warrnambool City Council and Deakin University run the Middle Island Maremma Project which has helped the penguin population survive after being threatened by foxes

Once every two weeks during the breeding season, a group of volunteers look for the penguins on Middle Island to count them

‘The media all round the world just went berserk. We had the BBC and National Geographic and Japan and every TV channel in the country,’ he explained.

Jacobson’s film, which recently wrapped filming, is not a documentary. 'They’ve used their artistic license,' Swampy said.

In one scene a fox will be shown coming into the bathroom where a rescued penguin is living.

Swampy laughed: ‘In real life you are not allowed to pick up penguins and take them home.’

The movie is set until the dogs started working on Middle Island but Swampy said the ‘funny stuff has happened since then’ and thus he’s eager for a sequel to be made.

One of his many anecdotes from his adventures with Oddball revolves around the time a penguin pecked her on the nose. ‘She still has a pink spot,’ he laughed.

‘I’m sitting there with this aboriginal elder guy called John and we could not concentrate it was so funny,’ he said.

Dog handler Phil Root with Middle Island's current guards Eudy and Tula: Swampy explained that the dogs guard the territory, 'they are cohabiting [with the penguins]. They don't bond with them, they put up with them'

Eudy and Tula live on the Island for a week at a time and are the 6th and 7th dogs to take part in the project to save the penguins

By the end of this year, Swampy could be leaving his huge Victorian chook farm behind to jet around America and Europe for the film’s red carpet promotional trail.

‘They said “make sure your passport is up to date” and I said “make sure your cheque book is up to date”,’ he laughed.

Meanwhile, Oddball is living the ‘life of leisure’. She spends her afternoons on the veranda under the sun. 

‘She has worked hard for 13 years that’s the equivalent of 90 years human work, she has done well,’ he said.

Swampy had to put her brother down 12 months ago because he had stomach cancer and said ‘the two had been inseparable’.

‘That’s part of the reason she swam off the island before because she’d never been alone,’ he said.

The farmer cannot talk highly enough of his maremmas, including Oddball who once comforted him after he fell off the back of his truck and badly winded himself.

‘The next thing I knew oddball was cuddled up to me looking after me,’ he recalled.

The passionate dog lover said ‘we need to give animals a great deal more respect for their abilities than we do.’

‘We think we are the Supreme Being, in fact we are the meanest predator,’ he said.

Phil Root looks after the maremmas now that Oddball has retired

Oddball may now be retired but Swampy still patrols the beach off the coast of Warrnambool two or three times a week with his dog Max, who leaves his scent to ward off the foxes.

As for the penguins, they are thriving and are back up to a population of around 100.

Middle Island is currently cut off from unwanted visitors because of a high-swell but two maremmas – Eudy and Tula - live on the Island for a week at a time.

They are the 6th and 7th dogs, looked after by dog handler Phil Root, to be used for the project and the island has remained fox free since the maremmas were introduced in 2006.

And just as Oddball's legend lives on in the local community, so does Swampy’s.

‘I guess he’s one of the creative existential thinkers that we all have in our cities.

‘He’s obviously someone one that thinks outside the square,’ Ian Fitzgibbon, Warrnambool council’s driver of the Middle Island Maremma Project said.

‘We just pulled together all the parts of the puzzle which turned Swampy’s ideas into reality.'
