A 40ft sinkhole has drained almost all of the water from a pond in a park.

The man-made pond at Abney Hall Park in Stockport, Greater Manchester, took just hours to drain away after water was spotted spiralling down a 'giant plughole' on Thursday morning.

The hole in the bed of the clay pond is believed to lie above a massive 40ft sinkhole which is taking water away to a nearby waterfall.

Work to preserve wildlife living in the pond is currently underway, while walkers and park enthusiasts have reacted with horror at the state of the former beauty spot.

Jean Goulden, chair of the Friends of Abney Hall Park, said: 'You could see the water swirling around just like there was a giant plughole.

'It's terrible for the community as it's a much-loved area for families and dog walkers, it's our little bit of countryside in the middle of the village and we feel very lucky to have it, so we're hoping something can be done as soon as possible.'

Sucked away: The pond was built in the 1970s and is currently home to a range of fish as well as mallards, swans and moorhens

Kate Peacock, who runs the nearby Abney Gardens Community Cafe - and even gave her two children the middle name 'Abney' after the park - said: 'It's the heart of the park and we're determined to do whatever it takes to save it.

'We noticed the water had gone down slightly on Monday, then a bit more on Tuesday and by Wednesday we thought 'something's going on here' and started reporting it to all the relevant agencies.

'It's unbelievable that you've got a giant sinkhole in the middle of Cheadle.'

The pond was built in the 1970s and is currently home to a range of fish as well as mallards, swans and moorhens.

Online: Worried residents took to Twitter after the water began to drain away. The Environment Agency has said there is no immediate risk to wildlifeÂ 

Some of the fish are thought to have been drained away and others are left in a small pocket of remaining water in the middle of the pond.

The Environment Agency has said there is no immediate risk to wildlife and no pollution to other waterways.

A Stockport Council spokesman said the pond is no longer losing water and work to assess the situation is ongoing.

He said: 'The water that continues to flow out of the pond is running at a rate similar to that which is flowing in. The advice from the Environment Agency is that the fish are fine where they are.

'The outflow from the pond has been traced and there has been no flooding of surrounding land or property.'
