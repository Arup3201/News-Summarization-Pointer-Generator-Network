As 41 soldiers who have lost their lives during Australian operations in Afghanistan are honoured, a new batch of troops has begun training for a new mission in the war-torn country.

Australian soldiers in Afghanistan will begin the new year by undertaking a mentoring, training and medical mission only, as 13 years of military engagement winds up.

On January 1, the US-led International Security Assistance Force combat mission, which has suffered 3485 military deaths since 2001, will be replaced by a NATO 'training and support' operation.

The remaining contingent of soldiers face considerable danger, Major General Mulhall added.

'Under Operation Slipper, (Australia's contingent) has made a substantial contribution to the international mission in Afghanistan at various levels from combat operations to training and advisory roles,' said Major General Mulhall.

'Our men and women continue to be exposed to danger and as such the Australian Defence Force is committed to ensuring all activities that our personnel undertake are thoroughly risk managed.'

Their ranks have sustained soaring casualties with 4600 killed in 10 months in 2014.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has expressed concern about ongoing security problems in Afghanistan and insists Australia will be monitoring the situation closely.

About 400 Australian personnel are deployed on what is known as Operation High Road, which includes embedded positions with the NATO led mission, advisory roles, medical, force protection and logistic support.
