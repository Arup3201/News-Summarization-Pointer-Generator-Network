Southampton's current crop of stars are remaining upbeat despite the fact they have lost so many of their teammates.

Jose Fonte has taken to Instagram to publicise Southampton's high spirits inside the Premier League's camp ahead of the new season.

Southampton have had a summer to forget with Rickie Lambert, Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Calum Chambers and Dejan Lovren all leaving St Mary's since the end of last season.

The south coast outfit also lost their manager Mauricio Pochettino to Tottenham  - which led to the club's mass exodus.

However despite all their problems - Fonte and Co. were splashing around during  a break from training.

Fonte posted the video accompanied with the message: 'Life is fun. Fun is happiness. Happiness is everything. Have a good day #COYS.'
