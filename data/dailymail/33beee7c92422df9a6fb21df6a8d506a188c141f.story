Apples are often said to be healthy snack and a good low-calorie food - but could they also be a promising aphrodisiac?

That’s the case according to a study that says the fruit can boost sexual pleasure in women.

The researchers found a link between enhanced sexual function in healthy women and regular daily apple use.

Researchers in Italy have found apples (stock image shown) can boost sexual pleasure. The findings were made as part of a study of 731 Italian women. Each of the women was asked to say how often they consumed apples, with those who ate more reporting higher sexual pleasure

An apple a day could stop you having a heart attack - and may even be as effective as taking a statin, claim Oxford University researchers.

They say healthy over-50s who add a daily apple to their diet can benefit as much as those who start taking a tablet.

Their study goes some way to proving the proverb coined by the Victorians: ‘An apple a day keeps the doctor away.’

The scientists’ calculations suggest that prescribing an apple a day to everyone aged 50 and over would prevent or delay around 8,500 heart attacks and strokes a year in the UK.

The health benefits are similar to giving statins to everyone over 50 who is not already taking cholesterol-lowering drugs.

In the study published in Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics they analysed 731 healthy Italian women aged 18 to 43.

All of the participants were asked to report on their daily apple consumption and their eating habits.

They were then split into two groups, one that ate apples regularly - more than one a day - and another that ate less than one a day.

The participants were then also asked to fill out the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI).

The FSFI required them to answer 19 questions about their sexual activities including frequency and overall satisfaction, reports Huffington Post.

It was found that eating an apple a day was linked with higher FSFI scores, suggesting it increased their sexual pleasure.

Eating more apples apparently increased their lubrication and sexual function, enhancing the experience according to the study.

The researchers think the reason for this may be because apples contain phloridzin.

This is a compound that is quite similar to the female sex hormone called estradiol, which plays a large role in sexual arousal.

‘This study suggests a potential 
relationship between regular daily apple consumption and better 
sexuality in our young women population,’ the researchers conclude.

The reason for this according to the researchers may be that, like red wine and chocolate (stock image shown), apples contain a compound that boosts sexual arousal, in this case  phloridzi, which is quite similar to the female sex hormone called estradiol that plays a large role in sexual arousal
