FIFA President Sepp Blatter says he's concerned by a study highlighting the scale of Russia's racism problem ahead of the 2018 World Cup.

The Fare network organization and the Moscow-based SOVA Center detailed dozens of cases of discriminatory behaviour linked to Russian football over two seasons.

The report has been received by FIFA and Blatter told The Associated Press: 'I am aware of the report ... sure we are concerned, definitely.'

In 2013, CSKA Moscow were ordered to close part of their stadium for racist chanting against Yaya Toure 

Last year, Blatter spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin about making tackling racism a priority in 2018.

Blatter says 'if it does not stop then there must be some sanctions.'

Speaking on the sidelines of a meeting in Northern Ireland, Blatter added: 'Racism is one of the items which is on my agenda on the very top, every day.'
