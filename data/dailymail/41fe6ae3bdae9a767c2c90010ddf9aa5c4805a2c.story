Rising star: Liz Truss is the youngest-ever woman to join a Conservative Cabinet and is already being talked up as the 'next Margaret Thatcher'

For the youngest-ever woman to join a Conservative Cabinet — especially one who is already being talked up as the ‘next Margaret Thatcher’ — Liz Truss has some unusual qualifications.

The new Environment Secretary, 38, whose constituency is just 15 miles from the Queen’s Norfolk home at Sandringham, once called for the Monarchy’s abolition.

She’s also described the British as ‘among the worst idlers in the world’.

Then there was the little matter of an 18-month adulterous affair with a married Tory MP which, he said, cost him his marriage. It caused an almighty storm when she stood as a Tory parliamentary candidate in South West Norfolk and it emerged that she had failed to tell the selection committee about the relationship.

All this is history, though.

Who could deny the ambitious Truss’s astonishing agility, despite all that baggage, to find herself in the Cabinet less than four years since becoming an MP?

‘Working with her is like being next to a hornets’ nest,’ says one figure who has worked under her at Westminster. ‘It’s ceaseless, frenetic activity under the sword of Damocles if things aren’t done exactly as she wants them.’

Elizabeth Mary Truss has all the correct credentials to offset a party hierarchy full of Old Etonians. Her first school was a primary in Paisley, Scotland, before moving to a comprehensive in Leeds.

She was brought up in a Left-wing household — her father a mathematics professor, her mother a nurse who took her on CND marches.

At Oxford University, Truss was president of the Lib Dems and questioned the need for the Monarchy. She declared: ‘We Liberal Democrats believe in opportunity for all. We believe in fairness and common sense . . . we do not believe people are born to rule.’

Two years later, however, she joined the Conservative Party.

After being elected as an MP, she co-authored Britannia Unchained, which set out proposals to restore Britain’s economic position.

One passage said: ‘The British are 
among the worst idlers in the world. We work among the lowest hours, we 
retire early and our productivity is poor. Whereas Indian children 
aspire to be doctors or businessmen, the British are more interested in 
football and pop music.’

And
 now to the affair. At 28, she was burning for front-line politics, 
having worked for both Shell and Cable & Wireless in executive and 
accountancy roles. She had made it on to the party list of ‘preferred 
candidates’ when, in the run-up to the 2005 election, she worked in the 
office of Tory frontbencher Mark Field, the culture spokesman, who was 
41.

She was married, too, to a financial controller. Field’s wife Michelle was chief executive of a hospital charitable foundation.

The affair lasted 18 months, towards 
the end of which she became pregnant. Truss told friends that the baby 
was her husband’s and when it was born, he was named as the father on 
the birth certificate. Indeed, Truss’s marriage survived the 
scandal.Though the affair was well-known around Westminster, no one told
 the selection committee at South West Norfolk.

Their
 indignation at having chosen someone with such a large skeleton 
jangling in her cupboard led to vain efforts to deselect her, prompting 
some bright spark among the Westminster Tory chatterati to dub those 
recalcitrant locals as the ‘Turnip Taliban’.

But
 the relevant moniker should have been ‘Teflon Truss’. A war of words 
raged, and when it died down, there she was, unhindered in her march to 
political stardom.

Field was not so lucky. His wife 
divorced him and he lost his frontbench position. These days, as his 
former intern-lover takes her seat at the Cabinet table, he remains on 
the backbenches as he approaches his 50th birthday. He is, however, 
happily remarried.

Around 
Westminster, when  they bump into each other, they nod politely. Truss 
has now also effectively leapfrogged her former boss at the Department 
for Education, Michael Gove. While working as his junior there, some 
detected what one colleague describes as ‘the whiff of disloyalty’ in 
the frank way she would talk publicly about her ‘disappointment’ over 
Gove not acting on her suggestions.

As
 for the Environment brief, she is ‘ferociously intelligent and will 
pick it up very quickly,’ says one close figure, ‘even though I observe 
scant interest in agriculture and rural affairs beyond what she 
absolutely needed as an MP with an agricultural constituency’.

Those
 who work for her will also learn, as one with such experience says, 
‘that she is a sucker  for flattery. Compliments — especially about her 
genius, political skill, or emphatic, rosy predictions about her future 
career — are certain to be met with peals of girlish laughter. 

Survivor: Truss survived efforts to deselect her after news broke of her affair with Field. She is pictured arriving for the possible deselection vote at Swaffham Assembly Rooms in 2009
