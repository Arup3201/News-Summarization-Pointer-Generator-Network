The Iowa Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld its ruling that a dentist acted legally when he fired an attractive assistant because he found her irresistible and worried he would cheat on his wife.

Coming to the same conclusion as it did in December, the all-male panel found that bosses can fire employees they see as threats to their marriages, even if the subordinates have not engaged in flirtatious or other inappropriate behavior.

The court said such firings do not count as illegal sex discrimination because they are motivated by feelings, not gender.

The 32-page ruling upholds a judge's 
decision to dismiss a discrimination lawsuit filed against Fort Dodge 
dentist James Knight, who fired assistant Melissa Nelson, even while 
acknowledging she had been a stellar employee for 10 years.

Knight
and his wife believed that his attraction to Nelson — two decades 
younger than the dentist — had become a threat to their marriage. 
Nelson, now 33, was replaced by another woman; Knight had an all-female 
staff.

The all-male court 
issued its revised opinion Friday in the case after taking the unusual 
step last month of withdrawing its December opinion, which had received 
nationwide publicity, debate and criticism.

Nelson's
attorney, Paige Fiedler, had asked the court in January to reconsider, 
calling the decision a blow for gender and racial equity in the 
workplace.

She had warned 
the opinion could allow bosses to legally fire dark-skinned blacks and 
replace them with light-skinned blacks or small-breasted workers in 
favor of big-breasted workers.

'It
was a great decision,' Knight's attorney, Stu Cochrane, told Messenger News. 'I don't 
see this as necessarily different from their first decision, but I'm 
impressed with the court's effort to clearly communicate the rationale 
for the decision.'

Justice 
Edward Mansfield wrtoe in their opinion that had  Nelson brought a 
sexual harassment or hostile work environment claim, the outcome could 
have been different. Instead, the former employee had alleged that she 
was fired because of her gender.

The court had only granted reconsiderations five times in the last decade.

Dr Knight had said he fired Ms. Nelson because he'd grown too close to her and was worried he'd try to start an affair.

In December, the court ruled 7-0 bosses can sack 
employees they see as an 'irresistible attraction,' even if they have 
not engaged in flirtatious behavior or otherwise done anything wrong.

The decision drew national attention and sparked much controversy.

Ms. Nelson's attorney said Iowa's all-male high court, one of only a handful in the nation, failed to recognize the discrimination women see routinely in the workplace.

The dental nurse insisted she was never interested in Knight romantically, regardless of his own feelings.

'Absolutely not,' she said. 'I'm happily married.'

Since Knight fired her she has been working as a waitress six nights a week.

While her former boss claimed her clothes were so tight he couldn't look at her without being aroused, Ms. Nelson said the only outfit she wore to work was standard scrubs worn by many nurses and assistants in dental offices.

Asked if she saw herself as irresistibly attractive, she laughed.

'I'm just an ordinary girl,' she said. 'Just an ordinary mom.'

Ms. Nelson, 33, worked for Knight for 10 years, and he considered her a stellar worker. But in the final months of her employment, he complained that her tight clothing was distracting, once telling her that if his pants were bulging that was a sign her clothes were too revealing, according to the opinion.

He also once allegedly remarked about her infrequent sex life by saying, 'that's like having a Lamborghini in the garage and never driving it.'

Knight and Nelson — both married with children — started exchanging text messages, mostly about personal matters, such as their families.

Knight's wife, who also worked in the dental office, discovered the messages and demanded Nelson be fired. The Knights consulted their pastor, who agreed that terminating Nelson was appropriate.

Knight fired Nelson and gave her one month's severance. He later told Nelson's husband he worried he was getting too personally attached and feared he would eventually try to start an affair with her.

Nelson was stunned because she viewed 
the 53-year-old Knight as a father figure and had never been interested 
in starting a relationship, Fiedler said.

Nelson filed a lawsuit alleging gender discrimination, arguing Knight wouldn't have terminated her if she was male. She did not allege sexual harassment because Knight's conduct may not have risen to that level and didn't particularly offend her, Fiedler said.

However, it has been revealed Knight sent Nelson raunchy text messages about six months before her dismissal asking how often she 'experiences orgasms.'

Knight argued Ms. Nelson was fired not because of her gender, but because her continued employment threatened his marriage. A district judge agreed, dismissing the case before trial, and the high court upheld that ruling.

Mansfield noted that Knight had an all-female workforce and Ms. Nelson was replaced by a woman.

He said the decision was in line with state and federal court rulings that found workers can be fired for relationships that cause jealousy and tension within a business owner's family. One such case from the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a business owner's firing of a valued employee who was seen by his wife as a threat to their marriage. In that case, the fired employee had engaged in flirtatious conduct.

Mansfield said allowing Nelson's lawsuit would stretch the definition of discrimination to allow anyone fired over a relationship to file a claim arguing they would not have been fired but for their gender.

Knight's attorney said the court got it right. The decision clarified that bosses can make decisions showing favoritism to a family member without committing discrimination; in this case, by allowing Knight to honor his wife's wishes to fire Nelson, he said.

Knight is a very religious and moral individual, and he sincerely believed that firing Nelson would be best for all parties, he said.

'While there was really no fault on the part of Mrs. Nelson, it was just as clear the decision to terminate her was not related to the fact that she was a woman,' he said. 'The motives behind Dr. Knight terminating Mrs. Nelson were quite clear: He did so to preserve his marriage.

'I don't view this as a decision that was either pro-women or opposed to women rights at all. In my view, this was a decision that followed the appropriate case law.'
