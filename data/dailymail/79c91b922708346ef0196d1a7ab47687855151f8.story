The woman behind everyone's favorite cookie: Ruth Wakefield, founder of the Toll House restaurant in Whitman, Massachusetts, created the chocolate-chip cookie in 1938

There are two popular stories about how the chocolate-chip cookie was invented by Ruth Wakefield in 1938.

One theory is that Wakefield, the co-owner of Whitman, Massachusetts' Toll House restaurant, accidentally spilled a bag of chocolate morsels into a batch of cookie dough that was being prepared in a mixer.

The other is that Wakefield added chopped up bits of a chocolate candy bar when she ran out of nuts.

Both of those theories were disproved by Carolyn Wyman in her recently-published book about the sweet-treat's origin: 'The Great American Chocolate Chip Cookie book'.

In her research for the book, Wyman tracked down a rare interview given by Wakefield in 1974, just three years before the cookie inventor died.

In the interview, Wakefield explains that she was trying to improve a cookie recipe they had been serving at her restaurant.

'We had been serving a thin butterscotch nut cookie with ice cream. Everybody seemed to love it, but I was trying to give them something different,' Wakefield explained.

Adding chocolate chips made the cookies the new star of the dessert and they became an instant hit across the country.

Unlike the fame-seeking celebrity chefs of today, Wakefield didn't care to use her recipe to get her places.

Instead, she sold the recipe to Nestle nearly 75 years ago this week.

The chocolate company then went on to start mass-producing chocolate chips.

Touch of genius: Wakefield gave an interview in 1974, saying she was trying to improve a Butterscotch cookie when she created the world's first batch of chocolate-chip cookies

The best thing since sliced bread: The cookies became an instant hit at Wakefield's Toll House restaurant, and soon swept the country when Nestle began mass-producing chocolate chips

How-to: Soon after inventing the cookies, Wakefield sold the rights to her recipe to Nestle and they still publish her instructions on the back of their chocolate-chip bags

Chocolate chips remain one of the few food items specifically created for use in a recipe.

They also printed Wakefield's original Toll House cookies recipe on the back of the chocolate-chip packaging. The recipe is still on the back of the bag today and remains the most frequently made back-of-the-package recipe.

While it may seem a shame that Nestle profited from her invention, signing over her recipe proved fruitful in the end since it drove traffic to her restaurant and helped turn her cookbook 'Toll House Tried and True Recipes' into a best-seller. 

Eventually Wakefield and her husband Ken retired from running the restaurant, passing the popular eatery on to new owners.

Wakefield passed away in 1977, and was quickly followed in death by the Toll House restaurant itself. It burnt down on New Year's Day 1985.
