Nick Clegg today rejected claims he 'snubbed' the Autumn Statement after failing to turn up in the Commons for George Osborne's Autumn Statement today.

The Deputy Prime Minister spurned the chance to hear the Chancellor's statement in person and instead headed to Cornwall to announce funding for coastal defences.

Liberal Democrat aides insisted there had not been a behind-the-scenes fall out over the announcement – pointing out that the party had promoted many of the reforms.

The Deputy PM decided to go to Cornwall instead of staying in London for the Chancellor's statement - even though the  main announcement - overhauling stamp duty - has been Lib Dem policy since 2007

An aide explained he was in Penzance to talk to ordinary voters - and rejected claims he did not want to be photographed next to David Cameron.

He said: 'We are often told politicians should spend more time outside of Westminster talking to people and that is exactly what Nick is doing. This is not a snub.'

He added: 'I've spent four years dutifully sitting there on the green benches and this year I thought it would be a nice change to get out of the Westminster bubble and say what this Autumn Statement means to people, their families and businesses.'

The Deputy PM decided to stay away from the Commons even though the Autumn Statement's main announcement - overhauling stamp duty - has been Lib Dem policy since 2007.

From midnight tonight, stamp duty will no longer leap at each threshold but will rise gradually, with multi-million pound sales costing much more.

The stamp duty overhaul will be welcomed by those struggling to get on to the property ladder, or looking to buy a new home just above one of the old thresholds.

Mr Clegg arrived at Number 10 Downing Street this morning ahead of the Chancellor's Autumn Statement

But it risks angering those living in more expensive properties worth over £1million, particularly in London.

Despite the policy victory a source close to Mr Clegg said there was no point in Mr Clegg being in London.

He said: ‘He just sits there so he would rather get out in the country and talk to people about what the Autumn Statement means for them.’
