Monty says that there is a wide range of alpine plants that can be successfully grown in most gardens

Alpine plants are something I've come to late in the day.

I'd admired them for a long time and seen them growing in places as diverse as Tromso Botanical Garden in Norway, the Drakensberg mountains in South Africa and the Himalayas.

Now I'm building a small collection that is just getting into its prime flowering period in my own garden here, bejewelling the dozen pots and troughs I have - and which I add to almost weekly.

To describe a plant as an alpine refers to the conditions it naturally grows in rather than referring specifically to the Alps or even necessarily mountains.

Botanically they are plants that grow between the tree line and unmelted snow.

This tends to be on mountains but can be - and I have seen alpines growing magnificently there - at sea level, 300 miles inside the Arctic Circle.

Many alpines have adapted to growing in the biting cold and wind by being small and ground-hugging, only throwing up flowers in the brief summer months.

When plant material dies in these conditions it only decomposes very slowly and as a result the soil is usually very poor, so most alpines have evolved to be happiest in very stony or sandy soil with exceptionally good drainage.

But there are alpine meadows and woods and consequentially a wide range of alpines that can be successfully grown in most gardens.

Even if, like me, you have a garden whose soil is heavy clay, alpines can look their best in containers ranging from terracotta pots or pans to large stone troughs - which are ideal because they have a large surface area and because most alpines look good when set among a stony background.

Q My rhododendrons have only flowered once in the past year when previously they have flowered twice. Why? The garden gets quite a lot of wind and only partial shade.

Victor Snape, FlintshireA Given that rhodies hate wind, hot sun and dehydration you are lucky that they flower at all! All rhododendrons usually only flower once although occasionally they flower again in a mild autumn because they think spring has arrived early.Q How do I prune dwarf buddleias and should I repot them each year?

John Rogers, Carmarthenshire

A Dwarf buddleias only need repotting  once every three years as long as the soil is free draining and the container is large enough for the roots to grow. They produce flowers on new shoots, so prune hard now and you will have flowers in late summer just when the butterflies, which love buddleias best, need them most.Q What will happen if I cut off the top of my variegated hornbeam tree?

Mrs Hilary Montgomery, DorsetA Every tree has a leader, a particularly strong-growing shoot. Cut this and the shoots beneath it grow stronger and bush out until one replaces it and becomes the new leader. So your tree will bush out for a year or two and then go on growing up. I wonder if your 'variegated hornbeam' (there is no such thing) is in fact a variegated hawthorn maple - Acer crataegifolium 'Veitchii'?

The other advantage of containers is that they can easily have their soil customised to exactly suit the plants growing in them.

Because so many alpines are small, even tiny, growing them in pots suits them well and they can be moved so that they become a precious display when they are flowering and then set slightly to one side while they are hunkered down for winter. 

Of course, if you are very keen you can have a specialist alpine house, which is essentially an unheated greenhouse with a plunge bed, consisting of terracotta pots sunk into the soil to keep the roots cool, and extreme ventilation.

This is important because although the plants need maximum sun and shelter from rain, they certainly do not need heat or moist air.

To ensure good drainage for any alpine plant it is best to use at least 50 per cent horticultural grit mixed with peat-free potting compost.

Leaf mould or composted bark mixed with grit and some loam also make a perfectly good growing medium for any alpine. 

For sinks or troughs, fill the bottom foot or so with hard core (broken bricks and stones) and mix the soil with grit.

To test whether the drainage is sharp enough, make a heap of the soil mix, flattening the top and scooping out a hollow.

Fill this with water. If the water immediately soaks into the pile then the mix is correct. If it makes even the smallest puddle then it needs more grit.

Larger alpines can be grown in a rock garden - although these are increasingly unfashionable nowadays - or a dedicated raised bed filled with rubble and stone and topped with just an inch or two of topsoil mixed with the same volume of horticultural grit.

Alpines may be small but most are tough. The key things to remember for any alpine is plenty of sunshine, poor soil with really good drainage and ideally some protection from too much winter rain.
