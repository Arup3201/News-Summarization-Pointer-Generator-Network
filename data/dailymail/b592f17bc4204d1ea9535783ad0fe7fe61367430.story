A former Buffalo Bills cheerleader says squad members were auctioned off at a charity golf tournament, and made to sit on the winner's laps in just one of many demeaning tasks revealed in a new lawsuit against the football team.

A 23-year-old identifying herself as 'Alyssa U' is one of five former cheerleaders suing the team claiming she was underpaid and mistreated, and detailed the dark side of the job in an essay for the New York Post published Sunday.

A native of West Falls, New York, Alyssa was a life-long fan of the Bills and considered it a 'huge accomplishment' when she made the team for the 2012-2013 season.

Impossible standards: Alyssa, a life-long Bills fan, was initially excited when she made the team for the 2012-2013 season. But soon realized she was in over her head after reading the detailed contract. Above, Buffalo Jills cheer at a football game on August 9, 2012

But after looking over her contract, she knew she was in over her head.

The contract detailed everything about being a Buffalo Jill, from appropriate nail polish to how to properly sip soup at a formal dinner.

'I was taken back by it all. It’s degrading. It’s embarrassing to even talk about,' Alyssa told the Post.

Being a Buffalo Jill also required attending an annual charity golf tournament where squad members either performed tasks(like sitting at the dunk tank) or were auctioned off to ride along with the highest bidder in their golf car.

'Basically there were four seats to a golf cart — basically four men. So where was this Jill to sit? Well, in the golfer’s lap. It was very inappropriate,' Alyssa said.

The cheerleaders also had to endure grueling criticism about their bodies, routinely submitting to 'Jiggle Tests' in front of team management. If their body didn't look good while performing jumping jacks, they could be benched for a game.

Alyssa says that while the cheerleaders understood there were weight standards for being a professional cheerleader, judgements about weight often seemed random.

Footing the bill: Alyssa was allegedly told by team management that her blonde hair was not 'field ready' and that she would need to pay for it to get re-colored by a stylist who knew the 'Jills look' and also happened to be best friends with the coach.

'The inconsistency with the physique evaluations was pretty much a mind game. How someone’s weight could fluctuate from one week to the next — someone was field ready one week, not the next, and was the week after that, it was very emotional for these girls.'

Management specifically had a problem with Alyssa's blonde hair when she joined the team, and she was deemed not 'field ready'.

'I was told it was not natural looking, and that I needed to go see the Jill’s hairstylist who knew “the Jills look” — who also happened to be the coach’s best friend. 

'And it wasn’t free. You have to pay her, that’s not for free — but we got a $5 discount, so it was around $85,' she says. 

The
 Jills aren't paid for games or 
practices and have to make 20-35 appearances, most of which are unpaid, 
at community and charity events each season, the lawsuit said. Pay is 
$35 dollars an hour for a maximum of two hours, meaning some girls ended
 up making just $1,800 for an entire season. 

And yet, like Alyssa's hair coloring, they were made to pay for everything - including their $650 uniforms.

Alyssa
 says that while she thought of quitting the team several times, she 
decided to tough it out until the end of the season because she loved 
the team so much.

'I
 have never been a quitter. Cheering for the Bills was a life long dream
 and I felt it was only right to honor my commitment and not let my 
fellow team mates down,' she said.

But
 now she and four other former cheerleaders are hitting back, suing the 
team, as well as two companies that have managed the cheer squad.

Underpaid: Alyssa (right) and former teammate Maria P (center) appeared in a press conference Tuesday with their lawyer Frank Dolce, and said they were exploited out of '840 hours of work'

On Tuesday, Alyssa and another former squad member, identified as 'Maria P', held a news conference with their attorney, Frank Dolce, explaining how they were each exploited out of '840 hours of work'.

The women say they were wrongly classified as independent contractors by Stejon Productions, which manages the Jills and failed to pay them for hundreds of hours of work during 2012 and 2013 season.

Stejon Productions - the current company managing the Jills - announced that it will be suspending the team pending the lawsuit.
