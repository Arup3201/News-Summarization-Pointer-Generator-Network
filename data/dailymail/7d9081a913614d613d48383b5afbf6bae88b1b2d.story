I met with Carl Froch last week and the first thing I could see is that he is getting itchy knuckles again. This guy wants to fight.

There are a lot of discussions going on at the moment and as it stands it looks to me like a fight with Julio Cesar Chavez is not going to happen. I don’t think Chavez wants to fight anyone at the moment, let alone Carl, who is not at the age where he wants to be waiting around for challengers to say yes or no.

James DeGale is now strong favourite to get the fight, probably in February or March of next year. 

Going, going, gone: Carl Froch knocked out George Groves in May and could now fight James Degale (below)

Winning: DeGale looked impressive as earned the mandatory challenger shot by beating Brandon Gonzales

James is obviously Carl’s mandatory challenger for the IBF super-middleweight belt and under those terms Carl has to fight him by the end of February or give up the belt. Carl is not the sort of fighter who just gives up a belt so I think that fight is now very likely.

I have had some discussions about possible venues and I am looking at a few outdoor stadia, including the City Ground in Nottingham, Carl’s hometown. He has filled big arenas from Manchester to Wembley to the O2 and this is the kind of fight and venue that excites him. We are working on it.

Mikkel Kessler also remains an option, be it for this next fight or the one after. They just have great fights with each other and at 1-1 between the two there is an appetite to justify making it.

But DeGale is the strong favourite at the moment. He is young, hungry and talented. He might make his next appearance on the huge card I am arranging in Sheffield on December 6. After that he could get the big one – like I said, I can’t see Carl vacating a title.

Talks are ongoing over a fight between Kell Brook and Amir Khan. It is going well because I think everyone realises it makes sense. Khan obviously wants a fight with Floyd Mayweather, as does everyone in the division, but he knows that while that fight might never happen, even if it did he would make more money fighting Kell.

Everything so far has been very straightforward and I am in talks with Wembley over a May date. They want us back there as soon as possible after the success of Froch-Groves – I have no doubt in my mind that we would fill that stadium again. I hope to have this tied up in the next month or so.

World champion: Kell Brook beat Shawn Porter to win the IBF welterweight title last month

Connecting: Amir Khan could fight Brook next May after making his welterweight debut against Luis Collazo

In the spirit of huge domestic fights, the massive rematch between Tony Bellew and Nathan Cleverly looks set to happen on December 6 in Sheffield. I am planning a big homecoming card for Kell Brook’s first fight after winning his world title and this fight would sit perfectly alongside it.

You’ll have noticed a bit more needle than usual between Nathan and Tony on Twitter. I spoke to Nathan last week and he quite rightly would rather have the fight at a neutral venue after winning in Liverpool last time.

Coming for you: Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew are almost ready to agree to their rematch

I have always said that I would take the fight to the most commercially attractive venue and until recently that was probably going to be Liverpool. But the option of staging a big card in Sheffield was too good to miss so we will try to go there. I will see Tony this week to go over the details. Both fighters obviously would have preferred to fight in their hometown – this provides a sensible solution and an epic night in Sheffield.

All being well, this brilliant fight will be signed off at the end of this week.

It’s a big couple of weeks for two of the best super-bantamweight fighters in the world. My guy, Scott Quigg, will defend his WBA world title on September 13 in Manchester against Stephane Jamoye, while this weekend Carl Frampton challenges Kiko Martinez for the IBF belt.

I think both British fighters will come through these tests and then they simply must have a unification fight. Forget the politics and whatever rubbish – let’s just make this fight. It is the biggest fight out there for both men.

I have spoken sporadically to the McGuigans over the past six months. When our guys get their next fight out of the way, we need to sit down together, lock ourselves in a room and not come out until it is agreed. This is a fight the public must see.

Josh Warrington has signed a five-fight deal with Matchroom Boxing and I am delighted. This guy is one of the best talents in British boxing. He is 23 and already the Commonwealth and British champion, winning all 18 of his fights. Next up he is against Davide Dieli for the European belt on October 4 in Leeds.

Believe me, this guy is one of the best ticket sellers in the business. He reminds me of a young Ricky Hatton in that respect. When it comes to sales, you tend to have box office sales and sales done by the fighter. This guy sells more than 2,000 himself to his fights. That’s an incredible amount. The best thing is, he delivers most of them in person! He’s a top fighter and a good guy.

Star attraction: Josh Warrington is proving himself to be a big talent... and a big ticket seller
