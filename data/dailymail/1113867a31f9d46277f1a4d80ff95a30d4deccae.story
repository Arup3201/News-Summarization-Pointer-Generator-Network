The mother and sister of Milly Dowler broke down in tears today as Levi Bellfield was finally found guilty of murdering the schoolgirl.

An Old Bailey jury found him guilty of abducting and murdering the 13-year-old after she walked past the killer's home in March 2002.

Bellfield is also facing a charge of attempting to abduct 11-year-old Rachel Cowles the day before he took Milly. No verdict has yet been reached on that charge.

Guilty: Levi Bellfield has been found guilty today of murdering schoolgirl Milly Dowler in 2002

It took Milly's parents Bob and Sally
nine years to get justice, even though her killer had been living 50 
yards from where she was last seen in Station Avenue, Walton-on-Thames, 
Surrey.

Police knocked on the door of 
Bellfield's flat in Collingwood Place, off Station Avenue, 11 times, but
did not try to contact the letting agent to trace him.

Rachel Cowles' mother Diana rang police when a man 
in a red car offered her daughter a lift but it was three years until 
officers interviewed her.

In 2008, he was convicted of murdering two students and the attempted murder of a third.

Milly, 13, vanished on March 21, 2002 in Station Avenue, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, while she walked home from school.

Her remains were found six months 
later in a wood at Yateley Heath, Hampshire, 25 miles away, but the 
cause of death could not be determined.

Bellfield went on to kill again twice before he was arrested by London police two years later.

He
moved his family out of Collingwood Place the day after killing Milly 
and dumping her body 25 miles away in Yateley Heath wood, Hampshire.

Milly's bones were found six months 
later by mushroom pickers. She may have been strangled or suffocated, 
but it was impossible to say.

Bellfield,
a former wheelclamper and bouncer, went on to kill Marsha McDonnell, 
19, Amelie Delagrange, 22, and to attempt to murder Kate Sheedy, 18,
in 2004.

All the attacks 
took place near bus stops on the borders of London and Surrey. There was
no apparent motive except a hatred of women.

Bellfield, 43, was jailed for life for those crimes in February 2008 and was told he would never be released.

He is now due to receive another life
term to run alongside the existing jail sentence in Wakefield prison, 
where he spends most of the day locked in his cell.

Milly's mother and sister Gemma, 25, collapsed in tears after hearing the verdict.

The Dowlers join a tragic list of people whose lives have been devastated by the 6ft 1in bully.

After years of anguish and heartache, they went to court to seek justice, only to have Bellfield imply that Milly's death was their fault.

Happy family: Milly, aged 13, left, with her parents Robert and Sally and sister Gemma, 16 on holiday

They each broke down in the witness 
box in the face of suggestions that Milly might have run away or 
committed suicide because she was unhappy.

For
Mr Dowler, a 59-year-old IT management consultant, there was the added 
humiliation of having to admit that he had an interest in bondage sex, 
and that police found a ball gag at the family home in Walton Park.

Milly had found a porn magazine with contact numbers for women providing kinky sex nine months before her death, and felt let down by Mr Dowler, the court heard.

This led to detectives considering him as a suspect - the first of 54 checked out by Surrey Police over the years.

Bellfield went undetected until his arrest in November 2004 for the murder of Frenchwoman Ms Delagrange.

His partner Emma Mills told detectives they had been living near Station Road and moved out suddenly.

Bellfield's red Daewoo Nexia car, which was seen turning into Station Road 22 minutes after Milly was last seen, has never been found.

As Mrs Dowler was helped from the courtroom, she collapsed.

After being carried out by police officers, Gemma, 25, became uncontrollably emotional outside the courtroom and both her and her mother began wailing and shouting 'guilty'.

Victims: Levi Bellfield murdered Amelie Delagrange, 22, left, in 2004 and Marsha McDonnell in 2003, by beating her over the head in Hampton

Mr Dowler helped to comfort his daughter as the court's matron was called to help both women.

Bellfield showed no reaction to the verdict.

Kate Sheedy, whom Bellfield tried to 
kill in 2004, was in court to hear the verdict, along with the parents 
of Amelie Delagrange.

They looked shocked as they witnessed Mrs Dowler's painful release of emotion.

Bellfield, who was wearing a lilac 
polo shirt, yawned as he was led back to the cells while the jury 
considered the final charge of attempted abduction.
