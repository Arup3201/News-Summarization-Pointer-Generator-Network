His name might not be as recognizable as Cartier or Van Cleef & Arpels, but according to The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Paris-based, American jeweler Joel A. Rosenthal is one of the world's most influential gem artists.

The New York museum is celebrating Rosenthal's JAR atelier with a retrospective - marking the institution's first-ever show dedicated to a living, contemporary jeweler.

Rosenthal is famously reclusive and does not lend his designs for magazine shoots or red carpet appearances, however his jewelry is among some of the world's most sought after auction pieces.

Floral advance: Joel A. Rosenthal is famous for his floral-inspired designs like the 2001 Lilac Brooches (L) and the 2011 Raspberry Brooch (R)

The MET's Jewels by JAR exhibit 
highlights the signatures of Rosenthal’s JAR gem atelier through the 
over 400 exemplary pieces of his work that are on display.

Raised in the Bronx, New York, the 
70-year-old designer is highly regarded for his pavé work– a technique 
that entails setting diminutive gems in even smaller settings to create a
rolling surface of stones.

More than just setting assorted gems, Rosenthal uses pavés as a method for creating multidimensional objects. Much like a painter, he uses various tones of colored stones to shade and highlight the figures he’s setting, which typically take the shape of flowers and butterflies.

Rosenthal’s creative instincts began in needlepoint – another craft in which he is an expert.

He is one of very few jewelers to set his pieces in dark alloy metals, which he says exemplify the hues and shine of his colored gems.

The jeweler is famously reclusive and has only exhibited his work once before, in London. He produces somewhere between 100 and 120 one-of-a-kind pieces a year in the interest of artistry, rather than widespread commercial success.

Incredible auction success: While Rosenthal does not advertise, his items are so coveted that they can fetch more than two times their original price at auction

After graduating from Harvard, 
Rosenthal moved to Paris in 1966 and opened a needlepoint store in the 
French capital with his romantic partner Pierre Jeannet.

While
his handiwork was sought after by design houses including Hermès and 
Valentino, it wasn’t long before Rosenthal’s interest in jewelry rose to
the forefront of his mind.

After clients asked him to reset their finer pieces, Rosenthal decided to reinvest his focus in jewelry and moved back to New York in 1976 to work for Bulgari.

He quickly returned to Paris and 
opened JAR on the Place Vendôme in 1978 as an upstart venture, with just
three rings made from less costly materials like moonstone and coral.

Less than ten years later, Rosenthal 
moves his operations to a larger space in the famous French plaza where 
he continues to operate today, on an appointment-only basis.

Needlepoint start: The designer's formative experience with needlepoint inspires his work like a 1994 Butterfly Brooch (L) and a 2008 Tulip Brooch (R)

Rosenthal has been called the ‘Fabergé
of our time,’ by designer Diane von Furstenberg and the ‘single 
greatest jewelry of our time,’ by former loyal client Ellen Barkin, who 
purchased more than a dozen of his pieces while married to billionaire 
Ron Perelman.

Unlike other jewelry designs which 
depreciate in value after their original purchase, Rosenthal’s creations
have been shown to typically double in value when auctioned.

His investment-worthy proven objects have been favored by Gwyneth Paltrow and Elle MacPherson.

Rosenthal is famously finicky about 
who is allowed to buy his designs, and he is known to refuse purchase 
when he thinks an item is not befitting of its buyer.

The designer is so particular in fact, that for the only other retrospective of his 
work to have ever been staged (at London’s Somerset House in 2002), he 
required that the exhibition space  remain nearly pitch black and for the 
museum to provide each visitor with a flashlight so they could discover 
their own favorite focal points.

He also required that the space be 
scented with his signature JAR scents, which are only presently sold in 
two locations – a small store in Paris and at Bergdorf Goodman in New 
York for $472 per ounce.

The MET exhibit will run until March 9, in the museum’s Helen and Milton A. Kimmelman Gallery.
