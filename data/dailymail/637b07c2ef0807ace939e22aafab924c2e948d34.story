Roy Hodgson has sent a grovelling letter to Amazonian officials in a charm offensive to try and make up for his gaffe criticising the city of Manaus.

The England boss caused a storm before the World Cup draw in December by saying he would most like to avoid the heat and humidity of the jungle city.

The mayor of Manaus then hit back, saying he did not want England to play in the city either – and that he was hoping for a 'better' national side to play there.

England were then drawn to face Italy in Manaus in their opening match on June 14.

No superlative is spared in the letter from Hodgson to Omar Aziz, governor of the state of Amazonas, on FA-headed notepaper and dated January 17.

He uses the phrases 'extremely happy', 'one of the highlights of the tournament', 'wonderful city' and 'dream come true' in his sycophantic letter.

The England boss will visit the city, and its still-unfinished Arena da Amazonia stadium, with FA officials on a still-to-be-decided date in February.

In welcoming the letter, Aziz said: 'Let’s welcome the English with the affection and warmth particular to 
the Amazon. We can show them our natural beauty, costumes and a unique 
cuisine that enhances life expectancy.'

The letter Hodgson sent to Omar Aziz

Dear Governor Omar Aziz,

Everyone
 at the FA is delighted that the England team has qualified for the 2014
 Brazil World Cup, it promises to be a once in a lifetime opportunity.

We
 are extremely happy to be visiting your city as part of our World Cup 
experience; I know the city of Manaus will be a fine location for our 
team to be based ahead of the Group Stage match against Italy.

I
 am particularly keen to make contact with you following last year’s 
media reports about the England vs Italy match in Manaus. I would like 
to put on record that I am looking forward to experiencing your city, 
learning about the culture and history and of course meeting the people!

It promises to be one of the highlights of the tournament for us. I 
plan to visit your city next month on a fact-finding trip with my FA 
colleagues and the British Ambassador to Brazil.

In
 addition, my coaches and I have decided that we would like to stay two 
nights in Manaus before the match against Italy on Saturday 14 and we 
will also stay the night after the game.

Therefore we will look to be 
spending four days in your wonderful city. My colleagues have already 
visited the FIFA-allocated hotel and the Arena da Amazonia and I have 
heard some very promising reports.

I
 am also sure our fans will find your city extremely accommodating and 
become involved in the Brazilian World Cup spirit. We expect to have 
several thousand fans following England in Brazil and their support of 
the national team is second to none. Their enthusiasm and behaviour have
 been exemplary in recent World Cup tournaments (particularly Germany 
2006 and South Africa 2010 with no arrests made) and this is something 
the English FA will work hard to continue in 2010 (sic).

I know that the
 English fans will make a great contribution to the overall tournament.

I
 know that it will be a dream come true for my players to participate in
 the summer’s World Cup and your city is going to play an important part
 in our World Cup adventure.

I am sure that you are as enthusiastic as I am about our forthcoming Group match and look forward to meeting you in due course.

Yours sincerely,Roy HodgsonEngland Manager
