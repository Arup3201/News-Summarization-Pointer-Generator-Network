It could have all been very different for Captain Munnerlyn.

Born three months premature and weighing little more than three pounds, he spent the first three months of his life in an incubator. When he arrived home in the Happy Hill area of Mobile, Alabama, he was housed in a shoebox.

At the age of four, his aunt protected him and took a bullet as a drive-by shooting raged outside their car. Two years later his father was murdered by one of his cousins following a row in a bar.

In 1995, two of his brothers were charged with murder. Gregory, then 15, avoided prison. But Timothy, four years his senior, remains in jail.

He watched Munnerlyn’s last game from his cell. Sadly for both parties, the Minnesota Vikings were humbled 42-10 in Green Bay.

‘It was a bad game. He’s seen me play a couple of times, man. But it wasn’t my best game. It wasn’t our best game as a team. But hopefully he’ll get a chance to come home and see me play in real life,’ says Munnerlyn.

Asked to consider his formative years, the diminutive cornerback reflected: ‘Football definitely was an escape for me. In order to play sports I had to get my grades. I had to stay out of trouble. And my mom was getting calls from the teacher about me being out and being disobedient.

‘So it was kind of like an escape for me to make me behave myself and it made me do the right thing and stay on the right path because I had a goal. And the goal was to be in the NFL. ‘Sometimes I think “man I can’t believe that I made it”. And I have to pinch myself. Man, am I really here. Is this still a dream?’

Munnerlyn was picked in the seventh round of the 2009 draft by the Panthers, but left Carolina in March in free agency, signing a three-year $14.25m deal with the Vikings. He admits to proving people wrong for some time.

‘Oh yeah. I used to always have to do that being a 5ft 9in guy. Saying I could never make the NFL. Don’t have the speed. Don’t have the ability. I just try to come back and work hard each and every day. That’s all I try to do is try to prove people wrong. People was wrong about me. They was wrong about Captain Munnerlyn. I can go out there. I can play in the NFL. I can be a starter. And I can be a difference-maker.’

While he says he is struggling to recapture his best form, he is not afraid to continue to put in the hard yards as the Vikings look to get their season back on track against the Detroit Lions.

‘We watch the game back and we learn from it. We definitely don’t dwell on it. Bad days can happen. We didn’t come out there. We move on. Watch tape, learn from it and move on to Detroit.’

‘I’m trying to take one game at a time and pick up my play. Play better football - I’m trying to pick up my game and get the defense back on the right track,’ says the 26-year-old.

Head coach Mike Zimmer threatened to ‘hurt some feelings’ following the capitulation across the border and while Munnerlyn does not divulge specifics, he does say: ‘He was mad. He was mad,’

‘We came out and we got embarrassed, man. This week he’s been on us even harder. Trying to get us back to basic football. Trying to get us to execute. And go out there and play fast and play tough.

‘He’s got a lot of respect in the locker room, so we’re just trying to go out an play hard for him.’

With Calvin Johnson and Reggie Bush both set to miss the game, Munnerlyn knows the Lions remain a threat, despite Detroit losing 15 of their last 16 games in Minnesota.

‘They bring speed. They are physical. Those guys are great. They are special athletes. Guys like Golden Tate. He’s a good switch up guy for them. They have a very explosive offense and they like making big plays. That’s something we’ve been struggling with on our defense, giving up the big plays. We’ve just got to go out there and we’ve got to execute. We’ve got to have the right mind frame that we’re going to beat guys.’

And with Munnerlyn's lifelong habit of upsetting the odds, it would foolish to back against him.
