Terrifying: James Atkinson, 40, followed frail  Geoffrey Franklin before stabbing him eight times

Callous: The attacker slowly walked away from his victim, who lay in a pool of his own blood

Jailed: Atkinson, left, has been sentenced to 14 years in prison today for the stabbing of Mr Franklin,  right, but was told he would be held beyond that if he is still a threat to the public

Mr Franklin only survived the random attack in the Devon city after passers-by saw him slumped on the floor and called for help.

Atkinson was told today he would never be released from prison while he posed a risk to the public.

Telling the court what had happened to him Mr Franklin said: 'It all happened so quickly. I was just walking along the street minding my own business - the wrong place at the wrong time.

'He didn't say a word he just stabbed me in the side. As I turned to challenge him he stabbed me again in the abdomen.

'I just hope he is kept under proper supervision so that he does not do this to anyone else. The next person will be dead.'

The court heard Mr Franklin was walking to a friend's house on July 23, 2011 when Atkinson walked up from behind him at a street corner.

CCTV footage showed to the court captured the drug addict following Mr Franklin before stopping a few steps behind him to produce a knife.

Mr Franklin, who walks with a stick and has a false eye, was seen battling in vain to fight Atkinson off before being stabbed eight times in the abdomen.

The footage ended with Atkinson calmly walking away as his stunned victim clutched his stomach in disbelief before collapsing.

Lucky to be alive: The 40-year-old followed closely before he jumped in front of the disabled man and stabbed him repeatedly

Tenacious: Mr Franklin tried to fight back against the younger man despite his severe injuries

Hurt: Atkinson then walked away while his victim collapsed to the ground and nearly died

Prosecutor Alistair Verheijen told the court that Mr Franklin suffered a 15cm-long gash which exposed his bowel as well as multiple wounds to his chest and back.

He added: 'One passerby comments that his guts were hanging out.'

Survival: Mr Franklin spent two weeks in hospital and admitted today: 'I'm lucky to be alive

Mr Franklin had part of his small intestine removed by surgeons but was able to leave hospital two weeks later.

Atkinson, of Plymouth, denied wounding Mr Franklin with intent to do him grievous bodily harm but was found guilty by a jury after a trial in October 2012.

His sentence was delayed 18 months while experts assessed his mental health.

Robert Linford, defending, said Atkinson suffered from a personality disorder and was so heavily intoxicated on the night of the knifing he was hearing voices and acting like a 'zombie'.

He told the court: 'To a greater or lesser extent, all three psychiatrists link this man's offence to his mental disorder.'

Judge Paul Darlow handed Atkinson a 14-year prison sentence but said he would only be allowed out when he is deemed not to be a serious threat to the public.

He told the thug he was lucky not to have killed Mr Franklin, adding: 'The attack resulted in his near evisceration. He required life-saving surgery.

'He was a complete stranger to you and you had no reason to attack him.'

Mr Franklin, a former Debenhams worker, lost his eye in 1976 and suffers from a long-term illness that effects his balance.

He added after the sentencing: 'I am lucky to be alive. I am just glad that two passersby called an ambulance.

'There was an ambulance nearby. Another ten minutes and I would have been dead. It could have happened to anybody. I just happened to be walking down the road.

'Some of my wounds still give me trouble. I am a bit more cautious, but I still go out. It has been horrendous waiting for this case to come to an end. I am so grateful that it has.'
