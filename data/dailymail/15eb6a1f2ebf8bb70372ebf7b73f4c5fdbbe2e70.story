Experts believe they can save as many as 20,000 lives with a free yearly lung cancer screening.

The decision was made by the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF), which  is comprised of 16 healthcare experts who make recommendations about preventative services. 

The task force gave the preventative 
service a 'B' rating, meaning that under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, 
qualified Medicare and private insurance patients could receive the annual 
screening free of charge.

For now, the grade is just a draft recommendation and open for public comment until August 26. After that, it will take three to six months for the final recommendation to be instituted by health care providers.

Lifesaver: The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force announced yesterday that they are recommending free lung cancer screenings for those at the highest risk of contracting the disease

Lung cancer is the deadliest cancer - 
killing about 160,000 people a year - because symptoms usually don't 
appear until it's too late.

Screenings for the disease are rare, because until recently health care professionals weren't sure a CT scan could accurately find the cancer early enough to make a difference.

But recent studies show that the early screening can, and does, save lives.

In 2010, the National Cancer Institute held a large-scale trial involving 53,000 patients using a CT scan that detected smaller tumors.

They found that the screening could reduce the lung cancer mortality rate by 16 per cent among those at the highest risk of getting lung cancer.

Dr Claudia Henschke of the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York was part of a study that pushed for early screenings. She says this decision is going to make a big difference in how many people die from the disease.

Game changer: The task force estimates that as many as 20,000 of the 160,000 people diagnosed with lung cancer every year could be saved with early detection

'Back in 1999 when we published our results, we were very confident that it was going to make a big difference,' Dr Henschke told NBC News. 'Now, finally, it will be made available to those people who are at highest risk. I am thrilled.'

These findings were used as evidence in the task force's recommendation Monday.

Nine million current and former smokers will be eligible for the yearly screening. Senior citizens are a priority with current smokers 55 to 80 eligible for the procedure. Former heavy smokers who quit less than 15 years ago, those who smoked a pack a day for 30 years, and patients who smoked three packs a day for 10 years, fall into the group.

Task leader Dr Michael LeFevre told Fox News that the yearly screenings can save 'a substantial number of lung cancer deaths' - an estimated 20,000 of the 160,000 that happen each year in the U.S.

Some are afraid this will only encourage current smokers to continue smoking if they're eligible for a free screening.

But the lung cancer test is enough to make current smokers quit. 

The yearly screening involves a CT scan. If a spot shows up on the scan it could mean cancer, but it could also be emphysema, an infection or nothing.

Risky: The screenings save lives, but also involve a lung biopsy to confirm the cancer which can collapse the lung and cause death as well

Doctors must perform a lung biopsy in order to confirm the cancer. This means inserting a needle into the chest and lungs to retrieve a sample. The procedure is borth painful and risky, and can cause the lung to collapse.

A study at the National Lung Screening Trial found that for every five to six lives saved by the screening, one person died from procedures done in the screening - including collapsed lungs caused by biopsies.

Dr Harold E Varmus, the director of the National Cancer Institute, told the New York Times that the recommendation should not 'change the way people think about lunch cancer.'

'The main message is unchanged,' he said. 'Don't smoke.'
