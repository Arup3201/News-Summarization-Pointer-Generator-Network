An 18-year-old who was beaten unconscious by the father of his alleged sexual assault victim pleaded not guilty in court today.

Teenager Raymond Frolander pleaded not guilty to sexual battery on a child under 12 at his arraignment on Thursday morning in Volusia County, Florida. He is being held without bond. 

In a recent mugshot, Frolander's face appeared to have healed after his initial booking photo which showed his puffed lips, swollen eyes and bloody mouth after a beating by father Jason Browning.

Mr Browning and his family attended court today. He told Click Orlando: 'Our family is ripped apart. My daughters don't even know how to hug or kiss their brother anymore.'

Frolander is scheduled for a pretrial hearing in September before his trial begins in November.

According to a Facebook post by the child's grandmother, Norma Jean Browning, the alleged victim will have to testify at Frolander's trial. She asked friends to remember her grandson in their prayers.

Browning admitted he 'just snapped' when he allegedly walked in on Frolander naked with his son. 

Shortly after beating the teen unconscious, he went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife, he said.

'I was going to kill him,' Browning admitted but said that his son's pleas stopped him.

Frolander later admitted to Florida police that he has been molesting the boy for three years. The 18-year-old was considered family by the Brownings and often spent time with the 11-year-old boy, the father said.

'There was nothing uncommon to let the kids go in the bedroom and play video games together and now I have to wonder why the door was shut,' Mr Browning said.  

The father was not charged with a crime and police appeared to understand his reaction.

'Dad was acting like a dad. I don't see anything we should charge the dad with,' Daytona Beach Police Chief Mike Chitwood told WFTS last month.

This picture was posted on July 28 on a Facebook page called 'Raymond Frolander Is Innocent'. The individual who posted the picture claims that it was taken by Browning while he beat Frolander for allegedly assaulting his son on July 18

Jason Browning beat Frolander into a pulp after allegedly finding him performing a sex act on his son last month. He said outside court today that his family's life had been 'ripped apart' 

'You have an 18-year-old who has clearly picked his target, groomed his target and had sex with the victim multiple times.'

A subsequent mugshot showed Frolander had been badly beaten around the face, leaving him with swollen lips and eyes, bruising and lacerations.

At the time of the 911 call in the early hours of July 18, the dispatcher asked Browning if any weapons were involved in the assault he had called in.

Browning responded: 'My foot and my fist.'

He told the dispatcher: 'I just walked in on a grown man molesting [name redacted]. And I got him in a bloody puddle for you right now, officer.'

Police arrived at the Daytona Beach home in Florida to find Frolander unconscious.

'He is nice and knocked out on the floor for you, I dragged him into the living room,' the father said. 'Send an ambulance. He is going to need one.'

The dispatcher asked: 'Is he still unconscious?' to which the father responds: 'Yes... I hit hard, sir.'

He said that Frolander was a 'damn lucky boy that I love my God'.

The father added: 'He stood up and his pants were around his ankles and nothing else needed to be said. I did whatever I got a right to do except I didn’t kill him.'

The father had left his home around 1am to pick up some food and when he returned, heard a strange noise coming from the bedroom, police said.

He pushed open the door and allegedly found Frolander with his pants down performing a sex act on the child.

The boy told investigators he had been playing video games with friends but when they left, Frolander took him to a back room and pulled down his pants. He also said Frolander had been abusing him for three years.

Daytona Beach police chief Michael Chitwood told MailOnline that Frolander had a close family connection to the alleged victim.

The chief said he believed that Frolander lived next door to the boy and his father. The suspect was living with the victim's biological mother. Frolander's stepmother is also engaged to the victim's father.

The police chief said the young boy was intimidated and told by Frolander that terrible things would happen if he revealed the abuse.

Chief Chitwood said: 'He's 11 years old, he should be running around outside and playing video games, not dealing with something like this.'
