The man accused of going on a deadly rampage apparently targeting TSA agents inside Los Angeles International Airport has been named as Paul Anthony Ciancia.

A motive 
for the fatal shooting wasn't clear but Ciancia was wearing fatigues and carrying a bag 
containing a handwritten note that said he 'wanted to kill TSA and 
pigs' and that may have made a reference to a conspiracy theory about a totalitarian force trying to take over the world, according to a federal official who wished to remain anonymous.

Friends and former classmates are now trying to connect the quiet young man who was sometimes the target of bullies, with the apparent anti-government attacker who opened fire and killed a TSA agent.

Identified: Paul Anthony Ciancia has been named as the gunman in the LAX airport shooting

Caught: Ciancia, who was shot in the head during a standoff with police, was handcuffed to a gurney

'He kept to himself and ate lunch alone a lot,' said former classmate David Hamilton, who attended Salesianum School with Ciancia.

'I really don’t remember any one person who was close to him.... In four years, I never heard a word out of his mouth,' Hamilton told The Los Angeles Times.

'He was quiet and people would take advantage of that.'

Welfare check: Officers visited Ciancia's apartment after his father raised concerns

Another 
former classmate; Jeff Skidmore, said that Ciancia may have had a speech
impediment and did not like speaking in front of the class. Skidmore 
told the paper that he did not remember Ciancia ever being bullied, 
saying instead that he was just left alone by his peers.

A different federal official said that it was clear from the note that he expected to die in the standoff.

'This was clearly a suicide mission... he did not expect to walk away from this,' the official told USA Today.

The 23-year-old gunman is said to 
have has strong anti-government views and sent a text to his brother 
this morning saying he was thinking about taking his own life.

CNN reports
that his text to his brother was not the first one that he had sent in 
recent days that scared family members. In others, which were sent to 
his brother and father, Ciancia was said to have rambled about his 
negative outlook on life, his disgust with the government and his 
disappointment with his life in Los Angeles.

Relatives
were concerned about the latest suicidal text, so they contacted the 
local New Jersey police station, who called their Los Angeles 
counterparts and ordered a 'welfare check' for Ciancia. Police went to 
his apartment and spoke to his two roommates before signing off and 
telling the New Jersey police that everything was fine.

Little did they know that as they were making that phone call, Ciancia had started shooting at LAX.

Ciancia,
an American citizen with a minor criminal record, was arrested after an
armed confrontation with police and taken to a hospital, where he is 
listed in critical condition after reportedly being shot in the face.

The gunman, who was raised in Pennsville, New Jersey, is accused of shooting dead
a safety screener with a high-powered assault rifle and wounding 
several others before being apprehended by police, according to 
officials.

He was pictured handcuffed to a gurney as he was escorted out of the airport after being shot multiple times by responding officers. 

Investigation: Police gather at the New Jersey home of Ciancia's father

According 
to ABC, Ciancia's brother received a 'worrying' text from him before the
shooting, which prompted their father to call the police station to 
warn them of the possible threat to his own life.

Los
Angeles police went to Ciancia's apartment for a welfare check, and 
spoke to the 23-year-old's roommates, who said when they last saw him on
Thursday he had been fine.

Victim: Gerardo I. Hernandez was shot and killed by a gunman at the Los Angeles International Airport on Friday

The
officers reported back to headquarters that there was nothing to be 
worried about but, unbeknown to them, as they made that call Ciancia had
already opened fire in LAX.

There was one fatality in the shooting: Gerardo I. Hernandez, a 39-year-old father-of-two who had been working at Los Angeles International Airport for three years.

Friends and family have begun paying 
their respects to the slain public servant, saying that he was a loving 
husband and caring father who enjoyed spending his free time with his children.

The
shooting makes Hernandez the first TSA agent shot and killed in the 
line of duty. One of his colleagues was also shot in the Friday rampage 
but that individual is expected to make a full recovery.

NBC's
Pete Williams reported that the 23-year-old suspect may have anti-government views based on the literature he 
was carrying.

A neighbor of Ciancia's, Whitney Hankins, 18, who went to Pennsville
Memorial High School with him, said the family were very quiet and kept to
themselves, especially after the 2009 death of the mother Susan, who suffered
from MS for years.

‘I didn’t know him personally as he was a few years older
than me,’ she said. ‘But I would see him around school and the neighborhood.

Warning signs: Ciancia sent a text message to his brother on Friday morning saying he wanted to kill himself

Loner: Neighbors of Ciancia say the 23-year-old was quiet and shy

'He was kinda strange, very quiet and shy. Wouldn’t really make eye contact or
talk much. Though I would never have expected him to do anything like this.
Some of the girls on the street called him “the creepy guy”.’

The motive for the Friday morning 
shooting has not been confirmed, but a note thought to be written by the
gunman is shedding some light on his thought process.

Shooter
Paul Anthony Ciancia had 'anti-government' leanings and was reportedly 
carrying a note which said that he 'wanted to kill TSA and pigs'. 

The
Los Angeles Times reported that in a note found in his bag, he wrote 
about his 'disappointment with government' and how he did not intend to 
injure any civilians, only federal employees.

Sources also added that the note was signed with the letters 'NWO' which stands for 'New World Order'.

The
conspiracy theory of a 'new world order' asserts that there is a secret
group of powerful individuals who used their money and global influence
to eventually gain control of the world.

The
concept of the New World Order has many different strains that have 
evolved over time, and has come to include mysterious elite groups like 
the Illuminati and the Freemasons.

Some
of the more radical conspiracy theorists believe that the secret 
members of the New World Order will order a coordinated coup d'etat in 
the United States and other powerful countries using black helicopters 
and implement a totalitarian regime to control the world.

Whitney said in the tight-knit middle-class neighborhood,
the Ciancia’s house was set back into the woods and was ‘humungous’ compared to
others on the street.

‘We just assumed they were really wealthy because they have
a really big house compared to the others and his dad owns an auto shop up the
street.

'It’s a really small town and everyone knows everyone else’s business.
But everyone just kind of left them alone after the mom died.’

The Pennsville Police Department has had no dealings with the younger Ciancia, Cummings said.

He and neighbors described the Ciancias as a good, nice family.

Ciancia graduated in 2008 from Salesianum School, an all-boys Roman Catholic school in Wilmington, Delaware, across the Delaware River from Pennsville, the school said.

The suspect's father has been involved with Pennsville's Fraternal Order of Police, said neighbor Orlando Pagan, a lieutenant in nearby Penns Grove. He didn't provide details on his involvement.

Outside the father's home Friday in Pennsville, a police cruiser blocked the long driveway.

Phone calls weren't answered, and efforts to reach siblings were also unsuccessful.

Orlando Pagan's 17-year-old son Josh said that he would sometimes encounter Ciancia at orthodontist appointments, but that it had been at least two years since the last one.

'He was never weird toward me. He 
never gave me any weird vibes,' he said, adding that in the 10 years he 
has lived across the street from the Ciancia family, 'they've been 
nothing but nice to us.'

Witness
Leon Saryan told ABC News Radio that a ‘fairly young’ man armed with a 
rifle fired about 20 rounds as he made his way down a hallway before 
confronting a TSA agent.

The screener, who was holding Saryan's shoes, was shot and wounded, he told ABC.

The witness recalled that the suspect faced him and asked, ‘Are you TSA?’

‘He saw me. He looked at me with a quizzical look and said, “TSA?” And I just shook my head. So he moved on,’ Saryan said. 

FBI agents and LAPD anti-terrorism 
officials were on the scene at Terminal 3, but sources said they do not 
believe the suspect was connected to any known terrorist groups, calling
him a lone shooter.

LAX 
Police Chief Patrick Gannon told reporters that the gunman entered 
Terminal 3 at 9.20am local time, pulled an assault rifle out of his bag 
and opened fire.

He shot 
his way through the safety screening area and moved deeper into the 
terminal. Officers who responded to reports of shots fired tracked the 
man to a Burger King and shot him.
