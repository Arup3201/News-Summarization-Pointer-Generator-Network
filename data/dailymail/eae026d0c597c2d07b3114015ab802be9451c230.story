It is a stag do that will put a weekend in Prague to shame, but you'll need wealthy friends if you want to book it.

A travel company is launching a 'Million Pound Stag Party'  aimed at Premier League footballers, investment bankers and lottery winners.

The once in a lifetime celebration includes travel in private jets and first class flights to several of the world’s most lavish and decadent cities, as well as a  trip in a £4million superyacht to a private Caribbean island. 

Monaco or bust! StagWeb describes its million pound package as 'the trip of a lifetime'

The new holiday is being offered by StagWeb, a company which was formed 12 years ago to offer 'Stag Dos of Legendary Proportions' for those looking for something a bit special.

Billed as 'the finest pre-wedding shindig known to stag-kind' the worldwide jaunt will whisk ten men from Scotland to Las Vegas, Miami, Barcelona and the Caribbean, and includes a stay in a 16th-century castle and on a luxury private island. 

Priced at £1 million for the package, for £100,000 each, the stags will be welcomed into the world’s most exclusive night clubs and casinos and have their every whim catered for by private waiting staff.

Rare whisky (a £5,000 18 year old malt whisky) and the best vodka, rum and champagne are offered along with fine dining experiences at the world’s most exclusive restaurants.

Activities on the exclusive pre-marital celebration include driving supercars in Monaco, going big game fishing in the Caribbean, courtside NBA basketball seats, diving with sharks, Nascar racing, a private box for Barcelona vs Real Madrid in Spain and to top it all, the stags will be made bona fide Lords in Scotland.

The pre-wedding party 'for stags who demand a little more luxury' includes private jet travel across the globe

Your own private island in the Caribbean is the location for two days on this whistlestop tour

Managing director of StagWeb, Steve Roddy, explains, 'Stag dos have become increasingly lavish in recent years so we wanted to create the most decadent and extreme package imaginable... This is a quite remarkable pre-wedding party for stags who demand a little more luxury.'
