A mixed martial arts fighter in New Mexico may face charges after authorities say he fended off four home invaders - killing one and severely injuring another - during a an early morning break in on New Year's Day.

According to authorities in Dora Ana County, MMA fighter Joe Torrez fatally beat and stabbed one of the intruders, beat another so badly he needed to be taken from Torrez's home in an ambulance and then convinced the other two to retreat in fear.

Authorities found the body of 25-year-old Sal Garces near Torrez's trailer home in the 600 block of King James Avenue.

New Years: Torrez was home with his young son and fiance when the intruders burst into his home early New Years Day

Garces, his 19-year-old brother Raymond Garces, 20-year-old Nathan Avalos and 22-year-old Leonard Calvillo forced their way into 27-year-old Torrez's house about 2 a.m. on New Year's day.

Once inside the home, a fight began between the intruders and Torrez - a fight that ended with Garces dead, Avalos being admitted to a hospital with 'severe' facial injuries and the other two fleeing the scene.

The younger Garces and Calvillo were arrested shortly after the altercation, while Avalos was taken into custody at the hospital.

Threat: Leonard Calvillo threatened Torrez in a phone call before storming into his home with his three friends

What led to the fatal fight are unclear, but Raymond Garces told police the group had gone to Torrez's home after a previous altercation, according to court documents first obtained by Las Cruces Sun News.

Court records claim that Torrez was in the home with his young son, fiance and friends when his fiance's sister arrived claiming to have been 'jumped.'

Torrez then received a threatening call from Calvillo.

'I'm big Eastside,' Calvillo reportedly said, referring to a gang. '...
 I'll kill you and your family ... I will go to your house.'

Each of the four intruders, authorities said, are known gang members.

Shortly after the threatening phone call, the people inside heard a 'huge bang outside.'

Within a matter of seconds the four intruders were in the house.

One of the men, a witness told police, was armed with a 'crude shank.' Another grabbed a knife after entering the home.

An attorney for Torrez, C.J. McElhinney, says his client was acting in self-defense when he fought off the intruders.

'He was fighting for his life,' said McElhinney.

After the fight, Raymond Garces and Calvillo fled, authorities said. Las Cruces police helped deputies locate and arrest them, according to a news release. Both men face several felony charges. Avalos has not been charged, but the case is still under investigation.

Calvillo has been charged with aggravated battery, two counts of conspiracy and criminal damage to property. Raymond Garces was charged with two counts of conspiracy and criminal damage to 
property. He was being held at the detention center on a $10,000 secured
 bond.

Authorities haven't ruled out charging Torrez with any crimes. A Facebook page has been setup in support of the MMA fighter.
