Author Dan Brown once tried to expose 'secrets' of the Catholic Church in his bestseller The Da Vinci Code, and now a collection of never-seen-before documents held by the Vatican are set to go on display in the new year.

The mystery novel claimed that a hidden archive in Rome had proof of Jesus' bloodline through Mary Magdalene and was kept out hidden by the Knights Templar.

But now, various texts in the archive library, which include letters written by popes and princes are to be unveiled to the public despite being preserved for centuries.

The writings, the earliest of which date back to the 8th century, offer an insight into the lives of Henry VIII, Martin Luther and Galileo amongst others.

Father Federico Lombardi, the Vatican's spokesman said: 'It's an exceptional event. It's the first time that an exhibition of such significance has been organised.

'Never have so many documents from the Secret Archive been allowed to leave the Vatican,' he added in The Daily Telegraph.

British archivists will be particularly keen on letters penned by Mary Queen of Scots a matter of weeks before here execution.

She was rumoured to have been involved in a plot that surfaced around 1571 to assassinate Elizabeth I

However after the letters to were found, she was sentenced to her death and was beheaded at Fotheringay Castle on February 8th 1587.

Exposed: The archive includes letters from Parliament attempting to annul Henry VIII's marriage to Catherine of Aragon

Other documents of interest include an intervention from Parliament in an attempt to voidÂ  Henry VIII's marriage to Catherine of Aragon in 1509.

The entire library is believed to be marked 'Archivio Segreto Vaticano' literally translated as The Vatican's Secret Archive.

Revealed', and will commence in early February 2012, running through to September, in the Capitoline 
Museums in Rome.
