Two solar-powered Nasa spacecraft will fire their engines starting on New Year's Eve to slow into an orbit round the moon.

The washing-machine-sized Grail craft are to 'map' the interior of the moon by scanning its gravity field - measured by its effects on the flight paths of the the two craft.

It's a mission that Nasa described as a 'journey to the centre of the moon', and will map the moon's interior 100 to 1000 times more accurately than any previous moon mission.

Nasa's Grail spacecraft will fire their engines to move into orbit on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day - the twin probes will eventually orbit at just 35 miles up and will 'map' the moon's gravity by measuring its effects on their flight paths

The twin spacecraft have been travelling to the moon since launching from the Florida coast in September - a leisurely journey over a distance that took the Apollo astronauts just three days.

'Both spacecraft have performed essentially flawlessly since launch, but one can never take anything for granted in this business,' said mission chief scientist Maria Zuber of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

On New Year’s Eve, one of the Grail probes - short for Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory - will fire its engine to slow down so that it can be captured into orbit. This move will be repeated by the other the following day.

Engineers said the chances of the probes overshooting are slim since their trajectories have been precise. But things could still go wrong.

Cosmic rays might interfere with the probes' engine burn and they won’t get boosted into the right orbit.

'I know I’m going to be nervous,' said project manager David Lehman of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the $496 million, three-month mission.

Once in orbit, the spacecraft will spend the next two months flying in formation and chasing one another around the moon until they are about 35 miles above the surface with an average separation of 124 miles. Data collection will begin in March.

Previous missions have attempted to measure lunar gravity with mixed success. Grail is the first mission dedicated to this goal.

As the probes circle the moon, regional changes in the lunar gravity field will cause them to speed up or slow down.

This in turn will change the distance between them. Radio signals transmitted by the spacecraft will measure the slight distance gaps, allowing researchers to map the underlying gravity field.

Using the gravity information, scientists can deduce what’s below or at the lunar surface such as mountains and craters and may help explain why the far side of the moon is more rugged than the side that faces Earth.

The probes are officially known as 
Grail-A and Grail-B. Several months ago, NASA hosted a contest inviting 
schools and students to submit new names. The probes will be christened 
with the winning names after the second orbit insertion, Zuber said.

'Grail, simply put, is a journey to the centre of the moon' said Ed Weiler, head of Nasa's science mission.

Lead scientist, Maria Zuber said of the mission, 'It
will probe the interior of the moon and map its gravity field 100 to 
1,000 times better than ever before. We will learn more about the 
interior of the moon with Grail than all previous lunar missions 
combined,' Weiler said.

Zuber,
the Grail mission's principal investigator and a planetary scientist at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the precise lunar 
gravity measurements will help her and other planetary scientists better
understand how the moon evolved over the past 4 billion years.

The findings also 
should help identify the composition of the moon's core: whether it's 
made of solid iron or possibly titanium oxide.

Another
puzzle that Grail may help solve, Zuber said, is whether Earth once had
a smaller second moon. Astronomers have speculated that some of the 'landmarks' on the moon's surface are a result of a collision with a second, smaller moon.

Knowing
where the moon's gravity is stronger will enable the United States and 
other countries to better pinpoint landing locations for future 
explorers, whether robot or human. The gravity on the moon is uneven and
about one-sixth Earth's pull.

'If
you want to land right next to a particular outcrop (of rock), you're 
going to be able to do it. There will be no reason to do another gravity
experiment of the moon in any of our lifetimes.'

Zuber
said the Grail findings should eliminate cliffhangers like the Apollo 
11 landing in 1969 by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.

They
overshot their touchdown site in part because of the subtle gravity 
changes in the moon's surface below; they almost ran out of fuel before 
safely touching down on the Sea of Tranquility.
