Lawyers for the last British prisoner in the Guantanamo Bay detention centre have filed a motion for his release after a medical evaluation diagnosed him with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and other 'psychiatric symptoms'.

Shaker Aamer has been imprisoned at the U.S. naval base in Cuba for 12 years, despite twice being cleared for release.

The father-of-four, from Battersea, south London, was arrested by Afghan militias working for the Americans shortly after the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan.

He has now been diagnosed with PTSD following an assessment by Dr Emily Keram at the prison.

The doctor said Mr Aamer had 'additional psychiatric symptoms related to his current confinement... which also gravely diminish his mental health.'

She said Mr Aamer also showed evidence of paranoia and depression during the five day evaluation.

'The length, uncertainty and stress of Mr Aamer's confinement has caused significant disruptions in his... ability to function,' she said. 'He is profoundly aware of what he has lost.'

She concludes: 'The chronic and severe psychiatric symptoms described above have gravely diminished Mr Aamerâ€™s mental health.

'In order to maximize his prognosis, Mr Aamer requires psychiatric treatment, as well as reintegration into his family and society and minimization his re-exposure to trauma and reminders of trauma.'

The medical evaluation, requested by Mr Aamer's legal team, including Clive Stafford Smith, the director of legal action charity Reprieve, also detailed physical disorders, including severe oedema, debilitating headaches, asthma and chronic urinary retention.

Mr Aamer, who has never seen his youngest son as he was born after his capture in Afghanistan, has previously said his only desire is to be reunited with his family in London.

Mr Aamer's lawyers filed a motion in a court in Washington D.C. yesterday requesting his immediate release in light of the report's findings.

Mr Stafford Smith also sent a copy of the report to Foreign Secretary William Hague, requesting an amicus curiae (friend of the court) brief in support of the motion.

Mr Stafford Smith said: 'This desperate news about Shaker's mental and physical state comes on top of twelve years of abuse, and it's hardly surprising to learn from an independent doctor that he is suffering severe PTSD in Guantanamo.

'Shaker has described himself as a rusty old car that is falling apart. There is no reason he should not have come home to his wife and kids when he was cleared, seven years ago.'

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'Mr Aamerâ€™s case remains a high priority for the UK Government and we continue to make clear to the US that we want him released and returned to the UK as a matter of urgency.'

According to the BBC, the U.S. has reportedly only cleared him for transfer to Saudi Arabia.

In July last year, comedian Frankie Boyle went on a hunger strike in solidarity with Mr Aamer in a bid to provoke debate about his human rights.

Boyle was among a number of people who were taking it in turns to go for a week without eating to show support for Mr Aamer, who is a legal, permanent resident of the UK and is married to a British national.

In October it was reported Guantanamo Bay prisoner Ibrahim Idris was to be released after being deemed severely mentally ill.

US District Judge Royce Lamberth issued a release order for Mr Idris, a native of Sudan who had been held as an enemy combatant but not formally charged.

He had spent much of his time at a psychiatric ward on the US naval base since he arrived more than 11 years earlier.

The decision came after the laywers for the US Department of Justice filed court papers indicating the government would no longer oppose his release.

The filing did not specifically say why the government decided to drop its objection. Idris' lawyers had repeatedly argued his illness was so severe he could not pose a security threat.
