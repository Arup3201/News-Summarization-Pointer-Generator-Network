As the devious Thomas Cromwell, he cuts an imposing figure charting the treacherous waters of the Tudor court.

But away from the set of Wolf Hall, Mark Rylance looks a touch less impressive stepping out of his tiny electric car.

The 55-year-old actor was spotted zipping around South London in his small blue G-Wiz, which sells for around £10,000.

The sticker appeared to read ‘The F word is a dirty word’, an allusion to swearing, but smaller print after the F making clear the word was fracking

And the environmentally conscious star of the BBC drama also made his views known by showing an anti-fracking slogan in his back window. The sticker appeared to read ‘The F word is a dirty word’, an allusion to swearing, but smaller print after the F making clear the word was fracking.

The process of drilling down into the ground to release natural gas has become a controversial topic among environmental campaigners.

Rylance has never been one to hide his strong opinions on such issues. He was the main signatory of a letter to the Guardian in 2012 protesting at BP's sponsorship of the World Shakespeare Festival.

It read: 'While the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon spill continues to devastate ecosystems and communities, and the highly polluting extraction of tar sands oil brings us rapidly closer to the point of no return from climate change, we feel that BP has no place in arts sponsorship.' He again set his sights on the oil company when it was announced as a sponsor of the London 2012 Olympic Games, for which he was due to take part in the opening ceremony.

Although he eventually pulled out because of the death of his stepdaughter, he admitted to almost pulling out over what he saw as morally dubious sponsorship deals.

He told Radio 4's Today programme: 'I thought about it. The conversation about private sponsorship being supported by taxpayer' money, and private sponsorship from companies that are not really necessarily behaving all that ethically, big questions about BP, and big questions about McDonald's and the amount of sugar and obesity that's costing the NHS billions...

'I think those questions are good and I had thought since agreeing that maybe maybe I shouldn't be doing this, and if people feel critical of us who are taking part, I think they've got a point, a very good point.

'On the other hand, all these athletes, the human endeavour aspect of it is so wonderful, I wouldn't want to stop, and I wouldn't want to be a nay-sayer or a chastiser.'
