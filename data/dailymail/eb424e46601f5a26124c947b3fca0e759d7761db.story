A poster advertising Rihanna’s perfume Rogue has been banned in areas where children are likely to see it because it presents the pop star in a 'sexually suggestive' way.

The advert features an image of the Barbados-born singer sitting on the floor with her head and shoulders leaning against a wall and her legs raised against a large bottle of perfume.

The Advertising Standards Agency said it imposed a placement restriction on the poster, which was produced on behalf of perfume company Parlux Fragrances, after a single complaint that it was offensively sexual, demeaning to women and featured images not suitable for children to see.

Unsuitable: The restricted advert features an image Rihanna sitting on the floor with her head and shoulders leaning against a wall and her legs raised against a large bottle of perfume

Parlux Fragrances said they had received no other complaints, adding that Rihanna was known for her provocative songs and persona, which the advert sought to capture

The company said it had done so without featuring improper nudity or offensive or suggestive imagery, adding that the majority of women would not consider the photo of Rihanna demeaning.

Rather, they claim, Rihanna is depicted as being in a position of power, as indicated by the name Rogue, which the company claims suggests 'one with the courage to challenge boundaries'.

The Advertising Standards Authority noted that the image showed Rihanna wearing clothes, and showed her looking directly at the viewer with an expression 'of defiance rather than vulnerability'.

It said the overall impression of the singer was one of confidence, and concluded that the ad was 'unlikely to be demeaning to women or to cause serious or widespread offence'.

Controversy: The Advertising Standards Agency said a single complaint was made saying Rihanna's advert was offensively sexual, demeaning to women and featured images not suitable for children

Parlux Fragrances said Rihanna was known for her provocative songs and persona. On Monday the singer left nothing to the imagination in a racy dress at the annual Council of Fashion Designers of America Awards

However it noted that the advert was not given a placement restriction and had appeared in a number of places where it was likely to be seen by children.

In a statement the Advertising Standards Authority said: 'While we did not consider the image to be overtly sexual, we considered that Rihanna’s pose, with her legs raised in the air, was provocative.'

'Because of this, and the fact that Rihanna appeared to be naked except for high heels, we concluded that the ad was sexually suggestive and should have been given a placement restriction to reduce the possibility of it being seen by children.'

It ruled that the ad must not appear again without a placement restriction to reduce the possibility of it being seen by children.

Not the first time: To promote her perfume 'Rebelle' in June 2012, this large poster showing a completely nude Rihanna was erected in New York's Times Square

Risque: 'Nude', another perfume released  in 2012, featured an advert showing Rihanna wearing nothing but cream lace lingerie, a piece of gauze fabric draped strategically over her crotch

It is not the first time an advert featuring Rihanna has caused controversy.

To promote her perfume 'Rebelle' in June 2012, a large poster showing a completely nude Rihanna was erected in New York's Times Square.

'Nude', another perfume released later that year, featured an advert showing Rihanna wearing nothing but cream lace lingerie, a piece of gauze fabric draped strategically over her crotch.

She posted the image on her Twitter account, accompanied by the caption: 'Make sure you smell sexy, especially naked, this fall.'

Also in 2012 the cosmetic tycoon Stefan Heidenreich - the head of Nivea’s parent firm Beiersdorf - complained that the brand had been tainted by the singer promoting its products.

Branding her 'too sexy', Heidenreich said the singer should have been considered a 'no go' for the brand’s family image.

Rihanna has also appeared in racy advertisements for Armani, Budweiser, Mac and French fashion range Balmain,
