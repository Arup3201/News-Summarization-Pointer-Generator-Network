These are the first pictures of the two teenage boys seriously injured after their carriage on a spinning fairground ride broke off and flipped over.

Danny Keogh and Conor Baker, both 16, were on the spinning Mega Bounce Frog ride at Billy Bates Fairground in Leicester when the terrifying accident happened on Saturday evening.

One boy was catapulted into the air, while the other was crushed under the weight of the car.

Accident: Conor Baker, left, and Danny Keogh, right, both 16, were spinning on the Mega Bounce Frog ride at Billy Gates Fairground in Leicester when the accident happened and both were seriously injured

Yesterday Danny was in intensive care and had surgery after suffering a broken arm, ribs and chest injuries.

Conor was treated for a broken nose and teeth.

Fairground-goers were horrified to see the accident on the ride, which was filled with children.

After the ride was halted, parents anxiously pulled their screaming youngsters from the seats.

Zimran Ilyas was filming friends on the ride and captured the moment on video as it happened, at 6.30pm.

Danger: A grab from video footage shows the ride starting to tip (circled). The ride had a number of carriages and was spinning at low level gathering speed when it broke - before extending high into the air

Injured: One of the teenagers is seen crawling from the fairground ride.
One witness said people were screaming and crying and were shouting 
'stop the ride' and one said it was like the film Final Destination

Help: One of the teenagers turns to look for help after the accident. Their carriage reportedly flew off and hit the barriers in front of horrified onlookers. First aiders rushed to the scene to treat their injuries

The 18-year-old from Leicester, said: 'People around me were screaming and crying. I couldn’t believe what I’d just seen.

'People were screaming ‘stop the ride’ over and over.'

The
ride, which has a number of carriages, was spinning at a low level 
gathering speed when the ride broke - before extending high into the 
air.

Jatinder Virdee, from Braunstone, Leicestershire, was watching his niece, 11, and nephew, seven, on the ride when the 'nightmare' unfolded.

He said: 'It was like something from the horror film Final Destination - totally shocking.

Unsuspecting: The two boys can be seen in the centre (green t-shirt) as the ride begins to speed up

'The ride had gone round about three times and then the bit carrying two youngsters flew off into the barriers.

'That was when the mayhem started. Everybody was screaming. It was a nightmare.

'I pulled my niece and nephew off the rides. They were distraught, along with my two-year-old daughter and four-year-old nephew who was watching with me.'

First-aiders at the fairground attended to the boys who attend a school in the city.

In hospital: Danny Keogh, left, who is being treated for arms, ribs and chest injuries, and Conor Baker, right, who is being treated for a broken nose and teeth. The ride has now been dismantled

Fairground director Kennedy Bates said he had been in close contact with one of the teenagers’ families.

Mr
Kennedy said: 'We are devastated - I spoke to my dad and he says that 
in 40 years of being in Leicester nothing like this has happened.

'Our biggest concern is obviously with the lads and their families and we wish them the best recovery.

'We are not sure at the moment what happened.

'We have nothing to hide. We put our kids on our rides and ride them ourselves, so we are still in shock.'

He said Billy Bates had subcontracted the ride from another company and Abbey Park fair was the first time it had been used.

He said all the rides were checked regularly.

Danny's brother, Andrew, 19, said yesterday that his parents were at the hospital as their son underwent surgery.

He added: 'The main thing is my mum and dad are making sure Danny is okay, they are at the hospital at the moment. He had to have an operation.'

A spokeswoman for Leicester Royal Infirmary said both boys were now stable.

She said: 'The parents of the children would like to pass on the message to all well-wishers that both boys are now stable.'

A police spokeswoman said: 'The fairground was closed for the night and the area cordoned off while the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) investigated.'

The HSE said it was investigating and could not comment further. The ride was dismantled by staff on Sunday.

The fair opened on July 22, and was due to stay until August 28. It has been closed since the accident but may reopen today.
