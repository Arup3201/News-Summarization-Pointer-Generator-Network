This Michigan home may look like a normal house from the outside - but hidden behind its walls is an organ more complex than many found inside churches around the world.

And while the one-bedroom property is on the market for $129,000, the rare instrument would take music-lovers five years to assemble to the tune of $1 million dollars, experts say.

The 85-year-old organ was bought in 2002 from a Muskegon church by homeowner Bill Tufts, who died this year at 72. He was long obsessed with organs - even though he never knew how to play.

The instrument, which has three sets of keyboards and pedals, is next to the kitchen table and when it is played, a giant blower can be heard in the basement, WZZM reported.

Music to your ears: This modest Grand Rapids, Michigan house is home to an organ with around 2,300 pipes

Complex: The home is on the market for $129,000 - even though the organ costs around $1 million

Hidden: A room at the back of the house is filled with pipes, with the tallest standing at 17 feet

But while the keys are the only part of the instrument on show, the organ's extensive web of pipes take up a third of the entire house.

Pipes of all sizes are hidden in a room at the back of the house. The longest pipe is 17 feet and, in total, there are around 2,300 pipes - each providing a different music note.

Tufts, who adored organ music but worked as a car mechanic, had wanted a pipe in his home ever since he was a boy - but he could only ever look at it.

'He couldn't play it, but he wanted an organ in his house so he had it put in,' realtor Mark Douglas told WZZM.

Web: A giant blower is in the basement, while pipes fill up so many other rooms that there is just one bedroom and one-and-a-half bathrooms inside the house. The organ took the previous owner years to build

Work of art: Each of the pipes provides a different note - and the house is well insulated to prevent noise

Extravagant: It would cost $100,000 to re-install the pipes elsewhere - and $1 million to completely replicate 

Grand: The organ's previous owner, who passed away this year aged 72, could not even play the instrument

He found the organ, which dates from the 1990s, in need of serious repair in Muskegon and installed it with the help of friends and Haan Pipe Organ, the Huffington Post reported.

Tufts, who had no surviving family members, bequeathed the home to Don Haan, the owner of Haan Pipe Organ, and his partner, Guy Vander Wagen.

Because of the Kimball organ, the house has just one upstairs bedroom and one-and-a-half baths, but the garage where Tufts worked as a handyman is heated and air-conditioned.

Haan said re-installation would cost about $100,000, and he estimated that duplicating the entire 'irreplaceable treasure' would likely cost close to $1 million.

Despite its size, insulation inside the house means the neighbors won't complain about the noise.

Unassuming: From the outside it is impossible to tell that the rare instrument fills up rooms inside

Much-needed space: As well as the house, the property has a garage that is heated and air-conditioned

It's 'probably not any more [noise] than your average church would leak sound,' Douglas said.

He said he's received calls from across the country, and some potential buyers want to salvage the organ and re-sell the home.

Haan said they hope to find a buyer who possesses the same passion and dedication to the merger of the home and instrument as his late friend. 

'We really would like somebody to buy it who likes the organ and appreciates it for what it is,' he said.
