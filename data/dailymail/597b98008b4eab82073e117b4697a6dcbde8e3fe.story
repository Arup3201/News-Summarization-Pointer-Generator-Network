This is the slave held captive by ‘evil monsters’ in a ‘dark dungeon’ of a council house for more than three decades.

Rosie, 30, penned hundreds of desperate letters and poems from captivity, describing how she suffered ‘unspeakable torment’ at the hands of a couple who adopted her when she was a baby after her parents died in a fire.

In a series of anguished letters, the terrified woman said: ‘I’m like a fly trapped in a spider’s web.’

Rosie, 30, penned hundreds of desperate letters and poems from captivity to her neighbour, describing how she suffered ‘unspeakable torment’ at the hands of a couple who adopted her when she was a baby

The youngest of the three British 'slaves' is seen in one of several pictures sent to a neighbour who she was said to be obsessed with

Rosie was allegedly held prisoner 
almost her entire life along with a 57-year-old Irish woman and a 
69-year-old Malaysian woman until they were rescued from a flat in 
Brixton, South London, last month,

The
 couple accused of keeping the women prisoner – an Indian man and his 
Tanzanian wife, both 67 – were said last night to be leaders of a 
radical Marxist group based in Brixton which collapsed in the 1970s and 
met the older victims through a ‘shared political ideology’.

The
 male suspect was known to police having being arrested in the 1970s, 
prompting questions about whether police missed opportunities to rescue 
the brainwashed women, who were regularly beaten.

Last
 night officers were searching 13 addresses around London, as it was 
revealed that the couple moved frequently to avoid detection.

Letters sent to Marius Feneck from Rosie - one of the three women held captive in Brixton

Rachel Price 25 and her boyfriend Marius Feneck 26. The victim sent letters and 220 poems to Marius, a neighbour she fixated on, telling him how she was locked up by 'evil and racist' monsters

Guard: Police stand in front of a property in Brixton, Borough of Lambeth, south London where three women were allegedly kept as slaves for at least 30 years

Probe: Plain-clothed police officers conduct door-to-door investigations at addresses close to the flat where the women were found

The
 disclosures came as an astonishing series of heart-rending letters and 
photographs of the youngest victim emerged, in which she told of her 
despair at being held prisoner.

Starved
 of love, the victim sent letters and 220 poems to Marius Feneck, a 
neighbour she fixated on, telling him how she was locked up by ‘evil and
 racist’ monsters.

She said: ‘I want you to know the truth.

'These monsters here are absolutely evil and racist.

‘I
 begged them that horrible night not to tear us apart, but they said 
they’d HARM YOU if I don’t promise to stay away from you... and then 
they imprisoned me here, locking all the doors and windows.

‘I
 daren’t try anything because I know they’ll do something evil to you if
 I do... So I’m like a fly trapped in a spider’s web...

‘I
 apologise to you from the bottom of my heart for the evil actions of 
these crooks who dare to call themselves my “relatives”. I HATE them!’

She goes on: ‘I suffer unspeakable torment, yet every bit is worth it, to keep my beloved safe.

‘I
 will surely die if anything happened to you. I would gladly stay in 
this evil monsters’ dark dungeon for the rest of my life – hey I would 
gladly give up my life (I call it life, but it’s not, it’s only 
existence... your ever loyal dragon Rosie.’

She also posted dozens of photographs of herself to him, which reveal the cramped, sparsely furnished flat that was her home.

In one shot, she is seen cradling a Father Christmas cuddly toy in a photograph she referred to ‘Redhead Rosie’ with her ‘baby’.

Possessions: Boxes of crayons and other items sit on a window ledge at the south London

Neighbours said they often saw a young woman who lived at the property staring out of the window or accompanying an elderly couple to the shops

In
 another she is sitting on a plastic chair, resting her aching feet 
after hours of carrying out household chores.

The first thing the youngest of the three women asked for after escaping the south London flat was make-up.

The
 30-year-old was freed into the care of the Freedom Charity along with a
 57-year-old Irish woman and a 69-year-old Malaysian woman.

Freedom
 charity founder Aneeta Prem told the Sunday Times: 'It was the first 
thing that she asked me for and one of the things she was very, very 
keen on.

'She
 liked the way I did my make-up. I don't know if she had ever worn 
make-up. I ended up buying them all foundation, mascara, eye liners, 
powders lipsticks.

'They were absolutely thrilled and excited when I took the box of make-up out.'

She wrote: ‘I have to rest
 my legs a lot, they hurt! My ankles swell up, and my toes start 
cramping up.’

Mr Feneck, 26, a welding student said he received knitted gifts which were sprayed with strong perfume and birthday cards.

‘One
 day I was speaking to Rosie and she told me she had come to Britain 
after her parents died in a fire and the people she was living with had 
adopted her but she didn’t say where she came from originally,’ he said.

‘She
 began sending me photos of herself. They were signed darling love Red 
Head Rosie or Writer Rosie. She said things like she loved me and we 
were meant to be together.’

He
 said the other women were frightened to tell him their names. ‘I spoke 
to them once or twice a year when I was passing,’ he said. ‘They would 
never volunteer names. If you asked they would change the subject.’

Mr
 Feneck’s girlfriend, Rachael Price, 25, said she felt threatened when 
the girl began sending her abusive letters after she moved in with him .

Miss Price said: ‘I 
felt quite disturbed, but I didn’t go to the police because I thought 
she had problems so I would just leave it.’

Last
 night pressure was growing on Lambeth Council after it emerged that 
Rosie had first come to the attention of the social services 15 years 
ago.

Questions: Lambeth Council was under pressure last night to reveal how much it knew about the women who were rescued last month

Police are conducting house-to-house inquiries in the area around the housing association flat in Peckford Place, Brixton, south London

Peckford Place: A 30-year-old British woman, a 57-year-old Irish woman and a 69-year-old Malaysian woman were rescued from a house in Lambeth, south London, last month

A senior Lambeth 
councillor, who did not wish to be named, said her adoptive parents were
 reported to the police because Rosie, who was then 15, was not going to
 school.

The councillor 
said: ‘The police passed the complaint to social services but they said 
they weren’t prepared to take any action.’

Another
 senior councillor said  Lambeth’s social services, education and 
housing departments had all had contact with the household. Last night 
Lambeth Council refused to comment.

A
 man and woman, both 67, were arrested last Thursday but released on 
bail after being questioned over false imprisonment and immigration 
offences.

Last night Theresa May, the Home  Secretary, said tackling modern slavery in Britain was a ‘personal priority’.

She
 said: ‘It is all around us, hidden in plain sight. Something most of us
 thought consigned to history books, belonging to a different century, 
is a shameful and shocking presence in modern Britain.’
