If this tempting taste of autumn whets your appetite, just wait till next month.

The great British countryside is preparing a breathtaking display which could make autumn one of the most glorious in living memory.

Experts are predicting a riot of leaf colours, wild fruits and nuts thanks to a fortuitous combination of weather conditions which have primed Mother Nature to put on a show like no other.

A colourful taste of things to come: The Tu Hwnt I'r Bont Tearoom in North Wales this week

Colourful: Experts are predicting a 'riot' of colour this autumn after a wet spring and warm summer has provided the perfect conditions

Unless a sudden spell of heavy and 
prolonged rainfall intervenes, come mid-October we can expect flame red 
maple leaves lighting up the landscape, trees weighed down with bright 
berries and hedgerows heavy with fruit perfect for jam-making.

The
Tu Hwnt I’r Bont (Beyond the Bridge) Tearoom, pictured right, at 
Llanrwst in North Wales couldn’t wait till then to show off its autumn 
coat, but the best seems yet to come.

Matthew Oates, a National Trust 
naturalist, said: ‘Yes, it could be great. Autumn in this country is 
usually very good, if not utterly brilliant, but this year you are 
dealing with a battle of the superlatives.

'It is very difficult to 
predict, but it could be an unusually good year.’

A
summer with plenty of warmth and sunshine was perfect for letting 
sugars build up in leaves, boosting the colour change in autumn. 
Previous heavy rainfall has also helped.

Simon
Toomer, of the Forestry Commission, said: ‘Because it was such a wet 
summer last year, trees began this summer with plenty of water and have 
not dried out too much despite the summer heat.

‘This recipe of plenty of sunshine and rain in equal measure means we can expect a magnificent array of colour.’

Fun in the sun: The warm weather is expected to continue for most of the country over the weekend, according to the Met Office

The Forestry Commission believes the colours will reach their peak in the third week of October to the first week of November.

‘There’s
only a very short window to see these beautiful changes occurring so 
we’re encouraging people to get out and see what the forests and trees 
have on offer this autumn,’ said Mr Toomer, the Commission’s director at
the National Arboretum at Westonbirt, Gloucestershire.

Apples are already producing a bumper crop, and the lack of rainfall means the blackberries should be firmer and tastier too.

Other
wild fruits to look out for include the rowan or mountain ash, which 
produces bright scarlet berries, while the hawthorn and rose hip should 
be equally stunning.

Early morning mist: While the weather today had been sunny in most areas, with temperatures reaching 20C in places including north Wales, the nights are still expected to be quite 'chilly'

Forecast: Temperatures tomorrow could reach 20C in the south while they are expected to be in the late teens in the north

Steam gala: The USA Class S160 locomotive 6046 makes its way through Darnholm on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway at the start of the Autumn Steam Gala which runs until Sunday

█ A study of 2,000 homeowners has found that the average British gardener spent 154 hours - or 19 full working days - toiling away in the garden this summer.

The weather inspired proud homeowners to tend lawns and flowerbeds and the average adult had 32 days between mid-May and late August when they could get out and relax in their garden.
