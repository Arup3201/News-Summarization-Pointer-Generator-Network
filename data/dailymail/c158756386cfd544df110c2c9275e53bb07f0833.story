Captured: Delta Force commandoes pulled al-Qaeda terrorist Abu Anas al-Libi off the streets of Tripoli after a 15-year manhunt

America's two most elite commando teams have carried a pair of dramatic raids against terrorist targets in two African nations, killing members of the Somali group al-Shabab and capturing a mastermind of the 1998 embassy bombing in Nairobi, Kenya, who has avoided justice for 15 years.

Before dawn on Saturday, Navy SEAL Team Six - the same unit that killed Osama bin Ladin - swam ashore outside the villa of an al-Shabab leader in Baraawe, Somalia, a coastal stronghold for the al-Qaeda-backed terrorist group.

It is believed the raid was carried out in response to al-Shabab's Westgate mall massacre in Nairobi, Kenya, which left more than 60 civilians dead two weeks ago.

In shades of Black Hawk Down, a disastrous U.S. military operation in Somalia's capital 20 years ago, the SEALs encountered significantly heavier resistance than they anticipated and were driven back after a fierce 15 to 20-minute firefight - before they could complete their objective. At least one al-Shabab militant was killed.

Hours after the operation in Somalia, Delta Force - the Army's most elite Special Forces unit - pulled al-Qaeda terrorist Abu Anas al-Libi off the streets of Tripoli, Libya, as he was arriving for morning prayers.

Al-Libi had a $5million price on his head after he was indicted by federal prosecutors in 2000. He is believed to have suggested bombing the Nairobi embassy and performed surveillance in advance of the attack.

The twin bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and injured more than 4,0000 in August 1998. Al-Qaeda, under the leadership of Osama bin Laden, carried out the attacks in response to the American peacekeeping mission in Mogadishu, Somalia.

No U.S. troops were inured in either raid.

American officials said they told the Libyan government about the raid in Tripoli, but Prime Minister Ali Zeidan has said he was never informed about the operation. 

He called the capture of al-Libi a 'kidnapping' and said he should have been tried in Libya.

The pair of daring operations in Africa, carried out by the best-equipped and most heavily trained commandos in the United States, come a week and a half after al-Shabab terrorists slaughtered 67 people during a massacre at the upscale Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi.

They were also staged as President Barack Obama's credibility in the world has taken a dramatic hit. A deadlock in Congress has shut down the federal government. He was also forced to reverse course his position of launching missile attacks on Syria after the British withdrew their support and Russia proposed destroying the country's chemical weapons stockpiles.

Secretary of State John Kerry, attending a conference in Bali, Indonesia, trumpeted the raids, saying 'members of al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations literally can run but they can’t hide.'

It has been reported that the Somali compound that was attacked once was home to  Sheikh Ahmed Abdi Godane, a top leader of al-Shabab

He added: 'We hope that this makes 
clear that the United States of America will never stop in it’s effort 
to hold those accountable who conduct acts of terror.'

The town of Baraawe, about 110 miles south of Mogadishu, was the last known 
home of Ahmed Abdi Godane. He is the leader of al-Shabaab, the terror 
group that claimed responsibility for the attack on a mall in Nairobi 
that killed more than 60 civilians between September 21 and 24.

An
 unnamed Somali government official said a Chechen member of the terror 
group was the target and he was injured and his guard killed in the 
attack.

According to The Guardian, a Somalian radio station named the rebel as Abu Diyad, also known as Abu Ciyad.

Baraawe police have estimated the number of dead to be seven.

SEAL
 Team Six attacked a beachfront house, where high-level members of al 
Shabaab were known to stay, exactly two weeks after the Westgate Mall 
Attack. They approached before dawn, using silencers to drown out their 
weapons, but the operation soon turned into an open firefight as the 
Somali combatants engaged them, according to reports.

As many as 12 al-Shabaab fighters were staying there at the time of the assault before heading to a mission abroad. The battle lasted no longer than 20 minutes, according to a US official. There were no American casualties.

After
 the fight, an al-Shabaab spokesman said it was British and Turkish 
forces who raided the home, but both countries quickly denied their 
involvement. US officials have since confirmed Navy SEALS took part in the daring assault.

Responsible: Somalian-based terrorist organization al Shabab took credit for the attack while it was going on

A spokesperson for the terrorist organization initially reported one member of their group was killed

'Westerners in boats attacked our base at Baraawe beach and one was martyred from our side,” an al-Shabaab spokesman told Reuters.

'No planes or helicopters took part in the fight. The attackers left weapons, medicine and stains of blood, we chased them.'

Al-Shabaab militants tightened their grip on the seaside town soon after the Navy SEALs disappeared from their two-story compound, searching home to home for evidence a spy turned evidence over to Americans, according to witnesses.

'We woke up to find al-Shabab fighters had sealed off the area and their hospital is also inaccessible,' said one witness, adding that 'the town is in a tense mood.'

'We were awoken by heavy gunfire last night, we thought an al Shabaab base at the beach was captured,' another local Sumira Nur said, adding that she heard shells but was not sure where they landed.

This was the first publicly-announced raid by U.S. special ops in Somalia since the rescue of two charity workers from the country in January 2012, after they had been kidnapped by Somali pirates and held hostage for three months.

Hours later the Tripoli raid was aimed at a specific Al-Qaeda target.

Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, known more commonly as Anas al-Libi, was taken from his car by U.S. Army Delta Force commandos while parking after morning prayers, the Pentagon has confirmed.

His sister-in-law described the attack as she saw it from her bedroom window. Three cars closed in on him, foreign-looking commandos smashed the car's window and took hold of his gun before racing away from the scene with the wanted man, she said.

The terrorist 'is currently lawfully detained by the U.S. military in a secure location outside of Libya,' a Pentagon official said.

Anas al-Libi is said by US officials to be a senior member of al-Qaeda. The Federal Bureau of Investigation had a standing $5million bounty for information leading to his capture.
