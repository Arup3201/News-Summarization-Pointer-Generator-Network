Actor Matt Damon has lent his support to a new campaign to help the 750 million people in the world who still do not have access to clean water.

In a video for Stella Artois and Water.org, the Bourne Identity actor, 44, reveals the shocking statistic that women around the world are walking a total of 200 MILLION hours a day just to collect fresh water.

The crisis disproportionately affects women as they are often the ones who are called upon to provide supplies for their families.

Matt states in the video: 'What if we could give them that time back and stop those journeys so they can start news ones of their own?'

Images of Matt walking alongside a reservoir contrast to the poignant ones of women in India walking for miles to reach a source of fresh water.

The women are heard saying: 'Everybody needs water. People can not live without clean water. It is very difficult for us to get water, very difficult.' 

In order to help them, Matt, Stella Artois and Water.org have joined forces to urge people to 'Buy a Lady a Drink'. 

And although it may sound like an odd union - a beer company known for it's laddish audience, coming together with a world renowned charity, both Stella and Water.org hope with their partnership they can make a change. 

They have designed four special drinks chalices - the purchase of which will provide water to one person for five years.

Talking about his work with Water.org co-founder Gary White, Matt said: 'Over the years, we have travelled together to several developing countries, meeting thousands of women and young girls who shared their dreams of becoming a doctor, nurse, lawyer or teacher.

'Many of our conversations took place while tracing the long and often difficult path these women and young girls walked every day to secure water for their families. 

'We were deeply moved by their aspirations, but it was difficult to ignore the reality that the number of hours they spend on their journeys to secure water would effectively destroy their dreams.' 

He added: 'One of the Stella Artois films tells the story of Anita. Anita had a water tap installed in her home a year ago. 

'Having water available at the start of every day has allowed Anita to work at the family business and plant crops, avoiding the long journey to the centre of Nagpur to shop at market for vegetables.

'Her children no longer miss school because of the need to line up at a local water source waiting for water that never comes.'

As well as launching the campaign Stella have also donated $1.2million to Water.org. 

The three chalices were inspired by traditional handcrafted objects from three of the developing countries where Water.org operates, including textiles from India, baskets from Ethiopia and pottery from Honduras.
