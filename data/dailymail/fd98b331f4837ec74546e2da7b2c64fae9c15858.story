Aston Villa have made a £3.9million offer for Valencia midfielder Carles Gil. 

The 22-year-old has been on loan at Elche, who are also keen to take him, but Villa will offer a bigger financial package. 

The one sticking point is Valencia would prefer to loan him again rather than sell, as they believe he has good potential.

Gil is small but quick and can play behind the striker or as a right-sided midfielder and would be re-united with Carlos Sanchez if he joined Villa. Everton showed an interest in him last season.

Villa are also monitoring Lens defender Dimitri Cavare, 19. The right back has been earmarked as Swansea and Bolton have shown interest in signing Villa’s Matthew Lowton. 

Villa midfielder Gary Gardner has joined Nottingham Forest on loan until the end of the season.
