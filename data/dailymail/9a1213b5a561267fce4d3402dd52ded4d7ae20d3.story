He doesn’t juggle or ride a unicycle - and it's unlikely you'll ever see him at a children's birthday party.

Instead, this creepy clown spends his free time lurking in empty car parks and dark subways - before hammering strangers to near death with his trusty iron weapon.

But luckily, the violent clown is merely a circus act - who has been created as part of an elaborate prank to trick random members of the public.

Now the video starring the clown, created by two pranksters 
from Magione, Italy, has become an online sensation.

Matteo, one of the men behind the video, said the clown prank film - which took ten days to make - was incredibly unique.

He said: 'I think we are doing some content never ever seen on the web, especially our social experiments and also our extreme pranks.

'Our
 social experiments are a pure eye opener for the people. On the other 
side we really like to do hardcore pranks like the clown one because is 
something unique.'

Matteo and Diego, from DM Pranks 
Productions, have made film pranks since they were at college but only 
started uploading their videos onto YouTube last July.

The three-minute video - which has now been watched by nearly £3m on YouTube - shows the scary-looking clown shocking different strangers with his violent ways.

The film, made by Matteo and Diego from DM Pranks Productions, was made as a prank video to fool strangers into thinking they had witnessed a serious attack. It has now been watched by nearly £3m people on YouTube

In the first prank, the video shows the clown waiting covertly in an almost-empty car park until two unsuspecting men walk past

The clown is heard laughing hysterically as the fake person is left lying in a pool of blood in the car park

In the first prank, the clown - who is dressed head-to-toe in usual circus attire -  is shown hiding behind a corner in a near-empty car park, with a lifeless body at his feet.

As soon as
 two men walk past, the clown smashes down his iron hammer onto the 
man's head, watching as a pool of blood splatters out onto the concrete below.

The clown is then seen laughing hysterically as the two frightened men run off screaming into the distance.

That scene is just the first of four other pranks, in which unsuspecting strangers are fooled into thinking they have witnessed a nasty clown killing or seriously injuring another person.

In another prank on the video, the clown is seen approaching a lone man who is sitting on a plastic chair in a dimly-lit subway

The clown then smashes the person's head with his iron hammer, causing the man to fall off his chair and bash his head on the concrete

The video then shows the clown chasing after the witness, who runs out of the subway looking terrified

Matteo said the clown video was the most difficult film he has ever made - not least because 
the first hammer he so carefully crafted weighed a staggering 58kg and was impossible to use.

He told MailOnline: 'The clown prank has been the most difficult and risky prank we ever did.

'The whole process of elaborating the idea, finding spots, gathering costumes and crafting a properly hammer took something like ten days.

An unsuspecting driver is the next victim in the video, as the clown walks up to the car and starts dousing petrol onto the station forecourt

The man is seen asking the clown what is he doing and who he is - but the sneaky clown remains silent

'Then the filming process has been something really long. We waited for hours and hours to find the good victims.'

But the channel has taken off in a way the filmmakers did not think was possible - even being listed as the most subscribed YouTube channel of the past 24 hours, with 126,000 new subscribers.

The filmmakers usually work as a two-man band, but occasionally draft in 
help from Matteo's cousins for the most 'dangerous and risky scenes'.

For this video, the pair avoided children, people with animals and anyone who could have been aged over 40.

The clown then chases the two men away from the scene as the prank continues

He said: 'For the clown video we decided also to avoid girls because we were worried about the fake blood. Maybe some girls could get shocked while a male might have a stronger mind.'

But even though the pair's popular film has been watched by millions across the world, they still have to be careful about getting into trouble with their elaborate mind games.

He said: 'This is the reason why we are at least four people while recording a dangerous scene.

'Also we don't reveal straight away that is a prank because people will get mad in less than a second.

'Once they get calm and smile we reveal the prank. It's a psychological trick that works extremely well in the end and everyone goes away smiling.'
