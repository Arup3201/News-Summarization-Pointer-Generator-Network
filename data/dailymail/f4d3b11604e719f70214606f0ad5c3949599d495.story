Iranian authorities previously executed Delara Darabi, 17, in 2009 after she was convicted of murder despite strong international protests

A former child bride who was forced to marry at 14 and became a mother the following year is facing execution in Iran for murdering her husband.

Razieh Ebrahimi was 17 when she shot her husband in the head while he was sleeping and burying his body in the back garden.

The mother-of-one, 21,  is 'at imminent risk of execution' according to Human Rights Watch.

Ebrahami is in prison in the south western Iranian city of Ahvaz after she pleaded guilty to her husband's murder, although she claimed he had subjected her to years of physical and verbal abuse.

She has spent the past four years on death row.

Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director of Human Rights Watch, condemned the planned execution.

'Every time an Iranian judge issues a death sentence for a child offender like Ebrahimi, he should remember he is flagrantly violating his legal responsibilities to administer justice fairly and equitably.

'Iran’s judiciary should reverse its execution order of a child bride who says she was battered.'

An Iranian judge passed the death penalty despite Ebrahimi being aged 17 at the time of the murder.

According to Human Rights Watch, Iranian courts can pass a death penalty when a boy is older than 15 or a girl has reached the age of nine if the court accepts evidence from a forensic doctor if they understood the consequences of their action. 

Under Iranian law, the victim's family is able to pardon the killer if they accept compensation, however, the husband's family want the execution to continue.

Since 2009, Human Rights Watch believes that Iran has executed at least 10 child offenders.

Mr Stork added: 'Iran’s judiciary should prove its commitment to protecting children – the most vulnerable members of its population – by calling a halt to death sentences for child offenders.'

According to a report on Iranian news agency Mehr, Ebrahimi told investigators: 'I married our neighbour's son when I was only 14 because my dad insisted. 

'My dad insisted I should marry him because he was educated and was working as a teacher. I was 15 when I gave birth to my child.

'I didn't know who I am or what is life all about. My husband mistreated me. He used any excuse to insult me, even attacking me physically.'

On April 15, the mother of murder victim Abdolah Hosseinzadeh dramatically pardoned her son's killer moments before he was due to be executed.
