German superfans have spent two years building a gigantic replica of Darth Vader's Tie Advanced fighter.

The dedicated team constructed a model that weighs 1.4 tonnes and  measures 16-foot-long by 14-foot-tall.

The group, called Project X1, used
model kits as a starting point to replicate the craft that Darth Vader used to attempt to defend the first Death Star.

Dedication: German superfans have spent two years building a life-size replica of Darth Vader's prototype Tie Advanced fighter

Labour of love: The dedicated team constructed a model that weighs 1.4 tonnes and measures 16-foot-long by 14-foot-tall

Method: The group, called Project X1, used model kits as a starting point to replicate the piece of craft that Darth Vader used to attempt to defend the first Death Star

The massive structure was unveiled today at the Star Wars Celebration Europe convention in Messe Essen, Germany

CNET reported the group's sponsors spent nearly $18,600 (£12,074) on the project that took about 11,000 hours.

Built on a 2:1 scale, the hybrid steel and aluminum frame alone cost nearly $8,000 (£5,100).

The plastic cockpit ball ran a little over $2,500 (£1,600).

Budget: The group's sponsors spent nearly $18,600 (£12,074) on the project

Cause: The men spent hours in their workshop creating the piece of film art

Planning: The group realised their ambition by working their way up from smaller models

Last year a more rudimentary and plywood one-third size Tie Fighter was advertised on CraigsList for $150 (£95).

It was eight-feet wide and eight-feet
high and even came with laser cannons – although they could only fire 
‘standard party poppers’.

Other features include wheeled casters for maneuverability and a cockpit easily capable of holding one small stormtrooper.
