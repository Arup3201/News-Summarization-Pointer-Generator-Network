A little boy laughs as a smiling adult helps him aim a semi-automatic pistol at a target, his first steps to becoming a terrorist hell-bent on war with the West.

This horrific scene is played out in a propaganda video posted online by Al-Qaeda terrorists in strife-hit Afghanistan.

The chilling footage, posted on Youtube, also shows a woman wearing a burkha aiming a rocket-propelled grenade and an exploding car.

Al-Qaeda trains children to become the next generation of terrorists from the age of just five - and sometimes even younger, it now appears.

The video echoes terrifying footage taken from an Al Qaeda terror camp in north Waziristan, near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.

Sitting in long lines as if on a school outing, youngsters struggle to lift deadly AK-47s as they are made to fire off a flurry of rounds, their tiny bodies getting knocked back by the recoil.

Others grapple with pistols as they are brainwashed into waging Jihad on the West and becoming suicide bombers.

Many of the children are orphans of the terrorist organisation's 'martyrs' following the same deadly route as their fathers.

There are fears the terrorists will use women and children in attacks as they are seen as less of a threat by security personnel.
