The mother of Jade Lomas-Anderson, who was mauled to death by a pack of dogs, has described saying goodbye to her daughter as she lay in the mortuary.

Shirley Lomas-Anderson, 36, said she sat with Jade for hours before kissing her for the final time.

She said her daughter's body had been covered with white sheets to spare her family seeing the horrifying injuries.

Only her face and hands, which were covered in scratches, were visible.

Mrs Lomas-Anderson told The Sun: 'I said, "I love you, I'll miss you, I just want you back home"'.

Jade, 14, was alone at a friend's house in Chaucer Grove, Atherton, near Wigan, on March 26 when she was attacked by four dogs - two bull mastiffs and two Staffordshire bull terriers.

Neighbours said she was attacked when she walked into the room holding a meat pie.

One of the dogs went for the food but as Jade tried to fight it off she was dragged to the floor and killed by the four dogs.

Police marksmen shot the animals when they arrived at the house.

Last week Greater Manchester Police said they could not prove a crime had been committed and so were unlikely to make a prosecution, although a spokesman said one may be brought in the future.

The dogs involved in the attack, which happened on private property, were not illegal breeds.

Jade's family have now launched an online petition calling for a change in the law.

The Justice for Jade petition said the family want the law to 'make dog owners accountable for their dogs'.

It calls for licences to be introduced and have dogs registered and micro-chipped to 'save other families suffering like we have gone through.'

The petition will trigger a Commons debate if it reaches 100,000 signatures.

Mrs Lomas-Anderson and her husband Mike, 33, who brought up Jade since she was a small child, said the teenager was allowed to go to friend Kimberley's house for a sleepover after receiving all As and Bs in her report.

Jade, who had ADHD, was in constant contact with her mother throughout the night and went back home to collect some medicine the following day.

She then went back to her friend's house in Atherton, Greater Manchester, when she attacked by Beverley Concannon's dogs.

The couple were called by neighbours and they immediately drove to Concannon's house where police had already put up a cordon.

Mrs Lomas-Anderson said she was convinced it would not be her daughter that was hurt.

She told The Sun: 'I was screaming, "I want to see my baby, I want to see my baby" but I couldn't get through the police, I couldn't get to her'.

Beverley Concannon's house, where Jade was attacked, has now been boarded up

Jade's parents were then escorted home where they were told the devastating news.  

The couple have called said Concannon is a 'heartless monster' for not apologising for their daughter's death.

Her house has now been boarded up while police continued 
to carry out investigations.

Concannon is thought to have been in hiding ever since the attack and her house has been sealed off by the council following requests by the police.

Mr Lomas-Anderson said he hoped the petition will lead to a change in the law to protect other families.

He told The Sun: 'I would never have let Jade stay if I knew those dogs were there and I feel so guilty about that - it's eating me up inside.'

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said last week: 'At this stage of the inquiry, we do not have anything evidentially to categorically prove a crime has been committed, therefore it is unlikely at this stage we will be seeking to bring a prosecution.

'That is not to say that no prosecution will ever be brought, and we still have a number of inquiries to make.

'While we do not want to be drawn on the politics surrounding the legislation of dangerous dogs, we are nonetheless bound by the law.

'As always, our thoughts are with Jade's family, and we continue to offer them support at such a difficult time in their lives.'
