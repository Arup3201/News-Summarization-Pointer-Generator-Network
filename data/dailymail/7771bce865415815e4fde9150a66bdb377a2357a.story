Kent State football player Jason Bitsko, who was slated to start at center for the Golden Flashes this season, died Wednesday, apparently in his sleep.

Police believe he passed away from an undetermined medical issue, the school said. 

The school said in a release the 21-year-old Bitsko was found unresponsive in the bedroom of his off-campus apartment shortly before 9 a.m. 

Tragedy: Kent State starting lineman Jason Bitsko was discovered dead Wednesday morning by a roommate after apparently dying in his sleep 

When Bitsko failed to show up at practice, calls were placed to Bitsko's roommate, who called 911 after finding Bitsko in his bed. 

Brimfield Police arrived on the scene within three minutes of the call.

Bitsko was in his fourth year with the Golden Flashes. He started all 12 games in 2013, and received an award during this year's spring game for 'exemplifying hard work and dedication.'

'Kent State University and the entire Kent community mourns his passing,' said Joel Nielsen, the school's athletic director. 'We are heartbroken by the news of Jason's death. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family, friends, teammates and everyone whose lives he touched.'

Bitsko played at Huber Heights High School, the alma mater of Ohio State quarterback Braxton Miller. 

Bitsko's teammates were informed of Bitsko's death at the end of the morning practice.

'Our players, coaches and everyone involved with our team are hurting because he was family,' coach Paul Haynes said. 'As a team, we will come together and get through this one day at a time.'

Cut down in his prime: Bitsko was in his fourth year with the Golden Flashes. He started all 12 games in 2013, and received an award during this year's spring game for 'exemplifying hard work and dedication'

Staying positive: his final tweet, Bitsko struck an uplifting tone that was echoed in many of his social media posts. That sort of sentiment was reflected in kind as his friends, fans and loved ones posted their tributes and condolences

The school said it is providing counseling services and support to student-athletes and athletic staff members to cope with the tragedy.

Officials asked that those who wished to show support for Kent State and for those who knew Bitsko to use the hashtag #KSUJason54.

The words of support quickly flowed in.

'My condolences go out to the family of Jason Bitsko & the @KentStFootball family on your tragic loss today. #KSUJason54,' tweeted New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman.

Jeff Quinn, head coach of the University of Buffalo, also chimed in and had his team offer a moment of silence for Bitsko:

'UB Bulls moment of silence in respect for Kent State's Jason Bitsko. Our sympathy goes out to all. #KSUJason54,' he wrote, with a picture of his team kneeling in silence.

Bitsko's own last tweet was even more hopeful and uplifting and will no doubt continue to resonate on social media along with the showings of support for his loved ones.

'There are 86,400 seconds in a day. Make sure you use one of those to thank god for everything you have #stayfocused,' he wrote August 14. 

Big name sympathy: Julian Edelman, wide receiver for the New England Patriots, was one of many Twitter users who showed their support through the social media site

Moment of silence: Head coach of the University of Buffalo football team also tweeted support and his team had a moment of silence at practice Wednesday
