Jigsaw enthusiasts  each have their own method of tackling a tricky puzzle - some start with the edges while others work sections of the image at a time.

But the latest design will test even the most methodical puzzler.

Each of the 1,000 pieces in the '1000 Colours' puzzle is a completely different colour to the next and they have to be placed according to the CMYK system.

'1000 Colours'  (show) was designed by illustrator Clemens Habicht. Each of its 1,000 pieces are a different colour on the CMYK system. CMYK refers to cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black) inks used in printing

CMYK refers to the four inks typically used in colour printing - cyan, magenta, yellow, and key or black. 

The puzzle was designed by Paris-based graphic artist Clemens Habicht. 

Mr Habicht said: 'The idea came from enjoying the subtle differences in the blue of a sky in a particularly brutal jigsaw puzzle.

'I found that without the presence of image detail to help locate a piece, I was relying only on an intuitive sense of colour.

Despite being touted as the world's most difficult puzzle, Mr Habicht said it is easier than it first appear. 'Unlike ordinary puzzles where you are in effect redrawing a specific picture from a reference, you have a sense of where every piece belongs compared to every other piece,' Mr Habicht said

'And this was much more satisfying to do than the areas with image details.'

'What is strange is that unlike ordinary puzzles where you are in effect redrawing a specific picture from a reference, you have a sense of where every piece belongs compared to every other piece,' he said.

The completed puzzle measures 19 inches (50cm) by 27 inches (70cm) and it costs $70 AUD (£36). Limited numbers of the jigsaw are available from Australian company Lamington Drive

The current run of 1000 Colour (pieces pictured) is the second edition of the puzzle. It first went on sale last year, and the firm said it is working on producing a third

It had previously been thought the human eye couldn't see infrared light.

However, researchers have revealed that under certain conditions, the retina can sense infrared light after all.

An international team of researchers used cells from the retinas of mice and people.

By firing powerful lasers that emit pulses of infrared light, the researchers found that  light-sensing cells in the retina sometimes get a double hit of infrared energy.

When that happens, the eye is able to detect light that falls outside the visible spectrum. 

'There is a real logic in doing that. It is weirdly soothing and therapeutic.

'As each piece clicks perfectly into place, just so, it's a little win - like a little pat on the back.'

The completed puzzle measures 19 inches (50cm) by 27 inches (70cm).

It costs $70 AUD (£36) and is published by Australian company Lamington Drive.

There are limited numbers of the puzzle available to order from Lamington Drive's website and shipping takes up to 10 days.
