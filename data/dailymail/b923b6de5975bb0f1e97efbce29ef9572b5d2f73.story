As well as international memorabilia, James' items for sale include shirts from his numerous previous clubs including Liverpool, Bristol City and Portsmouth - with the latter's 2007-08 season 110-year anniversary top selling for £333 after 25 bids.

James has built up crippling debts after breaking up with his wife Tanya in 2005 and is said to have blown his £20million fortune which came from his football wages, endorsements and modelling contracts for companies such as Armani. 

1,800 vinyl records were the biggest seller at the auction going for £5,632

The 44-year-old played in the Premier League for teams such as Liverpool, Manchester City and Portsmouth and has recently came out of retirement to become a player-manager at Indian Super League side Kerala Blasters.

The former England keeper has written a regular column for The Observer and has always donated his fee to charity. He also owned a house in Dubai at the time of a credit crisis, which was part of his seven-strong property portfolio. 

James split up with his wife to rekindle a relationship with childhood sweetheart Amanda Salmon, and they have been together for nearly a decade. He was forced to pay Tanya £3m as part of the divorce settlement.

His PR team have refused to comment about the bankruptcy. 

James' pink goalkeeper strip he had previously worn against Chelsea in the 2010 FA Cup final was sold and the yellow England jersey he wore against Algeria at the 2010 World Cup went for £1,155 at auction

A 1998-1999 multi-coloured Port Vale goalkeeper shirt - which he would have swapped with former Manchester United trainee Kevin Pilkington - was also available to buy.

Not just limited to football memorabilia - including a large number of pre-worn shorts and signed balls - DJ equipment including a Technics turntable (which is no longer manufactured), three bicycles, a Diamond Jubilee plastic half-mug piece and a chainsaw were also sold.

Age: 44

Professional club appearances: 947 

Former clubs: Watford, Liverpool, Aston Villa, West Ham, Manchester City, Portsmouth, Bristol City, Bournemouth, IBV (Iceland)

Honours: League Cup (1995), FA Cup (2008) 

James is still listed as part of BT Sport's media team - despite signing up for the 10-week long Indian Super League along with fellow former Premier League stars such as Robert Pires, Freddie Ljungberg and Nicolas Anelka.

James, who made 53 appearances for England between 1997 and 2010, won two major honours during his spell in England - the 1995 League Cup with Liverpool and the 2008 FA Cup with Portsmouth before moving to Iceland to join IBV.

Former team-mate Stan Collymore, who played with James at Liverpool, said the goalkeeper had a tendency to throw away his money as if he'd be earning it for ever.

Collymore said in his 2004 autobiography: 'If he had a new car and he pranged it, he would just go and buy a new car.

'If he bought a new pair of shoes and he scuffed them, he wouldn't clean them. He would just chuck them in the spare room and buy a new pair. 

'Too much disposable income, I suppose. Too easy just to bin stuff. Too easy to spend money like you're going to be earning that kind of money for the rest of your life.' 

One item not included in the auction is the infamous white - or cream, depending on who you ask - suit worn by James and his Liverpool team-mates on the Wembley pitch before the 1996 FA Cup final. 

They came to sum up Liverpool's 'Spice Boys' and James lamented that the suits became more memorable than the match itself, which was won 1-0 by opponents Manchester United.

The Armani suits were the goalkeeper's choice as he was modelling with the firm at the time. 

His former Liverpool team-mate Robbie Fowler told the Independent in 2008: 'It was David James's idea.

'At the time, he was an Armani model. If we had won, nobody would have mentioned it. But we lost and it has become infamous. People remind me about them all the time.'

We can only wonder what the suit might fetch were it included in the auction.
