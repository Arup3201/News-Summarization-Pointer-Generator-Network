A photo circulating online is claiming to show that 15 Olympic Games officials racked up a £44,660 bill for a business lunch - including a staggering £19,000 on one bottle of Hennessy 1853 cognac.

The service charge for the meal - apparently enjoyed at a restaurant in London's exclusive Dorchester Hotel - came to £4962.26 alone.

The partial view of the bill shows relatively modestly-priced dishes - such as portions of spiced chicken for £15 apiece, vegetarian fried rice for £5 and sorbet platters at £7 a time - alongside the costly cognac.

The receipt: This was the image posted on Reddit of a lunch bill allegedly run up by 15 Olympics officials

The extravagant lunch may have been enjoyed at the China Tang restaurant (above) at The Dorchester on London's Park Lane, according to website Gawker. The cocktail menu there does indeed offer a 35cl bottle of Hennessy 1853 cognac for £19,000 (file photo)

The receipt was posted on social media site Reddit by a user who claimed to know a worker at the unnamed restaurant.

It was then reported on American news site The Atlantic Wire with an appeal for more details about the pricey meal.

A further report by US website Gawker suggested that the extravagant lunch had been enjoyed at the China Tang restaurant at The Dorchester on London's Park Lane, where the cocktail menu offers a 35cl bottle of Hennessy 1853 cognac for £19,000.

MailOnline approached China Tang  but the restaurant responded: 'No comment'.

AND MailOnline's calls to LOCOG, the organising committee for London 2012, have gone unreturned.

The man's Reddit account has since been closed, but when posting the picture he wrote mischievously: 'My friend's a waiter and this is a receipt for an official lunch for 15 Olympic Bosses in London.

'Now we see where all the money's going.'

The person who first posted the receipt online claimed to know a worker at the unnamed restaurant, believed to be at the Dorchester Hotel (above)

A bottle of Hennessy 1853 cognac sold for £956 at Christie's auction house in September 2004.

Gawker's Max Read said:
'We called the restaurant to see if it had hosted a 15-person Olympic 
luncheon; the hostess told us that it "probably" had — apparently 
Olympic officials have been in and out of the restaurant over the last 
few weeks — but she couldn't specifically confirm this one.

'So we don't know for sure that it was, as some Reddit commenters suggest, a group of Olympics bureaucrats spending taxpayer money on an obscenely priced bottle of Hennessy (taxpayer money doesn't directly fund the Olympics, but taxpayers are generally left to foot the bill for the large indirect costs).'
