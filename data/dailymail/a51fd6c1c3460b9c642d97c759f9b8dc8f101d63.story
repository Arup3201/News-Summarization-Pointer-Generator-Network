Arrested: Amit Singh has been arrested for the 2009 rape of a 14-year-old girl

A Long Island man who fled to India after being accused of raping a 14-year-old girl was extradited back to the US this weekend.

The victim was walking past his Elmont, NY., house March 11, 2009 on her way to school when Mr Singh approached her and tried talking her to go into his home, according to WABC.

When she refused, he grabbed her right hand, forced her inside and raped her in a bedroom, according to the station.

Mr Singh then drove the girl to school after the horrific act, she told a teacher later what happened later that day. The station reported.

â€˜Mr. Singh subjected this innocent young girl to unspeakable horrors, both physical and emotional, before running to the other side of the world to avoid the consequences, Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice told the station.

The depraved man skipped town five days later, one day before his victim Identified him in a photo lineup, and was free until being detained in 2011 as he tried to board a flight to Thailand, officials told the station.
