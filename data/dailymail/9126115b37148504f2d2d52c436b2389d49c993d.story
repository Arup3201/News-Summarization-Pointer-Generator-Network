Ridesharing app Uber has copped a ferocious backlash after outraged Sydney workers found prices had spiked dramatically in the wake of a terrifying hostage crisis in the city's centre.

The city has gone into lockdown after an armed gunman entered the Lindt cafe in Martin Place, holding more than a dozen people at gunpoint and forcing some sobbing customers and workers to hold a black Islamic flag in the store's window.

But as workers clamoured to leave the city's Central Business District, many Uber users discovered the price of trips from the city's CBD had more than doubled under the company's 'surge pricing' policy - or pricing during periods of high demand.

Ridesharing app: Uber has become a popular alternative to catching a taxi - much to the ire of taxi associations both in Australia and around the world

Initial response: Uber responded to growing outrage about the cost of its services by saying it was to 'encourage more drivers to come online and pick up passengers'

Hostage terror: More than a dozen staff and customers are thought to be held prisoner inside the Lindt chocolate cafe store in the heart of Sydney's CBD

Heavily armed: Police toting heavy assault rifles have taken to the streets of Sydney as office buildings and even the city's iconic Opera House were evacuated

Uber initially justified the price hike in a tweet. 

'We are all concerned with events in CBD,' the company said. 'Fares have increased to encourage more drivers to come online & pick up passengers in the area.' 

But commuters weren't buying it. 'What a shameful disgrace,' tweeted web developer Tyson Armstrong.  

'How low can you go? Marketing fail is one thing, but lack of compassion is another,' wrote Julie Gozali. 

Mashable reported an Uber trip to Sydney Airport under the 'surge pricing' rule topped an extraordinary $145 this morning for one user, with a 'minimum $100 fare' briefly listed. 

Daily Mail Australia witnessed a ride being offered from George St, the city's main artery, to the Airport cost $75 this afternoon. A reasonable taxi fare for such a trip would usually cost $45 and $55 and a typical trip with Uber's famously inexpensive app service would cost even less, according to Sydney Airport.

Half an hour after their initial tweet - following a social media frenzy - Uber backed down.

'Uber Sydney will be providing free rides out of the CBD to help Sydneysiders get home safely,' the company said in a statement.

'Our thoughts are with those affected and the NSW Police Force.

'We are in the process of refunding rides.

'Please note that surge pricing only remains in place to encourage more drivers to come online and pick up passengers from the area.' 

NSW Premier Mike Baird this afternoon urged Sydney residents to commute home in the usual manner. 

'In terms of matters of transport in the city, can I ask everyone to go about in their usual manner - go about your usual exit from the city as you would,' Mr Baird told reporters. 

The hostage crisis has continued for more than five hours with little sign of abating.
