A Georgia teen who splurged on a BMW using $31,000 mistakenly deposited into his account has been sentenced to ten years on probation and has to pay the money back.

The money was intended to be placed into the account of a Vietnam veteran, Steven Fields, 70, who had just sold land - but the 18-year-old, with the same name as the victim, had the money given to him through a bank error.

Surprisingly for the men who met each other for the first time in court, both Mr Fields and the spend thrift reside in the same town of Hull, lived within half a mile of each other for a period of time and bank at First Citizens Bank, according to CBS 46. 

A Georgia teen (18-year-old Steven Fields above) who splurged on a BMW using $31,000 mistakenly deposited into his account has been sentenced to ten years on probation and has to pay the money back

The money was intended to be placed into the account of a Vietnam veteran, Steven Fields, 70, (elder Fields pictured above) who had just sold land - but the 18-year-old, with the same name as the victim, had the money given to him through a bank error

In addition to the flashy purchase of the BMW, his ten-day spending spree also included purchases on clothes and food at various stores and a fast-food restaurant, according to KHQ.

Following his sentencing, he has reportedly been arrested for illegal drug possession.

In the March 2014 bank error, the teenager was charged with felony theft after spending the money.

When he first received the funds, he first withdrew  $20,000 in cash before spending another $5,000.

On March 18, when he returned to the bank take out more cash, he was asked to return the money mistakenly placed into his account, according to Athens Banner-Herald.

While Mr Fields and the recipient of the money had a lot in common, they never knew of each other.

In addition to the flashy purchase of the BMW, his ten-day spending spree also included purchases on clothes and food at various stores and a fast-food restaurant. Following his sentencing, he has reportedly since been arrested for illegal drug possession

Following the incident, the rightful owner of the money has reportedly had it returned to him by the bank.

However, he said more than anything, he is upset the teller, who has not been named and made the transaction, has been forced to retire following her error.

He said: 'That's the only thing that upset me was that my friend lost her job.'

Last March, a woman, Stacey Sorrow, who raised the younger Fields said the teller should have corrected her mistake if she was aware there were people with the same name.

She said of the moment the teen received the money: 'He was excited. I would have been too.'

The teen and his father have both apologized to the veteran, who said he does not know if younger Fields is sincere, or just sorry that he got caught.
