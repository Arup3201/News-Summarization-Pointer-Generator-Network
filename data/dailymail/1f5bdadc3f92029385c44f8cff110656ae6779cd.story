According to KFSN, the student was charged with sexually assaulting an animal and has since been released.

The animal, which campus officials say is one of many used for breeding in the ag program, was treated by veterinarians.

Student Marisa Burkdoll, whose job it is to take care of the animals at the sheep unit, told KFSN she first heard of the incident through social media and could not have been more horrified.

'It's just kind of disgusting and revolting and personally makes me angry, I mean why would you do that?' she told KFSN.

Burkdoll has called for the student to be thrown in jail. Other students, by way of a Twitter account that has appeared in the sheep's name, have called for the student's expulsion.

The parody account, @FresnoStSheep, has quickly become a place for students of the university of around 23,000 students to express shock and crack jokes about the incident.
