Ed Miliband's ‘complacent’ leadership is under assault from senior figures in his own party after a poll suggested the Conservatives have extended a new lead over Labour.

Former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott, normally a fierce loyalist, condemned Mr Miliband for pursuing a ‘core vote strategy of getting 31 per cent of traditional Labour supporters with a few ex-Lib Dem voters’.

And Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said it had been a ‘mistake’ for the Labour leader to forget to make any mention of Britain’s vast budget deficit in his final party conference speech before the election.

Lord Prescott, listening to Ed Miliband's speech last week, has today slammed the party leader's strategy to win the next election 

Labour nerves have been jangled by a slump in the party’s ratings following the party conferences. A poll by YouGov showed the Conservatives moving into the lead for the first time in nearly three years, by just one point. Yesterday, it published another survey suggesting the Conservatives are now up to 36 per cent, with Labour on 34 per cent.

It also showed Mr Cameron has opened up a 42-point lead over Mr Miliband on leadership, up from 31 last week. He is more trusted on almost every issue, with the Labour leader ahead only on the NHS.

The Labour leader may as well have told party activists to 'go back to your constituencies and prepare for Coalition'

Ed Balls insisted the Labour leader's speech was '10 out of 10', but admitted it had been a mistake to not mention the deficit

Lord Prescott shocked Labour HQ by tearing into his party’s approach as ‘far too timid’. Writing in his Sunday Mirror column, the former deputy prime minister mocked Mr Miliband’s ‘six-point’ plan for ten years in Downing Street. ‘Can you remember what they were? They were just one-line objectives, not detailed policies,’ he said.

Attacking the strategy of trying to limp to an election win by appealing to core Labour voters plus some disaffected Lib Dems, he added: ‘He might as well have said at the end of his conference speech: “Go back to your constituencies and prepare for coalition”.’

Mr Balls revealed that the Labour leader had told him after his disastrous conference speech that he had blundered. Mr Miliband has been ridiculed after forgetting to deliver planned remarks about the need to rein in the deficit in his address.

‘He said to me afterwards it was a mistake and it was,’ the Shadow Chancellor told Sky News’s Murnaghan programme. ‘But look, that kind of thing happens sometimes in politics.’

Labour MP John Mann said there was an ‘extraordinary level of complacency that permeates the top of the party’.

‘Ed should get out and mix with real voters to discover what they really care about,’ he added. Mr Mann claimed that many backbenchers were infuriated by the ‘35 per cent strategy’ – winning the core Labour vote plus 4 or 5 per cent of former Lib Dems.

‘They seem to think we need just one more small push and we will limp over the line to victory,’ he added.

Labour officials insist that polls suggest the party still has a strong lead in key marginal seats, and Mr Miliband’s conference speech has helped push the NHS up the political agenda.
