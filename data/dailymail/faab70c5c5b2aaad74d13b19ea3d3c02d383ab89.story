The family of Autumn Pasquale confirmed this morning the body discovered inÂ  a recycling unit in Clayton is that of the missing 12-year-old.

The search ended around 10pm on Monday on East Clayton Avenue, New Jersey, when a search team member found her body in one of the blue recycling bins placed out for pickup on Tuesday morning.

The location is right around the corner from the Clayton Police Department, a quarter-mile from Delsea Drive and not far from Autumn's home.

Paul Spadafora, the girl's uncle, thanked the community on Tuesday morning for helping in the search.

Gloucester County, N.J: Map shows where Autumn was last seen leaving her home on Saturday and where her bod was found just a few blocks away last night

He said: 'We have lost a precious, precious child. It's not the results we wanted, but we have closure.'

No arrests have been announced so far and authorities said they don't have any suspects.

Gloucester County Prosecutor Sean Dalton said investigators have no suspects in connection with her death, which is being ruled a homicide.

He said at a press conference: 'At this point, we don't have any person of interest. There have been no arrests,' and pointed out this was a very rare case for the area which is considered safe.

Autumn
was reported missing from her home on Saturday evening, 
and had been the subject of a large search over the last two days until her body was found last night.

An
autopsy to further confirm the body's identity will be conducted this 
morning by the Gloucester County Medical Examiner's office.

Dalton said: 'This is a very sad 
day for the Pasquale family. Our hearts go out to the family and to all 
the residents of Clayton who stood together in support of this young 
girl.'

About 200 law enforcement officials and hundreds more volunteers searched for Autumn yesterday.

Dalton yesterday said that 75 people had been interviewed in connection with what-was-then a missing person case.

Just before 4pm yesterday, investigators entered a house behind a Franklin Township bar after a K-9 dog supposedly picked up a scent.

The owner told the Daily News he got a call from police at work in Mount Laurel and was asked to come home. 'They said they wanted to search my house,' the man said.

Though they left 20 minutes later with nothing, the man said he had nothing to hide but understood why he might be considered suspicious as his back window was recently broken and he is friends with a lot of young girls on Facebook because of his teenage sister.

At that point on Monday afternoon Investigators did not 
have any suspects or a sure sense of whether Autumn was left on her own or was the victim of foul play.

Her parents - Anthony Pasquale and Jennifer Cornwell - did not 
speak at the news conference. Both wept during the evening vigil.

Waiting: The community gathers near the spot where the body of the missing 12-year-old is believed to have been found in a recycling bin

Grim discovery: Gloucester County prosecutors say a body believed to be that of Autumn Pasquale was found around 10pm yesterday in the bin just blocks from her house

Volunteer: John Reed spent yesterday handing out fliers to passers-by in case someone had seen Autumn

Search: Flanked by Autumn's mother Jennifer Cornwall, Gloucester County Prosecutor Sean Dalton offers a $10,000 reward for information about her whereabouts - just hours before the girl's body was found

Autumn, whose 13th birthday would have been next Monday, was last 
seen around 12.30pm on Saturday pedaling her white bicycle away from the
Clayton home where she lives with her father, her two siblings, her 
father's girlfriend and the girlfriend's children.

A
friend, DeAnna Edwards-McMillen, 11, said Autumn was at her 
house on Friday night and they exchanged text messages on Saturday.

She 
said she received the last one at 1.22pm and didn't believe it was 
intended for her. She said it read, 'don't be like that'.

DeAnna
said her friend was nice and easy to be around: 'She didn't hate 
people and
people didn't hate her.'

DeAnna's mother, Debi McMillen, said that Autumn was often at their house and that she always went home before her 8pm curfew.

The
last known communication was in a text message she sent at around 2.30pm.

Mr Dalton would not say who received 
the message or what it contained, but he added that there was nothing 
alarming or unusual about it.

It
wasn't until about 9.30pm that she was reported missing - 90 minutes 
past her 8pm curfew, said Paul Spadofora, a family spokesman, the uncle 
of Autumn's father and the girl's godfather.

Schoolgirl: Autumn was reported missing from her Clayton home on Saturday evening

Appeal: Since Autumn went missing at the weekend, pictures and fliers have been passed around Clayton in the hope of finding her until her uncle confirmed it was her body found

Hunt: Local volunteers gather on Sunday to organise search parties for Autumn

Mr Dalton said 50 county and local law enforcement officers were on the case shortly after she was reported missing.

By
Monday, the number grew fourfold as FBI and state police got involved 
in a search that has employed helicopters, horses, bloodhounds and 
computer experts.

Mr Dalton said 
investigators accounted for all the registered sex offenders in the 
area, interviewed them and were searching their properties.

The
weary crew of volunteers, meanwhile, was looking in area malls, handing
out fliers at intersections in Clayton's tiny downtown and searching 
wherever they could.

Early yesterday, Mr Weisenfeld said the girl's bike had not been found. By the 
afternoon, Mr Dalton would not say whether it had been located.
