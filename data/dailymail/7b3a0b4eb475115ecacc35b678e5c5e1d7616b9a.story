This was the moment Islamist thugs threw a teenager head-first off a roof as the vicious riots sweeping Egypt plumbed grisly new depths.

His only ‘crime’ was to have been caught celebrating the ousting of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi by the army last week.

In horrifying footage, the boy is seen hiding with three friends from a large group who had chased them in Alexandria.

Terror: The video, apparently filmed with a mobile phone camera from a rooftop across the road, show the four teenage boys escaping onto a 20ft ledge atop a roof in Alexandria as the mob gathers around them

Trapped: The mob gather around the young men as the fourth teen manages to climb onto to ledge, and they begin throwing rocks at them to get them down

After both sides traded insults, the mob forced the boys on to a roof in the city’s Sidi Jaber district.

The video, apparently filmed with a 
mobile phone from across the road, shows them cowering from supporters 
of Morsi’s Muslim Brotherhood during protests on Friday.

As the teenagers huddle on top of the 20ft ledge, the mob begin throwing rocks at them and attempt to climb after them.

One bearded thug is seen carrying a black and white Al Qaeda flag.

Shortly after, three of the boys are thrown off the fifth-floor ledge and beaten as they lie on the ground.

Victim: The first teenager falls off the ledge and lies motionless as the mob gathers around his body

Attack: The boy does not move as the men close up on him and begin beating him

Fatal: The second boy, in red, is brought off the ledge and shortly before the camera moves away, the aggressive Islamist mob can be seen beating the teenagers, one of which reportedly died

One 19-year-old, Hamada Badr, died while his two friends were left  seriously injured.

His father, Mohammed Badr, said: ‘Do 
you know the teenager that they killed and disfigured his body and threw
 from the fifth floor is only 19 and four days?

‘All he was guilty of was that he was on the roof of the building, celebrating the ousting of Morsi.

‘But the Brotherhood waged a war against whoever was celebrating Morsi’s departure.’

Around 36 people have died and at least 1,000 injured since the coup.

Last night, Tony Blair was condemned 
for ‘rushing to judgment’ by former foreign secretary Douglas Hurd after
 praising the coup. Middle East peace envoy Mr Blair argued that the 
alternative to the coup was ‘chaos’ and the world could not afford to 
see Egypt collapse.

Islamist supporter: A man with a long beard wearing a white tank top and jeans carried the black-and-white flag of Al-Qaeda

Nowhere to run: The group on the roof was only a small part of the large Morsi-supporter mob which had chased the boys into the building in Alexandria

He added: ‘Seventeen million people 
on the streets are not the same as an election. But it is an awesome 
manifestation of power.’

But Lord Hurd said: ‘Tony Blair leaps in before he’s thought things through. We need to keep our heads and not rush to judgment.

‘We should keep our counsel... and wait for the last act of the drama which may be some years away.’

Tensions in Egypt escalated yesterday
 after interim president Adly Mansour backtracked on a decision to make
 Mohamed ElBaradei prime minister after an Islamist party objected. 

Right-wingers fear Mr ElBaradei, a Nobel Peace laureate, is too liberal.
