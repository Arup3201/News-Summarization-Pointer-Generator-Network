Toby Alderweireld has hinted he would be willing to join Tottenham after admitting he is keen to play with compatriot and former Ajax team-mate Jan Vertonghen again.

The Belgium centre back is currently on loan at Southampton from Spanish champions Atletico Madrid and has caught the eye of a number of Premier League clubs including Tottenham.

Southampton have the option to buy the Belgium international at the end of the season but could face competition from Spurs while Manchester City have also shown an interest.

Speaking to The Telegraph, Alderweireld said : 'I would like to play with Jan Vertonghen again.'But a transfer will be arranged later, not now. Atlético will decide my future, but I would like to stay in the Premier League. That some of the big clubs show interest proves I’m doing well.']

Tottenham, meanwhile, have also been linked with Cologne's Austria Under 21 international Kevin Wimmer.

According to the Cologne Express, Tottenham have now had a bid accepted and have also reached an agreement over personal terms with the centre back.

However, it is understood a deal has yet to be signed off as Tottenham continue to evaluate options.
