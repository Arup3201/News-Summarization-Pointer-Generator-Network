Islamic State torturer-in-chief Jihadi John scratched the outline of a sword on the face of one of his victims in order to signify that he was to be beheaded, according to an account by a hostage held by the terrorist group.

Spanish journalist Marc Marginedas, 46, who was released a year ago, says he and 18 other hostages were guarded by three terrorists, who all spoke with British accents. 

And he reveals that they named them the 'Beatles' because they liked 'beating' people, not simply because they were British.

The leader of the group, who came to be known as Jihadi John and has since been identified as Kuwaiti-born Londoner Mohammed Emwazi, went on to behead five hostages.

Mr Marginedas, a seasoned war reporter held for six months by ISIS, has published a detailed account of his ordeal at the hands of the 'Beatles' in the Spanish newspaper, El Periódico de Catalunya.

The hostages were eventually taken to a prison in Raqqa, northern Syria, where the 'Beatles' had a room next to the prisoners, separated only by a broken glass door and a curtain.

Mr Marginedas said the three masked 'Beatles' liked to burst into their cell shouting and threatening the prisoners, and always ended up 'beating' at least one of the hostages.

On one occasion he recalls how Jihadi John carried out a savage beating of one of the hostages who had been told to approach the door.

Recalls Mr Marginedas: 'Once in position, [Jihadi John] took a red pen and began to draw a sword on the [unnamed] hostage's face, letting him know, in this macabre he would end his days in Syria, beheaded.'

'The pen tip broke before he finished the sketch, but Jihadi John wanted to finish his work with the rest of sharpened pencil, already cut almost like a knife, tearing the skin of the cheek with a vengeance, and leaving for the following days a visible wound in the face, outlined by the scar.'

Mr Marginedas also claims that the Beatles were only put in charge of the prisoners because Islamic State commanders couldn't spare hardened fighters from the battlefield. 

And he believes this may have been a source of a grievance to them which only served to fuel their cruelty. 

Mr Marginedas was captured on the 4th of September 2013 by rebel jihadists, close to the city of Hama, in Western Syria. He had entered the country three days before, through Turkey; accompanied by members of the Free Syrian Army (FSA).

According to Mr Marginedas, Jihadi John was a 'manic-depressive', similar to that of a serial killer so often depicted in films.

Another Spanish journalist, released shortly after Mr Marginedas, has told how the prisoners had to wear orange jumpsuits and had to memorise in Arabic a number written on their back.

Writing in the Sunday Times, Javier Espinosa, described how Emwazi squeezed maximum drama out of the torture and intimidation of the hostages. 

Espinosa, a journalist for Spanish newspaper El Mundo, said Emwazi liked to carry an antique metre-long sword with a silver handle, of the kind Muslim armies used in the Middle Ages.

After enduring a mock execution at the hands of Jihadi John, Mr Espinosa said 'that encounter confirmed the psychopathic character of my interlocutors.'

Emwazi was among 'psychotic' extremists who pillaged the Spaniard's belongings to put towards a haul of stolen cash apparently so large there were rooms filled with millions of dollars.

It was, he continued, one of 'several episodes of psychological and physical torture, privations and humiliations' prisoners endured.

Mr Espinosa was snatched with his colleague photographer Ricardo Garcia Vilanova when the pair were working near the Turkish border in 2013. 

Alongside American journalists and aid workers including Britons Alan Henning and David Haines, they were locked in ISIS prisons - as Mr Espinosa describes them as 'elegant mansions' and the former government headquarters in Raqqa - across the war-ravaged country for months. 

Being woken by the screams of other hostages as they were tortured in their cells was commonplace. On one occasion, the Spaniard notes, a young boy was beaten to a pulp after being caught smoking - a forbidden habit under oppressive Sharia law. 

The European and American hostages who disappeared had been either freed or moved, Mr Espinosa claims to have been told. 

Instead they were being picked off one by own, their deaths showcased to the world in barbaric propaganda videos.

Mr Marginedas recounts an incident in February last year when Jihadi John visited the hostages and claimed that he had been wounded in combat: 'Once, on a February evening, he appeared in the room and began walking in circles to the silent hostages. He seemed limp, and claimed that he had been wounded in combat during the day. 

'He said "I wonder what you would do to me if you were in my position," hinting that he was aware of the suffering being imposed on innocent and the desire for revenge that may be raising his performance.'

Mr Marginedas says the jihadists' evil cruelty is further demonstrated by another episode in which the 'Beatles' gave the leftovers of their food to half the starving hostages while the remaining hostages were ordered to watch their fellow prisoners eating.

This, he says, was designed to sow bad feeling among the prisoners - which it did, with recriminations against those who had played the Beatles' game by eating the food.

Mr Marginedas was one of the first of the 19 hostages from 11 different countries to be released by IS. He recalls how Jihadi John first told him the good news: 'Marcos, Marcos [is the name on my passport], are you ready to go? ' , he asked in a quiet, mellow voice.

"Yeah, I replied, instinctively looked up by the surprise news that was giving me and forgetting that when we spoke to the 'Beatles' I had to keep my eyes focused on the ground, fearing that we might end up identifying these three masked by eye.

'"Do not look at the eyes!", he shouted, lifting his hand.
