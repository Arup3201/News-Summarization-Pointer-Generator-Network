Investors pulled out £17billion from the British economy last month as fears that Scotland could go independent began to hit the prospects of the whole UK.

More money flowed out of British assets in August than at any time since the height of the financial crisis, a report revealed last night.

Businesses have warned of economic chaos in the event of a Yes vote in Thursday's referendum - with one leading bank predicting saying independence would be a mistake as grave as the Great Depression.

Deutsche Bank said that the arguments against independence are 'overwhelming', adding that it was 'incomprehensible' to consider splitting up the Union.

Risk: £16.8billion flowed out of British assets last month ahead of the referendum on Scottish independence championed by Alex Salmond

Campaign: Several business leader have come out in favour of a No vote in Thursday's referendum

A large number of businesses and entrepreneurs, including John Lewis, BP and Sir Richard Branson, have previously come out against independence and urged the people of Scotland to vote No next week.

However, the polls remain on a knife-edge, with the latest survey released yesterday finding that 51 per cent of voters opposed indendence with 49 per cent in favour.

A report by consulting firm CrossBorder Capital claimed that £16.8billion had been pulled out of British shares, bonds and other assets last month amidst a climate of uncertainty ahead of the referendum.

That is the biggest change in a single month since 2008, when the global economy teetered on the brink of collapse after Lehman Brothers went bankrupt.

Michael Howell of CrossBorder Capital said: 'Sterling outflows have been an issue since the end of June, but they really gathered pace in August and now look like intensifying again with the possibility of Scottish independence coming to the front of investors' minds.'

Over the course of the year, more than £120billion has been pulled out of British financial assets, compared to a net gain of around £40billion in 2013.

Tight: The polls are currently on a knife edge with a slender lead for No in the latest survey

Panic: Ed Miliband and Nigel Farage are among the anti-independence campaigners in Scotland yesterday

Deutsche Bank last night issued a stark warning over the risks of independence, as its chief economist David Folkerts-Landau suggested that politicians and voters did not understand the full repercussions of a yes vote.

'Everyone has the right to self-determination and to exercise his or her democratic rights,' he said.

'But there are times when fundamental political decisions have negative consequences far beyond what voters and politicians could have imagined. We feel that we are on the threshold of one such moment.

'A Yes vote for Scottish independence on Thursday would go down in history as a political and economic mistake as large as Winston Churchill's decision in 1925 to return the pound to the Gold Standard or the failure of the Federal Reserve to provide sufficient liquidity to the US banking system, which we now know brought on the Great Depression in the US.

'These decisions - well-intentioned as they were - contributed to years of depression and suffering and could have been avoided had alternative decisions been taken.'

Mr Folkerts-Landau compared an independent Scotland to struggling eurozone countries such as Ireland, Spain and Portugal, claiming that investors would stay away due to the uncertainty caused by a break-up of the Union.

He also predicted that in the event of a No vote, Scotland would have to undergo a period of severe austerity in order to establish itself as a credit-worthy economy.

Count: Polling officials have already started counting postal votes in the upcoming referendum

The Scottish government hit back at the Deutsche Bank report, insisting that an independent Scotland would have 'stronger economic foundations than any other nation in history'.

Finance secretary John Swinney said: 'Scotland is one of the world's wealthiest nations, with wealth per head higher than France, Japan and the rest of the UK - however for far too many people it doesn't feel that way.

'We already have well established institutions, solid economic foundations and according to the Financial Times will start life as an independent country from a strong fiscal position.' 

Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said this week that Scotland would have to build up billions of pounds in reserves to insure against default - implying that taxes would rise while public spending fell.

Stock markets have been volatile this week after polls showed the race tightening, while the value of the pound has been steadily falling ahead of the referendum. 

Retailers such as Asda and John Lewis have said that they would have to raise their prices if the country became independent, because they would no longer be willing to subsidise the higher costs of operating in Scotland from profits made elsewhere in Britain.

Financial institutions including Royal Bank of Scotland, TSB and Standard Life pledged to move their headquarters outside Scotland in the event of a Yes vote - although the independence campaign insists this would have little practical effect.

Leading nationalist Jim Sillars yesterday warning businesses that they face a 'day of reckoning' for speaking out against independence, suggesting that the Scottish government could enact retribution on any firms which opposed it.

And the Scottish National Party has accused David Cameron of leaning on business tycoons to come out against independence in order to boost the prospects of a No vote on Thursday.
