A pregnant mother-of-four has been thrown out of her home after her children, aged just six and seven, terrorised terrified neighbours.

Single mother Tania Wall, 38, did nothing as her boys, who are six and seven, made residents' lives hell for 18 months.

Now a court has ordered the family to leave their terraced council house in Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire for three months.

More than 90 complaints were made to council bosses while over 70 were filed to police as the children's mother struggled to cope. Picture posed by models

Initially granted for a period of 
three months, the order means that no-one can enter the property, except
council and Trust officers. 

An application can be made to extend the order after three months if there is evidence that it is needed.

Ms Wall has also been served with a 
long-term Injunction, preventing her from continuing with the 
anti-social behaviour, or allowing her family to do the same. 

The two tearaways - who are under the age of criminal responsibility - used golf clubs to hit stones, swore and screamed at people and were left playing outside on scaffolding into the early hours.

The two boys attacked a gas meter with an axe in one incident while their father gave neighbours a cut-throat gesture in another.

There were dozens of reports of the brothers using hand gestures to swear and mimic guns.

More than 90 complaints were made to council bosses while over 70 were filed to police as their mother struggled to cope.

One neighbour, Maciej Kolodziejczyk, said he and his wife were stressed out every day as a result of the non-stop nuisance and trouble.

The Polish immigrant said Mrs Wall, who is expecting her fifth child, and her children had even stopped them starting a family.

Welwyn Hatfield Council took Wall to court in a bid to get her out of her council house in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, and it boarded up for three months.

PC Jennifer Edwards told JPs her two sons would have been arrested for racist abuse, criminal damage and harassment if they had been old enough.

The police officer said: 'They were still playing out at 11.30pm, their behaviour at that time of night was quite shocking due to their age.

'They aren't at all supervised, they treat the area of Linkfield as an extension of their own home and as a playground.'

She added: 'The whole family needs a police officer 24/7.

'I have been unable to carry out any other duties for the Hollybush area, I've neglected my responsibilities there.'

PC Edwards said frightened neighbours could have reported even more incidents but they feared reprisals.

Mr Kolodziejczyk said his wife and young child were verbally abused and had missiles hurled at them by the two youngest boys, aged just six and seven.

He told magistrates he had sold his Polish house and bought a new home in Welwyn.

Mr Kolodziejczyk said: 'It was a beautiful area and for a few months, this was the best months of our lives. But everything changed.'

The married father said stones and food were thrown into his garden and screaming and shouting went on after midnight.

He said their friends' cars had been scratched from one end to the other and shocked relatives were too scared to visit them.

Mr Kolodziejczyk said the Walls even branded him a paedophile after he filmed one of the boys sticking his middle finger up at him while walking out of school.

'I could see him from about 20 metres away and he was already showing the finger.' he said.

'His mother said he never did it, so I recorded it to show he did it.

'We want to have another child, but I can't have my wife in this stress when she is pregnant.

'You can't enjoy your life in a situation like this - every day we are stressed.'

Bethan Charney, representing Wall, said the mother, who is six months pregnant, disputed much of the evidence against her children.

She said: 'This is a single woman, struggling to cope with boisterous children.

'She believes she has had racist abuse and discrimination - moving this problem on is not in the best interest of her young children.'

But Central Hertfordshire magistrates in St Albans backed the council and ordered the Wall family out of their home for three months.

A spokesman for Welwyn Hatfield Council said: 'A Welwyn Garden City woman whose family’s behaviour has caused local residents misery, has had her house closed down.

'Tania Wall of Linkfield has been the subject of ongoing complaints since moving to the area 18 months ago. 

'In a move to protect other residents in the neighbourhood, Welwyn Hatfield Community Housing Trust – in partnership with Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council and the police – made a successful application to St Albans Magistrates Court for a Premises Closure Order on Thursday 30 June 2011.'

Chief Executive of the Housing Trust, John Briggs said: 'Action like this is a last resort, but where an individual or a family is causing a persistent problem we must act to help those affected.'
