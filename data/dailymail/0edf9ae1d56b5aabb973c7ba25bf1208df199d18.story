Google is to launch a web-connected TV box that will offer HD video free via YouTube on July 16 in the UK.

The Â£200 voice-controlled Sony gadget will offer access to video channels and web searches - and has a motion-controlled remote for games.

The service will also be built into Sony Blu-Ray players from October. Apple is widely rumoured to be working on a flatscreen TV set.

The new box is a redesign for Google's web-TV service, offering faster processing speeds.

Android phone users will be able to use their handsets as a remote for the new box.

Earlier versions of Google's TV service met mixed reviews in America, and widespread indifference.

Logitech, makers of one of the first Google TV devices - a set-top box - lost a reported $100 million on their gadgets.

'Entertainment content is available through so many channels and sites, and Google TV helps consumers easily find what they want to watch, listen or play with the freedom of the internet and using the familiar Chrome browser,'  said Gildas Pelliet, Sony's European Head of Marketing.

Google recently relaunched YouTube in the site's first major overhaul 
since launch, adding 'channels' and other features aimed to make the 
video site more 'TV like'.

The box will offer access to Google's Play store - the equivalent of Apple's App store, offering apps such as Twitter and YouTube.

Google promises that apps designed for use on TVs will be added 'all the time.'

The dual-sided remote has a touch pad for cursor control on one side and on the other a full keyboard for searching, emails and social media updates.

The device could be a new version of Google TV, a web-streaming service which the search giant launched in 2010, but which has remained unpopular
