Students experiencing bizarre symptoms including bleached hair and the loss of body hair led to the closure of a California high school’s swimming pool last week.

Berkeley High School closed the pool Wednesday after students complained of ailments ranging from burning eyes and itching skin to bleached and missing hair. The school blamed the symptoms on a pH imbalance caused by a faulty CO2 tank.

Water polo coach Bill Gaebler, in a letter to parents, explained the pool’s pH level was much higher than normal and that a new CO2 tank had been ordered, according to reports.

The pool’s pH level was 8.4, but should reside in a range of 7.2 to 8.0, according to a city inspection report cited by the Daily Californian. Low chlorine levels and the defective CO2 tank combined to bring the ph level to an abnormal level, Mr Gaebler’s letter explained.

A pH level of 8.4 is 10 times the allowable limit, the letter noted. The City of Berkley made the decision to shut the pool out of concern for student health, the school is testing the water three times daily, reported Berkeleyside.

‘The pH scale is an exponential scale, so 8.5 is very high (10x), and the level of rapid eye and skin irritation due to chloramines rises significantly at levels above 0.6,’ wrote Mr Gaebler, according to Berkeleyside.

‘The high pH was caused by a defective CO2 tank, CO2 being the gas that buffers (lowers) the pH,’ the letter continued.

Though a new CO2 tank has reportedly been ordered by the school, parents still expressed concern over their children losing body hair, among other complaints.

‘If those statements are true, it does raise concern,’ Tracy Hollander, president of the Berkeley PTA Council, told the Daily Califronian. ‘It speaks to student safety. We need to help ensure that students are safe, whether they are walking down a hall or in a pool.’

Another parent was also alarmed by their child’s ‘non-existent’ body hair, stinging eyes and the hair on his head turning white, said Berkeleyside.

We didn’t want the pool closed, we don’t want to make a political issue out of it. We want a safe and healthy environment for our children,’ said the parent, declining to be named.

‘We didn’t want the school administration to wait until there was a crisis to deal with this issue,’ the parent added.

The replacement tank, which costs $7,000, is expected arrive within seven days, both papers reported. The school is currently using a liquid buffer to restore pH levels to the acceptable range, the Daily Californian noted.

Increased diligence: The school pledged to test the water three times a day, as well as have an independent tester conduct monthly evaluations

Despite the curious bleaching and falling out of students’ hair, a city spokesperson told the Daily Californian the closure of a pool is not unusual, and can happen for a myriad of reasons.

The school has pledged to test the pool water three times a day going forward, and will soon contract an independent tester to conduct monthly water evaluations, instead of the annual testing previously done, according to the Daily Californian.

The pool has twice been closed in the past, according to the Daily Californian, including two years ago for similar complaints – also due to a high pH level.
