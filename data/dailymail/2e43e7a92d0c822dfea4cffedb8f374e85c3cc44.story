Tim Sherwood will watch Aston Villa from the stands on Sunday before turning his attention to how his backroom staff might shape up.

The 46-year-old was announced as the successor to sacked Paul Lambert on a three-and-a-half year contract and his preferred No 2 Chris Ramsey is already in charge at relegation rivals Queens Park Rangers.

First-team coach Scott Marshall will pick the side along with goalkeeping coach Andy Marshall for the FA Cup tie against Leicester City at Villa Park but their futures are uncertain. 

Aston Villa have confirmed that former Tottenham Hotspur boss Tim Sherwood is their new manager

Sherwood had been in negotiations with chief executive Tom Fox after the American targeted the former Tottenham boss.

Sherwood is understood to have sought a number of guarantees before accepting the role, seeking assurances over finances and his position in the event of Villa dropping down to the Championship.

His deal, which runs to summer 2018 and is in the region of £2million per year, suggests that those terms were satisfied.

His first official match in command will be the visit of Stoke at Villa Park on Saturday, and he will be tasked with providing an immediate uplift in results with the club 18th in the Premier League table.

A winless run stretching to 10 games is in desperate need of improvement.

Villa say the appointment is a long-term solution to an endemic malaise that has seen five successive relegation battles, pinpointing Sherwood’s good record at developing homegrown talent at Spurs.

In his time at Tottenham’s academy, he oversaw the progress of Ryan Mason and during his five-month spell as head coach handed first Premier League starts to Harry Kane and Nabil Bentaleb. Villa owner Randy Lerner still wants to sell the club, and while in the process would like Villa’s academy to produce first-team regulars, with Jack Grealish and Callum Robinson two promising young players.

Sherwood, who will face the media on Monday, said: ‘It is a great honour to manage one of the biggest clubs in English football. I can’t wait to get started and I’m really looking forward to the challenge.’
