The January sales are getting closer. Forget going to the high street, though, the transfer market is where most of the deals and haggling will be done.

Some players  pushing for moves, some agents angling for lucrative deals, this transfer window promises to be as active as it always is in the Barclays Premier League and beyond.

So, Sportsmail looks at 10 players that could and should move once January 1 comes and goes.

Bony is the Premier League's top scorer in 2014, ahead of Sergio Aguero, Wayne Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and the rest! 

WILFRIED BONY

Club: Swansea

Position: Striker

Cost: £20m

Swansea striker is a proven goalscorer in the Premier League and that has attracted interest from Liverpool and Tottenham, in particular. He will be away with the Ivory Coast next month and combined with the price that may put bidders off until the summer.

SEYDOU DOUMBIA

Club: CSKA Moscow

Position: Forward

Cost: £14m

The scourge of Manchester City is available as CSKA Moscow need to cash in with the financial crisis beginning to bite in Russia. Doumbia has 18 months left on his contract and English clubs with cash are well placed to strike a deal in this window.

Cost: £31m (release clause)

The Palermo forward is one of the hottest properties in Europe and has seven goals in 16 games this season. The 21-year-old has drawn interest from Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain as they consider whether he can become as good as compatriot Sergio Aguero.
