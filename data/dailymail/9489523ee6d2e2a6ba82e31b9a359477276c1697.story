Animal testing for everyday household products such as washing up liquid, furniture polish, air freshener and bleach could soon be banned in the UK.

The Government has taken a first step towards ending the practice, which will make household products subject to the same rules as cosmetics.

In a statement today Home Office minister Lynne Featherstone said inflicting pain and suffering on animals to manufacture household products was 'unacceptable'.

The animal tests for household products currently involve giving animals high toxic doses of chemicals or rubbing irritants into their skin

The Government had previously voiced its intention to introduce a ban, but today it went a step further by announcing that it was consulting with companies, trade bodies and other interested parties to confirm a working proposal.

One question that needs to be answered before the ban becomes a reality is how to define a 'household product'.

The testing of cosmetics or their ingredients on animals has been illegal in Britain since 2008.

In future, a condition added to the 1986 Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act will stop animal testing licences being granted for experiments involving household products.

The tests involve giving animals high toxic doses of chemicals or rubbing irritants into their skin.

Ms Featherstone said: 'We believe it is possible to sell household products without inflicting pain and suffering on animals, and it is unacceptable that testing in this area continues.

'We propose to implement a ban through our licensing powers, and we are inviting stakeholders to share their views so we can end this practice as soon as possible.'

The move was given a guarded welcome by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) which has been at the forefront of campaigns to end animal testing for cosmetics and household products.

BUAV chief executive Michelle Thew said: 'The BUAV welcomes the reaffirmation of the intention to ban testing on animals for house products although we are concerned by the Government's continued uncertainty about which products will be covered and the absence of a firm date to implement the ban.

'It is unacceptable for animals to continue to suffer and die for a new washing up liquid or air freshener.'

It is likely to be several months before the ban is brought in. The consultation period is due to last 12 weeks, after which all the information collected will have to be considered and responses made.

The proposal is part of a wider science-led programme launched by the Government today to reduce the use of animals in research.

Led by the UK National Centre for Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs), it will focus on maximising opportunities to find alternatives to animal testing.

Where animal procedures cannot be avoided the aim will be to minimise suffering.

The programme will involve exploring new approaches such as conducting tests on laboratory-grown cell cultures and computer modelling.

Mice, rats and guinea pigs are most commonly used in the testing of household product chemicals, but tests may also be carried out on rabbits and dogs, according to the BUAV.

The effects can include vomiting, seizures, internal bleeding and organ damage. Animals are routinely killed even when a test is not fatal.

A 'kitemark' scheme endorsing 'cruelty free' cosmetic and household products has been run by the BUAV since the 1990s.

Approved products which meet international humane standards are allowed to carry a recognisable 'leaping bunny' logo. Companies whose products are certified by the scheme include the Co-Op, M&S, Sainsbury and Astonish.

Professor Frances Balkwill, chairwoman of the group Understanding Animal Research, which supports necessary animal testing, said: 'Scientists across the UK are committed to the 3Rs - reduction, replacement and refinement - to reduce animal use and promote best practice in the care of laboratory animals.

'Much progress has already been made by the research community to reduce animal use. Investment in biomedical research has more than doubled over the last 15 years, while animal studies have increased by little more than one third. This clearly demonstrates that 3Rs policies are working.'
