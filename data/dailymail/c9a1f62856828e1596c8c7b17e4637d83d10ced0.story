A decorated former Parachute Regiment colonel has been murdered by a gang of armed robbers in front of his family in Kenya.

Colonel Edward Loden, 73, who commanded the unit that fired all the fatal shots during the Bloody Sunday massacre in 1972, was attacked while on holiday visiting his son in Nairobi.

He is the second senior Parachute Regiment officer to be killed in a fortnight in the country, following the murder of Lt Col David Parkinson, who was hacked to death by machete-wielding robbers on the nature reserve he managed.

Murdered: Colonel Edward Loden, 73, was attacked while on holiday visiting his son Jamie in Nairobi

Father-of-two Col Loden, who recently survived throat cancer, was shot dead by robbers who had lain in wait in bushes as he returned from dinner on Saturday evening to the home of son Jamie, 40, who  is also a former Parachute Regiment officer who served in Afghanistan.

He now works as a director with Barclays Bank’s Africa division.

Kenyan police said Col Loden, who was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry during the 1967 Aden Emergency in Yemen, was with his wife Jill, 69, and his son – who was driving – when they were attacked. His daughter-in-law, Sarah, had stayed at home to babysit.

Police said the guard opened the gates to the compound in the upmarket Langata district of the Kenyan capital, and the robbers ran in.

An argument took place and the robbers 
shot through the windscreen, police said. It is not thought that they 
targeted Col Loden. Police said that they stole a necklace and an ATM 
card. An investigation has been launched.

The murder took place in the Langata suburb of Nairobi in Kenya

A police source said: ‘The armed thugs were in the bushes nearby. They somehow knew that the family was away and they lay in wait for them to return home. It is a common tactic.’

A statement released yesterday on behalf of the family described the murder as a ‘brutal tragedy’. It read: ‘Edward, married to Jill, father of Jamie and Will, was a devoted family man and proud grandfather of Oliver, Amelia, Joshua, Harry and Emily.’

Col Loden lived with his wife in a £400,000 house in the rural hamlet of Broxhill, in the New Forest, Hampshire.

After
 leaving the Army in 1992, Col Loden had a career in business management
 before retiring seven years later to pursue his passion for sailing.

After
 joining the Parachute Regiment aged 19 in 1959, he served on operations
 around the world, including in Aden. A report at the time said he was 
awarded the Military Cross for showing considerable ‘personal bravery 
and a high standard of leadership’.

He was a key witnesses in the Saville 
Inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday, which left 14 Catholic civil 
rights marchers dead in Northern Ireland.

Then a Major, he was in charge of the Army unit which fired more than 100 shots into crowds.

He
 was criticised by the families of those who died for failing to stop 
his troops from shooting unarmed civilians, but he was later exonerated 
by Lord Saville.
