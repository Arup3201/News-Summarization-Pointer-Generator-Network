With its manicured lawns, wide open roads and spacious homes, this village looks like any other typical American suburb... except with one major difference.

Rather than cars occupying spaces on the large driveways outside many of the properties, planes appear to be the first choice of vehicle among residents at Spruce Creek, in Florida.

The former U.S. Air Force base is home to about 5,000 people, and planes are such a popular mode of transport, paved taxiways from Spruce Creek Fly-in 
airpark guide pilots to each of the 1,500 homes and 700 hangars 
dotted around the area.

Signs warning of low-flying planes are dotted around the streets of the village, which was used as a military base during World War II, particularly near the 18 hole golf course.

A spokesperson for Karlhaus Realty said: 'The sign that reads, "Caution, Children and Adults at Play" is the first thing a visitor sees after driving through the security gates.

'It really illustrates the spirit and vitality of this special community.

Hollywood A-list actor and star of the 80s action film Top Gun Tom Cruise and his ex-wife girlfriend Nicole Kidman stayed at Spruce Creek when filming Days of Thunder in 1990.

The location was ideal for the cast and crew because it is seven miles south of Daytona Beach and the Daytona International Speedway, where the racing drama was filmed.
