AC Milan have renewed their interest in Adel Taarabt after being priced out of a move for Newcastle's Hatem Ben Arfa.

Taarabt spent the second half of last season on loan at the San Siro and was hoping to seal a permanent move to Serie A.

However, his dreams appeared to be dashed after the Rossoneri were put off by his £65,000-per-week wage packet.

Second chance: Taarabt has been given an opportunity to prove his fitness

Milan turned their attention to Ben Arfa instead, but have baulked at United's £12million asking price.

And now the Italians have reignited their interest in Taarabt, who has been offered a lifeline at QPR despite being slammed by boss Harry Redknapp over his poor fitness levels.

The former Spurs youngster was included in the 20-man squad that travelled to Dublin on Thursday afternoon.

But Jack Collison's hopes of earning a deal at Loftus Road look slim after the former West Ham midfielder was omitted from the group that face friendlies against Shamrock Rovers and Athlone Town.

Meanwhile, Republic of Ireland defender Richard Dunne has announced his retirement from international football.

The 34-year-old QPR player made his debut for his country in 2000, going on to win 80 caps, the last of which came against Kazakhstan last October.

Dunne told his club's official website: 'Retiring from international football has been an extremely difficult decision for me to make.

'I have represented Ireland since I was 15 years of age, and have thoroughly enjoyed all the highs and lows that have come with playing for my country.

'I will continue to support the team as they embark upon their new campaign under Martin O'Neill, and have every faith that they will qualify for France 2016.'
