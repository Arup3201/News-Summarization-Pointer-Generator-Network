A Saturday Night Live sketch written and performed by one of the team’s recently hired black female writers has come in for sharp criticism from an editor at African American magazine Ebony who labelled the ‘slave draft’ routine an ‘embarrassment.’

The sketch, performed by Leslie Jones during Saturday’s Weekend Update spot, started with the news that Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong’o had recently been named People magazine’s ‘World’s Most Beautiful.’

Jones then joked about her own dating woes and admitted that while she wasn’t as attractive as Nyong’o by current standards, her six foot stature wouldn’t have been a problem in the days of slavery.

Ashamed? SNL performer Leslie Jones has come in for sharp criticism on social media platforms following her 'slave draft' routine on Saturday night

One of the harshest critics of Jones' routine was Ebony.com senior editor Jamilah Lemieux who was quick to tweet her disapproval

‘See, I’m single right now, but back in the slave days, I would have never been single. I’m six feet tall and I’m strong,’ she joked.

‘I mean, look at me, I’m a mandingo ... I’m just saying that back in the slave days, my love life would have been way better. Massah would have hooked me up with the best brotha on the plantation… I would be the No. 1 slave draft pick.’

The sketch attracted much commentary on Twitter, with significantly more negative than positive comments using hashtags including #LeslieJones.

'Shame on you #LeslieJones U combined all the disgusting stereotypes about black women & insulted your enslaved ancestors at the same time,' said Torchy Brown.

One of the harshest critics was Ebony.com senior editor Jamilah Lemieux, who tweeted ‘This Leslie Jones person is an embarrassment @msmarypryor. I'm so appalled right now.’

Moments later she tweeted 'So the Lupita moment had to be counteracted by a Black woman acting like a big loud monkey? Just...wow.'

Jones took to Twitter on Sunday to answer her critics. ‘If anybody should be offended it's white folks cause it’s what they did,’ she tweeted.

‘Y’all so busy trying to be self righteous you miss what the joke really is. Very sad I have to defend myself to black people.

'Now I’m betting if Chris Rock or Dave [Chappelle] did that joke or  jay z or Kanye put in a rap they would be called brilliant.

'Cause they all do this type of material. Just cause it came from a strong  black woman who ain’t afraid to be real y’all mad.’

‘So here is my announcement black folks, you won’t stop me and Im gonna go even harder and deeper now.

'Cause it’s a shame that we kill each other instead of support each other. This exactly why black people are where we are now cause we too f***** sensitive and instead of make lemonade out of lemons we just suck the sour juice from the lemons. Wake up.’

Not content with voicing her disapproval on social media, Lemieux has also written an article on Ebony.com criticizing the sketch entitled Once Again No One Is Laughing At SNL.

According to Lemieuz, Jones should be ashamed of herself, the program’s director and producers have shown poor judgement and a similar routine which sought to make light of the Jewish holocaust won never be aired.

‘Whether SNL will ever get it right when it comes to Black women remains to be seen, but I'm even more curious to know when Leslie Jones will get it right for herself - and our ancestors,’ she wrote.

Jones was one of two black female writers to join the show in January, along with performer Sasheer Zamata, as the long running comedy program sought to counteract criticism about a lack of diversity on the show.
