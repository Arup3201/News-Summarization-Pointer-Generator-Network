Catherine Hickman, 31, died after she was told to stay in her flat during the fire in south London in 2009

Three women and three children who died in a fire caused by a faulty television set could have been saved if basic safety checks had been carried out on their flats, an inquest ruled today.

Southwark Council missed ‘numerous opportunities’ to check fire safety at Lakanal House in Camberwell, south London, before a blaze killed six people there in July 2009, jurors decided.

Catherine Hickman, 31, Dayana Francisquini, 26, and her children, Thais, six, and Filipe, three, were killed in the blaze along with Helen Udoaka, 34, and her daughter Michelle, who was just 20 days old.

In six narrative verdicts read out at Lambeth Town Hall today, jurors agreed that the flats had inadequate protection to stop the spread of fire from one home to another.

Fire safety issues could have been 
spotted in major works during the1980s and again between 2006 and 2007, 
it was heard - and the replacement of asbestos window panels with 
non-fireproof ones in 2006 had a 'serious impact' on how the blaze 
spread.

Reading out the narrative verdict, a 
juror said: 'There were numerous opportunities to consider whether level
of fire protection was adequate.

'In 2006 to 2007 there was major 
refurbishment work which would have provided an opportunity to carry out
checks to ensure the level of fire protection was adequate.

Despite a proactive approach, the council did not prioritise fire assessments.'

The inquest heard that there were no fire seals on the front doors and there was a lack of fire stoppers on the pipe work. 

Commenting on how resistant the flats 
were to fire, the jurors continued: 'This created a serious failure of 
compartmentalisation. Had a fire risk assessment been carried out it is possible these failures could have been identified.'

Inquest: Southwark Council missed 'numerous opportunities' to check fire safety at Lakanal House in Camberwell, south London, before a blaze killed six people there in 2009, jurors said today

Tragic: Dayana Francisquini with son Filipe, aged three, and daughter Thais, aged six (taken on her fourth birthday at home). All died in the tower block fire

Infant: Baby Michelle Udoaka, the three-week old daughter of Helen Udoaka, died in the Camberwell tower block inferno along with her mother

The fire brigade’s actions on the 
day were also criticised, with jurors ruling that if firefighters had 
known the layout of the building they could have saved the lives of the 
three women and three children.

'Fire crews had little knowledge of the layout,' they said. 'If firefighters had been aware of the
precise location of the flats it would have been possible to seriously 
reduce the fatal injuries.

'Confusion about the layout meant that the flats directly above the fire were not reached in time.'

It was also acknowledged that it would have possible for all to escape 
the building using balcony on the east side, but it was agreed that none
of the victims knew of this route.

The inquest heard how the terrified victims had frantically called 999 
as thick smoke and flames quickly spread through the 14-storey block 
engulfing their home.

Despite their desperate pleas for help they were reassured that fire 
crews were on their way and told to stay inside their flats. But firefighters were unable to save them.

Miss Hickman, a talented fashion designer who had worked with singer 
Bjork, was on the phone to the fire brigade for almost an hour and told 
to stay put until the call ended suddenly with her screams as she was 
struck by burning debris.

The five other victims had taken refuge in the 11th floor flat next to 
Miss Hickman’s where they had been told to stay put and use towels in a 
doomed bid to protect themselves from the smoke that steadily engulfed 
the flat.

Trapped inside the block with her 20 day old baby, Helen Udoaka, 34, phoned her husband to say ‘I can’t bear it anymore.'

Relatives of the victims told the inquest how they were on the phone to 
their loved ones during their final moments and desperately pleaded with
fire crews to rescue them before it was too late.

In an emotional testimony, Rafael Cervi told how he called his wife 
Dayana Francisquini, ten times and tried to alert firefighters to their 
grave situation.

Victims: Catherine Hickman lived in flat 79. The other victims perished in flat 81 where they had all taken refuge together

Blaze: The 14-storey building consisted of 98 maisonette flats. The fire reached the 11th floor where the victims lived

Findings:
The inquest heard how the terrified victims had frantically called 999 
as thick smoke and flames quickly spread through the 14-storey block 
engulfing their home

Experts criticised the decision to tell the victims to stay inside their
flats and said those in jeopardy should have been told to flee the 
building.

Peter Holland, chief fire and rescue adviser to the Communities and 
Local Government Department told the inquest the default policy should 
have been to 'get out and stay out.'

The inquest painted a picture of inadequate communication, missed 
opportunities and apparent lack of forward planning which hindered 
efforts to rescue the victims.

Firefighters did not know and had not been told how people might be 
rescued and did not have any plans of the complex building, jurors were 
told.

The inquest also heard that no valid fire risk assessment was in place 
when the blaze erupted and that materials used to refurbish the 1950’s 
tower block caught fire 'too quickly.'

Community: Members of the public laying flowers outside the flats. The local community called for answers following the devastating fire

And the first fire chief on the scene at the fatal blaze admitted he did not know the escape routes out of the building.

The ‘super inquest’ at Lambeth Town Hall lasted three months and heard evidence from 126 witnesses.

No legal action was taken over the deaths after an extensive 
investigation by Metropolitan Police and Southwark Council, which owns 
the building.

Prosecutors decided in May last year not to press manslaughter charges as there was no realistic prospect of conviction.
