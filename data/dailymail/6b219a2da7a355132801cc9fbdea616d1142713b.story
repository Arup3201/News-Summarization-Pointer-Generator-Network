A mother ordered to remove an old armchair from her front garden took revenge on the council by transforming the yard into an outdoor living room.

Debbie Ballard, 47, claims she put the furniture outside while she saved up to have it taken away from her property in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex.

When Southend Council demanded that she removes it from her garden, she protested by putting out more items including a mock fireplace.

After she made the jokey gesture, people have been stopping outside her home to take pictures of her creation.

Some people have even described mother-of-two Ms Ballard as 'The Tracey Emin of Westcliff' after the famed Brit artist who hit the headlines with her creation 'My Bed'.

She said: 'People have been knocking on my door and asking what it is all about. I have also had passers-by stopping outside and taking photos.'

The former IT manager said she was initially angered by the council's letter telling her that the armchair was 'rubbish' and had to be removed within 14 days.

She argued that the surrounding roads are full of rubbish and broken furniture and called on the authority to concentrate on street cleaning instead.

Ms Ballard has placed a blanket over a raised flowerbed to create a living room table and there is a sheet covering the front window which gives the impression of wallpaper.

The framed photos on the 'wall' have pictures of her pets in them.

Her neighbours have spoken out in favour of the changes and so far no-one has complained directly to her other than council officials.

David Lynam said: 'It looks like something from artist Tracey Emin. It is certainly very eye-catching when you pass.'

And Milena Chirwa said: 'It is crazy - I was going to take a photo of what she has done there.

'She is taking the mickey out of the council with it.'

Ms Ballard said she had no plans to remove the furniture and is hoping the council will do a u-turn on its policy.

She said she could not afford to pay for the armchair to be removed and also questioned what should constitute 'garden furniture'.

A spokesman for Southend Council said it would welcome 'dialogue' with Ms Ballard if she could not afford to have the chair removed.

A spokesman said: 'People have complained, so we have to have a chat with her about it. And if she wants to create an art space, she is welcome to speak with our arts' officer.'
