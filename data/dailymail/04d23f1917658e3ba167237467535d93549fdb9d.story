However, he warned that an investigation was still underway and that some 'complicated' aspects of a case still had to be verified.

The man was declared dead at the scene and had no 'visible injury,' suggesting he may have suffered blunt trauma, according to Ngoepe. 

He did not comment on the cause of the argument that led to the assault. Police and prosecutors are awaiting the results of an autopsy.

The suspects, aged 27 and 30, were detained on Tuesday and later released pending charges, which could include murder.
