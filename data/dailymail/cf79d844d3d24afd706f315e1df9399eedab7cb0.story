Beyoncé has landed the cover of Time magazine's annual '100 Most Influential People in the World'.

The pop queen beat other names on the list - from President Obama, Hillary Clinton, Vladimir Putin, Pope Francis and Miley Cyrus - to feature on the coveted cover.

Further covers placed inside the magazine feature actor Robert Redford, the NBA's first openly gay athlete Jason Collins, and General Motors CEO Mary Barra.

Time's 'Most Influential' list names people who have inspired others, regardless of their moral standing. The list also includes a profile by another star, explaining why the person deserves a spot.

'She's the boss,' Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg explained in her profile of Beyonce.

Pop queen: Time magazine features Beyonce on the cover of its '100 Most Influential People', out Friday

'Beyoncé has sold out the Mrs. Carter Show World Tour while being a full-time mother. Beyoncé doesn't just sit at the table. She builds a better one.'

She goes on: 'Her secret: hard work, honesty and authenticity. And her answer to the question, 'What would you do if you weren't afraid? appears to be 'Watch me. I'm about to do it.' Then she adds, 'You can, too.'"

Sandberg and Beyoncé previously collaborated on a campaign in which they called for a ban on the word 'Bossy' to describe women.

Beyoncé appears in the 'Titans' section of the list alongside Pharrell Williams, 
Hillary Clinton and Jeff Bezos, while other sections include Pioneers, 
Artists, Leaders and Icons.

Time listed Kerry
 Washington, Amy Adams, Frozen songwriters Robert Lopez and Kristen 
Anderson-Lopez about the most influential artists of the year.

Spotlight: Mary Barra, the CEO of General Motors, also fell within the 'Leader' category of the list

Late Night host Seth Meyers, country musician Carrie Underwood, 'Happy' singer Pharrell Williams, Russian 
President Vladimir Putin and singer Miley Cyrus also feature in the magazine.

And interestingly, each person on the list is profiled by another famous figure; Malala Yousafzai wrote about Hillary Clinton in this issue, while Amy Poehler wrote about Seth Meyers, and Dolly Parton wrote about Miley Cyrus.

Beyoncé, who made wowed critics and fans this year by suddenly releasing a secret album featuring 14 songs and 17 videos, also nabbed a spot on the list last 
year.

Director Baz Lurhmann wrote of her: 'When
 Beyoncé does an album, when Beyoncé sings a song, when Beyoncé does 
anything, it’s an event, and it’s broadly influential.

'Right
 now, she is the heir-­apparent diva of the USA -- the reigning national
 voice.'
