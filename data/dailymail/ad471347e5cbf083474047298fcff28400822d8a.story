With her 
fellow Olympic team pursuit champions Dani King and Laura Trott already 
out of the medals  in the 3,000m individual pursuit, it fell to Joanna 
Rowsell to reinstate English pride inside the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome on
 Friday.

She
 responded by breaking an eight-year-old Commonwealth Games record to 
reach the final and then obliterated her Australian opponent, Annette 
Edmondson, to win England’s first able-bodied cycling gold medal of 
these Games. Cometh the hour, cometh the woman.

Rowsell,
 25, said she had been inspired watching her flatmates in the athletes’ 
village, Sophie Thornhill and pilot Helen Scott, win the para-sport 
sprint tandem on Thursday night, as England  finished the opening day in
 the velodrome with one gold, two silvers and a bronze for Jess Varnish in the 500m time trial.

But,
 such has been the success of British cyclists over the past decade, we
 are not used to settling for silver.

Rowsell, the world 
individual and team pursuit champion, duly provided a welcome reminder 
of why the nation’s cyclists have been such a dominant force — and why 
great rivals Australia may have to keep quiet for a while longer.

Trott
 and King had already missed out on the chance to ride for a medal after
 they could only post the sixth and eighth fastest times respectively 
in qualification, meaning the onus was on Rowsell to boost or bust 
English hopes in the event.

She responded gallantly, setting a Games 
record of 3min 29.038sec, catching and overtaking her opponent Lauren 
Ellis of New Zealand in the process, and then lapping up the applause of
 the generous Scottish crowd.

She
 then produced another stunning ride in the final. Edmondson, whose 
younger brother Alex also had to settle for silver in the 4,000m 
individual pursuit, was nearly four seconds behind Rowsell as she staggered over the line.

There
 may be more high-profile riders within British Cycling, but the serious
 way in which Rowsell approached this event touched many on Friday.

It
 was with the Commonwealths in mind that she was first spotted by 
British Cycling’s talent team on a school field aged 15 in 2004 and the 
buzz of performing on British soil is a major motivation.

It
 felt fitting that Rowsell’s beam lit up the velodrome as she stood on 
the podium yesterday, once again eschewing a wig which would have 
concealed her alopecia.

Rowsell
 said: ‘I won the world title in February and this is the one I really 
wanted. It’s all been about preparing for this. The Commonwealth Games 
come round every four years and very rarely so near to your home 
country.

‘When I started, a lot of people doubted me and I’ve always wanted to prove them wrong. I have kept plugging away.

‘Ever
 since the 2012 Olympics I have been thinking about this event. I’ve 
been looking forward  to Glasgow. This has been my  motivation since the
 Games and I’m pretty pleased to pull it off.’

Winner: Rowsell says 'it's been an amazing year, and this was the one I really wanted'
