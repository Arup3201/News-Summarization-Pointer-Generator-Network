It's almost as if these plucky critters knew they were being watched as they high-fived each other and blew raspberries in the spring sunshine as these photographs were taken.

Simon Litten, 46, waited in camouflage for two hours in order to capture this magical scene in Tibenham, Norfolk, on Sunday morning. He watched quietly as the female boxed on her hind legs against male admirers in this traditional courtship ritual. What the photographer was not anticipating was some of the cheeky behaviour by the hares, one of which appeared to stick its tongue out and blow a raspberry at him.

'There was a group of about a dozen and there was a female being pursued by about males,' he said. 'Then all of a sudden one of the males bounded to about 15ft away from me and stuck his tongue out. I couldn't believe it.

'They call it mad as a March hare because that's when everyone sees them - but they do actually box all year around. But in March the crop and corn is low so you can see them better.'

The reason, Mr Litten explained, hares can be best photographed at this time of year is that the crop and corn is low 'so you can see them better'
