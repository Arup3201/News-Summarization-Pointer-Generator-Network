More than 140 soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard are home for Christmas.

The Cambridge-based 850th Horizontal Engineers Company returned from building roads and clearing mines over the last eight months in Afghanistan.

The Star Tribune reports family and friends gathered at Cambridge-Isanti High School on Sunday to welcome them home.

One overjoyed 6-year-old named Layla Saline held up two signs as her father and soldiers from the U.S. Army's Horizontal Engineers company marched into the school gymnasium teeming with their loved ones.

One sign read, 'Your our Hero.' The other sign read, 'Welcome Home Daddy. I love you.'

The crowd erupted in an emotional cheer as the soldiers entered the room after eight months of being thousands of miles away in Afghanistan.

The soldiers hail from about 100 towns in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

First Sgt. Jeffry Taylor says the company had no casualties or serious injuries, although one soldier suffered a concussion after an explosive device went off near his armored vehicle.

Taylor explained that the soldiers were often fired upon while building roads.  

'Our job was to train Afghan army engineers in horizontal engineering, basically earth-moving for roads, repairs, culverts and ditches. We were shutting down bases and turning other bases over to the Afghans,' Taylor said.

'You guys did an outstanding job,' First Sgt. Jeffry Taylor told his unit.

'Now we are home and your families are waiting.'

He says their company often was shelled with mortars or fired upon. Accompanying infantry or cavalry units provided protection and dealt with the Afghan rebel attackers

The Star Tribune reported that Sgt. Terry Saline, 38, gave his children and his wife Jennifer an emotional hug.

'I felt like I was 16 again and going to the prom,' Saline said minutes later as he retrieved his duffel. 'It felt so good; words can’t describe it, ' he continued.

He told the Tribune that he looks forward to return home permanently and work one again with the US Parcel Service where 'you don’t have to worry about things in Afghanistan, like indirect fire.'
