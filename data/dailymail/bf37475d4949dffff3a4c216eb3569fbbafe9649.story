Oscar Piper, aged six from Cornwall, was banned from diving on the TV show Splash! due to health and safety reasons

He stands just 3ft 5in tall but in the highly competitive sport of diving, Oscar Piper is already making a giant splash.

Like his idol and mentor Tom Daley, the six-year-old schoolboy has his eyes fixed firmly on winning Olympic gold one day.

But right now he's a champion at winning hearts.

The pint-size diving discovery has become an internet sensation after Daley unveiled him as his new protégé.

The 18-year-old Olympic medallist posted footage of Oscar making a courageous jump from the 10 metre board after the youngster was 'devastated' to learn he wasn't old enough to appear on 'Splash!', Daley's prime time TV show.

Producers pulled the plug on Oscar's planned performance at the last minute - because of rules governing children performing live on TV.

Now, however, he has created his own internet following - and is set to follow in Daley's wake. Yesterday Daley described him as 'the coolest six-year-old I know', and heralded the tiny tot as the next big thing in diving.

Oscar, from Torpoint, Cornwall, was preparing to appear on the ITV show, which is currently pulling in top ratings despite being widely panned by critics.

He spent weeks training to impress the nation and was due to open one of the shows by walking on and jumping with Daley from the 10 metre board - nearly ten times his own height.

But he was told he was too young to appear because of regulations governing under-13s performing live.

His mother Ali Piper, 42, said: 'It was for last Saturday's show but unfortunately due to some sort of red tape, he wasn't able to do it live. He was absolutely devastated. He was in tears.

'Appearing on TV with your idol is something you would remember for the rest of your life. He lives, breathes and eats diving. It's his passion.'

As soon as he learned of Oscar's disappointment, Daley posted footage of him on social networking sites.

'Oscar couldn't sleep the night it 
went up,' said Ali. 'He kept asking if he had more hits - even though he
doesn't really know what a hit is.'

Oscar was just four when he started 
to dive and has been jumping from the 10 metre board for more than a 
year, as well as executing dives with complex twists and turns.

Daley, who took up the sport at seven
and was Britain's youngest competitor at the 2008 Games, has encouraged
and helped to coach Oscar at Plymouth Life Centre, where they both 
train.

Oscar’s TV debut had been set up through Tom and his coach Andy Banks. The youngster, pictured left and right in a diving competition, can perform numerous twists and turns

Splash! pits celebrities against each other in a bid to perform the perfect dive.

Oscar, whose sister Evangeline, 
seven, and brother Ollie, 13, are also keen divers and swimmers, trains 
five days a week and dreams of holding aloft his own medal.

Now his mother and father Dean, a 
42-year-old interior designer, hope producers will be able to pre-record
his performance and broadcast it for the show's final.

'Tom Daley is unique and is one hell 
of an act to follow,' said Ali. 'If Oscar could be remotely like Tom in 
and away from the pool, then I would be one proud mum.'

Celebrities: Tom Daley, Joey Essex, Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards, Charlotte Jackson and Caprice Bourret cheer on a fellow diver in Splash!
