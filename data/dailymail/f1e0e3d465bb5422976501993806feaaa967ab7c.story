Gamble?: Families are opting for holidays rather than banking their money for retirement

Workers are more likely to save for a holiday than for their retirement, according to a study.

Researchers found that 36 per cent of us are putting money aside for a trip away, but only 26 per cent are making provision for old age.

And one in five admits to having no savings at all.

The survey, conducted by lending service Zopa, discovered that while two thirds of us consider ourselves good with money, most are not making any long-term financial plans.

And of those who do have savings, 59 per cent keep them in accounts where the interest rate is below inflation â€“ some as low as 0.66 per cent.

With the current rate of inflation at 2.8 per cent, these savings are effectively losing value.

Many also end up losing out when banks' introductory bonus rates expire and leave them on worse rates - a practice the Financial Conduct Authority has pledged to investigate.

According to the survey, the top ten 
savings goals are: holiday; rainy day emergency fund; retirement; 
children; buying a property; new car; future repairs; grandchildren; 
down payment for a house; and starting a family.

The research found eight in ten of us have little or no trust in our savings provider.

Yet less than half (43 per cent) actually review their savings once a year, and 51 per cent don't know the current rate of interest on their savings accounts.

Independent financial analyst, Louise Cooper CFA said: 'Britons need to bulk up their savings to get them working as hard as they do, even more so when money is tight.

'To ensure your savings are fighting fit, it's important to know where to cut the fat when looking at savings options.

Priorities: Only 26 per cent of us are putting money away for old age. Retirement is third on our priorities list

'Peer-to-peer lending offers a real alternative to banks with higher rates for savers to help your money grow.

'If you don't like bankers, why give them your savings?'

When asked what Brits are saving for, retirement came in third and saving for a house deposit came ninth on the list.

While over two thirds (69 per cent) of 18 to 54 year olds believe they are good with money, just 21 per cent of this group are actively saving for retirement.

This is despite 81 per cent admitting they need to save in order to have a comfortable retirement and avoid a retirement crisis.
