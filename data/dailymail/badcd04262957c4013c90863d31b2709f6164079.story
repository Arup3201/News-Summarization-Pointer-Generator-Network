After a nice meal out you might get the added bonus of a mint or a chocolate when your bill arrives at the end of the night.

But when it comes to paying at a new restaurant in Oxford you might get a little more than you bargained for.

That's because health conscious eatery Cabbages and Condoms is set to become the first in the UK to issue leaflets on protective sex when your meal ends.

Bizarre: The unusual idea has been launched in the UK following success in Thailand

Sex advice with that sir? Cabbages & Condoms Thai restaurant in Bicester hands out advice on family planning at the end of the meal

Cosy atmosphere: The interior of  the Cabbages and Condoms restaurant

In a bizarre initiative started in Thailand, the restaurant aims to promote sexual health alongside its food - following success in six restaurants across the south east Asian country.

The name of the eatery refers to the idea
 that people should buy condoms alongside everyday mundane items such as cabbages.

Merchandise: Customers can buy condom themed goods like mugs, keyrings and books

And if the name wasn't strange enough it also comes with the slogan 'And remember, our food is guaranteed not to cause pregnancy.'

Diners at the new restaurant will get the chance to sample traditional Thai food 'in a cosy atmosphere' before they are presented with the information on sexual health and even urged to buy some of its unusual condom-themed merchandise.

Among them are condom-themed mugs, keyrings and books and even a mascot made out of the contraceptive.

The strange but unique idea originated in the Thai capital of Bangkok where its restaurants even distribute condoms with the bill.

In some of them there are even statues made out of condoms while they also adorn walls and ceilings used as decoration.

But if reviews of its eateries in Thailand are anything to go by, its not just a restaurant with a message.

Marian Burros of The New York Times singled out the 'fascinating' dim sum and 'wonderfully herbaceous' shrimp soup among 
the 'well-prepared straightforward food that is very reasonably priced.'

The idea came together as a result of the desperate need in the country to promote better understanding and 
acceptance of family planning.

A number of items will be available on sale as the restaurant aims to help promote sexual health in the UK

The new eatery in Bicester, Oxfordshire, even comes with the slogan 'and remember our food is guaranteed not to cause pregnancy'

Former politician and activist in 
Thailand Mechai Viravaidya popularised condoms, family planning and AIDS
 awareness in the country and helped establish Cabbages and Condoms.

He continues to oversee rural 
development and health initiatives and in 2007 the non governmental 
organisation which he founded to continue the work was awarded theÂ  Bill
 & Melinda Gates Foundation's Gates Award in recognition of its 
pioneering work in family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention.

It was also launched to generate income to support various 
development activities.

Wilas Techo have now brought the idea over to the UK with the new restaurant in Bicester, Oxford, leading the way with all profits from merchandise sales 
donated to charitable causes in Thailand.
