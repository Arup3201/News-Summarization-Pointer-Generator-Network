Police are investigating reports of a training ground fight between two Everton youngsters that left one player in hospital.

According to the Liverpool Echo, Under 18s goalkeeper Ciaran O'Loughlin was taken for treatment on a neck injury following the alleged brawl at the club's Finch Farm training ground on Monday.

Police in Merseyside have confirmed that the 17-year-old was injured in an 'argument' with an 18-year-old player and they are set to investigate the alleged assault.

A spokesman said: 'A 17-year-old male received injuries to his neck during an argument with an 18-year-old male.'

'He was taken to hospital where he is being treated . The investigation is ongoing.'

O'Loughlin joined the Toffees as an eight-year-old and has been at the club for almost a decade. The keeper - who is eligible to play for either England or Ireland - is considered to be a bright prospect by the academy coaches.

According to Everton's website, O'Loughlin's role model is US keeper Tim Howard and his goal for the upcoming 2014/15 season is to 'earn international recognition'. 

An Everton spokesman said: 'The matter is being investigated internally and the club will make no further comment.'
