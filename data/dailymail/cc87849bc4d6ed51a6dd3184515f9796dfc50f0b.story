A top Swedish skier was hit by a baby elk after it smashed through his window together with entrails when the car hit its pregnant mother as he drove in Oestersund in northern Sweden.

Jesper Modin said: 'I had just come over a hill and the sun was shining directly in my eyes, I only saw the elk when it was a few metres away and it was standing right in the middle-of-the-road.

'It hit the front of the car and then smashed into the windscreen and then the body of the elk went tumbling over the roof. I was completely covered in glass and the elk's innards.'

Jesper Modin's car was badly damaged when an elk ran out in front of his car in Oestersund, Northern Sweden

The heavily pregnant elk smashed the bonnet, windscreen and roof, losing its stomach contents during the impact

Moments after the horrific smash, Mr Modin noticed the elk calf in the passenger's seat, still attached to its mother by its umbilical cord

Miraculously the calf was still alive despite the trauma of the impact

The 25-year-old said that there was so much blood he was convinced he had been badly cut somewhere and had rushed to check himself, but found only a small cut on his hand. The elk however was dead.

He said that he had not wanted to look too closely at the bloody mess inside the car but when the pick-up truck arrived to remove the wreckage and remove the body, he said he needed to go inside the vehicle to get some documents from the glove compartment.

He said: 'I was about to grab some things from my glove compartment but when I opened the car door, I was shocked to see the was a little baby elk laying there and it was alive. The umbilical cord was still attached. I was so shocked that I slammed the door again.

'I thought to myself, did I really see what I think I saw?'

A friend of his arrived seconds later and he decided to check again realised it was an elk calf and it was alive.

They realised that Modin hadn't noticed the calf in the immediate aftermath of the crash, which he attributed in part to being in shock and in part to the car's interior being completely covered in guts and glass.

When the mother elk collided with the car, her stomach contents had emptied into the car, including her unborn calf.

He added: 'People don't believe me when I tell them what happened, they think it's the weirdest thing they've ever heard. But I just show them the pictures.'

He called the police, who in turn called in a wildlife expert who decided that the calf would not survive without its mother and killed it. .

Mr Modin added: 'It's a tragedy of course, and I wish I could say the elk survived too. But I'm just happy I'm alive, and so grateful to all the people who helped.'

Mr Modin said that he wished the calf could have been saved but he was lucky to have been alive himself following the crash

Mr Modin said people don't believe him about what happened, until he shows them the photographs
