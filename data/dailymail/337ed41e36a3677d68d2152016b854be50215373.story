Nick Clegg last night issued an extraordinary apology to the nation for breaking his pre-election pledge to block any rise in university tuition fees.

In a high-risk move, unprecedented in recent political history, the Deputy Prime Minister took to the airwaves to admit he never should have made the promise.

The abject nature of his statement, ahead of the Liberal Democrats’ annual conference, which starts this weekend, dramatically divided opinion at Westminster.

Admission: In a high-risk move, unprecedented in recent political history, Nick Clegg took to the airwaves to admit he never should have made the promise

Critics said Mr Clegg, whose leadership has been under pressure as his party flatlined in the polls, had succeeded in reminding voters of a U-turn that had begun to fade in the public’s thoughts, while appearing weak.

But his allies insisted he had made a personal decision to try to draw a line under an issue that had become a ‘ball and chain’ around his neck, demonstrating his determination to lead the party into the next election.

They claimed voters would regard it as refreshing that a political leader had made a direct apology for a mistake.

Mr Clegg joined all other Lib Dem MPs in signing a pre-election pledge to ‘vote against any increase in fees’.

But in coalition with the Conservatives, the party backed a decision to almost triple fees to £9,000 a year within months of the election. The move infuriated many Lib Dem supporters, particularly students.

It triggered an incredible reversal of fortune for Mr Clegg, who had been treated like a rock star on the election trail after his performance in TV debates.

In a message filmed in his south-west London home, to be shown as a party political broadcast next week, Mr Clegg insisted he would ‘never again’ make a pledge unless he was totally clear it could be met.

'There’s no easy way to say this: we made a pledge, we didn’t stick to it – and for that I am sorry'

He admitted many voters had ‘strong and pretty mixed reactions to some of the things Liberal Democrats have done in government. Many of you tell me you’re glad that at a time of real economic uncertainty, we put aside our political differences to provide our country with stable leadership.

‘But, I also meet people who are disappointed and angry that we couldn’t keep all our promises – above all our promise not to raise tuition fees.’

He went on: ‘There’s no easy way to say this: we made a pledge, we didn’t stick to it – and for that I am sorry.’

Mr Clegg accepted his apology ‘won’t be enough for everyone’.

‘But I owe it to you to be upfront about it,’ he added. ‘When we’re wrong we hold our hands up. But when we’re right we hold our heads up too.

Critical: Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman said 'instead of crying crocodile tears, he (Nick Clegg) should vote with Labour to bring these tuition fees down'

‘We were right to leave the comfort of opposition to face the realities of government.

‘And I know we are fighting for the right things, day in, day out, too: rebuilding our economy to make it strong; changing the tax system to make it fair; defending the vulnerable in these tough times.’

'This was Nick Clegg’s key election promise when he asked people to vote for his party. Instead of crying crocodile tears he should vote with Labour to bring these tuition fees down'

Senior party sources said Mr Clegg had decided to make the apology over the summer. Several of his advisers are understood to have advised against the move, with others saying he should address the issue in his conference speech instead.

But one well-placed source said: ‘He happens to think that the issue [tuition fees] is being used as shorthand or a kind of alibi for people to just stop  listening to the good stuff we are doing. We hope it will at least earn us a hearing again.’

Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman said: ‘This was Nick Clegg’s key election promise when he asked people to vote for his party. Instead of crying crocodile tears he should vote with Labour to bring these tuition fees down.’

Labour suggested a cut in tuition fees could be paid for by raising taxes on banks, though the Tories say the Opposition has made multiple spending commitments using that money several times over.

Now watch the apology...
