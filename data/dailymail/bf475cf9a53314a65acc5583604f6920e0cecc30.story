The Reverend Billy Graham’s last sermon was a star-studded event-turned-tribute to the pastor attended by almost 900 guests.

Mr Graham was joined by A-listers such as former Vice President Al Gore, Donald Trump, Rupert Murdoch and former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as he celebrated his 95th birthday and showed his final sermon to the packed Asheville, NC., auditorium.

The final sermon, which was taped this year, blends old and new footage of the prominent Evangelist, and talks of America’s ‘great need’ for religion.

Mr Graham’s failing health saw him brought in to the party in a wheel chair.

‘We're going to have a short evening,’ Rev. Franklin Graham, Billy Graham’s son, said. ‘Daddy's 95.’

The family patriarch was seated at a table with Mr Gore, Ms Palin and Mr Trump and his wife. Former President Bill Clinton was invited but could not attend.

The celebration opened with a viewing of the video ‘My Hope,’ which included the revered reverend’s final sermon.

‘Our country's in great need of a spiritual awakening,’ Billy Graham preached. ‘There have been times that I've wept as I've gone from city to city and I've seen how far people have wandered from God.’

The film, which will be distributed to Evangelical ministries across the United States, also showed footage of a younger Billy Graham alongside former presidents including John F Kennedy, Ronald Regan and Bill Clinton.

Billy Graham was also shown with Martin Luther King Jr., Pope John Paul II and Johnny Carson, according to USA Today.

The film was followed by a parade of testimonies from loyal followers of Billy Graham’s prolific crusades.

‘Billy Graham, we need you around another 95 years,’ said Ms Palin. ‘We need Billy Graham's message to be heard, I think, today more than ever.’

She then talked of how her Catholic-raised mother watching the televised sermons changed her religious experience for the better.

‘"His message transformed my mom's life,’ she added.

Longtime crusade choir director Cliff Barrows also spoke.

Happy Birthday, dear Bill,’ he said, adding ‘I thank God for every remembrance of you.’

Though not expected to speak, Billy Graham offered words of thanks to Mr Barrows, 90-years-old himself.

‘I want to thank you. This celebration is partly for you as well. And I want to thank you for all you have meant to me through all these years. God bless you and I love you.’

The evening finished with Fox News anchor Greta van Susteren, ‘Today’ host Kathy Lee Gifford, country singer Ricky Scaggs and gospel singer Michael W Smith  on stage leading the room in singing the birthday song.

Billy Graham has grown increasingly reclusive in his later years, this party was the first time he had been seen in public in some time.

‘Sometimes I try to get him out to get a hamburger, just to get him out of the house,’ his son told USA Today. ‘He'll look at me half-disgusted and say, 'Wait until you turn 95.'
