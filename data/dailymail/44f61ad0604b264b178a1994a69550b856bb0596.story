Leo Burrell, who was not expected to to walk after suffering brain damage at birth, has defied medics and taken his first steps after copying his favourite pirate programme

A toddler who suffered brain damage at birth has defied medics and learned to walk by copying pirates on his favourite TV show.

Leo Burrell suffered a traumatic brain injury when he was starved of oxygen during his planned  home birth at the family home in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, in April 2012.

He was rushed to hospital where doctors managed to get him breathing before he was put on a special temperature mat for three days to cool his body down.

Doctors told his parents Carol, 33, and Matthew, 32, their son was likely to be disabled and would never walk, talk or feed himself.

But after spending most of his first year in hospital for a series of operations and rehabilitation therapy, Leo defied medics by learning to speak aged 20 months.

And the remarkable toddler then stunned his parents when he achieved another milestone and walked for the first time on his second birthday.

Today, his proud parents recalled the moment he took his first wobbly steps after copying pirates walking the plank on his favourite CBeebies show Swashbuckle.

Mr Burrell, who runs a software business, said: ‘He was at home against the sofa while his favourite programme Swashbuckle was on.

‘He loves Swashbuckle and gets all excited about it. His favourite bit is joining in with the singing and dancing bit.

‘He was standing against the sofa and copying them saying “walk the plank, walk the plank”.

‘At first he was throwing himself to the floor but he just started to take some steps.

‘We were amazed and after a few minutes he was walking halfway across the room.

‘Before
 he could stand and balance and walk using his baby-walker or holding 
our hands but it’s like the show just gave him the confidence to try it 
on his own.

‘We were all crying because we were so happy, so proud. He’d only just learned to crawl three weeks before.’

Full-time 
mother, Mrs Burrell, who used to work as a project manager in the 
charity sector before becoming Leo’s carer, added: ‘It was just amazing,
 we just couldn’t believe it.

‘He was on his own and all of a sudden he just started walking. It was such an incredible moment.’

Leo's parents, who have another son, 
William, five, are amazed by his achievements and hope he will soon no longer need the feeding tube he currently has.

They also want doctors to be more positive when informing families about their child’s possible recovery from a brain injury.

His
 mother added: ‘He was born at home and was oxygen deprived so he was 
taken to Warwick Hospital then Wolverhampton for brain cooling.

‘He
 had quite a bleak prognosis and we were told it was likely he’d be 
disabled. We didn’t think he’d walk, talk or feed without a feeding 
tube.

‘It was devastating and it’s been difficult with him being in and out of hospital. But he’s gone on to do so well.

‘The
 doctors told us the worst case because it was a severe case. But we 
think they should be more honest and said it’s very unpredictable with 
babies.

‘Some children with a brain injury make a really good recovery like Leo has so they should let people know that is a possibility too.’

Incredibly, just a week after he learnt to walk, Leo dressed up as Buzz Lightyear and joined his friends on the ‘Big Toddle’ at Inside Out Nursery in Bubbenhall, Warwickshire.

The family originally planned to raise £100 for Barnardo’s but managed to gather almost £1,000 - the most single-handedly raised for the national event.
