One young woman made the decision to take control of her weight when random strangers began calling her fat in the street.

Kim Bowman, 22, from Wirral, Merseyside, lost 5st 7lb this year through an online bikini guide and is now competing as a bikini model.

At her heaviest Kim weighed 13st 4lb and was turning to junk food on a regular basis.

Kim's bad eating habits and university drinking saw her weight rise to 13st 4lb and strangers called her fat on the street

Totally transforming her diet and beginning a vigorous exercise regime has seen Kim transformed into a bikini model weighing a slim 8st (right, and left on stage in a bikini competition) 

'I knew my eating was getting out of control, but every time I looked in the mirror I felt sick, and then I would turn to food to comfort myself which would only make me feel happy for a short period of time'

She added; 'I was really athletic when I was younger but the vicious cycle began when I went to university and I let myself go. 

'I was drinking and binge eating a lot and I lost track of everything and every time I went up a dress size I would blame the clothes shop'

Although Kim ripped her jeans on several occasions because of her weight gain, the moment of realisation came when she was called fat by complete strangers in the street. 

The transformation that Kim has undergone in just a year is quite remarkable, and she says she loves her new lifestyle 

Despite the rude comments, from that moment on, Kim became determined to get her weight under control and change her unhealthy lifestyle.

A friend had told her about the LDN Muscle Bikini plan which is a downloadable 80 page guide of  training and nutritional guidance.

Doing a mix of exercises, Kim began to learn about nutrition and what food her body needed.

'It totally changed my perspective on food, now I see it as fuel. I'll look at a meal and see how much protein, how much carbs are in it. When I gave myself a week off I didn't even want the junk food! 

'I still use the guide now and I have a trainer for competitions. I absolutely love this lifestyle - it becomes addictive,' she explains. 

Kim admits that before she began her diet she had no idea about good nutrition or what she should eat 

The transformation wasn't easy and Kim began training seven times a week and swapped junk food for healthy meals such as spinach omelettes for breakfast, tuna burgers for lunch and chicken and goats cheese salads for dinner. 

This dramatic change of lifestyle resulted in Kim quickly shedding the unwanted pounds.

Within a year she weighed in at 8st, fitting into a size six with a 25in waist.

In the gym people began to compliment Kim about her transformation and suggested that she take part in bikini model competitions.

Breakfast: Cereal bars or toast 

Lunch: A sandwich, crisps and a chocolate bar

Dinner:Roast dinner, take away or frozen meal like a chicken Kiev 

Snacks: Constantly picking on biscuits and crisps from vending machines  

Breakfast: Four egg white omelette with spinach 

Lunch: Lean turkey mince burger with sweet potato and vegetables

Dinner: Tuna with rice and vegetables

Snacks: Nothing  

Kim enlisted the help of a bikini model coach Lynsey Beattie who helped her prepare for her first competition where she placed in the top 5.

Speaking to MailOnline about stepping out on stage in a tiny bikini Kin says: 'It was really, really scary. Probably one of the most petrifying moments of my life to be honest.

'In my mind I'm still the big girl I was before, I don't see what other people do. 

'When I had visited a Body Power expo I had seen all the models and thought I would love to do that, and when people started making comments about me entering I started to think "what's the worst that could happen? I've got nothing to lose"

'It ended up being really empowering because everyone was so complimentary. Now I am  preparing for my next competition.'
