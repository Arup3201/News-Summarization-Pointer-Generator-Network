Gracefully gliding just under the surface of the water, this rare white orca was spotted in Russia. 

Scientists from the Far East Russia Orca Project (FEROP) were in a boat of the southeastern coast of Kamchatka and the Northern Kuril Islands, where orcas have been spotted before. 

They were there to survey the waters around the area as part of a humpback whale project they were conducting.

According to the FEROP team - who captured this footage - the orca in this video is most likely a juvenile

Rare: White orca sightings are fairly uncommon. There has only been one other white orca recording in history

White orca sightings are incredibly uncommon. There has only been one other white orca recording in history.

Also spotted in Russia, that particular orca was much bigger than the one spotted in this video.

According to the FEROP team, the orca in this video is most likely a juvenile.

Obscured by the thick fog, it is hard to make out the mammal as it approaches the boat but its white dorsal fin slicing through the water gives it away.

The creature swiftly swims off, not hanging around for long but the scientists were quick enough to film the experience before the beautiful animal disappeared into the fog.

The footage was captured just as the scientists had begun photographing a large group of orcas which had appeared in the straits between the Russian islands.

The scientists wrote that the rare white orca appeared right next to the boat and was swimming with the larger group of orcas.
