'Banter': Gerard Merry, 47, said he 'has never caused any trouble in his life, and was only making a joke

A disabled bingo fan was thrown out of his local hall by two police officers - for wolf-whistling when the caller shouted out ‘Leg’s 11’.

Gerard Merry, 47, who suffers from cerebral palsy, made the gesture as he played at his local bingo hall but was carried out when managers branded him 'sexist'.

Staff called 999 after he rowed with employees, and he was subsequently escorted from the building by two burly officers from West Midlands Police.

Mr Merry, who has been to BJ’s Bingo Hall in Kitts Green, Birmingham, four times a week for the last eight years, has now been banned, and all because he made what he believes was a harmless 'joke'.

He fumed: 'Everyone whistles when number 11 comes out, I was just having a bit of banter. I don’t know why they (the management) singled me out.

'To start with, they said it’s a private club and they didn’t have to give a reason for barring me.

'To be honest, I did argue and refuse to leave, which was wrong, but I was exasperated. I did get a bit upset, I certainly wasn’t aggressive.

'My face just didn’t fit, there was a minority of people in there who seemed to be prejudiced against me from the moment I arrived.

'On the day it was quite weird. I whistled at the call for ‘Legs 11’ with other people, and the caller actually came over to me and shouted at me to stop whistling saying it was sexist.

'I thought nothing of that and was waiting for one final number to get a full house.

'When I didn’t get it I said "stuff" it’ in jest, it was a joke. I was told by someone in management that I had been rude and said a bad word to a female staff member.

'I was with a witness, a friend from the church, and she can back up that I never did that.

'The next thing I knew, two police officers were walking towards me and they got hold of each arm and frogmarched me out of the building.

Joke: The cerebral palsy sufferer had been going to the hall in Birmingham four times a week since 2006

Ejected: After he was carried out, officers told him he should not go back inside, so was forced to go home

No comment: A spokesman from BJ's Bingo Hall in Kitts Green, Birmingham, said it was an 'internal matter'

Frustrated: Mr Merry, who suffers from cerebral palsy, is at a loss as he does not know where else he can go

1: Kelly's Eye

2: One Little Duck

7: David Beckham

8: One fat lady

17: Often be kissed

28: Overweight

56: Was she worth it?

69: Your place or mine

80: Gandhi's Breakfast

83: Fat lady with a flea

88: Two fat ladies

'The officers told me I shouldn’t go back inside so I just went home.

'I was shocked, I’ve never caused any trouble in my life.

'I just wanted to play bingo and have a bit of fun with my friends.

'Now I feel like my self-confidence has been hit, I feel everyone in the world should need a good reason to think someone else is bad and I don’t think I have done anything.

'It’s all I’ve got at the present time. I don’t drink and I don’t like pubs. I’ve nowhere else to go.'

'A spokesman for BJ’s refused to comment on the ban saying: “We have no comment to make. This is an internal matter.'

But a source at the club admitted there had been complaints about Mr Merry's raucous response to the call and general loud behaviour.

He stressed that despite calling police there was no suggestion Mr Merry was violent.

In 2012 David Cameron came under fire after it emerged the Government were planning to out-law wolf-whistling.
