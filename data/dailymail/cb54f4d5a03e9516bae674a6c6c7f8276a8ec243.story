Prosecutors filed murder charges Tuesday against two Utah residents in the slayings of two California sheriff's deputies during a shooting rampage that also left a motorist and third deputy wounded.

Luis Enrique Monroy-Bracamonte, who was booked into jail under the pseudonym Marcelo Marquez, and his wife, 38-year-old Janelle Marquez Monroy, appeared separately in court for an arraignment, but did not enter pleas.

They were both shackled and in a courtroom cell surrounded by sheriff's deputies during their appearances. Monroy-Bracamonte, his left forearm heavily bandaged from an injury he suffered before his arrest, asked Sacramento Superior Court Judge Helena Gweon to slow down as she read the charges against him.

Federal immigration authorities say Monroy-Bracamonte has been living in the U.S. illegally after being convicted in Arizona for selling drugs in 1997 and deported to Mexico twice, most recently in 2001.

The 14-count complaint charges both with the murder of one deputy, though authorities say Monroy-Bracamonte fired the fatal shots. He alone is charged with the other slaying.

Monroy-Bracamonte is facing special circumstances that could qualify him for the death penalty. At an afternoon news conference, Sacramento County District Attorney Jan Scully said she and Placer County District Attorney Ronald 'Scott' Owens, who are jointly prosecuting the pair, have not yet decided whether to seek his execution.

'The facts speak for themselves,' she said, but added that prosecutors follow a legal protocol in making such decisions. 'We're not going to treat this case any differently.'

The prosecutors, joined by sheriffs from both counties, also declined to say if they have determined a motive for the shootings or why the pair had journeyed to California, where they apparently had no ties. The couple appeared to be living quietly in the Salt Lake City area until their arrest in California.

Attorneys for Monroy-Bracamonte and Monroy declined to comment on the charges after the hearing.

Jeff Barbour, the public defender who is representing Monroy-Bracamonte, said he had just been appointed and hadn't seen the police reports. Peter Kmeto, who is representing Monroy, said he would reserve his comments for court.

Booked into the Sacramento County jail as Marcelo Marquez, 34, is also known to federal authorities as Luis Enrique Monroy-Bracamonte, a Mexican national, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

He is a figure of some mystery, with several aliases and a history of deportation and drug crime, authorities said on Monday.

Monroy-Bracamonte was deported to Mexico twice, in 1997 for a narcotics charge in Arizona, and in 2001 for an unspecified charge, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said. He was arrested several times in Arizona on drug charges, according to Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.

A timeline via KTXL:

September 1996 Bracamonte was arrested in Maricopa County, Arizona for sale of drugs before spending four months in Sheriff Arpaio's infamous tent city jail

June 1997 Bracamonte is deported to Mexico

January 1998 Arrested again in Maricopa County for drug possession and selling marijuana before being released into Arizona

May 2001 Bracamonte was deported once again, but ICE has not released details on this instance

July 2001 Arrested a third time in Maricopa County for failure to appear before he made bond and was released

June 2011 Given a driving privilege card in Utah under the name Marcelo Marquez

October 24, 2014 He and his wife are accused of going on a murderous spree that left two dead after being approached by sheriff's deputies in a motel parking lot

Authorities say Monroy-Bracamonte, 34, fired all the fatal shots during Friday's rampage, first killing Sacramento County Deputy Daniel Oliver, then wounding a motorist while attempting to carjack his vehicle. The charges say he used a .9mm handgun in both initial shootings.

Both are charged with the attempted murder and attempted carjacking of motorist Anthony Davis, Monroy as an accomplice. Davis is recovering from multiple gunshot wounds.

The couple is also charged with two more attempted carjackings and one successful carjacking. 

They fled to neighboring Placer County, where Monroy-Bracamonte is charged with killing a second deputy and wounding a third using an AR-15 assault rifle. He and his wife are charged with the murder of Placer County homicide detective Michael Davis. The complaint says he fired the fatal shot but that she was an accomplice.

Sad inheritance: Detective Michael David Davis Jr., 42, died, 26 years to the day after his father was killed while on duty as a sheriff's deputy in Southern California, officials said

The complaint alleges that Monroy-Bracamonte stole a Placer County sheriff's department vehicle along with a sheriff's department shotgun.

It also accuses the pair of attempting to murder two other Placer County sheriff's deputies, Charles Bardo and Joseph Roseli, along with attempting to murder and wounding Placer County deputy Jeffrey Davis, who was treated for a gunshot wound to the arm. The charges say Monroy-Bracamonte fired the assault rifle at all three deputies, with Monroy as an accomplice.

Other charges say the pair possessed an assault rifle that is illegal in California, and that Monroy-Bracamonte was a felon in possession of the rifle, stolen shotgun, .9mm handgun and a .380 caliber handgun.

Investigators were trying to determine how Monroy-Bracamonte avoided scrutiny despite being fingerprinted by police in West Valley City, Utah, during a misdemeanor hit-and-run arrest in 2003. Utah authorities never connected him to his real name or his previous criminal record.

The rampage stretched from Sacramento to Auburn about 35 miles (56 km) away, prompting a massive, multi-agency police response and forcing the lockdown of schools and businesses.

The incident began in the parking lot of a Motel 6 at about 10 a.m. on Friday, when veteran Sacramento Deputy Danny Oliver approached a vehicle considered to be suspicious.

Someone inside the car, believed to be Monroy-Bracamonte, fired multiple rounds at Oliver, 47, who later died in a hospital. The couple then carjacked a vehicle, shooting the motorist in the head when he resisted, authorities said.

The pair carjacked a total of three vehicles and attempted to take another, prosecutors said in their criminal complaint, and crossed into Placer County, where they killed Deputy Michael Davis Jr. and wounded Deputy Charles Bardo.

Monroy-Bracamonte then stole a sheriff's patrol car before he was found holed up in a house hours later, authorities said.

Authorities have not determined a motive. The couple are expected to enter a plea at a hearing on Dec. 9.
