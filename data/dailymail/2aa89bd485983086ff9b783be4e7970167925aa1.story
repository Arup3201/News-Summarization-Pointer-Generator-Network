'Rich with historical appeal': The gold ingot which is set to go on sale at Bonhams in Los Angeles, California, next month

A gold bar recovered from a ship that sank during the Californian Gold Rush is up for auction - with an estimate set at 211 times it's original value.

The ingot, which weighs 40oz and is expected to sell for about $140,000, was part of a 10-ton hoard of gold that went down with the SS Central America in 1857.

At the time, the cargo was worth $2million and its loss during a hurricane contributed to the ‘Panic of 1857’ - the world’s first world-wide economic crisis.

In 1987 much of the hoard was recovered from the seabed after the so-called ‘Ship of Gold’ was discovered in the Atlantic.

The
epic discovery sparked a nine year legal battle after a host of 
insurance companies that paid out for the loss 155 years ago claimed 
ownership.

But it was ruled
that 92 per cent of the bullion should be awarded to the discovery 
team, led by Tommy Thompson, whose company Columbus-America Discovery 
Group found the ship.

Now this Kellog and Humbert ingot from the ship is to be sold at auction.

Stamped on its base is the bar’s original value of $743.70 along with ‘Kellog and Humbert’. The reverse is a plain casting save for the serial number 648 repeated at the top.

Paul
Song, director of the rare coins department at auctioneers Bonhams, 
said: 'This is a highly impressive example that sports gleaming 
yellow-gold colour and few imperfections as made.

'It is a piece rich with historical appeal that is an indelible link to the great Californian Gold Rush.

'This
lot includes a certificate of authenticity from the Columbus-America 
Discovery Group and signed by Tommy Thompson, indicating it was 
recovered from the SS Central America.

'We are delighted to offer such a rare and unusual piece related to the Gold Rush.'

The
gold ship, a 278ft-long sidewheel steamer, had 578 passengers and crew 
on board when she left the Panamanian port of Colon on September 3 1857,
bound for New York under the command of William Lewis Herndon.

After
a stop in Havana, she continued north up the U.S. east coast until, on 
September 9, she was caught in a Category 2 hurricane off the coast of 
the Carolinas.

After two 
days rocked by the fierce tempest, the Central America's sails were 
shredded, she was taking on water, and her boiler was on the verge of 
being extinguished.

Her fate
was sealed when one of the seals to the paddle wheels sprang a leak 
and, by noon that day, her engineers could keep the boiler's fire 
burning no longer.

The resulting fall in steam pressure 
shut down both the pumps that were keeping water at bay and the paddle 
wheels that had kept her bow to the wind.

In
an attempt to draw attention to their plight, passengers and crew flew 
the ship's flag upside down, a universal sign of distress, to try to 
signal a passing ship. None came.

A bucket brigade was formed and her passengers and crew spent the night fighting a losing battle against the rising water.

Treasures: These gold nuggets, bars and coins from the SS Central America lay on the ocean floor for over 140 years until their recovery in 1987 by U.S. firm Columbus-America Discovery Group

The SS Central America was recovered by Ohio-based treasure hunters Columbus America Discovery Group using a remote-controlled submarine in 1987.

The group, led by Tommy Thompson, located the wreck using Bayesian search theory, where a number of factors are taken into account direct the search for lost objects.

Significant amounts of gold and other artifacts were then recovered and brought to the surface using another remote-controlled sub built specifically for the recovery.

After the Mr Thompson announced the find, 39 insurance companies filed a suit claiming they had a right to the gold, on the grounds that they had paid out the damages for its loss in the 19th Century.

The team that found it argued in court that the gold had been abandoned and, after a legal battle, they were awarded 92 per cent of the treasure trove in 1996.

The total value of the recovered gold was estimated at $150million. One recovered ingot weighing 80lb sold for a record $8million and was recognised as the most valuable piece of currency in the world at that time.

As the ship passed the eye of the storm, engineers made vain attempts to relight the boiler.

The second half of the storm then 
struck. Without power the Central America was carried along with the 
hurricane, unable to escape the powerful winds.

The
next morning two ships were spotted and 153 passengers, mainly women 
and children, managed to make their way over in lifeboats.

However
the intense winds and heavy seas pulled the Central America and the 
rest of her company away from any hope of rescue. By 8pm that night, the
ship sank with them - and her precious cargo - still aboard.

When she left on her fateful journey 
the value of the gold was $2million. When the cargo was brought up the
gold recovered was estimated to be worth as much as $150million.

Also being sold at the same auction 
are two rare $50 gold coins that were struck in 1915 to celebrate the 
completion of the Panama Canal.

A
rare round version of the Panama-Pacific Exposition coin is expected to
sell for $80,000 and an octagonal coin attached to a gold chain with a 
key at one end and corkscrew at the other is tipped to sell for $20,000.

The auction takes place at Bonhams in Los Angeles, California, on September 2.

Also up for grabs: These two rare $50 gold coins, struck in 1915 to celebrated the completion of the Panama Canal, are expected to reach £50,000 when they go under the hammer
