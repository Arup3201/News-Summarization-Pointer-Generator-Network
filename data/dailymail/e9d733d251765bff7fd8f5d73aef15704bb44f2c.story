It started as a corner shop herbalist in Nottingham in 1849, and grew to become one of the most recognisable names on the British high street.

Now Boots the chemist is the latest home-grown brand to be sold off to an American firm – in a deal worth nearly £6billion.

US giant Walgreens already owns a 45 per cent stake in the British chain, which it acquired for £4billion in 2012. It is now set to buy the remaining 55 per cent to become the sole owner.

End of an era: Boots is the latest British brand to be sold off to a U.S. firm – in a deal worth nearly £6billion

Boots is the latest in a long line of well-known British brands to be sold off to foreign companies. US supermarket chain Walmart took over Asda in 1999, while Cadbury has been owned by American firm Kraft since 2010.

Italian tycoon Stefano Pessina, the chairman of Boots, is set to make around £1.5billion from the deal. He and private equity firm KKR have owned the business since 2007.

Walgreens and Boots have developed several joint initiatives over the past two years – for example, Boots’ popular No7 anti-ageing serums have been sold in the US by Walgreens stores.

It is now possible the British outlets will stock more American brands, and may introduce US-style health screening clinics to allow customers to test their blood glucose or cholesterol levels.

Walgreens bosses are planning a major cost-cutting exercise designed to save £594million by 2017, however it is unclear how this will affect the British firm’s 70,000 staff and 2,500 stores.

Mr Pessina, 73, will be appointed executive vice chairman of the new business, called Walgreens Boots Alliance.

He has described the deal as more of a ‘merger’ than an American takeover, adding that several British executives from Boots have already been given high-profile jobs by Walgreens.

He said: ‘I strongly believe that the merger will bring significant growth opportunities for both mature and emerging markets.

‘Today’s announcement reflects the great track record and accomplishments of our people to date and I am convinced that their skills, expertise and commitment will continue to make a positive contribution.’

The sale will mean the US retailer owns more than 11,000 shops in 12 countries, as well as the largest pharmaceutical wholesale and distribution network in the world.

Walgreens’ American boss, Greg Wasson, will run the new company as president and chief executive. Like Boots, Walgreens began as a single pharmacy. It was opened in 1901 by Charles R Walgreen Snr, and by 1919 had expanded to 20 stores selling food and drink as well as medicines. Much of its early success stemmed from selling whiskey on prescription during the prohibition era.

Walgreens has come under fire for continuing to stock tobacco products alongside medicines, but the company claims this means it is more readily able to offer customers advice and products to help them quit smoking.

When the deal was in its early stages, some suggested that Walgreens planned to move its headquarters from the US to Britain in order to save on corporation tax. But the firm has said this is not the case, and it will remain based at its current site in Chicago.

Boots’ head office will stay in Nottingham, where the business was founded in 1849 by farm worker John Boot, a Methodist who felt strongly about the need to make medicines available to the poor.

When he died in 1860 aged 45, his wife Mary and son Jesse took over the chain. By 1890, it had grown to more than 200 stores.

... but it could mean less queueing and cheaper medicines 

By RUTH SUNDERLAND, Associate City Editor 

Long queues to pick up a prescription at Boots could be a thing of the past after the chemist’s merger with Walgreens.

The American giant, which has more than 8,000 outlets across the US, is more advanced when it comes to the technology it uses to run its pharmacy counters.

Thanks to the superior systems, waiting times are usually shorter and pharmacists do not need to spend as much time rummaging around on the shelves behind the counter to find medicines.

Boots in the UK could also copy Walgreens’ pharmacy apps. One allows customers to get a repeat prescription by scanning their medicine’s barcode on a smartphone. They can then pick up their order in just 30 minutes.

At flagship Walgreens shops, there is also a no-appointment-needed doctor service, which could be replicated here.

The US pharmacies offer many more vaccinations, including those for travellers going to exotic locations. If Boots began offering these services, it would save British customers the inconvenience of a trip to the doctor’s surgery for a jab.

In the longer term, Boots’ American deal could lead to cheaper drugs, thanks to a separate partnership it has forged with a US wholesaler called AmerisourceBergen.

After the Boots-Walgreens merger they will be able to hand in medicine orders together, putting them in a very strong position to achieve the lowest prices. Combined, the pair will be the biggest purchaser of non-patent drugs on the planet.

And the traffic is not all one way. While Boots is a mid-market staple of the British shopping scene, pharmacies in the US are an entirely different matter.

‘Drugstores’ are typically cheap and cheerful bazaars where toiletries and vitamin pills nestle next to cheap electronic goods, lurid cuddly toys and even fridges full of beer.

When it comes to cosmetics, drugstores offer budget brands, usually with no testers or ladies in white coats to advise.

Women wanting a more upmarket experience have to head for the glitzy department stores and pay top dollar for designer lotions and potions.

But Boots is set to bring a slice of the British high street to Walgreens, launching wider ranges of its well-known brands including No7 and Botanics in US stores, and recruiting in-house beauty advisers.

It will sell well-loved products such as No7 lipsticks to US women, and remodel Walgreens stores along British lines.

Finally, UK customers will be relieved to learn that the Advantage loyalty card will not be affected by the merger, and that the familiar ‘three for two’ offers on Boots products will continue as normal.
