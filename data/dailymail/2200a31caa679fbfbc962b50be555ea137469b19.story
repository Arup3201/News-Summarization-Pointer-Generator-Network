The ASDA promotional leaflet which used a photo of the Lake District to promote Scottish food

In an attempt to promote its stores North of the Border, Asda decided that a picture of the rolling countryside would help show its commitment to locally sourced produce.

But there may be some questioning its 'local' credentials after it emerged the idyllic scene of green hills, dry-stone walls and blue water was actually from the Lake District - 300 miles away in England.

The supermarket has admitted using the image to promote its flagship Inverness store.

The picture, which was actually taken in Wansfell, near Ambleside in Cumbria, featured in a six-page brochure given away to households near the chain’s new £27million store.

Llocal businessman Jo Hunt, who spotted the embarrassing error, said: 'I
recognised the house in the picture because friends of mine lived 
there.

'I was surprised to see it but I find it funny rather than anything else.'

Lake District National Park spokesman Mick Casey agreed: 'It looks like Wansfell to me, on the way up to Kirkstone Pass Inn.'

An Asda spokesman admitted the company made an error and apologised.

She said the image was a stock photo and added: We hold our hands up and apologise for this silly mistake – we shouldn’t have used a generic image.

'We couldn’t be more proud of our 
Scottish colleagues and the hundreds of local companies that supply 
thousands of products to our stores across the country.'

'We should focus on the fact that we are working with local suppliers and we are not coming in being all talk and no trousers - we are walking the walk.'

It's another humiliating moment for the 
supermarket, which has been fiercely attacked for its part in the milk 
scandal which saw dairy farmers protesting that they were not being paid
enough to cover their costs.

Only one minor detail spoilt the scene - the photograph was actually taken in the very English Lake District

Dairy farmers were furious about cuts of up to 2p a litre in the amount they receive from major milk processors and many feared the shortfall will force them out of business.

Asda, Morrisons and the Co-operative caved in to pressure and announced they would increase the prices they paid to suppliers.

All raised their fees, which will be passed on to the dairy producers.

A litre of milk costs at least 30p to produce, but many dairy farmers say they are being paid as little as 24p. Most are locked into 12-month contracts so cannot try to get better prices elsewhere.

In July Asda raised payments to 27.5p a litre, while Morrisons put its payments up to 31p a litre. The Co-operative Group increased its fee to 29p per litre.
