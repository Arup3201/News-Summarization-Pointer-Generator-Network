When Red Sox Legend Ted Williams passed away at at the age of 83 in July 2002, his body was quickly flown from his home of Iverness, Florida to a center in Arizona where his body was cryogenically frozen so that he could be brought back to life in the future.

But that's not what the player known as 'The Kid' wanted.

A new book by Ben Bradlee Jr explains how Williams' son John-Henry continually fought his father's will to be cremated.

Together forever: A new book reveals how Red Sox legend Ted Williams' (right) son John-Henry (left) went against his will and had him cryogenically frozen. When John-Henry died two years later, he had the same procedure

The last time Williams amended his will was in 1996, and at that time he stated that he wanted to have his body cremated and scattered over his Florida Keys fishing grounds along with the ashes of his Dalmatian named Slugger who died in 1999.

Accounts: The new book by Ben Bradlee Jr includes interviews with people closer to the elder Williams near his death, who insist he never wavered from his intention to be cremated

While John-Henry would say his father warmed to the idea of cryogenics later in life, nurses who cared for the elder Williams say he never wavered from his cremation intentions.

Debbie Erb treated Williams in November 2000 when he underwent surgery at Shands Hospital in Gainesville, Florida.

Erb and Williams shared a love for fishing the Florida Keys and one day she brought in pictures from one of her trips.

That prompted Williams and his aid Frank Brothers to start discussing one of their fishing trips to Islamorada, and Brothers mentioned that his father had his ashes scattered there.

'Then Ted said he wanted to do what his friend did, and that is be cremated and have his ashes scattered in the Keys,' Erb said.

After Williams left the hospital, he was cared for by nurse Becky Vaughn at his home in Iverness.

She recalls one day when John-Henry came over and started chatting to her about cryogenics.

John-Henry had been a disciple of the theoretical medicine since 1997, and spoke giddily about the prospect of life after death.

'Then John-Henry, in his Peter Pan way, said, "Just think of it, 1,000 years from now, people could say their child could have a piece of Ted Williams."

‘They could clone my father’s eyes, and a child could have Ted Williams’ eyesight. And they could bring him back to life and he could feel great,' he said.

Sight: John-Henry spoke of the possibility of cloning his father's eyes so that people in the future could have his vision

Stop talking about that b***s***!: One nurse recalls being in a room with the father and son when the elder Williams woke up and told John-Henry to quit talking about cryogenics

'What makes you think Ted would want that?' Ms Vaughn asked.

At that moment, Williams stirred and interrupted the conversation.

'John-Henry!' Williams said. 'Stop talking about that b***s***!'

Ms Vaughn asked what Williams wanted.

'In his will he doesn’t want a funeral. He wants to be cremated and sprinkled over where he used to fish in the Keys,' John-Henry responded. 

'If that's what his will says, then that's what he wants,' Ms Vaugn said.

'There are ways to get around things like that,' John-Henry said.

The
 book also details just how John-Henry circumvented his fathers will, and 
the process cryogenics scientists went through to preserve his body.

Williams had never applied for cryogenics at Alcor, the facility in Arizona that carried out the procedure.

But John-Henry had faxed a completed application six hours before his death with his father's signature.

And
 after being granted power of attorney and health proxy for his father, 
John-Henry had the power to make all decisions at the end of Williams' 
life, despite his father's differing will.

Preserved: Alcor has been cryogenically freezing 'patients' since 1976, putting their bodies and heads in Thermos-like steel tubes

While his half-sister Bobby-Jo disagreed with going against their father's wishes for cremation, John-Henry was able to secure the support of his younger sister Claudia for cryogenics.

So after his death, he was packed in an ice box and quickly shipped to Alcor Life Extension Foundation, just outside Scottsdale, Arizona.

Beheaded: Williams' head was severed from his body in the process of being frozen

Alcor has been freezing 'patients' since 1976.

The two basic options for Alcor customers were a 'whole body' procedure which cost $120,000 and a $50,000 'neuro' procedure which just freezes the head.  

A third option was to freeze both the head and the body separately, and that's the process Williams went through.  

In cryogenics, the brain is 
considered the most vital organ as it contains the memory. Granted that 
medicine has progressed to the stage that people can be brought back to 
life, it's assumed that the other organs can be recreated via stem cells.

So Alcor scientists removed Williams' head and stored both his body and head in Thermos bottle-like tanks called 'Dewars'.

His head was put in the Dewar upside and rested on a can of tuna so that it didn't sit at the bottom of the stockpot.

When
 John-Henry followed his father in death just two years later at the 
young age of 35, after being diagnosed with leukemia, his body was 
preserved the same way.

Nurse Vaugn doesn't believe John-Henry exploited his father, but that he was just too caught up in his own obsession.

'I
 felt he was this little boy who wanted to make his dad happy, but never
 dealt in reality. A little boy in a man's body. He was going to make 
people happy by cloning his dad's eyes. Who thinks like that? I think he
 felt this was how they'd make their money in the future. I don't know 
if he was thinking, "Hey I can take advantage of this old guy." I 
thought it was more: "I'm gonna do this for my dad and we'll live 
forever." It was very Peter Pan.'

Never grow up: Nurse Vaugn doesn't think that 
John-Henry was exploiting his father, rather he was too caught up in his
 own obsession with cryogenics
