Two high profile Australian women broke their silence on Wednesday over the controversy surrounding baby Gammy - the disabled boy born via surrogacy who was allegedly abandoned by an Australian couple in Thailand.

Providing very different perspectives on the ordeal - one touched on Australian surrogacy laws, while the other focused on adoption in a global sense.

Before hosting the Gourmet Traveller Awards at the Sydney Opera House on Wednesday evening, Weekend Today host Leila McKinnon told Daily Mail Australia she believes Australia should look at tackling commercial surrogacy as a nationwide issue.

Leila said she believes Australian surrogacy laws need an overhaul and there should be more options for Aussie couples who want children

The mother of two gave birth two her second child in May this year - but it was a long road to parenthood for her and husband David Gyngell

'The fall out from Baby Gammy is tragic for couples who are genuinely available for surrogacy, it’s a difficult situation for women in some countries,' she said.

'The fact that we have shut the door on Indian surrogacy, and now to think we may lose Thailand, will mean many couples will lose out. The American system is so expensive, although legally safer, but for some couples the cost is out of reach.'

Leila also said that the options for couples who want children but may not be able to have them themselves for any reason were limited and needed attention.

'We, Australia, needs to look at introducing paid surrogacy. It’s very difficult to adopt in Australia, there are too many restrictions, we need to make it easier for couples to achieve their dream of having a family.

'It needs to be tackled nationally, not just by each state, so that paid surrogacy can happen here and with the right guidelines of course,' she added.

A mother of two herself - with her youngest child Gwen born in May of this year - the TV personality then reflected on her own experience as a mother.

'Some of the age limits are ridiculous. Between us, my husband and I are 80 and would be over the limit but we provide a beautiful home for our children.'

While Deborra-Lee Furness didn't know all the facts about Gammy's case, she said a safe home should be found for him 'as soon as possible'

Leila had her fair share of difficulties on the road to becoming a parent with her husband, Channel Nine CEO David Gyngell, including a miscarriage in 2011.

Prior to having their first child, Ted, the high-profile pair had a nine-year battle to fall pregnant, including years of IVF treatment.

Earlier on Wednesday Deborra-Lee Furness shared her thoughts on the tragic case of baby Gammy - who was said to have been left in Thailand by West Australian parents David and Wendy Farnell after they discovered he had Down Syndrome.

Instead - the took his healthy twin sister Pipah home with them leaving Gammy with his surrogate mother Pattaramon Chanbua.

The case caused outrage in Australia and around the world, especially after Mr Farnell was revealed to be a convicted child sex offender who served time in prison for a string of offences against girls as young as seven.

Based in New York, the Australian actress, 58, who is an adoption advocate, told Daily Mail Australia that there were many special needs children across the world.

Adoption Awareness will advocate throughout the year and continue to keep all issues surrounding abandoned vulnerable children and adoption in the forefront of the public's awareness

The co-founder of National Adoption Awareness Week launched the 'Adopt Change' as part of the campaign at Hilton Hotel on Wednesday

While she didn't know all the facts about Gammy's case, she said a safe home should be found for him 'as soon as possible'.

'You know what? Baby Gammy happens every minute in Africa,' Ms Furness said.

'There are so many special needs children that families don't have the physical or emotional resources to care for those kids.

'They are abandoned vulnerable children and they're the kids that we need to find families for.

'So I would say for baby Gammy, we need to find him a family as soon as possible.'

The wife of Hollywood star Hugh Jackman, who has adopted two children with her husband, made the comments before a speech launching 'Adopt Change' as part of the National Adoption Awareness Week.

When asked what her opinion was on the controversial topic of Thai surrogacy, she said she couldn't pass judgement on surrogacy.

‘We [Adoption Awareness] address abandoned and vulnerable children and we service adoption - surrogacy is another thing but it shows that people are natural human urges who want to love a child so there’s obviously a huge need to parent children so let’s try and get all the kids that need that love altogether,' she said.

Ms Furness, who is Australia’s most high-profile adoption advocate launched the Adopt Change campaign at Hilton Hotel in Sydney on Wednesday.

She said the organisation will advocate throughout the year and continue to keep all the issues surrounding abandoned vulnerable children and adoption in the forefront of the public's awareness.

'For decades, people weren’t talking about adoption and we didn’t have a system that worked properly and after years of what we’ve been advocating, we now have the politicians talking and creating new legislation,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

The wife of Hollywood star Hugh Jackman, who has adopted two children with her husband said there were many special needs children across the world

'There’s new legislation in NSW and hopefully that will be harmonised over all the states. We’re talking with Tony Abbott’s office. He has said he wants to create a better system.

'So pursue the adoption - we’re working on it and we’re gonna make it work more expediently and make sure that it’s ethical.

'If we do step up and we do adoption better, we need centres of excellence to provide pre and post adoptions support.

'I’d like to see this all over Australia to support the families, the children, the relinquishing parents to support everyone in this journey.

'That’s the mistake we’ve made in the past because we didn’t have support for families who had to devour this very complex journey,' she said.
