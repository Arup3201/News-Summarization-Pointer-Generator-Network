Tapping away on a laptop or tablet may be a handy way of recording your thoughts, but there is something satisfying about scribbling away on paper - especially if you're drawing a picture.

Now there’s a notebook that allows people to write in it with a pen, then digitise the notes and save them to the cloud, using just a smartphone app.

When the Rocketbook is full, users heat the book in a microwave to clean the pages so they can begin to fill them again.

Joe Lemay, of Cambridge Massachusetts, is raising money on crowd funding site Indiegogo to put the book into production.

The notebook and app will work together to enable notes and drawings to be uploaded to the cloud, where they can be stored.

The notebook is the size of a traditional sheet of paper and is compatible with any pen, but by using Pilot FriXion pens, notes can be erased by heating the book in a microwave.

Organised: There are seven icons on each page, described as the ‘magic buttons’ used to organise notes in the cloud. ‘You assign each icon to the place of your choice, any folder inside Dropbox, Evernote, Google Docs (illustrated) or your email address,’ the company said, so they can easily be found in the cloud

Write on! When the Rocketbook is full of ideas (pictured), users will be able to heat in a microwave to clean the pages. People will be able to use the accompanying free app to ‘accurately and quickly’ convert handwritten notes and drawings into digital images

Using image capturing technology, the Rocketbook app will be able to ‘accurately and quickly convert’ handwritten notes and drawings into digital images.

It will then store written information in predetermined cloud locations using seven icons on the pages.

The app will be available for Apple iOS and Android and will come free with any notebook.

It will also be able to be used to scan any piece of paper but performance in deciphering the information and storing it may be limited. 

Instead of the usual lined pages, the sheets in the Rocketbook have a dot grid pattern ‘that allows for true creativity and are great for writing text notes, sketches, and designs,’ according to the firm.

There are seven icons at the bottom of each page, described as the ‘magic buttons’ which can be used to organise notes in the cloud.

‘You assign each icon to the place of your choice, any folder inside Dropbox, Evernote, Google Docs, or your email address,’ the company said.

‘When you mark that icon on your page, Rocketbook automatically files your notes in the right place.’

Easy: The notebook is the size of a traditional sheet of paper and is compatible with any old pen, but by using Pilot FriXion pens, notes can be erased by heating the book in a microwave

They will hover their handset above a page so the app can use image capturing technology to register words, images and the chosen icon.

The app will first be available for iOS devices, with an Android version due in August.

It will be able to be used for scanning non-Rocket book pages, but performance may be limited.

The book can be pre-ordered via Indiegogo from $25 plus $15 international shipping (£27 for those living in the UK) and each one comes with one black FriXion pen, with others colours on sale too.

The firm set out to raise a modest $20,000 on the site, but has so far pulled in $194,982, which is 975 per cent of what it asked for.
