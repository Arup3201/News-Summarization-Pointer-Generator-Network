 A man who is suing a Washington state dementia-care home over the freezing death of his wife has asked the court to expedite testimony.

Donald Sheldon turns 90 next month and says he may not live to see the trial. He and Norma Sheldon were married for 69 years. He says in court records many of his friends died shortly after losing spouses.

The 88-year-old woman died of hypothermia in an enclosed courtyard at the Canterbury Gardens Alzheimer's Care Center in Longview on Dec. 28. The temperature was 28 degrees.

Don Sheldon said he wants to press charges so that he can make sure nothing like what happened to his wife will happen again

The Daily News reports that Sheldon claims the facility showed reckless and 'outrageous conduct'

Facility records say that the required midnight bed check was not performed and Norma wasnâ€™t noticed missing until after 1 a.m.

In December, Sheldon says that he is filing a lawsuit not for money, but because he wants to bring about change and make sure that a death like this never happens again.

Don Sheldon told KPTV how much he loved his wife and says he remembers the first day they met.

'I saw this little blonde girl; her hair was blowing all the way to the belt line, her eyes as beautiful as you've ever seen, and I just fell in love with her right then,' said Don Sheldon.

'I have so many wonderful memories of her because she was a wonderful wife,' he said. 'We never once fought in 68 years.'

Sheldon is doing his best to cope with losing his wife of 69 years and says he keeps her image in his head.

'I have so many memories at night. I can just close my eyes and flip my mind to whatever chapter I want, and I can just remember her. I see her as beautiful as she is, and she's never changed in my mind,' said Don Sheldon

The Daily News reports the state found violations at the home that included doors without alarms.

Canterbury officials have said they are sorry for the tragedy and are working with the Department of Social and Health Services to address concerns.

Longview is about 35 miles from Portland, Ore.

The couple has been married for 68 years and 'didn't fight once'

The care center was supposed to perform their midnight bed check but they didn't the night that Norma died
