There is a real danger of Sergio Aguero becoming the Premier League’s greatest striker of all-time if he manages to maintain a freak minutes-per-goal record which even tops Thierry Henry.

The Manchester City man scored the only goal in Sunday’s derby win against rivals United – meaning he now notches once every 109 minutes.

It was Aguero’s 62nd in the league for City – and 10th this season – and puts him ahead of Henry, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Alan Shearer.

Thierry Henry is widely-regarded as one of the best strikers to have ever graced the Premier League

Not only that, the 26-year-old is comfortably in front of every other frontman to have lit up the top flight since 1992.

Henry – Arsenal’s main man for eight years – netted 175 times in 237 Premier League games.

Widely-regarded as a revolutionary in the modern era, Henry’s capability of scoring 20-a-season in double-quick time put him on a pedestal as the best there had been. Even superior to Shearer, who ended his career with more, 260, but took longer in between strikes to find the net.

Van Nistelrooy’s trailblazing four campaigns at Manchester United – ignoring the injury-ravaged first – garnered 95 goals at a rate of one every 128 minutes.

Robin van Persie’s strike rate is healthy at 137 minutes per goal, while the year spent in England by Samuel Eto’o had proved profitable – his 12 goals coming in 1609 minutes.

Manchester United skipper Wayne Rooney, on the other hand, has taken 168 minutes for each of his 176 in the Premier League.

That isn’t a record to be sniffed at. It comes in at better than a goal every other game if purely using minutes.

Aguero’s 109 minutes for every strike – which is half-an-hour more impressive than Luis Suarez and Edin Dzeko – makes him the most lethal marksman to have graced English football.

Detractors may point to the City striker’s injury record – he always struggles to get through a full campaign without tweaking something – as reason enough to suggest he can never be named No 1.

But even last year, when Aguero spent two months on the sidelines, he was up there with Suarez and Daniel Sturridge.

His manager Manuel Pellegrini said last December that this season’s top scorer was a better player than the Uruguayan.

‘Suarez is a very important striker, but I think Sergio participates more in the game,’ Pellegrini claimed. ‘He has always been a top player and he has always scored goals, but I think at this moment, he has added working for the team without the ball, which is also important for him.’

The Chilean certainly isn’t wrong – Aguero contributes so much more – but it is for his goalscoring that he will be remembered most fondly for.

There was never any danger of Gael Clichy’s centre not ending up nestled beyond David de Gea at the Etihad Stadium this weekend. It is that sort of clinical finishing that sets him apart. He rarely needs more than one chance.

While Aguero offers much more across the width of a pitch and in behind defenders, there are a number of players who have merely relied on their prowess in front of goal to retain a spot in the upper echelons of this all-time Premier League list.

Javier Hernandez, now at Real Madrid, was renowned for doing very little in United games before a ball broke inside the opposition penalty area, while Adam Le Fondre – whose record is only topped by Henry and Aguero – has forever been an impact substitute.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer often saved Manchester United late on in games after being called from the bench

Shearer was chief penalty taker wherever he played, while Ivan Klasnic’s 20 Bolton goals tended to come in gluts (and often from the bench) before Owen Coyle sent him packing.

Unsurprisingly, both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Owen feature, although their records of a goal every 150 minutes might have been better if the pair didn’t spend so much time coming back from injuries.

Derby’s Branko Strupar makes the list, but his four years at Pride Park from 1999 actually only brought about 15 goals, with Tony Yeboah’s record slightly more impressive.

Of the current crop to surprise, Andre Schurrle and Wilfried Bony both make the top 25.

Whether Aguero’s record can be beaten remains to be seen, but it looks doubtful.
