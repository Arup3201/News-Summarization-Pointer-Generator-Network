A 15-year-old boy has been charged over the gang rape of a six-year-old girl on Mornington Island.

The teenager allegedly assaulted the girl last April and has been charged under the Youth Justice Act.

It was alleged the girl was attacked by four teenage boys aged between 14 and 16, The Courier Mail reported.

She was reportedly taken from an Aboriginal community on the island to Townsville Hospital after the attack.

A Queensland Police Service spokesman said the charges laid on Tuesday relate to that investigation.

No other charges have yet been laid and it's understood investigations are continuing.

Mornington Island is the largest of the North Wellesley Islands off the northern Queensland coast and has an indigenous population of more than 1000, primarily Lardil people.

At the time of the incident, it was understood the group who were thought to be involved in the incident were taken from the island, with permission from the family.

This was done as it was feared tensions would flare in the community and trigger a riot, News Corp reported.

The four teenagers were put into the care of the Department of Child Safety in Mt Isa, in Queensland's north-west.

News of the attack even reached the ears of then-premier Campbell Newman.

Mornington Island has a history of unrest between families, which are further agitated by drinking issues and physical violence.

Police on the island have had to deal with extensive sly-grogging and home brew production.
