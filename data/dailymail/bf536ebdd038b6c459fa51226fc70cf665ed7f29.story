You can forget taking a cigarette break if you work at this hospital - and don’t even think about coming in until you’ve washed your scrubs.

Christus St. Frances Cabrini Hospital in Alexandria, Louisiana, will soon ban employees from working if their clothing smells like smoke.

The hospital is banning the use of tobacco products by employees while on their shifts from next July, including when they are on breaks.

The ‘100 per cent tobacco-free’ policy will expand the one put in place two years ago for employees of the women's and children's areas.

Hospital administrator Lisa R. Lauve said letters were sent around two months ago to ‘all of our associates to their homes’.

‘We sent a letter notifying them that they had a year to make whatever adjustments they needed to make to be able to comply with the policy.’

Smoking was banned from within 50ft of public buildings there in 2006 but patients are still exposed to too much smoke from clothes, she said.

Hospital officials are aiming to reduce patients' and employees' exposure to toxins that linger in fabrics from a recently burned cigarette.

Tobacco use is Louisiana’s 
leading cause of preventable death.

It claims 6,400 lives and costs the
state around $1.47billion annually.

Such toxins from third-hand smoke present a special danger for the developing brains of infants and small children.

Ideally Cabrini hospital policymakers would like to see all employees quit tobacco products for good, Ms Lauve said.

‘Plans are in place to provide cessation support and services to those patients and associates who are ready to quit,’ she wrote on Town Talk.
