Carl Frampton and Chris Avalos clashed at the weigh-in for their world title fight in Belfast, with the champion claiming his opponent's mum spat chewing gum at him.

Frampton, who holds the IBF super-bantamweight title, was given a rousing reception as he tipped the scales on the limit at 122lbs.

Avalos came just inside before shoving his unbeaten opponent as the two came face-to-face.

'Unbelievable turnout for the weigh-in,' Frampton tweeted. 'Thank you for the amazing support as usual. It's staying here in Belfast.

'On another note, Avalos' mother hit me with a bit of chewing gum straight out of her mouth. Lovely lady she is.'

Frampton's trainer Shane McGuigan added: 'Great turn out for the weigh-in. Thanks for all the support, as always. Avalos will pay for his disrespectful gestures.' 

Frampton and Avalos have clashed several times since the fight was announced last year.

'If I turn up, I'll win the fight, simple as that,' Frampton said this week.

'I want to keep on winning and look explosive in every single contest. He's cocky but I'll knock that out of him.

'I'll go in there expecting a tough fight. I'm the biggest punching super-bantamweight in the world so it's not rocket science what's going to happen.

'I'm ready for him, I'm well prepared and I'm going to knock him out.'

Whether it is merely bravado or genuine belief, Avalos has fought fire with fire in the build-up. 

'I'm ready for him, I'm well prepared and I'm going to knock him out,' he said.
