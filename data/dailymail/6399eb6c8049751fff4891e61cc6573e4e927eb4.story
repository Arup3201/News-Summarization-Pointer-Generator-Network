Mother-of-three Claire Mosby, pictured leaving court yesterday, is facing a lengthy prison sentence for stealing from school funds

A gambling addict is facing prison after she stole more than £30,000 from a safe at the school where she was a governor.

Claire Mosby, 38, took the dinner money from Swarcliffe Primary School, Leeds, over a two year period while she was an office manager.

She was found guilty of stealing £31,000 that was collected from parents for dinners, breakfast, after school clubs and trips.

Leeds Crown Court heard that mother-of-three Mosby had a gambling addiction and she used the funds to feed her habit as well as pay off debts.

Bank records showed that she spent money on gambling and bingo websites and there were cash withdrawals from and ATM near to a branch of Mecca Bingo.

As an 'act of leniency', Mosby was released until after Christmas and will be sentenced in the New Year. Judge Christopher Batty warned her that she faces a 'significant' prison sentence.

Suspicions were first raised when Kate Davison, a school finance officer from the local authority, raised concerns over low income levels in the dinner money account.

She tried to meet Mosby, a former governor at the school, but over a period of months she was 'obstructive'.

Finally Ms Davison discovered a £17,000 shortfall and Mosby was unable to explain the gap in the school's finances.

In March last year a search of a safe was carried out and envelopes with Mosby's handwriting were found to have money missing.

More than £30,000 went missing from a safe at Swarcliffe Primary School in Leeds, West Yorkshire

She was suspended and later admitted taking loans from doorstep lenders.

During the trial Mosby claimed she was afraid to report cash going missing from a safe as she would be putting the headteacher Susan Sanderson under suspicion.

Giving evidence, Mosby told the jury: 'I thought people would think it was me. I thought if I reported it I was accusing Susan Sanderson of taking it.'

The court heard Mosby spent around £2,000 pounds on gaming websites during the period the alleged theft took place.

Mosby said she sometimes went to Mecca bingo with her husband or would enjoy playing at home online.
