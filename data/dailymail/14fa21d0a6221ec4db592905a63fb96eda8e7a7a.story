The Victorian Government will introduce Australia's first ever sexting laws to parliament this week, which would see people who send explicit pictures of others without their consent charged by police.

The new legislation would also protect people under 18 who send sexts from being convicted of child pornography offences and placed on the Sex Offenders Register.

The changes were the result of the Victorian Parliament Law Reform Committee's Inquiry Into Sexting.

The Victorian Government will make it an offence to intentionally distribute, or threaten to distribute, an intimate image of another person without their consent

The government will make it an offence to intentionally distribute, or threaten to distribute, an intimate image of another person without their consent.

'This new law will respond specifically to the issue of sexting to ensure that appropriate penalties apply to those who misuse this technology,' Attorney-General Robert Clark said.

'This will continue to make clear that such behaviour is unacceptable and illegal.'

Also under the new laws, people under 18 will not be convicted of a child pornography offence if they create, possess or distribute a sext of themselves or of a child less than two years younger than them, The Age reported.

But this exemption would not apply to teenagers if the images depict a sexual assault or to adults.

Currently, all sexts that capture a person under 18 are considered child pornography, and young people who distribute such images are treated as child pornographers.
