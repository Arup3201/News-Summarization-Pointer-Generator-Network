She's chaired a charity meeting and hosted the Panamanian president on a state visit already this week but there appears to be no let up in Queen Letizia's busy schedule.

Today, Europe's newest monarch spent the morning with a delegation from internet safety campaigners Alia2 - and managed to look the business while she did it.

Neat in a crisp white shirt and tiered black and white skirt, Letizia was every inch the style icon as she chatted to the campaigners at the Zarzuela Palace.

Important work: The Spanish queen hosted campaigners from the Alia2 Foundation at the Zarzuela Palace

Alia2 is a Spanish charity that works to combat child pornography and also help children bullied, harassed or intimidated online.

Queen Letizia's work with the charity dovetails with her other philanthropic interests, many of which focus on child welfare.

More recent additions to the royal portfolio include work with disability campaigners, with Letizia spending Tuesday chairing a meeting of the Royal Board for Disability.

The Spanish Queen and her husband King Felipe have had a busy work since returning from their annual summer holiday in Mallorca at the weekend.

Along with Tuesday's meeting, Monday saw
 the 41-year-old royal welcome Lorena Castillo de Varela, Panama's first
 lady, to the Zarzuela Palace as part of an official state visit.

Pretty in a
 cream dress embroidered with seed pearls, Letizia showed off her 
glamorous sense of style, accessorising the look with nude patent peep 
toe shoes and pearl earrings.

Not
 to be outdone, King Felipe, dapper in a dark suit, showed off his salt-and-pepper holiday beard - a new look for 
the usually clean-shaven royal.

The visit was one of the first engagements
 of an action-packed schedule planned for September, culminating in a 
visit to New York.Â 

There, the Spanish king will address the UN General Assembly in a bid to secure one of the seats on the Security Council for Spain.
