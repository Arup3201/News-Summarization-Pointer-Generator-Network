Just days after the FBI urged members of the military to clear their social media accounts of anything that might draw attention to them for fear of an ISIS attack in the homeland, one very important members of the armed forces has gone out and ignored their request.

Medal of Honor winner Dakota Meyer, who served in the Marines for four years, has used both his Twitter and Facebook to taunt members of ISIS, calling them 'cowards.'

And now, many around the country are applauding his actions.

Standing strong: Medal of Honor winner Dakota Meyer has ignored the FBI's request to not taunt ISIS on social media

Proud soldier: Meyer served for four years in the Marines

Won't back down: On Twitter, Meyer invited ISIS members to his book club

'When I start having to change my life because I'm worried about something that could happen to me, that means terrorism is winning," he told ABC News. 

'That means terrorism is working.'

He then added, 'I refuse to let these idealistic, radical bullies change the way that I live.' 

FBI officials had released this warning on Monday in fear there may be a copycat attack in the United States similar to the one that happened this past October in Canada, when two soldiers were killed in two separate incidents by young men who claimed they were ISIS followers in the span of just one week.

Meyer does not seem to be concerned though, posting his first amusing threat to Twitter on Tuesday, which showed him smoking a pipe and reading a Marine handbook. 

'Wonder if any ISIS members want to drop by and join my book club,' wrote Meyer.

He also wrote on Tuesday, in a post on the website Scout, 'If ISIS is using social media to track me, that's a dream come true in my book. These guys are a bunch of bullies that just prey on the weak.' 

'I can't travel over there anymore now that I'm out of the Marine Corps, so having them come to me would help out a lot. ISIS targeting the U.S. military is like a sheep targeting a lion. Hopefully one of these a**holes actually shows up. They'll definitely get more than they want at my place!'

He then closed by saying, 'I'll take the responsibility to be the liaison for the military. I live in Columbia, Kentucky—oops, is that too much information? Oh well.'

They won't win: Meyer also said if he backs down that would mean 'terrorism is winning'

American hero: Meyer received his medal for repeatedly entering a kill zone in Afghanistan and saving 36 troops

Meyer was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2011 after repeatedly charging into a kill zone during a 2009 ambush in Kunar Province, Afghanistan in search of four of his missing soldiers.

He was able to rescue 36 troops and kill eight Taliban attackers despite being shot in the arms.

He was not however able to save his four fellow soldiers and friends who he went in search of, though he did make sure to go back and carry each of their bodies to safety.

'Because of your humble example, our kids — especially back in Columbia, Kentucky, in small towns all across America — they’ll know that no matter who you are or where you come from, you can do great things as a citizen and as a member of the American family,' said President Obama at his ceremony.
