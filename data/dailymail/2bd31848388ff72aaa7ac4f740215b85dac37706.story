John Terry will make his 500th appearance as Chelsea captain against Crystal Palace on Saturday!

He’s one of those players I look at and think: ‘I wish I’d had the chance to play with you.’

If John Terry had been at Liverpool when I was there, we’d have won titles. We were a John Terry away from being the best team in the country.

Three Premier League titles

One Champions League medal

One Europa League medal

Five FA Cup winner's medals

Two League Cups

Two Community Shields

The way he plays, the way he organises, the way he leads his team...to have captained Chelsea, at the highest level, for 500 games is an achievement deserving of great praise. 

He’s the best I have ever seen at defending the near post, reading the danger and taking a position to deal with the threat. 

He reads the problem and assesses the angle. His positional play, overcoming a lack of pace, and his skill remind me of Bobby Moore.

Before anyone takes offence at that comparison, Bobby was - of course - a different type of defender and England’s World Cup-winning captain, but he too had to rely on his magnificent reading of the game.
