There's now a confidential number to call if you're questioning your faith in a higher power.

But instead of steering you back towards the flock, the volunteers behind the hotline hope to provide a sympathetic ear for your skepticism.

CNN reports that Recovering from Religion, a secular group for those who have left or are leaving their faith, launched a hotline Friday for those questioning their religion.

Nearly 100 volunteers will take confidential, anonymous calls at 1-84-I-DOUBT-IT on weekends and on weekday nights.

Questioning?: Instead of pushing callers back towards the flock or into the arms of atheists, Recovering from Religion says its hotline will try to provide options and tips for those questioning their faith

Sarah Morehead, the organization's executive director, said the aim is not to make callers atheists or even provide counseling.

Instead, the operators are there to listen and guide callers to other resources, whether that is finding another organization better suited to the caller's beliefs or referring those struggling with emotional anguish to counselors or a suicide hotline.

It was the hundreds of emails and calls that led Recovering from Religion to start the hotline, according to Morehead. 

Doubts about God and their faith troubled those who contacted the organization, but without anyone to confide in, they experience depression and emotional turmoil.

'Many people feel isolated or rejected when they begin to ask questions,' Morehead said. 'If churches suddenly started welcoming doubters to their potlucks, the hot line project wouldn't be necessary.'

The hotline does not use a centralized call center, and instead sends calls to volunteers through a virtual network. 

Doubters: Sarah Morehead, executive director of Recovering from Religion, said individuals reach out to her organization because skeptics feel excluded at their own churches

International Association of Peer Specialists executive director Steve Harrington says there are more and more groups like Recovering from Religion that provide counseling one on one.

Unlike traditional treatment options, peer counseling works to connect individuals with others who have had similar experiences and can offer their own background as instruction.

'Peer supporters ask questions but don't provide answers,' Harrington said. 'They help people find their own answers.'
