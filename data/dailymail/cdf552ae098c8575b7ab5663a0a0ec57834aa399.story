Russia is demanding an investigation into the alleged use of ‘chemical weapons’ against separatists in the east of Ukraine as the two countries agreed to extend their ceasefire.

Pro-separatist rebels have claimed that people showing symptoms of chlorine poisoning had been admitted to hospital following an alleged attack carried out by Ukrainian Special Forces near Slavyansk.

The accusations, which follow claims of 'phosphorous fire bombs' being dropped on villages in southeastern Ukraine this month, led to Russian diplomats urging an investigation.

‘This is horrible. This case must be investigated,’ said Russia's UN envoy Vitaly Churkin.

The Russian ambassador to Holland, Roman Kolodkin, said a complaint could be submitted to the Organisation for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons amid claims that Chloropicrin was used by pro-Kiev forces. Earlier there was claims that ‘phosphorus fumes’ led to poisoning.

One rebel leader in Donetsk, Igor Strelkov, said there had been a number of cases. ‘We are collecting sample materials and are going to present them as evidence.’

The demands came as the leaders of Russia and Ukraine agreed to work towards extending a fragile ceasefire between Kiev and pro-Kremlin militias.

Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko also promised to set up effective border controls, French president Francois Hollande's office said on Monday.

Head to head: Vladimir Putin and newly elected Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko will now try to work towards extending ceasefire and to work on the liberation of more hostages and prisoners

Still fighting: Both sides have been accused of ignoring the agreement of ceasefire, particularly in the eastern regions where support for rebels is strong

The two men spoke during a four-way teleconference call that also included Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

After
 what Hollande's office said was a long conversation, Putin and 
Poroshenko also agreed to work on the liberation of more hostages and 
prisoners and the organisation of 'substantial tripartite negotiations,' the statement said.

Petro 
had urged Putin on Sunday to strengthen Russian control over its borders
 to prevent militants and arms entering Ukraine after violence broke a 
truce there.

The ceasefire, 
declared by Poroshenko on June 20 to allow for peace talks with the 
pro-Russian rebels, was due to expire on Monday, a deadline also set by 
EU leaders considering new sanctions against Russia.

However, just Monday morning, the city of Slovyansk, in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine came under shelling from government forces.

The
 European Union, which signed an historic free-trade pact with Ukraine 
on Friday, has warned it could impose more sanctions on Moscow unless 
pro-Russian rebels act to wind down the crisis in the east of the 
country by Monday.

Potential proof: This video was released by  Russian media earlier this month, and allegedly shows white phosphorous bombs being dropped on a Ukranian city

White light: According to witnesses of the shelling on June 12, the bombs dropped were incendiary phosphorous bombs, a type of weapon which is banned by the UN, something  firmly denied by Kiev

Putin again urged an extension of the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine and setting up a control mechanism to monitor the truce with the participation of the OSCE security body , the Kremlin said in a separate statement after the talks.

'The leaders spoke in favour of convening a third round of consultations between Kiev and south-eastern regions as soon as possible,' it added.

Killed: Russian cameraman Anatoly Klyan, 68, died from injuries after being shot in the stomach outside a military compound in Donetsk

However, later on Monday, Moscow accused Ukraine of breaking the ceasefire after a cameraman working for Russian state television was killed.

Anatoly Klyan, 68, was shot in the stomach outside a military compound in the city of Donetsk, Moscow’s Channel One TV reported.

He was among a group of journalists that had been allowed to enter compound to film soldiers being picked up by their mothers, when an unidentified gunman opened fire.

Mr Klyan, 68, who had worked for the state channel for 40 years, is the fifth journalist to be killed since the fighting began in April between Ukrainian government troops and armed pro-Russia separatists.

Russia's Foreign Ministry blamed the attack on Ukrainian soldiers and demanded an objective investigation into the attack and for those responsible to be punished.

Video footage of the attack broadcast on Channel One showed Klyan continuing to film inside the bus even after he was shot in the stomach, stopping only when he grew weak and telling his colleagues: 'I can't hold the camera any longer.'

Other journalists helped him into a passing car to be taken to a nearby medical center, but the television station said doctors were unable to save him.
