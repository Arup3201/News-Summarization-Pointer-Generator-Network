An Illinois man has set the bar rather high for other men with a creative proposal to his now-fiancee in a local movie theater.

Jake and Kristen had been together for about two years when they made a fateful trip to their local cinema, where they routinely see a film together almost every week.

This time was different though: they were the coming attraction.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Movie date: Jake and Kristen's regular movie night proved more momentous than usual

Previews: Jake is looking on edge while Kristen, blissfully unaware, leans back into her chair

Jake told his friend Brock Newell that he wanted to propose to Kristen with a movie trailer, and the two concocted a plot based on how Jake and Kristen met, their first fight, all the way through to a romantic proposal.

Directed and produced by Newell, the trailer begins just like any other.

Kristen can be seen as it begins staring expectantly at the screen while Jake beside her gnaws on his fingernails.

So far, so normal: Jake's movie-trailer proposal begins

The trailer documents the couple's first meeting, when they were each performing wingman/woman duties for their respective friends.

As movie-trailer Jake tells movie-trailer Kristen that he'll buy her a tequila if she can convince another bar patron to let her wear his sombrero, the penny drops and Kristen can be seen clutching Jake's arm and staring at him disbelievingly.

Their friends never quite hit it off that night, but after a couple of tequilas, Jake and Kristen were enamored.

Curbed enthusiasm: Neither Kristen nor Jake were particularly keen to meet one another

Let's just get this over with: Kristen and Jake were initially frosty until a couple of tequilas loosened them up

As the trailer moves on to movie-trailer Kristen talking on the phone about her meeting with Jake, Kristen can be seen laughing and Jake is beginning to look relieved and somewhat pleased with himself.

'Next year, you'll find that to get comfortable with someone, you have to first get uncomfortable,' intones the voice-over.

The trailer covers the relationship's ups and downs, from hoping for a best friend's approval and getting a bit tipsy in the attempt (cue real-Kristen burying her face in Jake's arm) to their argument about Jake's constant lateness.

Smitten: Movie-trailer Kristen tells a friend she is 'like, so enamored' of Jake while the real Kristen cracks up

Sorry not sorry: The couple has a fight about Jake's lateness but his apology leaves a lot to be desired - Kirsten in the movie theater seems to remember it well

'This is a story about letting go of the petty wants and holding on to the deep connection,' says the voice-over as a montage of Jake-and-Kristen couple moments plays out.

Finally, after a confession to a friend that he realized Kristen was 'the one' when she bought him a blender for Christmas - even though he hadn't told anyone how much he wanted one because he was embarrassed - Jake gets down to business.

Uncanny: The actress playing Kristen has definitely got her reactions down-pat as she is proposed to by movie-trailer Jake

Hollywood moment: Jake proposes to Kristen as cinema patrons watch on

Engaged: The real life couple of this 'perfectly imperfect' love story

'For this perfectly imperfect love story to happen, it all depends on one thing, and one thing only,' says the voiceover as movie-trailer Jake gets down on one knee.

In the cinema, Jake takes Kristen's hands and does the same.

She responds with a muffled, 'Duh!' and they kiss and hug ecstatically.

Looks like this love story had a Hollywood ending.
