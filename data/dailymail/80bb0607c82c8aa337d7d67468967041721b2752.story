Despite his playboy persona, Prince Harry has made no secret of his desire to settle down if he could find the the 'right person' who was 'willing to take on the job'.

Now it seems he has found 'The One' in the form of  Cressida Bonas, a member of the so called  BBB Crew - Blue-Bloods And Blonde - who he has been dating since last year.

Despite being coy when quizzed about his love life while in Afghanistan at the end of last year, the Prince made no secret of his affection for the 24 year old beauty this week as they were pictured embracing on the slopes during a ski holiday with his uncle Prince Andrew and family.

Now the pair are set to attend the wedding of Cressida's half-sister, Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, who is marrying Sir Richard Branson's businessman son Sam in South Africa next week.

A source told today's Sun that the Prince is keen to accompany Cressida to the wedding because: 'Harry and Cressie are at
the exciting stage of a relationship where they just want to spend as 
much time together as possible.'

As any woman in a fledgling 
relationship will know, a beau agreeing to attend a family wedding with 
you is a promising sign of commitment.

So while Harry, 28, may be a long way
from popping the question himself, his recent behaviour suggests he's 
now prepared for Cressida to go from being his casual date to filling 
the role of royal girlfriend.

Indeed, before his trip to 
Afghanistan, friends of privately-educated Cressida had joked that she 
was his 'girlfriend-in-waiting'.

Given the intense press interest in 
royal love lives and the impact Harry has seen it have on the life of 
his late mother Princess Diana, and more recently the Duchess of 
Cambridge, it's no surprise he has wanted to shield Cressida from the 
public gaze for as long as possible.

The fact his long-term relationship 
with Chelsy Davy broke down because she wasn't prepared for a life in 
the global spotlight could have also played on his mind.

But according to the Evening 
Standard's royal correspondent, Robert Jobson, Harry's public display of
affection with Cressida this week was 'a clear message of intent' from 
the media savvy prince. That message being, 'she's my girl, and I don't 
care who knows.'

While being the subject of global media attention is new to Cressida, mingling with the rich, famous and royal, is not.

She is friends with both Princess 
Beatrice and Eugenie, joining the former in the world record attempt to 
complete the London Marathon in a human caterpillar in 2010, while the 
latter is said to have introduced her to Harry.

She is the daughter of renowned Sixties It girl Lady Mary Gaye Curzon (whose father was the 6th Earl Howe) and Old Harrovian Jeffrey Bonas (her mother's third husband) owns a fabric company
called MacCulloch & Wallis.

Her parents have racked up six 
marriages between them so Cressida has a number of half brothers and 
sisters including soon-to-be a Branson, Isabella, who was once admired 
by Prince William, and Gabriella Wilde, a model for Burberry.

Following her parent's separation, Cressida continued to enjoy a privileged upbringing as her bohemian mother then married multi-millionaire Christopher Shaw.

Cressida attended £30,000-a-year Stowe School in Buckingham where she showed a flair for acting as well as sport.

She was said to be one of the most popular girls at the sixth form because of her zest for fun and free spirit.

‘It was non-stop laughter and 
mischief for two years,’ her school friend told the Daily Mail last 
year. ‘Our group of girls were all quite different and arty, which is 
more Cress.’

She then attended Leeds University where she studied for a degree in dance and had another boyfriend with royal connections - Harry 
Wentworth-Stanley – whose stepfather, George Milford Haven, is a cousin 
of the Queen.

Dancing is the blonde's passion and she now studies contemporary dance at The Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in Greenwich.

In the spotlight: The world's media will now be watching Cressida

She is said to dislike the London 
Sloane party scene usually popular with the upper classes and instead 
prefers letting her hair down at music festivals.

Her friends say, 'when not in the studio she's out on the tennis court or up a mountain with her skis.'

She's also a fan of travelling, 
having spent time after university working in Australia, which would 
suit Prince Harry when he undertakes royal tours.

He lamented travelling solo last year
to Jamaica for the Queen's Jubilee saying: 'I've always said that it’d 
probably be easier as a couple. I don’t have anyone. I wasn’t allowed to
bring anybody with me.

Perhaps that won't be the case for much longer now things are getting more serious with Cressida.
