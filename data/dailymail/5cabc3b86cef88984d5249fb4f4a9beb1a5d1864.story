She was named as Playboy Playmate of the Year back in 2000.

But the latest project model Mirja du Mont has taken on is far removed from her earlier career work.

In ZDF's Auf der Flucht - das Experiment, du Mont will make a perilous journey from Germany to Africa via Italy - the reverse of an asylum seeker's route to the country.

She is part of a group of fellow 'B-list celebrities' who will have no money, no mobile phone, no rights (and no high heels) as they take on an emotional and fraught challenge.

The model is married to Eyes Wide Shut actor Sky du Mont and has three children.

Harsh reality really hits home when she is thrust into a 13,000-strong refugee camp in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
