A mystery severed hand and fresh evidence from a nurse has raised suspicions of a political cover-up over Germany's deadliest post-war terrorist attack, it emerged today.

Thirteen people were killed and more than 200 injured when a huge bomb ripped through the crowd at Munich's world-famous Oktoberfest in 1980.

Police quickly concluded the explosives were planted by a lone-wolf extremist, the 21-year-old neo-Nazi Gundolf Koehler who died in the attack.

But late last year, German prosecutors reopened the investigation after growing concerns that there may have been a cover-up among the political elite.

Now new evidence has emerged surrounding a severed hand which was found at the scene of the bombing that night. 

Fresh evidence surrounding a mystery severed hand has raised suspicions of a political cover-up over the 1980 Oktoberfest bombing (above) which killed 13 people and injured more than 200 others 

Police ruled the hand could only have belonged to Koehler, even though its fingerprints were never found in the geology student's car he drove the scene, only at his flat.

A nurse has now spoken for the time about treating a young man whose lower arm was missing in the aftermath of the bombing, suggesting Koehler may have had an accomplice.

The unnamed medic told Germany's ARD television channel last night that the arm had been injured in the explosion and had to be amputated, according to the Independent.

She said: 'He wouldn't say how he got hurt - he was proud of it. I went into his room and he was smiling all over.'

She added that he was only ever visited by 'groups of men' and left discharged himself having his stitches out.

Ulrich Chaussy, the journalist behind the ARD documentary, claims to have evidence that police were forced to eliminate any suggestion of a group attack from the inquiry by then Bavarian Prime Minister Franz Josef Strauss, who was bidding to become German Chancellor at the time.

Mr Chaussy claims to have proof that Mr Strauss feared politically damaging accusations that he had failed to tackle a major right-wing extremist group who had initially been implicated in the attack.

As a result, Mr Strauss - who died in 1988 -  instructed investigators to pin the bombing on Koehler, Mr Chaussy alleges.

Six members of the neo-Nazi paramilitary group called the Hoffmann Military Sports Group were briefly detained over the atrocity but never charged. 

Mr Chaussy told Bild newspaper: 'As the evidence mounts, the lone attacker theory is crumbling.' 

The evidence adds further weight to previous claims that unknown co-conspirators may have worked alongside Koehler which prompted prosecutors to reopen the investigation in December. 

Chief prosecutor Harald Range said the investigation would 'pursue all leads... anew and comprehensively' adding: 'There is no statute of limitations on murder.

Detonated in a bin by one of the festival's exit points at the height of the Friday night rush, the improvised explosive was made from a hand grenade packed with nails.

Three covered bodies after the bomb attack on the popular German beer festival. Fresh evidence from a new witness may suggest that Koehler had co-conspirators who helped him with the attack 

Koehler, described by German media at the time as a loner and a gun nut, was known to be a supporter of the neo-Nazi paramilitary group called the Hoffmann Military Sports Group.

The extreme right-wing militia named after its leader Karl Heinz-Hoffman, was banned by the German government. 

But while the original investigation said their had been indications that others had been involved, prosecutors could find no conclusive evidence to prove this before it was shut down in 1982. 

Nonetheless, many victims, local politicians and lawyers have questioned the 'lone attacker' theory. 

Among them was lawyer, Werner Dietrich who told The New York Times last year that the case was reopened because of a call he had received from the new witness in September. 

Declining to name her, he told the paper that just hours after the bombing she found fliers lauding Koehler as a 'hero of the right' in a home where she was teaching in Silesia, a region of central Europe located mostly in Poland. 

She had told police at the time but they had not followed up her claims, he said, adding that he had heard a similar story from three or four men who were among the injured. 

Those witnesses said they had seen Koehler arguing with other people before the bomb went off.

The bombing was the worst terrorist act attributed to the right wing in Germany after 1945.

However, throughout the 1970s and 1980s Germany saw several far-left terrorist attacks including the murder of prominent public figures and hijackings.
