Furious family members today continued to rally around alleged criminal Nicolas Sarkozy – but there has not been a word from his wife Carla Bruni.

The 46-year-old former supermodel has not been seen since the former President of France was arrested and charged with a range of corruption allegations on Wednesday.

It follows reports that Mr Sarkozy, 59, and his third wife, who is now a pop singer, have been experiencing problems in their marriage. Since being released from police custody following 15 hours of questioning, Mr Sarkozy has been out in public with his grown up sons, including visiting a Paris restaurant on Wednesday night.

Mr Sarkozy smiled and posed for photographs with supporters after appearing in a recorded TV broadcast in which he accused judges of trying to ‘destroy’ his reputation. 

But the normally massively high-profile Carla was nowhere to be seen. Instead it was left to her mother, Marisa Bruni Tedeschi, and his son, Louis, to speak up for the diminutive politician.

Ms Bruni Tedeschi said judges had ‘cut the legs’ off Mr Sarkozy, adding: ‘The real scandal is the theatrical flourish – the means and the moment chosen to bring the accusations against Nicolas.’ She added: ‘Strange that the enquiry is happening now – it’s the moment chosen which suggests a vendetta…Those who are close to him are scandalised.’

His 17-year-old son, Louis, meanwhile, tweeted: 'They want to sabotage my father's comeback while France is in the s***.' 

According to a front page story in the latest edition of the glossy ‘Ici Paris’ (Here, Paris) magazine the former president and his one-time first lady are separating.

‘Carla and Nicolas: the end of a great story’ reads the splash headline, accompanied by gloomy looking pictures of the couple. Mr Sarkozy has accused judges of ‘humiliating me’ after being charged with 'active corruption', 'influence peddling', and 'violating the professional secrecy of an active judicial enquiry'.

Now facing up to 10 years in prison and a £400,000 fine, he said France should not have to put up with left-wing judges who wanted to scupper his possible return to power.

The Paris home Sarkozy shares with Ms Bruni was first raided by anti-corruption officers in 2012, within days of him losing that year’s presidential election to the Socialist Francois Hollande. There has been a steady stream of corruption allegations aimed at Sarkozy ever since, with Sarkozy’s lawyer, Thierry Herzog, and Azibert Gilbert, a judge implicated in the corruption case, also charged.

Sarkozy, who was president for five years from 2007, is suspected of having tried to pervert the course of justice through his contacts in the judiciary He is said to have offered an attractive job in Monaco to Judge Azibert in return for inside information about the progress of the so-called Bettencourt affair.

This was a case in which Sarkozy was accused of accepting millions in illegal cash from Liliane Bettencourt, the l’Oreal heiress and France’s richest woman, towards his election campaign in 2007. Investigators also believe Sarkozy was illegally tipped off that his phone was being tapped as part of investigations into another matter, the so-called Gaddafi Affair.

This is said to have involved Sarkozy receiving millions more from the late Colonel Gaddafi – the former Libyan leader. Sarkozy, who was immune from prosecution while in office, insists that he is innocent of any wrong-doing.
