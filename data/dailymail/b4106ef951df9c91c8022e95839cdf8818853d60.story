A former 'Melrose Place' actress has been sentenced to three years' prison after she drunkenly plowed her SUV into another car in New Jersey, killing a married mother-of-two.

Victim Helene Seeman's husband Fred yelled, 'What a travesty!' at the judge after today's sentencing, and he and his son stormed out of the courtroom in tears.

Amy Locane-Bovenizer faced up to 10 years in prison after a jury in November convicted her of vehicular homicide in the 2010 death of 60-year-old Seeman in Montgomery Township.

The judge lowered the maximum sentence citing the hardship on Locane-Bovenizer's two children, one of whom has a medical disability and the other a mental disability.

Fred Seeman cried out 'God I loved her so much' as he talked about his wife during the sentencing hearing, while Helene Seeman's mother Marcia Zucker held up a photo of her late daughter in the courtroom.

The woman's son Ford Seeman wept into one of his mother's dresses, which he wore around his neck in the court.

Locane-Bovenizer broke down as the judge read out the sentence in the Sommerville, New Jersey, court and apologized to the Seeman's family.

The actress' blood-alcohol level was nearly three times the legal limit when the crash occurred as Seeman's husband turned into their driveway.

In November, a jury acquitted Locane-Bovenizer of the more serious charge of aggravated manslaughter, in the deadly crash that left Fred Seeman severely injured.

Somerset County prosecutors said the crash occurred on a dark two-lane road in Montgomery Township in 2010. The actress told emergency personnel in the ambulance that she had downed four glasses of wine and a beer.

She also was convicted of assault by 
auto and originally faces three to five years in prison on that count. 
Her bail was revoked after the verdict and she has been in jail since 
November.

The mother-of-two is married to liquor store owner Mark Bovenizer.

Locane-Bovenizer appeared in 13 episodes of Melrose Place in the role of Sandy Louise Harling and in movies including Cry-Baby opposite Johnny Depp, School Ties and Secretary.

During
court hearings last summer, a 
police testified that the actress was found 'giggling' and appearing 
'happy' as she sat in a drainage ditch following the collision in June 
of 2010.

A short time 
later, the actress asked the officer and emergency medical personnel why
they were 'making such a big deal' about applying a neck brace and 
putting her in an ambulance, Montgomery police officer William Wilkes 
told the court.

'She
said we were being overly dramatic,' said Officer Wilkes. 'I said, "The
reason I'm making such a big deal is because you were just in a severe 
two-car collision."'

'After they had taken a blood sample,
at some point she said, "Am I pregnant or am I just drunk?"' Officer 
Wilkes told the court.

He 
also recalled that, in the hours following the crash, Locane-Bovenizer 
urinated in her hospital bed, rambled incoherently and at times seemed 
unaware of what had occurred.

Officer
Wilkes was the second officer to arrive at the crash scene after the 
emergency call was made at 9.16pm where he found Locane-Bovenizer 
sitting upright in the nearby ditch.

'Her
clothes were a little messed up, dirty,' he recalled to the court. 'Her
eyes were bloodshot and watery, her speech was a little slurred.'

He added that the actress was 'happy, 
giggling, laughing' when he found her and alleged that during the 
ambulance ride she told emergency personnel that she had consumed four 
glasses of wine and a beer.

In
the hospital emergency room, he told the court that Locane-Bovenizer 
asked several times what had happened to her sport utility vehicle.

Prompted: An attorney for the actress, pictured 
left as Sandy in Melrose Place, argued her having been chased by another
driver causing her to speed and crash into the Seemans' vehicle

When
Officer Wilkes answered her, he said, 'She kind of acknowledged it and a
couple minutes later it would be like that conversation never happened,
almost.'

Locane-Bovenizer eventually asked, 'I'm sorry, am I getting a DWI?' Officer Wilkes added.

In October, Seeman's husband Fred, who survived the crash, told jurors that he watched his wife die as he gave emotional testimony in court.

Seeman said that it was like getting hit by a bomb when his car was struck
by an SUV driven by Locane-Bovenizer on June 27, 2010.

He tearfully told jurors how he heard gurgling noises from his wife Helene.

The defense claimed the actress was distracted by another driver who was 
chasing her after she rear-ended their vehicle and Seeman turned in front of her.

The woman, identified in 
court as Maureen Ruckelshaus, honked her horn and flashed her lights, 
causing Locane-Bovenizer to drive nearly 20 mph over the speed limit on 
narrow country roads.

The chase ended when the actress slammed 
into the Seemans' vehicle as it pulled into a driveway.

The couple had 
been returning from dinner with friends at a restaurant 10 minutes from home.

Seeman, a 62-year-old Manhattan real estate attorney, suffered lung and rib injuries in the crash.

He told the court that 2010 had been a
'last glorious year' for the family and that he and his wife, an art 
adviser, had recently watched their youngest son graduate from high 
school, according to nj.com.

Somerset 
County Assistant Prosecutor Matthew Murphy said at the opening of the trial on October 4 that Locane-Bovenizer had 
eight to 10 drinks at two gatherings before the accident.

'Death was probable, not merely possible,' Murphy told jurors. 'These circumstances were so extreme that death was probable.'
