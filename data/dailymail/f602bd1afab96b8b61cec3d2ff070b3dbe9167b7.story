A woman has lost 10 stone after being humiliated on her birthday by a DJ who shouted out 'Happy 21st birthday – and congratulations on hitting 21 stone.'

But Gemma Howard, who actually weighed 25 stone, got the last laugh as she returned to the same club on her 30th birthday weighing 14st 10lbs.

After spending almost a decade smarting from the cruel jibe, Gemma, 32, from Luton, Beds, decided to lose 10 stone in the year before she turned 30.  

Gemma Howard, 32, from Luton, weighed 25 stone when she turned 21 (left). She celebrated her birthday local nightclub where the DJ wished her happy birthday but also announced she had hit 21 stone. She vowed to lose 10 stone before returning. Gemma has since lost 12 stone (right)

When Gemma approached the DJ, he did not recognise her – so she told him who she was.

He gave her a bottle of champagne and apologised – admitting to the crowd what he had done.

And he confessed she now weighed less than him.

Recounting the original incident, Gemma, 32, of Luton, Beds, told how excited she was about her 21st in March, 2003.

She said: 'We decided to celebrate at Flame nightclub in town. 

'I was wearing a black mesh top and tiara.

'I wasn't a size 10 but I still thought I scrubbed up pretty well.

'The reality? I was 25 stone and bulging out of my outfit. I guess I was in denial.'

Growing up, Gemma ate all the wrong things - she loved fast food and big family meals. 

At school, the boys in her class would save up their lunches and throw sandwiches at her outside the school gates. 

Gemma would pretend she didn't care, but would go home and comfort eat to feel better.  

By the time she got to college, she was 23 stone.

She said: 'I'd pretend to be bubbly and confident, but deep down I think I knew I was faking it. 

'I spent a lot of time in gay clubs and bars - mainly because I wouldn't get rejected there! 

'So for my 21st birthday we went to one, Flame. I'd been before and always had fun.

'When we arrived, my mate Ian bought a bottle of champagne and told the drag act DJ, Nick, it was my birthday. 

'Nick then announced, "Happy 21st birthday Gemma," while my friends cheered and raised their glasses.

'But then he laughed and said, "And congratulations for turning 21 stone!"

'People turned to stare, the humiliation was too much and I burst into tears, as my friends bundled me into the toilet to calm me down.'

Gemma tried to put on a brave face but her night was completely ruined. 

After that she avoided going back to that nightclub as she couldn't face seeing the DJ again. 

Gemma spent a lot of her twenties in other gay clubs though, feeling too self conscious to go out anywhere else. 

And when it came to boyfriends, she never felt good enough for anybody.

She said: 'Those horrible words, "Congratulations for turning 21 stone" were always ringing in my ears. 

'I tried dieting but I'd lose five stone then put it all back on - the idea of being fat when I turned 30 filled me with dread though. 

'I was determined to have a better time celebrating than at my 21st.'

So in September 2011, Gemma started the Cambridge Weight Plan which involves shakes, soups and bars. 

She was determined to lose 10 stone in a year - before her 30th.

Then her friend Ian suggested they celebrate it at that same nightclub - Flame.

She said: 'Even nine years on, the memory of that night hadn't got any less painful. 

'I told Ian I didn't think I could go, but then the more I thought about it, the more I realised it could be the perfect motivation - every time I craved a big packet of crisps, I thought of my humiliating 21st. 

'I told all my mates who'd been there with me nine years earlier, and my new mates were all filled in on the story.'

By March 2012, Gemma weighed 14st 10lbs - after losing more than 10 stone. 

Before her birthday night out at Flame, she treated herself to a new short red dress and had a spray tan.

She said: 'When I walked into that club, I had my head held high. 

'The same DJ was spinning the decks. Ian asked him to wish me happy birthday and pointed in my direction, "'Happy 30th Gemma," he announced, ushering me up onto the stage. 

'I was full of confidence as I strutted over. He said he hardly recognised me, and gave me a bottle of champagne.

'Then he announced to the room, "Nine years ago I congratulated Gemma on being 21 stone, now she weighs less than me! You look amazing - congratulations and happy birthday!"

'It meant a lot to me and I had a fantastic night.

'Since then I've lost another two stone and I'm still shedding the pounds. 

'That humiliating experience may have ruined my 21st birthday, but it made my 30th my best yet.'
