With viewing figures of almost 
10 million every week, ITV's 
charming period drama Downton Abbey is in no doubt.

But
it appears a weekly television fix is not enough for one Downton fan who is so fixated with the upstairs/downstairs lives of
the 1920s characters that he has recreated the British Edwardian drama out of thousands of Lego bricks.

The Earl and Countess of Grantham, Bates the valet, Branson, Matthew, Carson the butler, Mary, Sybil and the imposing Dowager are all brought to life in brick form in his one-of-a-kind Lego set.

Fanatic: A devoted Downton Abbey fan has recreated the British Edwardian drama out of thousands of Lego bricks. He gave his creation, which took fifteen hours to design, to his girlfriend for Christmas

The fictional post-Edwardian Yorkshire country estate, the aristocratic Crawley family and their servants have been pain-stakingly built out of plastic pieces.

This is the first Lego set made including both the famous abbey and its characters and was built by a fan of the British drama from the U.S..

Guess who? The Earl and Countess of Grantham, Bates the valet, Branson, Matthew, Carson the butler, Mary, Sybil and the imposing Dowager are all brought to life in the charming Lego set

Spot the difference: This Lego character depicts Carson the butler, as played by Jim Carter (R)

Seeing double? This brown suit clad Lego man is Allen Leech's character, Tom Branson

The abbey was designed on a digital designer, and is based on ground and aerial photos of the real Highclere Castle where Downton is filmed, and old floor plans of the building found online.

This unique Lego set was created by Eric Stevens, 23, from Rochester, New York as a Christmas present for his girlfriend.

Eric said: 'I looked to see if anyone had created Downton Abbey Lego whilst watching last year.

Intricate: The designs took fifteen hours of hard labour, this one is Michelle Dockery's character, Lady Mary Crawley

Inspiration: Eric used photographs of the cast to create designs, such as this one of Dowager Countess Grantham, as played by Maggie Smith

One of a kind: This is the first Lego set made including both the famous abbey and its characters - such as Matthew Crawley, played by Dan Stevens

'I couldn't find any other ones, so I decided to build it myself as a gift fro my girlfriend, who also loves the show.

'The design took about 15 hours, altogether, and about four hours to actually put it together.

'I think the project really captures the essence of Highclere, Downton and the brilliant period characters.

'All of the characters are Lego-designed parts, rather than custom printed pieces.

'The apron, for Sybil's nurse outfit, I made myself.'

DIY: Eric couldn't find anything like this on the market so decided to create it himself. Here is Thomas, played by Rob James-Collier

Snap! Actor Brendan Coyle as Bates has been recreated in Lego form

Lookalike? The pieces, like Robert Crawley's version, took four hours to piece together
