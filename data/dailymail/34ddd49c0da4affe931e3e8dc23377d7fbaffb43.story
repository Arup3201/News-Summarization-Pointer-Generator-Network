At one point a man could be seen coweing on the ground as a kick was delivered to his chest.

Police quickly ran to the scene and arrested  three Chargers fans and a Broncos fan.

It is not clear if anyone in custody was hospitalized after the fight.

Police are now investigating the incident to determine who instigated the fight.

The person who posted the video online wrote: 'A bronco fan decided to run through the charger fans in San Diego national city like a dumba**.'

During the commotton a photojournalist with a San Diego TV station was nipped by a police dog during the commotion.

He was treated for minor injuries and continued to take video of the rally.

After the unrest the event continued.

Peyton Manning welcomed Wes Welker 
back into the lineup with a touchdown toss and the Denver Broncos 
narrowly avoided a repeat of their playoff slip from last year, 
advancing to the AFC championship game with a 24-17 win over the San 
Diego Chargers on Sunday.

The
 Broncos (14-3) controlled the game for 3Â½ quarters before Philip Rivers
 capitalized on an injury to cornerback Chris Harris Jr. to stage a 
comeback reminiscent of Baltimore's shocking win at Denver exactly a 
year earlier.

This time, 
however, Manning rescued the Broncos from the brink of another crushing 
collapse and sent them into the title game for the first time in eight 
seasons.

Grasp: Denver's Demaryius Thomas catches a touchdown pass in the first quarter

Safe hands: Wes Welker doubles Denver's lead with another touchdown in the second quarter

They'll host the New England Patriots (13-4) on Sunday. Get ready for Brady vs. Manning once more.

In
 the most recent matchup of QBs with Hall of Fame credentials, Tom Brady
 and the Patriots rallied past Manning and the visiting Broncos 34-31 in
 overtime on Nov. 24.

'It's 
the Broncos versus the Patriots and certainly Tom and I have played 
against each other a lot,' Manning said after beating San Diego. 'But 
when you get to the AFC championship, it's about two good teams that 
have been through a lot to get there.'

Manning,
 in the playoffs for a record 13 seasons as a quarterback, ended a 
personal three-game postseason skid in winning for the first time since 
leading Indianapolis over the Jets 30-17 in the AFC championship game on
 Jan. 24, 2010.

Manning 
completed 25 of 36 passes for 230 yards and two TDs, numbers that 
weren't quite up to the standards he set during a record-breaking 
regular season when he established new benchmarks with 55 TD throws and 
5,447 yards through the air.

But
 it was windy and the Broncos were intent on establishing the run and 
controlling the clock after San Diego had Manning and his high octane 
offense cooling their cleats on the sideline for more than 38 minutes in
 both of their meetings during the regular season.

After
 gaining just 18 yards on the ground against San Diego last month, the 
Broncos ran for 133 yards, including 82 by Knowshon Moreno, whose 3-yard
 TD run put them ahead 24-7 with 8:12 left.

After that, things got interesting.

The
 Chargers got close, but Manning completed a pair of key third-down 
passes in the final minutes to prevent San Diego from getting a final 
chance.
