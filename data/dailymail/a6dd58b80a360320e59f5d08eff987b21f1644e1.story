Ander Herrera appears to be settling in nicely at Manchester United after he was pictured with team-mate Anderson at a restaurant.

The Spaniard posted the picture to his Instagram account with the pair all smiles in what could be a potential midfield combination used by new boss Louis van Gaal next season.

Hererra was the Dutchman's first signing at the club in a £28million deal from Spanish outfit Athletic Bilbao in June.

It is not the first time that the 24-year-old has shown that he is getting used to his new surroundings after he tweeted a picture of himself in Manchester's city centre earlier this month accompanied with the message: 'Enjoying my day off - getting to know my new home Manchester.'

The midfielder has already joined up with his new team-mates for pre-season training as the Red Devils look to return to the summit of the Premier League after a underwhelming season where they finished seventh.

Herrera signed for Bilbao in 2011, and went on to score 11 goals in 128 appearances for the club in all competitions.

He
 become the third young Spaniard to move to Old Trafford in recent 
years, following goalkeeper David de Gea and midfielder Juan Mata.
