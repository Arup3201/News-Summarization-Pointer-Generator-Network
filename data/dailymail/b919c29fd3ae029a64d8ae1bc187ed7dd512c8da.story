The National Federation of the Blind is suing app-based ride-sharing service Uber alleging that it discriminates against passengers using guide dogs.

The civil rights lawsuit, filed in federal court in San Francisco on Tuesday, claims that some Uber drivers have refused to give rides to blind people with service dogs and that others have mishandled the dogs or harassed their owners.

The lawsuit was filed by the organisation’s California affiliate and Michael Hingson, a blind author and public speaker who lives in Victorville in San Bernardino County.

'Our right to independent travel is unjustly jeopardized when Uber drivers refuse to transport or harass blind customers due to the presence of their service animals,’ said Mary Willows, president of the National Federation of the Blind of California.

The group said it is aware of more than 30 times blind customers who have been denied rides in violation of the American with Disabilities Act and California state law, reports CBS.

As a result, blind passengers 'face the degrading experience of being denied a basic service that is available to all other paying customers,' the complaint said.

In one instance a California UberX driver put a service dog in the trunk and refused to pull over when the blind passenger realized where the animal was.

The lawsuit was filed by the organisation’s California affiliate and Michael Hingson, right, a blind author and public speaker who lives in Victorville in San Bernardino County.

On another occasion a passenger was trying to explain that his dog was not a pet but a service animal when the driver allegedly cursed at him and accelerated abruptly, nearly injuring the dog and striking the passenger’s friend, who is also blind, with an open car door.

Other cases include drivers allegedly abandoned blind travelers in extreme weather and charging cancellation fees after denying them rides.

The lawsuit says the federation and Hingson have tried to negotiate with Uber to resolve their claims without a lawsuit, but were unable to do so.

It asks for an injunction requiring Uber to take steps to ensure that its drivers don’t illegally refuse to transport blind people with service dogs.

Uber has issued a statement saying it had not yet been officially notified of the lawsuit, but noting that its policy is to terminate the use of drivers who refuse to transport service animals.

‘The Uber app is built to expand access to transportation options for all, including users with visual impairments and other disabilities,’ the statement said.

‘It is Uber’s policy that any driver partner that refuses to transport a service animal will be deactivated from the Uber platform,’ the company said.

Based in San Francisco, Uber is a transportation network service that uses a smartphone application to connect passengers with drivers who are willing to give them rides for pay.
