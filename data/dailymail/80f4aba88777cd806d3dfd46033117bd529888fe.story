A Seattle couple who met via their shared love of photo sharing app Instagram have announced their engagement - two years after their first real life date. 

Newly-engaged photographers Bethany Olson and Cory Staudacher first 'met' via Instagram in 2011, when a friend of Bethany's posted a picture of Cory, prompting her to follow his account. 

'I thought, dang this guy is talented and cute,' she confessed to BRIDES magazine. 'So I started following his work!'

It didn't take long for the pair to strike up an online relationship, which quickly developed from a simple 'like' on an Instagram photo to lengthy chats via Facebook and Twitter.

And after months of online messages, texts and phone calls, the couple, who lived less than one hour away from one another, arranged their first real life meeting.

'In summer of 2012, I started working at a Vitamin Water stand for a huge music festival in Seattle,' Bethany said. 

'As I was pouring some Vitamin Water into cups and handing it to people who I wasn’t looking at, I heard this "Hello Bethany!" I looked up and it was Cory, and I immediately turned bright red and became flustered.'

Despite the initial shock,Cory and Bethany quickly bonded as well in real life as they had online and just a few weeks later, the pair enjoyed their first 'official' date on September 12 at the scenic La Push beach, just a few hours outside of Seattle.

'After that date, there was something about him that I knew was special,' Bethany admitted. 'I couldn’t pinpoint it, but after two weeks of dating I realized I wanted to marry him! It’s so crazy to think about that now.' 

She said yes! Cory announced the couple's engagement on his Instagram account, alongside this picture of his new bride-to-be

The couple never looked back - and have continued to share every step of their blossoming relationship with their Instagram followers, including their recent engagement, which Cory ensured was perfect down to every last detail, including a romantic picnic on the beach featuring all of Bethany's favourite foods.

'Once we got to the beach, Cory hiked down this basket full of cute stuff; cheese, crackers, wine, and chocolate (my favorite!),' the future Mrs Staudacher revealed. '...I was thinking to myself "I wonder if he’s going to propose..."'

Unsurprisingly, it didn't take long for Cory to announce the duo's happy news on Instagram, with a heartwarming message posted alongside a photo of his new bride-to-be.
