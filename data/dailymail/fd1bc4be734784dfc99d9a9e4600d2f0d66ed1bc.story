The Drudge Report was first to report Bartiromo's move.

'After twenty great years of having a front row seat to some of the most important economic stories in the world, it's hard to sum up the gratitude and appreciation I have for the team that helped make it happen,' Bartiromo said in a statement.

'I am incredibly proud of what we have been able to accomplish.'

Her representative did not immediately respond when asked to comment on reports that she's going to Fox Business.

Bartiromo joined CNBC in 1993 after five years as a producer and assignment editor with CNN Business News.

She was the first journalist to report live from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

At CNBC, she pioneered daily live reporting from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and won an Emmy Award for a documentary on Google.

Bartiromo anchors CNBC's 'Closing Bell with Maria Bartiromo' and the syndicated 'On the Money with Maria Bartiromo.'
