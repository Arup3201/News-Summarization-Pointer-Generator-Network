A birthday party hosted by the parliamentary aide to Home Secretary Theresa May over the weekend was so loud the police had to attend - twice.

Tory MP George Hollingbery, 50, was warned by officers to turn the noise down when they were called to what neighbours described as his 'mini festival' at a village in Hampshire.

Disgruntled residents living in the village said they could not sleep as loud music boomed until 2.30am on Saturday night.

MP George Hollingbery threw a party over the weekend but police were called when residents complaned

They said the night was 'horrendous' and claimed they could hear the songs over their televisions.

The lavish private party - which came complete with stylish teepees and 'glamping' - was to celebrate his daughter Jessica's s 21st and a joint 50th birthday bash for himself and his wife.

A live band, DJs and several hundred guests attended the party on the grounds of Mr Hollingbery's country house. 

But officers visited his home at 11.30pm over complaints about bright lights and again an hour later to tell him to turn the music down.

The band played until 1.30am while other music continued.

Mr Hollingbery, MP for Meon Valley, received a final message from Hampshire Constabulary at 1.43am requesting he turn the noise down.

One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'It was totally horrendous.

The Meon Valley Tory MP has since apologised for causing a noise disturbance when he threw the  party 

'It didn't matter whether we had double glazing, earplugs or whether we dragged a mattress to the other side of the house.

'Even playing classical music on a radio to drown it out would not have worked - we could not get to sleep until about half past two.

'It's not music then, it's an aural assault. It was an invasion of your privacy and an invasion of your own mental space.'

The party was jointly for Mr Hollingbery and his wife's 50th birthdays and daughter Jessica's 21st (pictured)

Another resident dubbed the party as 'more like a mini festival'.

The MP, private parliamentary secretary to Ms May, has previously spoken out over noise pollution in his constituency.

In an article for parish magazines in April, he said that noise from large groups of bikers on county roads was an issue.

He said: 'It is a real problem, particularly at weekends and on summer evenings when the noise can be continuous for residents.'

In a statement, Mr Hollingbery said he was 'very sorry' for the disruption.

He said: 'I'm very sorry that some residents were upset and inconvenienced by noise from a private party I held at my house on Saturday.

'It was my daughter's 21st and myself and my wife's 50th joint birthday celebration and comprised of several hundred guests and a band and DJs.

'It appears that the music was too loud on this occasion and when we realised it was an issue the sound was turned down and the band stopped playing at just after 1.30am.

'I also took measures to limit noise from other parts of the party.

'The police did attend the party twice: once at around 11.30pm after a call to investigate light from the party and once about noise about an hour later.

'On the second occasion an officer spoke to my wife and we offered to turn the sound down and that was done.

'An officer left a voice message officially asking us to turn the noise down and that was received at 1.43am.

'By this point the band, which was the main source of the noise, had stopped playing.

'Music was playing in other areas but this was also kept very low and we received no further visits and no further telephone calls from the police after 1.43am.

'Over the years, we have held quite a few parties at my house - the vast majority of them for charity - and this is the first time there has been a problem with noise.

'I truly understand it was clearly unpleasant for some of our neighbours and I very much hope they will accept my sincere apologies.'

Mr Hollingbery said the party was for friends and family and that Ms May did not attend.

He was elected at the 2010 general election as the Member of Parliament for Meon Valley.

He offered no comment when asked  how the incident reflects on his position in the Home Office.
