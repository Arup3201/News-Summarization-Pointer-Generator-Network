Maxim magazine has provoked outrage after it named ex-murder suspect Amanda Knox one of 2012’s sexiest women.

The popular men's magazine included the American student in its 'Hot 100' countdown alongside the most beautiful celebrities in the world, including pop star Katy Perry and actress Megan Fox.

Knox, 24, spent four years in jail after being found guilty of killing British student Meredith Kercher in November 2007, but she was cleared last October.

Appropriate? The attractive American was voted one of the most beautiful women of 2012 after drawing huge levels of attention for her looks during her  incarceration

Popular imagination: The men's magazine draws attention to its controversial choice with an an introduction that refers to 'sexy movie stars and murder suspects'

Her high-profile trial and time behind bars was characterised by glamorous photos of the pretty ex student and endless comment on her appearance as well as her case.

A light-hearted caption under the picture of her reads: 'Foxy Knoxy's murder rap was overturned after she spent four years in a hardcore Italian prison.

'We're guessing she hasn't hit the Olive Garden [a popular Italian food chain] since coming back.'

The list was introduced with the flippant words: 'From movie stars to murder suspects to a cartoon, here are the sexy results.'

Twitter users attacked the controversial move, with one tweeting: 'AMANDA KNOX Y'ALL ... Maxim Hot 100 list is once again criminally foolish.'

Another added: 'Yeah...nothing sexier than being accused of killing your roommate while studying abroad!'

The furore has eclipsed arguments over rival magazine FHM's 'sexiest women' list, which caused heated debate when X-Factor judge Tulisa was named number one shortly after her sex-tape scandal.

Israeli model Bar Rafaeli, Leonardo Di Caprio's ex, topped Maxim's list, while Knox came in at 92, in between West Wing star Claire Coffee and U.S. TV personality La La Anthony.

The list in the U.S. edition of Maxim was compiled from readers' votes, with the magazine writing: 'Our fellow Americans: As we're reminded every four years, democracy is the cornerstone upon which our great land is built.

'That's why this year, for the first time in Hot 100 history, we let you, the readers of Maxim, weigh in on who should comprise the definitive list of the world's most beautiful women.

'From movie stars to murder suspects to a cartoon, here are the sexy results. God bless America!'

Model and Transformers star Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Underworld actress Kate Beckinsale made 11 and 12.

Pippa Middleton also made the list at 81, coming in well behind Harry Potter star Emma Watson at 21.

Comedian Stephen Colbert was ranked at 69, becoming the first man to make the list. Family Guy cartoon character Lois Griffin came 85th.
