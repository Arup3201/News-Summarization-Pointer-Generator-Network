Steven Nzonzi has just been reminded of his role in a TV advert for Venky’s chicken. It was the summer of 2011 and Blackburn’s players were filmed eating platefuls of the stuff in the dressing-room at Ewood Park to promote the club’s new Indian owners.

The final scene features captain Ryan Nelsen licking his fingers as he leads his team down the tunnel, as if this was a perfectly normal pre-match routine.

Mention of that last bit brings a burst of laughter from Nzonzi, his Gallic calm giving way to a fit of the giggles.

The midfielder joined the Potters from Blackburn in 2012 following relegation to the Championship

‘When you think about it that’s really weird, especially as we weren’t doing very well on the pitch,’ says the French midfielder.

‘I don’t get what that was all about. But you think, “yeah they’re new owners and they will do something amazing for the club” so you just follow what they say.’

Venky’s had arrived a few months earlier talking up the prospect of Champions League football and of bringing stars like Ronaldinho to Lancashire. Instead, here were their players reduced to the role of Ronald McDonald.

Less than a year after that advert was shot, the team that Sam Allardyce built had disintegrated and Blackburn had slipped out of the Premier League under his successor Steve Kean. 

‘It was really strange,’ says Nzonzi. ‘I don’t really get what happened, even now.

‘The first season there we finished 10th in the league with Sam Allardyce. The second season wasn’t bad either. After that they changed everything – the owners, the manager, I don’t even know why. So many players left and then it was a completely different club. It fell apart.

Steven Nzonzi has been an ever-present for Stoke in the Premier League this season. In the last three years Nzonzi has started more league games than any other midfielder.

Eden Hazard - 88

Sebastian Larsson - 85 

‘Just look at the players they brought in. Obviously they weren’t David Beckham or Ronaldinho, like they said. What can you do? That’s football. But when players leave the club because they’re not happy it’s not easy.

‘When you see a player like Chris Samba not playing anymore and Michel Salgado just disappear, obviously you know the team will fall apart.

‘I didn’t play the last four games. I got really mad in training and had an argument with the manager (Kean).

‘It’s hard as a player when you see everything change and decisions are made that you don’t expect so I got angry. After that I didn’t play and we were relegated. It was a really hard season.’

Nzonzi left Blackburn after three years and joined Stoke City in a £3.5m deal that summer. He returns to Ewood Park on Saturday for the first time in a competitive fixture in the fifth round of the FA Cup.

The nearest he ever got to playing with Ronaldinho was at Paris Saint-Germain where he admired the Brazil star and Nicolas Anelka from afar as a member of the club’s youth academy.

‘That’s when you realise “why not me?”,’ says N’Zonzi.

He was raised in the Paris suburb of Colombes – also the birthplace of Manchester City’s Eliaquim Mangala – and grew up with his two sisters and brother. The 26-year-old’s father is from Congo, his mother ‘100 per cent French’.

Nzonzi’s performances for Amiens SC earned the youngster a call-up to the France Under-21 national team which then brought him to the attention of Blackburn.

At 6ft 3in tall with a languid style and ability to attack and defend with great effect, comparisons have inevitably been made with Patrick Vieira. His old team Arsenal are not the only club to have cast admiring glances at N’Zonzi.

Mark Hughes has made the midfielder a pivotal part of his Stoke side in attack and defence

‘I’m tall, I play the same position and I’m French so obviously you can make the comparison but I’m not sure it’s fair because it will be hard to match what he’s done,’ he says.

Nzonzi has started every Premier League game for Stoke this season and is a vital cog in the more expansive system implemented by Mark Hughes, being asked to get forward more often in addition to breaking up opposition attacks. Silk and steel.

It involves an incredible workload and at the halfway point of the season he had covered more ground – 134 miles in 19 games – than any other player in the top-flight.

Despite the laid-back demeanour, however, there remains an impetuous streak. Stoke’s coaching staff have had to tell Nzonzi to keep his emotions in check on the pitch. Off it, he has surprisingly ended both of his two seasons at the Britannia Stadium by submitting a transfer request.

‘I don’t regret that,’ he says. ‘I had an issue behind the scenes, not about the football side. It wasn’t fixed (the first time) but now it is so I’m happy.

Nzonzi says he controls his temper much better now, but the red mist can still descend

‘I’m laid-back in life but on the pitch I can get really frustrated and emotional, there’s a big difference.

‘I’m really hard on myself, always have been. I don’t like missing passes. I control it much better now but still sometimes I get frustrated really quickly.’

There is no disguising N’Zonzi’s ambition to play at the highest level. He wants Champions League football and has not abandoned hope of a senior call-up for France having turned down Congo on a couple of occasions.

‘When you’re a kid you want to play in the Premier League and then when you’re here you look at the Champions League and World Cup, everybody wants that,’ he says.

‘That’s what makes you dream and go on every day. Your career goes so quickly. I’m 26 already, I was 21 at Blackburn so, of course, I would love to.’
