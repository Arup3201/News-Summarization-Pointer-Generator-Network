Newtown officials are asking for the help of former students of Sandy Hook elementary to find a special treasure buried in the grounds.

A time capsule from 1980 is buried somewhere at the school where a gunman shot dead 26 people, including 20 children, on December 14 last year.Â 

First Selectman E. Patricia Llodra said 
that she recently learned about the time capsule which contains artwork, 
pictures and other school items.

Children from Sandy Hook Elementary School are now bused to Monroe Chalk Hill School, which has since been renamed Sandy Hook Elementary

Llodra and school officials are seeking 
people who were fifth-graders at the school in 1980 and who remember 
where the capsule is buried.

'It would be interesting to see what's in
that time capsule -- 11-year-olds writing about the future, things that
they wanted people to know about their school and neighborhood,' Llodra told The News-Times of Danbury.

The
school is set to be demolished at the end of the year. Officials are 
proposing to build a new school on the same property.

Llodra says if the
time capsule is found, it can either be opened or reburied outside the 
new school.

Administrators say that Sandy Hook Elementary School, pictured here, will not be torn down until the 1980 capsule is found.

The new school's design will be funded with a $750,000 grant from the state of Connecticut, Llorda said.

There will be a referendum on October 5 to allow the people of Newtown to approve plans to spend the remaining $50million from the state grant.

The school will not be demolished until this final vote. They hope that a new school will be open by September 2016.

Llodra told Newtown Patch that a member of the class first contacted her about the capsule.

Other
students who graduated from Sandy Hook Elementary school told Patch 
that their own classes created time capsules. The exact number of 
capsules on the property is yet to be determined.
