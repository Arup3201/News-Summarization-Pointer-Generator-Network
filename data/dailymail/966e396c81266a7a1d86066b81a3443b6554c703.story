Cincinnati Bengals' Devon Still is melting hearts across America. 

The tough-guy American Footballer has posted a touching video of him giving his four-year-old daughter Leah a pep talk before she went into surgery to remove a cancerous tumor.

The video, posted on Still's Instagram page shows him delivering a 'pre-surgery pep talk' while driving his little girl to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia for treatment on a Stage 4 tumor.

Devon Still and Leah do a non-contact fist-bump in in their reflection at the end of the dad's pre-surgery pep talk

'I'm gonna ask you again,' Still, 24, says to his daughter, sitting behind him in the car. 'I'm ready for today. You ready for today?'

Leah grins, nods and says, 'Uh huh.'

'You ready to get this cancer up out of you?' Devon asks, eliciting an 'mmm-hmm,' from Leah. 

'Let's do it! Fist-bump!' 

Then the athlete and Leah  do a non-contact fist-bump in in their reflection.

Still, who plays defensive tackle for the Cincinnati Bengals, admitted that he was 'nervous and scared beyond words', adding, 'but I'll never let her see it...let's get this done!'

But it seems that Still's pep talk did just the trick. 

He later posted: 'After a 5hr 50min surgery the surgeon was able to remove ALL of her tumor and all of her lymph nodes and her right adrenal gland where it all started from.'

Still, who plays defensive tackle for the Cincinnati Bengals, admitted that he was 'nervous and scared beyond words', adding, 'but I'll never let her see it...let's get this done!'

However, Still made it clear that Leah still faced a long road ahead, as the little girl will require further treatments to remove the cancer in her bone marrow.

He Tweeted: 'Just to clear up some rumors...my daughter is NOT cancer free..today was a big step towards that but still a long road ahead.

'She has stage 4 which means the cancer spread to her bone marrow which we hope will be removed with her next couple of treatments.'

Still has not been able to devote himself fully to football since Leah was diagnosed with Stage 4 neuroblastoma and given a 50-50 chance of survival.

He went public with his daughter's cancer diagnosis 'not for sympathy,' he wrote on Instagram, but 'because I've come to the point where I no longer [am] feeling sorry but [want] to ask that y'all keep my daughter in your prayers...

'I'm gonna ask you again,' Still, 24, says to his daughter, sitting behind him in the car, giggling at her dad's pep talk. 'I'm ready for today. You ready for today?'

'The more prayers that go up, the move faith we [have] that she will overcome this obstacle,' he wrote. 

'if y'all know me y'all know this girl is my world...I know that she is strong and she won't let anything hold her down without a fight.'

Initially missing out on Cincinnati's 53-man roster so he could be by his daughter's side, Still was then offered a spot on the practice squad, ensuring  Leah would be covered under the team's health insurance policy.

Still set up a donation program encouraging people to pledge money for every sack the Bengals' defense gets this season  in an effort to help raise money and awareness about pediatric cancer.

'Kids always look up to their parents, but in just a matter of a week that all reversed for me,' Still wrote on the campaign page

The Cincinnati Bengals have announced they will donate 100 per cent of the proceeds from sales of Devon Still's jersey to the the Cincinnati Children's Hospital

'I can honestly say I truly look up to my daughter now. In the four years of life she has had, she has been through way more than I have in 24. Her courage, strength, and high spirits through it all is nothing short of inspirational.

'So I am dedicating my season to her and inspiring others like she has inspired me.' 

In addition, the Cincinnati Bengals have announced they will  donate 100 per cent of the proceeds from sales of Devon Still's jersey to the  the Cincinnati Children's Hospital.

Still's No.75 jersey sold more in its first 24 hours than any other Bengals jersey had in a single day - partly due to the efforts of New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton, who heard about the fundraising drive, and promptly purchased 100 jerseys.
