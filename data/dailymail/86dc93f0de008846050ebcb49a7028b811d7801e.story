A teenager's weight plummeted to four stone after embarking on the 'Special K' diet resulted in her developing a vicious eating disorder.

Rebekah Clegg, now 22, credits her recovery, and survival from anorexia's grasp to the birth of her daughter Lola, earlier this year.

At the age of 14 Mrs Clegg, weighing 7st 7lb, decided to embark on the cereal-based diet, while taking up running at the same time.

Initially her weight dropped by 4lbs, but after enjoying the compliments from friends, Mrs Clegg 'became obsessed' making drastic cuts to her diet.  

Within four years her weight had plummeted to just 4st, and she appeared so thin each bone on her ribcage was painfully visible.

She was rushed to an eating disorder clinic after consuming just 200 calories a day. 

Seemingly in the clutches of the eating disorder, it was Mrs Clegg's desire to become a mother that saved her.

Warned months of failing to eat properly depriving her body of vital nutrients, could leave her infertile, Mrs Clegg was drawn out of the anorexia black hole consuming her.

The mother-of-one, who now weighs a healthy 8st, said she now enjoys a healthy, balanced diet.

'Four years ago, I never dreamed I'd be a mum and that I wouldn't care about what I weighed,' she said.

'My priority now is being a good mother to my little girl, and that means being as healthy as I can.'

Mrs Clegg, from Southport, Merseyside, said she decided to try out the Special K diet when she heard about it from her school friends, despite being a slim 14-year-old, weighing 7st 7lb at 5ft 5in.

But while friends soon resorted to their old eating habits, Mrs Clegg's obsession grew into the dangerous eating disorder.   

Within six months she started to make even more drastic cuts to her diet and began to exercise regularly.

She said: 'I have never been a chubby child and have always been a normal weight until I was in Year 9.

‘It started off as a silly new diet to try but I became obsessed, I convinced myself that I needed to get thinner.

Now 22, the mother-of-one credits the birth of her daughter Lola, this year, with saving her from the vicious eating disorder

Mrs Clegg, who is pictured while she was in hospital in 2012, embarked on the diet when she was 14 years old. Just before Christmas 2009, when Rebekah's mother Sue, 46, forced her to go to their local GP after her periods had stopped and her clothes were hanging off her skeletal frame

Mrs Clegg weighed 7st 7lbs and was 5ft 5in when she began to develop the eating disorder, aged 14

'I was just a normal teen thinking I wanted to lose weight and was very naïve about it all really, eventually my eating spiralled out of control.

'Every spare chance I got, I spent looking up new exercises and healthy eating tips. And I even enrolled in running classes at school.

'I didn't consider the damage I was doing to my body and how it could affect me having children in the future.

'I felt light-headed all the time and couldn't concentrate on anything when I started college in 2009, I would feel dizzy just from walking a few steps but would still force myself to do my exercises in the mornings.'

It was just before Christmas 2009, when Mrs Clegg's mother Sue, 46, forced her to go to their local GP after her periods had stopped and her clothes were hanging off her skeletal frame.

The 17-year-old weighed in at 5st and the doctor urged her to start eating properly.

But her weight continued to drop and, a month later, she weighed just 4st 10lb. Her doctor referred her to the Priory clinic in Bury.

For a month, she was banned from exercising and nurses would sit her down to eat three meals a day.

She said: 'After each meal we were made to sit in the living room for half an hour, so that nurses could monitor that we weren't secretly exercising.

Mrs Clegg, from Merseyside, was worried her weight could render her infertile, prompting her to face her anorexia. Her daughter Lola, right, was born on February 21, 2014

'Even when I took a shower and went to the bathroom I had to have a nurse with me to supervise.

'I watched horrified as terribly thin girls tried to hide their food in their pockets and ran off to the toilets to make themselves sick, but the staff would always catch them.

'It sometime took the girls over an hour just to eat one meal. 

'I knew if I didn't get better, I would die here in the clinic.'

She attended group therapy and was discharged in July weighing just over 6st but, within two weeks, she began to get anxious when her mother would force her to eat.

Threatened with being readmitted if she didn't eat properly, Mrs Clegg gradually began eating her old favourite foods again. 

As she started to feel better, she got a job as a credit controller and began to enjoy her freedom.

She continued to exercise at the gym but followed a healthy exercise plan this time.

Just weeks into her recovery, she met RAF firefighter Daniel Clegg, 22, in the gym. The couple started dating and three years later Daniel proposed.

Desperate for a family, Mrs Clegg was worried that many years of starving her body might have left her infertile.

When she became pregnant in May 2013, she was overjoyed, and vowed to eat healthily and stop exercising for the sake of her baby.

She said: 'I was ecstatic and so was Daniel but suddenly the reality of eating for two hit me.

‘Briefly, I panicked at the thought of getting bigger and having to eat more but I knew for the sake of our little one I would have finally put it all behind me.

Just weeks into her recovery, she met RAF firefighter Daniel Clegg, 22, in the gym. The couple started dating and three years later Daniel proposed. They married in August, following the birth of their daughter

Mrs Clegg said: 'It has been five years since anorexia gripped my life and now I am now a healthy 8st 1lb. My focus now is my daughter and all I want is for her to grow up, happy and healthy and with her mum the same'

'I decided to eat whenever I was hungry and found myself putting double portions on my plate to make sure my baby was getting all the right nutrients.

'My weight slowly crept up to 8st for the first time in years I didn't care.'

Her daughter Lola was born on February 21, 2014 and the happy couple went on to get married on August 9, 2014.

Mrs Clegg added: 'It has been five years since anorexia gripped my life and now I am now a healthy 8st 1lb.

‘My focus now is my daughter and all I want is for her to grow up, happy and healthy and with her mum the same.'  

A spokeswoman from Kellogs, who manufacture Special K cereal, said they could not comment on individual cases.

She added: ‘The Special K two week plan, which no longer exists, was created by nutritionists for over 18 year olds that have a BMI of over 25.

‘The plan was designed to be followed for two weeks only.’
