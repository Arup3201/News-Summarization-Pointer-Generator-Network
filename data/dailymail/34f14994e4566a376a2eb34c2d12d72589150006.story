Budget supermarket Lidl’s march into Middle England has stalled amid accusations it will lower the tone and complaints of snobbery from ‘toffee-nosed twits’.

Residents in the wealthy London commuter belt town of Berkhamsted, which has its own castle ruins, are taking up the cudgels over whether to welcome the discount store.

The town already has a Waitrose and Tesco Metro, while Marks & Spencer has won permission to open one of its ‘Simply Food’ convenience stores without any sign of controversy.

Petitions have been signed both for and against the budget supermarket setting up a store in the town

Yet more than 100 people have signed a petition opposing the Lidl plan for a new 1,200 square metre store incorporating 30 flats above, with some complaining that it will ‘lower the tone’.

Ranged against them is Germany’s second biggest supermarket chain, and more than 370 locals who have signed a petition supporting the scheme.

The rhetoric in the battle of the online petitions is distinctly earthy with accusations of snobbery and claims opponents are nothing more than ‘stuck up, toffee nosed twits’.

Lidl is making a concerted effort to move into Middle England – as is its German rival Aldi – by snapping up sites in locations where homes cost more than £1million.

The staunchly Middle England commuter town already has a Waitrose, Tesco and will soon have a M&S

It claims new outlets in Dorking and Sevenoaks have been already been a great success. It also plans to open a new 1,200 square metre store just 100 metres from the banks of the River Thames, close to Richmond Bridge, in south west London.

The company has introduced more fresh produce, gourmet food and wine and it also won a number of blind taste test awards, beating the best own label products that the major supermarkets, have to offer.

The woman behind the petition opposing Lidl in Berkhamsted, Cathie George, insists the town does not have the roads and services to support a new supermarket and the 30 flats above. 

She said: ‘Our town is becoming overcrowded with new homes and no extra infrastructure to support them.

‘Berkhamsted does not need another supermarket, budget or otherwise. What it needs is new schools, doctors’ surgeries and other services that a community expects its governing bodies to provide.’

Other supporters of her petitions complained it would lead to overdevelopment of the main high street leading to congestion, while many felt it did not match Berkhamsted’s Middle England brand.

One wrote simply: ‘Don’t want to lower the tone of the town.’ Another said: ’ Personally don’t think it fits in Berkhamsted branding.’ A third complained: ‘We are a Historic Market Town keep it that way! And yes Berko is pricey but we have a good looking town!’

Another wrote: ‘I think our traditional high streets should be protected against these poxy low budget corporations that wipe out local trade.’

One contributor joked: ‘One good thing about Lidl coming to Berkhamsted: it’ll keep the riff-raff away from Waitrose.’

Resident, John Waller, 70, who supports the Lidl scheme, which should create 40 jobs, said there was no fuss when it was announced that M&S would be opening a Simply Food store in the town.He described people opposing the Lidl as ‘snobs’ and added: ‘They are a lot of stuck-up, toffee-nosed twits.’

It appears from the online petition supporting the scheme, that a greater number of local residents support this view.

One wrote: ‘I bet most or if not all the people that signed the petition are on over £50,000 a year. There are a lot of people that welcome Lidl to the town. We can’t all afford to shop in Waitrose. You are all cnobs if you don’t want to shop there for little Oliver’s , Nathan’s or Cuthbert’s lunch then don’t.’

Another said: ‘Well said John Waller. I am sure they would welcome another Waitrose but don’t want Berko to be known as a Lidl town.’

A third supporter wrote: ‘There may be good reasons to criticise Lidl but let’s face, the only reason these moaners are trying to stop this is because a low-budget shop will lower the tone of the area and bring their precious house prices tumbling down. Bring it on, I say!’

Lidl is enjoying enormous success in the UK with some 600 outlets and sales growing at more than 17per cent a year as it takes customers from the big four – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons.Its ‘Deluxe’ range is particularly designed to win middle class shoppers. At Christmas, the range included a £5.99 cooked lobster, fine cooked meats, including a serrano ham for £39.99, and quality continental cheeses.

The firm recently held a consultation day where Berkhamsted residents were shown the plan and given a chance to comment. It said 73per cent of some 400 individual comments recorded were in favour of the scheme.

A spokesman said: ‘We have seen great success from opening stores in particularly affluent areas such as Dorking and Sevenoaks, which shows that Lidl has developed an increasingly broad appeal to the British people.’
