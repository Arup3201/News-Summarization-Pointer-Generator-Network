Police are under pressure to question the multi-millionaire founder of Wonga, Errol Damelin (pictured), over his role in the decision to send bogus legal letters to thousands of customers

Police are under pressure to question the multi-millionaire founder of Wonga, Errol Damelin, over his role in the decision to send bogus legal letters to thousands of customers.

Mr Damelin stepped down from the payday loan giant two weeks ago as the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority(FCA), prepared to issue a damning judgment on Wonga’s treatment of customers.

The South African businessman founded Wonga in 2007 and was chief executive at the time the company invented two law firms and sent threatening letters to 45,000 customers who were behind on repayments.

Despite this, he has walked away from the company with a personal fortune estimated at more than £34million and without suffering any sanction.

The FCA has ordered Wonga to pay compensation of some £2.6million to the customers involved, which is pocket money to the wealthy company and works out at flat rate of just £50 each.

But that has left consumer groups and MPs demanding to know why Mr Damelin and Wonga have not been investigated under a series of possible criminal offences.

Earlier this week, sources at the FCA indicated that the City of London Police were asked to investigate Wonga’s activities by its predecessor, the Office of Fair Trading(OFT), last year and they decided not to take any action.

However, this has been denied by the police, while Wonga says the company and its executives were never contacted by officers.

There are a number of potential offences which Wonga may have committed including a breach of The Solicitors Act of 1974, which makes it an offence for someone to falsely claim to be a solicitor.

There is also the Administration of Justice Act, which make it a crime to harass debtors, as well as the Fraud Act and the Theft Act.

Marc Gander of the Consumer Action Group said: ‘Clearly there are a very large number of victims.  Each one has been mugged by Wonga.

‘It seems to me that no-one – not the OFT, the Financial Services Authority, not the FCA or the police have focussed on the effect upon the victims and the sheer scale of what has gone on.‘

Investigations should be carried out. 
Apart from who knew what was going on - who came up with the idea?  Who 
approved it?  Who put it into action? ‘Of course, Mr Damelin as the 
chief executive and the man running the company at the time should be 
investigated. If action is not taken then it will undermine confidence 
in the regulatory process once again.’

Wonga has been slammed for pressurising indebted to customers by sending letters from fake law firms

Conservative MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, Mark Field, said there appear to be grounds for urgent police action.

He said: ‘I support this industry, but Wonga isn’t doing itself any favours with this type of sharp practice and it’s a matter of urgency for police attention. Wonga is its own worst enemy on this and this could be the tip of the iceberg.’

Labour MP John Mann has called for the Treasury Select Committee to investigate the payday loan industry and the apparent inability of City watchdogs to fine Wonga for historic offences.

‘The idea that a company can send thousands are letters to customers from imaginary law firms and the regulator not able to fine them is something I and the majority of people in the UK will find appalling,’ he said.

Labour MP, Andy McDonald, told MPs in the House of Commons yesterday there was a good case for investigating the directors and removing their right to hold a credit licence.

Labour has been keen to play up the fact that a major donor to the Conservative party also holds a huge stake in Wonga, which is said to be worth more than £380million.

Adrian Beecroft, who has donated more than £500,000 to the Conservatives since 2006, is also the chairman of Dawn Capital, which has made a fortune from investing in Wonga.

Labour MP, Andy Sawford, suggested the only way to make Wonga suffer would be to apply the same interest rates it uses for customers to the £2.6million the company has been told to repay.

Using this calculation, he suggested the company would have to hand back £203 trillion.

Speaking during the weekly Commons business statement, Mr Sawford said: ‘Can we have emergency legislation on compensation and compound interest to make Wonga pay out not £2.6 million compensation for unfair practice but at their own outrageous interest rates of 5,853per cent, make them pay £203 trillion?

‘Perhaps then they would understand the misery they cause?’

Mr Damelin, 44, has made no comment on the Wonga fiasco since details were released earlier this week.

Wonga claimed the businessman, who was educated at Cape Town University, had departed in what it called an ‘orderly exit from the company’ that would allow him to work on new business ventures.

The fiercely private individual spilt from his wife Julie, the mother of the couple’s three young children, last year after 15 years of marriage in what was described as an amicable break.

Wonga has apologised for the letters and insists that all the managers who were in place at the time they were sent between 2008 and 2010 have since left the business.

Asked whether Mr Damelin had suffered any sanction for his part in the fiasco, the company said: ‘The historic debt collection letters are Wonga’s responsibility, and so we won’t be commenting on particular individuals.

‘We provided information on the letters to the OFT in 2011, and since then have been working with them and our current regulator the FCA on a resolution for customers. No-one from the company has been interviewed by the police on this matter.’
