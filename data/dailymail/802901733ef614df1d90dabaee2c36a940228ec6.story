He's the clean-cut aristocrat who was reportedly left devastated when girlfriend Cressida Bonas left him for Prince Harry.

Now it seems the boot is on the other foot, after Harry Wentworth-Stanley, 26, was pictured clutching Miss Bonas' hand as they stepped out together on Valentine's Day.

But the prince wasn't at home nursing broken heart. Instead, he remains in Verbier, where he is enjoying a skiing holiday with his cousins Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.

The 30-year-old was pictured wearing a blue helmet, black ski jacket and white trousers as he took a drag lift up the mountain in Verbier.

With practised ease, he then whizzed back down, enjoying views of the picturesque resort where his uncle Prince Andrew owns a chalet as he went.

Eugenie was seen taking a chair lift up the mountain as the royal cousins continued to enjoy their stay in the Alps, where they were last pictured hitting the piste on Friday.  

Back in London, Harry's ex was spotted walking hand-in-hand through the streets with Harry Wentworth-Stanley, who she has been friends with since they met at Leeds University.

Miss Bonas, who is reportedly in talks with Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes over a role in the drama, cut a stylish figure in a leather jacket and a thigh-skimming sweater dress.

Mr Wentworth Stanley, a graduate surveyor with high-end property company Savills, was well-wrapped up against the chill, and had layered a petrol-blue bomber jacket over his navy jumper.

He is not the first man that Miss Bonas, 25, has been linked to since ending her relationship with Prince Harry last summer.

In January, the budding actress was spotted with Riot Club actor Freddie Fox, 26, at a West End screening of Tim Burton’s movie Big Eyes.

‘Freddie and Cressida were very close and affectionate,’ a guest at the London screening told The Mail on Sunday at the time.

‘They spent half an hour deep in conversation in a corner by the bar. When the film started, they had to sit separately because there weren’t any seats together and they both looked very disappointed.’

Cressida Bonas is the Queen of Cool. Just take this ensemble on Prince Harry's ex-gf. Like us, Cressida is a big fan of an all-black palette. Top-to-toe black is the uniform for many style mavens as it's an instant way to work a chic and confident aesthetic, it's anything but bland!

We love how Cressida has paired her sweater dress with a leather contrast sleeve bomber jacket and a pair of classic Air Max kicks. The get-up has that cool London dweller look written all over it!

A pair of Air Max sneakers will be one of the hardest working pieces in your wardrobe as they're just so versatile so why not click right to get yours from Footlocker now?

We'll be wearing ours with EVERYTHING from mini dresses like Cress to our favorite black skinnie jeans and a chunky sknit for a fashion editor finish.

The following week, the pair were seen together once again at Los Angeles celebrity hotspot Chateau Marmont, although the actor later denied that he and Miss Bonas were in a relationship.

Fox, who is currently starring in Channel 4 drama Cucumber, went on to reveal that he is bisexual in an interview with the Telegraph, saying he wouldn't wish to say 'I am this or I am that'. 

'I’ve had girlfriends, but I wouldn’t wish to say "I am this or I am that", because at some time in my life I might fall in love with a man,' he explained.

'I hope that I am the type of person who would fall in love with another person, as opposed to a sex. Most of my life to date has been as a straight man, but who knows what will happen next?'

One man who has no such debate about his sexuality is Mr Wentworth-Stanley, who dated Miss Bonas while studying for a degree in Business Management and Spanish.

The couple's relationship fizzled out after he departed for a gap year in Buenos Aires, but friends say the pair have remained close.

According to one, Mr Wentworth-Stanley was unhappy to hear of Miss Bonas' relationship with Prince Harry when news first emerged, leaving her torn. 

'Cressida is still very fond of her ex-boyfriend and, since Harry’s been on the scene, he’s been after her again,’ said the source at the time.

'Cressida is torn. She likes Harry but is not the sort to be bothered about his title.'

Since returning from Buenos Aires, Mr Wentworth-Stanley, who is the son of Clare Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven, has based himself in London and completed a part-time Masters degree in Real Estate at the capital's South Bank University last year.

After completing a two-month secondment at luxury property company Finchatton, he rejoined Savills' graduate scheme and is expected to complete his education this Spring.

Like Miss Bonas, his family background is a colourful one, with the 26-year-old amassing three half-siblings from his father's second marriage and two step-siblings from his mother's.

He also has a sister, Louisa, but was hit by a family tragedy in 2006 when his older brother James, an accomplished polo player known to friends as 'the Golden Boy', committed suicide.

Speaking at the time, Mr Wentworth-Stanley's father Nick revealed that he had 'wondered desperately' whether anything could have been done to prevent the tragedy.

'Words cannot describe the desperate frustration a parent suffers through losing a child this way,' he said.

'You play back everything in your mind, over and over, wondering desperately if there was something more one could have done to prevent it.'

Since then, Mr Wentworth-Stanley and Lady Milford-Haven, who edits the Bystander pages at society magazine, Tatler, have set up a charity in their son's name to raise awareness of the high rates of suicide among young men.
