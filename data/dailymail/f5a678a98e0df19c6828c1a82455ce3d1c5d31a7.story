Lululemon is on the lookout for a new CEO to take charge of its 'fun and irreverent brand' but the requirements for its jokey job posting could prove to be a tall order.

The high-end yoga and active apparel company took posted some help wanted ads in stores around the country and on Facebook for a new CEO.

The job requires applicants to be fluent in Sanskrit and to define work-life balance as 'downing wheatgrass and tequila shots on Fridays.'

'You report to no one, you are the CEO (duh). You are passionate about doing chief executive officer type stuff like making decisions, having a vision and being the head boss person,' the company's job posting states.

Job opening: Applicants can apply through the Lululemon website but there is a rather long list of 'requirements' before you can have the job!

Requirements: You plan to bring Lululemon to Mars by 2018 and best of all 'you report to no one, you are the CEO (duh)'

The fictitious job description continues: 'Additional qualities desired for a new company-wide boss include being able to hold a headstand for at least 10 minutes, serious yoga proficiency and having celebrities like Ellen DeGeneres and Oprah Winfrey on speed dial.'

The ad hints at the company's lofty goals: 'You’re a long-term thinker. You already have a plan to bring yoga and luon to Mars by 2018'

The job description also attempts to display some of the fashion company's creativity making a wisecrack about your CEO position within the senior management team.

'You elevate and cultivate the level of talent within the senior leadership team by holding The Bachelor lululemon. Only one successful SVP will get the final rose.'

CEO Christine Day: She insists her departure is entirely her decision and unrelated to the problem with the black luon, the fabric from which the transparent pants were made

Talent wanted: The job jokingly requires applicants to be fluent in Sanskrit - the language of Yoga

One of your 'contacts': Would be great to have people like Bill Clinton, Ellen DeGeneres and Oprah Winfrey as one of your friends wouldn't it?

Job for you? You actively live and breathe the lululemon culture – on Friday afternoons you hit up wheatgrass and tequila shots (it’s called work/life balance

Despite the crazy off-the-wall requirements, so far, 160 people have actually replied to the ad.

The light-hearted posting comes after a dark few months for the company.

Since
 it was announced that current CEO Christine Day would be leaving the 
company, the Canadian company's stock plummeted approximately 20 
percent.

Under Day, 
Lululemon suffered a public relations nightmare that forced them to pull
 their $100 a pair yoga pants from shelves for being too sheer when 
wearers bent over.

Costly: Lululemon pulled its Luon pants from stores over in March after the company determined that the pants' fabric was too sheer and revealing

Career: Day has been the head of luxury yoga-wear maker Lululemon since 2008. Before that, she worked as an executive at Starbucks

Dropping faster than their leggings: Shares fell nearly 20% in the week since the announcement  had been made

The 
March recall cost Lululemon approximately $60 million in lost sales and 
threatened the brand's reputation for quality apparel.

The
 company has started to restock its shelves with a re-engineered version
 of their Luon pant that spawned so many devotees in the first place.

While the posting may say that the CEO answers no one, whoever does land the job will have to answer to shareholders.

Shares
 of Lululemon are down more than 3% since the sheer pants news broke, 
and nearly 19% since Day stepped down as CEO last Monday.
