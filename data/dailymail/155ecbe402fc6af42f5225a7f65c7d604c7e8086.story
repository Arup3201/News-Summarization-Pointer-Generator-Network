Water still laps at the foot of the elevators in the elegant atrium. A piano stands eerily intact, seemingly ready to be played. These haunting pictures show the remarkably preserved interior of the doomed Costa Concordia.

Images were released yesterday showing the cabins and passageways of the wrecked luxury ship as work began to refloat the vessel in the largest maritime salvage operation in history.

The 114,500-tonne Concordia, longer than the Titanic, was one of the most glamorous cruise ships to sail the ocean and boasted a casino, spa, several bars and dining areas.

But now wires hang down over the empty stools in the bar areas while the paint has been stripped off the walls of the once elaborately and colourfully decorated hallways.

Rusting shambles: One of the 13 bars where many of the 3,200 passengers were relaxing as the vessel struck a rock off Isola del Giglio at 9.45pm

Haunting: The first pictures of the interior of the sunken cruise ship Costa Concordia, which struck a reef off the island of Giglio in January 2012 and capsized, killing 32 people. This seemingly undamaged piano was in an area that remained above water

Some areas are relatively unscathed because they remained above the waterline after the ship capsized in shallow water. Other rooms have been drained after the ship was righted last year

Chaos: Smashed crockery and intact wine bottles in a galley which was not submerged

Some areas are relatively unscathed 
because they remained above the waterline after the ship capsized in 
shallow water. Other rooms have been drained after the ship was righted 
last year.

The wreck 
will soon be towed away and broken up for scrap, nearly two-and-a-half 
years after she ran aground off the Italian island of Gigilo.

The
 290-metre liner, which smashed into rocks off the picturesque holiday 
island in January 2012 with the loss of 32 lives, has for nine months 
been sitting deep in the water, resting on a specially-constructed 
platform made of steel girders and thousands of sacks of cement.

In
 what has become one of the largest salvage operations in history, air 
was pumped into 30 large metal boxes, attached around the hull of the 
114,500 tonne ship. The air forced out the water in the boxes, lifting 
the vessel off the underwater platform.

Honour the dead: The refloating of the ship revived hopes that the body of Russel Rebello, an Indian waiter who was among the 32 dead and whose remains have never been found, might finally be recovered

Authorities expressed satisfaction that the operation to float the Concordia had proceeded without a hitch

Authorities expressed satisfaction that the operation to float the Concordia had proceeded without a hitch.

Franco Porcellachia, the engineer in charge of the salvage, said at a news conference around seven hours after the operation began that the hulk had been raised two metres out of the water.

Tug boats attached cables to the ship then started shifting it away from the shore. It was hoped to be re-anchored some 30m away.

Mr Porcellachia said: 'I would say we are halfway through our plan to move the ship.'

He said the sixth deck of the ship had started to emerge today, and once that was fully above the water the other decks would become visible in quick succession.

Costa concordia 

The control room is seen on the Costa Concordia after it was successfully re-floated today, being raised some 2m off the platform that was supporting it

Bubbles: Foam and bubbles rise from the ocean as the stricken hulk was refloated this morning

Tragedy: The 290-metre liner, which smashed into rocks off the picturesque holiday island in January  2012 with the loss of 32 lives

Still missing: an Italian official has promised that a search will be conducted for the only unrecovered body of the 32 Costa Concordia shipwreck victims as soon as the wrecked cruise liner is towed away from the island

Scrap: If all is well, it will be towed away from Giglio on July 21 to the port of Genoa 200 miles away and sold for scrap

The vessel was today successful re-floated

Then stabilised with chains and cables

The vessel will then be towed 30m east and reanchored

Work will begin tomorrow to prepare it to depart for Giglo on July 21

It is expected to complete the 320km journey in five days

And will then be broken up and sold as scrap

Work will start again tomorrow to prepare it for towing within days to Genoa, in northern Italy, to be scrapped.

The wreck is due to depart Giglio on July 21 and it is expected to take five days to complete the 320km journey.

Once
 the Concordia has left Giglio, the search will continue for the body of
 the last person who was aboard that remains unaccounted for.

Italian
 Environment Minister Gian Luca Galletti said: 'We are undertaking an 
operation that will close a dramatic chapter for our country.'

The area where the ship had rested is one of Europe's largest marine sanctuaries -- a haven for 
dolphins and whales -- and environmentalists had warned about the 
dangers of toxic waste or fuel leaking into the sea as the ship is 
raised and towed.

The
 Concordia crashed on the 
night of January 13, 2012, forcing many of its 4,229 passengers and crew
 from 70 countries to jump into the sea as lifeboat pulleys failed.

The
 ship's captain Francesco Schettino is on trial for manslaughter, 
causing a shipwreck, and abandoning the vessel before all passengers had
 evacuated.

Four
 other crew members and a Costa Crociere executive have plea-bargained 
and the company has accepted limited responsibility as Schettino's 
employer.  

Refloated: The capsized cruise liner Costa Concordia is seen at the end of the "parbuckling" operation outside Giglio harbour. Salvage crews on the Italian island of Giglio raised the Costa Concordia cruise liner completing one of the most difficult and expensive wreck recovery projects ever performed

Air pump: Air will be pumped into the 30 giant box-like compartments that have been welded to its hull, forcing out seawater and raising the vessel by around 36ft

Emerging: Four decks of the ship will emerge from beneath the waves for the first time since the ship ran aground

Nervous start: The first few hours of the refloat will be the most critical, engineers have warned

Length: 290 metres (951 feet)

Weight: 114,500 tonnes

Wrecked on: January 13 2012

Sponsons needed for refloat: 30

Number of experts needed for refloat: 42

Paying
 for the disaster, including breaking up the vessel and repairing the 
damage to Giglio, is likely to cost the ship's owner and operator Costa Crociere, a unit of Carnival Corp, more than £1.5billion, its chief executive said last week.

Shopkeeper
 Silvia said the residents are now looking forward to 'waving farewell 
to the rusting hulk blighting our once pristine shoreline.'

The refloating of the ship revived hopes 
that the body of Russel Rebello, an Indian waiter who was among the 32 
dead and whose remains have never been found, might finally be 
recovered.

Franco Gabrielli, who heads the Civil Protection Department overseeing the 
wreck's removal, said it was a 'great sorrow' the body of the waiter was never found.
