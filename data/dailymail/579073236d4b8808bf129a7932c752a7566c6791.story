A barrister walking from John O’Groats to Land’s End for charity was injured in a hit-and-run accident, just 16 miles after he started.

Dave Redmond, 31, was on the first day of his planned seven-week walk when he was clipped by a campervan and tossed into a verge.

The father-of-one was raising money for three charities - Macmillan Cancer Support, the MS Society and Help for Heroes.

Walking for chairty: Dave Redmond was just 16 miles into his 1,100-mile journey when he was clipped by a campervan that was driving on the wrong side of the road. His trek has been postponed for at least two weeks

Mr Redmond, a barrister from Dunstable, Bedfordshire, will now have to postpone his trek - which has raised more than £3,000 - for at least two weeks because of his injuries.

He was walking on the side of the road when the campervan, driving the wrong way, came up behind him.

He said that the wing mirror clipped him and that the pack he was carrying acted as a buffer, according to posts on his Twitter page.

Despite suffering multiple injuries to his arm, ankle and collarbone, Mr Redmond was able to walk another six miles after the accident.

An elderly couple in a passing car noticed the lone rambler and took him to a nearby caravan site outside Wick, Caithness.

Mr Redmond initially refused to go to hospital and was looked after by site owners Trisha and William Miller.

Bold feat: The father-of-one has raised more than £3,000 for three charities - Macmillan Cancer Support, the MS Society and Help for Heroes. His target is £5,000, according to his fundraising page

'When he 
came at first, he wasn’t saying much and he actually only told me he’d 
hurt his ankle with absolutely nothing mentioned about the accident,' 
said Mrs Miller.

'We told him there was a hospital near at hand but he decided not to go.

'He came back about an hour later and told us he thought he should go to hospital so we got someone to take him around.

'It wasn’t until we picked him up later that he told us everything that had happened. I actually wonder if we wasn’t concussed when he first came in to us.'

The hospital found the criminal barrister had suffered damage to his arm, shoulder and ankle.

Training: Mr Redmond from Dunstable, Bedfordshire uses walking sticks on a training walk ahead of his trek from John O'Groats to Land's End. He initially refused to go to hospital after the accident

'It’s so sad what happened to him as he came so far north and was all geared up for his challenge,' said Mrs Miller.

'To see him with a hurt arm and unable to pick up his rucksack was so upsetting.

'It could have been a lot more serious as he could have been left in a ditch and then hypothermia could have set in.'

Mr Redmond has reported the incident to police but, as he was unable to record and give a registration number, the culprit may go uncaught.

Injured: Mr Redmond, pictured on a previous walk. He suffered injuries to his arm, shoulder and ankle which mean that he will not be able to sustained weight on either leg for up to six weeks

On his Twitter account, Mr Redmond said he wanted to thank everyone who had helped him and he has donated his campsite fee to his fundraising page because the Millers refused to keep it.

He will not be able to hike for at least two weeks and will not be able to carry a backpack for far longer due to damage to his collarbone.

Doctors think it will be between four and six weeks before he can put any sustained weight on either leg.

All the money raised by Mr Redmond’s walk was to be divided equally between his three chosen charities of Macmillan Cancer Support, the MS Society and Help for Heroes.
