Jese and James Rodriguez shot Real Madrid four points clear at the top of La Liga on Wednesday night as they beat Sevilla 2-1 despite a late goal from Liverpool loanee Iago Aspas.

Carlo Ancelotti’s team took the points at a price with three key players ruled out of Saturday’s Madrid derby – first Sergio Ramos hobbled off hamstrung, then James Rodriguez, who had scored the first, went off with a metatarsal injury, and Marcelo was then booked meaning he will be suspended for the next game if Real are unsuccessful with a planned appeal.

Sevilla also lost a player before the break with keeper Beto taken to hospital after clashing with Karim Benzema. Despite losing their keeper and going 2-0 down in the first half Sevilla made it difficult for Real with substitute Aspas reminding his manager Unai Emery and Liverpool coach Brendan Rodgers, that he knows where the goal is.

Sevilla started the game brightly with Vitolo denied in a one-on-one with Casillas inside two minutes. Ramos then overstretched in a challenge and had to hobble off holding his hamstring.

Madrid took the lead four minutes later when  Rodriguez had the time and space to allow a Marcelo cross to bounce in front of him before heading it home.

It was Rodriguez’s eighth league goal which is more than Angel Di Maria managed in any of his four seasons at Real Madrid. The Colombian has banished all lingering doubts that Real Madrid were wrong to replace one with the other last summer.

Sevilla were by no means out of the game and when Vitolo slipped a pass through for Vicente Iborra the midfielder might have equalized but instead hit the post.

With Sevilla’s next attack he again found space unmarked but this time his shot was saved by Casillas and Carlos Bacca couldn’t reach the rebound.

Having already seen Ramos go off Madrid lost James Rodriguez to a right foot injury that Madrid will hope is not a metatarsal break. Jese was the logical change.

The next man down was Sevilla keeper Beto who was flattened by Karim Benzema. The Portuguese keeper felt the full force of the Frenchman’s knee as both went for a Jese cross inside the six-yard box. For the second game running the Sevilla keeper was unable to finish a game and just as last weekend; he was replaced by substitute goalkeeper Sergio Rico.

The first thing Rico had to do was pick the ball out of the back of the net. Bacca gave possession away and Isco took over spraying it wide right to Benzema whose intelligent pull-back was intended for Jese. Isco almost intercepted it but let it run for the substitute who drilled it past Rico.

Bale then fed Alvaro Arbeloa and his pull-back was fired just wide by Benzema. Sevilla had the chances to be ahead but could easily have found themselves 3-0 down. It was little wonder they were losing their heads. Diogo Figueiras was booked for hacking down Jese and Fernando Navarro followed him into the book for a foul on Bale.

Raphael Varane was then booked for handball as Real did their best to coast to half time.

Bale had been left alone by the boo-boys in the first half and he wowed the crowd inside the Bernabeu with a delightful scooped pass that played in Sami Khedira only for the German to squander the chance. The ridiculous debate about the effectiveness of a player who has won four trophies in less than two seasons scoring in three finals will continue, but most sensible Madrid fans accept Bale’s enourmous contribution.

M’bia kicked, and trod-on, Khedira just before the break and was lucky to only be booked – the last thing Madrid needed was a third enforced first half change.

The second half started with Real looking to finish Sevilla off as soon as possible. Bale created, but then missed, the first chance cutting in from the right and with Benzema in space to his left the boo boys had their chance but never took it. The extent to which the abuse aimed at Bale should not be taken seriously can't be underestimated – moments later Jese smashed a shot against the frame of the goal from a tight angle with other options on and there was nothing but applause for the local boy. Bale the serial trophy-winner remains the outsider; Ronaldo had the same problem not so long ago.

Bale was suffering at the hands of the opposition and Fernando Navarro should have seen his second yellow of the night when he up-ended the former Tottenham man. Madrid were now in full flow and Benzema failed to finish a sweeping move down the left that involved Jese and Marcelo.

Sevilla brought on Liverpool loanee Aspas and with ten minutes left he pulled a goal back for the visitiors. Sevilla’s man of the match Vitolo dribbled along the byline from the left and Aspas tapped in from inside the six-yard box.

The striker grabbed the ball from the back of the net and charged back up for the restart. Madrid had been showboating with only Vitolo’s dive over Arbeloa’s leg, for which he was booked, their only chance. The late goal meant Ancelotti’s team had to nervously count down the last few minutes but they held out. Aspas had proved a point, but Real Madrid had taken all three.
