With the spectre of redundancy hanging over them, council workers were no doubt filled with trepidation when an email from their boss landed in their inbox.

But the civil servants were left aghast when environment chief Terry Dunn signed off his update on plans to slash jobs by chatting about his upcoming wedding, honeymoon and favourite punk rock bands.

Now Mr Dunn, director of Wigan Council’s environment department, is being compared to comic character David Brent for his insensitivity.

He told workers they ‘may or may not 
be directly impacted’ by the authority’s restructuring plans, adding: 
‘If you are involved I can fully appreciate the concerns you will have 
and just ask for your patience.’

But his e-mail then started to echo 
the character played by Ricky Gervais in The Office, when he gave miffed
workers a run down of his social life. It said: ‘On the home front; off
to a punk rock festival in Blackpool this Friday. The Damned, Stiff 
Little Fingers and the Buzzcocks are amongst the acts playing so those 
old enough may remember them. I am really looking forward to it as it 
forms a big part of my past.’

He then added: ‘Wedding six weeks this Saturday followed by two weeks in Fuerteventura!! Can’t wait.’

Mr Dunn’s chummy email, sent on Monday, was received less than enthusiastically by his 200 staff.

One said: ‘The restructure affects 
everybody. Many job titles have changed and staff have to reapply for 
their own jobs, if they still have them. So not good times for Wigan 
employees.’

Union boss Kevan Nelson, Unison’s north west secretary, agreed the email was ‘inappropriate’.

‘It is a bit David Brent,’ Mr Nelson 
said. ‘He probably meant it well but has underestimated the impact of 
these changes on his staff.

‘I recognise there is a style of 
management where you don’t want to appear overly-autocratic, but talking
about your plans when people’s livelihoods are in the balance is not a 
good idea.’

In one episode of the popular BBC 
comedy, Brent famously announced to staff they were being made redundant
by saying he had ‘good news and bad news’. The apparent good news was 
that he himself was being promoted.

Mr Dunn, who joined Wigan Council 
straight from school in the early 80s, is responsible for waste, roads 
and recycling in Greater Manchester’s second-biggest council.

The authority, which needs to cut 200
jobs this year to save £18.8million, said the senior manager was 
responding to staff feedback which called for more ‘personalised’ 
messages.

A spokesman said: ‘Terry Dunn has 
been employed by Wigan Council since he was taken on as an apprentice 
and has worked at virtually every level of the organisation. He has 
known many of our staff for 20 years.

‘These are tough times in local 
government. We’re trying to communicate with employees as best we can 
while we go through difficult changes.

‘Terry meant no harm and is sorry if 
he’s caused offence on this occasion. He has an excellent record of 
handling staffing issues seriously and sensitively.’

One of Mr Dunn’s colleagues added: 
‘Terry is a decent bloke. He is not one of your typical town hall 
bureaucrats. He worked his way up after starting as an apprentice.

‘Probably he should have realised the tone was totally wrong, but he wouldn’t have meant any offence.’

Mr Dunn’s gaffe came as it emerged 
the chief executive of another company told staff they had lost their 
jobs by saying an ‘opportunity’ had arisen for them to start looking for
new work.

Jason Goldberg, of internet firm 
Fab.com, informed workers the business would be losing 100 workers in 
its Berlin office to allow it to focus more on the US, according to 
London’s City A.M. newspaper.

In an email Mr Goldberg said: 
‘Directly after this meeting you will learn what category your job falls
into and whether you will have the opportunity to start your new job 
search immediately.’
