One posing craze was meant to honour an NFL player fast becoming a hero among fans of every team for his open faith and no-nonsense playing style. The other isn’t quite as complimentary.

Americans aren’t letting New England Patriots veteran quarterback Tom Brady, 34, forget how his side lost 21-17 to New York Giants in Super Bowl XLVI on Sunday in Indianapolis, Indiana.

The ‘Bradying’ craze sees people photographed sitting with their arms between their outstretched legs and their faces pointing to the ground - and it’s sweeping the U.S. as fast as ‘Tebowing’.

Strange locations: 'Bradying' is catching on, with fans uploading their pictures to a website, which carries the motto: 'It's all about winning. And hair. And winning hair. Upload your best Bradying photo'

Crestfallen: Americans aren't letting New England Patriots veteran quarterback Tom Brady, 34, forget how his side lost 21-17 to New York Giants in Super Bowl XLVI on Sunday in Indianapolis, Indiana

That craze, which honoured Denver 
Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow, 24, and started last October, is still 
going strong after actor Alec Baldwin mimicked it on Saturday at an NFL 
awards ceremony.

But now 
‘Bradying’ is catching on, with fans uploading their pictures to a 
website, which carries the motto: ‘It's all about winning. And hair. And
winning hair. Upload your best Bradying photo’.

Brady’s
Patriots lost the dramatic game on Sunday and a picture of him looking 
crestfallen, sitting with his hands between his legs, went viral and was
mocked relentlessly by Giants fans.

The
craze comes after Brady’s wife Gisele Bundchen was taunted by fans in 
New York and Boston, Massachusetts, where the Patriots are based, for 
blaming his team-mates for Sunday’s defeat.

Familiar theme: Brady was also pictured in the same position in other games against the Miami Dolphins last December, left, and the Baltimore Ravens in January 2010

Other craze: 'Tebowing', which honoured Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow, 24, and started last October, is still going strong. Tebow is pictured here in a game against the New England Patriots last month

Many in Boston are angry with the supermodel after she yelled that her husband can't ‘f***ing throw the ball and catch the ball at the same time’. She faced criticism from Giants players too.

'Even if both make you laugh a bit, I think the motives behind Tebowing are more pure and will last much further down the road. Tebowing isn't just a meme with pictures on a website'

But Tebowing.com creator Jared Kleinstein told the Huffington Post he doesn’t believe ‘Bradying’ will be a long-running craze, because it intends to mock rather than praise a quarterback.

‘Even if both make you laugh a bit, I think the motives behind Tebowing are more pure and will last much further down the road,’ he said. ‘Tebowing isn't just a meme with pictures on a website.’

‘It’s a humbled position - shoulders down, head down - that’s all about being humbled,’ former Army expert on body language and interrogation Greg Hartley told the New York Post.

The 'Tebowing' craze, which saw people mimic Tebow by dropping to their knees in a prayer pose, followed 'planking', where men and women lied down down on odd objects and in strange places.
