The millionaire CEO of Victoria's Secret promised her lover they would start a new life together in London and even said he could be a designer for the famous lingerie brand, it was alleged today.

The explosive news that Sharen Jester Turney had a two-year affair with luxury real estate broker Cliff Donenfeld is said to have sent her scurrying home from the office on Tuesday so she could break the news to her husband of more than 20 years, according to a source.

Donenfeld, 50, said that Turney, 56, 
promised she would leave her husband Charles for him so they could start
a life together and even suggested they adopt a baby.

He now claims the 56-year-old was thinking of taking up a position with luxury British retailer Harrods during their affair in 2010.

She mentioned the possibility of the alleged couple relocating during a trip to her prestigious alma mater, the Wharton School, he claimed to the New York Post.

'At the time, she was discussing a 
move to Harrods,' Donenfeld told Page Six. 'She said it would be much 
easier to start our lives over again in London. She said she’d place me 
in a job at Harrods.'

He also claims he gave her advice on everything from Victoria's Secret famous catwalk show and even what she would wear.

'She didn’t go out in public without my input,' he said.

'I was instrumental in every aspect of her life for two years. I was her sounding board, personally and professionally.'

The 50-year-old has spoken out about 
their alleged two-year affair after Turney allegedly refused to give him
a reference for a job in fashion.

Soon after they began their secret romance, he broke up with his girlfriend and the couple soon started meeting regularly in New York, Florida and Columbus, Ohio, where the famous lingerie line is based

Donenfeld claims Turney - who earned more than $25million in 2012 - promised him a multimillion dollar home in Naples' Port Royal community. But all he got was a Cartier watch.

Soon after, he made an appointment for her to see a New York divorce lawyer but, 'she wanted to wait until after the holidays to let her husband Charles know', he said.

By 2010, the relationship started to break down but they stayed friends, he claims.

Representatives for the company and Turney did not respond to requests for comment.

Victoria's Secret hired Turney in 2000 as president and CEO of Victoria's Secret Direct, the brand's catalog and e-commerce arm, where she drove sales to $1billion.
