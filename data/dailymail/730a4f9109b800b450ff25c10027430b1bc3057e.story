A new supercharged jet ski claims to be so fast that it 'practically pullls your arms off'.

The Black Edition 360 Sea-Doo has a top speed of 80mph and is as powerful as a Porsche, according to its manufacturers.

It is quicker and more powerful than any other commercially-available model.

The ultimate special edition beach toy has a terrifying 360 brake horsepower - the same as a Porsche 911 sports car.

However, so much power does not come cheap. Adrenaline junkies will have to splash out £20,000 to ride waves this fast.

Just 100 of the special edition models are being made by manufacturers 158performance.

They pack 100 brake horsepower more than the standard version.

Eight-time world jet ski champion James 
Bushell, who is a partner at 158performance, was the first rider to test
the new machine.

Christian Bryan, 42, from 158 Performance rides the speedy jet ski on Tattershall jet ski lake in Lincolnshire. The Black Edition is a 360BHP supercharged jet ski, capable of going 80mph

The limited production batch of 100 jet skis are expected to be sold to playboy customers including Arab billionaires. Designers say they have even received a request to repaint one of the jet skis to match the new owner's yacht

He said: 'It goes like stink and handles just like my race ski.

'It practically pulls your arms off - this isn't one for the weak-wristed.'

Although the Black Edition 360 is not technically the fastest-ever jet ski in a straight line, the makers claim its power while turning makes it the fastest overall so that it will bit be beaten on any race course.

A spokesman for 158performance, based in Lincolnshire said: 'This is our most exciting product ever.

'If you want to thrash everyone else on the lake or pose at the beach, this is the one for you.'

Earlier this month a Californian company called WaterCar has designed the world's fastest Jeep-style 
vehicle that can be driven straight from the land into the water and 
goes from a car to a boat in just 15 seconds.

Called the Panther, the vehicle can reach water speeds of up to 45mph - almost as fast as an average speedboat - and is fitted with a custom-made 3.7 litre V6 engine, fibreglass hull and lightweight chromoly steel chassis.

The amphibious vehicle is based on a Jeep CJ8 Scrambler and is also capable of reaching speeds of 80mph on land.
