It has been a week of tough political battles with fellow G20 leaders that has seen the Prime Minister launch more than one staunch defence of his 'small island'.

But David Cameron was given some respite this afternoon as he and Samantha attended her half-sister's country wedding.

Fresh from the G20 summit in St Petersburg, Mr Cameron was seen taking pictures on his mobile phone outside Sutton-on-the-Forest Parish Church near York following Alice Sheffield's wedding to Etienne Cadestin.

The Prime Minister wore a dark coloured suit with a blue tie and what appeared to be a cream buttonhole as he arrived arm in arm with wife Samantha.

She was pictured smiling in a pale pink fitted dress with a floral pattern.

Ms Sheffield once worked for Mr Cameron as a correspondence secretary and is the founder of green cosmetics website Bare Faced Cheek.

Her new husband, Mr Cadestin, is a senior sustainability and energy consultant for estate agents Knight Frank.

Mrs Cameron and her half sister are the daughters of baronet Sir Reginald Sheffield.

The wedding meant that Mr Cameron was unable to attend the Highland Games at Balmoral.

Traditionally the Prime Minister spends a weekend with the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh in September and it often coincides with the Braemar Gathering.

But Mr Cameron will instead visit the Queen's retreat later this month.
