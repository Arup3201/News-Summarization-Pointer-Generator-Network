Over 800 long lost love letters  documenting a remarkable long-distance post-war love story  have been discovered by a  husband and wife hidden in a dusty corner of their attic.

Lewis Caven, 25, and his wife Kerrie, 27, moved into the semi-detached house - which had previously stood empty for 18 years - back in 2010.

Spanning five decades the tender letters tell a story of a couple's long distance love as they navigate the difficulties of being apart in a time where letters took weeks to cross the globe.

Kerrie discovered the chest with her husband years after they had moved into the semi-detached house

The old trunk was found hidden in the roofspace last month when the couple started to clear out the attic in preparation for building an extension

The trunk contains over 800 hand written letters, telegrams, cards and notes between Henry and Moira 

The majority of the hand written notes are addressed to Henry Oliver Forbes who lived at the house before Lewis and Kerrie

It is believed the couple eventually married and then lived at the house until Henry died around 20 years ago

Builder Lewis and Kerrie were stunned when they found an old trunk hidden in the roof space last month when they started to clear out the attic in preparation for building an extension.

'Darling, Here we go again!

'Thinking of you more often as usual. Let me know how things are going with you?

'In case you get to the old good USA be sure to look me up. I had changed my address.'

The pair discovered around 800 love letters  inside the chest, as well as postcards, Christmas cards and even drawings. 

The majority of the hand written notes are addressed to Henry Oliver Forbes who lived at the house before Lewis and Kerrie.

They are penned by Moira Read, who lived in Newport, South Wales, with some of them sent from as far away as Boston and Los Angeles in America - as well as Germany.

The letters are dated from 1948 up until 1979 but there was also a set of Jewish prayer robes in the truck and an old canvas military sack with the name Henry Forbes printed on it.

In the moving love letters, Moira tells Henry she has missed him and often asks why he hasn't written for a few days

The couple are desperate to find any relatives of the couple to pass on the priceless romantic letters

Neighbours have told them his wife Moira went downhill after his death and put herself into care - leaving the house empty for 18 years before it was sold to pay care home fees.

Full-time mother Kerrie said she was desperate to find any relatives of the couple to pass on the priceless romantic letters.

'I've missed you an awful lot this week, darling and I wish I had you more to myself.'

She added: 'The house had been empty for 18 years when we bought it and it was just as it was left when she walked out the door.

'Her dressing gown was still on the bed and the dry cleaning was still in the bedroom. All their drawers were still full and there was food in the pantry.

'I think their grandchildren were involved in selling the house but they couldn't have been interested because the estate agent asked us if we wanted to clear the house out.

'We declined because it was too big a job and I think they just got some house clearing firm in.

'Lewis and his dad were up in the attic clearing it out for the extension when they found the trunk.

'My dearest Henry,

'This is a line so that you won't have to wait till Tues for a reply to your last letters.

'Yes darling, I didn't have your Thursday letter till yesterday morning and I had your little Friday note by the same post.'

'They brought it down to have a look and there was about 700 or 800 letters.

'We have had a flick through them and handpicked a few to read.

'Once they got married they obviously put them together because you have got both sides of the story.

'From as far as we can tell he was living here and she appeared to be living in Newport.

'All the envelopes are dated but we haven't got time to sit down and read all 800 letters in order.

'Long before the days of mobile phone text messages and emails this is how people expressed their love and you have to say it is much more romantic.'

'My darling Henry, 'm afraid I had only a minute or two to scribble a few lines last night' one letter begins 

The semi-detached house lay empty for 18 years after Henry died and Moira went into a care home 

Lewis, who lives with Kerrie and the couple's three children, added: 'We were starting to extend the house, so my dad and I went to clear out the attic.

'I'd been up there plenty of times before and never seen the trunk.

'My darling Henry,

'I thought I'd drop a line now to ask you when I can expect you darling.

'I believe you'll be coming Saturday morning as I have the day off, I'd like to meet you - if you let me know the time your train is leaving Birmingham.

'I packed a few presents last night - but had several interruptions - so that I still have some cards to do.

'I'll be hoping to hear tomorrow, darling. Look after yourself.

'All my love and lots of kisses, Moira'  

'The trunk was hidden right down in the eaves, wrapped in blankets.. It was as if no one wanted it to be found.

'I couldn't believe it when I looked inside and saw it was filled with letters, post cards and drawings.

'The dates on the letters go from 1948 up to 1979. I'm not too sure how far they go back, I didn't want to disturb them.

'Along with the trunk was a set of Jewish prayer robes.

'There was also an old canvas military sack with the name Henry Forbes printed on it.'

In the moving love letters, Moira tells Henry she has missed him and often asks why he hasn't written for a few days.

She also talks about meeting her lover for what appears to be the first time in a letter dated December 18, 1951.

'My dearest Henry,

'After I wrote to you last night, darling, I went home to find a parcel from you waiting for me.

'After I took off the first layer, I found the Xmas packing so I didn't want to open it any further.

'At first, you see, I thought you'd insisted on sending on some rations or something but when I saw the pretty paper, I decided you'd sent it on to save packing it.

'Today I was hoping for a letter but lunch-time I received another parcel! I was sure this was rations, but again I found fancy paper and I was afraid to open it.

'Darling, did you remember that I told you I always keep parcels till Xmas day? I wondered if that was the reason.

'However I began to wonder if I was doing right - so Mom peeped inside them both to see if there was a letter, but she couldn't find one. So you see I'm none the wiser!

'Thanks for your card, darling, it was a lovely one and a nice thought. How are you Henry?

'Cherio, my darling and all my love, Moira xxx'

Moira writes: 'This won't be a very long letter either but in case I won't have much time later, I thought I'd drop a line now to ask you when I can expect you darling.

'I believe you'll be coming Saturday morning as I have the day off, I'd like to meet you - if you let me know the time your train is leaving Birmingham.'

The Cavens believe Moira was last known to be living at a nursing home in Coventry and are hoping her family come forward to claim the long-lost letters.

Lewis said: 'I just want to return the letters to Henry's family.

'I know that if they belonged to my grandfather I would want them.

Kerrie added: 'We don't know where to start looking for their family.

'We hope somebody sees it because we wouldn't just throw them out.

'If the family didn't want them then we could give them to an art gallery or museum so they can go on display - they really are a fascinating insight into quite a remarkable love story.'
