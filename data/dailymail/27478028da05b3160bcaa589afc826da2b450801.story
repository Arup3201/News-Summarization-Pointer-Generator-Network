The murder trial of a neighbourhood watch captain, who shot and killed an unarmed black teenager, opened today.

Trayvon Martin, 17, was shot by George Zimmerman as he walked to meet his father in a gated housing estate in Sandford, Florida, after buying a soft-drink and sweets in February 2012.

Zimmerman claims he used his 9mm handgun in self-defence after being attacked by Martin but prosecutors argue he racially profiled the teenager.

Protestors stood outside the courthouse today at the opening of the trial and experts said it is one of the most polarizing cases in Florida's recent history.

Martin's death sparked demonstrations across the U.S. amid anger that police waited six weeks to arrest Zimmerman.

It also fanned a debate about race and Florida's controversial 'stand your ground' gun law.

Jury selection began today as the first group of 100 
potential jurors filled out questionnaires about their knowledge of the 
case.

Six jury members and four alternates will be chosen to sit on the 
trial, which is expected to last about six weeks.

They will be asked to decide if Zimmerman shot the teenager in self-defence.

Under Florida's 'stand your ground' 
law, Zimmerman, 29, could shoot Martin if it was 
necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm.

Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, claims he shot Martin with his 9mm pistol in self-defence after the teenager broke his nose in a fight.  

However, prosecutors will argue that 
the volunteer neighbourhood watch captain shot Martin at the Retreat at 
Twin Lakes gated community after racially-profiling him.

They say Zimmerman pursued and confronted the teenager after reporting a 'suspicious male' to police.

Thousands of people across the country joined rallies and protests with many wearing a hoodie like Martin was when he was shot.

Trayvon Martin's parents Tracy Martin, second right, and Sybrina Fulton, said they have faith in the justice system

The death of the teenager, who was unarmed, sparked protests across the U.S.

The Rev Al Sharpton said at the time that activists were planning a ‘wave of civil disobedience' and said it is important to show ‘sustained indignation’ over Martin's death.

Black Panther Party also offered a $10,000 reward for Zimmerman’s ‘capture'.

Elsewhere, hundreds of thousands of dollars was donated to Zimmerman to pay for his defence.

Florida officials were braced today for scores of protestors outside court, but fewer than expected turned up.

The teenager's father Tracy Martin said he was relieved the trial was starting and called for calm during proceedings.

He said: 'We
seek a fair and impartial trial. We ask that
the community continue to stay peaceful as we place our faith in the 
justice system.'

The family unsuccessfully tried to get the state's stand your ground law changed.

Zimmerman's
brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr, said his family was confident that 
prosecutors would not meet the burden of proving the neighbourhood watch 
volunteer was guilty of murder.

He called the charge 'improper' and said charges were filed for political reasons.

He said: 'You
don't charge in this country simply to assuage the concerns of masses.

'Unfortunately, a political calculation was 
made, centred around the politics of race and the law was defiled.'

The case has split the local community and extra security has been put in place around the courthouse.

A number of attempts to diffuse racial tension have also been implemented.

Local pastors from various faiths will sit in on the trial to report back to the community.

Dr Vibert White, an associate professor of history at the University of Central Florida and an expert in African American studies, told The Guardian: 'This is one of the most polarising cases Florida has seen in recent memory.'

Judge Debra Nelson today denied a request by the defence to delay the trial.

The judge has said she will keep the 
identities of the selected jurors anonymous but she rejected a defence 
request to hide the identities of the entire jury pool of 500 residents.

She has yet to decide whether 
voice-recognition experts will be allowed to testify on a 911 tape 
recorded during Zimmerman's confrontation with Martin.

His defence team do not want the experts to testify.

Neighbours called 911 during the fight and cries for help can be heard on the recordings.

Martin's family claim the cries came from the teen while Zimmerman's father has testified they were those of his son.

About a dozen people protested outside the Seminole County Courthouse in Sandford, Florida, at the opening day of the trial.

Relatives of Oscar Grant, a man who was fatally shot by police officer in Oakland, California, were among the demonstrators.

Cephus 
Johnson, Grant's uncle who flew in from California, said he wanted to 
stand with Martin's family at the start of the trial.

'We know how important it is to be embraced by families who have gone through the same things,' Johnson said.
