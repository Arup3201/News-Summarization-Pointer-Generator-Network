The MoD has been warned that it faces 'a global storm of protest' after it unveiled plans to build homes for soldiers near Stonehenge.

Outraged experts claim that the houses would block the world-famous solstice sunrise at the Wiltshire monument.

Army bosses want to build 4,000 homes for soldiers and their families returning from Germany on an old airfield overlooking the monument, but experts said the buildings would occupy the exact spot that the sun peeks over the horizon on the longest day of the year.

It’s an event that’s watched by some 20,000 people and leading archaeo-astronomer Simon Banton predicted there would be uproar if the plan goes ahead.

The Stonehenge guide said when the airfield, at Larkhill, was built in 1910, military chiefs left a gap for the sunrise and bosses should similarly respect the ancient monument.

He said: ‘Stonehenge is the focus of a World Heritage Site of enormous cultural importance.

Controversy: The MoD wants to build houses on a site that experts say is directly in line with the summer solstice sunrise

Stonehenge was built and rebuilt over 600 years in three main phases. The first - begun in 3000BC - saw the creation of a ditch and bank which later enclosed a circle of 56 holes for posts or stones.

Around 2600BC the site was transformed into two circles of 82 blue stones brought from the Welsh mountains.

Then, 150 years later, the ancient Britons set up 50-ton sarsen stones quarried at Marlborough, 25 miles away.

There are dozens of theories about Stonehenge's purpose.

At least 52 bodies were cremated and buried at Stonehenge, leading some experts to conclude the site was used for elaborate funerals. Some believe the monument was a centre of medicine with the circle's creators believing the Welsh blue stones had magical powers. The human remains on the site belong to sick people who came to be cured.

Others think it is a calendar and observatory as the stones are aligned with the summer and winter solstices - the longest and shortest days of the year. The site, they say, would be used to predict eclipses and to mark lunar cycles.

Meanwhile, believers in New Age superstitions claim Stonehenge is a centre of mystical lines of energy that cross Britain. Believers in alien life say Stonehenge was a landing site for flying saucers.

‘It is internationally famous, instantly recognisable and the solstitial alignment of the monument is intrinsic to its original purpose.

‘To propose building across this alignment invites a global storm of protest from groups as diverse as heritage bodies, astronomers, prehistorians, UNESCO, religious orders and the wider public.

‘The MoD needs to demonstrate that it is fully sensitive to the World Heritage Site in order to avoid the potential outrage and reputational damage, not only to itself but also to Britain in the eyes of the world.

‘When Larkhill Aerodrome was first established in the early 20th Century, a series of aeroplane sheds was built along the east side of Wood Road.

‘These early military and civilian aviators were keenly aware of their responsibility and so a wide space was deliberately left between the aeroplane sheds at the north end and those further south in order to allow the Summer Solstice sunrise to continue to shine unobstructed down to Stonehenge.’

He said the gap is already partially obstructed by a copse of tall trees which the Army should also remove to completely restore the sightline from Stonehenge to the horizon.

He added: ‘This possibility will be entirely removed if the sites are built upon.’

English Heritage and UNESCO is understood to be considering Mr Banton's report before commenting, but Wiltshire Museum bosses agreed with the expert.

Curator David Dawson said: ‘Today, if you look towards the horizon there are some trees but even in 1910 when there were some air hangars built they left a gap between them so that you could still see the sunrise.’

Pagan leader King Arthur Pendragon, 59, vowed to fight any development that would threaten Stonehenge.

'I oppose completely,' he said. 'I will be the first person blocking it if they decide to go ahead with the plans.

'Obviously I understand there is a need to build these houses but there is no need to build them in the way of the light.

'What you've got to remember is that around 30,000 people descend here every summer for the solstice.

'All they need to do is alter the plans just ever so slightly. The sunrise has been observed for thousands of years - everyone appreciates that and therefore they haven't threatened that.

'For the sake of building a few miles away it would be tragic to destroy something so important to so many people.

'I will oppose anything that threatens Stonehenge.'

The MoD is currently holding a consultation on the massive expansion of the army bases to the north and east of Stonehenge.

It disputes that the project will affect the site.

An MoD spokesperson said: ‘The MoD is not considering any development that will affect Stonehenge.

'We are aware of concerns about the proposed development in the Larkhill area and will be meeting with all interested parties to address these issues.'
