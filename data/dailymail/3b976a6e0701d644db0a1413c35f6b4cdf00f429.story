A 'treatment tax' should be imposed on alcohol bought in shops to turn round soaring levels of drink-related hospital admissions, a think tank close to Iain Duncan Smith has said.

The Centre for Social Justice said wine, beer and spirits bought in off-licenses and supermarkets should be subject to a levy of a penny per unit to fund rehabilitation for alcoholics.

It would mean that a the price of bottle of wine, which contains around 10 units, would rise by 10p. A pack of four beers would rise by a similar amount - with pints of low-strength beer going up by 2p.

The think tank, which was set up by the Work and Pensions Secretary before the election, said action was needed because the number of alcohol-related hospital admissions have risen to more than 1.2million a year.

New figures reveal that admissions in England rose by more than 5 per cent over the space of two years.

But critics will question why ordinary responsible drinkers should be hit in their pockets to fund treatment for the irresponsible.

Christian Guy, the director of the CSJ, said: 'Alcohol abuse can rip into families, make communities less safe and entrench poverty.

'This is a growing problem but for years effective treatment has been the preserve of the wealthy. It's time to break this injustice wide open and fund a new generation of rehabilitation treatment.'

The CSJ said the figures show alcohol abuse is an increasing burden on society and public services – and called for a new 'treatment tax' to be levied on off-licence sales to fund rehab.

Data shows the number of admissions rose from 1,168,266 in 2010/11 to 1,232,464 in 2012/13, the latest statistics from the Department for Health highlight.

Analysis from the CSJ has found that, going on recent trends, the number of cases could reach as much as 1.5 million by the time of the election.

Public spending cuts since the election mean that residential treatment – the most effective form of 'rehab' treatment – has suffered from reductions in spending.

The think tank said these cuts should be reversed, and said the 'treatment tax' would be an effective way to afford this.

The levy would be added to off-licence alcohol sales to fund rehab for people with alcohol and drug addictions. Under the scheme, a tax of a penny per unit would be added by the end of the next Parliament to fund recovery services to the tune of £1.1billion over five years.

The CSJ was also critical of a lack of prosecutions of individuals serving alcohol to people who are drunk.

There were only 29 convictions in England over the five years from 2009 to 2013. In the last recorded year there were five. The think tank called for Police and Crime Commissioners to put more resources into cracking down on those who sell alcohol to drunks.

Around 1.6million people are estimated to be dependent on alcohol in England and one in five children live with a parent who drinks hazardously. Every year alcohol is said to cost society £21billion.

The CSJ said that as much as 70 per cent of accident and emergency visits in the early hours are alcohol related, and 40 per cent of A&E attendances at weekends are caused by alcohol.
