A Chinese mother chained her son to a balcony to punish him for stealing her electric motorcycle to drive around a car park with friends.

A-Qiong Ho works as a receptionist at a hotel in the city of Langzhou in China's south-western Sichuan Province.

She said that after her husband left the family when the boy Xiaolong was just five years old she had struggled to discipline him and hold down a job to pay their bills.

She finally had enough when she discovered the keys for her electric motorcycle had vanished and the bike had gone as well as her son.

She told local media: 'I thought he was doing homework and when I couldn't find my motorcycle keys to go to the shops, I went to ask him and found he was gone as well.

'I couldn't really do anything but wait until he came back several hours later. 

'He came just before I was due to start my shift, and I didn't have any opportunity to punish him properly or discipline him. 

'I didn't want him going back out again, so I came up with the idea of chaining him to the balcony.

'I told him I would only free him when he had done all his homework when I came back.'

However, shocked neighbours who spotted the boy in chains alerted police who entered the property to free the teenager.

When the mother returned, she was ordered to go to the police station to collect him and to explain her actions.

On learning however that his mother faced jail and that he could end up in a home, the boy promised officers that in the future he would try and be better behaved. 

His mother also promised the punishments would not be so harsh.

She admitted: 'I suppose didn't really think about what would happen if for example there was a fire or something.

'But having a child with so much energy who was so naughty is sometimes just too much.'
