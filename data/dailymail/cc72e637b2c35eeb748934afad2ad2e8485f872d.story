A mother has claimed her five-year-old daughter has been molested by two classmates for a second time at kindergarten.

The alleged victim, a student at the school in Pennsylvania, told her mother last week that the boys put their hands down the back and front of her pants.

The assault is alleged to have happened in the cafeteria at Fawn Primary Center, in Allegheny County, CBS12 in Pittsburgh reported.

The names of the mother and child are being withheld because of the nature of the matter.

Fawn Township Police Chief Timothy Mayberry confirmed the mother filed a report with police on Thursday afternoon before taking her daughter to be examined at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.

The mother said she received a call from the principal Ian Miller saying: 'This isn't the first time this has happened.'

Speaking to CBS12 in Pittsburgh, the mother said: 'If this isn't the first time, why wasn't something done before? We send our children to school 
thinking they're safe, and clearly that wasn't the case.

'I understand that they're busy and 
there's a lot of students and we can't watch them all all the time.

'But, had something been done prior - weeks or months or 
however long this has been going on - this with my daughter could have 
been prevented.'

Mr Miller said his department is assisting the Highlands School District with the investigation.

A spokeswoman from the district said she had no comment on the allegation.
