Taking the trip to the top of Falcon’s Fury, the new tower ride at Busch Gardens in Tampa, is one of the most scenic experiences in Florida.

It is 335ft tall and the outward-facing seats provide a stunning view over the park and its surroundings, all the way to the distant sunshine-laden horizon.

But then the Fury kicks in. Riders are tilted forward, 33 storeys above the ground, and you realise the only way down is, well, down – at 60mph.

On top of the world: Falcon’s Fury is the first drop tower of its kind in the world and it offers breath-taking views of the Tampa area 

That, of course, is the full adrenaline-filled purpose of Busch Gardens’ brand new attraction, which soars into the sky like a multi-coloured colossus and offers those brave enough to try it the most thrilling ride in the Sunshine State. It’s brief, but absolutely exhilarating.

Falcon’s Fury is the centrepiece of the park’s revamped Pantopia area. It used to be called Timbuktu but everything has been freshened up, with new buildings, new architecture, landscaping, dining options and a hilarious show, Opening Night Critters, featuring a variety of creatures rescued from local animal shelters.

Not everyone will be brave enough to face the Fury, so Pantopia features rides and games for the less adrenaline-inclined. 

But even if you don’t ride it, Fury offers great entertainment as it’s almost as much fun to watch people’s reactions as it is to plunge face-first on the ultra-smooth scream machine yourself.

Taking the plunge is also the signature experience of SeaWorld’s Orlando water-park, Aquatica, which debuted another high-level fright-fest this summer in the shape of Ihu’s Breakaway Falls.

Aquatica features all manner of family rides and flumes, but Breakaway Falls is another one for thrill junkies.

It consists of a set of three capsules that drop riders vertically into enclosed body-slide water chutes.

It is imaginatively set up so all three pods face each other, and there is a 3-2-1 countdown – complete with pounding-heartbeat sound effect before riders take the plunge in random fashion, one after another. 

You never know who will be first to drop, which adds to the excitement.

After the breathtaking initial drop, during which everyone screams hysterically, there is then another 400ft of high-speed slide to enjoy on the way to a final splashdown.

This is a ride that’s unique in Florida – and one that is also fun just to watch.

This year marks SeaWorld’s 50th anniversary as the most popular marine park in the world. The milestone is being marked with a Sea Of Surprises celebration all year, which includes new live entertainment, special animal encounters (notably with some of their rescued animals) and their own Surprise Squad, handing out prizes and special gifts for different park experiences.

The major announcement for the future involves a redevelopment of their killer-whale habitat to create a vast environment – the Blue World Project – that will showcase whales in an engaging new way, and create the world’s largest underwater viewing area.

At the same time, SeaWorld is extending its array of marine rescue and conservation programmes with a $10 million fund into killer-whale research that will promote ocean health and eco-awareness.
