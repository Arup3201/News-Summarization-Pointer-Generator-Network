Chelsea captain John Terry took to Instagram on Friday to boast about a straight sets table tennis win against Sportsmail columnist and former Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp.

Such was Terry's desire to show off his 21-16, 21-17 win over his pal Redknapp, the Blues defender made the effort to film part of the match using his CCTV set-up at home.

Terry posted: '@jamieredders popped round for a game of table tennis today and got tucked in 21-16 21-17 and thought he got away with no video until I got the CCTV up when he left.'

Redknapp also seems to have been caught out making excuses for the defeat as Terry added '#swapendsthesunisinmyeyes' suggesting the Sky Sports pundit wasn't happy with his view.

The former England captain was enjoying some downtime ahead of Chelsea's huge Premier League clash against Manchester City on Sunday.

Blues boss Jose Mourinho confirmed on Friday that star striker Diego Costa would be fit to start the match at the Etihad.

He said: ‘Diego is not in the best condition but he will start the game. His attitude is amazing. Clearly, we have to try and protect him until he is completely fit.

‘What we can do to improve the situation, we have to do when he’s not playing. He needs work, not just from the medical department but also on the pitch and in the gym.’
