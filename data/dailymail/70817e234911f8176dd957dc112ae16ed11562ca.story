Steve Jobs asked his former girlfriend for tantric sex in the garden shed after returning from a trip to India - but refused to climax because he wanted to conserve his energy for work, she has claimed.

Chrisann Brennan added that they 'shared nights of lovemaking so profound that, astonishingly, some 
fifteen years later, he called me out of the blue to thank me'.

Brennan, who dated the late Apple boss for five 
years until she became pregnant with their daughter Lisa, has shared the 
intimate details in a new book due out this month, 'The Bite in the Apple: A Memoir of My
 Life With Steve Jobs'.

The couple began dating in 1972 and two years later, he visited India - and returned a changed man.

During the trip, he came across a religious gathering, shaved his head and experimented with drugs. He then left for the U.S., giving all his money to his travel companion.

After he returned, 'it all broke open between us when he asked if I would make tantric love with him in his garden shed,' Brennan writes in the book, as quoted by the New York Post.

But she added that she refused because they were not spiritually prepared for the experience.

She said that he returned from the trip with a sexist attitude towards women and 'started to reject the feminine aspect as inferior to the glorious masculine'.

This extended to their sex life, she explained.

Opening up: Brennan (left with their daughter Lisa) has written a book (cover pictures above) about her five-year relationship with Jobs. They split aged 23 when he learned she was pregnant

Married: Jobs wed Laurene Powell, right, in 1991 and they went on to have three children together

'Our birth control method up to that 
point was Steve’s coitus interruptus, also called the pull-out method, 
which for him was about his conserving his energy for work,' she wrote.

He explained that he didn't want to climax so he could build 'power and wealth by conserving one’s vital energies'.

Child: He also accepted his daughter, Lisa Brennan-Jobs, and paid for her to attend Harvard

She
 was concerned about their lack of contraception and was fitted with an 
IUD - but fell pregnant within the following 24 hours when their 
lovemaking was 'truly kinder', she said.

But when, at 23, she told him that she had fallen pregnant, 'Steve's face turned ugly. He gave me a fiery look,' she wrote. 'Then he rushed out of the house without a word.'

He refused to talk about the child and 'told me he felt like I was stealing his genes', she said. The couple broke up in 1977.

He went on to deny that the child was his - but in 1979, a paternity text proved that Lisa was indeed his daughter. Afterwards, he agreed to pay $500 a month support.

He later accepted his daughter and paid for her to attend Harvard. She now works as a journalist.

In 1983, he cruelly told Time magazine that '28 per cent of the male population in the United States could be the father'.

After
 he agreed to the meager child support, Apple - which he had built up 
while living with Chrisann - went public weeks later, making him 
millions of dollars.

Jobs married Laurene Powell in 1991. The couple had three children together before his death from cancer in 2011.

The Bite In The Apple: A Memoir Of My Life With Steve Jobs is due out October 29.
