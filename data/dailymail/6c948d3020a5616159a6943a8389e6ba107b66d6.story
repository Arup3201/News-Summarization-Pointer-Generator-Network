Police are investigating whether a father slashed his daughter's throat before killing himself in his car over a hundred miles away from his home.

Gary Volkers, of Holland Township, Michigan, was found dead in his car on October 5 as the result of a gunshot wound.

When authorities arrived at his house later that day they found his daughter, Stacey Grotenhuis, dead as the result of a laceration to her neck.

An autopsy determined that Grotenhuis had already been dead for a day when her body was discovered. 

It is not certain if Volkers' gunshot wound was self-inflicted State Police First Lt. Chris McIntire told Michigan Live.

That being said, according to Lt. McIntire, 'On one hand we're not looking for (any suspects), but on the second hand we're not ready to call this a murder-suicide.' 

Grotenhuis, 31, had just moved back to Michigan following a breakup and was taking care of her father following eye surgery, living with him at the Crystal Waters condominium.

On his Facebook page, Volkers even had a video of his daughter making him chicken soup just days before this tragic incident occurred, writing, 'The girl feeds me good!'

Grotenhuis' mother, Karen Jarrell, said the two two were close and even praised Volkers.

'He was a wonderful father,' she said  of the 59-year-old.

Lt. McIntire said investigators are awaiting DNA analysis before making any definitive statements about what transpired.
