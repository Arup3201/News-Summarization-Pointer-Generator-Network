A barrister who is 19 weeks pregnant escaped from the Sydney siege only to hear the heartbreaking news that her friend and colleague had tragically not survived.

Julie Taylor worked with another barrister Katrina Dawson, 38, at Eighth Floor Selborne chambers in Phillip Street near to where the hostage crisis took place inside the Lindt Chocolat Cafe. 

It is believed that the two were getting coffee together in the cafe when Man Haron Monis, 49, entered and suddenly brought Sydney to a standstill.

Taylor survived the terrifying ordeal only to later hear the devastating news that her colleague at the law firm and mother-of-three, Dawson, 38, had suffered a heart attack and died in hospital after the siege.

Taylor, 35, is in hospital being assessed. She is in a stable condition.

During the hostage crisis Taylor had been chosen by Monis to give a speech on a chilling video outlining his demands. 

'I'm Julie Taylor. I'm a barrister in Sydney. This is a message for Tony Abbott,' she said.

'I ask for three simple things. That Tony Abbott calls him (the hostage taker) to have a short conversation if he does that five of us will be allowed to go. We can't understand why that hasn't happened. 

'The second is that he wants the politicians to announce the truth – that this is an attack by Islamic State on  Australia. And if that is done two of us will be allowed to go.

'The third is that he wants an Islamic State flag delivered to us here, and if you do that then one of us will be allowed to go.'

Taylor looked tired and drained, but composed as she made the speech. 

She gave it in front of a black and white Shahada flag held up by another hostage. The video lasted 44 seconds. 

The barrister specialises in commercial law and was admitted to the NSW Bar in 2007. 

She studied at the University of Western Australia and was admitted to practice as a lawyer in 2005. 

Just before all hell broke loose in the cafe Taylor was able to escape with two other hostages and they ran towards police with their arms raised.

Fifteen minutes later police stormed the Lindt Chocolat Cafe in a hail of bullets.

 In the aftermath it was revealed that although Taylor had survived her colleague Dawson had not been so lucky.
