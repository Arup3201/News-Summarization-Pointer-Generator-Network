They are officially classed as twins, but three-year-old Alessia and her sister Lara Deleo do not share the same birthday.

Instead of being born minutes or even hours apart, the sisters entered the world 16 days apart - a feat obstetricians say is incredibly rare.

Parents Linda and Nick Deleo, both 38, had no idea there would be any delay with the birth of their twins girls.

But when they went to the Women and Children's Hospital in February, 2010, they were told there would be more than two weeks between the births of their daughters.

Alessia was born 26 weeks prematurely while her sister Lara followed 16 days later to be born 23 weeks prematurely.

'My waters leaked and broke with Alessia first but they just stayed intact with Lara and the labour stopped,' Mrs Deleo said.

'The doctors decided the main aim was to keep Lara in there as long as possible to help her grow.

'I stayed in hospital the entire time and got steroid injections to help the baby's lungs get stronger. The doctors did seem surprised it went on for so long and in the end I had a caesarean.'

Alessia was born on February 2 and spent 15 weeks in hospital while Lara arrived on February 18 and spent 13 weeks in hospital - meaning the pair could go home together.

To cope with having two birthdays in such close proximity, they Deleo family holds a big party in between the two while the girls each have their own smaller celebration on the actual day of their birth.
