A lifelong rocker took the stairway to heaven when he was laid to rest in a guitar shaped coffin.

John Graham - a former guitarist with 1960s rock band The Ramrods - was buried in a 12ft long white replica of a Fender Stratocaster.

Workers at Beechwood Funeral Services spent months creating the coffin - modelled on John’s favourite guitar, which he was given as a present aged just 15.

Hundreds of mourners attended the funeral service at St Andrew’s United Reformed Church in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, yesterday.

His widow June, 63, of Whiteway near Stroud, said the coffin was the most fitting tribute for her beloved husband.

She said: 'His whole life was playing the guitar, he was the most wonderful man you could wish to meet.

'I was with him for 20 years and he never said a bad word to me all that time. But we had such laughs together.'

The funeral was packed as friends, family, fellow band-mates and fans - all dressed in black and white - remembered the guitar obsessed rocker.

The hour-long service, led by Reverend Maz Allen, was full of music and memories of the popular grandfather-of-five, known affectionately as Johnny.

Cliff Richard tribute band The Shadow of Cliff, led by Jimmy Jemain, played a number of Johnny’s favourite songs, including Travelling Light, Born to Rock and Roll, Only Angel, and Johnny Be Good.

His body entered the church at 12.45pm to Apache and left to Wonderful Land by Hank and Bruce.

The congregation laughed and cried as they remembered technology-phobe Johnny, who hated anything electronic.

Rocker: John, far right, worked at a tax office by day and spent many of his evenings performing gigs

In a tribute read out by Rev Allen on behalf of June, she compared John to John Cleese, stating that his constant accidents reminded her of him.

In another fitting tribute, the limousine used by family members originally belonged to Dr Jim Marshall, creator of Marshall Amps.

John was born and raised in Cheltenham and joined his first band, Johnny and the Falcons, when he was just 18.

The group supported stars of the time such as Screaming Lord Sutch, Joe Loss, Shane Fenton, the Barron Knights and Mike Berry.

Gigs: John joined The Ramrods in 1963 and travelled all over the country supporting bands

The rocker worked at a tax office by day and spent many of his evenings performing gigs.

He was invited to join The Ramrods in 1963 and travelled all over the country supporting bands including the Animals, Johnny Kidd and the Pirates, and Gerry and the Pacemakers.

In 1967, The Ramrods went their separate ways when founding member Phil Crowther choked and died on honeymoon.

But the band continued to play gigs and it was during a rehearsal 20 years ago that June and John met.

June explained: 'They had got together to play for the drummer’s 50th birthday.

Disease: John, who died aged 67, was diagnosed with a brain tumour and then lung cancer

'A friend of mine who knew the band invited me along to one of the rehearsals. I’d had a little too much to drink and so John offered to drive me home.'

The couple moved to a farm near Stroud 15 years ago and there John continued to make records using vocals performed by his wife.

But in 2001 John was diagnosed with a brain tumour and he defied the odds until he was struck down with lung cancer. He died last month aged 67.

'He was given five years to live but he managed to beat the odds,' said June. 'Then he got lung cancer 14 months ago and it was that which killed him.

'It was a hard 11 years on him but he was a strong individual. He played all through his illness and only stopped six months ago.'
