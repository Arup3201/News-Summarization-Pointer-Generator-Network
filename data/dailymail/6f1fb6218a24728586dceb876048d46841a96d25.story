An overweight cat survived being shot at with an airgun after the pellet became lodged in his rolls of fat, missing his vital organs by just inches.

Vikki Starkess, from Sleaford, Lincolnshire, found her pet cat Kahn, who weighs 1 stone 2lbs, in a distressed state when she arrived home from work last month. 

The rescue cat was licking and washing himself uncontrollably and when Miss Starkess, 32, inspected him she discovered a small round bullet wound in his fur - caused by an airgun.

A Lincolnshire cat survived after being shot at with a gun pellet after the bullet became lodged in his rolls of fat. Owner Vikki Starkess, said that the fact that her cat Kahn was 'a bit fat' saved his life

She rushed the cat for emergency surgery, costing £450, but vets were baffled when they failed to find the pellet despite cutting through his stomach and searching through his intestines in case it had caused internal bleeding.

The mystery was eventually solved when they discovered the pellet lodged in the cat's rolls of fat.

They were even more astonished when they realised the fat had prevented the metal pellet reaching his internal organs - thus potentially saving his life.

Miss Starkess, whose fiance is called Gavin Hoare, said: 'The vets had to cut him open into his 
abdomen - they thought it could be in his intestine or liver - they 
ended up cutting open his stomach from top to bottom.

'It’s lucky he loves his food - the fact that he’s a bit fat saved his life.'

Vets are now hoping the pellet stays lodged in the piece of fat so that the risk of lead poisoning remains 'minimal'.

But Miss Starkess was left with no choice but to dip into money that she had saved for her wedding to fund Kahn's surgery.

Describing the ordeal on February 22, she said: 'Kahn was acting funny, he was licking and washing uncontrollably - there was no blood but he was skulking up the stairs - I knew something was wrong.

An x-ray carried out by vets showed a bullet lodged inside Kahn's upper body

'I looked him over and found a perfectly round hole, I rushed him to the vets immediately, I was terrified.'

Kahn is still being monitored by vets to make sure that he does not develop lead poisoning.

Miss Starkess said: 'It makes me feel sick right down to my stomach that someone could harm an animal like that.

'If your animal gets hit by a car or natural disease it is heart-breaking, but it is life. You don’t expect someone to shoot your cat.

'It is just pure evil.'

Miss Starkess said that the actions of the thugs who targeted Kahn were 'pure evil'. She urged other owners to check their cats for small pellet wounds if their animal becomes unwell

She now hopes that other owners in the area will stay vigilant and check their pets for small pellet wounds if they become unwell.

Miss Starkess said: 'If you say a cat has been shot you expect a big bullet wound and pouring blood, but it just isn’t. If it is left too late there is nothing they can do.

'It goes in and sits there, and potentially they can end up with lead poisoning.

'We have been very lucky with Kahn, and hopefully he will go on to make a full recovery. '
