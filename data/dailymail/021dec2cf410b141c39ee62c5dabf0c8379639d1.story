Adrian Lewis sensationally hit a nine-darter on Tuesday — only the eighth achieved in the 20-year history of the PDC World Darts Championships — yet somehow contrived to lose to an inspired Raymond van Barneveld.

Players often hit nine-dart finishes in practice but then struggle to repeat the feat on the main stage in front of a live audience.

Yet, in the fifth leg of the first set, two-time world champion Lewis gave the 2,500 capacity crowd a memorable moment by hitting two 180s, treble 20, treble 19 and double 12 with nine perfect darts.

However, as is sometimes the case, the person who accomplishes such a wonderful feat suddenly loses focus and concentration. Lewis missed one match dart in the sixth set to move into the quarter-final and the Dutchman punished him, completing a 4-3 victory with his sixth match dart.

'What a game,' said an exhausted Barney. 'After he hit the nine-darter, I thought: 'Hold on, is this the standard?'

'But he struggled to hit his trebles or big shots afterwards. I don't know what to say. I'm so happy. I never gave up and I took my chances.'

For once, this was a darts contest that lived up to its billing. This was the first time the two tungsten titans, with seven world titles between then, had met at this level and while the doubles ratios were poor given their respective calibre, there was plenty of drama and tension on offfer. It was undoubtedly the best match of this tournament.

'It was my own fault,' Lewis said. 'I hit a nine-darter on the stage and then also in the warm-up during the break. But that's no consolation. I played well enough to walk off 4-0. He got away with it.'

Phil Taylor reached the world championships quarter-final for the 20th time in 22 years following a feisty 4-3 victory over Kim Huybrechts.

Though the pair embraced at the end, Taylor was visibly unhappy throughout with the Belgian's wild histrionics on the stage whenever he hit a checkout.

But the Power possessed greater class and guts when it mattered, coming from 2-1 and 3-2 down to prevail in the final set.

Taylor, who now plays Vincent van der Voort in the last eight on Friday, said: 'Kim was full of beans, giving it large after every big shot. He seemed to throw more right-handers than Nigel Benn in celebration. But I knew that I have been there before, Kim hasn't, and that was the difference.'

In the first match of the afternoon session, Peter Wright thrashed Andy Hamilton 4-0 despite suffering from dreaded 'man-flu'.

'Snakebite', who was defeated by Michael van Gerwen in the 2014 final, has been struggling with a cold since the Christmas break. 

'I got a bit of man-flu at the moment,' said the Scot. 'I got it yesterday and I'm glad the match did not go any further. All my right side was totally numb the whole night as I slept on it — now I'm going to have a Lemsip.'

Wright, the No 5 seed, will face Gary Anderson (No 4) in the quarter-finals. Despite a painful tooth abscess, the 'Flying Scotsman' overcame the Spanish preliminary qualifier Cristo Reyes 4-1.
