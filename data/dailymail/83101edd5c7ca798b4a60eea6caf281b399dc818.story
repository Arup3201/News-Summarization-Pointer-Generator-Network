The number of Britons arrested abroad for drug offences has increased, with a massive 68 per cent rise in drug arrests in Spain.

There were 708 cases of Britons arrested for drug offences overseas in the 2013/14 holiday season - an increase on the figure of 669 in 2012/13.

Of
 the cases, 173 were in Spain - a 68 per cent rise on the 2012/13 figure, according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The shock figures come after warnings about the party drug known as Cannibal, which increases aggressiveness in the extreme and has become popular in the Balearic islands this summer.

A British man has been arrested for biting bathers on a beach in Magaluf following his alleged use fo the drug, with multiple other holidaymakers hospitalised in recent weeks after using the substance, which is often sold online as bath salts.

Spanish police believe Cannibal is being sold in nightclubs after a large shipment arrived on the islands.

And detectives in Ibiza's party resort of San Antonio claim dealers have been peddling the mind-bending narcotic to young revellers.

Reporting on the arrest figures in Spain for drug use over the past year, the FCO said it believed the rise was due to a crackdown by police.

The second-largest number of drug arrests involving Britons last year was in America, with 102 cases.

But this was a 29 per cent fall on the 2012/13 American total.

Overall, the FCO said drug arrests were low last year compared with previous years.

There were 816 cases in 2011/12, 799 in 2010/11 and as many as 994 in 2009/10.

Despite the rise in drug arrests, the number of arrests for all offences involving British nationals abroad fell fractionally from 5,435 in 2012/13 to 5,418 in 2013/14.

The FCO figures for 2013/14 involving Britons abroad also showed that the number of Britons needing hospital treatment fell from 3,599 in 2012/13 to 3,157 in 2013/14.

There were also 106 cases of rape compared with 138 in 2012/13, with last year's figure being the lowest recorded for 10 years. And the number of reported sexual assaults also dropped from 172 to 152.

But there were 31,134 cases of lost or stolen passports and the need for emergency travel documents last year - a rise on the figure of 28,783 in 2012/13.

The most cases where Britons needed consular assistance in 2013/14 were in Spain, followed by the USA, Thailand, France and Greece.

Comparing the number of visits made to a country with the number of assistance cases required, the Philippines was the country where British nationals were most likely to need assistance, followed by Thailand, Jamaica, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan.

The FCO said as a proportion, British nationals remained significantly more likely to die in the Philippines than in any other country.

It added: 'This is due to the large number of elderly British expats who live there, a group which continues to account for most of the hospitalisation or death cases.

'Relatively few tourists die or are hospitalised.'

Although total arrests were down last year, there were rises in cases involving Britons in the Philippines, Egypt and France.

Consular Affairs Minister Mark Simmonds said: 'With the summer holidays just around the corner, millions of people across the UK will be looking forward to taking a trip abroad. The vast majority will enjoy a trouble-free holiday, but for those who do encounter difficulties our consular staff are there to offer support.

'This year's report has highlighted some encouraging downwards trends, and this allows our staff to concentrate more on supporting our most vulnerable customers. However, the FCO continues to help thousands of British nationals who get into trouble overseas every year.'

He went on: 'Not all consular cases are preventable, but for many travellers taking a few simple steps of preparation can reduce the risk of getting into trouble.

'Taking out comprehensive travel insurance, researching the country and health risks before you go and behaving responsibly when you arrive can all help to ensure that you remember your holiday for the right reasons.'
