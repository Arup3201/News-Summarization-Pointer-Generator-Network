Decision: Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke announced that the progression towards a stronger economy is taking longer than originally expected

Wall Street had their best day hitting record highs on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve announced that they would continue to support the economy by keeping interest rates high and buying billions of government bonds.

American stocks jumped as a result with
traders predicting that the fact that the central bank will  continue 
pumping $85billion into the economy every month could lead to inflation.

The announcement of the continued financial support came as a major surprise, as many believed the Fed would begin winding down their emergency measures that were initially launched five years ago during the financial collapse.

Fed chairman Ben Bernanke said on Wednesday that wanted to wait for more evidence of solid economic growth before beginning to reduce the country’s bond purchases.

He went out of his way to stress the program was 'not on a pre-set course’ even though in June he had said the Fed expected to cut back before year end.

'There is no fixed calendar schedule. I really have to emphasize that,' he told a news conference.

‘If the data confirm our basic outlook, if we gain more confidence in that outlook ... then we could move later this year.'

The reaction in markets was swift and sharp: the U.S. dollar fell to a seven-month low against major currencies and the price of gold, a traditional inflation hedge, soared more than 4.0 per cent and investors responded by propelling U.S. stocks to record highs and driving down bond yields.

Yields on U.S. Treasury debt had risen over the summer on expectations the Fed would cut back its $85billion a month in bond purchases that have been the cornerstone of its efforts to spur the economy.

Share price rise: U.S. S&P500 index shot up 15.66 points to 1720.42, the highest level in its history and the Dow Jones rose 108.09 to a record 15,637.82

Some economists said it was possible the 
Fed might not begin to wind down its bond buying until after Bernanke's 
term as Fed chairman expires in January.

That would leave the tricky task of 
unwinding the stimulus to his successor, quite possibly Fed Vice Chair 
Janet Yellen who was identified by a White House official on Wednesday 
as the front-runner for the job.

Bernanke declined to comment on his own future, beyond saying he hoped to have more information soon.

Bernanke
had stated in June that officials expected to begin slowing the pace of
bond purchases later this year and would likely end the program by 
mid-2014, at which point the central bank forecast the unemployment rate
would be around 7.0 per cent.

In
his statement on Wednesday, he said a jobless rate of 7.0 per cent was 
not a 'magic number' that would govern when the Fed would turn off the 
monetary spigot.

'We could 
begin later this year. But even if we do that, the subsequent steps will
be dependent on continued progress in the economy,' Bernanke said.

'We don't have a fixed calendar schedule. But we do have the same basic framework that I described in June.'
