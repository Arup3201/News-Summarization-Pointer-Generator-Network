They've been banned at some middle schools, with officials deeming them unsuitable and 'distracting' to boys.

But a new sales report has determined that leggings have started outselling denim jeans - possibly for the first time ever - among American teenagers, as both fashion and comfort herald them 'the new pant'.

Leggings and yoga pants were ranked the most popular trend among female teens this spring, according to a semi-annual study released this week by financial services firm Piper Jaffray.

And those figures are not exclusive to you girls, with Nike ranked as the No. 1 brand among teen boys, The Huffington Post reported.

The new jean: Young American girls especially are increasingly wearing leggings or tights in lieu of actual pants. Now a new sales report has shown leggings and sweat pants are the biggest-selling pant at the moment

Leggings and yoga pants were ranked the most popular trend among female teens this spring, according to a study released this week by financial services firm Piper Jaffray. Nike was the No. 1 brand among teen boys.

Popular: There has been much debate, especially among school staff and parents, whether leggings qualify as proper pants. Traditionally they were considered undergarments

The tried and tested staple of denim jeans were nowhere to be found on the list, after years of consistently ranking as a top 10 trend.

Teens now prefer 'Athleisure', with workout wear no longer confined to the gym but considered fashionable for everyday use.

Designers have labeled the look 'sports luxe', and it has trickled from international runways into trends spreading across all ages.

According to Piper Jaffray, winning the sales war at the moment is Lululemon, a brand centered around yoga clothes.

Losing the battle are big teen retailers like Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle, as well as Levi's and Wrangler.

The report could be signalling a step away from the style of low-cut jeans, which have been popular for years.

Lululemon helped pioneer yoga pants as leisure wear and quickly rose to the forefront of the stretchy pants movement, as yoga became more mainstream.

Its success attracted the eyes of both mass-market retailers and athletic clothing companies.

Chief executive Laurent Potdevin even admitted last week that his chain is 'not the only game in town anymore'.

Gap entered the fray by acquiring activewear seller Athleta in 2008, and it is now exanding aross the country, opening stores alongside Lululemon's.

Nike, Under Armour and Adidas refused to be left behind, touting their own lines of pliable pants and tank tops that can be worn throughout the day and at the yoga studio.

Piper Jaffray also found that teens are now spending more money on food than clothes.

Earlier this month Haven Middle School in Evanston, Illinois, barred girls from wearing leggings or yoga pants to school.

The school said the clothes are considered undergarments, not proper school wear, and that leggings in particular had become 'distracting' to boys.
