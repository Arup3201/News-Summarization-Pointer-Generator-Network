Increasingly popular: The word 'sex' is now more common than it was in the Swinging Sixties

If the words we use every day reveal anything about our society, then gone are the days of handkerchiefs, handwriting, soup and suppers.

Welcome instead to the new world of mortgages and movies, celebrity and sex.

Researchers have ranked 2,500 of our most commonly used words  and compared them with the same list from 50 years ago.

Linguists at the University of Lancaster used computers to trawl through millions of books, speeches, studies and newspaper articles currently in circulation.

They found ‘marriage,’ ‘childhood,’ ‘God’ and ‘religion’ all fell in popularity but ‘Christmas’ was on the up.

And although ‘modesty,’ ‘conscience’ and ‘gentleman’ are no longer in vogue, ‘sex’ and ‘celebrity’ are far more common.

Project leader Dr Vaclav Brezina said: ‘We wanted to create a vocabulary baseline for the English language.

‘However, our list, when compared with the original one, reflects the changes in society over the past few decades; what we talk about and, particularly, write about.

‘What we have found is that there remains a fairly stable core of vocabulary but some words are no longer frequently used while others have become salient.

‘There’s greater use of informal terms – such as ‘guy’ - even since the early 1990s and, of course, sex is now publicly discussed far more often that it used to be.

‘It’s also really interesting to see old words develop new meanings as society and technology change. For example, ‘net’, ‘web’ and ‘user’ all now have computer-based connotations.’

The original GSL was published in 1953 to help foreign students learn English.

Teacher and researcher Michael West collated what he believed to be the 2,000 most frequently used and relevant words in the language.

The list was later extended to 2,284 entries in 1995 to incorporate derived words, such as ‘marriage’ from ‘marry’.

Now the Lancaster University team has studied several giant collections of English texts totalling 12 billion words, all written over the past five decades and currently in circulation.

Living in sin: Both 'God' and 'religion' as well as 'marriage' have dropped in popularity over the past 50 years

And the new GSL – published in the journal Applied Linguistics - has arrived at the 2,500 most commonly used.

There is little difference at the head of the list with an identical top five of ‘the’, ‘be’, ‘of’, ‘and’ and ‘a’. However, elsewhere, there are telling changes in words’ positions in the list.

Sex equality has left its mark with ‘man’ dropping 62 spots to 105th while ‘woman’ has risen 34 places to 198th. ‘Family’ may have risen 55 places to 216th but ‘husband’, ‘wife’, ‘marriage’ and ‘childhood’ are all big fallers.

Also disappearing are words redolent of times past, such as ‘dear’, ‘servant’, ‘hunger’, ‘coal’, ‘mill’, ‘pencil’, ‘tin’, ‘bless’, ‘plough’, ‘handshake’, ‘telegraph’, ‘comb’, ‘grammar’ and ‘gaiety’.

New to the GSL though are ‘mobile’, ‘internet’, ‘CD’, ‘guy’, ‘climate’, ‘video’, ‘technology’, ‘drug’, ‘text’, ‘online’, ‘computer’, ‘television’, ‘traffic’, ‘cancer’, ‘email’ and ‘environment’.

‘Good’ has been displaced as the most common adjective by the word ‘other’ while ‘same’ is also a sharp riser.

Katherine Connor Martin, head of US dictionaries at Oxford University Press – which publishes the Oxford English Dictionary – welcomed the new GSL.

She said: ‘There is often a tendency to regard language change in a negative light, as if each change is taking us further away from the original, real or correct way of using English.

‘But our language is constantly evolving and it always has been. Some changes are driven by social, cultural, and technological developments, but others have more elusive origins.

‘Change ensures that the work of lexicography is never done: new words are always being added and the usage and meanings of existing ones are always changing.’
