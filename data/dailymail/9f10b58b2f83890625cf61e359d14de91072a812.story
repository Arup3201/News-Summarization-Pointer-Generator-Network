A woman who fell overboard from a cruise ship with her boyfriend off the coast of Australia had spoken of her excitement about the holiday in her final tweet just days before.

Kristen Schroder, 27 and Paul Rossington, 30, are feared to have died after falling over the side of the Carnival Spirit liner into the Tasman Sea - 75 miles off New South Wales.

They had been captured on CCTV arguing in the ship's casino before they plunged from its 65ft-high deck last Wednesday.

In her final message on Twitter, Ms Schroder wrote: 'Gotta pack for the cruise!!! Cannot wait for the down time with the family! It's going to be awesome to have the most important people in my world around me for 10 days.'

Fall: Paul Rossington, 30, and Kristen Schroder, 27 were arguing on the Carnival Spirit liner hours before they fell from the ship off the New South Wales coast

It has been reported that the couple, from Barraba near Tamworth, had 
skipped an arranged dinner with Ms Schroder's family, who were also 
travelling on the Carnival Spirit.

Ms Schroder's 
brother-in-law Sascha Percuoco has said neither was intoxicated at the 
time. In a posting on his Facebook page - reported by ABC News - Mr Percuoco said he was upset to read that  Kristen had ' jumped off the Carnival Spirit cruise ship willingly.'

'I want to make one thing absolutely clear,' he said, 'neither of them had been 
drinking and I do not for one minute believe Kristen would take her own 
life.'

He said Ms Schroder had 'lost her grip and slipped backwards' from the ship's railing,' according to ABC News, and that he believes Mr Rossington 'jumped in to save her without having a chance to think clearly and call for help.'

Senior police sources revealed that 
CCTV footage showed Ms Schroder fall from the ship first, with her 
paramedic boyfriend following. Further footage shows her hit a lifeboat before her body hit the water.

The couple had been travelling with a group of friends and family on the Carnival Spirit liner. A massive sea and air search was held after their disappearance.

Authorities were said to be looking at the 
theory that Miss Schroder fell first and her panic-stricken boyfriend 
then jumped in to try to save her. Security footage on the ship is said to 
show the pair falling overboard from the mid-deck of the boat as it 
travelled down the New South Wales' mid-north coast just before 9pm 
local time on Wednesday.

Holiday: The couple was on holiday with a group of seven relatives and friends when they went missing on Wednesday night

Initially police were unable to 
determine who had fallen into the sea first, but after the footage had 
been enhanced, they could see that it was estate agent Miss Schroder who
plunged first from the 65ft-high deck, followed about 20 seconds later 
by her boyfriend.

They were reported missing 12 hours 
later after the boat had docked at Sydney's Circular Quay at the end of 
its 10-day cruise. Staff noticed the couple had failed to collect their 
luggage when the rest of the 2,680 passengers disembarked.

Survival expert Dr Paul Luckin said 
if the couple, from Barraba, near Tamworth in NSW, had survived the 
impact of hitting the water, fatigue would be their biggest problem. Dr 
Luckin, who advises the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said
he would not expect anyone to last as long as three days after falling 
from a ship.

He told the Sydney Herald: 'If you're stuck in the water and constantly being hit in the face by water, that is tremendously fatiguing.

'It will certainly be under three days that you would expect somebody to survive without water in those conditions.'

Mr Rossington, a paramedic, and his 
girlfriend had been on holiday on the cruise around the Pacific Islands 
with a group of seven relatives and friends. Their cabin on the ship remains sealed off while forensic officers inspect it, although the ship did set sail from Sydney on its next cruise at 6.30pm last night.

Inspection: Police combed the cruise ship while it was berthed at Sydney's Circular Quay before it set sail again

NSW police marine area commander Mark
Hutchings said the couple's fall was not believed to be suspicious, and
officers were inspecting the ship's CCTV footage.

He said: 'It’s very unclear, but it does depict one person going over and then a short time (later) another person going over.'

The ship was about 120km (75 miles) off the coastal town of Forster when the couple plunged into the sea.

A statement released by Carnival 
Cruise Lines said: 'As part of our standard protocol, a full ship search
was conducted as well as examination of closed circuit video.

'There
is indication from the shipboard video of what transpired. There is no 
evidence of foul play.  However, out of respect for the families, we are
not going to publicly disclose the details of what occurred.'

Search: Authorities had carried out a massive sea and air search for the missing couple after they fell overboard

The Carnival Spirit liner set sail again last night on another cruise, but the couple's cabin remained sealed off

The firm's spokesman said the rails on the cabin balconies are higher than the required standard.

Carnival Cruise Lines, operated by Miami-based Carnival Corp, has been beset by a 
series of problems and onboard crimes including power outage, rape, 
sickness and theft.

Several lawsuits have been launched against Carnival - but whether complainants will have any success is doubtful as the cruise company has a legal structure that shields it from big-money lawsuits.

Many passengers will have unknowingly signed Carnival's contracts prohibiting them from class action lawsuits, while the small print also bans them suing on the grounds of emotional distress.
