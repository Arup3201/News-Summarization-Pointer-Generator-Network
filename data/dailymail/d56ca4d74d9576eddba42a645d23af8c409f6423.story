The saying goes that you are only as old as you feel. 

But what mobile phone you own, the television programmes you watch and whether or not you have a Facebook page might also keep you youthful, according to new research.

Owning an iPhone, watching reality television and beating younger relatives at games are just some of the secrets to keeping young, it emerged today.

Silver surfer: Surfing the internet could make you feel younger according to the survey commissioned by Benenden Healthcare

And silver surfers, those who spend more time with their grandchildren or trying to catch the eye of someone younger tend to feel more alive.

The study of 1,000 over 50’s found the secrets of youth the older generation rely on - with having regular sex, fancying a younger celebrity and knowing what Twitter is all likely to give a burst of life.

The research, which was commissioned by healthcare specialist Benenden, found that age really is just a number with the average person claiming their youth secrets lead to them feeling 18 years younger than they are.

Many of the 'older' generation thought staying up past midnight led to feeling alive, while eating spicy food and keeping in touch with the local gossip are guaranteed to keep a person fresh.

Using smartphone apps, eating chocolate and having a younger partner all appeared to keep many an over fifty in good nick.

Nine in ten or those surveyed thought that how old you feel as a person mostly depends on your outlook and attitude to life with 70 per cent also saying it’s crucial to laugh regularly.

Generation gap: Spending time with the grandchildren is key to keeping youthful for many over 50s

The average respondent was aged 59 - but the age people actually felt was 18 years younger at 41.

And sometimes feeling young means not always playing by the rules - four in ten describe themselves as rebellious, with more than a quarter saying they’ve received ‘a telling off’ while in their fifties.

In fact, it seems forty per cent of over fifties have trespassed somewhere and a quarter admits they’ve broken the law since hitting half a century.

Paul Keenan added: 'Of course, it’s not so much about feeling young as it is about feeling content in life and making time to do the things that make you happy.

'It can be a serious world and sometimes we can get wrapped up in it too much so it’s important not to lose sight of what keeps you feeling good about yourself.

'Whether that’s dancing, keeping tabs with what’s deemed ‘trendy’ or simply enjoying games with younger relatives, taking time to remember what you enjoy about life is crucial to approaching it in the right way.'
