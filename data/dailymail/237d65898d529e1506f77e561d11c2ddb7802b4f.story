A police chief has condemned his own force for letting a house burglar off with a warning.

Jim Barker-McCardle, Chief Constable of Essex Police, said he was ‘staggered’ by the officers’ decision to give a caution for the offence and has launched a misconduct investigation.

Ireneusz Blaszczyk broke into the house in Essex in November last year, stealing cash, belongings including jewellery and cameras and unwrapping the family’s Christmas presents.

The 23-year-old Pole handed himself in after a police appeal but, despite confessing to the burglary, was offered a caution – meaning he would not face trial.

Homeowner David Cable said: ‘We want a bit of justice. The guy broke into our house, ransacked it and didn’t even get a fine.’

Mr Barker-McCardle has referred three of his officers to the force’s Professional Standards Department, sent case files to the CPS and written to the local branch of the Magistrates’ Association.
