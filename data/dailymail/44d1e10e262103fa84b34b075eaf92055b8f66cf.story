Theresa May has pledged to scrap the Human Rights Act if the Conservatives win the next election

A Conservative government will scrap the Human Rights Act if they win they next general election, the Home Secretary has said.

Speaking in front of Tory activists, Theresa May said the party could go even further by pulling out of European obligations on rights altogether.

She said the party must 'consider very carefully our relationship' with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), suggesting it was restricting Britain's ability to act in the national interest.

She pointed to the case of radical preacher Abu Qatada, who was today ordered to remain in custody following his arrest for allegedly breaching his bail conditions, accusing Strasbourg of constantly moving the goalposts on his deportation.

Ms May, who is being touted as a possible future Tory leader, told the Victory 2015 conference staged by website conservativehome, that Britain must stop human rights laws interfering with its ability to protect the nation.

The confirmation comes after speculation last week that the Cabinet minister wanted to pull the UK out of the ECHR.

Ms May said today: 'We need to stop human rights legislation interfering with our ability to fight crime and control immigration.

'That's why, as our last manifesto promised, the next Conservative government will scrap the Human Rights Act, and it's why we should also consider very carefully our relationship with the European Court of Human Rights and the convention it enforces.

'When Strasbourg constantly moves the goalposts and prevents the deportation of dangerous men like Abu Qatada, we have to ask ourselves to what end are we signatories to the convention?

'Are we really limiting human rights abuses in other countries? I'm sceptical. But are we restricting our ability to act in the national interest? Are we conceding that our own Supreme Court is not supreme?

'I believe we are. So by 2015 we'll need a plan for dealing with the European Court of Human Rights. And yes, I want to be clear that all options - including leaving the convention altogether - should be on the table.'

Mrs May said the case of hate preacher Abu Qatada, who was denied bail at his latest hearing today, highlighted the need for Britain to change its human rights laws

Ms May also told Tory grassroots at the London conference that she expects the Conservative's public sector reform agenda to 'become even more radical' and could include allowing companies to make a profit delivering frontline services.

The wide-ranging speech, which also touched on industrial revival and banking, is likely to be viewed as a marker of intent by the Home Secretary about possible future leadership ambitions.

More private companies and charities should be brought in to run public services to improve quality and end the 'monopoly' of the state, which is too often a 'poor provider', Ms May said.

She added: 'In future, I expect our reform agenda to become even more radical. Yes, the state should make sure that public services are available to all and free at the point of use.

'Yes, the state should regulate those services to make sure they're provided everywhere and offer high standards. But too often the state is a poor provider of services, and its monopoly over the delivery of those services must end.

'A future Conservative government should therefore go further in increasing the number of charities, companies and co-operatives that deliver frontline services. And if allowing those organisations to make a profit means we have a more diverse supply side and better outcomes, then that is something we should consider with an open mind.'
