A new video reveals the dramatic moment that police swarmed George Zimmerman's car and ordered him to get down on his knees before taking him into custody following an altercation with his estranged wife on Monday.

The video, recorded by a police cruiser's dash cam, surfaced Tuesday as Zimmerman's lawyer revealed he would no longer represent him, despite the possibility that Zimmerman could face charges resulting from the dispute with his wife.

When police arrived on the scene of the argument, which had allegedly turned violent, Zimmerman was in the driver's seat of his car.

Police ordered him out of his car and shouted for him to raise his hands, turn around and walk backwards toward them.

By the time he appeared to be about 20 feet away, police shouted 'Get on your knees! Lock your feet!'

Zimmerman dropped to his knees and two officers approached, one with his gun drawn, while the other handcuffed him.

Then several other officers ran toward the house where the dispute allegedly took place. The video was first reported by TMZ.

Mark O'Mara, who represented Zimmerman when he was acquitted of murder in the death of Trayvon Martin, made his shock announcement that he would be leaving his client as police continued their investigation into the warring couple.

Police said they are now looking at an iPad belonging to Shellie Zimmerman to see if footage on the device sheds any light on the cause of their altercation in Lake Mary, Florida on Monday. It could be used to bring charges against either of the couple.

The iPad captured video of the dispute but because it was smashed, it needs to be examined in a crime lab, Lake Mary police spokesman Zach Hudson said.

Shellie called 911 on Monday saying her husband had punched her father in the nose and was threatening them with a gun. But she later changed her story and decided against pressing charges.

No gun was ever found and Zimmerman claimed it was his wife who was the aggressor. The spat came just days after she filed for divorce, claiming their marriage was irretrievably broken.

Friends told MailOnline the argument began over claims Zimmerman had been having an affair with his ex-fiancee.

On the 911 call, Shellie also claimed Zimmerman had smashed her iPad and now invetsigators say it could be crucial evidence in determining whether any charges are filed.

'The iPad video is going to be paramount in this case,' Hudson said.

When
asked who could be charged, Hudson said: 'As of right now, it 
could be either one or it could be no one. It depends what that iPad has
on it, what that footage shows.'

Authorities
are also looking into whether surveillance video from cameras at the 
house captured the dispute, and Shellie added on the 911 call
that a city worker witnessed the spat.

Zimmerman's attorney, O'Mara,
said that his client did nothing wrong but added that he was no longer going
to represent Zimmerman due to their impending divorce.

'I've come to know them as a family, and it's not a good idea to get in between them,' O'Mara said.

O'Mara will continue to be Zimmerman's
lawyer in a defamation suit pending against NBC and in the remaining 
motions from the Trayvon Martin trial.

ABC
News reported that O'Mara appeared to struggle with his anger at his 
client during Monday's incident when he arrived at the home.

During a press conference, O'Mara was asked if he had any advice for Zimmerman, and he responded: 'Pay me.'

The
encounter Monday was the latest in a string of events for Zimmerman. He
has twice been pulled over on suspicion of speeding and ticketed once. 
He also appeared in photos at a gun maker that were published online and
he helped members of a family from their vehicle following a car wreck.

Shellie
Zimmerman had collected most of her belongings from the house where she
and her husband had been staying until she moved out.

On Monday, she 
returned unexpectedly to gather the remaining items, and emotions got 
out of control, O'Mara said. Neither side pressed charges and no one was arrested.

'I
know the 911 tape suggests that Shellie was saying something but I 
think that was heightened emotions,' O'Mara said.

'There may have been 
some pushing and touching. That happens a lot in divorce situations. ...
Nobody was injured.'

Florida law allows police officers to arrest someone for domestic violence without the consent of the victim. Police will either forward charges to the State Attorney's Office or make an arrest.

Hudson added that an arrest is possible today, depending on what the iPad video shows.

He said that investigators do not
believe a gun was involved in the incident, even though Shellie had 
described her husband making threats with his hand on one.

We searched him ... there was no weapon,'Hudson said, adding: 'As of right now, a gun is not a part of the equation.'

George
Zimmerman has been involved with a domestic case at least once before.

In 2005, Zimmerman's former fiancee filed for a restraining order 
against Zimmerman, alleging domestic violence. Zimmerman responded by 
requesting a restraining order against his then-fiancee.

In
an interview with ABC's Good Morning America that aired last Friday, 
Shellie Zimmerman said her 29-year-old husband
is reckless and feels invincible.
