Andy Murray can still remember the jeers and boos which rang out the only time he played his next French Open opponent, Philipp Kohlschreiber.

It was at Monte Carlo in 2010 and Murray was in one of his prolonged post-Australian Open slumps — still trying to get over the fact that he could not clinch a Grand Slam title, having fallen short in the  Melbourne final.

Murray was so poor that he managed only three games on that sunny Riviera afternoon. ‘At the beginning of the clay-court season I’ve had some tough matches over the years, it just wasn’t a pleasant memory for me,’ said Murray.

Eyes on the task: Andy Murray will take on Philipp Kohlschreiber in the third round at Roland Garros

Fast forward four years and two of those craved-for major titles are in the bag plus an Olympic gold.

So it is sure to be a different version of the 27-year-old Scot that Kohlschreiber encounters in this third-round meeting which is scheduled to be fourth on court in the early evening.

What happened in Monaco has limited significance today, but the world No 24 should provide a good test and is dangerous for Murray. The German has yet to drop a set this week and the more looping style of ball he hits means there will be few mistakes for the British  No 1 to benefit from.

Murray said: ‘He’s a quality player. He’s had big results here before, beating Novak Djokovic in 2009  and winning last week. It’s going to be a very tough match for me so I’ll need to play well because when I played him before when I didn’t play well, it was a pretty quick win for him.’

Kohlschreiber, who won the pre-Roland Garros ATP event in Dusseldorf, once worked with Murray’s ex-coach Miles Maclagan, which is one of their few connections.

On that eternal subject, Murray also offered further illuminating thoughts over why he believes a female coach such as Amelie Mauresmo might be right for him.

‘When you get a lot of men in a room, there’s often quite a lot of egos and communication can be difficult because not everyone listens,’ he said. ‘When there’s an argument it can get heated rather than everyone staying calm. In those situations, women can listen a bit better and take things on board easier than guys.

‘From a 
communication point of view, it would be pretty good. Whether it’s a man
 or a woman, when they look at the game, it’s just important that they 
see the differences in the two games — like in women’s tennis, the serve
 isn’t as important as in the men’s game.

‘In women’s matches, you need to start incredibly quickly. And in a best-of-five-set match, you need to pace yourself more.

‘So
 there are things but so long as the person understands that, they can 
easily work with both: a man can work with a woman or a woman can work 
with a man.’
