A professor has been
suspended and could be fired after his inappropriate and insensitive joke about
the Aurora, Colorado shooting during a class, with a student in attendance who
lost his father in the deadly tragedy.

Gregory Sullivan, who teaches at
the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, New York, made the egregious crack
on July 31, when he dimmed the classroom lights in preparation for
watching a film.

‘If someone with orange hair
appears in the corner of the room, run for the exit,’ Sullivan remarked,
according to an internal university document obtained by The New York Times, referencing James
Holmes, the suspect in the July 20 shooting, who has bright orange hair.

Sick humor: U.S. Merchant Marine Academy professor Gregory Sullivan has been suspended after allegedly making an off-color remark in class about the Aurora, Colorado shooting

Seated in Sullivan’s humanities
class that day was Weston Cowden, a native of Aurora, Colorado, whose father Gordon who was among the
12 victims killed in the Colorado shooting, according to WCBS-TV.

After Sullivan’s comment, Cowden left the room ‘visibly
upset,’ according to the internal document. His fellow students
informed Sullivan of Cowden’s family loss and the professor immediately
apologized to Cowden and also expressed his regret to the entire class.

Remembering the victims: The prof denied knowing one of his students, Weston Cowden, had lost his father in the tragedy

But Shashi Kumar, the school’s academic
dean, called Sullivan’s joke ‘notoriously disgraceful conduct’ and recommended
that Sullivan be fired.

Sullivan was informed of the dean’s recommendation on
August 10 and has 10 days to contest his dismissal. He has been
suspended with pay in the interim.

‘I find there is no lesser sanction to effectively address this misconduct’
than dismissal, Kumar wrote.

Grief: Weston Cowden's father Gordon, 51, was killed in the theater massacre on July 20. His two daughters (in an undated family photo) were also in the theater but survived the rampage

Sullivan, who joined the school’s
faculty in 2006, denied he knew a student in his class had a connection to the tragedy.
But the school said that a campus-wide email had been sent out in late
July and Sullivan had also reportedly excused absences for students who
traveled to Colorado to attend the funeral for Cowden’s father.

After the deadly massacre, Weston
Cowden appeared on CNN and spoke with Anderson Cooper about his father, who was
at the movie theater that fateful night with his two daughters. Both daughters
survived the incident.

‘My dad taught me what it was to be a man,’ Cowden told Cooper on July 26. ‘He
was a father first, last, and always.’

Shock: James Holmes is the chief suspect in the July 20 shooting at a theater in Aurora, Colorado. The rampage left 12 dead and 58 wounded

‘The world’s a worst place
without him, he brought so much life,’ he said about his 51-year-old dad,
adding, ‘He lived life like it was supposed to be lived.’

A spokesman for the Cowden family
told KUSA-TV, that they would not be commenting on the classroom
incident.

The United States Merchant Marine
Academy is one of the five U.S. federal service academies and has roughly
1,000 students currently enrolled. It trains officers to join the military or work
in the transportation industry.

The civilian academy, located near Great Neck, on Long Island, is run by the
U.S. Transportation Department and faculty members are federal employees.
