A diver has died after being pulled from the water off the NSW Central Coast and suffering a cardiac arrest.

The experienced diver was 30 metres below the surface off the Terrigal coast on Sunday morning when a friend noticed her struggling.

She was part of group diving off the HMAS Adelaide.

Dive location: The HMAS Adelaide was scuttled off the NSW Central Coast three years ago. 

A friend of the 33-year-old diver dragged her to the surface with an emergency ascent.

Members of the diving group pulled the woman on board the dive boat and carried out CPR.

The woman, from Bronte in Sydney's east, was taken to hospital and treated for the bends - a decompression sickness suffered by divers where bubbles form in the blood stream due to changes in pressure.

She died in Prince of Wales Hospital on Sunday afternoon.

Artificial reef: The HMAS Adelaide was scuttled off the coast in April 2011.

Now a reef, the HMAS Adelaide has become a popular dive location.
