The parents of 
Trayvon Martin have refused a 'self-serving' request by their son's 
killer to meet him ahead of a bond hearing today where is expected to 
plea for his release from jail.

Tracy
Martin and Sybrina Fulton have not ruled out meeting George Zimmerman 
in the future, but are wary of his motives at this time, their lawyer 
said.

'There may be a time 
and place for that, but not now,' said Justin Campbell, an assistant to 
family attorney Benjamin Crump, in an emailed statement late yesterday.

'We believe (the) Zimmerman request is
very self-serving, considering the timing of it 50 days later, right 
before his bond hearing.'

He
said that Zimmerman has never apologized on his website or on 
voicemails that he left friends or expressed remorse during interviews 
with authorities.

'With Zimmerman now making this request, the family questions his motives and sincerity,' he added.

Meanwhile, Trayvon's parents attended a town hall meeting at the Beulah Baptist Institutional Church in Tampa yesterday where they were offered condolences from a 400-strong crowd over their loss.

Zimmerman admits shooting the 17-year-old during a confrontation in February, but claims self-defence under the state law, which eliminates a person's duty to retreat under threat of death or serious injury.

Legal experts say the
neighborhood watch volunteer stands a good chance of being granted bail
at today's hearing despite being charged with the second-degree murder.

Whether Zimmerman is allowed to 
leave the county as he awaits trial - and how he would remain safe - are
two questions likely to be at the center of the hearing at the Seminole
County Criminal Justice Center.

'Although
it's not routine for people charged with murder to get bond, they do 
get bond, and I think there is an excellent argument to be made in his 
specific case for him to be released on bond,' said defense attorney 
Randy McClean, who practices in Seminole County, about 15 miles 
northeast of Orlando.

Zimmerman
has several factors in his favor. For one, he has ties to the local 
community including family members who are expected to testify by 
telephone on his behalf at Friday's hearing.

He
turned himself in voluntarily after second-degree murder charges were 
filed against him last week, a good indication that he doesn't pose a 
flight risk.

He has never been convicted of a crime, which suggests that he doesn't pose a threat to society, legal experts said.

'It's
hard for a prosecutor to argue he will leave, when up to this point he 
has been cooperative and everyone knows who he is,' said Stacey 
Honowitz, a veteran prosecutor in Broward County.

A spokeswoman for special 
prosecutor Angela Corey's office said she wouldn't comment on whether 
Corey would object to Zimmerman being released on bond.

Zimmerman's safety weighed on the mind of his defense attorney right after he took on the case last week.

Mark
O'Mara indicated he would ask that Zimmerman be allowed to leave the 
area, if he is granted bond, because of those concerns.

Circuit
Judge Kenneth Lester was assigned the case Wednesday after a previous 
judge recused herself because of a potential conflict of interest.

'Normally, the conditions are that you stay local. I think that is going to be difficult,' O'Mara said in an interview.

'I
think nobody would deny the fact that if George Zimmerman were walking 
down the street today, he would be at risk. That is a reality.'

O'Mara has also said he would prefer that Zimmerman be released so he can assist in building a defense case.

The
judge would have discretion to allow Zimmerman to live elsewhere along 
with a number of restrictions such as a curfew, regular reporting 
requirement and possibly an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet, said 
Florida International University law professor Joelle Moreno.

'That
would be the kind of low-cost agreement between Zimmerman and the court
that might make sense, so we're not talking about police protection for
an extended period of time,' Moreno said.

O'Mara said he would ask for assistance from law enforcement.

Kim
Cannaday, a spokeswoman for the Seminole County Sheriff's Office, said 
she couldn't comment on what security procedures will be in place for 
Zimmerman if he is released.

The
sheriff's office does have the ability to monitor defendants outside 
the county if a judge requests a GPS monitor to be used as a condition 
of release.

'I want him to 
be safe,' O'Mara said. 'I want him to get to his trial so that a judge 
or jury, or the prosecutor and I, can figure out a way to resolve this.'

There
is only so much that law enforcement can do to help protect Zimmerman, 
though, if he is released from jail, said Michael Grieco, a former 
Miami-Dade County prosecutor who is now in private practice.

'There is no mechanism in which a defendant is entitled to an around-the-clock detail,' Grieco said.

'The
irony is that the only safe place for him, considering the current 
atmosphere surrounding the case, is protective custody within the jail 
system.'

Jail inmates are separated from other inmates when there is a belief they could face threats.

Zimmerman
has been in protective custody since he entered the Seminole County 
jail more than a week ago after turning himself into authorities.

Witnesses
in cases involving violence or threats are frequently afforded 
protection, but police officers and prosecutors have no special 
responsibility to protect Zimmerman once he is out of jail, said 
Jennifer Zedalis, a University of Florida law professor and former 
public defender in Gainesville.

'If he gets out, the primary responsibility to protect Zimmerman would be on Zimmerman,' Zedalis said.

Scene: The encounter which led to Trayvon's death took place on the secluded walkway on the right of this picture of a gated community in Sanford, Florida

Zimmerman
is charged with second-degree murder in the 17-year-old Martin's death 
during a February 26 confrontation in a Sanford, Florida, gated 
community.

Martin was 
walking home from a convenience store when Zimmerman spotted him from 
his truck and called police to report him as suspicious.

Zimmerman
has claimed self-defense under Florida's 'stand-your-ground' law, which
eliminates a person's duty to retreat under threat of death or serious 
injury.

The lack of an 
arrest for 44 days spurred protests nationwide, several in Seminole 
County, in which participants chanted and held signs that said, 'Arrest 
Zimmerman Now!'

Anger 
over a delay in Zimmerman's arrest led to the Sanford police chief 
stepping down temporarily and the recusal of the prosecutor who normally
handles cases out of Sanford. Sanford city officials were holding a 
town hall meeting Thursday to address some of the residual anger from 
the case.

Under typical 
bond conditions, Zimmerman would likely have a curfew, be prohibited 
from contacting Martin's family and not be allowed to consume alcohol 
and non-prescription drugs.

He also may be required to wear an electronic monitoring device, which he would most likely have to pay for.

Even
if Zimmerman is granted bond, his family may not be able to afford it, 
given that it generally can range from $10,000 to $100,000 for a 
second-degree murder charge.

Zimmerman's
parents are retired, and their house in Lake Mary, Fla., is valued at 
just under $120,000, according to the Seminole County Property 
Appraiser.

'They are not a family of means, so that is going to be difficult,' O'Mara said.
