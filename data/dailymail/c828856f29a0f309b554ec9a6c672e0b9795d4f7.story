Controversial former Toronto mayor Rob Ford was welcomed back to the city's council last night despite battling a rare form of cancer.

Mr Ford was replaced as mayor of Canada's largest city after his term in office was plagued with scandals involving public drinking and crack cocaine use.

He was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year and announced in September that he wouldn't be seeking re-election as mayor.

Former mayor Rob Ford, left, was welcomed back to Toronto City Council last night after stepping down as mayor following his cancer diagnosis  

But despite his illness, he opted to seek a suburban seat on the City Council, where he first launched his political career and gained a faithful following that became known as Ford Nation.

He won his old seat with a landslide victory and took his place in the council chamber last night where he greeted new Toronto mayor John Tory.

Mr Tory then declared a motion to thank Mr Ford for his public service, which passed unanimously and the pair then shared a fist bump.

The 45-year-old began his fourth round of treatment on Monday and avoids shaking hands to keep himself from exposure to germs during chemotherapy.

The 45-year-old former mayor was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in September and doctors have told him he only has a 50 per cent chance of survival  

He was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer of the abdomen, called malignant liposarcoma, and has said that doctors have told him that he only has a 50 per cent chance of survival.

After months of denials, Mr Ford acknowledged in 2013 that he had smoked crack cocaine in one of his 'drunken stupors,' but he refused to resign.

The City Council stripped him of most of his powers but lacked the authority to force him out of office because he wasn't convicted of a crime.

Ford's antics made him the target of late-night television comedians in the U.S. and last March, he appeared on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' after months of wooing by the talk-show host.

Mr Ford's appearance at the City Council chamber comes just weeks after he revealed he would be selling off his remaining 'Robbie Bobbie' bobblehead dolls to raise money for the hospitals that have been treating his cancer.

Supporters can buy the collectors' items at the mayor's office for $26 each with the proceeds going to support two hospitals, Humber River Hospital and Mount Sinai Hospital.

Last week hundreds of Ford's supporters began lining up outside his office, hours before the pale former mayo showed up to sign the bobbleheads.

The 45-year-old politician was visibly unwell, struggling to speak and keep his eyes open.

Toronto's new Mayor John Tory stands in the council chamber during his inauguration ceremony in Toronto yesterday. He has been described as a straight-laced, button down moderate conservative 

'I am not myself,' he was quoted by CTV as telling reporters. 'I'm still doing phone calls, still going out, taking care of my constituents. I haven't gotten my fire in my belly yet. I have to get that back. I really want to get that back.'

Meanwhile Mr Ford's successor Mr Tory, has been described as a straight-laced, button down moderate conservative.

He has previously said that said he will restore trust and faith in the office and vowed during the campaign to end the circus at City Hall and to get people moving with a new public transit plan.
