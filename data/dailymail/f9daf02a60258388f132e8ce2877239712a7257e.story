Tottenham midfielder Christian Eriksen has admitted he wasn't at the races last night for Denmark last night as they edged past Armenia in their opening Euro 2016 qualifying group game.

The 22-year-old, who impressed in his maiden season for Spurs, was uncharacteristically lacklustre throughout as he failed to stamp his authority on the game, although he was just relieved the Danes got the three points.

When speaking to Bold he said: 'I lacked a little sharpness for sure.

'I found the right places, but I did not really exploit the opportunities that were there. I just lacked the final sharpness', Eriksen added. 

After being thumped at home by the same opponents during qualification for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, it was a particularly rewarding win for Eriksen and co as they got their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign off to the best possible start.

He added: 'Everyone wanted a clean slate after what happened last time and I think we did that.'
