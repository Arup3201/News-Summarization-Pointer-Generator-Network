Southampton left-back Luke Shaw will complete a £34million transfer to Manchester United in the next 24 hours after arriving at the club's AON Training Complex on Thursday evening.

The England international met United officials and got a personal tour at Carrington HQ ahead of a medical on Friday morning, and the deal was all but completed while the 18-year-old made his World Cup debut in Brazil.

Shaw will stay overnight in a Manchester hotel before visiting Old Trafford to be shown around and have promotional photographs taken on Friday.

Move: Southampton left-back Shaw is set to become the most expensive teenager in history

The defender, set to become the most expensive teenager in history, will head away on holiday before meeting his new team-mates for pre-season.

Shaw has scheduled his time away to return for United's tour of America.

The youngster is understood to have informed 
Southampton of his desire to leave the club at the end of May and a wage
 package in excess of £100,000-per-week has been agreed in principle between 
United and the player for some time.

Former
 Old Trafford boss David Moyes laid the groundwork in persuading 
Shaw to make the move, as United overcame interest from Chelsea to 
secure their man with a superior salary.

It is understood Louis van Gaal has given his blessing for 
the deal to go ahead.

United
 cooled their interest in recent weeks to ensure Shaw was focused on the World Cup but, as Sportsmail revealed 
on Monday morning, executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward intended to 
accelerate the pursuit once England returned from Brazil on Wednesday 
afternoon.

Shaw 
disembarked at Luton airport to see his family before heading up to the 
North-West to become Van Gaal's second Manchester United signing, 
after Ander Herrera completing his £29m transfer to the club on Thursday 
afternoon.

The fee for 
Shaw is somewhat higher than United initially hoped for, with 
Southampton's resistance, Shaw's involvement in the 
World Cup and the arrival of Dutch manager Ronald Koeman, who has sanctioned the sale.

 fee from Chelsea.

Shaw, a product of Southampton's 
highly-acclaimed academy, will compete with Patrice Evra for the 
left-back spot after the France international penned a one-year deal to 
stay at Old Trafford.

Speaking after England's 0-0 draw with Costa Rica at the World Cup, Shaw was asked whether he needed Champions League football upon his Premier League return.

Shaw said: 'Obviously Champions 
League would help, playing against world-class players, but you can't 
just say that because you look at other teams that have gone through the
 groups and they haven't got all Champions League players.

'I don't know. I think we'll have a look at it and just to try and move on in the coming few months.'

The proposed move comes after United legend Paul Scholes warned £34million for Shaw would be too much.

Scholes thinks that kind of money could be better spent on a striker who would guarantee van Gaal at least 30 goals a season.

'The proposed £34m transfer for the 18-year-old Luke Shaw to Manchester United is another example of something which has a bad long-term impact,' he said.

'Clubs are priced out of this market which is why they go abroad for cheap options - they’re not better players.

'For a left-back to be worth £34m shows how silly the game has gone. For that money I want a centre-forward who’s going to score 30 goals a season.'

Shaw, who turns 19 in July, already has 60 appearances in the Premier League and three England caps to his name.

It comes with Alexander Buttner set to leave United for Dinamo Moscow, while Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic already left after a lack-luster season.

Leap: Shaw can have a medical at Old Trafford, but Paul Scholes thinks the price tag is too much

History: Wayne Rooney at £27m was the most expensive teenager but Shaw could best the United striker
