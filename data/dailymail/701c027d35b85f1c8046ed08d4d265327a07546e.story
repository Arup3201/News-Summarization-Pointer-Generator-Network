Nobody that day at the High Court will forget it. The screams of abuse and sobbing relatives in the public gallery as the jury returned its verdict, and actress Gillian Taylforth collapsing in a Victorian swoon of despair and being wheeled to an ambulance.

It was January 25, 1994, and Taylforth, who at that time was playing cafe owner Kathy Beale in the BBC1 soap opera EastEnders, had sued The Sun for libel, and lost.

Fundamentally, it was a simple issue. She challenged the red-top tabloid after it published a report that a policeman saw her performing a sex act on her fiance in their car while parked in a  lay-by. Her story was that he was not well and she was simply soothing his tummy.

Gillian Taylforth and her then boyfriend Geoff Knights, who sued the Sun for libel

Even in the richly endowed annals of High Court libel actions over the years, this one produced evidence that was uniquely colourful and stark, including film taken at a party some years earlier of the actress simulating sex acts, using a bottle and a sausage.

Added to this was the diminutive, intriguingly soft-voiced figure of the late George Carman QC, representing The Sun, a man about whom it was said in legal circles ‘doesn’t clear his throat for less than £10,000’.

So it is hardly surprising that a reconstruction of this hotly contested libel action has been chosen to be the first in a series of court reconstructions, The Trial, starting tonight on Channel 5. As the jury heard, it all began 18 months earlier, in June 1992, when Taylforth and her fiance, Geoff Knights, went to Royal Ascot, where he drank champagne.

As she drove them home in her Range Rover, they stopped in a lay-by on the A1, near Trotters Bottom in Hertfordshire.

As luck would have it, a police patrol car came by at that moment, and PC  Terence Talbot stopped to check the parked vehicle. Peering through the Range Rover window, he saw Taylforth with her head on Knights’s lap.

He was in no doubt she was performing a sex act, ‘lying prone’ across the front seat ‘with her head moving slightly up and down in Mr Knights’s lap’.

Knights was taken to the police station — Taylforth went to collect their daughter — where he accepted a caution for gross indecency. According to another policeman, Knights said they’d had ‘a good day at the races, the urge got hold of us on the way home — you know how it is’.

That might have been the end of the matter — except a story about the arrest later appeared on the front page of The Sun under the banner headline ‘TV Kathy’s Sex Romp Fury’. A furious Taylforth and Knights denied there had been a sex act, but the tabloid refused to back down. So the couple sued for libel.

When the verdict was announced the actress collapsed and had to be taken away by ambulance

This was the state of play as the warring parties assembled in Court 13 at the High Court on January, 11, 1994, with a jury of eight men and four women.

Taylforth’s barrister was rangey Old Etonian Michael Beloff QC. He told the court that the officer’s reaction to the A1 lay-by incident was ‘a simple misunderstanding’.

What he had, in fact, seen — Knights with trousers undone and Taylforth leaning across him — was simply Taylforth trying to comfort Knights after he had suffered an attack of  pancreatitis. She was massaging his stomach because he felt sick after drinking too much champagne.

In the witness box, the actress wept and said she felt ‘disgusted’ and ‘ashamed’ of the sex act allegation. She shouted at Carman, The Sun’s barrister, when he accused her of making up her story about Knights being unwell ‘to cover your tracks’.

‘I would never have been able to make up any such lies like that,’ she snapped. ‘How could anyone think that you could stop on the A1 for oral sex with cars going by?’ Asked by her own counsel to describe how The Sun’s story made her feel, she replied: ‘It is so cheap, it makes me feel sick to the stomach.’

For his part, wheeler-dealer Geoff Knights was much more relaxed in the witness box, agreeing he undid his trousers in the lay-by when his girlfriend was comforting him.

There was an amusing moment when Carman asked him to list his criminal convictions and prison sentences. ‘What, all of them?’ was his reply. After which he read aloud a lengthy list including assault and breaking a man’s jaw.

At the time, Miss Taylforth played Kathy Beale in the soap Eastenders and has also starred in Hollyoaks and Footballers' Wives

So the battle raged — outside the courtroom as well as in. For, to allow the jury to see how the alleged sex act took place, everyone trooped out into the West Green car park of the Gothic courtroom complex in The Strand. Led by Mr Justice Drake, jurors, barristers and members of the Press all formed a circle round a metallic blue Range Rover — the very car at the heart of the case.

Already sitting inside were  Taylforth, then 36, and Knights, 38. This time, they were about to perform what they claimed really happened in the car — but this time in front of a circle of some 30 people.

Knights sat bolt upright in the front passenger seat. Taylforth, wearing a tight black suit with white stitching, leaned towards him and gently patted his stomach. On this occasion, Knights did not undo his trousers. As she went through her patting procedure, Taylforth’s face was, according to witnesses ‘a picture of concern’.

Moments later, two lookalike stand-ins — Sarah Stephens and Sean Rayment, both journalists on The Sun — were directed into position in the car by PC Talbot to re-enact what he insisted he saw. This time, the woman’s face could not be seen as she buried it in her companion’s lap while the solemn circle of observers took turns to peer in.

As the young pair emerged, pink-faced, Carman declared the second enactment could not be ‘exact’ because the stand-in’s penis had not been exposed.

The brilliant QC hadn’t finished.

On the opening day of the second week of the action, he calmly tossed into the case an unexpected bombshell that had been delivered to his legal team over the weekend. This was a 35-minute home-video that had been obtained — for a fee — by News International, the publisher of The Sun.

It had been filmed six years earlier, in 1988, at the 20th anniversary daytime party of the Anna Scher Theatre School in Islington, north London, and among the guests were the stars of popular TV shows including Grange Hill, The Bill, Casualty, London’s Burning and EastEnders.

Carman believed the video contained important character evidence the jury should see. Beloff, for  Taylforth, argued it should be inadmissible as court evidence.

With the jury told by the judge to be absent, they each argued their case. Eventually, the judge ruled in favour of Carman. At first, as the film was played, the actress occasionally  giggled and pointed out people on the screen to Knights.

In one 
clip, the jury saw Taylforth standing in a street, opposite a 
playground, apparently simulating masturbation with a wine bottle 
between her legs, and saying: ‘I could sell my services down the road.’

Another
 showed her surrounded by friends and holding a large German sausage, 
intermittently in her mouth. She was smiling at the  camera and saying: 
‘I’d like to state I give good head (a slang term for oral sex). I give 
very good head.’

She
 then asked if anyone ‘has a battery for it’. After the jury had watched
 the film, Taylforth went back into the witness box, where she explained
 she was pretending the sausage was a vibrator.

More recently Miss Taylforth appeared in Strictly Come Dancing and partnered Anton du Beke

‘It was only a joke with a sausage — nothing more than that,’ she said, ‘just a joke between friends.’

Replying to her counsel, she said her sister, a police constable, was also at the party. How had she felt, Beloff asked, when Carman accused her of lying to the jury? ‘What can I say? I just think it’s totally unfair,’ she said.

In the closing speeches, Carman accused Taylforth of ‘acting’ to the jury, while he himself was accused of trying to influence the jury with ‘magician’s tricks’.

Then, after almost two weeks, the jury went out. Almost five-and-a-half hours later, the jury foreman rose to announce the verdict, and Taylforth’s left hand could be seen tightly gripping Knights’s wrist.

‘Oh God,’ she gasped, and then she began to sob amid shouts and abuse from friends and family in the public gallery towards the police and even at the judge.

As Carman asked for the couple to pay The Sun’s legal costs (a crippling £500,000), the actress’s mouth opened and she finally collapsed, was carried out to an ambulance, and taken to hospital, where she swiftly recovered. The jury’s decision, it must be said, was not unanimous. They found for The Sun 10-2.

Carman had suggested Taylforth — the Cockney daughter of a printer and a cleaning lady — sued to prevent the story damaging her career. In fact, although she lost, it seems to have had no impact at all.

In the 20 years since, Taylforth has scarcely been out of work. She has appeared in Footballers’ Wives and The Bill, partnered Anton Du Beke in Strictly Come Dancing in 2008 and was in Celebrity Big Brother last year. For several years she has starred in Hollyoaks, which she is leaving this summer for ‘family reasons’.

She and Knights were together for 23 often stormy years and had two children. They parted in 2009 and he died last year aged 58 from cancer.
