'@natsecwonk': Under an anonymous Twitter account Jofi Joseph bashed his bosses and other Washington elites

A White House national security adviser is out of the job after it was revealed he was behind a Twitter page popular amongst Washington D.C.'s foreign policy community that he often used to anonymously insult many of his bosses and other powerful D.C. insiders.

Additionally, Jofi Joseph, a director in the non-proliferation section of the National Security Staff at the White House, used the account - with the moniker @natsecwonk - to reveal internal information about the Obama White House for more than two years.

At times, Joseph even used the page to take shots at Jews.

'Is it just me, or with the Jews celebrating Rosh Hashanah tonight, is Twitter much quieter?' he posted on September 4.

Joseph started posting on the account 
in February 2011 and used it to insult powerful politicians until it was
 deleted last week, presumably after he'd been shown the door at the 
White House.

Two administration officials confirmed to the Daily Beast that Joseph was the man behind the account.

'I'm a fan of Obama, but his continuing reliance and dependence upon a 
vacuous cipher like Valerie Jarrett concerns me,” he once tweeted, referring to one of the president's senior advisers.

'Vacuous cipher': Joseph had some choice words about senior Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett

'Beer goggles': Joseph tweeted that Huma Abedin must have been wearing beer goggles when she married Anthony Wiener

Other targets Joseph's Twitter rants include former National Security Advisor Tom Donilon, Deputy National Security 
Advisor Ben Rhodes, Secretary of State John Kerry, and many others.

'Was Huma Abedin wearing beer goggles the night she met Anthony Wiener? 
Almost as bad a pairing as Samantha Powers and Cass Sunstein ....,” he 
tweeted in 2011, prior to the sexting scandal that ended Wiener's career in Congress.

In another tweet, he took a swipe at former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and her family.

'So when will someone do us the favor of getting rid of Sarah Palin and 
the rest of her white trash family? What utter useless garbage .... ,' 
he tweeted last October.

'White trash': Joseph not only went after Sarah Palin, but took shots at her family, too

Joseph is married to Carolyn Leddy, is a well-respected professional staffer on the Republican side of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Politico reporter Glenn Thrush said Tuesday that he spoke with Josephand asked if behind the Twitter account. Joseph would neither confirm nor deny whether he was.

According to Thrush, Joseph said his that asking him about the Twitter account was 'ridiculous' and 'would affect his ability to get a new job.'

Prior to his job in the Obama administration, Joseph was an adviser to Under Secretary of State Ellen Tauscher on a range of 
multilateral arms control treaties; and before serving in the White 
House he advised and worked with U.S. Senator Robert Casey Jr. and 
Senator Joseph Biden Jr.
