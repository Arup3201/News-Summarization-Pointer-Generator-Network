Culprit? Artist Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper, a crime writer is suggesting

Crime writer Patricia Cornwell is promising to publish new research on the identity of Jack the Ripper which she claims will help to solve the mystery.

The best-selling author believes she has 'cracked' the case by unearthing evidence that confirms Walter Sickert, an influential artist, as the prime suspect.

Fans of the painter were critical of her first book for pointing the finger at the painter, but she has spent the last 11 years working to prove her theory.

She says she has a lot more detail and predicts people will be surprised by evidence she has unearthed linking Sickert with the royal family.

'I feel that I have cracked it,' she said.

'I believe it’s Sickert, and I believe it now more than ever.'

Furthermore, Ms Cornwell, 47, says the 
artist had links to the royal family - perhaps backing some kind of royal 
conspiracy in relation to the crimes.

The bestselling author has been working with former Scotland Yard commander John Grieve to look through a selection of letters, held at The National Archives in Kew, allegedly sent to police by the killer.

While she admits her evidence is only circumstantial, Ms Cornwell argues it hard to accept it is merely a coincidence watermarks on some of the letters match paper used by Sickert.

'Will we ever prove it? No — how can you?

'It’s a completely circumstantial case with the only real science that we can count on after all these years being the forensic analysis, which is really hard to feel is coincidental when you keep seeing water marks on paper that Jack the Ripper and Sickert had in common.'

The author acknowledged that even if the artist wrote some of the letters, it does not mean Sickert was the killer.

However, she added: 'In court, a jury might struggle with that. They are very confessional and violent letters.'

The writer has spent millions of pounds investigating the unidentified killer - who killed at least five prostitutes in Whitechapel in the late 1880s.

The dedicated investigator even purchased Sickert’s desk, plus 32 of his paintings to have them tested for DNA.

According to The Evening Standard,she plans on printing her new findings next year.

She added: 'I have a lot more detail including more information on what I call the ‘royal conspiracy’.

'For a start — Sir William Gull was Queen Victoria’s surgeon. There have been rumours that Sir William Gull was helping to get rid of these prostitutes. Suffice to say there has been evidence that has turned up to say that Sir William was Sickert’s family physician.'

Ms Cornwell's 2002 book on the topic, Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper—Case Closed,  first included her theory that Sickert was the Ripper.

The controversial book caused outrage in the art world and also among 'Ripperologists' -  who did not agree with her methods or conclusions.

Ms Cornwell recently won a court battle against company she had hired to handle her finances - with a court awarding her £30 million.

Patricia Cornwell’s new novel Dust is out now.

Notorious: A poster for the capture of the serial killer

Numerous individuals have been accused of being the serial killer.

At the time, police suspected the Ripper must have been a butcher, due to the way his victims were killed  and the fact they were discovered near to the dockyards, where meat was brought into the city.

There are several alleged links between the killer and royals. First is Sir William Withey Gull, the royal physician. Many have accused him of helping get rid of the prostitutes' bodies, while others claim he was the Ripper himself.

Another book named Queen Victoria's surgeon Sir John Williams as the infamous killer. He had a surgery in Whitechapel at the time.

Another theory links the murders with Queen Victoria's grandson, Prince Albert Victor, also known as the Duke of Clarence.

At one point, cotton merchant James Maybrick was the number one suspect, following the publication of some of his diary which appeared to suggest he was the killer. However the extracts are widely believed to be forged.

Other suspects include Montague John Druitt, a Dorset-born barrister. He committed suicide in the Thames shortly after last murder.

George Chapman, otherwise known as Seweryn Kłosowski, poisoned three of his wives and was hanged in 1903.

Another suspected by polive was Aaron Kosminski. He was admitted to Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum and died there.

Dr Thomas Neill Cream, poisoned four London prostitutes with strychnine and was hanged.

Some of the more bizarre links include Lewis Carroll, author of the Alice in Wonderland books, who taught at Christ Church until 1881 - which was at the forefront of the Ripper Murder scenery.

According to some sources Jack was actually a Jill - a theory posed by an inspector on the case at the time.

Winston Churchill's father - Lord Randolph Churchill - has also been named as a potential suspect.
