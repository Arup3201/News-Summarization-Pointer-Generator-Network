UKIP was hit by a fresh race row yesterday after a senior aide to Nigel Farage referred to a British Asian journalist as being ‘of some form of ethnic extraction’.

Gawain Towler, the party’s chief press officer, came under fire after he accidentally texted the description to one of the journalist’s colleagues.

Mr Towler, who is also a lead candidate for the party in next year’s European Parliament elections, insisted he had meant no offence and wearily referred to himself as ‘today’s comedy racist’.

But Tory MPs called for him to apologise.

Row: Towler, left, referred to journalist Kiran Randhawa, right, as being 'of some form of ethnic extraction'

Nick de Bois, secretary of the backbench 1992 committee, said: ‘There’s no room in any walk of life, let alone politics, for this type of racially insensitive language.’

Fellow Tory Nadhim Zahawi added: ‘It’s outrageous. Nobody in 2013 should use language like this – especially if you want to be seen as fit to run the country.’

It comes after Godfrey Bloom faced 
criticism for complaining about foreign aid going to ‘Bong Bongo Land’ 
and Mr Farage referred to ‘coloured people’ in a radio interview.

Last week a UKIP councillor insisted he was not racist – because he has been on holiday to the Carribean.

Viv Lewis, 83, repeatedly insisted ‘I 
like coloured people’ as the party again faced claims it was out of 
touch with modern Britain.

Mr Towler is one of Mr Farage’s closest aides and runs the party’s communications operation.

He is standing for the party in next year’s European Parliament elections and is the candidate to become MP for North Dorset.

In a text message exchange he was informing UKIP organisers of a visit to Manchester by Mr Farage.

He warned that there would be two journalists from the London Evening Standard meeting them at Mancehster Piccadilly station.

He wrote: ‘James, my fault but I told the Standard that Nigel would be arriving at approx. 10.30 this morning.

Publicity: The row risked distracting from UKIP leader Nigel Farage's visit to Manchester where he hopes to woo disaffected Tories

‘They have called and I expect a snapper and a female journalist (of some form of ethnic extraction) at Piccadilly.’

The remark about Kiran Randhawa, a British Asian journalist who works for the Standard, sparked a furious backlash.

Mr Towler rejected the claim he was racist, telling reporters his wife is Indian. But he added: ‘I am today’s comedy racist.’

He blamed a poor quality answerphone message in which he had not picked up the ‘multi-syllabled’ name of the journalist.

He later told The Times: ‘If I’d got the right name I would have used it but I didn’t so I needed to give a head up

‘I was thinking of using the term “babe” but they aren’t going to have the first idea what I’m going on about.’

But Tories at their party conference in Manchester condemned the remarks.

Nick de Bois told the Standard: ‘There’s no room in any walk of life, let alone politics, for this type of racially insensitive language.’

Apology: UKIP councillor Viv Lewis, from Cornwall, repeatedly referred to 'coloured people' during a TV interview but denied being racist

Nadhim Zahawi added: ‘It’s outrageous. Nobody in 2013 should use language like this — especially if you want to be seen as fit to run the country.’

The row distracted attention from Mr Farage’s appearnces in Manchester where he tried to woo Conservative to back his party in next year’s European elections.

Mr Farage insisted Mr Towler’s remark was ‘not meant maliciously’ and only people who were ‘very silly’ could consider it to be racist.

Asked whether Mr Towler should be sacked for the comment, he added: ‘What would you suggest, prison camp? Forced labour?’

Mr Farage has tried to repair the party’s 
reputation in recent weeks, insisting it had ‘grown up’ and was ready to
win seats in the Commons.

Last week Mr Lewis, from Cornwall, was been forced to apologise for a BBC TV 
interview where he denied being a racist - while also referring to 
‘coloured people’.

Asked 
about UKIP’s immigration policy, he said: ‘I have already had heated 
arguments about that. Racist I am not. I like coloured people.

‘I have been to the West Indies. I have sampled their hospitality. I like coloured people.

‘But
what I don’t like is people who walk into this country and immediately 
get given money when there’s a lot more deserving cases among English, 
British people,’ said the retired coach driver who represents Cornwall’s
Camborne Treswithian.
