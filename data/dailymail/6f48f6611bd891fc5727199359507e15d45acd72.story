The nightingale is in dangerous decline and could disappear from Britain if breeding sites are not protected from developers, experts have warned.

A 2012 survey by the British Trust for Ornithology showed there are just 3300 pairs of nightingales left in the whole country.

Data from the organisation also suggests the number of the birds in Britain dropped by 57 per 
cent between 1995 and 2009.

Due to this drastic decline in breeding population, the nightingale is now on the amber list of species of 'conservation concern' - a list compiled by a selection of the country's leading bird protection organisations.

Now, nature-lovers are calling for a recording of the creature to be broadcast live on BBC radio.

The idea marks a tradition set almost 90 years ago by the BBC - which on May 18th 1924 broadcast the sound of a nightingale singing in a Surrey wood to almost a million listeners.

The broadcast became a tradition for 20 years until it was halted by the war.

Conservationist Chris Rose, who has launched the petition calling for the broadcast to be reinstated, said: 'The nightingale is just one of many songbirds, which are rapidly vanishing from our countryside, our urban green sanctuaries and suburban woods, and therefore from our lives

'Unfortunately developers and politicians don't care enough to ward off the most obvious threats at bay - at Lodge Hill in Kent, Britain's only woodland specifically designated as a valued breeding site for nightingales is under threat from developers.

'We would like the BBC to restore the tradition and re-connect people all over Britain with the song of the nightingale, live, on May 18th.'

'We believe it's time for the BBC to re-start the tradition, to enrich our quality of life and give its millions of listeners the chance to hear a real, live nightingale singing, if only once a year.

'Fewer and fewer people now get to hear 
the song these days and the reasons are complex - researchers blame a 
combination of climate change, farm development in its African wintering
 grounds, the destruction of nesting habitat by muntjac deer in this 
country, poor woodland management and pesticides, for its decline.

'Anyone who has ever heard the song of a nightingale, knows the extraordinary heart-lifting, soul-penetrating power of the voice of this bird.'

Paul Stancliffe, of the British Trust for Ornithology said: 'The song of the nightingale is arguably the most beautiful of any British bird but it is a song that is getting harder to hear with each passing year.

'Its stronghold has always been the south-east but even here it is declining and since 1995 we have lost almost half of our breeding nightingales.

'Add to this the very short song period, nightingales can only be reliably heard during the last days of April to the first few days of June, and we can all appreciate that hearing one is very special indeed.'

Slightly larger than a robin, nightingales were first noted in Anglo Saxon times though fossilised remains date them back to as long as 100,000 years ago.

The creature inspired John Keats to write one of his most famous poems - Ode to a Nightingale.
