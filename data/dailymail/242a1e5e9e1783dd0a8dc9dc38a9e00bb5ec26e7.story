It's the baby shower trend which swept America, leaving expectant parents weeping with joy at the sight of blue or pink sponge.

And now gender reveal parties, where mothers-to-be discover the sex of their unborn baby in front of guests by cutting into a cake, have arrived in Britain.

Reality television stars are among the first to join in, sharing photographs of their fluorescent baked goods on social media to the delight of fans.

The popular trend has arrived in the UK, with expectant parents learning the sex of their baby by cutting into a dyed cake. TOWIE star Dan Osborne and his pregnant actress girlfriend Jacqueline Jossa shared their news with fans on social media last month (above)

Forums on Mumsnet have been dedicated to the subject, with users agonising over whether to opt for cupcakes, cake-pops or multi-tier masterpieces for the big day.

While naysayers have dismissed the parties as overindulgent and extravagant, event planners have begun cashing in on impatient parents' need to know and tell.

Party Pieces, the website owned by Carole Middleton, is selling gender reveal balloons at £1.99 a packet. The balloons are filled with pink or blue confetti, with guests discovering the baby's sex after popping them. 

Customers can also purchase plates, cups and napkins to go along with the theme.

Despite her family's interest in the business, there are no reports to suggest the Duchess of Cambridge, who is six months pregnant, will be taking part in such a party.

One couple who are taking part in the act said it allowed relatives to join in with a woman's pregnancy and allow the mother to prepare.

'I wasn't going to find out the sex of the baby until the birth, but then I read about these parties and thought ti would be a really lovely way to share the news with our families and friends,' Katy Edwards from Portsmouth told the Times.

At her 20 week scan, Mrs Edward's sonographer wrote down the sex of her baby for it to be passed along to her baker friend.

'I am from a big family and we share a lot, so we thought it would be nicer to all find out together rather than just the two of us at the birth.'

But critics in favour of a more traditional approach said the party takes away from the 'magic' of finding out a baby's sex at birth. 

'It's so lovely to say "Come and greet your baby," and the parents discover it is a daughter or son. It's magical,' said Louise Silverton, the director of midwifery at the Royal College of Midwives. 

The trend started in America, with expectant mothers describing the parties as a way to share their excitement with loved ones
