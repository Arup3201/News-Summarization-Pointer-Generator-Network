Isaac Nash, aged 12, from Highburton in West Yorkshire, who drowned after being swept out to sea during a family holiday off the coast of Anglesey

The grandfather of a boy of 12 who drowned after being swept out to sea on a family holiday broke down in tears yesterday as he described his desperate attempts to rescue his grandson.

Paul Nash, 62, recalled the moment he lost his grip on Isaac Nash as they were forced on to jagged rocks by strong waves.

The sporty schoolboy had been swimming with his brother Xander, ten, when they were dragged into a strong current near a river estuary off Anglesey in North Wales. Their father, Adam Nash, helped Xander to shore, but Isaac was swept away and his body was never found.

Mr Nash Sr, a businessman, told an inquest: ‘I swam after the boys and when I got to them they were screaming and shouting.

‘I screamed at them “swim”. Isaac was seriously panicking, he was disappearing under the waves and shouting that he couldn’t breathe.

‘I got hold of him, two or three times, but a big wave bashed us against the rocks. I hurt my head.

‘I turned to try and find Isaac, I was fighting against the waves and I lost him at that point. I was being knocked on to the rocks and back into the water and was screaming “Isaac, Isaac”, but I couldn’t see him and got no response. I hauled myself out on to the rocks but I couldn’t see any sign of him.

‘The next thing I knew I was stuck out on a rock, clinging on with waves hitting me, that’s when help came.’

Isaac died last August 29 during a family camping trip, the inquest in Llangefni, Anglesey, heard. The day before, he had run up the 3,560ft Mount Snowdon with his father and brother. The Nashes were due to return home to High Burton, in West Yorkshire, that afternoon.

As they walked along Aberffraw Beach, Mr Nash Jr, 35, a creative designer, shouted to his sons to stay in shallow water away from the estuary of the River Ffraw.

But the court heard they were quickly swept out of their depth. Strong winds and a high spring tide created a fast current along rocks next to a deep underwater trench.

Through tears, Mr Nash Jr said he took the decision to go after his younger son, who was being carried out to sea away from his brother.

‘I heard my son Isaac calling out, it was more of a shriek,’ he said. ‘They were being swept around the side by the rocks. I ran in, I didn’t have time to take my trousers off.

‘As I got towards Xander he was struggling to breathe, the waves were coming over his face. The waves were so frequent I couldn’t keep hold of him for long.’

Eventually, Mr Nash Jr helped Xander back to the beach where his wife Zoe and daughter Greta, two, were waiting. Xander was blue with cold and told his mother: ‘I didn’t think I would make it.’

Despite searches by lifeboats, an RAF helicopter and underwater teams, Isaac’s body was not found.

Mr Nash today described his grandson as a 'mischievous and fun-loving' boy who 'pushed the limits'

Mr Nash Sr, who had visited the beauty spot for 55 years, said he knew the estuary was dangerous and had warned the boys. But they were having fun in the waves and drifted too close. By the time the family realised they were in danger, it was too late. Mr Nash Sr added: ‘When I was a child, a boy from the village who was a strong swimmer died in the same place. I am fully aware it can be very dangerous.’

Coroner Dewi Pritchard-Jones recorded a verdict of misadventure and said he would be writing to Anglesey Council to recommend permanent signs warning people not to swim near the estuary.

Mrs Nash, 35, a teacher, said Isaac was a good swimmer who was ‘one step off competition swimming’. She said: ‘I thank God for giving me an amazing, special boy for 12 years, who packed his life to the full.’

Mr Nash Sr said the family had established a trust to raise £100,000 for a new skate park and £10,000 for the RNLI in his memory. ‘There were no limits with Isaac,’ he said. ‘He pushed himself in everything, he was clever, very quick-minded.’
