One of the last cobbled streets in Lancashire is being covered with Tarmac, after a 30-year battle by residents.

The rectangular smooth 'setts' on Wellfield Road, Blackburn, have lasted 130 years but are now in very poor repair.

They are now being ripped up after decades of complaints from residents, who say they are 'delighted'.

Residents have been trying to get the cobbles replace for the past 30 years

Blackburn with Darwen Council has agreed that the stone paving will be dug up and replaced with a modern Tarmac surface at a cost of £75,000, initially paid for by the borough.

Because the road is currently a private highway, the 42 residents will pay back between £2,000 to £5,000 each over 10 years, after which the council will 'adopt it' and pay for its maintenance and repair.

Borough regeneration boss Maureen Bateson and Blackburn Local History Society chairman Ray Smith believe there are now just a handful of roads still laid with Victorian stone setts.

The rest have been replaced or covered over with Tarmac to accommodate the vehicles that have replaced the horse and carriage in the last century 

Corporation Park Councillor Arshid Mahmood said: 'This is long overdue. The road is in a dreadful state.

Though generally referred to as cobbles, the term is technically reserved for the medieval round small stones used to make highways, especially hilly streets - which were easier for horses to use.

In the 19th century, cobbles four inches in diameter were used to make it easier for horses to get toe-holds.

Cobblestones are nothing new, however: the Romans used paving stones as early as the 3rd century BC. 

Granite was used because it could be broken apart relatively easily, and wouldn't wear completely smooth.

Tarmac came to prominence at the beginning of the 20th century, and cobblestones are now a rarity in residential neighbourhoods.

'Residents have been asking for this for 30 years but the problem was who paid.

'Two years ago, we asked residents to sign a petition and 90 per cent asked the council to act. It set aside £75,000 and then we had to get all the residents to agree to pay.

'After discussion, they agreed to pay between £2,000 and £5,000, to be reclaimed over 10 years.

'It will save them on car repair bills and add as much as £10,000 to house values.'

Wellfield Road resident Ayyub Patel said: 'We are delighted. It's well worth.'
