Real Sociedad manager Moyes is looking to tap into the loan market during the January transfer window

Real Sociedad, who are currently 14th in La Liga, do not have a league fixture until January 4 when they host Barcelona at Anoeta Stadium.

Moyes saw Liverpool claim all three points thanks to second-half winner by Raheem Sterling.

Sir Alex Ferguson's Old Trafford successor has been linked with a loan move for Manchester United's Adnan Januzaj since taking over the reins at Sociedad. 

Moyes recently admitted that he was hoping to tap into the loan market during the upcoming transfer window.

He said: 'The president has been very good with me and he is going to let me see what I can do. 

'My intention is maybe going into the loan market to bring in a couple of players on loan. If I can boost the squad and give everybody a lift then I will try to do that.' 

Raheem Sterling scored the only goal of the game to ensure Liverpool claimed all three points against Burnley
