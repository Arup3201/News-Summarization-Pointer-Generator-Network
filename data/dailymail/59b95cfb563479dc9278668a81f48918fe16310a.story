It boasts an 18-hole golf course, award-winning restaurant, a swimming pool and state-of-the-art spa and fitness studio.

So luxurious is the Worsley Park Marriott Hotel, it was once  chosen as a base by the England football team.

But luxury comes at a price – around £150 a night in this case – raising questions as to why health bosses and GPs gathered there, at the taxpayer’s expense, to work out how to find £18million of budget cuts.

The 28 delegates stayed at the four-star hotel, which is set in 200 acres of beautiful parkland around eight miles from Manchester city centre, for one night last month, racking up a bill of £4,060 for the short stay.

Last night patients and campaigners condemned the decision by the Bolton Clinical Commissioning Group to splash out on the ‘junket’. Josh Lennon, who was recently an outpatient at the Royal Bolton Hospital, said: ‘You have to ask yourself where is their common sense?

‘Did they really not sit down and think about how this junket might be perceived by the public and people that use their services?

‘It is absolutely preposterous and if their judgement is so flawed on basic decisions like this then should they really be in charge of £18million health funds?’

The Bolton Clinical Commissioning Group met with the aim of drawing up a ‘strategic development plan’ for the next financial year.

Delegates stayed overnight and tucked into two buffet lunches and dinner, with the bill coming in at £145 a head.

The hotel offers massages but none were paid for by taxpayers' money. A member of the public asked: 'Is this good use of public money, when most of them live within easy travelling distance and NHS staff are being made redundant?'

Su Long, designate chief officer of 
Bolton’s CCG, said she looked at the alternatives, but the Marriott was 
‘the best value offer’.

But she added the CCG, which is a new body set up to replace the Primary
Care Trust, would be reviewing the choice to make sure it was the best 
use of resources.

An outgoing chief constable was treated to a lavish leaving party costing the taxpayer more than £4,000 it has been revealed.

A Freedom of Information request revealed that Avon and Somerset Police spent £4,090 on a leaving party for Colin Port at the plush Bristol Zoo Pavilion last month.

The bash, at the end of January was attended by fellow chief constables, former Police Authority members, community leaders, local dignitaries and members of the press and the BBC.

Guests were treated to wine and a gourmet finger buffet including an array of luxury sandwiches, chicken satay, fish goujons, sausages and bruschetta.

The evening was arranged to say thank you to Mr Port who took the helm of Avon and Somerset police in 2005.

Under his leadership recorded crime in Bristol fell by a third and detection rates shot up the national league tables.

But when Sue Mountstevens was elected Police and Crime Commissioner and Mr Port found out he would have to apply again for his job he decided to step down.

Miss Long said: ‘We take very seriously someone who is concerned we would waste taxpayers’ money, we really consider what we spend our money on.

‘I have felt on reflection it has been a really good use of time and resources, but obviously we always need to look at it and reflect whether it has been a good use of money and whether we should do it again.’

Miss Long said it would have taken the staff ‘two months of normal meetings to get through the amount of work’ they completed at the hotel, because it allowed them to work ‘rapidly and intensively’.

Members of the CCG’s board and leadership team and 17 GPs, who are clinical leads, gathered at the hotel at 1pm on Thursday, January 31, and left at 1.30pm the next day.

They worked until their evening meal, which was included in the package, socialised during the evening, stayed over and continued to work the next day.

Drinks and other refreshments were paid for by individuals, though some chose not to stay overnight.

She added: ‘We are a new team and organisation and it is the sort of day that we think is useful for planning the start of the year.’

The CCG discussed how to make efficiencies of £18million, with £12million saving to be made now and an additional £6million for future years.

She said government cuts to CCGs meant they needed to find savings so they could continue to provide new services.

Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘It beggars belief that NHS executives think it’s appropriate to plan an away day at an expensive four-star hotel, particularly when much of their discussion should be focusing on saving money and trimming fat from budgets.

‘It demonstrates that the public sector top brass is completely out of touch with the hard-working families who have to foot the bill for luxurious overnight stays like this. NHS bosses owe it to taxpayers and patients to hold these meetings for as little cost as possible.’
