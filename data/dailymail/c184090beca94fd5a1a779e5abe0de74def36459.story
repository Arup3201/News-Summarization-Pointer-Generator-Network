People who meet their sexual partners through dating apps are more likely to catch an STI, new research suggests.

The study found the risk is higher for those who meet people through apps than for those who meet sexual partners online or in bars and clubs.

In the last few years, smartphone apps - such as Tinder and Grindr - have become increasingly popular ways to meet potential sexual partners.

They allow registered users to use their smartphones’ GPS to locate and network with other users in the vicinity.

Grindr, which was one of the first such apps, accumulated 2.5 million new users in 2012, and in 2013 reported that it had six million users in 192 countries.

But, the research, which was published in the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections, revealed they are not without their downsides.

Researchers collected data on 7,000 gay men attending a sexual health clinic in Los Angeles between 2011 and 2013.

All of the participants provided information about their drug use and how they find sexual partners.

A third revealed they meet sexual partners in person only, 30 per cent said they use a combination of person-to-person and online dating and 36 per cent said they use smartphone apps.

The results also showed the apps tend to be favoured by the under-40s and by well-educated men of white or Asian ethnic backgrounds.

One theory is that smartphone 
apps make it easier to meet potential partners more quickly than online 
or more traditional methods, thereby boosting the chances of anonymous 
and riskier encounters.

Men who use them were also found to be more likely to use recreational drugs.

The researchers analysed the results of these men’s sexual health checks and found those who used smartphone apps to hook up were more likely to have common STIs than those who met people in bars or clubs.

They were also more likely to have sexually transmitted infections that were men who met sexual partners online.

Overall, smartphone users were 23 per cent more likely to be infected with gonorrhoea and 35 per cent more likely to be infected with chlamydia.

However, methods of approach made no difference to the likelihood of infection with either HIV or syphilis.

The study authors wrote: ‘Technological advances which improve the efficiency of meeting anonymous sexual partners may have the unintended effect of creating networks of individuals where users may be more likely to have sexually transmissible infections than other, relatively less efficient social networking methods.’

They added: ‘Technology is redefining sex on demand. Prevention programmes must learn how to effectively exploit the same technology, and keep pace with changing contemporary risk factors for [sexually transmitted infections] and HIV transmission.’
