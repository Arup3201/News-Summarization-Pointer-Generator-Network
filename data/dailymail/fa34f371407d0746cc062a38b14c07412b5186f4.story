After claiming that she had no job, was on the verge of losing her home and was down to her last few pounds, it would appear that former Apprentice winner Stella English is now joining the dole queue.

The 34-year-old, who lost a costly legal battle with her former employer Lord Alan Sugar, was spotted walking into a Job Centre in Sittingbourne, Kent, before emerging with forms.

It would appear that the mother-of-two has been forced to claim benefits and attend the job centre in order to receive help from the state, after she she lost her constructive dismissal case against Lord Sugar earlier this year.

Dressed in a bright red dress and high-heeled shoes, the former winner looked glum as she clutched paper forms as she left the building.

Last week said she was trying to claim benefits as she fought off a claim by Lord Sugar, who was trying to win £35,000 in legal costs and damages.

At the original employment tribunal, Lord Sugar claimed Miss English knowingly lied when she said the £100,000-a-year job at his firm, which she won through the BBC programme in 2010, was a sham.

At a hearing it was revealed the businesswoman and mother-of-two is attempting to claim housing benefit and jobseeker's allowance

Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) hands out least £56.80 a week to the unemployed while they look for work - the amount of benefits they receive after that depends on their circumstances; such as National Insurance Payments and their age. 

To claim JSA, Miss English would have to be immediately able to work and actively seeking a new position.

She would also have to attend a JSA interview to discuss her circumstances.

JSA could be stopped as a penalty if they don't go to a Jobcentre Plus office when asked, reject a job or training, fail to apply for any jobs and don't go to any training booked for them.

Recently, she claimed she was making double that amount from new business ventures, including a fashion label and an events company.

But at the hearing this week it emerged that Miss English has not worked since July and is attempting to claim housing benefit and jobseeker’s allowance.

She said that she worked at Citigroup until July, earning £500 a day, but her contract with the banking giant had ended.

She is also facing the prospect of having one of her homes repossessed and has seen her marriage collapse as a result of the stress of the original case.

Miss English told the tribunal that she now only has around £200 in her bank account and was unable to even afford a birthday present for her son.

But it was revealed shortly afterwards that the businesswoman has a property portfolio worth £1million and pays a firm up to £1,000 a week to manage her public relations.

Following that, and a tearful interview on ITV's Daybreak, she was seen at Harrods' luxury tea counter and browsing Stella McCartney bags.

Her spokesman told the Mirror that she only bought tea bags and added: 'They were a present for her mother costing just £3.95.'

Her representative was unavailable to comment when the Mail Online contacted them.
