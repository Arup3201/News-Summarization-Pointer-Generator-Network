A man searching for his wallet inside a dumpster in North Highlands, California was scooped up by a trash truck and trapped for three hours.

He miraculously survived the terrifying ordeal by creating a coffin-like pocket with wooden planks in order to avoid getting crushed. 

Authorities said the man, who has not been named, could have been run over, killed or even squashed by a compacting blade in the incident on January 13.

The man was stuck in the rear of the Atlas garbage truck, as it carried out pick-ups on its way to Yolo County Landfill last week,The Oroville Mercury Register reported.

Yolo County Sheriff's Lt. Martin Torres said the man is lucky to be alive.

Once the garbage truck arrived at the landfill, the driver saw the man crawl out of the trash pile and the driver of the bulldozer was alerted, said Torres.

Luckily the truck was only half full of trash. If it had been filled to capacity a compacted blade would have been used at the bottom of the bin. 

In addition, garbage trucks can use pressure to compact trash, 'so he could have been squashed,' said Torres. 

The man was taken to UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento for complaints of back and neck pain. He suffered minor injuries from his unexpected trip.

Torres said this is the first time he had heard of someone getting stuck in a garbage truck in his 27-year career.

However, there have been other incidences involving the public getting trapped in garbage trucks.

In 2013 an Arizona homeless woman was found in a garbage truck which collected and crushed up to ten loads of trash after she was dumped into it.

Jessica Bunyar, 38, fell asleep in the dumpster when it was picked up by a Copper State Sanitation vehicle in Globe, Arizona.

Bunyar was trapped inside the truck's compactor as it travelled for about one mile collecting rubbish bins. 

The driver only realized he had more than just garbage on board after making ten stops and compacting the load up to ten times. The woman survived the harrowing ordeal.
