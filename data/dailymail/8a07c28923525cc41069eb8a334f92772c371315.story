Daphne and Stanley Green have been married for an incredible 77 years and put it all down to luck.

Mrs Green, 94, said: ‘It is just luck more than anything. There is no big secret about it.

‘We have had our ups and downs, but I wasn’t going to be a “yes” woman all my life.’

My old Dutch: Stanley and Daphne Green married in 1937 and say that their good fortune is all down to luck

She met her future husband in 1935 as she was taking her nephew for a walk in Old Buckenham.

Mr Green, now 97, was out on his bicycle for a ride in the country when he spotted Daphne.

The farm worker asked her out and was delighted when she said yes and regularly cycled the eight miles from his home in North Lopham to see her.

The Happy Day: Daphne and Stanley Green married on March 27, 1937 - the same day that her sister tied the knot and the two couples had a joint reception

I do: Mr Green met his future bride when she was out on a country walk with her nephew. They courted for two years before they married at Old Buckenham Church, Norfolk, on a snowy afternoon on March 27, 1937. They have eight children, 20 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren

Daphne and Stanley Green celebrate 77 years of marriage at their home at Roydon, Norfolk

They married two years later on March 27, 1937 at Old Buckenham Church, Norfolk as the snow fell.

They now have eight children, 20 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren.

Mrs Green’s sister Florence, who has since died, got married the same day and the two couples had a joint reception.

When the Second World War broke out, the Greens took in children evacuated from Putney, south-west London, at their home in North Lopham.

Mr Green did not fight because he was in a reserved occupation alongside his father and grandfather.

Mrs Green who worked in a bakery before retiring has no time for couple who get divorced: ‘There is no give and take these days.

‘I think they make it too easy to walk away, but marriage is hard and you have to work at it.’

The Greens plan to celebrate their anniversary with a family meal.
