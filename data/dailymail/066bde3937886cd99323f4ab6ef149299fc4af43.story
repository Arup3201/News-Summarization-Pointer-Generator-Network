If there's one thing to send a shiver down the spine of a celebrity it's the unveiling of a before-they-were-famous video.

The saying goes that everyone has to start somewhere, yet many A-listers would prefer to forget those few early steps on the way to stardom.

And in this compilation video, we are treated to soap and showering, cheesy grins outside fast-food restaurants, and Morgan Freeman enjoying his Long and Black (cigarette).

Sharp: Brad Pitt is full of the joys in his 1980s ad for Pringles

Brad Pitt, actor and director, had 'the fever' back in the 80s when he advertised Pringles, strutting his stuff shirtless.

It is a far cry from the tough guy he portrayed in Fight Club, that's for certain.

The montage of stars of the screen also includes Bryan Cranston, star of AMC's hit drama Breaking Bad.

In that show, Cranston plays a less-than-clean-living Walter White, who becomes Mr Big in the world of drug production and dealing.

Yet in this clip from around 1987, Cranston is clean as a whistle after advertising Shield soap, which we are told 'leaves you clean and fresh all day long.'

The advert ends with a female telling a cleaned-down Cranston he is a 'changed man' - very different from his latest TV portrayal in Breaking Bad.

Not to be outdone, Cranston's Breaking Bad co-star Aaron Paul's drug in his 1999 commercial is the cereal Pops.

In a haze, Paul tells us that 'all he wants to do is eat', before his screen father caves in and hands over the box to.

Fast food: Michael J Fox's first date went well as he treated his on-screen flame to a McDonalds for dinner

It's always a struggle to get children to eat their greens, yet Elijah Wood showed how it's done when he starred in an 1990 advert for cheddar cheese.

A plate consisting of greens is transformed, perhaps a bit too dramatically, by a deluge of melted cheddar cheese, with Wood finishing by saying 'hooray'.

Keanu Reeves got his crunch back in 1987 when he advertised Kellogg's cornflakes.

The 49-year-old star of the trilogy of films The Matrix sits at a desk tucking into corn flakes, before recoiling back in ecstasy.

In one of the more humorous clips, actor Seth Green tells us all about 'this dream he had' where he changed into the 'guy from the fruit loops box, Toucan Sam in a clip from the early 1990s.

But the jokes on him, as it is actually his co-star on the advert, and also an actor today Giovani Ribisi who is 'the toucan' as he rips off his fake human face to reveal a beak.

Perhaps not surprising, the fast-food industry was keen to use child actors to publicise their offerings.

Suck it up: Morgan Freeman chills back as he enjoys a 'Long & Black' cigarette

Sarah Michelle Gellar is pictured outside a Burger King expressing her love for the fast food chain back in 1981, and we also see Ben Affleck saying that 'you've gotta break the rules' as he too gives in to the BK charm in an ad from 1989. Meg Ryan tells us all about the 'aren't you hungry for a Whopper game' also in publicity for the chain from 1982.

Rivals McDonalds get in on the act with Michael J Fox perched on doorstep with a girl back in 1980, who 'thanks' him for dinner after giving him a peck on the cheek, as 'nobody makes a day like McDonalds can.'

Britney Spears shows off a gleaming smile in her 1993 performaance for Maull's BBQ sauce, but the best is saved until last.

At a time when it was perceived as 'cool' to smoke, legendary actor Morgan Freeman tells us all how 'smooth' the Black & Long cigarettes are from his 1971 advertisement.

The clip is ended with the immortal line uttered by Freeman: 'Stay strong, stay Black & Long.

If that couldn't have tempted you at the time, then nothing would!
