It was fitting and pleasing that Marcello Lippi finished his managerial career as he'd spent much of it - as a champion.

With another winner's medal around his neck, the veteran Italian coach once again found himself being thrown into the air by jubilant players on a field of glory.

It was not as though Lippi, well into his sixties and a World Cup winner, had anything to prove when he decided to move half-way around the world to take charge of Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande in 2012.

But his well-practised philosophy burned on, as did his desire to win things. And that's precisely what he continued to do, adding three Chinese Super League titles, the Chinese FA Cup and the AFC Champions League to his already bulging trophy cabinet.

2013: Wins Chinese Super League and Asian Champions League.

2014: Wins third consecutive Chinese Super League title.  

As another campaign ended in that familiar thrill of success, Lippi, 66, decided that it was time to call it a day.

'I don't want to coach any more, I'm too old,' he said after Sunday's 1-1 draw at Shandong Luneng, a result that won Guanzhou the league for a fourth consecutive season.

'It is my last match as a head coach for the club. Guangzhou Evergrande will have a new coach next season.'

The silverware in China was a beautiful postscript to a stellar career - an extra star to take into posterity. Lippi will continue to serve as their director of football, with the former Italy and Juventus defender Fabio Cannavaro favourite to take his job.

Lippi coached for 32 years, starting out in the Italian lower divisions and climbing the ladder to win five Scudettos and the Champions League with Juventus.

But he topped all that when he led Italy, against all expectations, to World Cup success in Germany in 2006.

In so doing, he became the first coach to have won both the Champions League and the World Cup, a feat later matched by Vicente del Bosque in 2010.

As a player, Lippi was a Libero - a sweeper - in the classic Italian tradition. Between 1969 and 1979, he played 274 league matches for Sampdoria.

Success was modest and Lippi retired from playing at the age of 34 to embark on a coaching career. The year was 1982, the year in which Italy won the World Cup. Perhaps his later success was written in the stars.

The young coach served a thorough apprenticeship with some of Italy's less glamorous clubs, including Pontedera, Siena, Pistiese, Carrarese, Cesena and Lucchese before he rocked up at Napoli in 1993.

This was a club that had worshipped Diego Maradona just a few years earlier but had fallen on hard times. Lippi restored some of their pride, defying a shoestring budget to guide them into the UEFA Cup.

It was an achievement that caught the eye of giants Juventus, with whom he spent five seasons between 1994 and 1999, guiding them to the pinnacle of both the Italian and European games.

He forged a great Bianconeri team - this was the era of Gianluca Vialli, Fabrizio Ravanelli, Didier Deschamps, Ciro Ferrar, Antonio Conte, Zinedine Zidane, Christian Vieri and Alen Boksic.

Lippi led them to the title in 1995, 1997 and 1998. They lost the 1995 UEFA Cup final to a Dino Baggio-inspired Parma but roared back to claim the Champions League 12 months later, beating Ajax on penalties at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.

Juventus were the example for every European team - they were united, hard working, organised and deadly on the counter-attack.

Alex Ferguson's Manchester United, feeling their way back into Europe's top competition as they started to dominate the Premier League, had the misfortune to encounter Lippi's Juventus in consecutive seasons.

Their September 1996 meeting at the Stadio delle Alpi was men against boys as Juventus peppered Peter Schmeichel's goal. It was miraculous United only lost by one, as they also did at Old Trafford later that season.

'Juventus were an example for my Manchester United,' Ferguson later revealed. 'I had my players watch videos of Lippi's team and would say: 'Don't look at the tactics or technique, we had that too; you need to learn to have that desire to win.'

Indeed, Lippi outlined his coaching philosophy in a book called A Game of Ideas: Thoughts and Passions from the Sidelines. He emphasised togetherness and team spirit. A team could be greater than the sum of its parts.

He likened a playing squad to a family, stressing the importance of everyone getting along.

Despite that early success, they fell short in Europe too - losing 3-1 to Borussia Dortmund in the 1997 final in Munich and 1-0 to Real Madrid in Amsterdam a year later.

Even United finally conquered them - in the 1999 semi-finals - but by that time Lippi had departed and Carlo Ancelotti was in the opposition dug-out.

After an unsuccessful season at Inter Milan, Lippi returned to Turin in 2001, winning the Scudetto at the first attempt on a dramatic final day.

He guided them to a fourth Champions League final 12 months later, only for Milan to win on penalties at Old Trafford. The truth is that Lippi could have won more.

He was appointed manager of Italy in 2004, replacing Giovanni Trapattoni. They approached the 2006 World Cup at a low ebb as sordid details emerged of the Calciopoli scandal, in which Lippi was questioned but cleared.

Despite such low expectations, Italy prospered, beating hosts Germany in a classic semi-final in Dortmund and then defeating France on penalties in the Berlin final, forever remembered for Zidane's headbutt on Marco Materazzi.

It was a quite astonishing success and Lippi celebrated in his own inimitable way, by watching a re-run of the whole match alone in his hotel suite while smoking a victory cigar.

With hindsight, Lippi should have ended on a high right there and then. He returned to lead to Azzurri at the 2010 finals in South Africa but the team were a shambles.

They drew with Paraguay and New Zealand before losing to Slovakia, recording their worst World Cup performance since 1966. Lippi resigned after the Slovakia loss.

That led to his final chapter in Guangzhou which is now drawing to a close. The curtain closing on a quite extraordinary career that saw Lippi enjoy sustained success with a coaching philosophy that will endure as a manual for managers the world over.
