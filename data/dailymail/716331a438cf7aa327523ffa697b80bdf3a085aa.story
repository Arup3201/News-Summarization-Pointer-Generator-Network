They're not the first pair of police officers to be called into action while off-duty.

But they’re almost certainly breaking new ground by making an arrest while dressed in zebra and monkey onesies.

PC Tracy Griffin and PC Terri Cave were on their way to a fancy dress party when they encountered a man making threats to kill in a Coventry supermarket in March.

Law of the jungle: Terri Cave and Tracy Griffin were on their way to a fancy dress party in these wildlife onesies when they were suddenly called upon to tackle a man making threats to kill in a supermarket in Coventry

The pair wrestled the man to the ground outside the Co-op store and told staff to dial 999.

The man was arrested and later charged with public order offences.

The two officers, who are based in Solihull, West Midlands, spent the rest of their evening filing reports at the police station rather than heading to the party.

On hearing the news of the arrest, their colleagues at the @SolihullPolice Twitter account tweeted: ‘Man threatening to kill people didn’t expect to be wrestled to the ground by our off-duty officer in a zebra onesie. We go that extra mile.’

PCs Cave and Griffen have now been commended for their actions, described as ‘brave in the extreme’ and ‘in accordance with the highest traditions of British policing’ at a ceremony this week. 

The offender, Brian Eustace, 49, was handed a community order and ordered to carry out 200 hours unpaid work over the incident.

At a ceremony in Edgbaston, Birmingham, they received a Chief Constable’s Commendation in front of family, friends and colleagues – this time dressed in their official uniform.

Brave: PC Cave and PC Griffin as they are more usually dressed when performing their policing duties

Chief Superintendent Alex Murray, from Solihull Police, said: ‘There was a lot of interest in this particular case for obvious reasons but, joking apart, PCs Griffin and Cave were faced with a very dangerous man in difficult circumstances and they stepped up to the plate.

‘Let’s not lose focus on the risk they exposed themselves to, without any protection, in tackling this man.

‘Whether they were in fancy dress or not, the fact is they chose to put a member of the public’s safety above their own and then cancelled their night out to make sure that a professional job was done.’
