A Kansas mother who uses marijuana to treat a debilitating disease is now fighting for custody of her child after the 11-year-old boy disagreed with an anti-drug presentation at his school.

Shona Banda, 37, who published a book about how she uses a liquid form of cannabis as therapy for Crohn's disease, has a custody hearing Monday in Garden City, Kansas.

Her boy was taken by authorities on March 24 after officials at his school reported comments he made about marijuana to child protection services.

Medical marijuana activist Shona Banda, 37, is fighting for custody of her 11-year-old son after his comments about marijuana at a school presentation prompted police to search her home

The Department of Children and Families in the small Midwestern town then contacted police who went to Banda's home, according to the Garden City Telegram.

She did not give authorities consent to search her home, but they returned several hours later with a warrant and discovered marijuana in plant, oil, joint, gel and capsule form along with  paraphernalia for the drug.

Two ounces of cannabis in plant form and one ounce of oil were reportedly seized. 

Video supposedly of the incident posted on Youtube shows officers arriving at Banda's house without a warrant, standing in her backyard and refusing to let the woman enter her house for fear that she could disturb evidence. 

'It is not public property, you don’t have a warrant,' Banda is heard telling the police of her backyard, but a sergeant responds that it 'doesn’t matter'.

The boy was given temporarily to his father, who is separated from Banda, but returned to state custody on Thursday ahead of the hearing.

No charges have yet been filed against the mother. 

Banda  wrote a book that detailed how she used cannabis oil to treat her debilitating Crohn's disease

'For him to have spoken up in class I can’t be upset about because he hears me daily on the phone talking with people, encouraging people to speak up and speak out,' she told Ben Swann of her son.

'My son says different things like, ‘My mom calls it cannabis and not marijuana,’ Banda said.

The mother, who was diagnosed with the inflammatory bowel disease Crohn's in the early 2000s, said that she had been losing weight and was 'on her death bed' before she began using cannabis oil in 2009.

Crohn's, where the body's immune system attacks the gastrointestinal system,  causes pain, diarrhea, menstrual problems, lack of appetite and fatigue.

Banda said that the marijuana worked much better than any medicines that had been prescribed for her and she was soon able to walk without a cane, she said in a YouTube video. 

She says that her son was pulled out of school and interrogated by police without her. 

A Go Fund Me page has raised more than $20,000 for Banda's legal defense.

Supporters plan on rallying outside the courthouse when the author goes in for her custody hearing on Monday.

Possession of any amount of marijuana is illegal in Kansas and can land offenders with up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. 

Repeat offenses are a felony and can lead to up to three and a half years behind bars, according to the Marijuana Policy Project.

Banda and her son had previously lived in Colorado, where marijuana is legal for recreational use, roughly one hour driving from Garden City.

A medical marijuana bill that would allow some patients to use cannabis oil was in the process of going through the Kansas state legislature earlier this year, according to the Kansas City Star. 

Twenty-four states have laws allowing medical marijuana, while four and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational use by adults.
