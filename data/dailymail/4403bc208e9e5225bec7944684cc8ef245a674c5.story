Commuters in Paris were left stunned after an unidentified man danced down the tracks of the Metro.

The mysterious man walked along the tracks at the station 'au naturel' and shocked workers at the end of the evening rush hour.

One passenger, who was on the Line 13 train at the Plaisance stop, took a picture of the man strolling along the tracks completely naked, The Local reports.

At around 7.30pm, the man climbed down on the tracks and pranced around before he was taken away by security.

'Our agents intervened straight away,' a spokesman for rail provider RATP told Le Parisien. 'This only lasted a few minutes.'

He is unidentified and no details about why he decided to go for the naked walk.

Last week, a naked woman surprised commuters on a Chicago train when she decided to 'drive the train' while in her birthday suit.

She jumped the turnstile and declared she was the ‘Goddess of the Train’ and planned to take the vehicle over.

The unidentified woman appeared at the Granville station of Chicago’s Red Line, the Chicago Transit Authority's busiest line.

She then slapped several commuters before heading to the front of the train.

The woman was taken to St Francis Hospital in Evanston for evaluation.

A police spokeswoman said the woman suffers from a mental illness, but would not specify which one.
