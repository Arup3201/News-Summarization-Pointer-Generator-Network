Charles Saatchi disliked credit cards so much he kept a ‘huge stash’ of cash in a plastic bag on the fridge, the court heard.

As yet more details of the couple’s astonishing lifestyle were revealed, Miss Lawson told the court that none of her personal assistants were authorised to make personal purchases or withdraw cash without her or Mr Saatchi’s permission.

She claimed she was not even allowed to take out money herself using the credit cards, and that Mr Saatchi used to leave cash around the house for her and their aides.

‘Charles kept a huge stash of cash above the fridge,’ Miss Lawson said.

‘He put it in a lunch plastic zippy freezer bag above the fridge. I think he did like a huge wad of cash because he didn’t like to use credit cards himself’.

Miss Lawson was in the witness box in the trial of Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo,who are accused of stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds from Miss Lawson and Mr Saatchi while in their service.

She was also quizzed about the large number of heavy outgoings made by her former assistants Alice Binks, Anzelle Wasserman, and Zoe Wales.

The trio were spending a monthly average of £6,000, £8,000, and £3,000 on trips to Annabel’s nightclub, the Babington House country venue, and on Christian Louboutin shoes.

Anthony Metzer QC, representing Elisabetta, asked Miss Lawson whether she had approved a £7,916 payment on Miss Binks’s company credit card to trendy east London private members’ club Shoreditch House in January last year.

Miss Lawson said that the payment was for her 53rd birthday party and another was for her daughter Mimi’s 18th birthday bash.

She also claimed that the other payments to Annabel’s nightclub in central London’s Mayfair were made to buy wine for Mr Saatchi.

The court heard that Mr Saatchi also told Miss Wasserman to make payments to online ticket vendor, Ticketstosee, worth thousands of pounds so his daughter Phoebe could attend sold-out concerts. ‘Ticketstosee is a company that gets tickets for quite hard to get to performers,’ Miss Lawson said. ‘So for example, Mr Saatchi instructed Ms Wales to get tickets for my step-daughter to see Kanye West.’

Prosecutors claim the Italian sisters lived the ‘high life’, spending the money on designer clothes and handbags from Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Vivienne Westwood.

Miss Lawson said she did offer to buy the sisters presents on special occasions and once allowed them to buy a pair of £60 shoes that she was buying for herself.

She said: ‘Afterwards I thought they must have been laughing at me, £60, what is that to them?’ Miss Lawson refuted Mr Metzer’s claim that she would use credit cards belonging to Mr Saatchi to pay for exercise classes, manicures and pedicures. I paid for them sometimes by cash and sometimes by cheque,’ she said, adding: ‘Personal trainers don’t take credit cards.’

In relation to whether she bought gifts for Elisabetta, who is known as Lisa, she said: ‘She might say, “Look at these shoes in Vogue” and I would say, “You know, darling, let me buy you those shoes”.’

But she said it would be a particular gift. Questioned by Mr Metzer about her other personal assistants’ credit card statements showing expenditure at Annabel’s in central London, Miss Lawson said it referred not to the nightclub but to Annabel’s wine cellar ‘for Mr Saatchi’s wine’.

Mr Metzer mentioned sums including £1,368, and a separate sum of £1,300 which he said was spent in five days at the establishment.

‘Mr Saatchi likes to drink wine and he likes to drink expensive wine,’ she said.

Questioned by Mr Metzer about payments made on a Vodafone account and a private medical payment made by another assistant, Miss Lawson said she did not realise the other witnesses in the trial were “under suspicion”.

The court heard that a sum of £7,916.10 was spent in Shoreditch House, which Miss Lawson said she presumed was her birthday party. Miss Lawson was questioned about money spent at upmarket clothing store Joseph of London on dresses bought for her by Mr Saatchi. ‘Mr Saatchi very generously said, “I want you to have lots of them”,’ she said, adding that he ‘wanted to buy up every single one of those dresses’.

Embarrassingly for Miss Lawson it emerged that one payment of £2,300 on the Mr Saatchi credit card given to her assistant Alice Binks had been for a beauty treatment a lady does not normally discuss in public – and it seemed to have been for Miss Lawson.

Asked what the payment to a Dr Andrew Markie could be for, Miss Lawson said: ‘Laser hair removal. It wasn’t for her.’

Miss Lawson admitted at one point: ‘I’m guilty of being extravagant’, depite spending only a fraction of the sums attained by the Grillo sisters on the family credit cards.

But she also gave an intriguing insight into Mr Saatchi’s courtship of her a decade ago – when it seems the £100million tycoon failed to pay the bill for their dates, leaving her to pick up the bill.

Miss Lawson let it slip while explaining why her ex-husband was happy to pay for a lot of her purchases in recent years.

Miss Lawson said: ‘He was very generous, and if it wasn’t a business purchase for me he was happy to fund it -–particularly as I had spent a long period with the restaurants that we went to and everything on my card, and he wanted to redress that.’

The court has heard that Miss Lawson and Mr Saatchi paid Francesca £28,000 a year while Lisa earned £25,000.

Yet
 Francesca’s spending between 2008 and June last year totaled over 
£580,000, with her older sister Lisa’s spree during the same time frame 
hitting an estimated £105,000.

On average Francesca’s monthly outgoings were £48,000 while Lisa’s were £28,000.

Rahul
 Gajjar, the finance director at the Saatchi Gallery Group, has 
previously told the court that he kept increasing the Grillos’ monthly 
limit once he received Mr Saatchi’s approval. But he did not tell Mr 
Saatchi or Miss Lawson that he had raised Francesca’s card limit to 
£100,000 a month.

Accused: Lisa and Francesca Grillo

In better times, Elizabetta Grillo was Nigella Lawson’s ‘rock’.

Yesterday, the 41-year-old wept in the dock at Isleworth Crown Court as the TV cook told how she had loved her and would never forget what she had done for her.

But the celebrity chef was also frank in saying that things had changed dramatically.Both Elisabetta and her sister Francesca, 35, had ‘flabbergasted’ Miss Lawson by stealing a fortune from her and her ex-husband Charles Saatchi – a sum she estimated to be ‘a lot higher’ than the £685,000 they are accused of taking.

And Miss Lawson said Elisabetta, known as Lisa and who first came to work for her when her first husband John Diamond was dying of cancer, had compounded her crime by falsely accusing her of being addicted to cocaine.

Miss Lawson said: ‘Lisa had been a stalwart and had helped me through a very difficult time when my first husband died. I loved Lisa. My children loved Lisa. She was a rock. I would have done anything for her.’

But her ‘fantasist’ sister Francesca also started working for the family and may have influenced her as she began stealing, said Miss Lawson.

She said ‘a strange sense of entitlement’ seemed to be behind the alleged frauds. Miss Lawson added: ‘I would like Lisa to admit to what she’s done.’
