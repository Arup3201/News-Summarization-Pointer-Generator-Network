The charges brought by the ECB against Lou Vincent and Naved Arif are the beginning of the end of a story that unfolded three years ago in sleepy Hove — 4,500 miles away from the global epicentre of match-fixing in Mumbai.

If the charges are upheld, both men are likely to be banned for life.

The case against Vincent has been one of the worst-kept secrets in cricket. Sportsmail revealed back in December that he was under investigation by the ICC’s anti-corruption unit, while the details of his involvement with cricket’s underworld were laid bare in this newspaper last week.

In the dock: Former New Zealand batsman Lou Vincent has been charged with match fixing

The only surprise is that it has taken the authorities so long to bring charges against a player who has admitted to fixing matches as long ago as 2008.

Arif’s alleged involvement was less well-known. A left-arm seamer whose 43-match first-class career produced an impressive 181 wickets at just 24 apiece for Pakistan sides Gujranwala and Sialkot, as well as Sussex, he is understood allegedly to have approached Vincent to enlist his help in fixing the 40-over game against Kent in August 2011.

It was that match, as well as Sussex’s Twenty20 game against Lancashire in the same month, that has formed the basis of the charges laid by the ECB. In the game against Kent, Sportsmail understands that it is suggested that Vincent and Arif wore black sweatbands to indicate the fix was on.

Chasing 217 to win, Sussex had raced to 76 without loss after 10 overs, and looked well on course for victory. Vincent, who has revealed the full extent of his involvement with match-fixing to the ACSU in what amounts to a plea bargain, came in at No 3 and was run out for a single, made from seven balls.

Arif, who had allegedly persuaded Vincent to partake in the fix three days earlier during the drive north to Scarborough for a game against Yorkshire, arrived in the middle at No 9 with Sussex needing 74 off 13.4 overs. To the consternation of the Sussex dressing-room, Arif made 11 off 29 balls — a major factor in Kent’s eventual 14-run victory. He had earlier taken no wicket for 41 runs in six overs.

Key role: Naved Arif's slow batting and poor bowling played a large part in Sussex's defeat

The bookie said to have organised the fix, ‘NG’, was reportedly at the match, and spoke to Vincent on the boundary when he was fielding, having apparently grown nervous at the fast start made by the Sussex openers. NG and Vincent had met each other, along with Arif, the previous night in a Brighton hotel, where Vincent had told NG he would take part in the fix.

To collect his payment for helping throw the game — said to be £40,000 — Vincent had to supply the serial code of a £20 note to another bookie, known as ‘VG’, who was in on the scam. Vincent then met two men near Heathrow airport, and confirmed his identity by handing over the £20 note and undergoing a voice-recognition test.

Suspicion immediately focused on the match because of the huge amounts of money placed on the outcome — £14m, more than twice the normal figure for a televised county game.

Suspicious: Eyebrows were raised when £14million was placed on the match

On the community forum for the betting exchange Betfair, there was a running commentary, with several posters apparently aware when wickets would fall. This became key evidence for the ECB. In early 2012, under Chris Watts, the board’s anti-corruption chief who had started six months earlier, players were interviewed, betting data was analysed and betting experts were canvassed.

There had been dismay among the ECB anti-corruption team that the ICC had cleared the game. One source said: ‘We couldn’t understand it. It was obvious the game needed to be looked at.’

But the situation may have been complicated by the fact that, at the time, Vincent told Sussex he had been approached to fix the game — but had turned it down. With no names passed on to the ICC, the investigation went nowhere, until it emerged in 2012 that Vincent had been interviewed about the game.

Dismay: The ECB anti-corruption team could not believe the ICC initially cleared the match

The case was then reopened, leading to Thursday’s charges — though the ECB’s anti-corruption officials were close to charging the players last spring. A conviction would be a major feather in the ECB’s cap, especially in the light of accusations of ineffectiveness aimed at the ICC’s own anti-corruption unit — accusations that the ICC chief executive David Richardson angrily denied.

On Thursday, the managing director of the England team Paul Downton told Test Match Special: ‘It’s an enormous concern — match-fixing is potentially a cancer for any sport. It is something the ECB takes extremely seriously.’

That last sentence is the kind of message cricket fans are longing to hear — and probably should have heard several years ago.
