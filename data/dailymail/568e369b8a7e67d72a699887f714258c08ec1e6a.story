He may be suspended from this Saturday's Champions League final, but Real Madrid's Xabi Alonso looked in good spirits in training on Monday.

The Spain midfielder, 32, nutmegged three-time World Player of the Year and Real assistant coach Zinedine Zidane in a passing drill at the club's Valdebebas training ground in the Spanish capital. 

Real will be hampered by Alonso's ban when they take on city rivals Atletico Madrid in Lisbon on Saturday.

High five: Zidane sees the funny side as he acknowledges Alonso's achievement

Atletico clinched their first La Liga title for 18 years last weekend by earning a draw at Barcelona and will no doubt be buoyed by the absence of Alonso.

The ex-Liverpool midfielder is likely to be replaced by 24-year-old Asier Illarramendi.

One player who will be involved as Real look to win their 10th European Cup - La Decima - is Gareth Bale.

‘It would be a dream to win it,’ said Bale, who will be a major threat alongside Cristiano Ronaldo.
