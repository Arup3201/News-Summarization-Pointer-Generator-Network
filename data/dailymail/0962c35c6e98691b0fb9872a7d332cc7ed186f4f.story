Loss: Audrie Pott, 15, killed herself last year after she was allegedly sexually assaulted at a party

One of the teenage boys accused in the sexual assault and cyber-bullying case that led to Audrie Pott's suicide is now claiming that her parents are also to blame for the 15-year-old's tragic hanging.

The attorney for the boy, 16, filed court papers at the end of December that state that Lawrence and Sheila Pott share responsibility for their daughter's death in September 2012.

The teenager killed herself after three classmates allegedly sexually assaulted her and circulated photos of the sickening attack.

Pott, from Saratoga, California, took her life in after sending Facebook messages to the boys who allegedly assaulted her at an alcohol-fueled party.

Now one of the boys is stating that her parents have partial responsibility in the case, as reported by SFGate.com.

The document, filed by attorney Philip Pereira, says that Lawrence and Sheila Pott failed to act on the girl's 'long-standing and serious emotional problems before her suicide and they should have sought professional help.'

The filing also mentions an 'altercation' between Audrie and two of her friends shortly before her death.

Robert Allard, the parents' attorney reacted angrily to the assertions.

He released a statement reading: 'The sole issue in this case is the callous behavior of the 
suspects which directly led to Audrie's unnecessary death.

'Since this 
lawsuit was filed, it has become quite clear to us that the suspects 
refuse to accept responsibility or show remorse for their actions.'

Heartbroken: Larry Pott and Audrie's stepmother Lisa believe that the bullying at school led to the tragedy. Now one of the accused boys claims they are partly to blame

SFGate.com reported that Allard described the document as 'a revolting attempt to deflect 
responsibility away from his clients.

This case is and will always be 
about the tragic consequences associated with sexual assault and cyber 
bullying.'

Three boys who attended Saratoga high school with Pott have been charged in juvenile court and also face a wrongful death lawsuit from the girl's parents.

Pott desperately pleaded with the boys to delete the images in the days before her death, has emerged last year.

Cruel: Pott, right, was allegedly assaulted after a night of drinking  and boys spread photos of the attack

'I swear to god if u still have those
 pictures illl killl u [sic],' she wrote to one of her alleged attackers
 in the days after the party. 'It's gonna get out.'

Another male classmate responded: 'lol that s*** gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah.'

Pott
 was found hanging in the bathroom of her mother's home on September 12,
 2012 after the explicit photographs had allegedly led to bullying at 
school.

Her devastated 
parents blame her death on the horrific sexual attack a week earlier at 
the hands of three teenage boys who then allegedly tried to cover up 
their involvement.

On 
the night of the attack, a group of teenagers were at a friend's house 
drinking heavily. The girl who lived at the house threw the party when 
her parents left town.

Three male classmates allegedly 
helped an inebriated Audrie to a bedroom before stripping her naked, drawing over her 
body and sexually assaulting her.

Grieving: Audrie's mother, Sheila Pott, found her daughter hanging in the bathroom in September 2012

Audrie Pott wrote a series of desperate Facebook messages before her death that have been excerpted in Rolling Stone. In one exchange, she speaks to one of her alleged attackers:

AUDRIE: i need to talk to u.

BOY: What

AUDRIE: one word... marker

BOY: What about marker

AUDRIE: u know what im talking about... i dont remeber anything about that... [A friend] had to tell me everything... i swear to god if u still have those pictures illl killl u

BOY: They are deleted and I didn't take them I promise it wasn't me... And I'm sorry about the marker

AUDRIE: You have no idea what it's like to be a girl

An exchange with another classmate:

CLASSMATE: lol that shit gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah

AUDRIE: oh my god... i f***ing hate people... Do you know how people view me now?... I now have a reputation I can never get rid of.

AUDRIE: My life is over... I ruined my life and I don't even remember how.

In police interviews, the teenagers admitted 
to coloring half of her face black with marker, then 
pulling down her bra, taking off her shorts and drawing on her breasts and near her genitals.

They
 allegedly photographed themselves sexually assaulting her and, by the 
time she started her sophomore year at Saratoga High School two days 
later, scores of students had seen the images.

Rolling Stone magazine has
 revealed the torment Audrie suffered in the days before her death and 
has detailed the messages she exchanged with her alleged attackers, whom
 she had known since middle school.

She messaged one boy, vowing to kill him if he still had the images.

'They are deleted and I didn't take them,' he wrote. 'I promise it wasn't me.'

'I'm sorry about the marker,' he added of the drawings that covered her body.

She also messaged another boy who had been at the party to ask if one of the teenagers had photographs of her.

'ur fine,' he responded. 'ill make sure nothing goes around.'

She replied: 'It's gonna get out. S*** always does. Especially with the people who were there.'

And in an even more concerning exchange, one of her classmates sent her a message reading: 'lol that s*** gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah.'

'My life is over... I ruined my life and I don't even remember how,' one of her final messages read. 'You have no idea what it's like to be a girl.'

When she returned to school, she missed classes to avoid people and had an argument with one of her closest friends, Kathy Atabakhsh, who accused her of becoming a different person.

'She had been, literally, the best person
 you could meet – always honest and trustworthy,' Kathy told Rolling Stone. 'And I was so upset that she had 
changed. It was hard for her to hear that from a close friend.'

Another girl loudly pointed out in class that Audrie had been cutting herself, and the teenager burst out crying. She told friends she had cut herself on a vase.
