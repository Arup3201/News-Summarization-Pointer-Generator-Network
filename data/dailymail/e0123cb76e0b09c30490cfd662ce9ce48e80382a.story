Nigel Farage is set to appear alongside some to the United States' most high-profile conservative politicians at a conference in Washington tomorrow.

The Ukip leader will address activists immediately after the darling of the Tea Party movement Sarah Palin. 

The annual Conservative Political Action Conference is attended by leading Republican politicians as well as gun activists, anti-abortion campaigners and evangelical Christians.  

Nigel Farage, who has developed a cult following in the States after regular TV appearances on Fox News, will address the annual Conservative Political Action Conference tonight

Visitors to the summit are sometimes handed plastic foetuses by activists to show their opposition to abortion.

Tea Party supporters – who favour a dramatic reduction in the size of the State – also walk the halls in uniforms from the 18th-century American Revolutionary War.

But the Ukip leader, who has developed a cult following in the States after regular TV appearances on Fox News, defended his decision to appear at the conference.

He said: 'There are parts of the American Conservative movement that I get on well with and other parts not so well with. 'We have learned quite a lot from some of them in terms of campaigning techniques, many of which we put into use in Rochester.

'Some of the very hard-line religious stuff is not where I'm going with politics and I often find myself disagreeing about interventionist foreign policies.' 

Mr Farage is expected to tell the gathered activists that unless they reclaim the Republican Party they 'might have to do a Ukip' and break off.

The Ukip leader has been given a super-star build-up for the annual gathering at the Gaylord National Resort in Maryland, near Washington DC.

PR agents promoting the event have described him as a 'political tour de force' who has 'emerged as a serious and viable candidate who can run England in the near future'.

Mr Farage will appear after Mrs Palin, the former Alaska governor who rose to prominence after being chosen as Senator John McCain's running mate in the 2008 Presidential race against Barack Obama.

The Ukip leader will also rub shoulders with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker - a frontrunner for the Republican Presidential nomination next year - who wants to 'prioritise' the end of universal healthcare introduce by President Obama.

Mr Farage will also be joined by Wayne LaPierre, the head of the pro-gun National Rifle Association.

Speaking after one of the recent multiple killings in the US, Mr LaPierre said: 'The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.'
