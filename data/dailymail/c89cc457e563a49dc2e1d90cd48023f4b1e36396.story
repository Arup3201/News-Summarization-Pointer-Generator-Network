Jose Mourinho has come out swinging after a week in which Chelsea suffered a desperate Champions League exit, by declaring he is still the special one.

Days after facing a barrage of criticism for the manner of Chelsea’s defeat by Paris Saint-Germain, Mourinho has hit back by bragging that there are a mere handful of managers around the world who can measure up to him.

‘When I compare myself with other managers I see just a few that are with me in terms of success,’ he said. ‘The others I see a huge distance.’

It was a defiant broadside from the colourful Portuguese boss, who vowed that Wednesday’s disaster against ten-man PSG — in which his team were branded ‘babies’ — will simply spark a Premier League title charge.

‘With Chelsea, I lost against Barcelona in the last 16 and we were champions that season,’ he said. ‘It was a fantastic season for us.

‘I think it’s the target for everyone, all the big teams at the beginning of the season. It’s the main target. If you can win that, I think it’s fantastic.’

Speaking before Burnley beat Manchester City on Saturday, Mourinho added: ‘I think we need nine victories; 11 matches. If our direct opponents lose a couple of points, then you need eight victories and one draw or something like that.’

Asked about the prospect of winning a third Champions League title, having already won it at Porto and Inter, Mourinho said: ‘It is wrong to assume that. People are too worried about me. They don’t know what my happiness is.

‘My happiness, first of all, is when I compare myself with the other managers. This is not a fight with them and I have lots of respect for all of them. 

'But in the Premier League, who is European champion? Me and Van Gaal. In the Premier League, how many has won it twice or more than twice? Mr Wenger and myself. 

How many has won every competition in this country? How many?

‘You go to Europe, how many won seven league titles? How many has won two Champions Leagues? Carlo Ancelotti has won three and Pep Guardiola has two. You are too worried about me.

‘In the league, we can count the victories we need on the fingers of two hands — one month ago we couldn’t do that, we didn’t have enough fingers. 

'There will be a moment where we need five victories, we need four victories and one hand will be enough to count them. 

'I think this is a good way to do it. Don’t think about Man City, don’t think about Arsenal. Just think about us.'
