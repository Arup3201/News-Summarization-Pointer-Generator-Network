This is the moment a young-at-heart father became an internet sensation - by downing beer from a rugby boot at his son's university housewarming party.

Phil Justice was hailed as a 'legend' and a 'hero' among students in Exeter, Devon after his son Henry posted up footage of his exploits.

The six second video shows Mr Justice tiling the boot back as he is egged on by a group of students in the room - before wincing as he completes the challenge.

Onlookers can be heard shrieking with joy as he gulps down the drink while holding a beer bottle in his other hand.

The Tab reports that the father and son were in Exeter in Freshers' Week to help Henry move in to his second year house.

They had been to the rugby for the day and enjoyed a few drinks before heading back to find a house party in full swing.

It was at this point that he found himself having to adhere to his son's house drinking rules.

Henry, a University if Exeter student, later took to Twitter to express his surprise that the clip had not received more 'likes' on Facebook.

He wrote: 'The fact that people talking about their holidays can get more likes on facebook than my dad seeing off a pint out of a shoe astounds me.'
