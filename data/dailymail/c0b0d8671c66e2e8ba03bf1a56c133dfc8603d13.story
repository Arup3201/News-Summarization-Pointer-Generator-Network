Racegoers will today be hoping for the luck of the Irish as the Cheltenham Festival celebrates St Patrick's Day four days early.

Spectators were a sea of emerald green as they descended on Prestbury Park, with Guinness hats and even Irish fairy outfits dotted among the crowd.

The look is a far cry from Ladies Day yesterday, which saw racegoers clad in fur, feathers and tailored tweed descend on the historic race course, where the public were joined by the Duchess of Cornwall, her son Tom Parker-Bowles, along with new mother Zara Phillips, Princess Anne and Autumn Phillips.

One lady worked the green theme of the day in a fashion-conscious manner, teaming a tailored emerald 
jacket with an elaborate peacock fascinator hat

Guinness o'clock! Not everyone adopted the Irish theme today, with many simply choosing to enjoy a beer in celebration

Margaret Connolly, from Mullingar, paired her green four leaf clover fairy wings with an all-in-one outfit, including a fur bowler hat and Irish flag

However the jovial mood of the crowd today is much the same as the high spirits seen at the first two days, as visitors soak in the atmosphere and indulge in a few beers.

Also similar to Tuesday and Wednesday is the numbers taking advantage of Cheltenham’s considerably more lax dress code than its Royal cousin Ascot.

As well as green body suits and fairy wings, some young ladies chose to wear some very mini skirts.

The racecourse was ablaze with green today as Cheltenham celebrates St Patrick's Day, despite the official date being Monday 17

These enthusiasts broke away from the Guinness hats, choosing ones adorned with buckles and bells instead

Teamed with four-leaf clover over the knee socks, oversized green bow ties or a fur trimmed bright green bowler hat, subtly was clearly not the aim of the game for some.

And while it was mainly the women leading the way in the outlandish fashion stakes, with most men making do with a Guinness top hat as a nod to the Irish theme, one gentleman was the subject of some  double takes as he arrived with hundreds of race passes across the country attached to his binoculars.

As well as those who chose to honour the Irish theme, there were many who kept to the more traditional fashions of  Cheltenham, with some top to toe fur making an appearance

Tweed remained popular among 
racegoers on day three of the Cheltenham Festival

Today features plenty of Irish-style entertainment at Cheltenham including the St Patrick’s Derby, a charity flat race which raises money for Cancer Research UK.

Over the last three years, in excess of £840,000 has been raised at the festival and the charity race will once again be taking place as the centrepiece of the fundraising on St Patrick’s Thursday.

The grey skies haven't lessened the fun or nail-biting racing today, with tomorrow promising more nerve wracking riding on Gold Cup Day

 titfers: Glamorous hats were all over the racecourse at Cheltenham 
Festival today with everything from dainty pillboxes to pheasant 
feathered fascinators on display

They came bearing binoculars, their 
tweed coats and shiny patent leather boots accessorised with glamorous 
diamond studs and ropes of pearls as racing got underway on Ladies Day 
at the Cheltenham Festival.

Others
 sported vast fur cossack hats of the sort beloved of Pippa Middleton, 
while more still embraced jaunty headgear inspired by the glorious 
surrounding countryside and festooned with British blooms and pheasant 
feathers.

But while some got
 the look spot on, others appeared to have taken the country chic look 
too far with a bizarre Musketeers-inspired ensemble complete with 
leather gauntlets and a set of bottom-scraping tweed minis among the low
 points.

Colourful:
 Lystra Adams - who attended today too - shows off her elaborately decorated straw top hat which 
came complete with a bouquet of straw roses and a huge spray of feathers

Staffordshire opts for striking head-to-toe print while Zara York from 
Somerset combines a fur bolero with a fabulous hat
