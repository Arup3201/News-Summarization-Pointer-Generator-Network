Around 1 in 10 people in the UK feel lonely more than half of the time, a new study into the nation’s happiness.

The Office for National Statistics found having more friends makes people feel more satisfied with their life, while most people think they can rely on their family and partner.

But people who feel lonely are more likely to think that their life is not worthwhile and feel they are left out of society.

Almost half of people (48 per cent) who feel lonely all of the time also feel left out of society, while a third (32.5 per cent) disagree with the idea that what they do in life is worthwhile

A quarter of people with no close friends reported being mostly, somewhat or completely dissatisfied about their life

The happiness survey was launched by David Cameron to assess the state of the nation beyond economic factors.

The ONS examined surveys on loneliness and happiness using the latest data available.

It shows that 11 per cent of people in the UK felt lonely all, most, or more than half of the time in 2011-12.

Almost half of people (48 per cent) who feel lonely all of the time also feel left out of society, while a third (32.5 per cent) disagree with the idea that what they do in life is worthwhile.

By contrast, only 6.8 per cent of people who never feel lonely feel left out.

The ONS said: ‘One important aspect of personal relationships is the size of people’s networks such as the number of close friends.

‘Most people (95 per cent) reported having at least one close friend, with a majority (68%) having between 2 and 6 close friends.’

Some 1.5 per cent of people think they cannot rely on their partner at all, while 3.4 per cent said the same of their friends and 4.6 per cannot count on their family

People rate their family life more highly than their social life, the analysis by the Office for National Statistics shows

The proportion of people who are dissatisfied life increases as the number of close friends falls.

A quarter of people with no close friends reported being mostly, somewhat or completely dissatisfied about their life.

But the figure falls to 21 per cent of those with one close friend, 17 per cent of those with 2-6 close friends and 14 per cent of those having more than 10 close friends.

Just over a third of people in the UK reported that they wish they could spend more time with their family (36 per cent) and have more social contacts (36 per cent) in 2011-12.

A large majority reported being in touch, by phone or in person, with their closest friend very regularly, either on most days (34 per cent), or at least once a week (38 per cent).

However, the ONS warned that social exclusion is a ‘growing concern’, adding: ‘There was a strong relationship between loneliness and other negative experiences, such as feeling left out of society, feeling that things done in life are not worthwhile and feeling a lack of recognition by others. 

Some 1.5 per cent of people think they cannot rely on their partner at all, while 3.4 per cent said the same of their friends and 4.6 per cent cannot count on their family.
