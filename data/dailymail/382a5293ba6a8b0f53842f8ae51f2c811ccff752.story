The president discussed the worrying number of shootings, which have taken place in the city, and the tragic death of another young girl, Hadiya Pendleton, 15, an honors student who was murdered in a case of mistaken identity days after performing in his inauguration.

Destini returned to her family's South Lowe Avenue home on Friday evening with the president's words still echoing her ears, Pendleton's parents had also been there to hear his speech.

'What happened to Hadiya is not unique, it's not unique to Chicago, it's not unique to this country. Too many of our children are being taken away from us.' the President said.

'Last year there were 443 murders with a firearm on the streets of this city. 65 of those murders were 18 and under that's the equivalent of a Newtown every four months...These [gun control] proposals deserve a vote in Congress.'

Today Destini took to Facebook to speak of her family's grief  as they became the latest Chicago home to be torn apart by gun violence.

'We have Baby Jayden to remember Janay my sister's last words were "My Baby ... My Baby . I just wish I cam have her back or at least to say goodbye, she wrote. 'I need her. I finally figured out that I'm not dreaming she's actually gone. My whole world is upside down.'

The two sisters excitedly discussed the President's visit in Destini's room the night before, she was sitting on a bench a short distance from the President when he spoke.

North Chicago police said today that two people are being questioned in connection with McFarlane's death. No charges have been filed.

The girls mother, Angela Blakely, told NBC the bullet was intended for someone else and her daughter was yet another victim caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.

'It's terrible. It's terrible. The only thing I can remember is my daughter telling me, 'Mommy, it's so sad about Hadiya. That makes no sense,'  she told the Chicago Tribune.
