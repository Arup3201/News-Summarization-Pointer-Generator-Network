From the glamour of the roaring '20s to the short skirts and Teddy Boys of the swinging '60s, Cecil Beaton captured it all.

Now a new exhibition at Wilton House in Wiltshire is to unveil previously unseen images from his -  and Sotheby's - archives.

Described
 as ‘a worldly Peter Pan who never aged’, Beaton regularly worked for Vogue and Vanity Fair and made his name documenting the antics of the aristocracy, royals and Hollywood stars.

Clowning about: Stephen Tennant, William Walton, Georgia Sitwell, Zita Jungman,Rex Whistler and Cecil Beaton

Writer: Edith Maud Olivier MBE, was photographed by Beaton dressed as Queen Elizabeth I in 1932

But although his subjects included some of the brightest stars of the era, photographing London's youthful bohemian set, known at the time as Bright Young Things, became his passion.

Among them were members of the aristocratic Pembroke family, the owners of Wilton Hall and the stars of the new exhibition.

Curated by designer Jasper Conran, the works are a vivid portrait of country house parties and costume balls, and there's even a rare glimpse of the entertainment laid on for the troops billeted at Wilton during World War II.

One particularly charming image shows Maud Olivier dressed, rather incongruously, as a severe Elizabeth I, complete with layers of white panstick make-up.

Ms Olivier, a long-standing friend of Beaton and the Pembrokes, was a brilliant writer and society hostess, and was given an MBE for helping create the Wiltshire Women's Land Army during the First World War.

Beaton 
himself was no slouch when it came to writing, and published his first 
collection of works in 1930 with The Book of Beauty.

By 1937, such was his success that he was selected to photograph the
 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in 1937 and Queen Elizabeth 
herself in 1939.

His love for costumery and flair for 
fancy dress earned him Tony Awards for My Fair Lady (1957) and Coco 
(1970) and Oscars for Gigi (1958) and the big screen adaptation of My 
Fair Lady (1964).

But
 it is for his high society portraits that he is most famous, and 
unsurprisingly, the parties held at his Wiltshire home, Ashcombe, were 
legendary among his aristocratic friends.

Fancy dress featured heavily and his costume balls became the highlight of the Wiltshire social calendar.

One guest who was no stranger to dressing up was the Countess of Pembroke, who appears in the photos sporting an elaborate costume for her role in 'Heil Cinderella' - a pantomime co-written by Beaton in 1939 for the troops stationed at Wilton during World War II.

In it, Beaton played one of the Ugly Sisters while the famously beautiful Countess of Pembroke took the role of the Queen.

Other highlights include a charming self-portrait of Cecil on the Palladian Bridge at Wilton House taken in September 1968 and a striking image of him cavorting with friends, Stephen Tennant, William Walton, Georgia Sitwell, Zita Jungman and Rex Whistler at Wilsford in 1927.

Despite
 being pushed into a river at the first Ball he attended there in 1927, 
Beaton later became great friends with the Earls of Pembroke.

Over
 time he photographed and chronicled the lives of three generations of 
the family in the surroundings of the house which he described as 
‘perhaps the most wonderful piece in all Wiltshire’s heritage of 
domestic architecture.’

On
 14th January 1980, just three days before his death, Beaton celebrated 
his 76th birthday with a lunch party hosted by the family.

Cecil Beaton at Wilton runs until 14th September. For more information, see wiltonhouse.co.uk
