Eljero Elia scored his first goals in English football to give Southampton a 2-1 win away at Newcastle on Saturday night.

The 27-year-old gave the visitors the lead on 14 minutes with a low, blistering strike that beat Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul.

The hosts drew level when Yoan Gouffran fortuitously deflected a Florin Gardos clearance into the net 15 minutes later.

However, Elia had the last laugh just after the hour mark when his shot deflected off Daryl Janmaat to restore their advantage.

They've done it! Southampton go above Manchester United and back into third place in the Premier League table.

Eljero Elia's double was enough for Saints, who had been pegged back after a bizarre goal from Yoan Gouffran in the first half.

Fonte handles the ball inside his own area, Newcastle players surround the referee but their pleas are ignored. I've seen those given...

I'm not sure Remy Cabella will ever come good for NUFC. He's weak, slowand& hasn't got a trick (which works). And this has been one of his better games...

Long is left in a heap after a challenge but there's no free-kick and a drop ball is played. Four minutes of added time to be played.

The visitors are showing very little ambition - understandably so - in these last few minutes. Colback wins it back in the middle of midfield to start yet another attack.

More possession and more balls into the box from Newcastle but still no breakthrough. Saints are heading everything clear and blocking every through ball. 

Another dangerous ball from Colback - this time from a free-kick 35 yards out - is headed out for a corner. Newcastle take it quickly but Cabella's shot is well wide. 

Elia will not complete his hat-trick today - the winger has gone off for youngster Matt Targett.

Mike Williamson replaces Dummett with 10 minutes to go.

Pelle comes within six inches of sealing three points but his header - from a brilliant Clyne cross - smashed Krul's bar before being hoofed clear. So close.

The hosts are whipping more and more balls into Southampton's area as the game goes on and the latest almost gave them an equaliser. Dummett got his head to a Colback cross but somehow managed to head wide from just a few yards.

He's been a nuisance for Newcastle's defence all evening and Pelle has just proved his worth at the other end of the pitch. The Italian flicked away an inswinging corner from Colback with Forster under pressure.

Newcastle have turned to Sammy Ameobi to rescue something here. I watched United's reserves earlier in the week and Ameobi - who is just back from a knee injury - looked very sharp. John Carver will be hoping he and Emmanuel Riviere - still without a league goal for the club - can help salvage at least a point.

Newcastle bring on Sammy Ameobi and Emmanuel Riviere for Anita and Gouffran.

Daryl Janmaat had been talking to Dutch compatriot Eljero Elia just moments before he gifted the Southampton winger his second of the match. It was certainly very pally of Janmaat to allow Elia to rob him of the ball before poking past Tim Krul, another Holland international.

Steven Davis gets booked for dragging back Anita. 

Just like his first, Elia gets a goal out of nothing. The Dutchman ran onto a flick from Shane Long, bundled his way past Janmaat and unleashed a shot which took a wicked deflection off the Newcastle man to beat Krul. 2-1 to Southampton. 

A superb cross from Haidara was met by Gouffran but the Frenchman could only flick his header wide of Forster's right-hand post. He'll be frustrated with that.

Shane Long and Jack Cork replace Tadic and Ward-Prowse with 30 minutes left on the clock.

More good work from Clyne down Southampton's right side. The England man fired in a cross after a good run but Coloccini got his head on it to clear the danger.

Looks like Southampton will make their first substitution shortly, although it's not yet clear who is coming on. Koeman clearly feels his side need something different to go on and win this game.

Sissoko heads the ball across to Cabella on the edge of Southampton's area but the midfielder's volley ended up well over Forster's bar. It was a tricky chance but he should've kept it down.

The visitors are looking assured in possession, knocking it around their back-four and trying to play their way through Newcastle. The hosts, on the other hand, look more at home using their width on the counter-attack. Difficult to tell which way this one is going to go.

A nice piece of skill from Pelle on the left almost sets Ward-Prowse away but Newcastle snuff out the danger. St James' Park crowd very quiet in the opening minutes of the second half.

Yoan Gouffran's fortunate goal sees Newcastle go in level after Eljero Elia's first strike fr Southampton. All to play for after the break.

Sissoko wins a corner for the hosts but it comes to nothing. Saints look happy to see the opening period out as it is.

Southampton break through Elia after another weak penalty shout for a Fonte handball but Newcastle win the ball back and immediately go on the attack. Perez latches onto a precise ball over the top but he couldn't direct his first-time effort on target. 

Howls of anger from the St James' Park faithful as Sissoko goes down in the box after a tackle from Clyne. The England man did get a touch on the ball though. Correct decision not to award a penalty.

Gouffran attempts to score his second goal of the game - and first he intended - but his 30-yard effort is miles over the bar. He'd have been better off passing, there.

John Carver certainly let Dusan Tadic know exactly what he thought about the Serb's attempt to get Massadio Haidara booked. At one point I thought he was going to enter the pitch and drag Tadic to his feet. From the resulting free-kick the Southampton winger was flagged offside, much to Carver's satisfaction...

Haidara goes in hard on Tadic by the touchline but manages to escape a booking. Moments later the Saints midfielder is involved with the referee himself.

Bizarre equaliser for Newcastle. Florin Gardos slid in to try and clear the ball but diverted it onto the net of Yoan Gouffran and into an empty net. Huge slice of luck for Carver's men.

Ward-Prowse's wicked free-kick from out on the right found the head of Jose Fonte but the big defender could only direct his header over the bar. He'll be disappointed with that after getting away from the clutches of Fabricio Coloccini.

At the other end Gouffran is flagged for offside.

The visitors work the ball down the right, Tadic crosses but Pelle can't get on the end of it. Southampton have really settled into the game now.

I once scored a penalty past Fraser Forster during a kickabout when he was a teenager at the club's academy. He did, however, recover from that humiliation and is currently keeping his old club at bay. He really is a top keeper and, for me, should be England's No 1.

Lots more possession for the Saints since Elia's goal, which was completely against the run of play. That strike seems to have given Koeman's men a shot of confidence and they're now knocking the ball about with some style.

Out of nowhere Southampton take the lead through new boy Eljero Elia. A long ball was knocked down by Pelle to Ward-Prowse, who picked out the run of Elia with a perfectly-weighted pass. The Dutchman made no mistake from 12 yards but Krul will feel he should've done better.

Another decent move from Newcastle ends with the ball at the feet of Ayoze Perez. The former Tenerife man got a shot away but Fraser Forster was down low to make a comfortable save.

Koeman's men are closing down quickly and keeping their shape as you'd expect but they're struggling to keep hold of the ball for more than a few passes. Pelle very isolated so far.

The hosts are enjoying the majority of possession in the early stages, with Cabella getting on the ball three or four times down the right already. He looks to be in the mood, just like he was at Chelsea last week.

Newcastle have started reasonably brightly here. Their second chance of the game fell to right back Daryl Janmaat, whose low strike looked to be on target before it was blocked.

Masadio Haidara just let the ball run under his foot for a Saints throw. Caretaker boss John Carver could be seen in the background telling his players to relax. Wise words.

A typically powerful run through the middle from Moussa Sissoko ends with the ball reaching Remy Cabella out on the right. The Frenchman found Vernon Anita with his cut-back but the midfielder's shot was sliced terribly and almost went out for a throw-in before the ball was kept in.

Don't under-estimate the significance of this game for John Carver. Win this and I would think he could be put in charge until the end of the season.

Southampton get us underway at St James' Park.

We're a little over five minutes away from kick-off at St James' Park, which means Southampton's players have almost certainly whacked on these snazzy yellow kits by now.

Speaking ahead of kick-off at St James' Park, Saints boss Ronald Koeman said: 'We know they are strong, but it is tough to beat us.

'Winning games is the best medicine. We miss some good players but for others it's an opportunity.

'They need a win, the last few games they've had some defeats and they are at home.'
