Greenland's wilderness remains largely unexplored thanks to its rugged terrain.

Now, to help reach the country's remotes lakes and glaciers, scientists are using an unconventional mode of transport: a flying rubber dinghy.

The dinghy is attached to a light aircraft so it can take off on land and water, and it can carry two people up to altitudes of almost 10,000ft (3,000 metres).

The dinghy (pictured) is attached to a light aircraft so it can take off on land and water, and it can carry two people up to altitudes of almost 10,000ft (3,000 metres). It has a wingspan of 37ft (11.15 metres) and is powered by a two-stroke engine. The vehicle is being used by scientists to explore remote areas of Greenland

The vehicle, which can reach up to 50mph (80k/h) is being used by staff at the Centre of Geogenetics in Copenhagen, reports Polarfronten.   

It has a wingspan of 37ft (11.15 metres) and is powered by a twin cylinder, two-stroke engine fitted with a rear-facing propeller. 

The 551lb (250kg) vehicle carries up to 992lbs (450kg), including up to two people plus fuel.

The scientists explained that the craft is also cheap to fly and it has a range of 93 miles (150km) on a full tank of 35 litres. 

During expeditions, the aircraft has reached 50mph (80k/h) and the scientists explained it is cheap to fly. It has a range of 93 miles (150km) on a full tank of 35 litres but due to its lightweight nature it is susceptible to strong winds. On a recent expedition to Narsarsuaq (stock image) it keeled over and needed to be repaired

However, due to its lightweight nature it is susceptible to strong winds. 

Greenland was recently the 66th country to be added to Google's Street View mapping service. 

Highlights include the Illulissat icefjord, on the west coast of Greenland, and a statue of missionary Hans Egede in Nuuk. 

Google has also captured Brattahild - Erik the Red's estate in the Viking colony in south western Greenland. 

On a recent expedition to Narsarsuaq, for example, it was used to collect water samples from remote lakes, but keeled over and needed to be repaired. 

Google recently added Greenland to its Google's Street View mapping service to help armchair explorers visit the region. 

It became the 66th country added to the site.

Greenland was recently the 66th country to be added to Google's Street View mapping service and highlights include the Illulissat icefjord, on the west coast of Greenland. The Unesco World Heritage site is 155 miles (250km) north of the Arctic Circle and features the Sermeq Kujalleq (pictured)

Google has also captured Brattahlíð, known as Brattahild - Erik the Red's estate in the Viking colony he established in south western Greenland at the end of the 10th century. A reconstruction of a chapel, said to be the earliest church in the New World, stands near the original site (pictured) in the town of Qassiarsuk
