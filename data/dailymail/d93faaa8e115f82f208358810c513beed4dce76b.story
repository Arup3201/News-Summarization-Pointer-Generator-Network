A final thought on the toxic fall-out between Rio Ferdinand and John Terry. Might the Football Association have been able to broker a rapprochement? Here were two players who had stood side by side through countless internationals.

With Ferdinand now saying he sought a quick resolution, a simple apology, and did not consider Terry a racist, was there not more common ground than was previously assumed?

The police involvement was the prime complication, yet even this may not have been insurmountable. In a less complicated era, matters on the football field were invariably handled by the FA alone. The police did not want to be involved every time two players got into a fight, and the FA did not want confrontations to end up in court.

As long as the FA guaranteed stiff discipline and justice, the police were happy to keep their distance. It is the reason Paul Davis of Arsenal was not prosecuted for breaking Southampton midfielder Glenn Cockerill’s jaw in 1988.

Could the FA have told the police that they would deal with Terry? Did they even try? At the time, it more appeared that they backed off the moment the police were involved. Most likely the nature of the offence would have left them terrified; frightened to be thought complacent, or accused of going soft and ignoring racial sensitivities if they merely tried to bring the sides together.

Yet a less punitive, swifter and more positive resolution is what Ferdinand says he wanted. Why, three years on, is the wound still sore? Why, so long after, does it continue to feel like there could have been a better way?
