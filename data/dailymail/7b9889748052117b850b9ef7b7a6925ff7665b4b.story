At least four people have died and dozens more injured after freezing rain hit the Northeast on Sunday morning.

A pair of multi-car pileups - including one involving dozens of vehicles - in icy conditions on interstates in the Philadelphia area claimed at least three lives as authorities reported hundreds of crashes were reported across eastern Pennsylvania.

A crash involving an estimated 30 to 50 vehicles on Interstate 76 early on Sunday killed one person, state police said. The crash blamed on 'flash-freezing' prompted closure of the highway in both directions, although one lane was reopened in the afternoon.

Chaos: Ice caused more than 20 vehicles to come together on Interstate 76 west of Philadelphia, killing two people and injuring dozens 

Two other people were killed in a crash involving multiple vehicles on Interstate 476, police said.

Both interstates are busy arteries serving communities west of the city. Officials said Interstate 95, a north-south highway through the area, was also closed early Sunday but had since reopened.

In Connecticut, police cited slippery conditions in a crash that killed an 88-year-old woman who struck a utility pole in New Haven.

Pennsylvania Department of Transportation spokesman Eugene Blaum called travel conditions 'very hazardous' due to light rain falling onto cold surfaces, creating a sheet of ice.

'This is the worst type of winter precipitation to combat, because it can freeze instantly and it doesn't need to be the whole pavement for vehicles crossing it to have problems,' Blaum said.

PennDOT had nearly 150 trucks out treating roadways before daybreak, when it became clear that conditions would be slippery, Blaum said.

Response: Paramedics and firefighters are pictured at the scene of the mass collision which forced the road to close for hours, causing chaos for fellow motorists

Emergency dispatchers reported more than 80 calls for ice-related crashes in Northampton County, 100 in Lehigh County, 100 in Bucks County - some involving emergency vehicles -and more than 75 in Montgomery County.

Kaitlyn Maier, of Philadelphia, said she came upon the I-76 accident moments after it happened as she was driving with her boyfriend to her niece's baptism, which she missed.

'Ten minutes before I was asking him, what is this? Rain, or what?' said Maier, who said she was 10 to 15 cars behind the wreck and saw smoke pouring from one vehicle. The line of crashed cars extended around a bend in front of her.

Maier said emergency responders directed her and other drivers to turn around on the highway and drive eastbound on the westbound side to the next exit.

Within the next several minutes, Maier saw two cars collide and two other accidents that had just happened. They decided to stop at a diner to wait until the roads cleared.

'I've driven through snow a lot, and this isn't like anything I've ever driven in,' said Maier, who was raised in upstate New York. 'We were stopped for a while on the side of the road. I was going less than 10 mph, but I had no control of my vehicle.'

The Delaware River Port Authority closed bridges linking Philadelphia and New Jersey during the morning while workers put down salt, but began reopening lanes by midmorning.

The Pennsylvania Turnpike closed between Morgantown and the Delaware River Bridge but reopened at noon with speed limits reduced to 45 mph.

The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority canceled early bus service in Philadelphia but resumed service late in the morning.

Philadelphia International Airport reported some cancellations due to conditions.

Freezing rain and snow was expected in interior parts of New England, but the temperature was expected to rise into the 40s and 50s along the coast and change the precipitation to plain rain in time for the evening AFC Championship Game between the Patriots and Indianapolis Colts.

Scene: The huge crash in Oregon occurred shortly before 5 a.m. east of Baker City, about 130 miles northwest of Boise, Idaho. Debris was seen scattered over the road in the aftermath 

On the West Coast, high winds left tens of thousands of customers without power in the Seattle area, but power companies promised Seahawks fans they'd do their best to restore power before the NFC title game against the Green Bay Packers.

In eastern Oregon, highway officials partially reopened Interstate 84 Sunday after a massive crash blamed on black ice Saturday closed more than 160 miles of eastbound lanes. Rain was expected in western Oregon Sunday and Monday, but not as much as fell on Saturday, when 1.8 inches of rain in Portland sent some untreated sewage into the Willamette River.

Hove arrived on the scene to find 'a sheet of ice' on the roadway. Troopers are still investigating, but Hove said he believes it was a chain-reaction crash.

'A couple of the trucks came upon the black ice, and they jackknifed and crashed into each other. And it just continued to escalate,' Hove told The Associated Press by phone.

Authorities updated their report hours after the crash, increasing the number of vehicles directly involved from 20 to 26, and saying that the pileup left 50 to 70 vehicles stranded at the scene.

There were several separate collisions over a stretch of about three-quarters of a mile in the eastbound lanes, Hove said. He said many of the damaged vehicles were tractor-trailers, and several spilled their loads.

Two trucks were transporting hazardous materials. Their cargo did not spill, but crews had to clean up diesel from the trucks' fuel tanks.

'We understand it's frustrating when the freeway is closed like this,' said Tom Srandberg, a spokesman for the Oregon Department of Transportation. 'Our primary concern is safety, and (we) want to make sure everything is cleared by our hazmat folks before we let any traffic through the areas.'

Interstate 84 links Salt Lake City with Portland, Oregon, and is the primary east-west highway through eastern Oregon. The eastbound lanes were closed for several hours but officials said at least one lane was reopening Saturday night. Westbound lanes were closed temporarily near the crash site. 

Dozens of spinouts and accidents were reported from northern New Jersey to southern New Hampshire on Sunday and treacherous conditions forced the closure of the New York State Thruway from Newburgh to New York City during the morning. 

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority warned travelers on New York City's Metro-North commuter railroad to beware of ice on staircases, platforms and parking lots.
