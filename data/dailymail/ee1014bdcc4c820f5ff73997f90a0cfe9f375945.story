Barnet's summer signing Dan Bradley has left the club after revealing he can't afford to move closer to the area.

The 25-year-old signed for the Bees from Alfreton Town just two months ago, but after failing to feature in the club's two pre-season friendlies, Bradley has decided he will have to leave.

Bradley, who still lives in the Midlands, told the Non League Paper: 'I was under the impression I’d be allowed to stay down there two or three night a week in a B&B or one of their houses, and on my day off I could come home.

Gone: Barnet manager Martin Allen will have to start the new campaign without Bradley

'I’ve got commitments with my house so I couldn’t afford to just up sticks and leave.

'At this level you have got to make ends meet as well. To go and live in Barnet, I would have been broke. Having a house here as well as down there just wasn’t financially possible for me.'

Barnet manager Martin Allen will have to do without the midfielder, but insisted that the change was the best option got both parties.

Allen added: 'It is disappointing because he is a good player but it is probably best for us and best for him that we let him go.'
