According to Greek media, the identity of the businessman has not been disclosed.

The island, off the western coast of Greece, was bought by Onassis in 1962.

At the time is believed to have cost just 3.5 million drachmas, the equivalent of about £10,000.

Six years later it hosted his wedding to Jacqueline Kennedy, the widow of the late President John F Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1963.

After his death Skorpios passed to his daughter Christina, who died of a heart attack aged 37 in 1988, and then to Athina, the Daily Telegraph reports.

According to Greek press the contracts for the purchase of the private island are being drawn up by law firms in Athens and Geneva.

Farhad Vladi, whose company, Vladi Private Islands, has hundreds of islands on its books, told the paper that while he had not heard of the deal, it was possible Ms Onassis Roussel had decided to sell the island.

He said: 'These Russian oligarchs have billions, so it may be that one of them came along and said "I will give you 100 million or 200 million euros for it". Anything is possible.'

He was asked by Ms Onassis Roussel to carry out an evaluation of the island eight years ago.

It is believed she has little 
interest in spending time on the island, or in Greece.

He said the water comes from a mountain bought by Aristotle Onassis on a nearby island, and that anyone who bought the island would need to buy the mountain also, which he estimated would cost upwards of 100 million euros.

The island hosted many parties during the time of Aristotle Onassis, who is buried there, as is his daughter and his son, Alexander, who died in a plane crash in 1973.  

It is also home to three residences, a helicopter landing pad and a boat quay.

Swiss-educated Ms Onassis Roussel is the only surviving descendant of the shipping magnate.

Ms Onassis Roussel was born in France, and is the only child of Christina Onassis and her fourth husband, Thierry Roussel.

She is married to Brazilian Olympic show jumper, Alvaro de Miranda Neto, and lives in Sao Paulo.

In the past there have been rumours that Giorgio Armani, Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, and Madonna were interested in buying the tiny island.
