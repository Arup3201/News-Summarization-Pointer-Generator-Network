From a young Afghan girl clutching a skateboard to an excitable baby boy meeting a dog for the very first time, these incredible photographs - which each capture the exceptionally moving expressions on these children's faces - have been shortlisted for a prestigious award.

The four portraits have been nominated for the Taylor Wessing Portrait Prize 2014, which holds a reward of £12,000, having been selected from more than 4,000 submissions. 

Entries for the award came from both professional and amateur photographs but these were deemed the best of the bunch and will go on display at the National Portrait Gallery in London later in the year.

The finalists include freelance photographer Jessica Fulford-Dobson, who submitted a touching image of a seven-year-old girl holding a skateboard, and Birgit Püve’s picture of identical twin boys kneeling next to their great-grandmother’s hen in the Republic of Estonia.

The other finalists comprise of Blerim Racaj’s photograph of a group of young people from Kosovo enjoying a drink and photographer David Titlow’s incredible picture of his baby son being introduced to a dog for the very first time.

All four images will now be closely studied by a judging panel before the winner is announced on November 11.

'Braian and Ryan': Professional photographer Birgit Puve, lives and works in Tallinn, Estonia, has been shortlisted for this moving image of identical twin boys with a hen

'Konrad Lars Hastings Titlow': London-based photographer David Titlow took this incredibly heart-warming photo of his baby son meeting a dog for the first time

'Skate girl': Freelancer Jessica Fulford-Dobson said her image of an Afghan girl holding a skateboard was taken to show how it gives them some semblance of childhood

'Indecisive moment': Blerim Racaj, who grew up in Kosovo but now lives in London, said his image was taken as part of a project triggered by the socio-political landscape in Kosovo and high level of unemployment among the young population. All the photographs will go on display at the National Portrait Gallery in November
