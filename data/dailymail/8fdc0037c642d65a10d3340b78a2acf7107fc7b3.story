Gisele Bundchen poses in boxy blazers and smart menswear tailoring as the new face of French label Isabel Marant.

Ms Bundchen, 33, fronts the brand’s fall 2014 advertisements – taking over the helm from previous campaign girl Daria Werbowy.

This is not Ms Bundchen’s first time representing the label – she last starred in its spring 2011 campaign.

New gig: Gisele Bundchen has been named as the new face of Isabel Marant - fronting the label's fall 2014 ads

Perfect poster girl: Ms Bundchen's trademark hair and good looks make her a more than adequate match for Ms Marant's famously laid-back clothes

The mother of Benjamin, four, and Vivian, one, is seen in the label's newest clothes - like an intarsia sweater, and chic buckled boots.

Her appointment as the face of Isabel Marant – a label lauded for its unapologetically louche approach to classic French fare – comes just ahead of her starring moment expected at this summer’s World Cup.

On July 13, the stunner is reportedly slated to present the tournament’s winning team with its coveted trophy.

That is not the only exciting venture for Ms Bunchen, married to New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady since 2009.

Last
 week word of her topless campaign for Stuart Weitzman was released, 
showing the Brazilian beauty in tapered jeans, boots, and little else.

In living color: Ms Bundchen has a lot to celebrate this summer - as she was just named the face of Chanel No 5 and is expected to present the world cup trophy in July

In late May, she was named as the new face of Chanel No. 5 – taking over the iconic fragrance campaign from archival footage of Marilyn Monroe.

Ms Bundchen is no stranger to Chanel and is currently the face of the brand's Les Beiges make-up range.

Her No 5 campaign is expected to launch at the end of this year.
