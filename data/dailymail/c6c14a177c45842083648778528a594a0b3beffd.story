In matters of the heart, it appears Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's ruthless streak got the better of his chivalrous side

He is viewed as Hitler’s finest general, respected even by the Allies as a professional and honourable soldier.

But Erwin Rommel was also capable of great cunning, as his opponents learned when they were outmanoeuvred on the battlefields of North Africa.

In matters of the heart, it appears that this ruthless streak got the better of his chivalrous side. 

In fact, his grandson says the man nicknamed the Desert Fox was a love rat.

Josef Pan, 72, is to publish the story of his grandmother Walburga’s love affair with Rommel – an affair which he says Rommel covered up for the sake of his career.

Mr Pan, from Bavaria, owns the 150 letters Rommel sent to Walburga, who committed suicide 15 years after she bore his child.

He also has a photo of the couple shortly before the First World War.

‘Walburga gave birth to my mother Gertrud Stemmer, on December 8, 1913, but he turned away from her and married Lucie Mollin in 1916,’ said Mr Pan.

‘My grandmother died in 1928, a few months before Rommel had his son, Manfred, with Lucie.’

Rommel had delighted in the birth of Gertrud and wrote to her calling her his ‘little mouse’.

He once said he would like to set up home with Walburga and Gertrud. ‘It’s got to be perfect, this little nest of ours,’ he said.

However, he returned to Lucie, with whom he had had an  affair, and married her in 1916. 

Walburga never recovered from  her rejection.

Mr Pan said: ‘Rommel was Walburga’s only love. As long as Rommel and Lucie never had children, she held on to the conviction that he would return to her.’

When Walburga knew Lucie was pregnant, she took an overdose, said Mr Pan. Above, Rommel (seen here in the African desert) in France in 1944

But when she knew Lucie was pregnant she took an overdose, said Mr Pan, adding: ‘The explanation given was that she had died of pneumonia.

'Later the family doctor told my mother she had taken her own life.’

'Rommel was Walburga's only love. As long as Rommel and Lucie (above) never had children, she held on to the conviction that he would return to her,' said Mr Pan

Gertrud exchanged hundreds of letters with her father and his wife knew about her.

She even knitted him a scarf, which he wore frequently at the battlefront.

Rommel, a decorated officer in the First World War, distinguished himself during the invasion of France in 1940 and later in North Africa where he earned his reputation as a skilful but honourable general prior to his defeat at El Alamein by Britain’s Eighth Army – the Desert Rats.

Despite failure in Africa, Rommel was
still immensely popular in Germany. In 1943, Hitler gave him command 
over the sea defences of occupied France.

In June 4, 1944, he left for Germany to celebrate Lucie’s 50th birthday.

On the same day, the Allied invasion of France began.

Once again, Rommel had to rush back to the battlefield. Wounded in an air attack on his car, he returned home to convalesce.

Gertrud
stayed close to the family, even after her father was forced to commit 
suicide in 1944 after he was implicated in the plot by senior army 
officers to kill Hitler.

He took his own life after being assured by the Nazis that if he did so his family would be unharmed.
