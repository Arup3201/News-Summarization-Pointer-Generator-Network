While her sister, the Duchess of Cambridge, has dominated the headlines over the last month thanks to her stellar sense of style, Pippa Middleton has been keeping a relatively low profile.

But when she stepped out in Fulham this morning, she ensured all eyes were on her courtesy of a glamorous ensemble that included a £750 Aspinal of London Marylebone leather tote, a chic cream silk shirt and a natty pair of £159 Edie smoking slippers created by up-and-coming designer, Jemima Vine.

She completed the look with a pair of £125 tortoiseshell Saratoga sunglasses by hip new eyewear brand Taylor Morris, which was launched last year by Made In Chelsea's Hugo Taylor and best friend, Charlie Morris.

Fitness fanatic Pippa was leaving the gym where she had enjoyed a two-hour session on the treadmill before heading off to work at her parents' company, Party Pieces, where she has a part time role editing in-house magazine, Party Times.

Although she continues to contribute to US title Vanity Fair and has a regular column in the Telegraph, much of her attention has, of late, focused on her banker boyfriend Nico Jackson to whom she is rumoured to be engaged.

Most recently, the romantic pair were spotted enjoying themselves at the Scottish wedding of two of Pippa's oldest friends, Julian Osborne and Rowena Mcrae, where they were joined by Carole and Michael Middleton.

Pippa, 30, who arrived at the wedding wearing a cat dress by Suzannah and with a bag by Emmy London, met Rowena on a course at the prestigious £3,600-a-month cookery school.

Sharp: Although Pippa still works for Party Pieces, of late, much of her attention has been on her love life

The future writer spent some time at the culinary institution at The Grange, in Frome, Somerset during her gap-year and has remained close to Rowena and her now husband ever since.

Pippa has been with Nico, 36, for 18 months and their increasing number of cosy public appearances are fuelling suspicions that they could be ready to get married themselves.

Just over a month ago, the couple were spotted enjoying the sunshine on the slopes with Nico’s grandparents at luxury ski resort Lech in the Austrian Alps.

The destination is so glamorous that even the ski-lifts are sponsored by luxury brands such as Dior and Chanel.

Pippa met Nico, originally from Folkestone in Kent and who made his millions at Deutsche Bank, on a previous skiing trip.
