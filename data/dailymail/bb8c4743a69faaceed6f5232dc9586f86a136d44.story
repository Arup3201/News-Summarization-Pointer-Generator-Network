Caught: James Robert Jones has been arrested after being on the run since 1977

A soldier who escaped from an Army's maximum security prison in 1977 has been caught in Florida nearly four decades later.

James Robert Jones had been serving a 23-year sentence for murdering a fellow soldier in 1974, when he escaped from the military prison known as the Castle, in Kansas.

But facial recognition software led to his downfall when investigators matched his photo to the driver's license he had under his new name.

Jones was arrested as he made his way to work in Pompano Beach yesterday morning, and is awaiting extradition to Kansas.

When police arrested him, Jones told them: 'I knew it would catch up to me one day'.

The 59-year-old had taken on an assumed name of Bruce Walter Keith and changed his birth date to create a new identity that he shielded from everyone, including his wife, named by NBC Miami as Mary.

Jones had been on the Army's 15 Most Wanted list since 1977, when he escaped from prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

He was serving a 23-year sentence for premeditated murder and aggravated assault after killing a fellow soldier in New Jersey, when he was a private.

Officials say he managed to get a fraudulent driver's license for Florida in 1981, using the name of his friend, Bruce Walter Keith, and the day and month of his mother's birthday coupled with the year he was born.

A spokesman for Fort Leavenworth told Mail Online Jones, who was 23 when he escaped on March 21, 1977, was last been seen working in the prison dining hall.

Arrest: Jones was stopped by police when he arrived for work at this building on Thursday. He was one year away from retirement

Jones
 was one of 11 inmates who fled during seven escape attempts between 
1977 and 1978. He was the only one to evade capture for so long.

The prison has 
since moved to a new building, and the section known as the Castle, where Jones was held, was demolished.

The
 Army contacted U.S. Marshals about two months ago for help in catching 
Jones, after receiving information that he was believed to be living in 
Florida.

Facial recognition software was used to match an old prison photo to his driver's license image.

'That database hits on a number of key points on your face and it gives a number of potential matches,' Barry Golden, of the Marshals Service, said.

In Jones' case however, 'It came out with one potential positive match,' he said.

A finger print taken at the police station confirmed Jones' true identity and he admitted it too, according to the Chicago Tribune.

Alias: Jones had created a new identity and life for himself and was living in this Florida home

Jones had been just one year from taking early retirement, he told officers.

'Capturing a cold case fugitive who has 
been on the run for almost 37 years is a great arrest for law 
enforcement, but it also is comforting to the families of the original 
victim to know the person who escaped from custody is now behind bars 
again,' William Snelson, of the Marshals Service Investigative Operations Division, said.

If Jones had served his full original sentence he would have been released 17 years ago.

At a brief court hearing on Friday, the judge ordered that he be held without bond, and noted that Jones had been flagged as having 'violent tendencies'.

Jones has been charged with homicide, military desertion and escape.
