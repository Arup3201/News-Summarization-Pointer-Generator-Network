A father of three died in an avalanche on the last day of a family skiing holiday in the Italian Alps near to the French border.

Graeme Porteous, 48, was swept to his death on Saturday after his off-piste ski party was hit by a 45ft-wide wall of snow in Argentera in Piedmont.

Mr Porteous, who lived in Wimbledon, South-West London, with his wife Alexandra, survived the initial impact of the avalanche but suffered ‘multiple trauma’ when he was trapped against a tree and died within minutes.

Last night a neighbour confirmed that Singapore-born Mr Porteous was a private investment banker who ran his own business from the £5.8million family home.

The neighbour said: ‘This is a tragic accident for a lovely family.’

Mr Porteous is one of three skiers killed this weekend across Italy by heavy snow falls.

Italian authorities said that he was part of a ‘really well organised’ group of ten friends and two guides enjoying the final day of their holiday but that conditions in that area were perilous.

Raffaele Bagnis, head of the local Alpine Rescue team, told The Times: ‘They had gone off piste and provoked the avalanche.

‘There was one metre of fresh snow there and two metres higher up, with massive drifts built up by the wind

‘There was too much snow to be out there. You can be the best skier in the world, but that doesn’t count in conditions like that.

‘Mr Porteous was conscious after the impact, but complained of pain in his leg and died five minutes later.’

The group had taken good precautions against the weather and each skier was wearing a backpack containing twin airbags, which can be inflated when an avalanche approaches to help stop the wearer being buried by snow.

None was buried and all excepted for Mr Porteous escaped unharmed.

Captain Giuseppe La Torre, the local commander of the Carabiniere police said the spate of avalanches across the region have been caused by unseasonably warm weather.

He said: ‘There are lots of avalanches here at the moment because of snowfalls followed by sun. It can be very dangerous and this was indicated to skiers.’

Mr Porteous’s group, which is believed to include his wife, returned to the UK yesterday and were said to be ‘destroyed’ at his death.

There were numerous other incidents in the region over the weekend.

At Cortina d’Ampezzo in the Veneto region, rescuers spent four hours recovering the body of a 24 year old Dutch skier buried by a an avalanche while skiing off piste.

And i the Trentino region, a group of snowboarders headed off piste at Passo Brocon but were struck by an avalanche which killed one of them after he was buried under nearly five feet of snow.
