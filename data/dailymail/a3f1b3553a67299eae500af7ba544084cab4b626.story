An ecstatic Texans fan's birthday visit to Florida to see her team play the Jaguar's turned to a nightmare when a mean-spirited online troll canceled her ticket.

Last weekend, Alice Rodriguez's boyfriend Carlos bought her a surprise flight to Jacksonville to watch her team play.

The superfan was so excited that she posted a picture of her boarding passes to the Traveling Texans Facebook fanpage, only to be stunned to receive an email from the airline shortly afterwards confirming her flight was canceled.

Sideline: Alice and Carlos were gifted passes to the field by the Jaguars after their story went viral online

'I mean what could happen with just a picture of her boarding pass?' said Carlos to KHOU.com.

Unfortunately, an individual with the Twitter name of 'Duval Undertaker' looked at the boarding pass, saw the confirmation number and proceeded to phone the airline.

He bragged about his cruel prank online, but Alice and Carlos had the last laugh when the airline decided to reissue the tickets after they believed the couple.

However, what happened next stunned the couple after they landed in Florida and realized their troubles had gone viral online.

Mean: This is the message from Duval Undertaker - who has now deleted his online profiles - boasting he had deleted Alice and Carlos' tickets to Florida

'I had text messages, I had several Facebook messages. A lot of the Facebook messages were from Jaguars!' said Alice.

At the stadium rival fans began offering them drinks and food and asking them to join their tailgating parties.

'We got there and it was, like, unbelievable because everybody knew us! It was like, 'you are those Texan fans!' said Alice to KHOU.com.

They were even gifted sideline passes to the game by the Jaguars. 

Thanks: Carlos and Alice were greeted with hospitality by the Jaguars and joined in opposition fans tailgate

And the last laugh was definitely their as it was revealed the prankster has tried to delete all his presence online.

Alice also revealed that she is considering contacting the police to press fraud charges.

We've heard stories about other things that he's done," Alice explained. "And it's like, who does that?"
