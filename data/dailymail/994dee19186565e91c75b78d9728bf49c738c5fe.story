A Lebanese-made supercar will become the most expensive motor in the world when it is unveiled later this year - setting buyers back £2.2 million.

But even those with the highest budgets to appease their boy racer fantasies might need to scramble for the new LykanHypersport - as only seven of the cars are being created this year.

The car becomes the world's most expensive above the Bugatti Veyron, which costs a mere £1.5 million.

Despite its huge cost, the car, which is to be unveiled at the Qatar motor show, is not as fast as the Veyron.

While the LykanHypersport does 0-60mph in 2.7 seconds, the Veyron does it in 2.5 seconds.

The cheaper rival also has a greater top speed of 267mph.

But for those potential buyers not all that bothered about driving the car at racing track speed, they can sit back and enjoy the car's leather interior that is stitched with gold.

The luxury car even has diamond-encrusted lights.

Created by firm W Motors, the motor has an impressive 750 horsepower engine.

Tech-heads will also be impressed by the vehicle's 3D holographic display and its interactive dashboard.

The car, first imagined by designer Ralph Debbas, who previously worked with Aston Martin, has taken six years to design.

It was developed in alongside Magna Steyr Italia, RUF Automobile, Studiotorino, Viotti, and ID4MOTIO.
