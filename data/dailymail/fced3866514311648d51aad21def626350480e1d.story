Josh Wakeham, aged just 22 months, was killed in a freak accident when the cord from his bedroom window blind became wrapped around his neck

A coroner today warned parents of the dangers of ordinary hazards in the home after a tragic toddler was strangled by the cord on a window blind in his bedroom.

Little Joshua Wakeham, who would have had his second birthday tomorrow, died in the freak accident on January 24, this year, as he looked out of the window.

He was found dead by his mother with the blind cord wrapped around his neck when she went to check on him.

The inquest heard ‘active and inquisitive’ Josh was the third child in Britain this year to die after becoming entangled in a roller blind cord.

Coroner David Bowen said: ‘It is not reasonable for any parent to monitor their children 24 hours a day, but I hope this tragedy will serve as a warning to all parents.

‘Potential hazards should be put out of reach of children.’

The inquest heard little Josh, then aged 22 months, loved to stand on his bed to wave at passers-by out of his bedroom on the top-floor of his family’s three-storey home.

His mother Tracey Ford, 34, said: ‘There was a blackout blind on the window which was there when we moved in.

'He loved to wave to people and I never saw him play with the string on the blind.

‘I put him to bed that night with his toys and turned on the nightlight to let him settle.’

Tracey, who was described a very caring mother, went to check shortly after 9pm - but immediately realised something was wrong.

She said: ‘I could see he was stood up and it looked like he was looking out of the window. I then saw that the cord was around his neck. When I touched him he felt cold.

Warning: Josh's mother Tracey Ford with her partner and Josh's stepfather Tim Llewellin are warning other parents of the dangers of looped cords on window blinds

‘I dialled 999 and they gave me instructions to give him mouth-to-mouth. I tried, I really tried. But he was cold.’

Det Sgt Wendy Keeping told the inquest: ‘This is the third death this year in the UK involving young children with roller blinds. Joshua was nearly two and he would not have known of the dangers at all.

‘He became trapped in it and was not old enough to recognise the danger.’

The family’s MP Paul Flynn has 
made an early day motion in the House of Commons to call on the blind 
manufacturers to bring in safety features.

He is also calling for a Government
initiative to publicise the serious danger to the lives of children 
from the 250million cords in British homes.

Mr Flynn said: ‘The case is heart breaking. The industry should bring out safer cords.

‘There’s new regulations coming in from Europe within a year but there will still be a problem with existing cords.

‘We are asking the government to start a campaign to make sure everyone knows of the dangers.'

A post mortem examination found that the youngster had died as a result of strangulation from the cord.

Josh’s parents Tracey and Tim have moved out of the house in Newport, South Wales, since the tragedy.

Gwent coroner Mr Bowen recorded a verdict of accidental death.

He said: ‘Joshua was normal, active, healthy, inquisitive child who liked nothing better than standing at his bedroom window waving at members of the public as they walked past.

‘He would stand in the window whether it was day or night. He became entangled in the cord and would not have recognised the danger - he was much too young to release himself.’

He concluded: ‘I am satisfied that while standing at the window Joshua somehow became entangled.

‘He would never have recognised the danger that the cord posed.

'He would have been much too young and would also have been much too weak to release himself.

‘The verdict in this tragic case, therefore, is accidental death.’

The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents are campaigning to raise awareness.

Spokesman Michael Corley said: ‘There have been 22 deaths caused by blind cords since 1999.

‘Eleven of these have happened since the beginning of 2010. This is far too high. We are calling for laws to reduce the risks of looped cords by placing safety devices in them or by getting rid of them altogether.’

In October, 2011, the parents of Emily Warner told how their family had been left 'broken' by her death

In October, 2010, 18-month-old Rithik Chakrabarti died in his bedroom in Dorset. And in 2009 Gethin Jones, 23 months, was found strangled at his home in Nefyn, North Wales.

In October, 2011, the parents of Emily Warner told how their family had been left 'broken' by her death.

The little girl had been put to bed but stood up on the end of her bed-frame and was climbing across her window sill when the accident happened last August.

The two-year-old was left paralysed and suffered brain damage, and died months later.

Caden Laine, who was 21 months old, died after apparently being strangled by a looped cord from his bedroom window at the family home in Plymouth, Devon.

His devastated parents, Tony and Danielle Laine, said that the tragic accident had taken the life of their 'little angel' and warned other parents to check their children's bedrooms in a bid to prevent similar deaths.

Caden had an identical twin, Finley, and two-year-old brother Blake.

Harrison Joyce, three, from Staffordshire, also died after becoming tangled in a cord in February 2010

Mrs Laine told how she left the twins' bedroom for just minutes to make some milk, before she returned and found her son hanged on the cord of the vertical blinds.

They believe Caden climbed on to a chest of drawers near the window before the tragic event around 7.15pm, in April, last year.

Harrison Joyce, three, and Lillian Bagnall-Lambe, 16 months, both from Staffordshire, died in separate incidents within the space of five days after becoming tangled in the cords in February, 2010.

Harrison was believed to have been acting out action moves from cartoon series 'Go Diego' when he became tangled in the cord and was killed. He had been left alone for a matter of minutes.

Blinds with looped cords are already banned in other countries, including America, Canada and Australia, but millions of people in Britain have them fitted in their homes.

Andrew Haigh, coroner for South Staffordshire, recorded accidental death verdicts in respect of the two children's deaths.

But he urged the Government to look again at existing safety regulations and said he would be writing to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to highlight the problem.

Leah Edwards was sleeping beside her 17-month-old brother at the family home in Maldon, Essex, when the tragedy happened in October 2010. She became entangled in a blind cord.

The youngster was discovered by her seven-year-old brother, Christian.
