Crystal palace have been offered Togo forward Serge Gakpe from Nantes. 

The 27-year-old is out of contract in the summer and Nantes are looking to generate bids now. 

The player has a three year contract offer from Torino for the summer. French-born Gakpe can play as a secondary striker or on either wing.

Palace hope to wrap up the signing of Lille left back Pape Souare after Senegal's game with Algeria in Guinea. 

Senegal crashed out of the Africa Cup of Nations on Tuesday after losing 2-0 to Algeria, so a deal can now be finalised.

Alan Pardew is evidently in the market for strikers, having already brought in Yaya Sanogo on loan from Arsenal, and is also keen to team up again with former Newcastle forward Shola Ameobi.

The Eagles are close to securing a deal for Lille left-back Pape Souare, who is currently at AFCON 2015
