Killed: In May, when soldier Lee Rigby (pictured) was killed in Woolwich, south east London, police in London recorded 104 anti-Muslim hate crimes

Hate crimes against Muslims have soared this year, new figures have shown.

Hundreds of anti-Muslim offences have been carried out across the country in 2013, with Britain’s biggest force, the Metropolitan police, recording 500 Islamophobic crimes alone.

Many forces reported a surge in the number of anti-Muslim hate crimes following the murder of soldier Lee Rigby by two Islamic extremists in Woolwich, south-east London.

And it is feared the figures could be much higher after nearly half of the 43 forces in England and Wales did not reveal how many hate crimes had targeted Muslims - with some forces admitting they do not always record the faith of a religious hate crime victim.

Freedom of Information requests were sent by the Press Association to every police force in England and Wales.

Of the 43 forces, 24 provided figures on the number of anti-Muslim crimes and incidents recorded.

Tell Mama, a group which monitors anti-Muslim incidents, said it had dealt with some 840 cases since April - with the number expected to rise to more than 1,000 by the end of March.

This compared with 582 anti-Muslim cases it dealt with from March 2012 to March 2013.

Fiyaz Mujhal, director of Faith Matters, which runs the Tell Mama project, said reaction to the murder of Fusilier Rigby had caused the number of Islamophobic crimes to 'significantly jump'.

'The far right groups, particularly the EDL (English Defence League) perniciously use the internet and social media to promote vast amounts of online hate,' he said.

Hate: Ukranian born Pavlo Lapshyn murdered of Mohammed Saleem, 82, who he stabbed as
 he walked home from prayers, He also planted a series of bombs 
outside mosques

Mr Mujhal said tougher sentencing was needed to tackle Islamophobic crime and branded guidelines by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to monitor social media as 'not fit for purpose'.

He said: 'They raised the bar of prosecution significantly. Now unless there is a direct threat to somebody on Twitter or Facebook, the CPS will not prosecute. The CPS is just plainly out of sync with reality.

'We also need more robust sentencing.
 In one case, a pig’s head was left outside a mosque and the perpetrator
 came away with a community sentence.

Metropolitan Police, recorded 500 
Islamophobic offences from January to mid-November this year, compared 
with 336 offences in 2012 and 318 in 2011.

Greater Manchester Police (GMP) recorded
 nearly double the number of Islamophobic crimes this year - with 130 
offences in 2013 compared with 75 in 2012.

The number of Islamophobic offences recorded by Kent police more than trebled this year - from 17 in 2012 to 54 in 2013.

Leicestershire Police recorded 31
 anti-Muslim crimes from January to mid-November this year, compared 
with 26 anti-Muslim crimes in both 2012 and 2011.

Thames Valley Police recorded 39 anti-Muslim crimes to mid-November this year, compared with 20 in 2012 and 31 in 2011.

West Mercia Police said 393 race or 
faith-related hates crimes were recorded in 2013 which included 25 that 
referred to the victim being Muslim.

Cheshire Police said they had recorded 
seven anti-Muslim hates crimes in 2013 - between April and October - 
compared with two in 2012 and one in 2011.

Cleveland Police said they were unable 
to provide figures for anti-Muslim hate crimes because the information 
“is not generally recorded”, as the force records ethnicity not 
religion.

Merseyside Police recorded 10 anti-Muslim hate crimes in 2013, compared with six in 2012 and eight in 2011.

West Yorkshire Police have recorded 37 anti-Muslim crimes in 2013 to November, compared with 24 in 2012, and 17 in 2011.

Humberside Police recorded 15 anti-Muslim hates this 
year compared with four in 2012 and two in 2011.

Warwickshire
 Police recorded two anti-Muslim hate crimes in 2013, while City of 
London Police recorded three Islamaphobic offences.

Nottinghamshire Police saw the number of anti-Muslim hate crimes double this year, from five in 2012 to 10 in 2013.

'When you target a mosque, you are targeting the whole community.'

Tell
 Mama has called for police forces to introduce a system which improves 
monitoring of Islamophobic crimes, after some forces admitted officers 
do not always record the faith of a religious hate crime victim.

'There are three problems we come across,' Mr Mujhal said.

'Firstly, there is a lack of understanding of the language of Islamophobia thrown at victims in any incidents.

'Secondly, there is very little training on how to ask relevant questions to pull out anti-Muslim cases.

'Thirdly, recording processes are not in line with each other. One force will allow an officer to flag an incident as anti-Muslim, another force will flag it as religious hate crime. There is no uniformity.

'There must be guidelines for all forces so we can know the level of the problem.'

Just five days after arriving in the country, Pavlo Lapshyn, 25, killed 82-year-old Muslim pensioner Mohammed Saleem because he hated 'non-whites' and wanted to start a race war.

The PhD student also ordered bomb-making materials online as he plotted mass murder in a series of mosque attacks.

Lapshyn told police that he had wanted to stab him in the heart and while he was at large for the killing, he planted three bombs near mosques in Walsall, Wolverhampton and Tipton in the West Midlands. He was jailed for 40 years.

The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) has previously said 71 incidents were reported to its national community tension team (NCTT) over five days after Fusilier Rigby was murdered on May 22.

Superintendent Paul Giannasi, Acpo’s spokesman on hate crime, said: 'We would obviously want overall crime levels to reduce and to see fewer victims, but we welcome increases in reported hate crime, as long as they are a sign of increased confidence of victims to report.

'We are working with local police forces, to help improve the way we respond to hate crime and to provide robust and transparent hate crime data.'

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'These are despicable crimes that devastate lives and communities.

'The courts already hand out tougher punishments where race or religion are found to be aggravating factors.

'The number of people receiving a custodial sentence for these appalling crimes is higher than ever before.'

A CPS spokeswoman said: 'Online communication can be offensive, shocking or in bad taste.

'However, as set out in CPS guidelines on prosecuting cases involving communications sent via social media, content has to be more than simply offensive to be contrary to the criminal law.

'In order to preserve the right to free speech the threshold for prosecution must be high and only communications that are grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or false are prohibited by the legislation.'
