A four-year-old boy has been filmed showing off his impressive snowboarding skills in the French Alps.

Pint-sized boarder Garrik Arutyunov has been hitting the slopes for as long as he has been able to walk, first taking up the sport in his home town of Wenduine in Belgium.

Encouraged by his Russian-born father Armen, who is himself an excellent snowboarder, Garrik now has the confidence to attempt jumps and tricks that even adult boarders would think twice about.

Tricks: Pint-sized snowboarder Garrik Arutyunov has been hitting the slopes for as long as he has been able to walk. This weekend he was filmed snowboarding in the Alpine resort of Avoriaz

Joy: Garrik clearly loves snowboarding - giving his proud father high-fives whenever he performs a trick

Patience: Garrik began by learning the basics - standing on a board and building momentum. He later progressed to mastering speed control and the ability to make tight turns

The video footage shows Garrik snowboarding in the Alpine resort of Avoriaz on Sunday.

Dressed in a ice blue helmet, with matching sunglasses and a lime green jacket, Garrik is seen racing down mountains, using rails to perform tricks, and even attempting jumps.

Although Garrik isn't able to land every move he makes, it is not difficult to see he has the kind of raw talent that could easily turn him into a professional snowboarder one day.

He doesn't even appear phased by the adults whizzing around him on the slopes, with one skier seeming to come perilously close to landing on Garrik after he takes a tumble on one of the ramps.

Family: Garrik's Russian-born father Armen Arutyunov (right) is seen throughout the video. He is also a keen and talented snowboarder, as is his mother Isabelle Verbeken

Armen Arutyunov - who moved to Belgium from Russia 10 years ago - was amazed to see how quickly his son took to the sport.

Acquiring his first snowboard shortly after learning to walk, Garrik began by learning the basics - standing on a board and building momentum - before mastering speed control and the ability to turn.

Within a year his snowboarding ability was such that he felt confident enough to start learning tricks - experimenting with small ramps and rails.

No fear: Encouraged by his father Garrik now has the confidence to attempt the kind of jumps and tricks that even adult boarders would think twice about

Confidence: Garrik doesn't even appear phased by the adults whizzing around him on the slopes

As can be seen in the video, Garrik clearly loves snowboarding - giving his proud father hugs and high-fives whenever he's able to pull off a trick.

It's not just the act of snowboarding that's keeping Garrik entertained, however.

Throughout the video he can be seen laughing as he throws snowballs at his family and friends.
