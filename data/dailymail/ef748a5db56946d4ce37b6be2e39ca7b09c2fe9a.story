Former Chelsea midfielder Florent Malouda has has signed for French Ligue 1 side Metz on a one-year deal.

The 34-year-old has been without a club since leaving Turkish side Tranbszonspor at the end of last season, and returns to his native France for the first time since he left Lyon for Stamford Bridge in 2007.

Malouda had been linked with a move to a host of Championship clubs, including Birmingham, but dismissed any possible move out of hand via his official Twitter account.

 'Just saw another story linking me with a championship club. I don't know any Lee Clark. Must be ice bucket challenge collateral damage,' he wrote on Tuesday.

Malouda then tweeted the next day: 'So Now they pretend to talk with my agent... I wish one day they introduce me to that mysterious agent... I simply don't have any #ownboss.'

It has since transpired, however, that Malouda's agent didn't actually contact the player to tell him of Birmingham's interest, which led to Blues boss Lee Clark responding with ire to the tweets of the winger.

'A member of my staff (head of recruitment) Malcolm Crosby, was contacted by the player’s agent,' Clark told the Birmingham Mail. 'We were asked if we were interested.

'Never once has it been said by myself, suggested or written that I spoke to the player. You don’t do that until you know you have common ground in terms of the wages.

'So why there has been this reaction, I don’t know. There should be no issue in what myself and the club were trying to do here, and that was sign a player we believed could have helped us.'

Malouda previously played for Chelsea for six seasons between 2007-13, winning the Premier League once, the FA Cup three times and coming off the bench as they beat Bayern Munich in the 2012 Champions League Final. 

He also played 80 times for France between 2004-12, scoring nine goals and starting their World Cup Final defeat to Italy in 2006.
