Men from the land Down Under are in fact the sexiest of them all, according to a travel dating website.

Aussie blokes took out the top spot in an annual list relased by Miss Travel, however our women didn't fare quite as well.

The ladies came in at seventh, with Brazilian women sizzling in first position as the sexiest females.

It's official: Our beloved blokes have been named sexiest in the world. Liam Hemsworth (left) and Zac Stenmark (right) are just some of our national treasures

Even though we didn't get a look in last year, Australian men have taken out the top spot for 2014

With famous faces like Hugh Jackman, Liam Hemsworth, the Stenmark twins, and an array of fit football players under our belt, its understable how our boys topped the charts this year.

However Australia didn't even get a look in last year, with neither our blokes nor dames appearing anywhere in the top ten.

The exotic dating website, which aims to pair wealthy but lonely men with attractive women looking for a free travel adventure, handed the hottest title to British men and Colombian women in 2013.

Brazilian women took out the title of the hottest females, maybe in part thanks to women like Alessandra Ambrosio, pictured here in a swimwear launch for Victoria's Secret

Adriana Lima, pictured here at the Victoria's Secret fashion show also flaunts what landed Brazilian women in the top spot

Our girls didn't fare quite as well, but still made the top ten coming in at seventh, pictured are models Miranda Kerr (left) and Jennifer Hawkins (right)

Italian, British, Scottish and Spanish men all took a place in the top five this year, with American, Irish, Brazilian, Canadian and Dutch males rounding out the top ten.

As for the women, Russian, Columbian, British and Filipina females all did their nations proud this year.

Spanish, Bulgarian, South African and Canadian ladies also made an entrance in the list, which is based on a survey of the dating website's members.
