Darren Clews took no action when staff told him they were worried Daniel Pelka had been beaten by his mother

The headteacher who failed to act on worries about Daniel Pelka said it had ‘not been a pleasant time for anyone concerned’.

Darren Clews, who at 34 is one of the youngest heads in the country, took no action when staff told him they were worried that the four-year-old had been beaten by his mother.

But he quietly left the primary school soon after the four-year-old was murdered and has now taken up a new headship.

Yesterday, pressure on the professionals involved in the case intensified after it was revealed that not one person has been disciplined.

Deputy PM Nick Clegg questioned how authorities had missed warning signs and said he thought Daniel’s death ‘should be on all of our consciences’.

The little boy resembled a ‘concentration camp victim’ following the cruelty inflicted on him by Magdalena Luczak, 27, and stepfather Mariusz Krezolek, 34.

Staff at Little Heath primary school, Coventry, noticed Daniel was stealing food, attempting to eat playdough and scavenging in playground bins. At one point, he was so ravenous he ate a pancake covered in mud and grit left after a Shrove Tuesday race.

By the time he died, his emaciated body weighed less than a toddler and he was six inches shorter than average. Teachers claimed they were hoodwinked by his ‘evil’ mother who told them he had an eating disorder.

But it was clear there was some distrust of Luczak. In January, Daniel’s class teacher Lisa Godfrey wrote in a school concerns book that he had bruises around his neck which she feared Luczak had caused while trying to ‘strangle him’.

The following month, she alerted Mr Clews when Daniel had black eyes. But, in court, Mr Clews claimed it was not serious enough to go in the concerns book.

It is believed that child protection officials were not made aware of Daniel’s desperate attempts to steal food, his rapid weight loss or his injuries. Parents told the Mail that at least three members of staff, including the headteacher, had left as a result of the tragedy.

One parent, whose child was in the same class as Daniel said: ‘The headteacher felt incredibly guilty that the school didn’t spot anything. I’d seen Daniel myself in class and he seemed perfectly happy. I certainly didn’t see any cause for concern.

‘The head left at the end of term after Daniel died. He sent a letter to all the parents that he was leaving due to the circumstances.

‘Daniel’s class teacher left soon after he died too, I don’t think she wanted to carry on working in the same school where she would be reminded of what happened.’

Yesterday, Mr Clews was enjoying the sunshine at his home in Wellesbourne, Warwickshire.

He refused to comment on the case, but added: ‘An awful lot has been said. It’s not been a pleasant time for anyone concerned, in all honesty.’ Mr Clews went straight from his old job to being appointed head of nearby Grangehurst primary school. Mr Clegg said: ‘Clearly people must have seen something was wrong with this boy. I think his death should be on all of our consciences. We all ask the same questions: how did this happen? What happened when teachers saw this boy scavenging in bins, when they saw him lose all that weight?

‘They apparently did pass information on – why did no-one act on it? When he went to hospital and the mum and stepfather spun a web of lies, what happened to the concerns people had?’

A Coventry city council spokesman said Mr Clews had left of his own volition and not as a result of Daniel’s death.
