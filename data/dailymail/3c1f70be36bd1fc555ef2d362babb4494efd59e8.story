The wife of the Sydney siege gunman has arrived in court as authorities push for her to be placed behind bars over alleged murder charges.

Wearing a tan trench-coat and white beanie, Amirah Droudis, 35, refused to condemn her husband's crimes when given the opportunity by the media outside Downing Centre Local Court. 'Leave us alone!' her brother John Aspros said.

Droudis was granted bail by a local court after she was charged with the murder of gunman Man Haron Monis's estranged wife Noleen Hayson Pal in 2013. Pal was found dead in a western Sydney stairwell, having been stabbed eighteen times and set alight.

Amirah Droudis, 35, arrived at Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney on Monday morning 

After it was revealed Monis was on bail when he took 18 people hostage at the Lindt cafe in Martin Place last Monday, NSW Attorney General Brad Hazzard demanded a review into Droudis bail decision. The matter will be heard by the Chief Magistrate, Judge Graeme Henson.

Hostages Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson, and the gunman died when police stormed the cafe more than 16 hours after the siege began. 

An autopsy of Monis's body has now been completed and a burial order will be made on Monday, which means the body will be released to next of kin to organise burial.

Monis was on bail charged with being an accessory to Ms Pal's murder.

A court was told earlier this year that Droudis and Monis vigorously denied the murder allegations and would plead not guilty.

'The charges laid against Amirah Droudis are extremely serious and her alleged actions involve a murder,' Mr Hazzard said in a statement last week.

'This week I asked the DPP to review any cases where bail had been granted where there may have been any similarity to the circumstances of Man Haron Monis.

'In this case the allegation is that he and she had involvement in the murder of Monis' ex-wife.

'On behalf of our community I want to know whether every aspect of her being on bail has been examined in all possible detail.' 

NSW Premier Mike Baird said he shared everyone’s rage that Monis was out on bail.

'The public need to know: We have already taken action and strengthened the bail laws. The new, tougher laws come into effect next month. I am advised that these laws would have succeeded where our old laws have failed us,' he said in a statement. 

'The advice I have from NSW Police is that the hostage taker did not have a gun licence. Questions remain around how he was in possession of a weapon. We will get to the bottom of it. 

'I am determined that we will learn from these events. I’ve announced, along with the Prime Minister, that we will be having a full review of the events leading up to the siege.

'I assure you: If we have to do anything more, we will.' 

Before Droudis married self-styled Sheikh Monis she was known by a different first name - Anastasia, a nod to her Greek heritage.

Born to Greek Orthodox migrants who live in Belmore, south-west Sydney, Droudis worked as a hairdresser in Sydney's Kings Cross during her late teenage years.

As a young adult, she would often visit bars, drink and party with friends, a source previously close to her told Daily Mail Australia.

But after she met the Iranian fanatic in the mid-2000s,  Droudis dropped her birth name in favour of Amirah, an Arabic name, and converted to Islam.

'She's been Anastasia for 30 years,' the source said. 'You can't just turn around and say, 'I'm whatever now''.

The source said she became 'influenced' by Monis after the two struck up a relationship following the collapse of her former relationship with her previous partner of eight years.

Amirah's brother, John Aspros, told Daily Mail Australia this week that Monis often spent time at the home of Amirah's parents, which was raided by NSW Police officers following the bloody end to the Lindt cafe siege on Tuesday.

Droudis declined to comment outside her home this week and later reported to Campsie Police Station where she is required to appear each day as part of her bail conditions. 

Sydney lawyer Manny Conditsis, who represented Monis and Droudis in court, told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday that Droudis was a pleasant client to work with.

'She's always extremely courteous, pleasant,' he said. 'But… it's also fair to observe that she would defer to Monis.'

Attorney General Brad Hazzard has expressed concern to the Director of Public Prosecution over Droudis' bail after two people died when her husband took 18 people hostage in the Lindt cafe on Monday

Droudis declined to comment outside her home last week. She was pictured attending Campsie Police Station last week, where is required to appear each day as part of her bail conditions.   

Four years before the alleged murder, a woman believed to be Droudis, posted a series of chilling videos on YouTube in which she described acts of terrorism as God's will. The videos bear the address of Monis' website. 

'I regret to say I am a terrorist. I admit and formally confess that for many years I have been a terrorist, but I'll try not to be anymore,' says the woman, 'Amirah', in one of the videos, whose face is mostly covered by a niqab.

In another video post, the women describes acts including the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and the Bali bombings as 'acts of God.'

Bailed: Droudis was pictured at Campsie Police Station last Tuesday, hours after her family's home in Belmore was raided by authorities following her husband's siege. Reporting to police is part of the condition of her bail on charges of murdering Noleen Hayson Pal, Monis' ex-wife

'Yes, we are happy about the punishment of September 11. Yes, we are happy about the punishment in Bali. Yes, we are happy about the punishment of the Holocaust and any other punishment that God sends to us.'

The video provoked a media storm at the time they were first posted, but no charges were laid. 

At around the same time both Monis and Droudis were charged with sending offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed by insurgents in Afghanistan.

Relatives said the letters accused the troops of killing innocent children, among other things. Monis and Droudis were eventually convicted and sentenced to community service.

In addition to the murder accessory charge, Monis was facing more than 40 sexual assault charges involving seven women that allegedly took place while he posed as a 'spiritual adviser'. Droudis was not involved in that case.
