It's a label she has turned to on multiple occasions - most notably when she first stepped out following the birth of Prince George - and tonight, the Duchess
of Cambridge dazzled in her favourite British designer, Jenny Packham.

Kate, 31, looked resplendent in a bespoke black dress by the brand she helped catapult to international fashion fame.

Kate joined Prince William at a lavish State Reception thrown by Governor General Sir Jerry Mateparae, the Queen’s representative in New Zealand, at his official residence, Government House.

As appropriate as ever, Kate had her dress hand-stitched with
silver beading to represent New Zealand's national emblem.

Stunning: The Duchess of Cambridge dazzled in a black gown by Jenny Packham as she joined Prince William at a lavish State Reception

The Queen
has long employed the trick of incorporating an item of national importance in
her outfits when on foreign tours - and it appears that the Duchess has now
taken a leaf out of her book.

This isn't the first time Kate has paid tribute to her host country; Kate famously wore a red hat decorated with maple leaves, the official symbol of Canada, on Canada Day during her visit there in 2011.

Although tonight was not a 'tiara-worthy' occasion, the reception is still one of
the glitziest engagements of their three-week tour of New Zealand and Australia
and all eyes were on the dazzling Duchess.

She wore her hair in her trademark loose flowing waves and complemented the gown with blue court shoes - one of her style staples.

At 6.45pm
the couple came down a grand wooden staircase together to be greeted by the
Governor General, Sir Jerry, his wife, Lady Janine, and Mr Key and his wife
Bronagh.

They then
undertook a lengthy line up, shaking the hands of each of their 198 guests,
comprised of senior politicians, MPS and notable figures from public life
including the Chief Justice, Dame Sian Elias, and the Dean of the Diplomatic
Corps, Christine Chretien. 

William and
Kate were next ushered into the Blundell Room - where their son George, who was
sleeping upstairs with his nanny, had played on the carpet just a day earlier -
for official photographs.

Finally it was
time to join their guests for a glass on local wine and canapés
showing off the best of local produce in the Ballroom, heralded by a flourish
of trumpets from the six-strong Lance of Trumpeters.

Though not an official symbol of New Zealand the silver fern has become a quasi-national emblem.It's often used in official symbols, including the coat of arms of New Zealand and the New Zealand one dollar coin.A number of New Zealand sports teams, such as the cricket team, the Silver Ferns and the All Blacks, use similar silver fern flags as part of their official merchandise.

The last time Kate wore a Jenny Packham creation at a black tie gala at the National Portrait Gallery in February, having first worn it in October at a Kensington Palace dinner.

She also stepped out in the trusty designer for the first time following the birth of Prince George. The Duchess wore a glittering floor-length gown she accompanied husband William to the Tusk foundation gala dinner at The Royal Society in London back in September last year.

She even left hospital after the birth of Prince George wearing in a blue and white polka dot dress, which she wore to introduce the baby prince to the world.

As one of the most emulated, adored 
and scrutinised wardrobes in the world, Kate's Jenny Packham outfit 
attracted almost as much attention as the Royal baby.

So much so that one of the biggest clothing brands in the country saw polka dot dresses like Kate's sell out within hours.

The Jenny Packham label was founded in 1988 designing bridal dresses and evening wear and has since acquired fans such as Emma Roberts and Dita Von Teese.

Earlier today, all eyes were on Kate 
as she and the Duke of Cambridge arrived in the town of Blenheim, 
situated in the heart of Marlborough wine country, to take part in a 
service of remembrance for New Zealand's war dead and to lay a wreath in
 their memory.

She wore
 a military blue coat by Alexander McQueen, the same British high-end 
label the Duchess chose to design her wedding gown and has worn on 
countless occasions.

Kate paired the piece, 
which featured exquisite tailoring and a belt around the middle, with 
navy-blue pump heels and a matching clutch.

Unlike a day earlier when her 
brunette locks fell free around her face - and even received a playful 
tug from baby George - the Duchess opted to keep her hair in a 
conservative looped ponytail.

The
 chic look was styled by the Duchess' hairdresser Amanda Cook Tucker, 
who is traveling with the family for the duration of the three-work 
Royal Tour.

The
 32-year-old accessorised with some sentimental jewellery - a friendship
 bracelet given to her by a member of the gathered crowd at Blenheim, 
and what appeared to be purple sapphire earrings.

Fit for a princess:  The Duchess of Cambridge 
chose a tailored military blue coat by her favourite designer Alexander 
McQueen for a remembrance service in the New Zealand town of Blenheim on
 Thursday

All blue: Kate's coat was perfectly tailored, 
which she paired with dark blue pump heels,  a clutch, and sapphire 
earrings - to match the sapphire ring she wears which belonged to the 
late Princess Diana

All in the details: The ensemble featured a belt
 around the middle, large pockets on the front and pleats on the back of
 the lower-half
