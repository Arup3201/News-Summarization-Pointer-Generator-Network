Savannah Guthrie has shared an adorable new photograph showing her growing daughter Vale as the little girl turns one month old.

In the photograph shared to her Facebook profile on Wednesday, the 42-year-old Today show co-host grins as she hugs baby Vale, who sports a large button reading: 'One month.'

After Guthrie, who has been on maternity leave since early August, posted the image, her Facebook page was inundated with warm wishes from her fans and friends.

'Gorgeous, just like her mumma!' said one, while another added: 'Enjoy your time at home with her. Miss you every morning while watching Today.'

Savannah responded: 'Thank you for all these sweet, sweet wishes!!'

The new mom, who documented her pregnancy month-by-month with her adoring fan base, has been delighting her social media followers with regular photos and updates of Vale.

Savannah and her husband, Mike Feldman, 45, welcomed their daughter on August 13. She weighed a healthy 8.5lb and measured 19.5inches.

'[Vale] has blue eyes, a little bit of blondish hair and the chubbiest cheeks you’ve ever seen,' she said shortly after her birth. 'I think we found heaven in this little hospital room in New York City.'

Speaking to her Today colleagues shortly after the birth of her 'cherubic, angel' baby, Savannah said she 'felt like life had just started'.

She revealed: 'I can't get over the joy that she brings, it's almost inexpressible.'

When asked how she and her husband came up with the name Vale, Savannah said: 'Today viewers had me convinced that we were having a boy, so when it was a girl, it was a shock.

'We had a few names on the girl list but we had not settled on it. Vale had always been on our list of names we had liked. We thought it was pretty, unique but not kooky or weird.'

She also mentioned that both she and Mike had been crying spontaneously, and that 'he doesn't even have the hormones to blame.'

And it's not just Savannah who's welcomed a new addition to the family. The Today show has been experiencing a mighty baby boom this summer.

On August 22, Jenna Wolfe announced that she and her partner, NBC News foreign correspondent Stephanie Gosk, are expecting a girl, due in February.

And on August 20, Carson Daly and his fiancee, Siri Pinter, welcomed a daughter, London Rose Daly.
