Police provided this mugshot of John M. Dubis, 49, of Coventry, R.I. after his Hamptons' arrest

An obsessed stalker, who allegedly managed to live in Jennifer Lopez's pool house for six days without being noticed, posted creepy pictures from inside the grounds online as he ranted about being married to the star.

Retired fireman John Dubis, 49, slept on a couch in the pool shed at the $10 million Hamptons property and even parked his car in front of the star's home during his stay between August 3 and August 9, according to police.

Under the pseudonym David A Lopez, Dubois' online posts are almost solely about J-Lo, including a photo where he is biting a heart-shaped box of chocolates 
with the caption: 'Jenny always sending me love'.

And his latest posts include images that appear to have been taken inside the grounds of the mansion J-Lo bought in 2006 - where he was discovered by police on August 9.

One
image taken on August 8 shows the house's distinctive manicured lawns 
and appears to have been taken from a small outbuilding.

In another post the initials of the star are engraved into a tree and he comments: 'Some more david and jenny art'.

Arrested: John Dubis, pictured, was finally spotted by staff and arrested.

Close access: The stalker showed off how close he was to the star in her guest house

Vandalism: Several posts are of initials or part initials belonging to David Lopez, John Dubis or Jennifer Lopez

Obsessed: John Dubis' entire online profile is dedicated to J-Lo including this post in February

He also posted receipts to prove to his followers that he was in the singer's town of Southampton.

Other images show graffiti he believes to be about J-Lo as he walks around the town.

Both suggest the stalker was able to come and go as he pleased during his stay and underline the fact he went entirely unnoticed by staff

He even
helped clean up a path as J-Lo's security team patrolled the grounds, according to police.

Neighbors also presumed he knew the singer and actress but now admit his behavior was strange.

'Oh,
my, come to think of it, I did find it odd when I saw a man standing 
outside her driveway with the gate closed,' Neighbor Nancy Haverman told
the New York Post.

Coming and going: John Dubois posted his receipts from nearby shops and documented his time living in the Hamptons property

Graffiti: Dubis as David Lopez has posted numerous images of Jennifer Lopez's name scrawled in unusual places

'I figured he was just part of her security crew.'

'It’s
really frightening — you don’t want to be a celebrity. I’m telling you,
it’s a curse. I just hope [J.Lo] gets to enjoy this place just like 
everybody else.'

Dubois was
finally rumbled when a member of staff saw him standing on the back porch and
confronted him.

During his arrest Dubois allegedly told police he was an ex-husband of the singer, and the father of her children.

He also said he pleasured himself in the garden because he thought
J-Lo wanted him to 'spread his seed throughout the world' and she had left the pool house door open for him.

J-Lo was
not at the property at the beginning of the month when the stalker took up his week-long residence.

Sources
close to the star said she was 'completely freaked out' that he could get so close to her home.

She has already taken out a restraining order against
him and ordered
a review of her security before returning this week, according to
sources.

Police in
Southampton confirmed the arrest of Dubois on August 9th.

He was
charged second-degree burglary and first-degree criminal contempt, and two
misdemeanors, fourth-degree stalking and possession of burglar tools. His next
court date is Aug. 28.

Lopez had
bought the Water Mill mansion on 3 acres in May for a reported $10 million.

The
eight-bedroom, 7 1/2-bath home is on a private cul-de-sac. 

It comes
with a pool, pool house, outdoor shower, sauna, steam room and theater.
