Mark Golds has been found guilty of murdering his girlfriend Claire Parrish after he flew into a jealous rage when she tried to end their relationship

A killer who begged police to allow him to 'finish off' his victim after being arrested midway through a knife attack on his girlfriend has been found guilty of murder.

Mark Golds, 46, flew into a jealous rage when his 37-year-old partner Claire Parrish attempted to end their relationship last July due to his 'violent and controlling nature'.

The former nightclub bouncer grabbed a knife and inflicted multiple injuries on his partner at the couple’s home in Harlow, Essex.

Golds was unanimously found guilty of murder by a jury at Chelmsford Crown Court yesterday.

He was jailed for life today and told he must serve at least 15 years behind bars before he is considered for parole.

Police rushed to the scene on the evening of July 15, 2012, and spent 10 minutes battling to arrest the powerful shaven-headed killer.

PC Douglas Lyall told Chelmsford Crown Court that during the scuffle Golds said: 'Let me finish her off. The bread knife’s still in the room.'

Ms Parrish, a mother of four, was immediately rushed to nearby Princess Alexandra Hospital where she died of blunt force trauma injuries to her abdomen.

Her family have been left devastated by her tragic death and described Golds as a 'monster' in a statement read out following the guilty verdict.

It said: 'Claire was a wonderful young woman. She was the best daughter you could hope for; an amazing mum and nanny who doted on her grandson.

'Mark Golds has not only taken a daughter, he has taken a loving sister, aunt, mum and nanny.

'Claire should have had so many years to watch her young family grow up, but they were brutally taken from her; leaving a family shattered and one which will never recover. 

'These 10 months have been sheer hell.

'This monster has not only murdered Claire, but he has destroyed her family. One evil act, so many ruined lives.'

Golds was unanimously found guilty of murder by a jury at Chelmsford Crown Court yesterday. He was due to be sentenced today

Senior Investigating Officer, DCI Stuart Hooper, said: 'Mark Golds is a controlling individual who verbally and physically abused Claire, controlling her over a long period of time until she could take no more. 

'As a manipulative individual, he 
could not face up to the misery he had caused her over the years despite
her being a loving partner and mother.

'She
had never once contacted the police to report his violent behaviour and
so, sadly, we never knew of her tormented life and so could not have 
stopped her suffering.

'This monster has not only murdered Claire, but he has destroyed her family. One evil act, so many ruined lives'

'We only hope that those people, men or women, who are entwined in cruel and unhappy relationships with their partners have the courage to contact us and allow us to help them get out of such terrible times.

'In their bedroom that summer’s evening, Mark Golds turned on Claire in a ferocious and sustained attack which you would not want to imagine.

'He has shown no remorse ever since.'

Today Judge Christopher Ball QC jailed Golds for life and ruled that he must not even be considered for parole until he has spent 15 years in jail.

As he passed sentence Judge Ball told Golds: 'I have to make a judgement on when you attacked her whether you intended to kill her. I am satisfied that was your intention although you were suffering from illness.

'It was a combination of anger, temper, frustration and illness and you resolved to kill her and achieved that purpose.'

Golds sat with his eyes closed in the dock dressed in black as sentence was passed.

The judge continued : 'Claire Parrish died on July 15 last year at your hands - as a violence erupted in the home you shared with her.

'You brought on her much force and violence - a knife, fists and feet were used and she received multiple injuries from one of which she died.

'It's quite plain on the day in question you were unwell. You had been receiving treatment for many years for this personality disorder and yet in the weeks before this ceased your medication creating a risk of a mental disturbance being increased.

'You went to a family party - a situation you were plainly uncomfortable with and she enjoyed. The tension there led to the development of tension and a degree of volatility which resulted in her killing.

'You became involved in an argument - she didn't want to go home and you did - and tension escalated.'

The judge said Golds was told by Ms Parrish that she was 'adamant' he had to go and an argument and violence developed.

'You took a knife from the kitchen with intent to harm her and assaulted her, cutting and stabbing her many times,' said the judge.
