The three U.S. students arrested in Egypt this week for allegedly throwing firebombs at security forces fighting with protesters were today released.

Derrik Sweeney, 19, Luke Gates, 21, and Gregory Porter, 19, were on the roof of a university building near Tahrir Square when they were arrested.

The three students - of Georgetown University, Indiana University and Drexel University respectively - all attend the American University in Cairo.

A court ordered the release of all 
three following their arrest in Cairo on Sunday. Egyptian officials 
anonymously confirmed the news on Thursday.

The elated mother of Mr Sweeney, Joy, said news of their pending release is the best Thanksgiving gift. She hopes her son will head home on Friday.

Mr Sweeney had worked on Barack 
Obama's campaign in 2008, but interned this year with congressman 
Blaine Luetkemeyer in Washington.

Sources in the GOP congressman's office 
said the Missouri native was a 'hard worker' and 'nice' and he worked 
there from February to May.

Mr Porter is originally from 
Pennsylvania and Mr Gates is from Indiana. The three were studying for a
semester in Cairo to improve their Arabic.

Officials at all four universities 
involved were working with the U.S. State Department and 
Egyptâ€™s government to get the Americans released.

Video footage taken from the protests 
shows at least two of the students, their faces covered by bandanas, 
taking part alongside the Egyptians.

Mr Gates, the oldest of the captured students, had been sending tweets from Cairo about attending the massive Egyptian rallies.

'Earlier tonight rubber bullets a charge and then a retreat, my knee and elbow are f****d up,' he wrote during the protests.

'I am a world citizen. Can I renounce my US citizenship on Twitter? haha... Honestly, hopefully I die here'

He also tweets: 'I am a world citizen.
Can I renounce my US citizenship on Twitter? haha'. 'Honestly, 
hopefully I die here,' he says later.

Tens of thousands of protesters filled
Tahrir Square, demanding the country's interim Egyptian rulers hand 
over power to a civilian government.

Joy Sweeney's said earlier that she cannot believe the accusations against him. 'He's a strong 
believer in democracy and the right to it,' she told CNN.

'But I don't believe he would be 
involved with intentionally harming anyone.' She said he is a 
principled person who stands up for his beliefs.

She said he attended previous 
protests but stopped after a demonstration where dozens were killed. He 
had assured his family he was safe.

'He got caught up in the whole college-change-the-world mentality, and he believes in democracy strongly,' she said.
