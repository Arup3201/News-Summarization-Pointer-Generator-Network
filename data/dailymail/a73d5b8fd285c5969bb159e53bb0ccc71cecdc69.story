Rebekah Brooks was told by lobbyists to carefully select which police station she should be taken to for questioning, it emerged last night.

It appears she was encouraged by senior executives at Bell Pottinger, who had links to the police, to rule out stations that gave easy access for the media.

A senior executive at the firm also claimed that the former News International boss was 'in tears' when Rupert Murdoch was attacked during his appearance at the Culture Select Committee.

It has also been revealed that the lobbyists claimed they had access to Vince Cable as well as the Prime Minister.

Tim Collins, the firm's managing director, told undercover reporters that the company had been representing Ms Brooks since she resigned in July over accusations of phone-hacking at the News of the World.

The Independent reported that the firm's advice, from both Mr Collins and chairman David Wilson, even went as far as helping choose the police station she should be questioned at.

Mr Collins said: 'Dave was on the phone..."No that nick's not quite right, no no, that one's got a car park, not that one's down a tunnel"... and I thought he was on to some very dodgy part of the criminal underworld but in fact it was his brother-in-law who's a police officer.'

After her arrest for allegedly assaulting her then husband Ross Kemp in November 2005, she was taken to Wandsworth police station, but released without charge.

The newspaper also reported that Mr Collins claimed Bell Pottinger employees spent a morning giving Ms Brooks a 'very rude' mock interview ahead of her giving evidence to the select committee.

He added: 'We were four hours in a waiting room adjacent to the committee room 
waiting to go in. She was really upset actually, in tears when Rupert 
got attacked because he is her mentor.

'He's almost like a father 
figure to her. I know there are stories about her in the past, I didn't 
know her too well in the past, so I won't comment on whether she was 
ruthless or whatever, I must say I see a very honorable, honest woman 
who's trying to fight to clear her name at the moment.'

The lobbyist also criticised News International's handling of the hacking scandal, saying it had been a PR disaster.

Ms Brooks has not commented on the reports.

Mr Collins, also told reporters posing as potential clients that the Business Secretary could be accessed through his aide Giles Wilkes.

The former Tory MP added that as a result of the relationship Mr Cable had visited a factory owned by a Bell Pottinger client that was seeking help from the Government.

Mr Collins said: ‘Stephen Lotinga, my colleague, knows Giles very well, he headed up the Lib Dem home policy unit until ... the general election so all the people who went into government and became Liberal Democrat special advisers all worked for him.

‘So he knows all of them, still talks to them socially.

‘We actually took a client in to see Giles last week, last Thursday, so it’s not something that is difficult for us to do.’ Undercover reporters filmed executives at Bell Pottinger boasting of their round-the-clock access to David Cameron, William Hague and George Osborne.

The Independent reported that Mr Collins described Mr Cable as ‘cantankerous’ and was recorded saying it was ‘not a problem’ to get a message to the Prime Minister on behalf of clients.

He claimed the firm had succeeded in getting Mr Cameron to speak to the
Chinese premier on behalf of a client within 24 hours of being asked to
do so.

And it was said 
that in return for a £1million fee, the company would act to improve the
image of the totalitarian regime in Uzbekistan, which has one of the 
worst human rights records in the world.

Downing Street was forced on to the back foot by the allegations yesterday – and insisted that the claims of influence were untrue.

But last night Labour wrote to Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O’Donnell calling for an inquiry into the affair.

Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett said: ‘It seems that if you have £1million you can get access to the Prime Minister without anyone knowing about it. That is wrong.’ 

Mr Trickett urged Sir Gus to focus his investigation on claims by Mr Collins that Bell Pottinger had persuaded the Prime Minister to intervene on behalf of the UK engineering firm Dyson earlier this year.

But the Prime Minister’s spokesman suggested Mr Collins had greatly exaggerated the firm’s influence: ‘Clearly it is in their interests to tell their clients that they can provide them with a service and that is what they appear to be doing.

‘It simply isn’t true to say that Bell Pottinger or any other lobbying company has influenced Government policy.’

But the allegations are an embarrassment for a Prime Minister who has pledged to curb lobbying. In a speech in February last year, Mr Cameron described the £2billion lobbying industry as ‘the next big scandal waiting to happen’.

Government
sources last night confirmed that plans for a statutory register of 
lobbyists have been delayed and are unlikely to take force before 2013 
at the earliest.

Yesterday’s
allegations emerged after reporters from the Bureau of Investigative 
Journalism posing as agents of the government of Uzbekistan secretly 
recorded conversations with Mr Collins and other Bell Pottinger 
executives.

Mr Collins 
told the reporters he had worked with Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne in the 
Conservative Party’s research department, where Mr Cameron’s policy guru
Steve Hilton was also a senior figure.

‘I’ve been working with people like Steve Hilton, David Cameron, George Osborne for 20 years-plus. I mean I know all these people, there is not a problem about getting the messages through to them,’ he said.

Bell Pottinger yesterday condemned the undercover operation as an ‘unethical, underhand deception to manufacture a story’.

But Tory backbencher Jesse Norman said the latest disclosures reaffirmed his view that lobbying was a ‘canker on the body politic’.

A spokesman for Mr Cable said Mr Wilkes did know Mr Lotinga, but not especially well.
