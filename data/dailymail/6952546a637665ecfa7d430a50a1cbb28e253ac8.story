Michigan coaches have come under fire for keeping quarterback Shane Morris in Saturday's game following a massive hit that left him barely able to stand.

Morris suffered a series of blows during his team's 30-14 loss to Minnesota but coach Brady Hoke failed to pull him - to the anger of ESPN's game analysts, who branded the decision 'atrocious'.

One tackle in the fourth quarter by Minnesota's Cameron Botticelli left Morris, 20, limping on his left leg and turning to teammate Ben Braden for support.

Then a monster helmet-to-helmet hit by Minnesota's Thieren Cockran  left him struggling to get up off the ground - and fans and commentators wondered if he had suffered a concussion.

Pained: Michigan's Shane Morris winces in pain in the third quarter of an NCAA college game against Minnesota on Saturday evening. He remained in the game despite suffering a number of nasty hits

Still, he remained in the game.

'That No. 7 is still in this game is appalling,' ESPN's Ed Cunningham said. 'It is appalling that he was left in on that play to throw the ball again as badly as he was hit by Cockran.

'He can barely stand, they've got to get him out... That is terrible looking after a young player.'

As the crowd booed, Morris threw an incompletion on the next play and Devin Gardner was eventually put in the game in his place.

Vicious: Morris (7) falls to the ground as he is tackled by Minnesota's Cameron Botticelli in the fourth quarter

Injured: He could be seen writhing around on the ground and reaching for his left ankle after the fall

Struck: Next he was knocked to the ground by Minnesota's Thieren Cockran and struggled to get up

Suffering: He stayed on the ground and grabbed his head after being knocked down - but his coaches said they did not know if he had suffered a concussion and that he could have come off if he wanted to

But when Gardner's helmet was knocked off during a play, Morris was entered again.

'Shane Morris cannot be going back into this game,' Cunningham said. 'This young man looked groggy after that hit, he's being put back on the field. He can barely stand up.

'This is not good player management. We've talked about player safety in this game, guys getting hit in the head. This is atrocious to me.'

As the end of the game, Morris left on a cart.

But Hoke said he hadn't known anything was wrong with his player and didn't see him get hit.

'I don't know if he had a concussion or not,' he told the Detroit Free Press after the game.

Dismissive: Coach Brady Hoke, pictured right during the game, came under fire for failing to pull Morris from the game but he later insisted that the safety of his athletes was his top priority

'Shane's a pretty tough kid and Shane wanted to be the quarterback. Believe me, if he didn't want to be, he would have come to the sideline, or stayed down.'

He would not address the quarterback's status following the game but after being lambasted for his decision to keep Morris on the field, he released a statement defending it.

'The safety of our student-athletes is always our top priority,' he said, SBNation reported.

'Shane Morris was removed from yesterday's game against Minnesota after further aggravating an injury to his leg that he sustained earlier in the contest. He was evaluated by our experienced athletic trainers and team physicians and we're confident proper medical decisions were made.

'The (U-M) has a distinguished group of Certified Athletic Trainers and team physicians who are responsible for determining whether or not a player is physically able to play. 

Struggle: 20-year-old Shane Morris was eventually helped off the field by  tackle Ben Braden, right

'Our coaches have no influence or authority to make determinations if or when an injured player returns to competition. The health and welfare of our student-athletes is and will continue to be a top priority.'

The team was plagued with  injuries throughout the game.

Cornerback Jabrill Peppers was injured in practice - his second injury of the season - and did not appear on the sideline, while lineback Desmond Morgan missed the game due to an arm injury.

Defensive end Brennan Beyer was injured after Michigan's first touchdown, while receiver Devin Funchess was seen limping in the second half.
