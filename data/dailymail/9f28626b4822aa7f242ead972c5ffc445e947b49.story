A last-ditch attempt to bring peace to eastern Ukraine will be put to the country’s leaders today amid warnings that failure to reach a settlement could lead to all-out war.

More than 5,300 people have been killed since the conflict began in April and around a million more have been forced to leave their homes to escape the fighting.

Last night, pro-Russian separatists intensified their shelling of government positions on all front lines and appeared to be massing forces for new attacks on the key railway town of Debaltseve and the coastal city of Mariupol, according to the Ukrainian military authorities.

Today’s peace plan was drawn up by France and Germany during four hours of talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin on Friday.

Details remained under wraps last night but French President Francois Hollande said that one proposal was for a broader demilitarised zone and greater autonomy for eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists are trying to establish a break-away state free from Kiev’s control.

Mr Hollande said the current negotiations were a last chance ‘because if we are not able to reach, not a compromise but a durable peace accord, we perfectly know the scenario: it has one name, it is called war’.

America and Britain have accused Russia of supplying troops and military equipment to the separatists. Mr Putin denies the claim and says the conflict is being fuelled by Western interference.

The fighting has prompted Washington to consider giving lethal weapons to the Ukrainian government, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said this might make things worse.

Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Britain remained a ‘key player’ in efforts to end the conflict and dismissed as ‘ludicrous’ claims by Britain’s former top Nato commander, General Sir Richard Shirreff, that David Cameron had become a ‘diplomatic irrelevance’ in the crisis.
