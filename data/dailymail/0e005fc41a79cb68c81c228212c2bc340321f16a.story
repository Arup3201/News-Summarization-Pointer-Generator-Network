Kate Middleton has seen off competition from a host of stunning celebrities to be named the most naturally beautiful woman in the UK.

The Duchess of Cambridge's classic English rose beauty saw her top the poll ahead of the likes of fresh-faced television presenter Holly Willoughby - who came second - pop princess Cheryl Cole and actresses Keira Knightley and Emma Watson.

Kate's younger sister Pippa crept in at number 10 in the chart, which also features an Olympic athlete and some of the country's most famous yummy mummies.

Olympic golden girl Jessica Ennis' bare-faced beauty earned her the fifth spot in the top ten, and actress Emma Watson's youthful glow won her six per cent of the vote placing her at number six.

The Harry Potter starlet is the youngest in the chart at just 22.

Television presenter and mum of two Myleene Klass - who went make-up free for the cameras during her stint in the jungle as a contestant on I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here - came in at number seven with five per cent of the vote.

Actress Kate Winslet - who at 37 is the oldest of the entries - was voted the eighth most naturally beautiful woman in the UK, followed by Cheryl Cole at number nine and Pippa Middleton at number 10.

Leah Doherty, brand manager for the St. Ives skincare range, which commissioned the poll, said more and more famous women are shunning heavy make-up to embrace a more natural look.

'Celebrities without makeup is almost an alien concept in celeb 
land,' she said.

'However, recently we have noticed a whole host of celebrities from
the likes of Lydia Bright and her TOWIE co-stars to superstar 
songstresses like Lady Gaga and Rihanna all going au natural.'
