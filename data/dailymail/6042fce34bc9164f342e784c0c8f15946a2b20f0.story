Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer both cruised to victories on day three of the ATP Swiss Indoors in Basle.

Nadal reached the quarter-finals in just 57 minutes with a 6-1, 6-1 win against Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert, before top seed Roger Federer crushed Gilles Muller  6-2, 6-1 in just 46 minutes to reach the second round.

Second seed Nadal, playing just his third tournament since Wimbledon due to a wrist injury, broke qualifier Herbert's serve five times.

The Spaniard, who struggled with appendicitis earlier this month in Shanghai, was never troubled by world No 120 Herbert, who double-faulted 11 times.

Nadal did save two break points, including when he was serving for the match. He next plays either Andrey Golubev of Kazakhstan or 17-year-old Croatian wildcard  Borna Coric on Friday.

It was even easier for Federer, who broke Muller in the sixth game and wrapped up the first set in 25 minutes, winning 91 percent of his first-serve points.

The second set was even quicker as Federer totally dominated Muller, who failed to win a single point on Federer's serve, as the 17-time Grand Slam champion's ninth ace took him to match point.

Federer, who improved to 5-0 against Muller in career head-to-heads, next plays Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan and leads him 5-0 too.

Belgium's David Goffin is also through to the quarters after beating Croatia's Ivan Dodig 7-6 (0), 6-4. He next plays either fourth-seeded Milos Raonic of Canada or Donald Young of the United States.

Coric, ranked 124th, caused a big first-round upset when he beat sixth-seeded Ernests Gulbis of Latvia 7-6 (2), 6-3.

Although world No 13 Gulbis, this year's French Open semifinalist, had nine aces, he constantly felt the pressure of Coric's excellent return. He faced 14 break points in the match, dropping his serve three times.

Golubev won 6-3, 6-3 against Teymuraz Gabashvili of Russia.

Meanwhile, Istomin had 14 aces in a 6-1, 6-1 rout of Poland's Jerzy Janowicz, a renowned big server who managed only two aces and lost his serve five times.
