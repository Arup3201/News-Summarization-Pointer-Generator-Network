Dr Nancy Snyderman apologized for violating an Ebola quarantine as she returned to NBC on Wednesday morning and insisted that 'good people make mistakes'.

The NBC News medical correspondent appeared on the Today show for the first time in a month and apologized at length for her mistake before presenting a segment about depression.

'I'm very sorry for not only scaring my community and the country but adding to the confusion of the terms that came as fast and furious as the news about Ebola did,' she told Matt Lauer.

'We had already been taking our temperatures... and we knew our risks in our heads... but we did not really appreciate and - frankly were not sensitive to - how absolutely scared Americans were.'

Apologetic: Dr Nancy Snyderman returned to the Today show on Wednesday after she violated her Ebola quarantine. She apologized for the mistake but said it mustn't distract people from the real story

Snyderman had been reporting on the Ebola outbreak in Liberia for NBC in October at the time a cameraman who briefly worked with her, Ashoka Mukpo, came down with the deadly virus.

Mukpo was transferred back to the U.S. for treatment at a Nebraska medical facility and has since recovered. 

Snyderman and the rest of the NBC team were urged to voluntarily quarantine themselves for a 21-day period upon their return to the United States. 

But during the midst of that quarantine, Snyderman and her crew were spotted getting takeout food from a New Jersey restaurant, prompting New Jersey officials to make her quarantine mandatory.

Neither she nor anyone else from the network came down with Ebola. 

Her takeout foray angered her bosses and unleashed a bitter response online, with some viewers saying that they would have a hard time trusting her again after the mistake in judgment.

NBC News President Deborah Turness told Dr Snyderman to take some time off.

On Wednesday, Snyderman explained: 'It was about breaking a promise and it was also my association with Ashoka Mukpo.

'Good people can make mistakes and I stepped outside the boundaries of what I promised to do and what the public expected of me, and for that I'm sorry.'

But she also added that concern over her story had taken away from 'the real issue at hand' - the suffering she had seen of the virus across West Africa.

Snyderman, 62, will also report on a medical issue for NBC's Nightly News on Wednesday.

There had been some question about whether the veteran medical journalist would ever return to NBC News.  

Snyderman, a surgeon, has been at NBC News since 2006 after spending 17 years as a medical correspondent for ABC News.
