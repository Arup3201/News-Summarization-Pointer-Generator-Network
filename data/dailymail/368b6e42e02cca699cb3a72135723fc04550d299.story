A German hospital is counting the cost of treating a single Ebola patient after being forced to write off £1million worth of equipment after a man infected with the virus vomited on it.

The University Clinic Eppendorf in Hamburg, a specialist centre for contagious diseases, gave the man intensive treatment for five weeks after he became infected while working for the World Health Organisation in Sierra Leone in August.

The treatment worked and the patient was declared Ebola-free and released earlier this month.

But during his stay the man, a Senagalese scientist, first vomited on a mobile x-ray machine and then on an equally expensive ultrasound scanner, said the clinic's medical director, Christian Gerloff.

Both machines now needed to be written off, he said.

The standard cost of five weeks of treatment at the clinic is around £250,000 - a cost the will be borne by the WHO.

But the clinic would have to meet the costs of replacing the new machines, which was around £1m, Dr Gerloff said.

'The costs involved are extreme, it is difficult to even put a figure on,' he said. 

'Only the costs of treatment will be picked up by the World Health Organisation for who the doctor was working, but not the damage which will have to be covered by insurance,' he said. 

The expensive machines now need to be replaced at a cost of around £1million, said hospital medical director Christian Gerloff (stock image)
