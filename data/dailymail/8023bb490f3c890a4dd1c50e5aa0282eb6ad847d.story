The England bid team for the 2018 World Cup should come clean if they attempted any vote swaps, a former chairman of the Football Association has said.

Lord Triesman, who was also chairman of the 2018 bid until 2010, said England should not advocate greater transparency from other countries than it was prepared to apply to itself.

His comments came as he launched a renewed attack on the world governing body FIFA during a House of Lords debate on sports governance.

In the latest in a string of allegations about the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, won by Russia and Qatar respectively, both countries, along with England have been accused of breaking FIFA rules.

A dossier compiled by the Sunday Times and published at the weekend by the Culture, Media and Sport select committee accused Russia and Qatar of engaging in vote-trading and vote-buying while England's 2018 bid are alleged to have engineered a failed vote-swap with their counterparts in the South Korea 2022 bid.

All three organisations have always denied any wrongdoing in their bids to host the tournaments, and a report recently by Hans-Joachim Eckert, the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of FIFA's ethics committee, cleared Russia and Qatar to stage the tournaments.

The Sunday Times claims the allegations it submitted to Parliament were contained within a database which it says was compiled by England's 2018 bidding team.

The chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee, John Whittingdale, admitted none of the allegations in the Sunday Times dossier had been proven but said they gave the impression of FIFA being a 'deeply corrupt organisation'.

After setting out the recent attempts by FIFA to investigate corruption claims, Lord Triesman said: 'It would all beggar belief, but not quite enough disbelief in a way.

'The England 2018 bid team apparently also have a secret dossier with potential evidence of corruption.

'When asked by Mr Justice Dingemans and also I think by the select committee, they said they had no further information.

'I would love to have seen it. It would have gone immediately to Mr John Whittingdale and his committee and they would have been the people to judge whether it was appropriate to move further and not those who really didn't want it to be seen.

'FIFA needs root and branch reform. Its culture will not be changed by tweaking the processes. Culture is always stronger than process. Mr (Sepp) Blatter (FIFA president) and the old school must go. His intention to run again is bad for sport.

'The Swiss government should be involved, the major sponsors should be involved and I believe the bids for the World Cup in 2018 and 2022 should be re-run.

'If England has anything to say about vote swapping that is not to its credit then let's come clean as well and not advocate for others what we are not prepared to do for ourselves.'

Setting out the recent situation at FIFA, Lord Triesman, a Labour peer, said: 'Systematic corruption over decades overseen by a group who have been there for decades; World Cups awarded by committee nearly half of whom have been compelled to go and some of whom jumped before that point.

'Whistle blowers and investigative journalists disregarded; no embarrassment quite enough to prompt any action.

'A senior United States lawyer appointed to investigate but not to see the people who had already been exposed as corrupt, nor to view the huge Sunday Times documentation.

'Mr (Michael) Garcia writes a long report that isn't to be published. A German lawyer employed by FIFA writes a summary. Mr Garcia denounces it four hours later as inaccurate and defective. Still no one wants to publish the actual document.

'Candidly, I was surprised to be criticised for not helping Mr Garcia although I was subject to a sub judice restriction because I was being sued by a member of the FIFA executive for suggesting there might be corruption in that organisation.'

Triesman added his voice to calls for Michael Garcia's (left) report into FIFA ethics to be fully published

Garcia's report has only been published as a summary by FIFA, something Garcia himself quickly denounced

Opening the debate, Lord Moynihan, a former chairman of the British Olympic Association and sports minister, called for a wide-ranging overhaul of British sports governance.

The Tory peer has put forward a backbench Bill on the issue that would bring in a string of measures aimed at improving the situation.

'The need for good governance in sport is no less or more than the requirement for FTSE companies and is essential if we are to protect the interests of athletes in the future,' he said.

'Only by demonstrating good governance in sport, can governance and British sports administrators use their influence internationally to good effect.'
