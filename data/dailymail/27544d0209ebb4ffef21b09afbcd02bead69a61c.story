Reality TV stars Lateysha Grace and Carley Belmonte have been competing against each other in a weight loss battle after being hurt by cruel comments about their figures on Twitter.

The Valleys co-stars packed their bags and headed to boot camp where they both lost half a stone in time for the new season of their MTV show.

A bit of friendly competition combined with the boot camp’s tough exercise regime and healthy diet plan proved to be the winning formula when it came to weight loss.

Let the battle commence! The Valleys stars Lateysha Grace and Carley Belmonte have been competing against each other in a weight loss battle at boot camp

20 year-old Lateysha slimmed down from 11st to 10st 7lb and lost 12 inches of fat as she toned all sections of her body and dropped a dress size.

She
 lost an inch under her arms and back, two inches off her waist, three 
inches off each of her hips and three inches off her waist.

Lateysha said: 'I am so happy with my body now.

'The kind of comments I was getting on Twitter were disgusting but I was determined to put everything right so I could once again feel confident about my appearance. Now I feel fantastic.'

And her 22 year-old friend Carley wasn’t far behind when it came to shedding extra pounds gained while filming the hit MTV show, which returns in the New Year.

Speaking about her 11.5in shrinkage, Carley said: 'It’s so hard to lose the weight and so easy to put it on. When we were filming I was drinking every night and was eating rubbish at all the wrong times. I needed to detox.

'The weight loss has been amazing. I’m feeling good and I’m determined to keep the weight off this time.'

Lateysha put on a stone during the last series. She said: 'It is impossible to keep your weight under control on The Valleys. We are drinking all the time and living off takeaways.

'My weight fluctuates massively - on a bad week, I can put on 5lbs so I have to be very careful.

'The flipside is that I can also lose weight very easily.'

She's back! Carley (left, before boot camp; right, after), who was paying a second visit to boot camp, lost 2 inches from her waist and hips and 3.5 inches from her bust

Lateysha said that being overweight shattered her self-esteem. 'I feel disgusting when I am overweight. You always get a lot of abuse on Twitter. I was continually dubbed "fatty". It can affect my self-esteem so much that I don't feel that I look good in anything.'

Lateysha is hoping her days of yo-yo dieting are over after the trip to boot camp.

'It is the hardest thing I have ever done,' she explained.

'I almost threw up on the first day after they told us we'd have to go for a three-mile run.'

Carley from Caerphilly, visited the same military diet camp in November and lost 10lbs after cruel fans branded her 'a whale’ on Twitter.

But when her party lifestyle started up again she piled on a stone in five weeks seeing her weight jump to 11st 2lbs.

Carley said: 'I’m working really hard to get back down to my ideal weight of 10st 2lbs but I don’t care what people say.

'Going back was tough. I knew what was in store. I was getting up at 6am every morning and it killed me. I was craving chocolate the whole time.

'It took so much out of me physically and emotionally but it was worth it. Now I know it’s a lifestyle overhaul, not just a quick fix.'

This time Carley lost 2 inches from her waist and hips, 2.5 inches from her upper legs and 3.5 inches from her bust.

She said: 'My bust shrunk again, my boobs have gone on tour!'

But Carley admits attending the camp with her friend Lateysha helped keep her focused this time around. 

She said: 'It was Lateysha's first time and she cried after the fitness test! And seeing her get in an ice bath was hilarious - she wouldn’t stop screaming. But it made it easier with her there; a bit of friendly competition doesn’t hurt anyone.'

Tough: They both found the week extremely hard and were put through gruelling military-style fitness tests

Now Carley is taking elements of the strict regime and incorporating them into her new and improved lifestyle.

She said: 'I’ve been doing boxercise classes since I’ve got back and I’m eating healthily now – no more pizza! I really want to stay on track.'

And Lateysha from Port Talbot, Neath feels the same way. She said: 'They have got me into all sorts of good habits. I have developed exercise regimes which work for me and I can see the benefits of a low-fat diet.

'I am drinking three or four litres of water a day - which really cleans out your system, does wonders for your skin and makes you feel so much better.

Making a change: The girls are taking elements of the strict regime and incorporating them into their new and improved lifestyles

'I have reached a weight that I am comfortable with and looks good on me. But I am never going to be mega skinny - there will always be a bit of bum and boob.'

No 1 Boot Camp, where the girls stayed, sees a 40 per cent jump in orders at this time of year as women in particular plan drastic New Year diets.

Lateysha is looking forward to starring in the new series of The Valleys which starts in February.

A thrilled Lateysha added: 'I am particularly grateful to No 1 Boot Camp for helping me to lose all that weight and get my body in shape. Here’s to a hit and healthy 2014.'
