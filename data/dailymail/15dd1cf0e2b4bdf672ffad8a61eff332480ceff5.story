A British holidaymaker was killed by a Spanish mob when a birthday celebration turned into an orgy of unprovoked violence, a court heard.

Father-of-three Stephen Mallon, 49, was fatally injured after being attacked by armed locals and pushed from a 16ft ledge, Malaga Criminal Court was told.

The Glasgow-born roofer, who lived in Bournemouth, Dorset, died 11 days after the incident in June 2009, after failing to come out of a coma.

His twin sons Peter and Carl, 16 at the time, suffered broken bones after being punched and attacked with a metal pole. They were left with post-traumatic stress caused by their ordeal, a state lawyer claimed.

Yesterday, 15 Spanish men took the witness stand as defendants.

State prosecutors are indicting one for Mr Mallon’s homicide, one for assault with a dangerous weapon and 13 for affray. Prosecutors acting for his family in a parallel private prosecution are seeking homicide convictions for two of the 15.

Mr Mallon’s widow Teresa, 47, and university graduate daughter Jenny, 25, were in court to hear how their loved ones and three British friends of the twins were targeted in a mass attack involving up to 30 Spaniards from the mountain village of Competa, near Malaga, and the surrounding area.

Trouble 
flared at a disco-pub called La Estrella in the village, just under an 
hour’s drive from the Costa del Sol. Reports at the time claimed the mob
 were ‘anti-British’.

However, several defendants claimed that problems started after one of the twins danced with the girlfriend of one of the men.

He is accused of smashing Mr Mallon over the head with a beer bottle.

State
 prosecutor Cecilia Solana told the court the defendants had used 
weapons including metal poles, glass bottles, plant pots and belts.

She said: ‘All the defendants were willing participants. The wronged Brits could only defend themselves against the blows they received.’

Prosecutors accused Jose Ivan Jimenez Martin of pushing Mr Mallon off a ledge near a pizza restaurant onto a concrete floor below.

Private prosecutor Javier Florido told the court: ‘Despite lying unconscious and seriously injured on the floor, it didn’t stop some of the defendants continuing to kick and hit him.

‘Because of the fall and the injuries he suffered, Stephen Mallon was rushed to hospital, where he died on June 17, 2009.’

The accused claim the tourists were the aggressors in a ‘fight’. All those who admitted involvement claimed they acted in self-defence.

Miguel Jimenez Martin, brother of the man accused of Mr Mallon’s homicide, told the court most of the 30 Spaniards outside the disco-bar were not involved in the violence.

He added: ‘My brother defended himself from the older Brit after he attacked him. I saw a scuffle and then the foreigner disappeared.’

State prosecutors want Jose Ivan Jimenez Martin sentenced to 12 years in prison if convicted.Private prosecutors want him jailed for 15 years, along with a second man accused of attacking Mr Mallon with a bottle.

The trial, expected to last five days, continues today.

All 15 defendants have pleaded not guilty, although some of those facing lesser charges have admitted to the accusations against them but are contesting the jail sentence demands.
