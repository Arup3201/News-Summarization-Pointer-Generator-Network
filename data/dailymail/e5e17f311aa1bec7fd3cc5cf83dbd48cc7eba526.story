Denial: Comedian David Baddiel (pictured) has dismissed a newspaper report that he was going to take the Class A drug MDMA live on TV

Comedian David Baddiel has dismissed a newspaper report that he is planning to take Class A drugs live on TV as part of a scientific study.

The Sun said the Three Lions star was going to sample MDMA for a Channel 4 series and then talk about its effects.

But Baddiel, 47, has branded the claims a 'lie'.

Writing on Twitter today, he said: 'For those congratulating me...I'm not going to be taking ecstasy live on C4.

'I believe it was written in The Sun? So, y'know: it's a lie.'

MDMA, a pure form of ecstasy which causes euphoria and reduces anxiety, was made illegal in 1977.

Scientists on the C4 show Drug Live are trying to establish if it can benefit people with post-traumatic stress disorder.

The series, hosted by newsreader Jon Snow and Embarrassing Bodies presenter Dr Christian Jessen, will be examining the claims and counter-claims made about the effects of recreational drugs by testing them on live television.

Channel 4 said individuals will be filmed as they use different substances 'under strict medical supervision and in a controlled clinical environment'.

Their physical and psychological effects will then be monitored, as will their social interaction with others as the drugs enter their systems.

Other celebrities are said to be taking part, although it is not known if they will be taking substances or merely forming part of the discussions.

The four-part series, which airs in July, will also feature politicians, police officers and clergymen.

Recreational drugs were used by 2.8million adults in England alone from 2009 to 2010, yet their dangers are disputed, with opinion having been divided between government policy-makers and scientists.

The last Government dismissed its own chief scientific advisor and another expert has described the current classification of drugs as â€˜a very British farce'.

Specialist Factual Commissioning Editor David Glover says: 'This subject is fraught with controversy and confusion - this series will provide viewers with unmediated access to a live drug trial.

'Viewers will be able to see for themselves the actual effects the drugs have in scientific detail.

'We will work closely with the leading research institutes from across the world. The aim is to bring new clarity to the facts of illegal drug use.'

Baddiel shot to fame in 1988 with the Radio 1 show The Mary Whitehouse Experience before teaming up with comedy partner Frank Skinner for the hugely popular Fantasy football League and later the TV series Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned.

The duo twice topped the charts with the football anthem Three Lions written for the Euro 96 championships.
