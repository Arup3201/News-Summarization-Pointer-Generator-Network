A second Australian has died surfing in Indonesia in as many months, as the search for another missing man continues.

Friends of the latest victim found him floating in the surf about 100 metres from the shore at Sorga Beach in Lombok on Friday morning, local police say.

The 54-year-old was 'very weak' when he was helped from the water and taken to a local clinic where he died a short time later.

A 48-year-old man was pulled 'very weak' from the water at Sorga Beach in Lombok in Indonesia on Friday

'We suspect he was hit by a harsh wave,' police chief Arif Budiman said.

The man had been staying in the area for three days, he said.

His death comes after Australian Peter Luke, 27, died after being hit by a huge wave on a remote beach on the island of Sumbawa last month.

Mr Luke, originally from Warrnambool in Victoria, was surfing five-metre waves when his friends lost sight of him, and eventually found his body on a nearby reef.

The search continues for 46-year-old Queensland man Peter Maynard who was last seen on August 27 off the coast of Nusa Lembongan island

Meanwhile, on Nusa Lembongan, a small island just off the coast of Bali, the search continues for missing Queenslander Peter Maynard.

The father-of-three from Noosa on the Sunshine Coast was last seen on August 27.

His family, who arrived on the island on Friday, believe he went for a surf on that morning.

Police say the conditions that day were relatively calm.
