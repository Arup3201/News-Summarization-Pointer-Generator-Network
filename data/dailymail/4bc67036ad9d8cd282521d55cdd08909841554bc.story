Dramatic video footage has been released which shows a lifeguard saving people from dangerous rip currents off a beach in Cornwall yesterday.

A young body boarder and a swimmer in difficulty are both seen being pulled onto a board by a lifeguard who has paddled out to save them.

The rescues took place yesterday on the popular beach resort of Chapel Porth in Cornwall and follow last week's dramatic rescue of a young boy at Crooklets Beach in Bude.

Last week Royal National Lifeboat Institute (RNLI) lifeguard Joby Wolfenden-Brown picked up the screams of a young boy on his head-mounted GoPro and paddled out to save him.

The latest footage from the helmet-mounted cameras of lifeguards captures a boy and then an older male swimmer grabbing the rescue board and clambering onto it before being paddled back to the beach.

British coast deaths have reached record highs says the RNLI, which today launched a campaign, 'Respect the Water'.

Death rates along Britain's coast last year were the highest in four years, says the organisation, which revealed that more people were killed at the coast last year than the numbers who died in cycling accidents.

Figures show that 167 people died in water-related accidents , and a further 368 were rescued by lifeguard crews after getting into difficulties.

As temperatures continue to soar and people take to the coasts for the school holidays, the RNLI stressed that people must focus on safety in and around the water.

'We really feel that that number is too high and we need to do something about it, said RNLI coastal safety manager Ross Macleod ahead of the campaign launch in Brighton today by England rugby player James Haskell.
