Queuing round the block in the cold, these women look like they are waiting patiently to purchase a new gadget or coveted sports tickets.

But in fact, they are queuing up in the darkness to join a new branch of the Women's Institute (WI).

More than 60 women turned up to the Downend WI's first monthly meeting at Christ Church Hall in Bristol in a bid to sign up.

A long wait: Dozens of women queue round the block in the cold to join a new branch of the Women's Institute

All smiles: The new group was set up by Tracey Simmonds (left), 37, who pulled together a committee of nine women to organise the first meeting. Right, Julia Tilley, 35, was among the women queuing up to join the group

The group hopes to accommodate women who have been turned away from nearby Bromley Heath WI, which attracted a record-breaking 350 people on its opening night a few months ago.

It was set up by Tracey Simmonds, 37, who pulled together a committee of nine women to organise the first meeting.

'My husband Andrew is in the Round Table charity and always has a lot of fun, so I thought to myself  "I want a bit of this!",' she said. 

'Despite the recession, people still want to enjoy themselves, even though they might not have much money.

Popular: The WI's popularity is believed to have been spurred on by TV programmes such as Great British Bake Off and Great British Sewing Bee, as well as Facebook. Above, Linda Russ hopes to enroll for the new group

'People also have such busy lives these days, meaning they have no time to meet new friends and have new experiences.

'The WI gives them a chance to meet once a month and enjoy a sense of community at low cost.'

Sarah Byfield, 31, was among the dozens of women queuing round the block in Downend.

She said: 'There’s nothing like this in the area and it sounds really varied and interesting. I thought I would dip my toe in and find out more about it.

'I’ve got a full-time job and I am member of the PTA at my son’s school so this will be something for me.'

Another applicant Melanie Gale, 50, said she had tried to join the WI many years ago, but had felt too young for the crowd.

Jam and Jerusalem: Members of the British Women's Institute making jam in 1941 - and it's still popular now

'I think they were all over 60 and I felt I didn’t fit in,' she said. 'I have always wanted to join the WI because I think it’s a bit more dynamic these days, with a lovely mix of ages.

'I enjoy a lot of things they put on such as craft working and campaigning on issues.

'I have got a lot of friends at work but I don’t know many people in the area so I am really looking forward to joining.'

The WI, which was set up in 1915 to 
harness the spirit of the First World War, is best known for jam-making 
and for its anthem, Jerusalem.

The iconic organisation famously put former prime minister 
Tony Blair in his place in June 2000 when he was subjected to a slow 
handclap at a speech to their conference.

Its increasing popularity is believed to have been spurred on by TV programmes such as Great British Bake Off 
and Great British Sewing Bee, as well as social-networking sites like 
Facebook.

Ms Simmonds said the Downend WI has an extensive range of activities planned for the coming year, including Indian cookery, button art and even zorbing.

'The choices are limitless,' she said. 'We can have talks, do cookery, craft work, photography.

'As we progress, I envisage lots of sub groups which can run their own workshops.'

Speech: Queen Elizabeth II opens the first ever WI Life and Leisure Exhibition in London in 1984

Established in 1915, the Women's Institute (WI) is the largest voluntary women's organisation in the UK.

It was initially formed to revitalise rural communities and encourage women to become more involved in producing food during the First World War.

However, since then, the organisation's aims have broadened - with more than 200,000 women currently members of around 6,600 WI branches.

The WI provides women with educational opportunities and the chance to build new skills, as well as the opportunity to campaign on a range of issues - from children's diets and human trafficking to healthy eating and the environment.

In the past 100 years, it has campaigned successfully to have District Nurse Clinics available in rural communities, a phone box set up in every village, and a public loo erected in every popular tourist spot.

And during
 World War II, its members' ‘Jam Busters’ effort enabled the nation’s bread to 
be spread with vitamin-rich home-made jam, bottled by volunteers slaving
 away in small kitchens across Britain.

In 1984, Queen Elizabeth II opened the first ever WI Life and Leisure Exhibition in London.

In recent years, some women have even stripped off for a calendar, raising £3 million for cancer research.

And
 in 2000, at their Wembley AGM, WI member slow-hand-clapped Tony Blair when 
he turned his ill-prepared speech into a party political 
broadcast.
