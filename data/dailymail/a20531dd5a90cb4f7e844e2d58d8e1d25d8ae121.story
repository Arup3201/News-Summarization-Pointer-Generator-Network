Three students from a top high school in a wealthy community in Upstate New York have been arrested after they allegedly abducted 15 eighth grade boys, forced them into cars and flogged them with a board at a remote wildlife preserve.

Police say the violent attacks were part of an annual 'Freshman Fridays' hazing ritual that has persisted for years. School officials warned parents that their children could be targeted, but were evidently powerless to stop the assaults.

One of the boys was beaten so badly on Friday that he had to be hospitalized, according to authorities.

Hiding: Tristan Scragg. 17, tries to conceal his face from cameras after he was arrested on charges he kidnapped and beat younger students

Accountable: Sean Pinson, 17, and Max Meyerson, 16, also tried to dodge the cameras as they ran to waiting cars after their release from jail

Police in Westchester County say Sean Pinson and Tristan Scragg, both 17, and Max Meyerson, 16, snatched 15 boys from the public library in Rye, New York, and drove them to a secluded nature preserve.Â 

The abducted teens were all middle school students who will be freshman at Rye High School next year. According to students, the prestigious public school has a tradition of juniors initiating the new students into high school with pranks and hazing.

'It's been happening for a number of years,' a Rye High School student told WABC.

'They don't usually do anything about it, the cops.'

This year, threats to the younger students were so real that a middle school principal sent parents a note warning them to be on the lookout for marauding high school boys.

'Fear is in the air at Rye Middle School. There is a lot of chatter that June 4 is Freshman Friday, and eighth grade boys are fearful they are going to be attacked by balloons filled with Nair and have their bottoms smacked with paddles. It is hard to tell what is rumor and what is actually going to happen,' Rye Middle School principal Ann Edwards wrote, according to local blog MyRye.com.

'For several years, an odious spring tradition has taken place in Rye: junior boys paddle eighth grade boys off school grounds. In recent years we have heard of fewer instances of paddling, but the practice has not been extinguished.'

That fear was apparently warranted. Driving in two cars, Pinson, Scragg ad Meyerson picked up the students and took them to Marshlands Concervancy in Rye.

There, police say, they used a 'large piece of lumber' to wallop the younger boys. One of the middle schoolers had to be treated at a hospital after the assault.

Despite claims that the behavior has taken place for years, superintendent Edward Shine told WABC that the schools have been working to stop it.

'Some have suggested that these alleged acts are part of an annual "tradition" at Rye High School. Let me be clear: just because a small handful of students choose to believe that this is the case, does not make it a fact. Our school district and our educators put a premium on student safety, respect, and dignity, and work diligently each day to inspire these traits in our students,' he said.
