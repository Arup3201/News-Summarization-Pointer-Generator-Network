Raising a glass: Rosdeep Kular enjoys a drink at a social occasion

Self-confessed social butterfly Rosdeep ‘Rosie’ Kular has enjoyed the company of a mixed band of friends since her marriage broke down in 2009.

She recently launched a mobile beauty business and has attempted to juggle a career with looking after five children, all under the age of 10.

But the 33-year-old also has a love of partying, which has taken her into a world far removed from her respectable upbringing as the daughter of a local doctor.

Photographs on her Facebook page show the woman nicknamed the ‘dancing queen’ posing with a number of friends, including Mohammed Abdi, 25, who died in a shooting in Edinburgh last year.

The day after his murder, Ms Kular posted a picture of herself with Mr Abdi, who was often seen at her flat in the Drylaw area of Edinburgh. According to neighbours, he sometimes took her children to school.

Taken in a pub or club, he is seen in the photograph with his arms protectively around her, while she looks happy and relaxed.

Mr Abdi, whose father was an Imam at the Edinburgh Central Mosque, died on May 26 last year. Six men deny his killing and are set to stand trial in April.

It is clear Ms Kular enjoyed playing up to her party-loving image, claiming in one online profile: ‘Just me, myself and I….oh yeah, with a brood of five monsters, six if you count the man indoors!’ She also jokes: ‘Work full time which is a bit crapiola but it’s got to be done eh!’

Yesterday, the parents of her estranged husband, Omotoso Adekoya, who is originally from Nigeria, revealed they had reservations about her party lifestyle. They claim Mr Adekoya objected and it led to a separation – although they remain married.

In Nigeria, Ms Kular’s mother-in-law, Yetunde, said that Rosie now has an as-yet unnamed partner. Yetunde admitted she had concerns about the marriage, which took place in Glenrothes, Fife, in July 2004.

She said: ‘I witnessed the wedding but at first never agreed with it. Omotoso insisted so I had no choice.’

She added she initially liked Ms Kular as she was a ‘well-groomed lady’. But her opinion changed because ‘she liked going to clubs and getting drunk. She always wanted to go out to parties. Omotoso never allowed it – and that’s why she left.’

She said Mr Adekoya, the father of the three eldest children, came to the UK to study. It is understood he now runs a taxi firm. Mikaeel and his twin sister, Ashika, were born in Kirkcaldy in May 2010, after the couple’s separation. But they have had no contact with their Pakistani father.

Ms Kular was brought up in a detached house in an upmarket part of Edinburgh.

Her father Gurbux, who was from India, died aged 43 when she was in her teens. Her mother, Harjinder Kular, 60, is a retired doctor who still lives in a large detached home, with a Jaguar and a Volvo parked in front of the property. She has remarried twice, most recently to Dr Bangarpet Krishnaswamy, 69, a GP originally from Bangalore, who also develops properties in Scotland.

He is the director of East Neuk Healthcare, which owns a 40-bed nursing home in Anstruther, Fife.Yesterday friends said they were shocked that Ms Kular was being questioned – and found it hard to believe that she could harm  any of her children.

One man, who asked not to be named, said: ‘When I was DJ-ing in a club she used to show up every week – but I’ve not seen her out in three or four years.

‘On Facebook a lot of people are asking why others are claiming she’s done this or that.’

The mother-of-five was said to be friends with Mohammed Abdi, who was shot and killed in Edinburgh last year
