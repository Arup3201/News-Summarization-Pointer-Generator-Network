1. Lewis Hamilton -  384 points

2. Nico Rosberg - 317 points 

3. Daniel Ricciardo 238 points  

Lewis Hamilton is King of the Track again. Under the dark sky of Abu Dhabi, fireworks greeted the 29-year-old Stevenage boy turned global superstar as only the fourth Briton to win multiple Formula One world titles.

The fourth in line to another throne, Prince Harry, went to the pit wall to tell Hamilton over the radio: ‘Lewis, thank you very, very much for not making the British public sweat. You are an absolute legend. Well done, mate.’

The team then came on to tell Hamilton he was Mercedes-Benz’s first champion since a chap called Juan Manuel Fangio, in 1955. Fangio was the greatest of them all, but Hamilton is hardly a slouch.

The build-up to the race was tense. Would Hamilton hold on to his lead of 17 points, or would Nico Rosberg spoil his day? But it was, as HRH observed, all in control long before the 55th and concluding lap. So much so that Rosberg, suffering battery problems, was lapped by Hamilton on the penultimate circuit. Hamilton took the victory, with Rosberg 14th, and the title by 67 points.

Double scoring, the great pre-race fear, was immaterial.

And when it was over, Rosberg sought Hamilton out and held him, congratulating a friend who has turned into a bitter rival in the course of a captivating nine months. It was a typically gracious gesture from the vanquished man.

As for Hamilton, his name can be added to Graham Hill, Jim Clark and Sir Jackie Stewart in the pantheon of British double title winners. Six years separate Hamilton’s first and second championships, but now the greatness he promised as a rookie of prodigious gifts has been rewarded as richly as his talent warrants.

The race had been set up perfectly by Rosberg searing to pole position by 0.386sec. Saturday has been the German’s day for most of the year.

But it is Sunday that counts and Hamilton took little more than a blink of an eye to roar into the lead.

Rosberg trundled off the grid. Hamilton powered ahead, swept to his right in front of his colleague and flew through the first left-hand corner. By the time Rosberg came round it, Hamilton was virtually in Dubai. Or another planet. All weekend Hamilton had exhibited tell-tale jitters, given exasperated answers in press conferences and issued false protestations about being cooler than a cucumber in a tumbler of Hendrick’s.

All those worries were dispatched to the file marked ‘i’ for irrelevance in one faultless move.

From that moment, the outcome seemed inevitable. And that is rare with Hamilton, a man who has produced more drama over the years than ITV. Still, how must it have felt for Hamilton’s family who were late, surprise arrivals in Abu Dhabi.

His father Anthony paced up and down, as his wont. His pop-star girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger, step-mother Linda and brother Nic, in a Mercedes top, were all in the garage, their eyes fixed on the timing screens.

But before the sun had set, in the twilight of this dusk-night race, Hamilton had established a comfortable lead. By his first stop, 10 laps in, his advantage was 2.7sec. Rosberg stayed out a lap longer but it did him no good on rubber that was only getting worse.

Rosberg’s engineer Tony Ross came over the radio to explain their remedial strategy: ‘Keep the gap to him (Hamilton) manageable and we’ll go long.’

But within minutes, the German veered off track. That was nothing compared to the problems he was about to suffer with his energy recovery system (ERS). 

‘It’ s failed,’ he said over the radio. That was costing him 160bhp and three seconds a lap. He started to slither down the field.

Hamilton came in for new tyres as his own time was briefly dipping — Scherzinger’s bottom lip quivered — but he only needed to be re-shod. 

He came out and zoomed straight past Rosberg, who had yet to pit again. Both men were totally fair and clean. Hamilton was away.

Now Rosberg had just one chance: namely, to score heavily enough to take the title if Hamilton were to stop. 

‘Just get me into the top five or six as safely as possible,’ he said. Actually, he would have needed fifth to have had a hope in hell.

‘How am I looking?’ he inquired, while lying seventh and fading.

‘Not good at the moment,’ he was told.

‘What the hell does that mean? What do I need to do?’

‘Just drive flat out.’ 

It was truly the most pathetic exchange of the season.

But it was not the last of its sort. ‘Hey guys, what’s going on?’ he asked. ‘The car switched off and now the throttle is all over the place. Get my brake pedal back now please.’ Rosberg was told to retire, but vowed to drive on regardless. Felipe Massa tried hard to catch Hamilton but he had to settle for second, a place ahead of his Williams team-mate Valtteri Bottas.

So the glory went to Hamilton, and who can say he did not deserve it? He is an extraordinary British sportsman at something like the peak of his powers. His 11 wins to Rosberg’s five is a fair reflection of his superiority.

He can be moody. His jewellery is not to everyone’s taste. But there is no denying sheer ability when you are privileged enough to see it. He has also worked hard, carving through the field after the bugler had sounded the Last Post at the end of several qualifying sessions.

A mark of Hamilton’s achievement is that he beat Rosberg, who, through dedication and willpower, made his talent go even further than nature intended.

But, as in their karting days, it ended up with Lewis Hamilton P1, Nico Rosberg P2.
