They've only been in power for a week and Spain's new King Felipe VI and his wife Queen Letizia have barely had time to catch their breath following the coronation as they keep busy with their royal duties.

Today they reviewed Spain's Armed Forces and Guardia Civil during a military ceremony at the Palacio de Oriente (or Royal Palace) in Madrid.

Felipe, 46, a former Olympic yachtsman, and his wife 41-year-old Letizia were proclaimed king and queen on June 19 in a relatively modest ceremony to which no foreign leaders or royals were invited.

Ceremony: The couple have only been in power a week and on Wednesday reviewed the Armed Forces and Guardia Civil

Understated style: The Queen wore a smart stone coloured suit and matching heels

The Queen is a former TV journalist with a wardrobe that gives the Duchess of Cambridge a run for her money. And today she didn't disappoint, wearing a smart but chic outfit befitting the serious occasion.

She wore a stone coloured tweed suit with a lace overlay and a waist clinching belt teamed with colour coordinating heels.

Meanwhile, her husband was in military dress as he gave a speech to the assembled troops.

Earlier this week, the Queen showcased her good taste once again as she joined her husband to attend an audience with the Social Solidarity Association at El Pardo Palace in Madrid.

For that occasion, she wore tailored navy trousers and a tweed blue jacket.

The Queen has been keeping busy, attending two events in two days already this week. 

On Monday, she wore a pretty a floral Hugo Boss dress as she attended the opening of El Greco y La Pintura Moderna exhibition at El Prado museum in Madrid, Spain.

She added some bling to her minimalistic outfit with the help of a pair of dazzling diamond earrings and wore her hair in its trademark sleek style.

The exhibition, which runs until October, marks the IV Centenary of the death of artist El Greco.

It will exhibit 26 pieces of his work and aims to highlight the Cretan painter's work in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

Glow getter: The 41-year-old looked younger than her years with a healthy glow as she attended the art event

On June 19, Felipe was formally proclaimed 
monarch and swore an oath at a ceremony with lawmakers in Parliament. It was a no-frills event, though the 18th-century 
Spanish crown and 17th-century scepter were on display.

After
 a brief military parade, King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia took a
drive through some of Madrid's most emblematic 
streets and monuments - such as the Prado Museum and the Cibeles 
fountain.

The palace 
acknowledged that the customary pomp had been eliminated 'in keeping 
with the criteria of austerity that the times recommend.'

Positively glowing: The Queen was most certainly on trend in her pastel floral dress at today's exhibition opening

Letizia Ortiz, from Asturias in the north
west of Spain, married Prince Felipe de Borbon ten years ago at 
Cathedral Santa María la Real de la Almudena in Madrid.

The
 couple began their relationship in November 2002 when they encountered 
one another while she was on assignment, covering a story about an oil 
spillage in Northern Spain. Felipe – who had met Letizia before at a 
dinner party – was there representing the Spanish royal family, and the 
two started a romantic relationship.

Letizia shops at the supermarket and champions Spanish high street 
fashion brands such as Zara and Mango, as well as couturiers such as Felipe Varela and Lorenzo Caprile.

She regularly tops best-dressed lists in her own country and worldwide.
