Sea monsters may exist only in the imagination, but a Massachusetts couple wants to make them part of their names.

Melanie Ann Convery and Neal James Coughlin of Holyoke, are petitioning the state to allow them to make both of their middle names 'Seamonster.'

The couple has made the request in a legal notice published in a local newspaper as required by state law.

Monster in me: Melanie Ann Convery filed a petition with the Commonwealth requesting that she and her husband, Neal James Coughlin, be allowed to change their names

Identity crisis: He will now be known as Neal James Seamonster Coughlin and his wife, Melanie Seamonster Convery

Official announcement: Massachusetts state law requires any name change to be printed in a local newspaper

A hearing on the request is scheduled for Wednesday in Hampden Probate and Family Court.

Melanie Ann Convery filed a petition with
 the Commonwealth requesting that she and her husband, Neal James 
Coughlin, be allowed to change their names to the following: Melanie 
Seamonster Convery and Neal James Seamonster Coughlin.

The couple gave no indication why they wanted the legendary creatures to be included in their names.

'Despite our crazy/flashy new middle names, my husband and I are pretty private,' Convery said on Twitter.

While objections are allowed, Massachusetts General Laws state, 'The change of name of a person shall be granted unless such change is inconsistent with public interests.'

One person who might object is Mrs Convery's grandmother who spotted the unusual announcement as she was reading every inch of the local newspaper.

'I thought posting our legal name change in the Holyoke Sun might mean no one would read it,' she wrote. 'Turns out grandmas like reading legal notices.'

One can only imagine the conversation that followed as she attempted to explain why she and her quirky husband were changing their name to that of a mythical creature.

A judge will hear the case tomorrow and so long as there are no objections, their new names will become official on August 1st.
