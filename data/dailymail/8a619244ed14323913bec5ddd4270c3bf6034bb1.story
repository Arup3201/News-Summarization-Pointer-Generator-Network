As parents across the country ponder what to do with their children this October half-term, the results of a new study could come as a welcome relief.

The Express reported today that, instead of playing with for expensive toys or gadgets, many children would be much happier indulging in simpler pursuits such as baking, finger painting or carving a Halloween pumpkin.

Many of the activities make up a seasonal list put together by shoemakers Clarks, which commissioned the research.

Alison Sudbury, spokeswomen for the shoe retailers told The Express: 'You don't have to spend a fortune on expensive days out to keep the children entertained this autumn and winter.

'Our list shows that it's the easy and traditional activities that children love to do the most.'

1. Climbing a tree

2. Making a sock puppet

3. Baking a tasty treat

4. Painting a picture

5. Carving a Halloween pumpkin

Clarks have compiled a list entitled 100 Things To Do Before You're Ten, the first part of which was released in the summer.

The list includes many imaginative ideas such as writing a book, pressing flowers and even recording a song.

But more traditional activities still amuse youngsters too, such as climbing a tree, and building a winter garden den for a furry creature.

Playing in the snow, spotting the seasons changing, making a puppet sock and finding a face in a tree also feature.
