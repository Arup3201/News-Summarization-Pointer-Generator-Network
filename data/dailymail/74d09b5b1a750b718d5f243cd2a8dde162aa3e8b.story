The hometown of Sopranos star James Gandolfini honored its most famous son on Sunday by dedicating a road to him by the diner where he spent his youth. 

The actor's 14-year-old son Michael 
said he would never forget eating with his father at the Ridge Diner in New Jersey and that his father always filled him in on local anecdotes.

The teenager, who lives in Los Angeles, told the hundreds who had gathered: 'He just told me every story about every place here.'

Gandolfini's widow Deborah Lin was also at the ceremony in Park Ridge to honor her late husband along with the couple's one-year-old daughter Liliana Ruth.

Gandolfini, best known for his role as Tony Soprano in the hit TV series, died in Rome in June of a heart attack at the age of 51.

Cast
 members Steve Schirripa, Vincent Curatola, Tony Sirico, Dominic 
Chianese, Vincent Pastore and John Ventimiglia were among the hundreds 
of people who turned out in the northern New Jersey town where 
Gandolfini grew up and returned often.

A stretch of Park Avenue in the New Jersey town has been renamed James Gandolfini Way in honor of the actor. The event was inspired by an online protest which was signed by hundreds following the actor's death.

The area is home to the Ridge Diner where Gandolfini often returned having many fond memories of hanging out there on a Friday night with high school friends.
