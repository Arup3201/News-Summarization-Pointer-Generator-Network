Although hole-in-the wall Chinese restaurant Sam Wo was known for its curry noodles among loyal patrons, it was their surly waiter who people really came to see.

The small diner of just eight tables became a cultural mainstay in the 
1970s through reports by the late San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb
 Caen and the Tales of the City novels of Armistead Maupin.

Both men immortalized the restaurant by 
writing about the antics of Edsel Ford Fung, the waiter who was known 
for verbally abusing patrons and slamming dishes on tables.

Sam Wo has been immortalized in San Francisco literature along with its grumpy waiter Edsel Ford Fung. The restaurant closed its doors in 2012

'The Soup Nazi is the Dalai Lama compared
 to Edsel Ford Fung,' said longtime patron Sam Begler, as he tucked into
 pork rolls and chow mein, the Associated Press reported when the restaurant closed its doors in 2012.

'He is the Don Rickles of restaurants.'

Diners of decades past fondly remembered that Mr Fung, who was born and raised in San Francisco's Chinatown, would verbally abuse patrons, slam down dishes, and chastise complainers.

Contrary to Mr Fung's legendary temper, the name of the restaurant actually means 'three in peace'.

The star waiter died in 1984  at age 57, but for a long 
time a sign listing the restaurant's house rules  maintained his gruff 
demeanor.

As head waiter, he would tell customers, who would often queue around the block for a table, to 'sit down and shut up'.

Among its warnings: 'No Booze ... No Jive, No  Coffee, Milk, 
Soft Drinks, Fortune Cookies.'

Fung would refuse to serve 
people  he didn't like the looks of and chastise customers who dared to 
complain when  they were brought the wrong dishes.

Diners who took too long reading the menu were asked: 'What is this, a library?', Priceconomics reported this week. 

Ordering the wrong thing was also a 
problem. A customer who repeatedly, over several decades, tried to get a
 plate of fried shrimp was told 'No! It's a rip-off!'

Other
 unsuspecting diners were forced to take on elements of Mr Fung's job 
description, including cleaning plates, bringing water to other 'guests'
 and totting up the bills.

After earning your seat this way, if a regular came in - then you were often up-ended out of your chair.

The only times that Mr Fung cheered up was when he took part in politically-incorrect 'flirtation'. Often he would grope female customers and told one outraged patron that his teenage daughter had 'nice little apples'.

It was never quite 
clear whether his  crustiness was genuine or an act, but it was always 
an experience, especially  for locals who wandered in to take advantage 
of the restaurant's 3am closing  time.

'I know change is good, but 
sometimes you want to hold onto the happy memories,' said customer 
Darlene Lee at the time, 71, who had been coming to the restaurant for 60 years and 
said its inexpensive fare was comfort food that reminded her of going 
home.

The restaurant closed in 2012 after David Ho, a descendent of one of the restaurant's original owners, decided to shut down after officials demanded extensive health and safety upgrades.

The legendary waiter is remembered fondly by veteran city dwellers every time they pass Gold Mountain - a mural depicting the city's defining traits.

A Chinese restaurant at the San Francisco Giants’ AT&T Park is named after Fung - but the service, although improved, isn't quite a colorful.
