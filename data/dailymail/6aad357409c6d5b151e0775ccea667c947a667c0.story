Former President George W. Bush has said there is a 50-50 chance his brother Jeb will try to run for president.

Brother Jeb, a former Florida governor, is 'wrestling with the decision' of running for the Republican nomination for president in 2016, George W. Bush says.

However he insisted he would be 'all in' for his brother if he decides to run for the office and would do whatever he asks, even if it's to stay behind the scenes.

Family ties: Former President George W. Bush has said there is a 50-50 chance his brother Jeb (pictured together during a campaign rally in Niceville, Florida, will try to run for president 

'I think it's 50-50,' the former president told CBS' 'Face the Nation.' 

'He and I are very close. On the other hand, he's not here knocking on my door, you know, agonizing about the decision. He knows exactly, you know, the ramifications on family, for example. He's seen his dad and his brother go through the presidency. I'd give it a tossup.'

The former president was more conservative in his estimate than another family member. Jeb Bush's son George P. Bush said two weeks ago it was more likely than not that the former Florida governor would move forward.

George W. Bush is promoting '41,' a book about his father, former President George H.W. Bush.

'One of the lessons you learn from George H.W. Bush is that you can go into politics and still be a good father,' George W. Bush said when asked if it's worth putting a family through a presidential campaign. 'I put our family through it,' he responded.

As for their mother's position that enough Bushes have run for president, he said, 'Sometimes her prognostications haven't been very accurate.'

The younger Bush preceded Barack Obama in America's highest office, and saw his Pentagon's hard-fought gains in the region reversed by troop pullouts from both Afghanistan and Iraq.  

Support: George W. Bush said he would be 'all in' for his brother if he decides to run for the office and would do whatever he asks, even if it's to stay behind the scenes 

During the interview he also said that he has no regrets about sending American servicemen and women to the Middle East for the conflict. 

GOP operatives and donors have reported that Bush is beginning to signal stronger interest in a presidential run, although some suggest he needs to act relatively quickly. 

'If he waits too long he'll start to lose his advantages, the built-in network,' Republican strategist and former Minnesota Rep. Vin Weber said. 'Those people are not going to wait forever.' 

Twice over the last six years Florida voted for U.S. President Barack Obama, and political observers warned against reading too much into the Republican Party's win on Tuesday when looking ahead to the 2016 presidential elections.
