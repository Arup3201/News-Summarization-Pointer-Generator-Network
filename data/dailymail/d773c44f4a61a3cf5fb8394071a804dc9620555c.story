The outspoken juror from George Zimmerman's murder trial who tried to get a book deal out of her experience says she wants her 'normal life' back.

'No other family should be forced to endure what the Martin family has endured,' the juror, known only as Juror B37, said in a statement to CNN. 'My prayers are with Travon's parents for 
their loss, as they have always been. I now wish for me and my family to
 recover from being selected for this jury and return to a normal life.'

Public outrage ensued as news emerged this week that Juror B37 was considering a book deal based on her trial experience. An interview that she gave to Anderson Cooper also caused a stir.

She addressed the deal in her statement, saying, 'As for the alleged "book deal," there is not one at this time.

Inside the courtroom: The unidentified juror said that she felt Zimmerman was justified in killing Trayvon Martin because he felt threatened, even though she admits Zimmerman may have 'enhanced' the story

'There was an agreement with a 
literary agent to explore the concept of a book which discussed the 
impact of sequestration on my perceptions of this serious case, while 
being compared to the perceptions of an attorney who was closely 
following the trial from outside the "bubble,"' she added. 'The 
relationship with the agent ceased the moment I realized what had been 
occurring in the world during the weeks of my sequestration.'

Juror B37 made the statements after four other jurors released a statement distancing themselves from her.

'The
 opinions of Juror B37, expressed on the Anderson Cooper show were her 
own, and not in any way representative of the jurors listed below,' they
 said in the statement released Tuesday night.

In
 an effort to maintain their privacy, the four women identified 
themselves only as B51, B76, E6 and E40. One juror - B29- did not sign 
the document.

'Serving on this jury has been a highly emotional and physically draining experience for each of us,' the statement read.

'Everyone deserves a fair trial,' she said.E-6 is a white woman who is married and has two children. She has worked in financial services and has lived in Seminole County for two years.

During jury selection, she said she had been the victim of a nonviolent crime.THE ONE REMAININGB-29 recently moved to central Florida from Chicago. She enjoys watching the 'Real Housewives' on television and hadn’t paid much attention to the shooting. A prosecutor described her as 'black or Hispanic' during jury selection.

'The death of a teenager weighed heavily on our hearts but in the end we did what the law required us to do.'

Even though they backed away from juror B37's claims, all six of the women had to agree on the not guilty verdict before it was announced on Saturday night.

One of her most controversial claims in the Anderson Cooper interview was that Martin 'played a huge role in his death'.

'When George confronted him he could have walked away and gone home,' the woman, identified only as Juror B37, said in the second portion of her post-trial interview.

While she was apologetic to the teenager's family, she seemed more sympathetic to Zimmerman's position in the midst of the fight, as opposed to Martin's own self defense.

'I have no doubt that George feared for his life,' she said to CNN's Anderson Cooper.

'I'm 101% that he should have done 
what he did except for the things that he did before,' she said, 
referencing Zimmerman's decision to follow the teenager in his car and, 
fatefully, get out of the car and confront him.

'When the end came to the end, he was justified in shooting Trayvon Martin.

'He
 started the ball rolling, he could have avoided the whole situation by 
staying in the car, but he wanted to do good- he had good in his heart, 
he just went overboard.'

While
 Zimmerman himself never took the stand in his own defense, video 
recordings of him explaining the situation to police after the fatal 
shooting were submitted, effectively giving him the chance to tell his 
side without leaving himself open to a cross examination.

Cleared: The juror said that she felt that Zimmerman went above the bounds of what he should have done but 'his heart was in the right place'

Their side: Gladys and Robert Zimmerman spoke out for the first time in an interview taped on Monday, saying that they fear for their son's life

That was no matter for the juror: I'm 
sure there were some fabrications, enhancements, but I think pretty much
 it happened how he said it happened.'

Initially
 this unidentified female juror was planning on writing a book about her
 experience on the trial- and even had a literary agent lined up early 
Monday afternoon- but after the first portion of her interview was aired
 that evening she and the agent decided not to follow up.

The second portion of B37's interview was
 aired on Tuesday, and she went into more detail about how two specific 
tact used by the prosecution may have influenced the outcome.

Breaking out in riots: Protests throughout the country, including in Los Angeles (pictured Monday)

Mayhem: A group of protestors try to tear down a fence in Los Angeles where the demonstrations turned violent on Monday night and many were arrested

Throughout her interview with Cooper, 
the woman regularly referred to the neighborhood watchman as George, and
 though she did call the 17-year-old Trayvon, she admitted that she felt
 more personally connected to Zimmerman as opposed to Martin.

'Trayvon wasn’t as well known to us because there wasn't as much said about him,' she said.

Cooper
 brought up the fact that the two legal teams took very different visual
 approaches when making their closing arguments, with the defense 
holding up a concrete block like a portion of the sidewalk to show what 
they contend Martin used to attack. On the opposite end, the prosecution
 held up the Arizona Iced Tea bottle and a bag of Skittles, saying that 
was the only thing he was armed with.

'The Skittles and the Arizona can were ridiculous to even compare it to,' she said.

Martin's materials: Assistant state attorney Bernie de la Rionda held up the Skittles and Iced Tea that Trayvon had on him at the time of his death, saying that was all he was armed with

Hard hitting: By contrast, defense attorney Mark O'Mara held up a piece of the concrete sidewalk that he argued Martin used to bash Zimmerman's head

'I believe he hit his head on the concrete, I believe he was trying to slam it...it was definitely enough to make you fear

'I hope (Zimmerman's) family can live a normal life after a while. I don't know how he's ever going to do that.'

Yesterday
 it was revealed that the first vote that the six-woman jury took behind
 closed doors came as a draw, with three wanting to acquit, one ready to
 charge him with second degree murder and two for manslaughter.

In
 today's segment, she made it clear that after hours of discussing the 
case and the evidence, the group had shifted to be five in favor of 
acquittal with one hold out.

'I wanted to find him guilty of not using his senses...you can't charge him with anything because he didn't do anything unlawful,' she said.

Juror B37 went on to sob while saying that she wanted to apologize to the Martin family for the tragedy that they had to go through, but she also had a message for George Zimmerman and his family- after it was revealed yesterday that his parents have been in hiding as well as the former neighborhood watchman and his wife.

'I hope his family can live a normal life after a while. I don't know how hes ever going to do that. He'll never forget but I hope he can,' she said. 

Her interview aired just minutes before four of the remaining five jurors put out a statement saying that they want to remain anonymous and are formally requesting privacy.
