A driver on the northbound Freeway 55 in Orange County, California noticed another driver going extremely slowly and hitting the side walls of the highway.

The vehicle was quickly pulled over by a police officer, and what fellow drivers on the road witnessed once the man opened his door was almost certainly one of the worst drinking and driving episodes that southern California has ever seen. 

The officer had no need to use a breathalyzer in this case. 

Police were called on the northbound Freeway 55 to assist a driver who was hitting the highway sidewalls

The man was so intoxicated, he couldn’t even stay standing up as he emerged from the vehicle.

The police officer pulled the man by his arms to the freeway's shoulder, yelling at him to get up.

After several failed attempts, the man manages to regain his footing - only to stumble again and be forced to grab the side rail for support.

Once pulled over, the man was so intoxicated, he was unable to even stand next to his vehicle

The officer dragged the man from his car by his arms, before watching him stumble onto the shoulder

The men in the vehicle behind them recorded the entire incident, offering shocked, incredulous commentary

The men in the car beside the incident watch the unbelievable situation unfold, offering commentary to each other along the way.

'He can't even stand up!' one of them is heard shouting off-camera.
