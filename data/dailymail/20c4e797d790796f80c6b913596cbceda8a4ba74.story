A passerby who captured an intimate proposal at New York's Rockefeller Center ice rink on Monday night is desperately trying to find the couple and has taken to social media sites to ask people to help him.

The Reddit user, named JohnnyThunders, posted the picture on Tuesday of the romantic moment which shows the man on one knee holding the hand of his beloved as he slips on her ring - both still wearing their skates.

The photographer posted the picture on New York City's subreddit in the hopes the couple could be found, so he can give them a copy.

Romantic moment: The intimate proposal at New York's Rockefeller Center ice rink on Monday has kick started a manhunt in the city to find the couple in the picture

'I know these engagements happen all the time, but I was surprised to be at such a nice viewpoint. Iâ€™d really love for them to have this,' he wrote on Reddit.

His post generated more than 100 responses, but none of which can prove they have found the right couple.

One person claimed he knew the couple, but the pictures did not match up.

Another user, DumplingDarling, said: 'Don't worry -- they got the picture. You have to pay to get engaged on the ice at Rock Center.'

Another proposal: One person claimed he knew the couple, saying they were his friends who also got engaged the same night. But the pictures did not match up

Yours for a moment: The Rockefeller Center has special engagement packages giving couples 'exclusive' time on the ice to pop the question in private

Indeed, it is true. The Rockefeller Center has special engagement packages, which allows the couple 'exclusive' time on the ice to pop the question in private.

The packages range from costing $350 for the 'Silver Package' to a whopping $1,000 for a 'Platinum Package', the latter which includes a bottle of champagne, roses and a five-course meal for two.
