Wimbledon champion Andy Murray joked about his position as 'No 2 son' after he scored a Centre Court win and mum Judy chose to watch brother Jamie play doubles.

The Scot was pleased Jamie and Australian John Peers had won their doubles match, but jokingly rued his lack of family support.

Murray raced to a 6-2 6-3 6-2 win over 27th-seeded Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut to secure his place in the fourth round, coming through the first week of the tournament without dropping a set.

Choices: Mum Judy popped in to watch the closing stages of Andy's match having seen Jamie win

He faces big-serving South African Kevin Anderson in his next assignment, and may need all the backing he can find if his opponent is at his very best.

He will hope Wimbledon keep his match and any doubles clash former Wimbledon mixed doubles champion Jamie may have on Monday at different times of day.

After his early-evening win on Friday, Murray was told of Jamie's victory and said: 'It's a shame we're on at the same time.

'None of my family came to watch me so I'm obviously the number two son.

'My brother's the priority - he's No 1 son - he's always had the preference since I've been a kid, but it's good that we both won.'

Watching on: Murray did at least have girlfriend Kim Sears to cheer him on on Centre Court

Judy did arrive in the late stages to see her younger son complete his handsome victory, but Murray appeared not to have spotted her in the crowd.

Speaking on the BBC, Murray said of his latest win: 'It's good to get it done in straight sets.

'He's the best opponent I've played. He's obviously seeded and coming in with confidence from winning a tournament last week.

'It was a step up. There were a few things I could have done better but it's been a good first week. Now I can rest up and be fresh for Monday.'

Looking ahead to the tussle with Anderson, who at the age of 28 has reached a career-high 18th place in the world rankings, Murray said: 'He's a tough opponent. He's made improvements this year.

He's a big guy with a big game. I'll have to return well if I want to win.'
