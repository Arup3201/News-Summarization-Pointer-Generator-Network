Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne has criticised customers at his own chain of health clubs and says lowering prices at his gyms has attracted the wrong sort of clientele.

The multi-millionaire businessman said reducing the cost of membership at his Bannatyne's Health Clubs chain has led to an increase in 'problem customers'. 

Bannatyne, 64, who owns the UK's largest independent chain of health clubs, said lowering the price felt like 'devaluing' the brand but that he had to do it because he faced losing money.

The Dragons' Den star (pictured left with Hilary Devey, Theo Paphitis, Deborah Meaden and Peter Jones) has been accused of having a 'Ratner moment' for criticising his customers

The wrong class of people: Bannatyne said that 'once you lower your thresholds, you start to attract more of the kinds of customers who create problems'

However, the business tycoon said that he 
had heard reports that new members were creating problems for staff, and
that the atmosphere within the gyms had changed as a result.

He said his son-in-law Anthony, who runs one of the clubs, said they are attracting a different kind of customer since dropping the prices.

He told Scotland on Sunday: 'More
and more, people are trying it on, trying to sneak in a friend without 
paying or making complaints in the hope of getting money back.

'Once you lower your thresholds, you start to attract more of the kinds of customers who create problems and take up staff time.'

Monthly memberships at his gym chain were recently cut from £42 to £29 to try and attract new customers.

Bannatyne told the newspaper the business was not 'in last chance saloon' but that slashing prices was a gamble.

And even owning the company has not prevented him from uncomfortable encounters.

He said he was 'intimidated' when he met two Russian bodybuilders who did not speak English at his Manchester branch and said older members would feel intimidated too.

His comments were criticised by publicist Max Clifford, who compared him to jeweller Gerald Ratner.

Ratner's business plummeted in value in 1991 after he called one of his products 'total crap.'

Mr Clifford told The Independent: 'For someone to be criticising the people that are paying him, as Gerald Ratner found out years ago, is the last thing you should be doing.'

Bannatyne has written about his recent business woes and divorce from wife Joanne in his autobiography, Riding The Storm, which was serialised in the Daily Mail.

He lost £345million from his fortune and his spot in The Rich List over two years.

Matt Barnett, Barclays chief executive

In 2003 Barnett shocked a panel of MPs, and the general public, but suggesting that he wouldn't use one of his own company's Barclaycard products because it was too expensive. He said: 'I do not borrow on credit cards. I have four young children. I give them advice not to pile up debts on their credit cards.'

David Shepherd, Topman brand director:

Calling your own customers 'hooligans' probably isn't the best way to win their loyalty, but in 2001 that was who the Topman brand director said his clothes were for. Asked to elaborate, he went on to say: 'Very few of our customers have to wear suits for work. They'll be for his first interview or first court case.' When challenged on the remarks, he said that 'hooligan' probably wasn't offensive to his clientele.

Winston Cigarettes executive:

In an interview with the New York Times, cigarette model and so-called 'Winston man' David Goerliz revealed that during one photo shoot he asked for a free packet of cigarettes from the many strewn around. When he was told to take them all, Goerlitz asked if anyone else there smoked. An executive responded: 'Are you kidding? We reserve that right for the poor, the young, the black and the stupid.'

John Pluthero, UK chairman Cable & Wireless:

In a reverse-Ratner, one chairman managed to offend his staff rather than his customers. In 2006 John Pluthero sent a morale-boosting memo to staff which read: 'Congratulations, we work for an underperforming business in a crappy industry and it's going to be hell for the next 12 months.'

He warned of job losses before adding: 'If you are worried that it all sounds very hard, it's time for you to step off the bus.'
