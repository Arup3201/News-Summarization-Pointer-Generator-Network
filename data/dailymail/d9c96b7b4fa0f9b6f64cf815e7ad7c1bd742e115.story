A Siberian has town found itself, quite literally, frozen to the core, after its water main burst amid an ice cold storm.

The storm had burst several waterpipes in the town, and with temperatures dropping to -40C during the night, the water froze solid in the street.

Dudinka is a small town of 22,000 residents in Krasnoyarsk Krai, a large territory in the middle of Siberia that borders the Arctic Ocean.

As with many residential areas in Siberia, hot water is provided to apartment blocks from a power plant where it is centrally heated and then piped into the homes. 

Although many homes were left without water and electricity, internet connections were as solid as the ice in the streets, and Dudinka residents shared images of their plight on social media. 

Local government spokesman Eugene Gerasimov said: 'Anybody in doubt of exactly how cold it is here just need to look at the pictures.

'Even the hot water pipes were freezing, and the water that flooded out quickly formed into a solid block.'

Several images show vehicles encased in 4ft-thick ice from the frozen water mains, and others show massive icicles clinging to the outsides of apartment complexes.

Mr Gerasimov said officials had declared a state of emergency.
