Iraqi intelligence officers are investigating the assassination of a British engineer and his family in the French Alps, including his links to Saddam Hussein and an alleged fortune in cash hidden in a Swiss bank account.

Saad al-Hilli, 50, wife Ikbal, 47, and her mother Suhaila, 74, were gunned down in their car execution-style while seemingly taking a camping holiday in the Alps.

Oldest daughter Zainab, seven, was shot in the shoulder, while Zeena, four, only survived by hiding underneath her mother’s skirt in the back of the family's BMW estate car.

But as yet investigations have drawn a
blank prompting the French team to travel to Iraq to hand dozens of pages on Mr al-Hilli 
to local Intelligence officers in the hope they can uncover a motive for the killings.

Mr al-Hilli returned to Iraq in 2010, 
ostensibly to take control of the family home and a poultry business they
managed before leaving the country in the late 1960s.

But during his time there he was allegedly badly beaten up and was said to have returned to the UK traumatised from the experience.     

Then there is also the question of an estimated £800,000 left by Saad’s father Kadhim in a Swiss bank account.

There have been reports that  his late
father, Kadhim, was once close to Saddam's Ba'ath Party  but fell foul 
of the tyrant in the Seventies, and fled Iraq for Britain.

Alternatively, it has been suggested 
this was a smokescreen and that Kadhim's true role was to manage secret 
accounts for the regime.

Emails and mobile phone calls 
intercepted by Swiss intelligence agency FIS and passed to their German 
counterparts suggest that Saad Al-Hilli may have been about to access 
the money, or part of it, shortly before he was killed.

Lake Annecy, where the family were staying is a short drive to the Swiss border and over to Geneva.

Another account, said to contain some 
£16 million in illegal kickbacks to Saddam Hussein's regime, was set up 
in the tax haven of Liechtenstein.

This was one of dozens of accounts the Saddam regime used to hide money illegally skkimmed from the UN Oil for Food programme.

While sketchy, the claims raise 
questions about whether the killers knew or suspected Mr Al-Hilli had 
access to large deposits of cash.

A source told the Daily Mirror: 'For 
this murder to take place just over the Swiss border, so close to where 
that money rested untouched for so many years, cannot be disregarded as a
strange coincidence,” the inquiry source continued.

'In total there are more than 2,000 dossiers to study, many focussing on the family’s Iraqi background.

'That is why this is such an extraordinarily complex case and why it could take years of careful police work to solve it.'

An earlier theory maintained that the 
cyclist Mr Mollier, 45, was in fact the intended target due to his job 
at a metal plant supplying materials to the nuclear fuel industry

There had been some speculation that 
the Israeli secret service Mossad believed Mr Mollier could have been 
selling nuclear secrets and was monitoring his emails.

Another theory is that the killings were the work of a racist psychopath who had targetted the family at random.
