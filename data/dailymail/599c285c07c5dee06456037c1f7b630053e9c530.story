Joe Kinnear has attacked Newcastle legend Alan Shearer for criticising his appointment as the club’s director of football, saying the former England striker ‘hasn’t got a clue about coaching’.

Shearer, who failed to save Newcastle from relegation in 2009 as caretaker manager while Kinnear recovered from heart surgery, said last week the 66-year-old’s return has undermined manager Alan Pardew and turned the club into a ‘laughing stock’.

Kinnear told The Sunday Times: ‘What Shearer says is diabolical. This is a guy who hasn’t got a clue about coaching.

Defence: Newcastle's new director of football Joe Kinnear came out swinging in a Sunday Times interview

‘The last game of the season, he came up 
with the master idea of playing Damien Duff at left back. Damien is one 
of the best left wingers around but can’t tackle. And we went down with 
an own goal from Damien. Shearer keeps slagging me off. He is being 
disrespectful. I’m entitled to fight back.’

Kinnear has been ridiculed over a radio interview with talkSPORT in 
which he mispronounced the names of players, referring to Yohan Cabaye 
as ‘Yohan Kebab’.

He claimed he had been duped into thinking 
he would be reminiscing with co-host Bobby Gould about their days at 
Wimbledon rather than discussing Newcastle with presenter Andy 
Goldstein.

Rubbish: Kinnear labelled Shearer's comments 'diabolical' and said he 'hasn't got a clue' about coaching

‘I did it as a favour and I’m so disappointed,’ said Kinnear.

‘I was on 
air and he switched me to the other presenter. I thought I was going to 
speak to Bobby about the old days. Yohan is a brilliant player and I 
didn’t pronounce his name right. But I didn’t say “Kebab”. I said 
“Keba”; they put the ‘b’ on it. They made a meal of it, no pun 
intended.’

Stitched up? Kinnear says he thought he was going to talk to Bobby Gould about the good old days

Owner Mike Ashley’s decision to bring Kinnear back has put a question 
mark over Pardew, but Kinnear said: ‘I am not after his job. Alan knew 
there was a director of  football coming in. He felt a little isolated; 
Mike sussed that.

‘If things are going wrong at the club, I am accountable and he will be coming through me, not anybody else.

‘Everybody thinks Pardew is under  pressure. He’s not. I am. I could get sacked.’
