Manchester United have agreed to sell Chile striker Angelo Henriquez to Dinamo Zagreb for a fee in the region of £1million.

Henriquez cost £4m when he moved to Old Trafford in the summer of 2012 from Universidad de Chile but never played a competitive game for United, scoring once in a pre-season friendly against Swedish club AIK a year later.

He went out on loan to Wigan Athletic and Real Zaragoza before making a season-long move to Zagreb where he has scored 10 goals so far this season.

The deal included an option for the Croatian side to sign Henriquez permanently in the summer, and coach Zoran Mamic confirmed that terms have now been agreed.

With so many star names in Louis van Gaal’s squad, Henriquez had already indicated that his future would probably lie away from Old Trafford.

‘We have bought him outright,’ said Mamic. ‘Taking Henriquez depends on us, not on Manchester United. We took him with the right of first refusal, which stands at around €1.5m (£1.1m), and we have already signed a contract with him for the summer. There is no longer any doubt – he is ours and the story is resolved.'
