The Duchess of Cornwall's brother left nothing from his £900,000 estate to his ‘secret’ girlfriend after he died without writing a will, it has been revealed.

Mark Shand died unexpectedly in April aged 62 after falling and hitting his head on a pavement in New York.

But as he had no will, the sole beneficiary was his daughter Ayesha, 19, from his former marriage to French actress Clio Goldsmith, the niece of billionaire Sir James Goldsmith.

Inheritance laws mean that nothing was inherited by Ruth Powys, 36, who became his on-off girlfriend after his divorce in 2009.

Miss Powys, the CEO of Shand's charity Elephant Family, stated after his death that they were no longer in a relationship, but were still 'full of love for each other'.

Some commentators claimed that the couple had been 'unofficially engaged'.

Shand had his fatal fall while in New York to host a Sotheby's auction of egg sculptures decorated by leading artists in aid of his charity and underprivileged children.

The Duchess of Cornwall described her brother as 'charismatic with a devil-may-care attitude to life'

The event, attended by Princess Eugenie, raised nearly £1million, and was followed by an after-party at the exclusive Diamond Horseshoe club off Times Square.

He reportedly stepped out for a cigarette after leaving the Rose Bar of the Gramercy Park Hotel, tripped and fell backwards as he tried to re-enter through a revolving door.

The conservationist was taken to the nearby Bellevue Hospital and put on a life support machine, but died from his head injuries around nine hours later.

Miss Powys, an advocate for human rights, revealed that she was at his hospital bedside and had her 'hand on his heart'.

In a moving interview after his death, she added: 'Mark was my everything, my inspiration in life, he gave me everything I have, he's everywhere I look.

'We had been together off and on for many years after Mark was divorced, we were not together at this moment.

'I had moved to New York to try and separate myself from him, but we had the deepest love, we were full of love for each other.

'Our relationship was low key, we had a shared passion for elephants, we had the same spirit. We were trying to separate, it was such a difficult thing to do - to try and move on, he wanted me to find someone my own age.'

Six weeks before his death, he dismissed reports linking him to Strictly Come Dancing star Nancy Dell'Olio, the former girlfriend of ex-England football manager Sven Goran Eriksson. 

He admitted knowing Nancy through his charity work, but said he would be 'more likely to have an affair with a ripe pomegranate'. 

Records released last week reveal that the former playboy left £1,579,227 reduced after liabilities to a net estate of £926,543. 

Camilla who was extremely close to her only brother, has hinted at his careless attitude to personal finance

Camilla, 67, who was extremely close to her only brother, hinted at his careless attitude to personal finance in a tribute to him before his memorial service last month.

She described him as 'my charismatic and sometimes infuriating brother' and 'a golden boy, blessed with good looks, charm and a devil-may-care attitude to life'. 

Shand was a regular at the famously decadent New York nightclub Studio 54 and dated a string of beautiful women including President John Kennedy's daughter Caroline, Bianca Jagger and supermodel Marie Helvin.

He bought a neglected elephant called Tara in India in 1988 and rode her 800 miles from the Bay of Bengal to Patna on the Ganges. His subsequent book Travels on My Elephant became a best seller.
