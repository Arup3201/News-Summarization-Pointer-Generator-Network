Arsene Wenger said Arsenal will be 'very active' before the transfer deadline as they continue their hunt for new players.

The Gunners lost out on Loic Remy, who moved to Chelsea, and after a disappointing 1-1 draw at Leicester, Wenger's hunt for a striker is likely to intensify.

The 64-year-old told Sky: 'Look, the decision is not to make but to find the personnel - that's the problem. We are open (to new signings) and we work on it. We are very active.'

With Olivier Giroud out with a fractured ankle until 2015, Wenger knows that unless he signs a new forward, the club might have to forget about their title ambitions. 

The Gunners boss claimed that he was ready to spend, but would not be forced into doing anything rash.

He said: 'The pressure to buy is always there. We want to (buy) and we will work at it but let's not fool ourselves - it's not because you buy just one player that you win games.' 

Arsenal's manager was disappointed to only come away with a draw but the Frenchman admitted that it was a fair result.

He said: 'We were a bit unlucky with the injury to (Laurent) Koscielny and after that the draw was a fair result. We did not create enough and they worked very hard. 

'We missed a few opportunities maybe but I felt we lacked a little bit creativity and sharpness.

'We had two tough weeks with three away games - the Champions League was very demanding. It's not an excuse but we were a bit jaded.' 

Striker: Arsenal fans will be hoping that Arsene Wenger can find a suitable substitute for Olivier Giroud as Yaya Sanogo's performances have been unconvincing

Injury: Arsenal will be without Olivier Giroud until 2015 after he fractured his ankle against Everton, leaving the Gunners with just one genuine centre-forward

Tempers: The frustration of Arsenal's players was evident as they failed to build on their early goal and tempers flared close to the end of the match

Alexis Sanchez opened the scoring for the Gunners as he swept home Yaya Sanogo's cross.

But Nigel Pearson's side weren't behind for long. A swift counter attack ended when Jeff Schlupp's pin-point cross was met by Leonardo Ulloa, who guided his header past Wojciech Szczesny. 

Arsene Wenger's side pressed for a winner but in truth Leicester had the better chances and could have won the game.

Arsenal's manager said: 'We wanted so much to win that we lost any caution; we were more open to counter attacks and in the end we could have lost.'

Meanwhile, Leicester captain Wes Morgan said: 'That (draw) was the least we deserved. We created quite a few chances - that was the least we deserved today.

'Obviously everyone knows how good Arsenal are and we worked hard to limit their chances. People know Leicester is a team they can't take lightly.'

Close: Wojciech Szczesny makes an excellent save to deny Jamie Vardy from scoring a late winner, the Foxes looked a real threat when counter-attacking

Tough: Arsenal have now played their last three Premier League matches away from home - travelling to Crystal Palace, Everton and Leicester

Struggle: Arsenal's performances have been laboured and lacking in fluency so far this season and players like Mesut Ozil do not look fit
