For more than 50 years Chicago has transformed its river into a bright emerald green in honor of St Patrick's day.

Now an amazing 30-second-long timelapse video shows step-by-step how the incredible transformation takes place.

From the aerial footage, a speedboat can be seen whizzing up and down the river over the course of an hour while dumping containers of a green vegetable dye into the water.

The first drop of green: A speedboat begins dumping a harmless orange vegetable dye into the Chicago River

Quick work: The speed boat whizzes up and down the river, dropping dye as it goes

Second time round: As the boat begins its second trip up the river, the green dye starts to spread

The boat has to complete five round trips of the river to drop enough dye to turn it green

Nearly there: While the water colour starts to look a bit toxic, the dye is completely harmless

The transformation is complete: After the boat has completed its fifth trip, the river has turned a bright green, just in time for the city's parade

While the dye starts off as a single green streak in the dark murky water, it quickly spreads, turning the entire river a shocking bright green.

The hue typically lasts about six to 12 hours and is prepped right before the city's big St Patrick's Day parade, which was held on Saturday this year.

The tradition of turning the river green has its origins in the city's efforts to detect illegal sewage dumping back in 1962.

Plumbers would use fluorescein dye along the river, which would turn bright green if toxic sludge was detected.

It's beginning to look a lot like St Patrick's Day: The Chicago River gets its first doses of green dye on Saturday March 15

The city that bleeds green: The grassy hues begin to overtake the river

The dyeing of the river is still 
sponsored by the local plumbers union, but now they use a harmless 
orange vegetable dye to get the desired hue.

The exact formula is a closely guarded secret, but it has been tested and is safe for the environment.

On
 Saturday, thousands of cheering onlookers clustered along downtown 
bridges as members of Chicago Journeymen Plumbers Union Local 130 began 
dumping containers of dye into the river from motorboats Saturday 
morning.

The annual tradition began at 9:30 a.m. and immediately precedes the St. Patrick's Day parade.

Organizers had feared that large chunks of ice would impede the process, but recent warm temperatures kept the river clear.
