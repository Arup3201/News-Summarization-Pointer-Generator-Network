Guilty: Alba Gonzalez Camacho was given a one-year suspended sentence for inciting violence on Twitter

A Spanish woman has become the first person in the country's history to be convicted for inciting terrorism through Twitter.

Alba Gonzalez Camacho, 21, was given a one-year suspended sentence for using the social network to call for a defunct left wing terrorist group to reform and kill senior politicians.

The student, from Jaen in Andalusia, had offered to tattoo herself with the face of anyone who shoots Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and senior minister Luis De Guindos, while also calling for the reformation of GRAPO - communist terrorists who killed more than 80 people in the 1970s and 80s.

Gonzalez Camacho's terrorism conviction is the first of its kind involving Twitter posts in Spain, with the judge at the National Court in Madrid agreeing with the prosecution's argument that she had posted 'messages with an ideological content that was highly radicalized and violent'.

Although she was sentenced to a year in prison, she was given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to posting the tweets, meaning she will not go to prison unless she commits another crime.

Gonzalez Camacho has also been disqualified from holding public office for the next seven years.

Although she never previously been in trouble with the law, the student social worker describes herself on Twitter as a 'subversive... with a heart darker than night but a soul red like blood.'

Still active on the social network using the handle @albacorazonegro, her page features images of Che Guevara and a Soviet flag.

One tweet under scrutiny from July 2012 read, 'The PP [governing Popular Party] taught me that there is still a great need for the GRAPO.'

Other tweets called for violence against members of the PP, with one reading: 'I promise to tattoo myself with the face of the person who shoots Rajoy in the neck and also shoots one in De Guindos. #RajoyCoward #rescue'.

Gonzalez Camacho has reportedly refused to be interviewed over the trial, saying the case has already brought her family enough trouble, but the New York Times claims to have had an email exchange with her in which she described herself as a 'normal girl'.

The newspaper claims she added that the intention of her Twitter posts was to fight 'a system in which a minority lives on the back of the death, misery and exploitation of a majority' in a country where the euro crisis has caused widespread economic despair.

'The truth is that I’m a very normal girl, who has never landed herself in any kind of problem... But if I tell you everything that I’m fed up with, I would never stop,' she added.

'I never imagined something like that could happen to me because you find a lot of nonsense on the Internet, including worse than mine... But it seems that here that the prosecution is only for those from one side - the Fascists can say whatever they want, and nothing will ever happen to them,' she said.

The conviction comes after conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy began exploring the possibility of increasing restrictions on public protests in Spain.

Alba Gonzalez Camacho sent this tweet, which translates as: 'I promise to tattoo myself with the face of the person who shoots Rajoy in the neck and also shoots one in De Guindos. #RajoyCoward #rescue'

In November he agreed a controversial bill to make it a criminal offence to use the internet to organise a protest that turns violent, which has since led to criticism that the legislation has been used to unfairly target left-wing groups, despite a growing number of far-right protests in the country.

The history of terrorism in Spain is dominated by far-left and separatist organisations, which emerged under the brutal Fascist Franco dictatorship that ended in 1975.

The country's worst ever attack came in 2004, however, when a group of Islamists killed 191 people in a bombing at the Atocha train station in Madrid.

GRAPO, often referred to in English as the First of October Anti-Fascist Resistance Group, emerged in 1976, with its violent acts leading to the deaths of more than 80 people in the first decade of its existence. 

Its last known victim was a businesswoman killed in a botched kidnapping in 2006.

Although the group has never formally disbanded, the death of its historical leader in 2001 and the conviction 24 members in 2007 are believed to have led to an effective break up.
