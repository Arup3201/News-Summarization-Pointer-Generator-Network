A New York City rookie officer has been charged with manslaughter, official misconduct and other charges in the accidental shooting death of a man in a darkened stairwell of a Brooklyn public housing complex.

Officer Peter Liang pleaded not guilty Wednesday in the November death of 28-year-old Akai Gurley. He was released without bail. The Brooklyn courtroom was packed with officers.

Liang and his partner were patrolling the Louis Pink Houses, a public housing complex where reports of violent crime had spiked. The hallways were pitch black, and Liang had his gun drawn. Police said it appeared he accidentally fired a shot. Gurley had been waiting for an elevator. When it didn't come, he stepped into the hallway to take the stairs and was one floor above when he was struck.

Liang looked somber as he entered court on Wednesday, one day after a grand jury indicted him for the November incident

Earlier Wednesday, NYPD officer Peter Liang arrived at the 84th  Precinct for booking  in a black van, which was parked outside the building in an attempt to shield the cop from reporters and photographers.

Dressed in a black suit, he was silent as he entered the station where he will be booked before appearing later today in court for his arraignment. 

A Brooklyn grand jury heard the case against Liang for just a few days before they decided to issue an indictment on Tuesday. 

Justice: Unarmed father-of-one, Akai Gurley (pictured) was shot dead by Liang in November. His death was one of a series of deaths involving black men at the hands of police which sparked angry protests across the United States last year

The indictment comes after mass protests and calls for reform of the grand jury system nationwide following a Staten Island grand jury's refusal to indict a police officer in the chokehold death of Eric Garner and a Missouri grand jury's decision not to indict an officer in the death of Michael Brown.

The November death of Gurley, 28, was ruled a 'homicide' by the Medical Examiner's office - just as Eric Garner's was. 

Rynecki said the shooting was unjustified, regardless of whether it was intentional.

'This is the first step for justice,' he said.

Asian-American Liang and his partner were patrolling the Louis Pink Houses, a public housing development in Brooklyn's gritty East New York neighborhood, on November 20.

The New York Police Department assigns rookie officers as reinforcements in parts of the city that have seen increases in crime. 

The housing project, where Gurley's friend lives, had been the scene of a recent shooting, robberies and assaults.

The officers had descended onto an eighth-floor landing when, 14 steps away, Gurley and the woman who had been braiding his hair opened a door into the seventh-floor landing after giving up their wait for the elevator so he could head to the lobby. 

The lights were burned out in the stairwell, leaving it 'pitch black' and prompting both officers to use flashlights, police said after the shooting.

Liang, for reasons unclear, also had his gun drawn, police said. He was about 10 feet from Gurley when, without a word and apparently by accident, he fired a shot, police said.

Gurley was struck in the chest. The two made it down two flights of stairs after he was shot, but he collapsed on the fifth-floor landing and lost consciousness, according to the woman, Melissa Butler.

Gurley was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died, police said. 

After Liang discharged the bullet, he and partner Shaun Landau did not respond to radio contact for more than 6.5 minutes, the New York Daily News reported in December. 

New York police almost immediately declared that his death was a 'very unfortunate tragedy' and commissioner Bill Bratton described Gurley as a 'total innocent.'

Police officials pieced together the details of the shooting from radio reports and interviews with the girlfriend and the second officer, but they have not spoken to Liang and won't until after the criminal proceedings are completed. 

Liang was placed on desk duty after the shooting.

The shooting came at a time when the NYPD, the nation's biggest police department, is changing how rookie officers are used fresh out of the academy to give them more training and time with more senior officers. 

The shooting recalled a 2004 incident in which 19-year-old Timothy Stansbury was shot dead by a startled officer on a Brooklyn rooftop of a housing complex. His family got a $2 million settlement with the city.

Patrick J. Lynch, head of Liang's union, said he deserves due process.

'The fact that he was assigned to patrol one of the most dangerous housing projects in New York City must be considered among the circumstances of this tragic accident,' Lynch said.
