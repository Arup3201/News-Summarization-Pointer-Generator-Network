Millions of viewers were already shocked and amazed by the antics of jobless Dean Bell and his family on a crime-riddled estate in Scunthorpe.

But when the former steel worker was shown on Channel 4 documentary Skint taking delivery of a top-of-the-range 3D 'cinema screen' TV paid for by welfare handouts, their outrage soared to new highs.

Twitter was flooded with messages of fury after the show's four million viewers saw the family of nine receiving the 47in TV before settling down in front of it wearing 3D glasses.

Family fun: Dean Bell and his family (from left Alfie, 5, Harry, 8, Leah, 12, Danny, 15, and wife Clare) were filmed enjoying their new 3D LG TV which cost £2,500

Outspoken: Bell, who is unemployed, said that taxpayers who may be unhappy with his decision to use his family's benefits to purchase the TV could 'f*** off'

Mr Bell, 37, supports his unemployed 
wife and their seven children by claiming £1,600 a month in welfare 
payments. He admits there isn't a job in his town that pays enough to 
persuade him to apply, and it's clear he feels no shame about his 
reliance on the state.

Now, not only is he spending £2,500 of
 his family's benefits on the high-end television, but this is £1,300 
more than its advertised price – because he is paying in weekly 
instalments over two years.

However, when told that taxpayers 
might be angered by the extravagant purchase, he said: 'I couldn't give a
 f*** what anyone thinks.'

Mr Bell also moaned that the price was
 higher because he could not pay the full amount upfront, adding: 'So 
b******* to them, who gives a f*** anyway?'

He continued: 'I don't care what they say, we are having to pay for this over two years.

'We can't afford to go out and pay for
 one straight away like those working-class people who have £2,000 a 
week coming in. It's us who is paying it, not them.'

TV stars: Dean and his wife Claire, pictured with their children, feature in the Channel 4 documentary series Skint which focuses on the lives of residents living on the Westcliff estate in Scunthorpe

Anger: The family have outraged viewers with their apparent aversion to 
work - with Bell previously claiming: 'There's nothing to do up here 
other than breed and feed'

Viewers of Skint – dubbed the 
real-life version of Shameless, in which Frank Gallagher fiddles his 
benefits and spends all his money on drugs and alcohol – were told how 
Mr Bell had to buy a new TV because his toddler broke the old one.

The couple, whose lifestyle was put 
under the spotlight in last Saturday's Daily Mail, have two young 
children together, and wife Claire has five from previous partners. In 
the last episode of the fly-on-the-wall documentary's depressing account
 of life on Scunthorpe's Westcliff estate, the family were shown sitting
 on the sofa watching the LG 'smart' TV, which boasts internet 
connectivity, surround sound, cinema-quality display, technology to 
convert 2D programmes into 3D and a 'magic remote' with voice 
recognition.

The show has been likened to Channel 4 drama Shameless, focusing on a family in a Manchester estate 

In an earlier episode Mr Bell 
complained he was forced to buy stolen goods because he couldn't afford 
to shop in supermarkets. 'I couldn't give a f*** what anyone thinks. 
I'll do anything for my kids, whether it's legal or illegal,' he said.

And when asked about life on the  
estate in Lincolnshire, he commented: 'There's nothing to do up here 
other than breed and feed.'

On the internet, the reaction to his 
latest purchase was almost universal condemnation. Twitter user 
Charlotte Simpson wrote: 'Why would you buy a high range TV if you can't
 feed your kids?'

Another under the name of Dr Next 
wrote: 'Save your benefits and move to where there is work rather than 
buy a 3D TV. Be a real man you scamming, free loading scum.'

Emma Louise Trotter added: 'I'm not 
against people who need benefits, but if you have a 47 inch screen but 
no money for your kids' food, then you need a rethink.'

Sarah Tucker tweeted: 'I don't know 
why I put myself through watching #skint. “It's us who pays it, not 
them.” Err, no it is US – the taxpayers.' Facebook user Leanne Forde 
posted: 'Awww poor Dean having to pay for a 47 inch TV over two years… 
correction, Dean is not paying, we are… if only he would let us fund him
 a vasectomy.'

As for the tattooed Mr Bell, he 
remained unperturbed. In response to the Twitter backlash, he wrote: 'I 
don't get thousands for nothing, I get tensathousands for free.' And at 
home in Scunthorpe, he refused to comment further, saying: 'I've got to 
speak to my agent first.'
