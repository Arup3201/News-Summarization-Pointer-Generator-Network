The Met Office was criticised over inaccurate forecasts ahead of the Big Freeze winter two years ago.

However, it now claims it is far better at predicting cold snaps weeks in advance.

Forecasters have come up with a computer program which can track changes high up in the atmosphere, which are thought to be key to extreme cold spells.

This ‘high top’ system includes weather patterns called sudden stratospheric warmings – SSWs – which block warm air flowing across the Atlantic to Northern Europe and cause temperatures to plunge. 

It was found in a study by Met Office climate experts to perform better than the model used at the time and would have predicted the weather chaos with more certainty. 

When the new system was used the following winter, it was able to predict freezing temperatures two months in advance, it said.

Forecasters insist they did warn about low temperatures in 2009-10 when the coldest winter for a century saw Britain blanketed in snow and the mercury plunge to minus 17.6C (0.3F).

They installed the new model in late 
2010, and tested it retrospectively for predicting weather from the 
previous October to February in a study published in Environmental 
Research Letters. Co-author Jeff Knight said by October 2010 the high 
top version of their computing system – named GloSea4 – was ‘indicating 
an increased chance of a cold start to winter’.

He said: ‘That year December was the second coldest in 350 years. It also highlighted the possibility that conditions in late winter were likely to be less harsh, which was indeed the case.

‘In 2011, GloSea4 predicted that a mild, westerly winter was likely. This turned out to be the case – only the first two weeks of February 2012 were cold.’ 

Ninety-day forecasts for the public were ditched in 2009 after a predicted ‘barbecue summer’ turned out to be a washout. The public can see a 30-day forecast and seasonal forecasts are only given to government and businesses. 

Met Office spokesman Dan Williams said: ‘The public have said they don’t find three-monthly outlooks useful because they are not the kind of thing you can plan a day trip out on.’ 

The World Meteorological Organisation yesterday said the hottest temperature ever recorded – 58C (136.4F) at El Azizia in Libya 90 years ago – was incorrect. The record is now held by Death Valley in California at 56.7C (134°F) on July 10, 1913.
