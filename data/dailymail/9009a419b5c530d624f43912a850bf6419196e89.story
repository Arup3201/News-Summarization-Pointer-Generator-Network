'All it takes is basic human decency': But Baroness Newlove said complaints about poor treatment by officialdom are still not being properly handled

Police, prosecutors and the courts are still failing to show enough compassion to victims of crime, a scathing report warned last night.

The Victims’ Commissioner Baroness Newlove – whose husband Garry was killed by a gang of yobs – said complaints about poor treatment by officialdom are not being properly handled.

Those who spoke out, including people who had been violently attacked or lost a loved one, said they were left feeling ‘dismissed’, ‘confused’ or ‘unimportant’. 

Ministers have repeatedly promised to make the justice system more considerate of victims and Tory peer Helen Newlove, 53, was appointed to check its progress.

However, in her first report, she found almost 75 per cent of victims who complained about the handling of their case were unhappy with the response. 

Baroness Newlove said: ‘It is shocking how many victims told me how ignored, dismissed and confused they felt when they tried to raise concerns about their treatment.

‘All it takes is basic human decency to explain to a victim, in a sensitive and timely way, why something has gone wrong and what they can do about it.

‘I have seen excellent examples of work by agencies across the country but it’s clear that many victims are still not getting the service they deserve.

The review found that there was ‘inadequate attention to the personal touch victims need’

One victim told Baroness Newlove: ‘I’m just frightened... I think they will harass me if I complain about the way they have treated me and my daughter.’

Another said: ‘I raised concerns about the process, the process was almost worse than the actual journey of being a victim.’

Baroness Newlove’s husband was murdered by yobs outside his home when he confronted a gang who were vandalising his car in Warrington, Cheshire in 2007.

He was kicked ‘like a football’, dying in hospital three days later.

Her report was backed by victims’ rights campaigner Maggie Hughes, whose son Robert was left with brain damage after being stabbed with a broken bottle and having his head stamped upon in 2008.

She said it was ‘crucial’ for the authorities to start listening. She added: ‘We victims are not just complainers. If anything, we are thrown into a new world of rules and regulations and then into a dark labyrinth of the unknown.

‘If we feel that we are not satisfied with a service, then we should be able to get clear guidelines on how to complain, regular updates and a full explanation of the outcome.”

Justice? Those who spoke out in Baroness Newlove's report, including people who had been violently attacked or lost a loved one, said they were left feeling ‘dismissed’, ‘confused’ or ‘unimportant’

Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: ‘This is a damning indictment of the way victims and witnesses have been let down by David Cameron’s Government.

‘We cannot go on treating victims as an afterthought or worse still ignoring them altogether. Victims losing confidence in our justice system leads to crimes going unreported and witnesses not providing evidence.

‘If victims give up on reporting matters and helping in prosecutions it could lead to the wheels of our justice system grinding to a halt leaving criminals roaming the streets.’

The Ministry of Justice said more money than ever before was being made available to support victims, with a potential budget of £100million.

Officials also highlighted steps to allow vulnerable witnesses to give evidence from outside the courtroom and plans to establish a new Victims’ Information Service by March 2015.

Victims’ Minister Mike Penning said: ‘I want to put the highest emphasis on the needs of victims, and an important part of that is making sure the criminal justice system always listens to what they have to say and treats them with the utmost respect and sensitivity.

‘To help achieve this I have already committed to enshrining their rights in law. We have also significantly strengthened their entitlements in the Victims’ Code, and are reviewing whether new powers are needed so that they can better hold the system to account.’
