A four-year-old child has died after being pulled unresponsive from a swimming pool on a Norwegian Cruise Line ship off the coast of North Carolina.

Crew members were able to revive a six-year-old boy also found in the pool before he was flown to hospital.

The two children were found yesterday morning on the Norwegian Breakaway, according to Norwegian Cruise Line's Facebook page.

An emergency medical team on the ship gave both children CPR. Their identities have not been revealed.

Coast Guard Petty Officer Adam SanSoucie said the boy was taken to Carteret General Hospital in Morehead City, N.C. with his grandmother and a nurse. They were flown by a Marine rescue helicopter. His condition is not known.

'We extend our deepest sympathies to the family during this extremely difficult time and are providing full assistance and support,' the cruise line said in its Facebook statement.

'The family is in our thoughts and prayers and we ask that you please keep them in your thoughts and prayers as well.'

The incident is being investigated. It was unclear where the ship was headed.

The Norwegian Cruise Line website describes the 4,000-passenger Norwegian Breakaway as the 'newest and largest ship embarking from NYC' to winter destinations including the Southern Caribbean, Bahamas and Florida.
