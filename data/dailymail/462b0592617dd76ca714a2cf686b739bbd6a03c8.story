A group of Chinese hospital bosses have been sacked after their medical staff caused outrage for taking selfies during an operating procedure.

Chinese health authorities were forced to act following public anger that erupted over pictures taken in an operating room showing a group of medical staff posing for photos while an unconscious patient lies beside them.

The photos were taken in August at the privately owned Fengcheng Hospital in the north-central city of Xi'an and leaked on social media at the weekend.

The pictures appear to show three surgeons continuing to work on the patient while a group of medical staff face the camera as a group.

Other images show some of the team flashing the 'V for victory' sign and grinning, and in one instance, the patient can be clearly seen.

The hospital's director, deputy director, the head nurse and chief of anesthetics were all fired, along with the staff members pictured, The Telegraph reported.

Online commentators criticized medical staff for being unprofessional and disrespectful of patients, while others defended the photos, saying they were intended to be private and were taken at the end of surgical procedures.

Tensions have run high between health workers and patients in China in recent years.

Patients often complain about poor medical services and high costs, especially the need to bribe doctors and nurses in exchange for competent services.

Chinese health workers say they are overworked, underpaid and underappreciated.

The Xi'an Bureau of Public Health, which handed out the punishment, said in a statement Sunday that the staff at Fengcheng took the photos to memorialize the operating room, which was to be relocated.

Nevertheless, the bureau said the picture-snapping violated proper medical procedures and had a negative social impact.

It also demanded that the hospital issue an open apology and rectify its management to avoid similar incidents in the future.
