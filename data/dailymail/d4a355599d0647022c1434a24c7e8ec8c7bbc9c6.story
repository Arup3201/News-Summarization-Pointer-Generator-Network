Sentenced: Janice Muriel Yost, 78, from Oregon has been jailed for two years and nine months after she stole money from her 98-year-old aunt 

A 78-year-old woman has been jailed after stealing from her 98-year-old aunt and fleeing to Arizona three times to avoid court appearances. 

Janice Muriel Yost from Oregon had power of attorney for her aunt after she hospitalized in 2008.

While in control of her possessions, she sold some of her aunt's jewelry and other items and pocketed the money.

She also raided her bank account, cashed in a $25,000 certificate of deposit and went on to spend the stolen funds on restaurants, hotels and travel.

According to Oregon Live, she finally ended up in court after she was extradited for the third time. 

After she was sentenced to two years and nine months in jail at Clackamas County Court in Oregon City, the aunt sat in her wheelchair and watched as Yost was taken away to the cells in handcuffs.

Prosecutor Stacey Borgman told the court: 'This woman, at her age, has caused more problems for the justice system than a 25-year-old. 

'This case has been going on for five years.'

Borgman added that Yost had tried to delay the case 'on the hope that it would never be resolved,' hinting that she hoped to outlive her aunt 

When the aunt first found out about the theft, Yost moved to Arizona. However a short time later she turned herself in and was ordered not to leave Oregon.

Despite the order, Yost fled again and failed to show up to a court hearing in 2011.

She was extradited in 2013 but subsequently did not appear at her trial and returned to Arizona.  

Yost was then convicted of aggravated theft and criminal mistreatment and was sentenced to 21 months in prison. The judge allowed her to turn herself in at the Clackamas County Jail, but she failed to show up/

Instead she drove a rental car to the Portland, Oregon, airport, removed an electronic monitoring device from her ankle and flew to Arizona.

At one point, Yost claimed that she was in a catastrophic car accident in Arizona that left her in a coma and took six months to recover.

She also said she cancer and foot problems that required surgery and feared she wouldn't get adequate medical care in prison and went to Arizona for treatment.

But Circuit Judge Douglas Van Dyk ignored her pleas, added a year to her original 21-month sentence and told the court: 'We're not going to debate this anymore. It's time for you to face the muster.'
