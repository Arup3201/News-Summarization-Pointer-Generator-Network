A classic car dealer is selling the perfect Jubilee gift for a patriotic petrolhead - the union flag-covered Jaguar E-Type used by Austin Powers.

This flamboyant 1970 convertible was one of two Jaguars used by film studios for the 1999 comedy The Spy who Sh***d Me.

The classic car went under a full restoration in 1999 ahead of its appearance in the spoof and has been driven just 6,500 miles since filming finished.

Star appeal: Mike Myer's as Austin Powers in the 1999 film The Spy Who Sha***d Me

It is now being offered for sale by 
Dutch dealer ER Classics for £71,000 - perfect timing ahead of this 
weekend’s Jubilee and the summer Olympics.

Under the bonnet of the 42-year-old car is a 4.2-litre engine which developed 265bhp when the car went on sale.

This gave it a 0-60mph time of 6.3 seconds and a top speed of 142mph.

But while it isn’t quick by today’s standards, the Jaguar E-Type retains its timeless beauty - albeit with a more patriotic paint job.

Ernest Praag, who is selling the car, said: 'It is a very rare and unique Jaguar and has the same potential as one of James Bond’s Aston Martins to be very a good investment.

'Now, being in Europe instead of the USA, the car is finally getting closer to its final destination, the United Kingdom.

'As an investment or for promotional 
use this car is now maybe even more interesting with the London Olympics
coming up this summer.'

Graham
Searle, the manager of the Jaguar Enthusiasts’ Club, added: 'Enzo 
Ferrari said the Jaguar E-Type was the most beautiful car and it is the 
only car in the New York Museum of Modern Art.

'There is a certain kudos with a film car so have a Series Two E-Type like this with its provenance is a good price.

'The
car looks like it would be a good buy, as long as you can live with the
paint job. If you want to be patriotic, it is a great car for this 
weekend.'
