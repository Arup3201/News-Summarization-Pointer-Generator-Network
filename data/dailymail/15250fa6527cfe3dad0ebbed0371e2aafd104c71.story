Forget tricks, it was all about the fashion treats on this weekend's X Factor.

Fleur East, without a doubt, stole the show thanks to her incredible interpretation of Michael Jackson's Thriller - Louis Walsh even described it as the most amazing performance he's ever seen on the show.

Gemma Sheppard, the X Factor stylist and the brains behind the carefully calculated outfit, shared the secrets behind Fleur's incredible look with FEMAIL - and, as we reveal in these exclusive behind the scenes images, it was a lot more complicated to pull off than it looked.

Dramatic change: Fleur East wowed the audience and judges with her performance of Thriller on the show and ripped off her couture gown to reveal a latex flesh dress

'We actually started the creation of Fleur's outfit last Sunday night, straight after the live shows,' Gemma told us.

While it looked spectacular on stage on Saturday night's show, the design process wasn't so glamorous.

Fleur had to be wrapped in cling film and tape so that Central St Martin's graduate Jack Irving could drip her in latex to start the creation of the 'flesh' dress that would be her thriller transformation.

Speaking about the inspiration behind the look, Gemma explained: 'Like the original video, we wanted ‎to create the gruesome change, so she opened the song in a bespoke Suzanne Neville gown.'

In the week - in between public appearances and singing rehearsals - Fleur visited Suzanne's boutique on Beauchamp Place, Knightsbridge for a fitting.

The result? An elegantly crafted silk chiffon gown that fit like a glove.

'Just as MJ looks like the perfect preppy teenager in the original video, I wanted Fleur to look a vision in exquisite couture, explained Gemma.

Meanwhile, Jack Irving was working on the latex dress, which he painted with acrylics and decorated with beadwork and Swarovski crystals.

Beauty buff: To ensure the singers' skin looks flawless on TV, under the harsh lighting, Julia explains how she and her team focus on concealing and use lots of light reflecting products to leave the skin looking youthful and radiant - just like Parisa's 

The Suzanne Neville gown, worn over the top of the flesh dress, was held together with velcro so it was easy for the big reveal on stage - and it certainly didn't disappoint the judges.

Fleur, too, said that it was her 'favourite performance ever' and no doubt her dramatic costume helped.

'Fleur is embracing every element of the X Factor journey,' added Gemma.

'Thriller was a huge act for her to take on and I wanted to support her with two incredible looks.'

As well as killer outfits, the contestants need dewy, HD-ready makeup. Julia Carta, who has worked with Britney Spears, Sienna Miller, Mirander Kerr and Jude Law, is the lady responsible for that.

Boys love beauty, too! The male contestants have lots of concealing applied with the Clinique Airbrush to get rid of dark circles and Julia, pictured with Ben Haenow, uses lots of light reflecting products on their skin

Head make-up artist Julia explained how important it is to prep the youngsters' skin.

'They do have a tough schedule so preparation is key to getting their skin ready. On a weekly basis we give all contestants a Red Carpet facial from Beautylab London - this deluxe VIP facial with the benefits of pure oxygen, stimulates collagen production and gives exceptional results to smooth and illuminate the complexion. 

'To keep the skin crystal clear they use Proactiv + daily. All contestants have a winter TV tan from Beautylab London to give them a natural healthy glow. The rest is clever illuminating HD makeup.'

And it's not just the girls who wear make-up. The boys have lots of concealer applied with the Clinique Airbrush to get rid of dark circles. They also have their brows threaded with Monika at Love Beauty (who runs the new Primark brow salons) and brows and lashes tinted to frame their face and make their eye colour pop.

Beauty treats: Dermot O'Leary uses philosophy microdelivery triple-acid brightening peel to keep his complexion smooth and radiant before facing the nation

Julia added: 'They have a dab of lip balm and sometimes we’ve been known to curl their lashes and comb them through with clear mascara. To give them healthy glowing skin we give them a Beautylab London winter tan and use bronzer to give them a healthy glow.' 

As for presenter Dermot O'Leary - he has been reaching for the philosophy microdelivery triple-acid brightening peel to keep his complexion smooth and radiant before facing the nation.

The pads promise to deliver advanced-skin brightening benefits, dissolve dull skin and buffer the appearance of fine lines - you'd hope so for £59.50 a pop!

Speaking about the highs and lows of her job, Julia said: 'Make-up is a really powerful tool and I love making up the contestants; giving them bespoke looks every week. 

'It's instant job satisfaction watching them grow and knowing the small part I play alongside our creative team gives them inner confidence which enables them to deliver a better performance. 

'My least favourite thing is losing the contestants on a Sunday, I dread saying goodbye.'

Sadly for Julia, she had to wave goodbye to Jack Walton and Lola Saunders on the ITV show this weekend.  

Style supremo: Gemma Sheppard, the X Factor stylist and the brains behind the carefully calculated outfit, shared the secrets behind Fleur's incredible look with FEMAIL 

Secret weapon: One of Jamie Stevens' team can be seen using the Tresemme dust to give Betsy Blue's hair some real oomph

The X Factor Stylist, Jamie Stevens, says: ’We saw cornrows on the AW14 catwalks, but they can look quite severe, so we wanted to make this trend more wearable, Lauren has tight braids on one side and loose, soft waves on the other.'

STEP 1: Apply TRESemmé Texture Style Tousled Wave Spray (RRP £5.50 for 200ml) to towel dried hair and roughly blow dry for a textured, matt finish. 

STEP 2: Using medium tongs begin working around the head, curling the hair but leaving the last two inches of each section so this stays straight. Once finished, loosely brush out the curls. (At this stage, we added tinsel hair extensions to complement Lauren’s outfit - you can use some clip in extensions for the same effect.) 

STEP 3: Use a tail comb to create a low side parting and create four tight braids, each one inch thick, plaiting from the front of the head to the nape and secure with an elastic. 

STEP 4: Tease the curls so they look undone and spray all over the hair with TRESemmé Ultimate Hold Hairspray (RRP £4.99 for 500ml). 

Get the look: Lauren has tight braids on one side and loose, soft waves on the other. Here, Jamie shows us how to recreate the look at home
