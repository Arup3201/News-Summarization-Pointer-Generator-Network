Police in New York have been handing out fliers to tourists advising them that tipping the costumed characters who pose for photographs is entirely optional - and to call the 911 emergency number if they have any problems.

City officials say they had to take action after physical attacks on some visitors, including children. The unruliness peaked last month when a Spider-Man was accused of punching a police officer for telling a woman the character could not force her to pay up.  

The new crackdown is in response to tourists often feel pressured to tip anything from $5 to $20 (£3 to £12) after getting a photograph.

Advice: These fliers have been circulated around Times Square by the police

Bright red police leaflets in five languages are being handed out by police warning Times Square tourists that photos with costumed characters are free, and tipping is optional.

Characters including Elmo from Sesame Street, Mickey Mouse, SpongeBob and the Statue of Liberty are among the workers who offer to have their photos taken with tourists in Times Square. 

Hours after the fliers started circulating Saturday, four fake superheroes were arrested for blocking pedestrians and grabbing one for a picture.

Some of the mostly Spanish-speaking immigrants who wear the giant costumes say they have been left with far less to feed their families.

'Photos with costumed characters are free. Tipping is optional,' read the warnings in English, Spanish, Chinese, German and French. Visitors are told to find police or call the emergency dispatcher if they're being pressured for cash.

Standing 7ft tall and swathed in light green robes with an American flag pouring down her right arm, Lady Liberty - as played by Hugo Gomez, a 34-year-old Dominican immigrant with three children - has a prime spot in the middle of Times Square.

He told a reporter that before the police-enforced measure, he drew about $150 (£90) in tips each day. In recent days, he made about $40 (£24).

Gomez said he never begs. People still come to him, but the cash has shrunk. And standing on prosthetic devices for five-hour stretches is taking a toll, he said - without much payoff.

'My skin swells every day,' he said.

One Elmo who's losing money is angry at police.

'All they say is, "Go, go, go away, move, move, move!"' says Alberto Ramirez, a Peruvian native from New Jersey standing by the TKTS theater discount booth, where people in line behind barricades are an easy target.

He says he pulled in $20 (£12) for eight hours, half of the $40 (£24) he made before, with five kids to feed.

City officials say the warnings were needed to curtail any abuse.

'They're doing it for people's safety,' says Barati Narasim, a New York mother and software expert who offered a few dollars to a Spider-Man posing with her son and his friend.

The City Council is working on a bill to require licensing, something Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance, says would help legitimate operators by putting "bad players" out of business.

Even Gomez, aka Lady Liberty, favours licensing.

'We all know legalising our work with a license, he said, 'would make things normal, smoother.'

Last month a man dressed as Spider-Man was charged with punching a police officer who intervened in a tipping dispute with a tourist.

Three more men dressed as Spider-Man, Iron Man and Elmo were arrested at the weekend and charged with disorderly conduct for obstructing pedestrian traffic.

The man dressed as Spider-Man faces an additional charge of aggressive solicitation while another man dressed as Iron Man was also given a court summons.
