Amazon is set to take on the big supermarkets with the launch of a fresh food home delivery service in the UK.

The company already offers the AmazonFresh service in Seattle, and is now rolling it out to other US cities. According to industry experts, the next step will be to bring it to the UK and Europe.

At the moment, the retailer sells long-life grocery items such as tea, cereals, pasta and herbs through its UK website, but the AmazonFresh service extends this to a full range of fresh and frozen foods.

Charles Wilson, chief executive of food wholesaler Booker, said the US retailer is powerful enough to challenge supermarket giants such as Tesco and Sainsbury’s.

Mr Wilson added: ‘These online players have huge financial strength to take growth away from the traditional supermarkets.’

In the US, shoppers who place an order by 10am get a delivery from one of Amazon’s green vans in time for dinner.

Delivery is free for those spending more than $35 (£22), but customers must be members of Amazon Prime, which comes with an annual fee of $300 (£190).

Doug Gurr, vice-president of Amazon UK, previously ran Asda’s food home shopping service. He has hinted at the expansion of AmazonFresh, saying: ‘We have just started rolling that out across America.

‘Our model tends to be to take something and to try really hard to make it work and then, when we think we have got it right, start rolling it out.’
