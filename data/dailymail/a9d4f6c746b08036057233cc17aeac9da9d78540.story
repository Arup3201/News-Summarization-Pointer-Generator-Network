Hopes for a new gas boom in Britain were dealt a blow yesterday as MPs voted through a raft of tough regulations on fracking.

Labour forced ministers to agree 12 new restrictions on shale drilling last night, which critics say will further hold up the industry for months or even years.

David Cameron and George Osborne have called for the UK to go ‘all out for fracking’ as soon as possible, as it could bring down energy bills and create thousands of jobs.

But Labour frontbenchers have hardened their opposition to the idea, for fear of losing voters to the Greens.

Shadow ministers Caroline Flint and Angela Eagle had vowed to call a halt to extraction of shale gas altogether yesterday unless the government met a series of new standards.

Ministers feared that opposition from Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs, as well as a number of Conservatives who believe it will be unpopular in their constituencies, could derail the entire operation.

The Government last night agreed to a complete ban on fracking in national parks, near water sources and in areas of outstanding natural beauty.

More rigorous risk assessments for drilling and controls on the emissions it produces will be enforced, and every resident who will have gas drilling taking place hundreds of feet underneath their homes must be notified in advance.

One Lib Dem ministerial aide Tessa Munt, MP for Wells in Somerset where several fracking licences have been granted, had threatened to resign if the bill went through without changes.

After the amendments were agreed, the Infrastructure Bill – which will help fracking go ahead - was voted through by MPs by a margin of 324 votes to 231. 

This headed off the prospect of a complete moratorium on fracking, which was then voted down by 308 votes to just 52, despite the backing of Green MP Caroline Lucas and others.

Tory MP Tim Yeo, chairman of the Commons energy committee, said some of the regulations were ‘onerous’.

‘I hope there will enough momentum - at least in some parts of the country - to get it going anyway but this will make it more difficult’, he said.

‘There has been a lot of emotion and misinformation in this debate and I think when fracking is up and running people will not be opposed to it.

‘Some of the amendments such as notifying people, are sensible, but others are more onerous. We will rely on gas for many years to come, and we may as well use our own rather than other people’s.’

Energy minister Matt Hancock warned last week against too much regulation and accused Labour of ‘putting their political problems ahead of the national interest.’

Britain has vast potential reserves of gas trapped in rocks hundreds of feet underground, which could be extracted by fracking – pumping water and chemicals at high pressure to crack the rocks open.

It is already a big industry in the USA where household energy costs have plummeted.

The Prime Minister reiterated his support yesterday saying: ‘I want to see unconventional gas properly exploited in our country.’

‘I think there are good reasons for doing this: we want to have greater energy security, and that should mean making the most of our indigenous energy supplies; we want to keep prices down, I think that’s important; we also want to tackle climate change, and so exploiting some of our own gas rather than shipping it from other parts of the world can make a contribution.’

The Government’s chief scientific adviser Sir Mark Walport also gave his backing, saying shale gas produces fewer emissions than coal and could act as ‘a bridge to a greener future.’

Among those against fracking is Green MP Caroline Lucas, who was arrested at a protest against shale drilling in 2013

But a Tory source said after the vote: ‘It was between getting this through with cross-party approval or simply having the applications knocked back by councils later.

‘We already have one of the toughest regulatory regimes in the world. These are not huge concessions, and we are happy if they make fracking sustainable and make people feel reassured.’

A government spokesperson said: ‘Shale gas has the potential to support UK energy security, create 64,000 jobs and help the low carbon transition. We have agreed to accept this amendment, to provide clear reassurance in law, and to give this nascent industry has the best possible chance of success.’

Ministers only rejected one of the 13 ‘loopholes’ Labour vowed to close, which would have meant that fracking could only take place at least 1,000 metres underground, as this would halt development.

Green campaigners celebrated last night. Donna Hume at Friends of the Earth said: ‘Public opinion and increasing concern from MPs has forced the Government into retreat on fracking.’

Miss Flint said last night: ‘This is a huge U-turn by the Government and big victory for the protection of Britain’s environment. Labour has always said that shale gas extraction cannot go ahead unless there is a system of robust regulation and comprehensive inspection, but David Cameron has repeatedly ignored people’s genuine and legitimate environmental concerns over shale gas.’
