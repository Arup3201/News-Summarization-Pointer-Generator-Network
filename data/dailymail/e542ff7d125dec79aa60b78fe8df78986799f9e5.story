Record numbers of patients are being admitted to hospital wards from A&E, in further evidence of an overcrowding crisis.

Last week there were 108,301 emergency admissions – mostly elderly – from A&E. This was the most since figures were first collected four years ago.

Data also showed 6,587 of them had to wait on trolleys for between four and 12 hours – twice as many as in the same week last year.

Yesterday it emerged that hospital managers were planning to take legal action to evict elderly patients who were blocking beds, to free up space on wards. 

Overcrowding in some A&E departments is now believed to be the worst in living memory

Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals Trust in Dorset is giving families seven days to find a place for patients in care homes before they start court proceedings.

‘Bed-blocking’ describes when elderly patients remain in hospital despite being fit for discharge because care at home has not been set up for them, or they do not have a place in a nursing home. The problem has reached record levels across the NHS and is causing A&E units to become overcrowded because patients cannot be moved up to wards. In addition, A&E admissions are rising as patients find it increasingly hard to get an appointment with their GPs. The increase is also being driven by an ageing population.

Furthermore, pressure has intensified over the past few weeks with the onset of winter illnesses, and many casualty departments have urged people to stay away unless severely hurt or ill.

Figures published yesterday by NHS England, the body that runs the Health Service, revealed that A&E units were struggling to cope with rising demand.

A total of 429,200 patients were admitted to emergency departments last week, a rise of more than 5 per cent compared with the same time last year. Some 30,102 patients waited more than the Government’s four-hour limit to be treated – twice as many as this time last year, and the most in 18 months.

But officials failed to publish another key set of statistics showing the number of cancelled operations, A&E units closed because they were full, and ambulances diverted to other hospitals.

These so-called winter-pressure figures are normally released weekly from mid-November, but NHS England said there would be a ‘temporary’ delay while it reviewed ‘information requirements’.

Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said: ‘It is clear hospitals in all parts of England are struggling to cope. This Tory-led Government pushed elderly care services to the brink, leaving people turning to A&E. Whole hospitals are being overwhelmed by the pressure. They have ignored the problem for far too long and it is threatening to drag down the NHS this winter.’

Over the past fortnight, hospitals in Scunthorpe in Lincolnshire, King’s Lynn in Suffolk, Middlesbrough in North Yorkshire, Wigan in Greater Manchester and the Wirral in Cheshire have asked the public to avoid A&E except in genuine emergencies.

Last week, a major incident was declared at Colchester hospital in Essex after the NHS watchdog found A&E staff were struggling to cope with unprecedented demand.

The pressures are particularly intense in Cambridgeshire, which has a large elderly population. Its three trusts are on ‘black alert’, meaning they are unwilling to accept patients who are not seriously ill.

Dr Louise Irvine, a GP in Lewisham, South London, who also represents the National Health Action Party, said: ‘Hospitals and patients are caught up in a desperate situation created by cuts. Hospitals throughout the country are being very tightly squeezed financially, so there is very little slack in the system.’

Sarah Pinto-Duschinsky, of NHS England, said: ‘The NHS is pulling out all the stops to meet this rising demand.’
