Over two weeks on from the Connecticut school massacre during which Adam Lanza massacred 26 people, it has been revealed that his father has quietly claimed his son's body for burial.

An anonymous spokesperson for the family who spoke to the Associated Press said that Peter Lanza collected his son several days ago

The 20-year-old killed 20 first-graders and six adults at the Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14th in a hail of assault weapon fire.

He also killed his mother in their Newtown home before going on the rampage and then committing suicide.

Multiple earlier reports from the weekend said that the body had been claimed several days ago by a person who did not wish to be identified.

A private funeral was held earlier this month in New Hampshire for his mother, Nancy Lanza, who was divorced from Peter Lanza.

Peter Lanza lives in Stamford, Conn., and is a tax director at General Electric.

Connecticut's chief medical examiner Wayne H. Carver IIÂ told the Hartford Courant that the location of Lanza's burial will not be made public.

When asked by the paper if Lanza's father Peter Lanza who claimed the body, Carver would not comment.

A spokeswoman at the medical examiner's office told The Associated Press she could not release any details about the status of Lanza's remains.

A private funeral was held earlier this month in New Hampshire for his mother, Nancy Lanza, who was shot to death in her bed on the morning of the school shooting rampage.

Police have not offered a motive for the killings.

Earlier this week, it was revealed that scientists
have been asked to study Lanza's DNA to see if
has an 'evil' gene that led him to carry out the massacre.

The study,
which will look at any abnormalities or mutations in his individual DNA, is
believed to be the first of its kind ever carried out on a mass murderer.The
massacre prompted President Obama to look into new gun controls and banning
assault rifles such as AR-15 Bushmaster used by Lanza in his rampage.

The study
of the killer's DNA was been ordered by Carver - who carried out the post-mortems on all the victims.

He has
contacted geneticists at University of Connecticut's to conduct the study.

Geneticists
said they are likely looking at Lanza's DNA to detect a mutation or abnormality
that could increase the risk of aggressive or violent behavior.

They could
analyse Lanza's entire genome in great detail and try to find any unexpected
mutations.

Arthur
Beaudet, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine, said the University of
Connecticut geneticists are most likely trying to 'detect clear
abnormalities of what we would call a mutation in a gene'.

He added: 'Or gene abnormalities and there are some abnormalities that are related
to aggressive behavior.

'They
might look for mutations that might be associated with mental illnesses and
ones that might also increase the risk for violence.

Beaudet,
who is also the chairman of Baylor College of Medicine's department of
molecular and human genetics in Houston, Texas said geneticists should be doing
this type of research because there are 'some mutations that are known to
be associated with at least aggressive behavior if not violent behavior.'

'I
don't think any one of these mutations would explain all of (the mass
shooters), but some of them would have mutations that might be causing both
schizophrenia and related schizophrenia violent behavior,' Beaudet said.

'I think we could learn more about it and we should learn more about
it.'

Beaudet,who
is chairman of the Baylor College department of molecular and human genetics,
said studying the genes of murderers is controversial because there is a risk
that those with similar genetic characteristics could possibly be discriminated
against or stigmatized.

But he said
the research into Lanza would be helpful even if only a "fraction"
may have the abnormality or mutation.

'Not
all of these people will have identifiable genetic abnormalities,' Beaudet
told ABC News in America.

'By
studying genetic abnormalities we can learn more about conditions better and
who is at risk and what might be dramatic treatments,' Beaudet said,
adding if the gene abnormality is defined the 'treatment to stop'
other mass shootings or 'decrease the risk is much approved.'

Although
known to be shy and social inept Lanza had not shown any violent streak
although he was known to spend hours in the basement of his home playing
violent video games.
