A couple of Iowa sisters, aged 8 and 10, have taken to YouTube to lobby their state representative into reducing the minimum age on when kids can fire handguns.

Nathan Gibson, from Johnston, began taking his daughters Meredith and Natalie to the shooting range when they were five, but on a recent trip he was told a little known Iowa law prevented children younger than 14 from using a handgun at all, even with parental supervision.

Outraged, he has contacted local and state officials to argue against the law, and the girls' videos begging 'please let me use my .22' will be used by the Iowa Gun Owners organization from today in its campaign to eliminate age restrictions for handgun use all together.

In a video now posted on YouTube, the fourth-grader says: 'It's fun shooting my gun with my daddy, and I can learn how to safely handle it and protect myself and my family if needed to.'

Both girls claim that they love shooting their guns because it means they can spend time with their father.

'It makes me feel sad because then I won't be able to spend time with my daddy,' Natalie told the Des Moines Register about the law.

The law barring any handgun use by youths under 14 gained attention earlier this year when a Democratic legislator tried to lower the legal age from 14 to 12 in a bid to allow more kids to safely practice shooting handguns.

The bill failed to become law, however, because of the media coverage more gun ranges are enforcing the existing law and telling youngsters to leave, even if they've been shooting at that range for years.

Fun: In a video now posted on YouTube, the fourth-grader, shown here when she was six, says: 'It's fun shooting my gun with my daddy, and I can learn how to safely handle it and protect myself and my family if needed to'

In contrast, state law provides no 
minimum age for long guns, including Mr Gibson's AR-15 .308 deer-hunting
 rifle, and Meredith points out this quirk in her bubbly video.

Under Iowa law, 'I'm unable to shoot my handgun,' Meredith says in the message to Republican state Representative Clel Baudler.

Baudler is the chairman of the Iowa House Public Safety Committee.

She
 then, without looking at her handgun, locks the slide, ejects the 
magazine and sets the empty magazine on her family's kitchen table 
before walking over to the .308 rifle.

'I think we can both agree that this gun is way too big for me,' she says.

The rationale behind the difference in 
the laws is that long guns are used for hunting, and children should be 
able to hunt with supervision from a parent.

But child psychiatrist Kathleen Adams told the Register that handguns should be treated differently because they're about self-defense, not sport.

She told the newspaper that teaching kids how to shoot handguns implies there might be an appropriate time for them to use the gun in a situation they consider dangerous, whether an adult is there or not.

'We should teach them ways to solve 
conflicts that don't involve guns,' said Adams.

'And it's really 
important for kids to have confidence that their world is safe and that 
the adults in their world are going to keep them safe.'

Anne
 Starr, the CEO at Orchard Place, a Des Moines psychiatric medical 
institute for youths, said keeping unstable children away from guns was 
'a good thing.'

But she said she was undecided as far as the general youth population was concerned.

'Each kid is different in terms of their development and what they can and can't handle and the culture in a family and whether guns are part of that culture,' Starr said.

Mr Gibson said his girls are involved in other activities such as dance and basketball but shooting was a big part of their father-daughter time.

And Iowa Gun Owners' executive director, Aaron Dorr, told the Register this was not only fun but a 'wise' decision.

'Any father would be wise to show his daughter how to defend herself,' he said.

Dorr is hoping the Gibson sisters' videos, which he plans to distribute widely, will help the organization get the guns back in the hands of children soon.

'The real sad thing for us is more and more kids are now being kicked off gun ranges like the Gibson kids,' he told Register. 'But it's a simple fix. Take out the age restriction.'
