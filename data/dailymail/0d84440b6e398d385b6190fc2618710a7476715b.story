Harry Redknapp was a worried man when he drove back down the A1 after QPR lost a pre-season friendly at Peterborough.

Many were expecting his team — with a wage bill bigger than Borussia Dortmund’s and with a plethora of Premier League stars — to run away with the Sky Bet Championship and return to the top flight.

But after a 1-0 defeat by the League One side, Redknapp feared they would tumble down another tier. ‘It was a concern,’ he  admits. ‘At Peterborough, when I drove down after the game, I thought we’re going to have a difficult season; I didn’t like the look of us. So, when we started well in the league it gave everyone a lift.

Concern: Harry Redknapp admits he was worried about how QPR would fare in the Championship

Tall order: The QPR boss knew he needed around two points per game to beat Burnley to finishing top 

‘But I couldn’t see us running away with it. People always said Burnley would fall away. I didn’t think they would. I thought for us to finish above Burnley we’re going to need 86-87 points — and winning two points a game is never easy.’

Despite Redknapp’s fears, QPR have not been outside the top five all season. They are three games away from winning promotion, starting with the first leg of their play-off at Wigan on Friday.

But, including loans, 25 players have left the club since last summer.

‘A lot of them were good, players you’d love to have here,’ he says. ‘We couldn’t keep them all. Their wages were too high. If Loic Remy had stayed, we’d have got promoted. He’d have got you 25 goals. Stephane M’Bia has played for Seville in the Europa League semi-final. He’d’ve been a big player. Adel Taarabt is playing at AC Milan. They’ve not exactly gone to bad clubs.’

Redknapp says he is in the dark about the financial future if QPR don’t win promotion this year. But he is confident they will not lose their star players, with top-flight clubs monitoring Charlie Austin, Joey Barton and Bobby Zamora.

Hands off! Redknapp is confident of keeping hold of his star players, including Charlie Austin

The conversation turns to England. The 67-year-old was the man-in-the-street’s favourite for the job, before Roy Hodgson was chosen.

Had he been picked, Redknapp would have been preparing for a World Cup in Brazil, instead of a Friday night in Wigan.

‘That seems years ago. It’s way gone,’ he says. ‘I like Roy. I get on well with him. I wish him every success. I don’t live my life like that.’

Even so, he will be watching back home on television.

‘I think we’ll get out of the group,’ he says. ‘I don’t think it’s as hard a group as everyone says.

‘The draw was decent. Uruguay have got Luis Suarez, Edinson Cavani, the boy Diego Godin, but they’re not overloaded. It’s not a great Italian team either. We’ll have a decent run.

‘I wouldn’t say we’ll win it, I think one of the South American teams will; the best European bet is Germany. But we’ll make the quarter-final and maybe even the semi-final.’

It will make more enjoyable viewing for Redknapp if he is plotting a season in the Premier League.

There can be only one: Uwe Rosler insists QPR are under more pressure than his Wigan side

Meanwhile, Wigan manager Uwe Rosler has claimed QPR owner Tony Fernandes will be feeling ‘massive pressure’ to see his club seal an instant return to the Barclays Premier League, ahead of tonight’s play-off first leg at the DW Stadium.

But after chuckling at Redknapp’s assertion that Wigan were favourites to follow Leicester and Burnley into the Barclays Premier League, Rosler suggested Fernandes could ill afford another season in the Championship after racking up a wage bill that’s ‘three times bigger than ours.’

With a Wembley date against Derby or Brighton at stake, Rosler said: ‘What we have is pressure bingo. You are under pressure, no you are, and so it goes on.’
