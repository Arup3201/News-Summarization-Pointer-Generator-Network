A transgender woman was held as a sex slave for months and beaten by a Louisiana trio - who seem to have confessed to the abuse with online memes.

A town marshal in Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana, found the woman, whose identity has been withheld, with a logging chain wrapped around her near a Natchitoches highway, KATC reported. Police said the chain was removed by firefighters.

David Rodriguez Jr., 37, his wife Christina Harper, 39, and their friend Ambre Lomas, 39, turned themselves in to the Natchitoches Parish Sheriff's Office. They face multiple charges, including human trafficking, kidnapping, false imprisonment and battery.

Suspects: Couple Christina Harper and David Rodriguez, pictured, reportedly kept a woman as a sex slave in their home and abused her

Alleged suspect: Ambre Lomas, seen here in her booking photo, also allegedly beat and abused the victim

Digital connection: Rodriguez and Harper reportedly met the victim online through a BDSM website

Harper's Facebook page has several Bit Strip animated memes that appear to show her and Lomas abusing the victim. One shows Harper whipping the victim and comes with the tag that the victim 'thinks Christina is a real slave driver.'

The victim, who is from Minnesota, agreed to move into Rodriguez and Harper's home about two years ago after meeting on a BDSM website, police said in a press conference. Though Rodriguez allegedly helped her move in, she told police she was forced to give him her money and her motorcycle.

Rodriguez then allegedly tattooed the woman and listed her as a slave online.

'In this particular case, the victim probably had some depression, going through the sex change, being disowned by her family,' Natchitoches Parish Sheriff's Office criminal investigator Carey Etheredge said in the press conference. 'Suspects prey on people in this situation. They know how to talk to them, what to say to them to make them feel comfortable and make them think they’re coming to live a different life.'

The woman was forced to perform sex acts, along with serving food and beverages, completing yardwork and working on a swimming pool, she told police.

If she refused, Rodriguez, Harper and Lomas allegedly beat her and carved markings into her body, police said. The trio also allegedly tazed her and threw water on her.

Authorities said in a press conference the woman slept in a 3-by-5 wooden box.

Cruel humor: Harper, right, is depicted as 'a real slave-driver' abusing the victim, whose identity has been withheld

Macabre: Another meme appeared online showing Lomas apparently trying to hide Harper's dead body in a wooden box...not unlike the 3-by-5-foot box their alleged victim slept in

Pain: Harper seems ready to drill into Lomas in this brutal meme

The woman was chained outside for two days after she said she wanted to leave, KATC reported. The woman was allegedly taken to a building and chained inside. She escaped and drove one of the suspects' cars before she approached the assistant town marshal.

Police have said that the relationship was consensual at one point, but they do not know which acts the victim was forced into, the Town Talk points out.

NPSO Chief Investigator Greg Dunn told KATC that deputies recovered 15 guns, a stun gun, and digital equipment when they
 searched the home on Wednesday. Two teenage children were also removed from the home and placed in child protective services.

Rodriguez, Harper and Lomas are currently held in Natchitoches Parish Detention Center and the victim is in protective custody, KATC reported.

Harper and Lomas' social media profiles include jokey Bitstrips memes with the women as cartoon characters, and include references to beatings, whippings and death. Multiple images, some of which were uploaded by their alleged victim, show the woman as the recipient of abuse.

Harper is referred to as 'a real slave-driver' as she whips the woman in a cartoon while dressed as an Egyptian pharaoh. Another image shows her stuck in a fiery pit as Satan looks on.

Other memes show Lomas and Harper apparently abusing one another.

One image shows Lomas as a circus master getting ready to whip Harper, as if she is an animal performing. The caption reads 'Ambre ties to tame the wild Christina.'

A different meme shows Lomas trying to stuff an apparently dead Harper into a trunk.

Lomas' Facebook page also shows an interst in gothic music and rock. She uploaded photos of herself dressed as a nun with heavy eyeliner when she reportedly attended a concert for gothic metal band Ghost last month.
