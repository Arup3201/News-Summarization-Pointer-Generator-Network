A bride-to-be nearly died after suffering crippling stomach pain at a Bon Jovi concert when an ulcer in her abdomen burst.

With three months to go until her big day, Tracy Rainieri, 42, went to the concert at Cardiff City Stadium with her fiancé, when she suffered crippling the excruciating pain later diagnosed as a perforated ulcer.

The mother-of-one was put into an induced coma as doctors battled to save her life.

But after recovering from her life-threatening ordeal Mrs Rainieri walked down the aisle as planned last October.

Mrs Rainieri said: ‘I thanked my lucky stars as I walked weakly towards my groom.

'To me, the day couldn’t have been more perfect.

'I can’t believe I almost died before my wedding day.’

Her now husband, Massimo Rainieri, 38, proposed on Christmas Day, 2012.

Before she fell ill, Mrs Rainieri, from Pontypridd in South Wales, had been planning her nuptials in Cardiff.

By June 2013, she had already booked the venue, picked a dress, chosen flowers and booked a photographer.

The mother-of-one, who runs an online personal assistant business, started to experience sharp pains in her stomach several days before she and her now husband joined friends at a Bon Jovi concert on June 12.

‘I was at the concert with Massimo and two friends and I could feel a sharp pain in my tummy,’ she said.

‘I popped a painkiller and tried to ignore it - I had been having the pains for the last two days but I wanted to enjoy the concert.

‘Then later
 that night I woke up in absolute agony. My stomach felt like it was on 
fire and I begged Massimo to take me to hospital.’

Doctors at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant, told Mrs Rainieri that she had a perforated duodenal ulcer.

Mrs Rainieri's condition is rare and affects around one in 350 people with a stomach ulcer.

The lining of the stomach splits open, which is serious because it enables the bacteria living in the stomach to escape and infect the lining of the abdomen.

The most common symptom of this peritonitis is sudden abdominal pain, which gets steadily worse.

In peritonitis, an infection can rapidly spread into the blood before spreading to other organs.

This carries the risk of multiple organ failure and can be fatal if left untreated.Source: NHS Choices

A perforated ulcer is a potentially life-threatening condition where an untreated ulcer can burn through the wall of the stomach allowing digestive juices and food to escape into the abdominal cavity.

She said: ‘Poison was rapidly swimming through my body and they had to operate fast.’

When medics anesthetised Mrs Rainieri she had a severe allergic reaction and went into anaphylactic shock, causing parts of her body to swell up and her heart to stop.

Surgeons were forced to put her into an induced coma, while they worked on repairing her stomach lining.

Two days 
later Mrs Rainieri came around and a fortnight later she underwent a 
second operation to restore her perforated stomach lining.

But it was not until a month after being first admitted that doctors said she was well enough to go home.

Despite being put into an induced coma at the time, she was healthy enough to enjoy her honeymoon three months later (pictured)

Mrs Rainieri said: ‘I returned home in July, weak as a kitten and weighing just seven stone.

‘I
 thought my wedding dreams were shattered and that I couldn’t get 
married in the state I was in. I could hardly walk and I still had the 
feeding tube in my stomach.

‘I
 hadn’t even had time to send the wedding invitations out, and I thought
 about calling it off, but I would have to have been back in hospital 
before I seriously considered cancelling.’

Determined that the wedding day should not be postponed, Mrs Rainieri’s mother and future husband took over the planning of the big day.

‘My mum took up the organising and Massimo told me to focus on walking down the aisle,’ she said.

On October 6, 2013, the couple were married in front of 70 guests.

She said: ‘It was a relief to me and everyone else that I made it to the wedding.

‘In every photo I have this stupid grin on my face, I was in pain and I was really weak but I could not stop smiling. It was one of the best days of my life.’

Mr and Mrs Rainieri’s first dance was to the Bon Jovi power ballad Always.

Mrs Rainieri said: ‘I still wanted to have my first dance to Bon Jovi, even though I nearly died the day I saw them in concert.’

The mother-of-one is recovering well and enjoying married life.
