Ten people have died after a chartered air taxi crashed and burst into flames at a remote municipal airport in Alaska's Kenai Peninsula.

The crash of the single-engine de Havilland DHC-3 Otter air taxi claimed the lives of the pilot and all nine passengers aboard.

Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board are not sure whether the plane was landing or taking off when it went down at Soldotna Municipal Airport about 11.20am on Sunday.

Rediske Air operated several de Havilland DHC-3 Otter single-engine planes (pictured). The plane that crashed was capable of carrying 20 people

This marks the second deadly airplane crash in two days - coming just 25 hours 
after an Asiana Airlines jetliner with 291 people aboard crashed and 
cart-wheeled off the runway at San Francisco International Airport. Two 16-year-old Chinese students died and more than 180 were injured.

Alaska State Troopers said the plane was chartered as an air taxi at the time of the crash.

After it plummeted to Earth, the plane caught fire and had to be extinguished by firefighters from Soldotna.

For many Alaskans, flying across the 
state is common, exposing residents to a litany of hazards including 
treacherous mountain passes and volatile weather.

Alaska
already has seen several plane crashes this year, including a June 28 
crash that killed a pilot and two passengers on a commercial tour in the
Alaska Range.

The National Transportation Safety Board has scrambled a 'go team' to investigate the cause of the crash, which is said to have claimed the life of the owner of Rediske Air, a plane charter company

The Peninsula Clarion newspaper reports 
that the plane was being flown by Willy Rediske, the owner of Rediske 
Airlines - an air taxi and charter service.

In a 2011 story in General Aviation News, Mr Rediske said his father started Rediske Airlines as a charter plane service in 1991.

He said he and his sister took over the company in 2001 and grew it into a company with multiple offices and charter plans across the state of Alaska.

The NTSB is sending a team to investigate the crash. NTSB spokesman Eric Weiss said one local member of the team was at the scene Sunday evening.

Soldotna is 64 miles south of Anchorage on the Kenai Peninsula. However, because of the circuitous highway required, the trip by car is nearly 150 miles.

The crash occurred about 65 miles from Anchorage on the Kenai Peninsula
