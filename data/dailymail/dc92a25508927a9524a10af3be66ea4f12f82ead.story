A furious four-wheel drive enthusiast has exposed the filthy state of his local bushland, which has been overrun by illegal dumpers, and slammed those responsible for the mess.

Steve Shotton's video, in which he filmed himself driving along a dirt track close to the M1 Motorway at Tarro, near Newcastle in New South Wales, is gaining thousands of views each day since it was shared online on Tuesday.

'People need to see this. All you city folk sitting there, you need to see this,' Mr Shotton is heard saying in the footage which goes on to display kilometres of waste strewn across a scenic forest landscape.

'Bloody atrocious' were the only words the father-of-three could think of to describe the heaps of furniture and garbage that had been piled up along the track, 'I'm no greenie, but I'm pretty bloody disgusted'.

'Someone's kid's toys, an old vacuum, some chairs, tables, old carpet underlay, lounge chairs, I think there's a bit of a mower over there.

'Wake up. I hope the people that are doing this watch this. I hope you have a good hard look in the mirror tonight before you got to bed and have a bit of a think about what you're doing. This isn't good enough.

'If you can afford to put petrol in your car, drive up here in the bush, waste half your day dumping this, you can afford to go to the local tip and pay about 25 or 30 bucks, depending on where you live, and dump it that way. This is wrong.'

Mr Shotton went on to say that the piles of waste continued for up to five kilometres down the track and implored viewers to spread awareness of the harmful impacts of illegal dumping.

'Share it, tell your mates. This has got to stop, we have to wake up at some point or another because it's bloody disgusting,' he said.

'Is it going to take the national parks and the government to lock up our bushland so that we can't get to it anymore?'

Local councils in NSW spend up to $50,000 each year cleaning up waste from illegal dumping and individuals can be fined up to $1500 on the spot.
