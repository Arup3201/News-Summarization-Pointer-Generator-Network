Education Minister Christopher Pyne lived up to his 'Mr Fixer' name live on air today, when he was challenged by Today show host Karl Stefanovic to change the tyre on Sylvia Jeffreys' car. 

The education minister proved that he knew more about mechanics that the crew of the morning show, when he took off his suit jacket and jacked up the car further, allowing him to get his hands dirty.

Mr Pyne's was labelled with the new nickname 'The Fixer' this week when he announced that he had backtracked on his controversial decision to cut 1700 research jobs.

It comes after Pyne failed to convince the Senate on Tuesday to pass his university reform laws this week for the second time, prompting requests from Labor for Pyne to be sacked 

Pyne has been attempting to overhaul the education system, introducing laws that would allow universities to set their own fees and financially penalise graduates who do not repay their student debts, reports Sydney Morning Herald.

Despite the second time failing to convince the Senate, Pyne has vowed he will never give up on his higher education campaign.

Speaking to Nine news, Pyne said: 'I never give up, no, I will not give up. It's too important to allow the Labor Party who are political opportunists and the Greens who are the same, to wreck this reform.'

During the show, Mr Pyne admitted if the higher education reform failed to be passed it could cause a double dissolution.

He has pledged to reintroduce higher education reforms after they were defeated in the Senate on Tuesday.

Stefanovic, who is the lovable rogue of the popular show was joined by Labor shadow minister for infrastructure Anthony Albanese during the segment and they didn't let Mr Pyne away lightly.

Karl Stefanovic told the minister that they were in 'need  of a little bit of a high' after the stressful week. 

'I think it was a little bit unreasonable that you were called 'Mr Fixit' this week, even though you labelled it yourself,' Stefanovic said, as he walked Mr Pyne to Today show co-host Sylvia Jeffreys' car. 

However Mr Pyne claimed that he was happy to be branded with the label and seemed up for the challenge ahead. 

'I'm happy to be regarded as The Fixer, I do fix things,I fix a lot of things around the house,' he said.

At the end of the segment, Stefanovic awarded the minister, saying 'well done Christopher Pyne, you can fix it'

'I fixed the curriculum, fixing teacher training, fixing independent public schooling, fixing parental engagement in schools, I mean the list is endless.'

Although things took an amusing turn when My Pyne was unable locate the nuts to secure the tyre to the car. 

'Where are the nuts?' Mr Pyne said, as he complained that he had to go straight to the airport after the segment with dirty hands. 

'It's not the first time he's said that,' Mr Albanese quipped from the background.
