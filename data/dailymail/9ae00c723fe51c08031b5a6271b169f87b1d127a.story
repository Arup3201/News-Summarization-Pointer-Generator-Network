Jermain Taylor has returned to jail after a judge revoked his bond for a previous arrest last August.

Taylor had been free after he pleaded not guilty to pointing a gun at a man's head and threatening to shoot three small children at an Arkansas parade on Monday.

Taylor, who holds the IBF middleweight champion, was arraigned the next day on charges of aggravated assault, endangering the welfare of a minor and marijuana possession. He was released on a $50,000 bond.

But Pulaski County Sheriff's Capt. Carl Minden says Taylor was rebooked into jail on Wednesday afternoon without bond after his bond was revoked in the August case.

Prosecutors say his arrest on the current charges shows he violated the terms of his release.

A message left with Taylor's attorney wasn't immediately returned Wednesday.
