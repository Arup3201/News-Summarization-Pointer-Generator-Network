Loved life: Alana Goldsmith was fun-loving, intelligent and successful, but she took her life at a train station in 2011 after fighting a long battle with anorexia nervosa

There were 'mistakes and failures' at the eating disorder clinic attended by a 23-year-old Sydney woman who committed suicide in 2011, a coroner found.

Alana Goldsmith attended the Wesley Eating Disorder Cline (WEDC) for treatment of an eating disorder she had suffered from since she was a teenager.

On July 22 2011, the day of her death, Alana left the hospital twice and was not seen by staff. She took her life at Summer HIll in Sydney's inner-west and was found dead hours after leaving for the final time.

The Goldsmith family requested an inquest following her death, to review patient care and explore the issues impacting eating disorder sufferers, carers and practitioners.

Magistrate Mark Douglass released a report into the events surrounding Ms Goldsmith's death on Monday, saying that Ms Goldsmith's treatment at WEDC was 'adequate but not optimal.'

'The unpredictable nature of suicide makes prevention difficult. The mistakes and failures at WEDC did not lead to Alana's death.'

In July 2011, a WEDC doctor was concerned that Ms Goldsmith's weight was in the moderately severe range of 42 kilograms.

Ms Goldsmith had been in and out of hospitals for two years dealing with her eating disorder before being admitted to the WEDC on July 18, 2011.

Alana (pictured right at Austrade awards ceremony with former Olympic swimmer Grant Hackett) killed herself in 2011 at the age of 23. The magistrate ruled today that while the Wesley Eating Disorder Clinic she was staying at had made 'mistakes and failures', they 'did not lead to Alana's death'

Judy Goldsmith, pictured at hospital with daughter Alana and baby Simone said Alana's delight at the arrival of her younger sister was typical of her 'joy' of life

'Not being aware that Alana twice left the WEDC on the day of her death until it was too late to initiate a response is also a failing and of concern,' Mr Douglass said.

'If staff had detected her absences, particularly her first absence, there would have been interventions and a change of her risk category that would have demanded regular checks perhaps at half-hour intervals.'

There was also a lack of professional rigour in maintaining attendance checks, he said.

'However, considering all of the evidence and detailed submissions, none of the failings were causative of Alana's death.'

Mr Douglass told Glebe Coroner's Court last month that it had been a 'complex and harrowing matter with many difficulties'.

Her family has said that Ms Goldsmith started wrestling with the illness when she was 15 and returned home from an exchange trip to Japan looking emaciated, but managed to hide it from her friends and family for many years.

Ms Goldsmith's family have spoken out about the mental illness, saying they want to challenge the perception that anorexia is just about being thin.

'Alana was a fun-loving, vivacious and intelligent young woman until anorexia nervosa starved her brain and destroyed her hopes and dreams,' her sister Simone Goldsmith said in July.

'This silent killer is a highly complex mental illness ... We hope that the findings handed down today bring about meaningful discussions ... that result in more resources and better care.'

In July, Alana's mother Judy Goldsmith posted about the inquest on the In Loving Memory of Alana Goldsmith Facebook tribute page Judy Goldsmith posted about the inquest.

'We were fortunate to have a very involved coroner who engaged with witnesses about the myriad issues impacting eating disorder sufferers, carers and practitioners,' she posted last month ahead of the initial findings.

'We feel positive that this gruelling process will bring about change... I was given the chance to address the court and go on record on behalf of the family.

'We wanted those present to hear about our fun-loving, clever, vivacious, multifaceted Alana. She is always in our hearts. And to those who continue to struggle, please hold onto hope.'

Butterfly Foundation CEO Christine Morgan said people with eating disorders need specialised treatment and early intervention.

'This is an illness that kills,' she said. 'It has the highest fatality rate of any mental illness and we cannot ignore that. We need to have effective treatment.

'We need significantly more resources ... we need more care that is in the community and psychologist and psychiatrists.'
