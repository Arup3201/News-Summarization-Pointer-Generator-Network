A teenager who weighed more than 21 stone had a £6,000 gastric bypass on the NHS because she was tormented by school bullies for being fat.

Emma Money, from Leeds, was told she had the health of someone who smokes 100 cigarettes a day.

She had the operation at just 16 years old after a two-year hunt to find a surgeon willing to do it.

The teenager, now 17, claims her weight, which reached 21st 6lbs, was down to a genetic condition passed down from her father.

Emma Money, 17, who tipped the scales at more than 21 stone has had a £6,000 gastric bypass on the NHS because she was tormented by school bullies for being fat

The genetic condition is a controversial topic among specialists and is so rare and hard to prove, that it doesn't even have a name.

It's now known that being obese can take years off your life and in some cases may be as dangerous as smoking.

Researchers at the University of Oxford  found that people who were moderately fat, with a BMI from 30 to 35, lost about three years of life.

Those who were morbidly fat, with a BMI above 40, lost about 10 years off their expected lifespan, similar to the effect of lifelong smoking. A healthy BMI is between 19 and 24.

The conclusions were drawn after they followed nearly one million people for an average of 10-15 years.

Moderately obese people were 50 per cent more likely to die prematurely than normal-weight people, said Gary Whitlock, the Oxford University epidemiologist who led the study.

He said that obese people were also two thirds more likely to die of a heart attack or stroke, and up to four times more likely to die of diabetes, kidney or liver problems. They were one sixth more likely to die of cancer.

Emma, who now weighs 15st after her surgery in January last year, said: 'Ever since primary school I've never felt accepted. I was terrorised and singled out, and I just didn't feel normal.

'When people are shouting, throwing things and pushing you around, it's hard to explain that you're fat because of genetics.

'I was upset and embarrassed because of my weight but the main reason I had the surgery was for my family. I wanted to reassure them that I will live a long, happy and healthy life.

'It hasn't been easy and many people have accused me of taking the easy choice out of this. But it has been tough, it has been painful, tiring and gruelling.'

Emma started thinking about surgery at 14-years-old after years of abuse at school. She had always eaten healthily and could not understand why she kept putting on weight.

Emma was physically abused by bullies at school who threw objects at her, and on one occasion, pushed her head into a wall.

The vicious assaults caused Emma to 
suffer from panic attacks, and she would fake illness to her mother Gwen
to avoid going to school.

At size 28, and after
two long years of visiting specialists who told her she was too young 
to have the surgery on the NHS, Emma found a surgeon in Sheffield 
willing to operate.

Consultant Surgeon Roger Ackroyd at BMI Thornbury Hospital in Sheffield said PARAPHRASE "As long as patients are post-pubertal there is no age limit for the surgery.

'Leeds Primary Care Trust sent Emma to me because I had experience of performing this surgery on adolescents. The surgeons in Leeds are extremely experienced bariatric surgeons but I don't think they had done any adolescents before.'

The gastric bypass operation was not 
performed on under 18s until a recent change in guidelines and is now 
only available for patients with a BMI of 40 or more.

The operation comes with a risk of bleeding, internal hernia and deep vein thrombosis.

Emma's stomach was divided and formed 
into a small pouch. Her bowel was then divided and brought up to join 
the pouch in a complete overhaul of her plumbing system.

Her
new stomach meant her food intake was restricted. She said: 'When I 
first woke up, I thought I was dying because of how much pain I was in -
It felt like I was being stretched.'

She spent three days in hospital recovering and it took a further six months for her stomach to get back to normal.

She
said: 'For months after the surgery, I didn't even notice I was losing 
weight but people kept telling me I looked great and a lot healthier.

'Then
I started to get a lot of support around school. It was so weird 
because the people who had bullied me were now apologising for what they
had done to me and offering to carry my bags.

'I'd never really had a group of friends before. Now, I do feel a lot more accepted.'

She now has a maximum of 1,000 calories a day and sticks to well-balanced healthy meals and tiny portions.

She said: 'Now I don't really think about kebabs or McDonald's because I know it will just make me poorly. I'm happy with a piece of fruit or some salad.'

Emma used to feel exhausted just 
leaving the house or going shopping but is happy now she can go out 
every weekend without getting tired.

She is still losing weight and hopes to drop another dress size.

After
seeing a documentary about a plus size pageant, Emma decided to enter 
Miss Teen Queen UK to inspire others - and she reached the second heat.

She said: 'it upset me so much when people judged me before they even knew my name.

'I hope that by participating in the beauty pageant will give other teenagers the strength to accept themselves the way they are and to always hold their heads high against bullies.

'I hope to inspire teenagers to always follow their hearts and achieve what they want to achieve and be who they want to be.

'I hope people will see the real me now, and I want them to understand that it's not easy. But above all, I hope to show the bullies that they are wrong. Now, I just feel like I can do anything.'
