Firms holding lucrative Whitehall contracts hired detective agencies accused of stealing private information, it emerged last night.

It means the ‘secret hacking scandal’ has now reached the doors of Government.

Last week, it emerged the country’s top crime-fighting agency had drawn up a list of 102 firms and individuals who employed corrupt private investigators.

It has not been made public but the Mail understands that, among the 102, are at least two big businesses paid to work for Government departments. Police hold a second list containing a further 200 names, suggesting this may be only the tip of the iceberg.

Scrutiny: Pressure is mounting on the Serious Organised Crime Agency to reveal the names of the law firms

Pressure is mounting on the Serious Organised Crime Agency to reveal the names of the law firms, insurers, banks and other big firms who used the services of the rogue private eyes.

Soca has handed the original list of 102 names to the Commons Home Affairs Committee but is insisting it remain confidential.

MPs want to find ways of publishing it, and will meet within weeks to discuss whether to use parliamentary privilege.

Yesterday, committee chairman Keith Vaz said the public are ‘left impotent in their judgment’ without the names of the firms involved, which are known to include a FTSE 100 company and global financial institutions.

He has written to several regulators to ask for clarification on what guidelines, if any, they issue to organisations in their industry on the use of private investigators.

They include the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, accountancy watchdog the ICAEW, the Office of Fair Trading and the Office of Rail Regulation.

As pressure mounts on Soca to publish the list, ministers will face demands to investigate the ties between the firms named in it and Government departments.

The Soca report was handed to ministers in 2008. It could prove hugely embarrassing if officials in sensitive departments have been oblivious to the fact they were handing taxpayers’ money to lawyers or other firms on the list.

Last night Tory MP James Clappison, a senior member of the Home Affairs Committee, wrote to the Cabinet Office calling for an audit of Whitehall’s dealings with the companies identified by Soca.

In a letter to Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude, he said reports have suggested the Soca list contains the names of law firms and other large organisations.

Mr Clappison wrote: ‘It could turn out to be the case that such firms and organisations on the list of clients of these private investigators have provided, and continue to provide, services to the Government.

‘In these circumstances, could I ask you what steps have been taken to ascertain if such firms and organisations have provided any services to the Government.

‘If they have, what steps have been taken to ascertain if such services have involved the use of these private investigators?’

Police have been criticised for trying to suppress the contents of the Soca list, effectively granting anonymity to the blue-chip companies on it. Soca says there is no proof the firms knew the detectives they employed were acting unlawfully.

But critics say the police response contrasts starkly with their treatment of the media while investigating phone hacking, when journalists were arrested in dawn raids on their homes.

Home Secretary Theresa May is expected to announce proposals this week that will require private detectives to have a licence to operate. Anyone found guilty of hacking or blagging – posing as someone to obtain personal information – would be barred.
