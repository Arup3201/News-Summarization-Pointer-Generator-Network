A stunning video shot by a GoPro camera attached to a drone is giving viewers a revealing behind-the-scenes glimpse of an airport like it has never been seen before.

The nearly four-minute video contains a series of fascinating scenes, including slow-motion shots of planes landing and taking off, overhead views of aircraft taxiing, and an air traffic control tower at sunrise.

The incredible footage was recorded by Postandfly at Mexico City International Airport after it was granted aerial access and the rare opportunity to fly a remote-controlled drone in close proximity to planes.
