Legislation to allow the birth of babies with genes from three biological parents should be put on hold because it is far riskier than previously thought, scientists warn.

MPs are due to vote on whether the UK should become the first country to legalise controversial ‘three parent babies’ after Government watchdog the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) gave it the go-ahead.

Advocates have compared the IVF technique, which involves inserting a small set of genes from a second mother, to ‘changing a battery’, saying it had no real impact on the baby’s core DNA.

But a growing number of scientists and MPs say new research indicates that such children’s genetic make-up could be affected far more profoundly than had been realised and they may develop unpredictable physical and mental character traits. They say that tests on animals have fuelled fears that people born using this technique – called mitochondrial DNA transfer – could also face problems such as reduced fertility, shorter lives, learning difficulties and cancer.

Even the respected New Scientist, which had backed the technique, last month called for more research, saying: ‘It appears we may have seriously underestimated the influence that mitochondria have. Research suggests they play a key role in some of the most important features of human life.

‘This raises the ethically troubling prospect – once widely dismissed – that children conceived in this way will inherit vital traits from three parents.’

The IVF technique involves taking the nucleus out of the egg of a mother likely to be carrying faulty mitochondria – the ‘batteries’ that power cells – transferring it into a healthy egg donated by another woman, resulting in a baby free from a range of devastating mitochondrial diseases. But it means the baby would contain genetic material not only from his or her mother and father but also from the donor. Mitochondria may have their own genes which would interact with matching DNA in the nucleus of the cell that could have a much larger impact on a child than has been believed.

Dr Edward Morrow, senior research fellow in evolution, behaviour and development at Sussex University, said the latest discoveries were ‘really important’, adding there was now ‘plenty of data suggesting we need to be more concerned than the authorities seem to be’.

Stuart Newman, professor of cell biology and anatomy at New York Medical College, said the proposed procedures would pair up different genes in an ‘arbitrary fashion’.

He said: ‘An analogy would be the engines of a Jaguar and a Rolls-Royce. Each car needs an engine, and the engine does the same thing in both cars. But things would go very wrong if you simply swapped them between the two cars. It is difficult to anticipate what developmental or physiological malfunctions would result from a mismatch.’

Tory MP Edward Leigh said the new research illustrated how ‘ill-prepared we are to interfere with the genetic make-up of human beings.

‘The rush towards legalising genetically modified babies must be halted in light of these new findings.’

But proponents of the IVF treatment said the benefits were huge and denied they were involved in ‘Frankenscience’. Prof Doug Turnbull, of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Mitochondrial Research at Newcastle University, said: ‘The risks are small compared to the risks those families face of having children with serious mitochondrial diseases.’

The HFEA, which ruled in July that the technique was ‘not unsafe’ and which will regulate the technique, said its expert panel has reviewed more research into the area ‘than any other body or group of scientists in the world’. It said many of the issues being raised had been considered and it can ‘see no reason for changing its in-depth views on this matter at this time’.
