The model girlfriend of footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has been criticised for her 'disrespectful and ignorant' decision to pose semi-naked for the Bring Back Our Girls campaign.

Irina Shayk, best known for featuring in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, posted pictures online supporting the campaign to rescue nearly 300 schoolgirls kidnapped in Nigeria.

The images show the 28-year-old Russian with just a piece of cardboard saying '#bring back our girls!!!' covering her semi-naked body.

Soon after the pictures appeared on her Facebook and Instagram pages, she faced a massive backlash, with her followers accusing the star of being disrespectful.

 been slammed for being "tasteless" on social media, after posting a 
topless snap in support of the #BringBackOurGirls campaign. Check it out

Referring to the 276 schoolgirls recently kidnapped by an Islamic 
terror group, the 28-year-old covered up her bits with a handmade sign 
in support of the cause… which saw her Insta-followers brand her as 
being "disrespectful".

One follower said: "Pretty tasteless and disrespectful. No class. 
This is exactly the justification terrorists are probably using to 
prevent women from receiving 'western education,' with another asking 
'Would you stand there naked wishing sorrow on the 9/11 victims? Would 
you do it for the tsunami? This is a tasteless attitude to 200 missing 
girls." Hmmm... looks like you should leave the sexy snaps for Sports Illustrated.
