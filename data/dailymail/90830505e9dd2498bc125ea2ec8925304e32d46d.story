It was a foregone conclusion that  HTC would use this year's Mobile World Congress to launch its latest handset, but the Taiwanese firm had something else up its sleeve. 

At the event in Barcelona the phone maker unveiled early details about a full-body virtual reality system it has developed in partnership with gaming giant Valve. 

The system, dubbed RE Vive, moves beyond just a headset and uses Kinect-style lasers to track even the smallest of body movements, letting players become fully immersed in their games.

Kinect is a system designed by Microsoft for use with its Xbox games consoles. 

The technology can read up to six skeletons at once and its 'small object detection' is said to be two-and-a-half times better.

This means it can identify small movements of the hand on a controller, for example.

HTC’s Vive has ‘full room scale’ and two wireless controllers with hand tracking.

A developer version will launch in the spring and the consumer model will go on sale later in the year.

The system is powered by the Oculus Rift technology and HTC will announce more information nearer the time of the developer launch.

HTC also used the event to unveil its 5-inch HTC One M9 phone with 20MP camera and a fitness band, in partnership with Under Armour. 

In particular, the M8's rear-facing 4 Ultrapixel camera has been added to the front of the M9, and the M9's rear camera has been upgraded to 20MP.

Ultrapixels are, for all intents and purposes, another name for megapixels. However, each individual pixel is marginally larger meaning they capture more light. 

In addition to the upgraded lenses, HTC has developed software called Dynamic Exposure designed around the human eye.

When a photo is taken on the One M9, this algorithm makes it appear as close to how the human eye would view it as possible, with the same light adjustment and focus. 

It also adds similar depth qualities, boosted by the dual camera the firm originally added on the M8.  

'I have previously struggled to buy into virtual reality when it consisted of sitting on a chair and simply looking around, but HTC’s Vive system has convinced me otherwise.

During the demonstration I was taken into a room that was empty except for a computer setup, the HTC Vive headset, two controllers and sensors on two of the walls.

These sensors use lasers to plot the room’s shape, size and obstacles.

For the demonstration version, the headset was attached to the computer using wires.

But the HTC spokesman told MailOnline this was because of the interference from the various networks covering the trade show and the final version will be wireless.

Once I put the headset on, a grid appeared around me similar to how the holodeck appears in Star Trek.

The demonstrator handed me the wireless controllers, which in itself was a strange experience to see controllers ‘floating’ towards you but not see the hands holding them.

I was then trained to use the controllers by blowing up a balloon with the left hand and punching it through the air with the right.

The first ‘experience’ dropped me underwater onto a sunken ship. Small fish swam around me, which I could ‘touch’ and move. I could look over the edge of the ship and explore the deck.

If at any point I approached a real-world obstacle, a feint grid would appear to warn me.

During this experience a virtual stingray swam near my face and a huge whale made me jump as it appeared on my left shoulder and cast a shadow over me.

Another experience involved painting in the air. Colours and brushes were selected with the left controller and painted with the right. These paintings hung in the air and I was able to walk through them. I also made snow fall around me.

A third involved exploring a kitchen, making a meal and serving it. At one point I dropped an egg near my foot and it broke and made a mess. I could use the controllers and triggers to pick up objects, move them around and drop them.

These skills were then put to the test during another experience in which I had to repair a robot.

While the final experience had me placed in the middle of a virtual battle. I could explore the battleground and kneel down so my face was in line with the ground.

I couldn't count the number of times I jumped, laughed, expressed surprise and was wowed by this technology.

And this is an early version, with a limited number of trials.

By these standards, this technology has the potential to live up to HTC’s claims of being revolutionary.

That said, there is one substantial benefit to having a stationary virtual reality experience compared to one you can explore and that’s convenience.

I can’t imagine many people have rooms they can dedicate entirely to this technology, or want to spend money on a host of kit, rather than just a headset.

As it stands though this technology literally took my breath away at times and was the stand out tech of this year’s Mobile World Congress.'

The 'full-body virtual reality system' was a surprise announcement at an event where HTC also unveiled it M9 handset and a fitness band. The M9 has added incremental changes compared to previous M8 (pictured) and these include taking the 4 Ultrapixel camera from rear of M8 and adding it to the front of the M9

Beside this, however, the changes between the HTC One M8 and M9 are incremental with the majority of tweaks being made to the operating system.

These include highly customisable themes and dynamic home screens. 

Using the phone's location, and by learning about a user's habits, the M9 will change which icons appear on the home screen throughout the day.

For example, if it knows the user is at home it will prioritise gaming and social network apps, but when it senses the user is near a tube or train station it will push the National Rail app - or similar - to the front. 

It only suggests apps that the user has already installed, and the suggestions can be customised or switched off completely. 

Elsewhere, the M9 is powered by the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon technology and features 3GB of RAM. 

It has 32GB of storage with the option to extend this using an SD card, plus all customers get 100GB Google Drive for two years. 

MailOnline's Victoria Woollaston reveals her first impressions of HTC's new device.

'There is little to get excited about with the One M9. 

'Its predecessors- the original One known as M7 and the One M8 - are well-made, well-built and were global successes.

'And the M9 is more of the same. 

'This means it has the same great design and feels comfortable to hold - so is far from a criticism - but it hardly warrants spending money to upgrade, especially from the M8. 

'The standout feature of the M9 is its cameras.

'HTC leads the way with smartphone cameras and has tapped into the growing trend of 'smartphone photography'. 

'By adding the 4Ultrapixel camera from the M8 to the front of the M9, it also understands its customers love of selfies. 

'Seeing the Dynamic Exposure in action does highlight how shots on iPhone and Android devices can sometimes fall short, but again, this isn't a reason to upgrade on its own. 

'Beyond that the innovations are minimal. 

'HTC prides itself on including features that add value rather than gimmicks, but without these there seems little incentive to switch - especially if you're a Samsung or Apple owner.

'Many of its software features, such as BlinkFeed and the new dynamic homescreen, will appeal to hardcore HTC fans, but may seem like bloatware to others.  

'That's not to say the phone is poor, and if an M7 owner is looking to upgrade then the M9 seems like an obvious choice. 

'But by tapping into its existing market rather than looking to expand, the handset may struggle to emulate its predecessors successes.'

The phone will be available from 31 March in three colours - 'gold on silver', 'gum metal grey on grey' and 'gold on gold.'

Prices are yet to be announced. 

HTC also used the event to launch its first fitness band in partnership with Under Armour. 

The partnership was announced in January and Under Armour’s team of designers, sports scientists and athletes have worked with HTC’s Connected Products to create the wearable. 

It will work with UA Record - an app that lets people record and analyse their activity levels from various other apps such as MyFitnessPal and Endomodo.  

The band  pairs with Android 4.3+ and iOS 7+ to also show phone notifications.

It will additionally respond to gestures to make it easier to control when exercising, for example. 

HTC said the band launch in the US later this year and the company is 'evaluating' it in Europe. 

Again, no price details were given. 

The M9's rear camera has been upgraded to 20MP. In addition to the new lenses, HTC has developed software called Dynamic Exposure designed to mimic the human eye. When a photo is taken this algorithm adjusts exposure, focus and depth accordingly. This is boosted by the dual-lens setup added on the M8 (shown)

Beside the camera updates, the differences between the HTC One M8 and M9 are incremental, with the majority of tweaks being made to the operating system. Many of the leaked specifications (pictured) before the event have been confirmed including 3GB of RAM, screen size, operating system and processor
