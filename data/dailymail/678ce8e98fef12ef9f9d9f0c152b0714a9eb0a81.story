Rafael Marquez made history on Friday by becoming the first player to captain his nation in four World Cup tournaments.

The 35-year-old led Mexico out for their opening Group A fixture against Cameroon in Natal to set the new record after previously competing in the 2002, 2006 and 2010 finals.

Former Barcelona and Monaco centre-back Marquez, who now plays for Leon in his homeland, made his international debut way back in 1997 and collected his 121st cap in the Cameroon match.

He was first handed the captain's armband by Javier Aguirre in the 2002 finals at the young age of 23 and started in all four matches before they lost 2-0 to the United States in the last 16.

It was not an occasion Marquez would care to remember - he was shown a red card for a deliberate mid-air headbutt on Cobi Jones late in the match.

At the 2006 World Cup in Germany, Marquez played in all three of Mexico's group matches and scored the goal in their 2-1 loss to Argentina in the second round.

He had left Barcelona for the New York Red Bulls by the time of the 2010 tournament in South Africa but was still given the captain's armband.

Marquez scored in their 1-1 draw with the hosts and assisted in Javier Hernandez's strike in the 2-0 win over France, before Mexico were once again eliminated by Argentina in the knockout stages.

Despite few tipping Mexico to advance to the latter stages of the tournament in Brazil, Marquez is confident Mexico can make an impact.

'This is a window for all of us, for many of the players it's a huge opportunity to raise their level and for others to see us play,' he said.

'You don't get many chances to do that. That's what I always tell the lads.

'Our group is strong and in our minds we believe we can make it all the way to the final and make history.'
