Manchester City defender Pablo Zabaleta has backed his fellow Argentine Angel di Maria to be a big success at rivals Manchester United following his British record £59.7m move from Real Madrid.

The 26-year-old has swapped a La Liga title push for an altogether different challenge at Old Trafford, as they look to recover from a disastrous start to the season and push for a top four place.

The latest setback, a 4-0 thumping at MK Dons in the Capital One Cup, leaves United in a early season crisis already, with new manager Louis van Gaal weighing up whether to throw both Di Maria and other new signing Marcos Rojo into his squad for the game at newly-promoted Burnley on Saturday.

Faith: Pablo Zabeleta believes both Angel Di Maria and Marcos Rojo will be successes at Manchester United

Historic: Di Maria will look to follow in the footsteps of previous No 7's Eric Cantona and Cristiano Ronaldo

Zabaleta has no doubt in his mind that the former Real Madrid winger will be a star at United, with his top-level experience set to aid United significantly this season. 

He told the Daily Star: 'All the Argentinians are coming and taking over Manchester now!

'Di Maria and Rojo are on the other side, though. I am very pleased for both of them because I know them very well.

'With Di Maria, United have signed one of those players that every single club in the world would like to sign.

'He has been at Real Madrid and has won a lot of trophies - he's won the Champions League and has great experience there. He's a great player, he's fast, he's direct, sets up goals and can score them.'

All smiles: Louis van Gaal will be hoping for Angel di Maria to make an instant impact at Manchester United

Welcoming: Van Gaal sits alongside Di Maria as the latter is unveiled at a press conference on Thursday

All smiles: Marcos Rojo signed for Manchester United for £16million from Sporting Lisbon

Zabaleta's last came up against Di Maria when Real and City were drawn in the same Champions League group in 2012 - with the Galaticos picking up four points from the two games. 

So the 29-year-old is chomping at the bit to square up with him again at the Etihad Stadium when the two Manchester rivals face each other on November 2. 

He added: 'That will be interesting (the derby game). We'll see where Van Gaal is going to play him, where he fits into that system. I've seen him play in different positions - not just as a winger - so we'll see.

'I'll look forward to going up against him. We are friends, we'll always be friends off the field but not in that game.'
