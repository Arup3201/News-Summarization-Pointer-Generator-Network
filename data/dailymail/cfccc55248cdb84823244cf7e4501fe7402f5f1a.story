A Sydney kindergarten teacher who was returning from her German homeland on the doomed Malaysia Airlines plane has been described as 'the most selfless person'.

Gabriele Lauschet has been identified as NSW's sixth victim on flight MH17, which crashed in Ukraine.

The 47-year-old was flying back to Sydney for the new school term at the German International School in Terrey Hills.

Ms Lauschet had taught at the school for 15 years.

In March Ms Lauschet had become engaged to another staff member at the school, Andreas Schaaf, after she proposed to him.

The couple lived together with her adult son Tim, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Friends and colleagues were shocked to hear of her death.

'There are no words to describe your loss dear Gaby, you sure brighten many lives on your path and will do for years to come. You leave us love and respect for life. Will miss you immensely,' Joel, from Sydney, wrote on Facebook.

'Shocking, can't believe she will not be in school on Monday. Will miss her greatly,' wrote Gudrun Daniels.

Antje Eildermann wrote: 'I so agree with all of you. She touched and brightened my/our life, the most selfless person I ever got to know.'

The new school term starts on Wednesday.

The teachers' planning day has been cancelled and staff have been offered support and counselling.
