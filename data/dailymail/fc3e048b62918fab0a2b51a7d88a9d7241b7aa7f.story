The Catholic Church has taken a 'step in the right direction' by holding talks on how to provide better spiritual care to homosexual members, gay rights activists said today.

Following Pope Francis' famous 'Who am I to judge?' comment on homosexuality last year, bishops have repeatedly spoken of the need to change the church's language towards gays from words of moral condemnation and judgment, to words of welcome and respect.

Now for the first time a Vatican meeting is discussing gay and lesbian issues within the Church - a move described as 'a crack in the ice that we have been waiting for, for a very long time' by the Catholic gay rights group New Ways Ministry.

Despite their apparent softening on the issue, the Vatican's top canon lawyer was keen to make clear that the ongoing discussions will not focus on changing the Church's doctrine on homosexuality, nor will it lead to an endorsement of gay marriage or even gay unions.

But the decision to include gay and lesbian issues at a meeting discussing Catholic family values bears all the hallmarks of the progressive attitude the Church has adopted under Pope Francis.

On the other hand the last pope, Benedict XVI, penned some of the modern Catholic Church's key documents opposing homosexuality when he was head the Vatican's orthodoxy office in the 1980s.

'I think what we're seeing is a crack in the ice that we have been waiting for, for a very long time,' said Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry. 'It's a sign of a first step.'

Church teaching holds that gay acts are 'intrinsically disordered,' sinful and a 'serious depravity,' and that homosexual inclination is 'objectively disordered.' At the same time, it says homosexuals themselves must be treated with respect and compassion and not suffer discrimination.

'I know scores of people who have left the Catholic Church because of those words,' DeBernardo said.

Progressive: The Vatican synod is discussing gay and lesbian issues within the Church for the first time. The move has been described as 'a crack in the ice' by the Catholic gay rights group New Ways Ministry

Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI penned some of the Vatican's key documents on gays when he headed the Vatican's orthodoxy office; a 1986 letter of his to bishops on providing pastoral care to gays insisted that any church program must clearly state 'that homosexual activity is immoral.' 

His 2003 document opposing same-sex unions made clear that 'there are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to God's plan for marriage and family.'

The Vatican's top canon lawyer, Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio, yesterday said that the Catholic Church would 'never' accept gay marriage or even bless a gay union.

Despite that unbending position, there's no doubting that a shift in tone has occurred.

Michael Brinkschroeder, co-president of the European Forum of LGBT Christian Groups, said  it was clear that the synod won't change doctrine, but that the 'Francis effect' appeared to be trickling down to local bishops. 

Many had 'lost their fear' and are freer now to engage in dialogue with gays in a way they couldn't under the last two popes, he said.

'With Benedict vanished from the scene, Francis has given signals for bishops to start pastoral work and dialogue,' he said.

Pope Francis famously said 'Who am I to judge?' when asked in 2013 about rumors that a top priestly adviser had a gay lover.

DeBernardo, of New Ways Ministry, said the next step is for gays to be at the table offering their testimony to bishops. 

No openly gay Catholics have addressed the closed-door synod, but two Catholic heterosexual couples have spoken about experiences of devout Catholics welcoming gays or trying to provide pastoral care for them.

He said he was 'euphoric' that some bishops had said language such as 'intrinsically disordered' was wholly ineffective in bringing people closer to the church.

Not so fast, say conservative Catholics.

Hard-line Cardinal Raymond Burke, who heads the Vatican's high court, insisted that gay sex was and will remain 'intrinsically disordered' and children must be protected from thinking otherwise.

He was responding to testimony from an Australian Catholic couple who told the synod about friends who welcomed their gay son and his partner to a Christmas party.

'That particular form of relationship should not be imposed upon family members, and especially upon impressionable children,' Burke told the conservative LifeSiteNews.

 'And I urge parents or grandparents - whoever it may be - to be very, very prudent in this matter and not to scandalize their children or grandchildren.'
