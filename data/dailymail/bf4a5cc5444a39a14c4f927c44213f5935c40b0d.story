The Israeli army has deployed a missile defence system near the Lebanese border, just days after its warplanes shot down an unidentified unmanned aircraft.

The Patriot surface-to-air missile was deployed from Israel's northern city of Haifa, an army spokesman said today.

He refused to say if the battery's deployment came in response to Saturday's drone, which was widely believed to have originated in Lebanon.

The drone has been link to Lebanon's 
militant group Hezbollah, which has advanced Iranian weapons and has 
deployed similar aircraft in the past.

Israel has deployed Patriots in Haifa during its war with Hezbollah in 2006 and on other occasions.

The Israeli Defence Force yesterday 
released video showing the moment its jets intercepted the mystery drone
that crossed into the Jewish state's airspace from the Mediterranean 
Sea yesterday.

The rogue drone, highlighted in red in these pictures, was intercepted flying above the Negev desert in the south of the country and shot down by an Israeli fighter jet.

A military spokeswoman said nobody was injured when the jet was brought down in the south of the country.

Lieutenant Colonel Avital Leibovich said Israeli systems on the ground alerted the air force to the drone during the morning.

She
said it flew over the Gaza Strip but did not originate from the 
Palestinian territory, prompting the country to launch an investigation 
into the drone's starting point.

Lt Col Leibovich did not give more details, but Israeli media reported that it might have been an intelligence gathering drone sent to investigate their Dimona nuclear reactor - and that it was not carrying explosives.

Israeli jets scrambled to intercept the unmanned aircraft that crossed into their airspace from the Mediterranean Sea, a military spokeswoman said

It was not clear where the drone originated but military officials said it did not appear to have taken off from Gaza

She claimed the Israeli Air Force was in control throughout.

'We had monitoring contact from the ground and from the air,' she added.

'We alerted jet planes that escorted 
the unmanned aerial vehicle and due to some operational considerations 
we decided to intercept the unmanned aerial vehicle in the northern 
Negev area, which has no population.'

Iran-backed Lebanese militia Hezbollah has launched several drones into Israel over the past few years, including the Iranian-made drone that was shot down in 2006.

Another one launched two years earlier crashed in the Mediterranean.

Relations between Israel and Iran are strained with tensions particularly high over Tehran's nuclear programme, which the West believes is intended for atomic weapons.

Tehran insists its atomic program is for peaceful purposes only.

Israel has hinted that military action should be taken to prevent Iran from getting nuclear bombs.

Lt Col Leibovich would not elaborate how the unmanned vehicle was brought down but said troops were searching for debris from the drone.

Defence Minister Ehud Barak congratulated the military in a statement, saying: 'We view this incident of attempting to enter Israeli airspace very severely and we will consider our response later.'
