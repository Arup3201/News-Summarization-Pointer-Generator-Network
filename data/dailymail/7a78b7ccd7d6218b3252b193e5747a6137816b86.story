A British expat fined for damaging a car he landed on when he fell from a first floor window claimed he had been chasing a parrot.

The expat salesman was trying to catch the bird, which was flapping around inside his office in Dubai, but ended up plummeting towards the road below when a glass window he was leaning on smashed.

The man, 29, who suffered cuts to his hands and face and fractured his wrist in the fall, landed on a car belonging to an Indian engineer and dented its bonnet.

But his ordeal did not end there, with prosecutors charging him with accidentally causing damage to the Ford Focus rental car parked outside the office in the Al Quoz area.

The man was fined 2,000 dirham (£340) today after admitting the offence at the Dubai Misdemeanor Court and has 15 days to appeal.

The engineer, 28, told the court security men had rushed into his office to tell him a man had fallen onto his car.

The engineer added: 'I discovered that the defendant fell on my vehicle once I went out to check out what happened. The hood was completely damaged.

'Police had arrived at the scene and an ambulance car rushed the injured defendant to hospital.'

Gulf News reported the man had claimed to have leaned on the 'frail' glass when it smashed into tiny pieces, causing him to lose his balance.

He added: 'I landed on a car and sustained several injuries. I was not at fault. It was an accident. The glass in the window was made from poor material.'
