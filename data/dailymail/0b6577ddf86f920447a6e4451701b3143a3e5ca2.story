An equestrian eventer has died after being crushed under his horse as he fell on the approach to a jump at a cross-country race event.

Experienced rider Tom Gadsby, 26, was competing alongside Olympic riders in a one star cross-country race when he was thrown from his horse, The Drover.

Paramedics rushed to his side but were unable to save the New Zealander, who was pronounced dead at the scene.

All further trials at the Somerford Park International Horse Trials being held at the River Dane valley site in Congleton, Cheshire, were abandoned following his death.

The ambulance service today said the cause of his death was a cardiac arrest.

TV presenter Clare Balding led an outpouring of sympathy following the shock, describing the death on Twitter as 'devastating news' and 'just awful'.

Jim Ellis, chief executive of Equestrian Sports New Zealand (ESNZ), said: 'On behalf of ESNZ members I express our sincerest condolences to Tom's family and close friends.

'Tom was a talented showjumper and 
eventer who was in Europe to fulfil his dream of competing as a 
professional event rider - a dream he achieved but which has been 
tragically cut short.

'He had high hopes of representing New Zealand at the top level of the sport.'

Mike Etherington-Smith, chief executive of British Eventing, the sport's governing body, said: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with Tom's family at this really sad time.'

Mr Gadsby, who came to the UK last year to ride for top international eventer Tiny Clapham at her stables near Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, was riding seven-year-old skewbald gelding The Drover when he was thrown on the approach to fence 4b just before 2.20pm on Sunday.

British Eventing, Equestrian Sports New Zealand and the International Equestrian Federation have confirmed the death will be investigated.

Mr Gadsby was from Kerikeri, about three hours north of Auckland in New Zealand and had competed for many years at grand prix-level showjumping, including two years in Germany.

He changed back to eventing last year and had hoped to compete for New Zealand in the Olympics, ESNZ have said.

A spokesman for Cheshire Police said: 'At 3pm today, police were called to an incident at an equestrian event in the area of Somerford, Congleton, to a report of a rider having fallen from his horse.

'Sadly, it was confirmed that a 26-year-old male had been pronounced dead at the scene... in what appears to be a tragic accident.'

Professional riders have paid tribute to Mr Gadsby, with one friend describing him as a 'very special guy with a huge heart'.

International event rider Emily Baldwin wrote on Twitter: 'Horrific news from Somerford. Once again it's a reminder of how precious this life is and how real the risks are in our wonderful sport.'

Event rider Ginny Howe tweeted: 'Absolutely devastated to hear the news from @somerfordpark . I just can't believe it. Thoughts go out to all friends and family.'
