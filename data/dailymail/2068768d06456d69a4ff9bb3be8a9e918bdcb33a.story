Pictured: Alexian Lien drove through a swarm of motorcyclists in his SUV on a New York City highway, apparently in fear of his safety and that of his wife and 5-month-old baby

Video has emerged showing the shocking moment a Range Rover driver apparently drove through a crowd of motorbikes as it fled with its family inside for fear of being attacked.

Police have revealed the bikers started to damage the vehicle after the driver, 33-year-old Alexian Lien, hit a motorcyclist.

Fearing for the safety of his wife Roslyn Ng and young child, aged five months, the SUV driver then sped off, hitting several bikers in its path.

The six-minute film shows the SUV hit another motorcyclist after it was chased by the pack of bikers.

The
 family are eventually brought to a standstill in Manhattan traffic and 
immediately bikers run to attack the vehicle, smashing the driver's 
window and attempting to smash the rear door window.

The five-month-old child was in the back and Ng was in the front passenger seat.

An
 NYPD spokesman told MailOnline the Lien 
was taken to hospital and treated for lacerations to his face and body.

He said there were no other injuries reported from the incident.

No one has been arrested and police are still investigating and examining the evidence, he said.

The moment Alexian Lien fled from a pack of motorcyclist, dramatically taking out several in its path

The bikers had been riding alongside the Range Rover before the incident. Shortly after this moment, the biker in blue jeans directly front of the car braked, it appeared the vehicle may have hit it

Swarm: The massive group then ground to a halt and surrounded the vehicle

The
 spokesman said, according to Lien, a large number of 
motorcyclists were driving 'erratically' and he 'accidentally collided 
with one'.

The footage shows one motorcyclist brake hard in front the the car and seems to get bumped by it.

He
 pulled over but some of the bikers started to damage the vehicle. The 
NYPD spokesman told  MailOnline the driver drove off 'to avoid an 
impending assault'.

The video shows the Range Rover accelerate suddenly knocking over bikes and motorcyclists, driving over the top of them.

The
 footage was captured on a helmet camera of a motorcyclist during an 
annual bikers' event in New York City, at around 2pm yesterday.

Apparently intimidated, the driver then accelerates away knocking down bikers in its path

Bikers watch in disbelief as the 4x4 driver speeds off by going straight through their group

The chase is on: It only takes a few seconds before the front running bikers, including the one filming, catch up with the Range Rover

Caught: Within minutes, the whole pack has caught up with the vehicle, with Lien, Ng, and their 5-month-old inside

Lien speeds away, but immediately the angry bikers follow and it takes a matter of seconds for them to catch up.

The footage shows them following the vehicle for several minutes, at times getting close and intimidating the driver.

The
 group of bikers take Exit 14, on route 95, following signs for the 
Cross Bronx Expressway and passing the sign for Henry Hudson Parkway, 
before they traffic begins to slow.

The bikers again surround the vehicle, blocking its path and it's forced to stop.

Seizing
 an opportunity to confront the driver, one biker dismounts and tries to
 open the door, but the SUV speeds off again, knocking down at least one
 more motorcyclist.

Halted: The bikers surround the vehicle forcing it to stop, and another biker seized the opportunity to try to get into the driver's side door

The driver speeds off again, knocking down another motorcyclist

The
 driver heads off on route 95 heading north towards the Cross Bronx 
Expressway, then taking the W 176 SI which leads into a built-up area 
with heavy traffic.

Forced
 to stop at traffic lights, the Range Rover comes to a standstill, and 
within seconds two bikers are off their vehicles and attacking the 
driver's side windows.

The
 first takes off his helmet and throws it against the driver's door 
window, smashing it; the second tries to punch through the rear door 
window, where the child was sat.

The footage then stops.

The
 video was posted by a biker, under the name GIXXARDR on Liveleaks, from
 Melbourne, Australia, this morning. He claims one biker was killed, 
which the police said was not true.

When they come to a standstill in heavy traffic, it takes moments before a biker jumps off and attacks the vehicle, smashing the driver's window with his helmet

A second driver also tries to smash the back window, then the footage abruptly ends

Already it has received numerous comments, most are in support of Lien.

One
 person, whose profile name is Sgt Pepper, says:  'I would do exactly 
the same thing. They're intimidating him and he's probably fearing for 
his life.'

Another, known as 'zacarra' says the driver acted in 'self defense'.

'Did
 you see the biker break (sic) check him in the beginning. This poor guy
 was running for his life from the start,' zacarra writes.

According
 to 'meathead12' it was 'justifiable': 'Only a fool would stick around 
to be pulled out of his car and lynched by 100 bikers.'

'charlesferg' says the NYC has now banned the riders' annual event.
