A little league football coach has been arrested after police say he stepped off the sidelines of a tied game and struck a 13-year-old boy on the opposing team giving him a concussion.

Nathan Harris, 38, is accused of intentionally stepping on the field during Saturday’s game in Payson, Utah and knocking the boy unconscious to the supporting claim of outraged witnesses and released video.

'He actually stepped in, folded his arms and went up under his chin and just flattened him,' the boy's mother who wished to not be identified told KENS 5.

Unexpected hit: A little league football coach has been arrested after police say this video shows him stepping off the sidelines of a tied game and knocking an opposing 13-year-old player unconscious

Booked: The coach, 38-year-old Nathan Harris has been released from jail on bond after arrested for second-degree felony child abuse

'No only did he hit him, but he shows no remorse afterwards like, tries to help him up, tries to do anything. He just steps back out of the field and stands there,' Sgt Lance Smith of the Payson police department told the station.

Harris hasn't been charged, but police in Payson — about an hour south of Salt Lake City — have arrested him for investigation of second-degree felony child abuse.

Harris' Attorney Dean Zabriskie says it was an accident, but one on the boy's end.

'I cannot see in any way that that video would indicate that there was any time to make a decision ... the boy crosses the line, our client puts his arms up and that's all you can see on the tape,' Mr Zabriskie told KENS 5.

He says police are relying too heavily
on the grainy video along with testimony from witnesses who were 
standing far away and he adds were 'of course representing the opposite 
team.'

Sgt Smith says the boy, who's described as one of the area's star players - having made 18 touchdowns this season - will miss a month of playing time in result of his injury.
