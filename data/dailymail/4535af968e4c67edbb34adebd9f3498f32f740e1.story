Watch out ladies or you might just become smitten with the 'coolest kid in the whole wide world'.

That's the view of many after Keano, six, took his mother's iPad and filmed himself showing off his muscles and abs. 

His mother, Caitlin Gahleitner, from Perth, Western Australia, then promptly shared the clip online.

The result is an adorable video that has gone viral with over 8,000 likes since it was uploaded to Facebook by radio station 2DayFM on Wednesday.

'Hello girls, my name's Keano,' the mini-Romeo begins in a gentlemanly fashion.

'I hope you see my muscles and my abs,' he then says, flexing his biceps.

Giving his viewers plenty of time to admire his stomach, Keano then lifts up his shirt for the camera and, pointing towards his belly, chimes 'see, babes? They're called abs'.

'I'm the coolest kid in the whole wide world,' he continues, before blowing a kiss to the screen.

'I hope you love me!'

Viewers clearly did fall in love with the year one student, who received well over 8000 likes for his video and more than 1000 shares.

Almost three thousand people commented on the clip, most of them comparing Keano to their own friends or complimenting him on his physique. 

His mother, Caitlin Gahleitner, told Daily Mail Australia that his inspiration came from his father.

The video has since received over 8000 likes and 1000 shares since being uploaded on Wednesday 

'His dad goes to the gym every day and always says to him, "look, I'm getting some abs!",' Ms Gahleitner said, adding: 'Like father, like son!'

However, Keano is not as keen about his new-found fame as the rest of his family members are, as Ms Gahleitner admits his aunts and uncles now incessantly ask him 'how's your abs, Keano?'

'We all tease him about it now and he gets embarrassed, he just keeps saying "I don't want to be famous!",' Ms Gahleitner said. 

'I can't wait until his 21st birthday!'
