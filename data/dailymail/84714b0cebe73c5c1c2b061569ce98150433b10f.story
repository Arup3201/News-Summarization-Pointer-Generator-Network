Arrested: John Thomas Cormier Jr (pictured) was arrested Monday on charges he murdered his 3-month-old son

A young 21-year-old father  was indicted Monday on charges he murdered his 3-month-old son.

John Thomas Cormier Jr's  arrest comes exactly three months after his infant son was found unresponsive at the Lebanon, Tennessee home he shared with the boy's mother. 

An investigation was launched after the incident, and the case was recently brought in front of a grand jury, which decided to indict Cormier on charges of first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse. 

Emergency responders arrived at an apartment on 1701 Summerfield Drive on August 18, after receiving a call that a 3-month-old boy was unresponsive.

Cormier's son was rushed to University Medical Center, but it was too late and he was pronounced dead.  

Lebanon Police Chief Scott Bowen has not commented on the case, or the condition the child was in when they found him. 

The Department of Children's Services is also investigating the case. 

Cormier is currently being held in Wilson County Jail on $250,000 bail.
