Children in Britain are less likely to grow up living with both parents than in almost any other country in the Western world.

Just two thirds are still living in the same household as their natural mother and father by the age of 14.

Only in Latvia, Estonia and Belgium are children more likely to grow up outside the traditional nuclear family, according to research by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

While 68.9 per cent of British children aged up to 14 live with both their parents, in the US the figure is 70.7 per cent and in France 79.5 per cent.

The UK proportion is also much lower than Germany on 82 per cent.

Finnish children are most likely still to be living with both parents, at 95.2 per cent.

Critics say the figures demonstrate the declining importance of marriage in the UK compared with our neighbours – and called on ministers to implement tax breaks for married couples.

Marriage rates have more than halved in the past 40 years, while the number of lone-parent households increased by an average of 26,000 a year from the early 1980s to 2010.

Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, pointed to evidence that children tend to enjoy better life outcomes when the same two parents are able to give them support and protection throughout their childhood.

Figures show that 28 per cent of children in lone-parent families live in relative poverty, compared with 17 per cent for couple families.

Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘When families are strong and stable, so are children – showing higher levels of wellbeing and more positive outcomes. But when things go wrong – either through family breakdown or a damaged parental relationship – the impact on a child’s later life can be devastating.

‘We have already invested £30million in relationship support, to prevent family breakdown rather than waiting to pick up the pieces.

‘Across Government we’re working to improve the support available for families who experience abuse at home by more effectively punishing the perpetrator and doing more to educate young people about domestic violence.’

Norman Wells, from the pressure group Family and Youth Concern, said: ‘Children born to cohabiting parents are much more likely to see their parents separate than those born to married parents, and with almost half of births now taking place outside marriage rates of family breakdown look set to remain high.

‘With family breakdown costing the taxpayer an estimated £44billion per year, the Government should be unashamedly promoting the benefits of marriage and creating a climate which encourages couples to get married and stay married. 

‘Most other European countries recognise marriage in the tax system, but in the UK the Government has been dragging its feet over fulfilling its coalition agreement pledge to introduce transferable tax allowances for married couples. 

‘The Government should put that right without further delay and, at the same time, needs to start overhauling a benefits system that incentivises lone parenthood. For too long, government policy has pretended that all types of family structure are of equal value to society.’

The figures are contained in a ‘family database’ published by the OECD, which represents the world’s industrialised countries. They refer to 2007 – the latest year in which a comparison is possible.

Across the organisation, which is mainly comprised of countries in Europe, North America and Australasia, an average of 84.1 per cent of children are still living with both parents at the age of 14.

Stability: Mr Duncan Smith said: 'When families are strong and stable, so are children'

The only countries below the UK on the league table are Latvia on 64.9 per cent; Estonia on 66.8 per cent; and Belgium on 65.0 per cent.

However, the proportion is far higher in countries such as Italy (92.1 per cent), Spain (91.5 per cent) and Turkey (91.5 per cent).

The family database confirmed that the UK has the highest proportion of children living in a single-parent household in western Europe – and is behind only the United States and Estonia in the OECD. Some 22.9 per cent of British children aged up to 14 are living with a lone parent, compared with only 9.2 per cent in Italy.

In Germany the proportion is 13.4 per cent, and in France 13.3 per cent. Across the OECD the average is 15.9 per cent. Britain is beaten only by Estonia (24 per cent) and the United States (25.8 per cent).

Christian Guy, managing director of the Centre for Social Justice, said the league table proved that ministers needed to recognise marriage in the tax system.

‘Timid politicians are becoming numb to Britain’s sky-high family breakdown rates,’ he said.

‘Behind too many front doors family instability damages adults and children. Yet, as these OECD figures show, broken families are not some inevitable feature of modern society or “social progress”. 

‘All kinds of transformational help can be offered to parents and couples when they come under life’s pressures. 

‘It is time for people who oppose things that would stem the tide of breakdown, such as backing marriage as the most stable path for children, to stop playing politics. Our forgotten families need all the help we can offer.’
