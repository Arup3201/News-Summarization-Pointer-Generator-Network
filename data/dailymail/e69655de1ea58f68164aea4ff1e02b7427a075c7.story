Lawrence Springborg has won a party room ballot to lead the Liberal National Party in Queensland.

His deputy will be John-Paul Langbroek.

Mr Springborg and Mr Langbroek jointly contested for respective leader and deputy against several other contenders.

Outgoing transport minister Scott Emerson, outgoing parliamentary speaker Fiona Simpson and outgoing housing minister Tim Mander had also put their hats in the ring for the leadership.

However, Mr Springborg and Mr Langbroek, both former opposition leaders, emerged as the winners after a two-hour ballot.

The decision is expected to gain the support of two crossbenchers, Katter's Australian Party MPs Rob Katter and Shane Knuth, who are yet to decide which major party to support to form minority government.

The party was left leaderless after Premier Campbell Newman lost his seat of Ashgrove at last week's election.

Mr Newman is still caretaker premier because Labor and the LNP have both failed to gain a majority in the 89-seat parliament.

The LNP has 39 seats and remains ahead of Labor in three of four undecided seats.

Labor has so far won 43 seats and has the backing of Independent MP Peter Wellington, giving it a total of 44 seats.

With four seats still in doubt - Maryborough, Ferny Grove, Whitsundays, and Mt Ommaney - Labor needs to gain at least one more to win the race to govern.
