Hungry space explorers need to act fast when they get the urge for a snack, if this NASA footage is anything to go by.

The video clip captured on board the International Space Station reveals what happens when a tin of mixed nuts is opened in zero gravity.

As astronaut Chris Hadfield partially peels back the foil lid, the nuts can be seen floating around inside the tin ready to escape.

A very light snack: The nuts can be seen floating around inside the tin in the video clip captured in zero gravity on board the International Space Station

The
flight engineer quickly replaces the foil over the tin to prevent the 
jostling almonds, cashews and peanuts from drifting in all directions on the giant floating laboratory.

But not before one pesky nut escapes the tin, which Commander Hadfield manages to cling on to.

Commander Hadfield recently began a 
five month stint on board the International Space Station, and is due to
become the first Canadian to take overall control of the station in 
March.

The social 
media-savvy astronaut regularly tweets about his adventures hundreds of 
miles above the earth, and has more than 280,000 Twitter followers.

Meanwhile Commander Chris Hadfield, 53, has posted hundreds of breathtaking images on his Twitter account since joining the crew as part of Expedition 34 just a few weeks ago.

As
well as San Francisco's famous landmark, Commander Hadfield - who has 
described the shifting view of the earth from windows of the space 
station as 'a perpetual magnet' - has snapped the bright lights of 
Manhattan at night, the 'endless' golden beaches of Australia, a vivid 
blue river snaking through Brazilian farmland, and 'cauliflower' clouds 
sitting over the Amazon rainforest.
