Chipotle has been forced to apologize after a slew of racist tweets and offensive posts attacking the American government were sent out to its hundreds of thousands of followers by hackers.

The avatar of the Burrito bar's Twitter account was changed to a swastika and a number of tweets posted by hackers on Sunday morning contained pro-Nazi messages.

Other posts, littered with swear words, attacked the American government and used racist language to target Barack Obama. 

Mexican grill Chipotle was forced to apologize to its hundreds of thousands of followers after hackers posted a stream of offensive, racist and pro-Nazi tweets from the account and changed its avatar to a Swastika

Some of the tweets also said that Chipotle would be closing because the food had been poisoned. 

The company posted a message on Sunday apologizing for the slew of offensive posts.

It said: 'We apologize for the very offensive messages sent out from our account earlier tonight. We were unfortunately hijacked temporarily. -Joe.' 

The profile of the account was changed by hackers, pointing to two accounts @TUGFeds and @TheCeltic666, which have now been suspended. 

The offensive tweets were posted after Chipotle's official twitter account was hacked at the weekend 

Many of the tweets were laden with swear words and directed criticism at the American government and FBI

A number of the messages targeted the American government with messages, littered with insults. 

In one of the offensive posts the hackers posted: 'F*** the government and the FBI, ur all frauds that line ur pockets, hahahaha losers, f*** you all.' 

Another said the company was now a supporter of the Nazi party. 

Chipotle is to investigate how the hack happened

Many of the more than 600,000 followers of the fast food chain's account realized it had been hacked and re-posted some of the offensive messages on Sunday. 

Another message said: '#Dramaalert @KEEMSTARx The meat has been poisoned folks.' 

The company also issued a statement following the hack. It said: 'Our Twitter account was hijacked overnight for about two hours during which a series of offensive tweets was posted to the account. 

'We apologize for the nature of the posts that were made during that time, and we are now conducting an investigation to try to determine what happened and who might have been involved.'
