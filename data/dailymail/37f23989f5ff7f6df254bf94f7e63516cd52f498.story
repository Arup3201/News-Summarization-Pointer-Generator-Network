Republican governor Tom Corbett has compared the marriage of same-sex couples to the marriage of a brother and sister.

The Pennsylvania governor this morning agreed his lawyers' comparison of the marriage of gay couples to the marriage of children in a recent court filing was 'inappropriate', before stunning the television anchor with a new analogy.Â 

'It was an inappropriate analogy, you know,' the first-term governor  said on WHP-TV in Harrisburg. 'I think a much better analogy would have been brother and sister, don't you?'

Controversial: Republican Governor Tom Corbett has compared the marriage of same-sex couples to the marriage of a brother and sister

Corbett is widely considered 'one of the country's most unpopular governors', with the latest polls showing only 20 per cent of voters feel his 
performance in office to date merits his re-election.

Nearly 70 
per cent believe that it is time for a change, according to the latest Franklin & Marshall College poll.

F&M poll director and political science professor G. Terry Madonna told PENN Live Corbett has 'serious re-election problems' for 2014, because his priorities are out of step with voters.

He
said Corbett's emphasis on privatizing the state's liquor stores in 
addition to cuts to education funding have made him deeply unpopular 
with his electorate.

Corbett, a lawyer, former federal prosecutor and state attorney general, has been married to Susan Manbeck Corbett since 1972.

They have two children: Tom Corbett, a project manaer for Electronic Arts in California, and Katherine Corbett Gibson, a former city prosecutor in Philadelphia.

Corbett Gibson has reportedly separated from her husband Gerold Gibson, a 17-year veteran narcotics officer accused of stealing money and clothing from targeted drug homes.

The couple has a son, Liam.

Corbett also said this morning that he does not think a pending legal challenge to Pennsylvania's ban on same-sex marriage belongs in federal court.

'The Supreme Court left it up to the states to determine under their laws as to what is and isn't a marriage,' Corbett said.

'The federal court shouldn't even be involved in this. But if they say they are, then they're going to make a determination whether the state has the right to determine that a marriage is only between a man and a woman and not between two individuals of the same sex.'

Messages left for a Corbett spokesman were not immediately returned.

State attorneys in August included a reference to children in a legal brief involving same-sex couples seeking marriage licenses.

In the court filing opposing allowing same-sex couples to intervene in the state's lawsuit to bar a suburban Philadelphia county from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, the lawyers made an analogy to a pair of 12-year-olds, saying if the children were issued a marriage license and tried to defend it in court, they wouldn't be taken seriously because the license was never valid.

Corbett later rejected that analogy, saying the case revolved around the question of whether a public official had 'the authority to disregard state law based on his own personal legal opinion about the constitutionality of a statute.'
