A former 1980s corporate raider who provided the inspiration for iconic ‘Wall Street’ movie character Gordon Gekko is being sued by his ex-wife over unpaid debts.

Asher Edelman, 73, owes $330,000 to his third-wife Regina Edelman according to Manhattan Supreme Court papers. 

The couple filed for divorce in New York in 2000 and Asher has since gone on to marry his fourth wife, Michelle.

She claims that he owes her $800,000 for breaking a contract with her related to a Family Court action in 2003, reports the New York Post.

Brazilian-born Regina, 75, claims he stopped making payments on the debt in June 2008. She is demanding the remainder of her money plus interest.

Edelman’s Wall Street career begin in the 1960s, By the 80s he was considered a pioneer of leveraged buyouts, acquiring companies largely through borrowed money – as well as an avid collector of art by the likes of Joan Miró, John Chamberlain and Jean-Michel Basquiat.

When Stanley Weiser, the screenwriter of Oliver Stone's ‘Wall Street,' saw Edelman's art-filled apartment in a magazine in the 1980s, he changed his script so that the Gekko collected art as well.

'The sophisticated part of Gekko, his 
home and the auctions and that veneer of culture - I modeled all that on
Edelman,' said Mr. Weiser.

Director Oliver Stone and actor Michael Douglas also shadowed Edelman at work when preparing for the film.

A year after Wall Street was released in 1987, Edelman had virtually retired from high finance and moved to Switzerland, where he presented the first major European retrospectives of artists including Roy Lichtenstein, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Robert Mapplethorpe.

He has since returned to New York City, where he runs his art financing firm and has fought several lawsuits. In 2010 he was sued for $3 million in missed loan payments and defaulted on a Manhattan townhouse lease.

Attorney for both parties declined to comment.
