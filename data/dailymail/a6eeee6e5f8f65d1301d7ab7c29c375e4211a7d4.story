Police in Waco, Texas, who set up an online sex sting were shocked when their Internet post advertising child sex got more than 180 responses in just 12 hours. 

The operation, which had detectives posing as minors online, resulted in the arrests of 20 people, age 19 to 63. 

They were busted after arranging what they believed would be meetings to have sex with children. When they arrived, however, they found cops and handcuffs.

'It's really just about every kind of weird sicko you can think of,' McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara told the San Antonio Express-News.

McNamara said his detectives were horrified by the massive response to an online posting they made that advertised a minor wanting to have sex with adults. 

Of the 180 responses that cops got in 12 hours, many followed through and exchanged messages with detectives 

According to the Waco Tribune, detectives were so busy responding to the messages that they continued the exchanges even during off hours when they were away from work. 

'The response was incredible; these creeps came out of the woodwork,' Sheriff McNamara told the Tribune. 

In the end, 20 people - 18 men and two women - from three counties agreed to meetings with the detectives posing as vulnerable children. 

The law: McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara branded the 20 suspects 'weird sickos' and said he was surprised how easy it was to snare so many of them

They set up meetings at public places across Waco - in the Walmart parking lot, at the popular local restaurant Taco Bueno, the mall, grocery stores, a public park and at McDonald's. 

'I think it’s extremely dangerous. These people are shopping in the same places we shop,' the sheriff said. 

All 20 of the people arrested are dangerous 'child predators,' he added. 

They are charged with felony online solicitation of minors. Authorities said they are trying to add more charges as well.
