Ukip today claimed it had failed to breakthrough in London despite its success in the rest of the country - because voters in the capital are more 'media savvy and educated' than elsewhere.

Nigel Farage's party picked up more than 100 seats from Labour, the Tories and the Lib Dems in council elections nationally and is expected to top the European vote on Sunday.

But Mr Farage's campaign flopped in the capital, where Labour picked up key swing councils from the Tories.

Ukip failed to do as well in London as it did in the rest of the country. The party blamed the capital's 'educated, cultured and young' for the snub

Labour leader Ed Miliband greeted supporters and councillors at Redbridge Town Hall in Ilford, north east London. The party's success in the capital helped stem the national tide to Ukip

Labour gained Hammersmith and Fulham, Croydon, Merton and Redbridge councils, while the Tories picked up Kingston upon Thames from the Lib Dems and held on to Wandsworth, Bexley and Richmond.

Ukip spokeswoman Suzanne Evans was asked to explain the party's poor performance in London. Speaking on Radio 4 Ms Evans admitted the party had difficulty appealing to the 'educated, cultured and young'.

She said: 'I think it's simple and I think most people understand. London is its own person, its own body, its own individual character.

'It's very different from the rest of the country. Look at the social demographic - you have the sort of metropolitan elite who cannot really understand the heartache and the pain people around the country are feeling.

'We haven't really got our message across in London.'

Boris Johnson, speaking during a campaign rally this week, was successful in heading off a Ukip surge - but saw Tory voters siphoned off by Labour

She said London had a more 'media savvy, well educated population'. She added: 'They are more likely to have read some of the negative press there has been about us. And I think they are more likely yo have believed it.

'People outside London have been far more cynical about the media campaign and the campaign the other parties have waged against us.'

Ed Miliband's close ally Sadiq Khan is being credited with masterminding Labour's successful campaign in London

The contrast between London and the rest of the UK is set to pile pressure on the party's election co-ordinator Douglas Alexander.

In London, Mr Miliband chose his close ally Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary, to take charge of campaigning up to 2016.

Mr Khan’s campaign focussed on bread and butter help for squeezed families, including higher pay, rent curbs, more housing and the cost of fares.

Labour looks set to come first in both the contest for London’s eight European Parliament seats and in London-wide borough elections.

Ukip is expecting to top the European elections when the results are announced on Sunday. It was polling 27 per cent as voters went to the polls - followed by Labour on 26 and the Conservatives on 22 with the Lib-Dems one point behind the Greens on nine.

But in London, Ukip was trailing a distant third on just 20 per cent - behind Labour on 27 per cent and the Conservatives 23.

In the London council contests, Labour was pollig 38 per cent, the Conservatives second on 33 and the Lib-Dems third on 13. Ukip was set to be backed by just 10 per cent of the public.
