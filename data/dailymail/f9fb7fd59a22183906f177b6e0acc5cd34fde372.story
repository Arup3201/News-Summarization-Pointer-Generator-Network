1. Winning performance

2. Player's performance per match

3. Appearances

4. Goals scored

5. Assists

6. Clean sheets

9. Cheikhou Kouyate, West Ham (PPI score: 30.2)

Kouyate netted his first Premier League goal against Arsenal on Sunday, but was not able to stop his side falling to a 2-1 defeat at Upton Park.

8. David Silva, Manchester City (PPI score: 30.6)

The diminutive Spain international scored his fourth Premier League goal in his last three games as Manchester City ended up throwing away a two-goal lead against Burnley.

5. Papiss Cisse, Newcastle (PPI score: 36.7)

Cisse also used the ball well for Newcastle, evidenced by his 93.8 per cent pass completion.
