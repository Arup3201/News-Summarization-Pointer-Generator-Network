Shoppers could be banned from buying hair bleach, nail varnish remover and drain cleaners under new anti-terrorism proposals.

The Home Office is examining ways to restrict the availability of chemicals which would-be terrorists could use to manufacture explosives.

Yesterday it published proposals to inhibit the sale of chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide, which is found in home hair dyeing kits, disinfectants and fish tank cleaner, and acetone, found in nail varnish remover and used to remove popular gel nail polish.

New anti-terrorism proposals would limit the sale of hydrogen peroxide, pictured, which can be used to make explosives

Under the new proposals, the public could be banned from buying them altogether, or would be required to obtain a licence before buying them.  Another suggestion is that purchasers would have to give their name and address to the retailers at the till.

The plans have been published as a part of a European Union drive to limit the availability of chemicals that can be used in terrorism.

Drawn up after a consultation, the Home Office proposal says: 'Further Government intervention is necessary to deter and detect terrorist acquisition of explosive precursors, and to comply with EU law.'

It aims not just to prevent terrorist attacks, but to alert authorities to anyone planning such attacks.

A list of chemicals whose sale would be restricted includes hydrogen peroxide, used in home bleach, fish tank cleaner, wound disinfectant, metal etching kits and swimming pool and hot tub cleaners, and nitromethane, used as fuel for model engines.

Potassium chlorate and sodium chlorate, used in weedkiller and home fireworks, are on the list, which also includes acetone, used in nail varnish remover, sulphuric acid, found in drain and swimming pool cleaner, and hexamine, found in camping fuel tablets.

The Home Office proposal says: 'In the UK and globally, explosives have been the terrorist’s weapon of choice for many years.

'Homemade explosives have been part of over 70% of UK homeland attacks since the late 1990s.  They are capable of causing mass harm and significant infrastructure damage.

'Some of the chemicals used to make the explosives used in the attacks also have legitimate uses in the home. It is important that we protect against their misuse, whilst still allowing legitimate use.'

Muslim extremists behind the 7/7 terror attacks on London in 2005 used bombs made with hydrogen peroxide from hair dye.  The attacks left 52 people dead and more than 700 injured.

These are among the chemicals whose sale might be restricted under new proposals from the Home Office, and their main uses:

Hydrogen peroxide: Fish tank cleaner, wound disinfectant, metal etching, cleaning and treatment, bleaching agent

Nitromethane: Model engine fuel

Nitric acid: Metal etching

Potassium chlorate: Pyrotechnics, herbicide

The proposed legislation would see restrictions on a raft of chemicals currently available on the open market

Potassium perchlorate: Pyrotechnics and rocket propellant

Sodium chlorate: Pyrotechnics, herbicide

Sodium perchlorate: Pyrotechnics, rocket propellant

Hexamine: Camping fuel tablets

Sulphuric acid: Swimming pool cleaner, drain cleaner

Acetone: Household solvent, nail varnish remover

Potassium nitrate: Food preservative, fertiliser

Sodium nitrate: Food preservative, fertiliser

Calcium nitrate: Fertiliser

Calcium ammonium nitrate: Fertiliser
