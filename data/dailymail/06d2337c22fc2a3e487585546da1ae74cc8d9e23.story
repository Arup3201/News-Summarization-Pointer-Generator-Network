The Sydney property market is about to get a hit of La Vida Loca as Ricky Martin's ex-rental property goes up for auction with hopes of fetching more than $11 million.

138 Hewlett Street in Bronte was rented by The Voice judge for three weeks in 2014 as a home for his twin sons, Matteo and Valentino.

'The Wave House', designed by renowned Australian architect Walter Barda, last sold in 2003 for $2.8 million, is built over several levels which all open to spectacular views of Sydney's iconic Bronte Beach.

138 Hewlett Street in Bronte is going under the hammer in March with an anticipated sale price of $11 million

The property reflects its million-dollar price tag, and comes complete with an in-built lap pool which runs from inside to outside, a private gym, and multiple terraces which flow onto the expansive living area.

The Hewlett Street mansion was built by the founder of private investment company Blackfish, Simon Harvey, who also purchased the adjoining rear property in 2007, reported Domain.

The property has floor-to-ceiling glass windows overlooking a private courtyard, a second outdoor pool, and open plan kitchen and living area.

The mansion is constructed from stained timber and stone, and is divided into two areas to accommodate family and visiting guests.

The bottom floor includes a 'lanai', a Hawaiian covered room, to allow visitors to have some space while staying in the house.

'The timber blinds can be pulled down if they choose to have a rest. But they can also use the space as a retreat during the day for reading,' architect Walter Barda told Stephen Crafti in his book Beach Houses Down Under.

Scheduled for auction in May, it is not yet known whether the property will be rented out again to A-listers such as Martin, or kept for private use.

Martin is set to call Sydney home for the duration of filming the fourth season of The Voice, along with co-judges Joel and Benji Madden, Delta Goodrem, and Jessie J.

Despite living in some of the world's most glamorous cities - Paris, New York, Buenos Aires - the 42-year-old has an affinity with Australia which he says reminds him of his native Puerto Rico.

'My kids were born on the road. We spend most of our time in New York. We are from Puerto Rico but (the boys) don't ask when are we going back to New York...they just want to go back to Australia,' he told the Sunday Telegraph.

The Livin' La Vida Loca singer said his worldly five-year-olds have even adapted to the Aussie lingo and beach culture.

'They have the Aussie slang down but the thing is when I come here, I live at the beach and I feel like I have the same life we have back home. Those walks on the beach, those sunsets, the bike rides. I'm an islander and I don't want to change that.'

Martin rented another eastern suburbs home in Bondi Beach in 2013 when he lived in Sydney with his then-partner and the father of his twins, Carlos Gonsalez Abella.

The Puerto-Rican rented the property from business magnate James Packer, who moved back into the house following his split from Erica Packer.

The 42-year-old may now need to look for a new pad to rent when he arrives back in Sydney in April for his One World Tour.

The Hewlett Street property, which delivers panoramic ocean views from its cliff-top sandstone ramparts, is hoped to fetch upwards of $11 million, which would be a record for the area.

Test cricketer Shane Watson and his wife Lee sold their Hewlett Street property for $9 million in October 2014, breaking price records and setting a new standard, reported Domain.

The property was 449 square metres, half the size of the 908 square metres 138 Hewlett Street offers prospective buyers.
