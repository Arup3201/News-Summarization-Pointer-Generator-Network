A small Canada town has a very interesting rite of spring: every year thousands of male garter snakes emerge from their dens and pile onto the females in writhing 'mating balls' dozens of snakes strong.

The red-sided garter snakes of Manitoba winter together in mass pits where their incredible numbers make the sites the largest gatherings of snakes on the planet.

When things warm up and the snakes get moving, the first thing on their minds is to mate--and they do that en masse as well in a incredible, if stomach turning, display.

Creepy! The red-sided garter snakes of Manitoba winter together in dens that can have over 10,000 individuals

Frenzied: Each year the smaller males emerge first from their dens when warmth finally comes to the Canadian plains. They wait eagerly outside the dens by the thousands for the females to come out of their hibernation

The best place to spot these mating balls is in the Narcisse Snake Dens of Manitoba, Canada, where the CBC took this stunning footage of the event.

Each year, the smaller males emerge first from their caves when warmth finally comes to the Canada plains.

They wait by the thousands outside the dens until slowly and just by ones and twos, the significantly larger females emerge.

No time to lose: Once the females slowly start to emerge, the males pounce

Clamoring males pursue a female by the dozens

Scent of a woman: The females eventually shake the males by rolling until they fall off, but the males still try to pursue her as her sex pheromones drive them mad

Dozens of males twist and turn around each female's body in a frenzied attempt to mate.

The mating balls are a tightly wound group of males with one female at the center.

When she decides she's had enough, the female detaches from the males in a sort crocodilian death roll.

A single red-sided garter snake den, and the ensuing sexual display, can contain up to 10,000 snakes and carpet the ground completely in slithering, shiny black scales.

Where the action is: The Narcisse Sname Dens in Manitoba are one of the best places to spot the creepy crawly rite of spring each year

The red-sided garter snake only lives 
in dens of 1,000s in Canada, where the cold-blooded creatures require 
the warmth of the group in order to survive the winter.

Anyone with a desire to see the snake dens may do so when the weather warms up in Narcisse, Manitoba, Canada.

The Narcisse Snake Dens are home to tens of thousands of red-sided garters and each spring the sexual displays are hard to miss.

In addition to seeing them emerge from their dens, visitors may also watch the snakes' annual return.

In
 the fall, as they sense the temperature dropping, the snakes regroup in
 the warm dens in a display a lot like the spring emergence, but in 
reverse.
