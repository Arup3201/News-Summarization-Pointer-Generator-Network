A Bank of America worker whose right hand, arm and leg were disabled in a car accident is suing the bank after they allegedly fired him for his typing and walking too slowly.

Daniel Hermann, 38, was left without the full use of his right limbs after he was severely injured in the crash in 1992, but the bank said accommodating him 'wouldn't be fair to people with two hands'.

Hermann, from Irwin, Pennsylvania, claims he was fired on September 20, 2010 for being a couple of minutes late from his lunch break as it took him longer to walk from the lunch room due to his limp.

In a lawsuit, he also said the bank repeatedly ignored his pleas for breaks and equipment to accommodate his disabilities and told him they didn't follow rules set out in the Disabilities Act.

'We've filed this lawsuit because Bank 
of America's conduct was unacceptable and the company should be held 
accountable when its supervisors and managers violate the law,' his attorney, Emily Town, told ABC News.

Hermann had worked in the customer service department for Merill Lynch, helping mortgagors behind on their payments,  for three years before it was acquired by the Bank of America in January 2010.

Prior to the acquisition, he had 'thrived' in the work place as Merill Lynch accommodated his disabilities, including allowing him to take break between calls to type up notes with his left hand, and providing him with a left-handed keyboard, the lawsuit says.

These conditions allowed Hermann, who had a total of 13 years in the banking industry, to regularly earn a monthly bonus if he spoke to five mortgagors every hour.

But when his job was transferred to Bank of America's customer service department, the support vanished, the lawsuit claims.

The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disability, which is defined as 'a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity'.

The protective law is flexible but it can only be strengthened, not weakened, in the future.

In terms of employment, it prohibits an employer discriminating against a qualified worker with a disability.

It covers job application procedures, promotions, advancement and training. It also demands that reasonable accommodations are made for disabled employees with physical or mental limitations.

As well as the workplace, the law extends to public transport, accommodation, public facilities and communications for people who are blind or deaf.

Supervisors said he was not allowed to take time between calls to enter information into his system, meaning he could only take three or four calls an hour - and miss out on his bonuses.

He claims he repeatedly brought up his issues with supervisors, asking if he could work in a different department with less typing or to alter his performance criteria - but he was refused.

He told his supervisor about the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which prohibits employers 
from discriminating against qualified individuals with disabilities and to help accommodate them.

But one supervisor responded: 'Bank of America is not going to do anything 
for you,' and 'Bank of America doesn't have ADA rules,' according to the lawsuit.

Another added that accommodating him 'wouldn't be fair to people with two hands'.

Hermann said he complained about the comments on an employee hotline.

In January 2010, he started to receive warnings that he was returning late from lunch break, but he countered that his limp meant it took him longer to get to and from the dining room.

There was one canteen nearby but, if it was fully occupied, he sometimes had to go to one on a different floor, and he could often not get back in time, he said.

He eventually received six warnings for being merely seconds or
minutes late from his lunch break and was eventually fired, the lawsuit claims, ABC reported.

Hermann filed a charge of 
discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on March
18, 2011 and is suing them for back pay, front pay and compensatory and punitive damages.

Town, his attorney, called Hermann a 'hard worker who needed very minor accommodations for his obvious disabilities'.

Shirley Norton, a spokeswoman for the bank, said the company could not comment until it has reviewed the suit.

'But I can tell you that Bank of America is committed to providing programs and accommodations to support the needs of employees with disabilities,' she told ABC.
