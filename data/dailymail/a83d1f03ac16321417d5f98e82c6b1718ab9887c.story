The Chelsea squad was given rapturous reception as they were unveiled before the Real Sociedad friendly, with returning club legend Didier Drogba back on the Stamford Bridge pitch.

Each player was introduced individually to the crowd including Drogba, despite the Ivorian striker being injured and unavailable for the clash with the La Liga club.

Drogba, who re-signed for the Blues on a free from Galatasaray this summer, was joined on the pitch alongside Chelsea’s summer signings Cesc Fabregas, Diego Costa and Filipe Luis who all made their Stamford Bridge debuts.
