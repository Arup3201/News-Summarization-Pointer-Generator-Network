President Obama urged a crowd of black American males on Sunday to stop blaming discrimination for personal failures and to strive to be better fathers and husbands

In a rare and personal commencement address at the historically black, all-male Morehouse College, Obama pointed out that 'too many young men in our community continue to make bad choices.'

'Growing up, I made a few myself,' he said. 'And I have to confess, sometimes I wrote off my own failings as just another example of the world trying to keep a black man down. But one of the things you've learned over the last four years is that there's no longer any room for excuses.'

President Obama urges Morehouse College grads to take responsibility for their communities

President Barack Obama told graduates to use the opportunities they have been given to help others less fortunate than themselves

With growing competition for jobs and
 the globalization of the work force, Obama said, 'nobody is going to 
give you anything you haven't earned.'

'Nobody cares how tough your upbringing was. 
Nobody cares if you suffered some discrimination,' he added.

The president also spoke about the importance of family and what it was like growing up with an absent father. He challenged graduates to 'transform the way we think about manhood.'

'My whole life, I’ve tried to be for Michelle and my girls what my 
father wasn’t for my mother and me,' he said. 'I want to break that 
cycle - where a father’s not at home, where a father’s not helping to 
raise that son and daughter. I want to be a better father, a better 
husband, a better man.'

Obama's father, Barack Hussein Obama Sr., was a Kenyan governmental economist who divorced the younger Obama's mother within three years of marrying her. They met at the University of Hawaii and married in 1961, the year President Obama was born. By 1964, the elder Obama had returned to his native Kenya.

Obama said he was lucky to have his mother and grandparents, who raised him, and said that under different circumstances, he could have ended up in prison or 
unemployed.

'I might have been in prison. I might 
have been unemployed. I might not
 have been able to support a family — and that motivates me,' he said.

While he urged graduates to not use race as an 
excuse for their failures, he acknowledged that the 'bitter legacy' of discrimination still
 exists in America.

'At some point in life as an African American you have to work twice as hard as anyone else if you want to get by,' he said.

He said: 'It is not just the African-American community that needs you. The country needs you. The world needs you.

'See,
 as Morehouse Men, many of you know what it’s like to be an outsider; to
 be marginalized; to feel the sting of discrimination.

'That’s
 an experience that so many other Americans share. Hispanic Americans 
know that feeling when someone asks where they come from or tells them 
to go back.

'Gay and lesbian Americans feel it 
when a stranger passes judgment on their parenting skills or the love 
they share. Muslim Americans feel it when they’re stared at with 
suspicion because of their faith.

'Any woman who knows the injustice of earning less pay for doing the same work – she sure feels it.'

The president paid homage to Morehouse alum Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who attended Morehouse, saying he 'helped to forge the intellect, the discipline, the compassion, the soul force that would transform America.'

During the address, the president rallied against the racism of the 1940s and 50s and the Jim Crow laws.

He told the graduates that despite the obstacles, people like Dr King were able to learn how to be 'unafraid'.

He said: 'For
 black men in the forties and fifties, the threat of violence, the 
constant humiliations, large and small, the gnawing doubts born of a Jim
 Crow culture that told you every day you were somehow inferior, the 
temptation to shrink from the world, to accept your place, to avoid 
risks, to be afraid, was necessarily strong. 

'And yet, 
here, under the tutelage of men like Dr. Mays, young Martin learned to 
be unafraid.  He, in turn, taught others to be unafraid.' 

President Obama was speaking at the ceremony yesterday where he was given an honorary doctorate of laws degree.
