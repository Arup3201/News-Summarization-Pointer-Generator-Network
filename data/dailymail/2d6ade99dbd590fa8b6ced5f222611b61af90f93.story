A secret underground emergency Cold War bunker sold at auction today for £140,000, nearly three times the asking price.

The bunker, which was constructed in Coswarth in Cornwall at the height of the Cold War, was built so experts at the then South West Water Authority would be able to maintain water and sewerage operations during a nuclear emergency.

The 3,000 square foot bunker, built in 1978 to house 17 people - seven in the operations room, six in the communications room and three in the control room, had a guide price of £50,000.

Discrete: The rooms themselves are all deep underground, with the only hint of life below the surface being a small brick entrance building

The bunker's features include several blast-proof doors, an air lock, a decontamination room, a dining room, a recreation room and two dormitories.

underground, with the only hint of life below the surface being a small 
brick entrance building.

Brian Blake, South West Water's asset performance manager, worked for the Authority at the time and can recall visiting the bunker as it was being prepared for potential habitation.

'I remember that the Government said we had to provide an underground control centre in case of emergency which was bomb and nuclear proof,' he said.

'It wasn't fully kitted out as there was no furniture in there, but if something had happened you could have lived in there for weeks.'

Chris Shapland, the Authority's 
property manager, added: 'We regularly auction redundant assets to 
reduce our costs and keep customers' bills as low as possible, but this 
is the first time we've offered a genuine piece of Cold War history.'

'Novelty
 sites with small areas of surplus land always attract strong interest 
as people are able to invest relatively modest sums for their 'little 
bit of England',' he added.

Mr
 Shapland said several of the Authority's former storage reservoirs and 
pumping stations have already been converted by their new owners into 
unusual homes.

The new owner of this bunker has chosen to remain anonymous.

The bunker and adjacent land eventually sold for £140,000, nearly three times the asking price

The purchase may come in handy for the 
owner as tensions between the West and Russia reach their most extreme 
point since the cold war, with Putin expelled from of the G8 today.

Earlier, Western leaders from the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan met in The Hague as the G7 for the first time since Russian was brought into the group in 1998.

David Cameron has also announced that the June G8 meeting scheduled to take place in Sochi, the Black Sea town where the Winter Olympics was held, will not take place.

America and the EU have been tightening the diplomatic noose around Russia since it occupied and then annexed the Ukranian province of Crimea following a revolution in the country.

Asset freezes and visa bans have already been issued against a handful of Russian officials blamed for instigating the crisis, and leaders have warned of further economic sanctions and political isolation should Russian aggression continue.

It has been reported by American observers today that Russia has 30,000 troops poised on Ukraine's eastern border, raising fears of further land-grabs in the mostly Russian-speaking east of the country.
