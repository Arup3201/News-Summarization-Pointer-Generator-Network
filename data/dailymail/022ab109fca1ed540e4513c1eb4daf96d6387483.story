Tari Turpin, 34, allegedly shot himself in the leg after shooting two women aboard a PATH Train

An ex-con opened fire on a train in New Jersey and wounded two passengers - and then himself - after becoming enraged when a stranger objected to him falling asleep on her shoulder, police said today.

Tari Turpin, 34, pulled out a 9mm Glock semi-automatic pistol and started shooting aboard a PATH Train in Jersey City, New Jersey, on Sunday morning.Â 

He shot one woman in the ankle and hit another in the hand. Then, he accidentally shot himself in the leg, according to reports. None of the injuries were life-threatening.

Turpin was riding the train with his girlfriend and their two children at the time, WABC-TV reports.

The TV station spoke to Diamond Drummer, who said Turpin was falling sleep on her on her ride home from New York City about 5.10am.

When she asked the man not to lean on her, he became furious and pulled out his pistol and racked the slide, Ms Drummer said.

Her brother, who was riding in the train car with her, intervened and convinced Turpin to put the gun away.

The shooting happened aboard a PATH Train in Jersey City, New Jersey, about 5.10am on Sunday. It restricted service on the New Jersey-to-Manhattan trains for several hours

Ms Drummer said she then remarked, 'Who pulls out a gun for something like this?'

That's when Turpin started firing, Ms Drummer told WABC.

He fired several shots, striking Ms Drummer in the ankle. He hit another passenger, Aubree Marshall, in the hand.

The gunfire ended when Turpin wounded himself in the leg.

All three were taken to the Jersey City Medical Center for treatment.

The shooting happened aboard a PATH Train while other passengers were in the car

PATH train service between Journal Square in Jersey City and Hoboken, New Jersey, was suspended in both directions for three hours.

Turpin, of East Orange, New Jersey, was hit with a litany of charges: Two counts of aggravated assault, unlawful possession of a weapon, possession of a weapon for unlawful purpose, making terrorist threats, risking widespread injury or damage, possession of hollow point bullets, being a convict in possession of a weapon and resisting arrest.
