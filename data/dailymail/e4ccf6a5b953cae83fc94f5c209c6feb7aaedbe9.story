German Bundesliga side Schalke have always managed to maintain their strong connection to the local mining industry and have brought that theme into their stadium this season.

Nicknamed the ‘Miners’, Schalke have redesigned the Veltins-Arena tunnel, that the players and staff use to get from the dressing rooms to the pitch, to replicate a coal mine.

It’s thought the idea behind the renovation is to unsettle opponents with the dimly lit enclosure but also to remind the players of the club’s local working-class roots.

Schalke finished third last season in the Bundesliga and started their campaign with a 2-1 loss away at Hannover.

However the first opponents to enter the newly designed tunnel were reigning champions Bayern Munich as Schalke managed to hold Pep Guardiola's side to a 1-1 draw on Saturday.

The Miners have also been drawn in the Champions League group stages alongside Chelsea, Sporting Lisbon and Celtic’s qualifying conquerors, Maribor.
