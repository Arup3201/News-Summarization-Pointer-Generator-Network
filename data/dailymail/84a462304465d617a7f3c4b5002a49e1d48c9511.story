Argentina striker Gonzalo Higuain refused to be drawn on reports linking him with a move to Barcelona until after the World Cup.

The Napoli forward only moved to Italy from Real Madrid last summer but scoring 17 goals during his debut season in Serie A has attracted admiring glances from Europe's elite clubs.

The 26-year-old claims to have had no offers about a potential return to Spain, despite previously insisting that he was 'flattered' by supposed interest from Barcelona.

Higuain, who almost completed a move to Arsenal last season before signing for Napoli for a club record £34.5million, still has four years remaining on his contract.

'I know nothing about Barcelona and I feel good at Napoli. But now, I want to think only about the World Cup.'

'I have nothing to say because there has been nothing,' he said.

Higuain’s father, and agent, added: 'Gonzalo feels good at Napoli and he won’t change club. I have nothing to deny because there has been nothing concrete.'

Argentina face Switzerland in the round of 16 at the World Cup on July 1.
