Six men accused of raping a 39-year-old tourist and beating her husband with sticks during a cycling holiday in India have appeared in court.

The suspects, who police say are local farmers, were arrested yesterday and have been charged with gang rape.

The attack comes just three months after the gang rape and fatal beating of a student in Delhi that sparked protests across India.

Campaigners said women in the country are becoming more vulnerable as 'the men have gone totally berserk.'

Police said all six suspects are aged between 20 and 25 and belong to a local tribe.

They have been remanded in custody and are due back in court tomorrow.

The Swiss couple told police that the woman was raped by seven or eight men, but that it was dark and they could not be
 sure of the exact number.

They said the man was beaten and tied to a tree while his wife was sexually assaulted.

It is the latest in a string of violent sex attacks in India that has shocked the subcontinent.

One 23-year-old was raped and tortured 
in December, and a 29-year-old who was grabbed from a bus in and gang 
raped in Amritsar by six men in January.

Campaigners are concerned at the 
growing vulnerability of women in India despite assurances from the 
Government that they will tackle abuse.

Ranjana Kumari of the Centre for Social 
Research think tank said 127 cases of rape have been registered in Delhi since the fatal assault on the student.

She told The Telegraph: 'It is absolutely shocking and speaks volumes on how Indian society is 
treating women.

'The men have gone totally berserk. We're feeling 
frustrated and in despair. What must we do to change their mentality?'

The attack on the Swiss couple has 
also highlighted concerns about the rise in attacks on foreign women and
 those out with husbands or male friends.

The husband and wife had set up camp at a village near Datia town, in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, when up to eight men burst into their tent. 

The
 pack of men pounced on the couple, beating them with wooden sticks 
before overpowering the man and gang-raping his wife, the husband 
claimed.

Police said the gang then stole the pair's belongings and fled, Independent Online reported.

D.K.
 Arya, deputy inspector general of police said the gang took a laptop, 
10,000 rupees (£120) and a mobile phone, CNN reported.

The Swiss woman was taken to hospital, where medical examinations proved she had been raped, The News Tribe reported.

In a shocking turn of events the woman was paraded through a staring 
crowd as photographers jostled to take her pictures, mere hours after 
she had been attacked.

Cloaked with a towel to cover her face and head, two female police officers gripped the victim's arms as she was taken to hospital for a medical examination.

Her picture was taken as she was pulled through the swarm of people.

Swiss Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Tilman Renz described the case as 'deeply disturbing' and said Swiss 
diplomats were assisting the couple.

The
 diplomats called on Indian authorities 'to do everything to quickly 
find the perpetrators so that they can be held accountable,' Renz said 
in a statement.

One woman is raped every 20 minutes in India, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.

But police estimate only four out of 10 rapes are reported, largely due
 to victims' fear of being shamed by their families and communities.

Last 
month, the Swiss government issued a travel notice for India that 
included a warning about 'increasing numbers of rapes and other sexual 
offenses' in the South Asian nation.

The violent attack comes mere months after a horrifying attack on a young woman in the Indian capital.

India has seen a wave of violent sex attacks that have swept the subcontinent

Five
 men and a juvenile are awaiting trial for the sickening gang rape and 
attack the 23-year-old trainee physiotherapist in Delhi in December last
 year.

The assault triggered nationwide protests and an intense debate about rampant crime against women in India.

One of the accused is dead after he was found hanging in his cell.

Police allege the six attacked the woman and her male companion on the bus as the couple returned home after watching Life Of Pi on December 16.

The woman was repeatedly raped and tortured with a metal bar.

The couple were also severely beaten before being thrown onto a road.

The woman died of internal injuries in a Singapore hospital two weeks later.

In January a woman was travelling to her in-laws' home in Punjab when she was allegedly snatched and driven to a district bordering Amritsar, the Sikh holy city.

Five men joined the driver and conductor, who had taken her by motorbike to an unknown address, and took turns to rape the 29-year-old.

They dumped her near her in-laws' village the next morning where she told relatives of her ordeal, police said.

Six men were arrested and a seventh was on the run from police, officers said.

A 14-year-old schoolgirl was put on life support in hospital after being brutally gang-raped in rural India in late January.

Police had failed to make any arrests since the horrific attack in the Jalandhar district of Punjab ten days after the attack.

An Indian boy has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a security guard who allegedly told the child off for trying to rape an 11-year-old girl.

The boy, who has not been named, was arrested in Kalyan, in the outskirts of Mumbai, on suspicion of murder and molestation.

The child is accused of dragging a girl who lives near him onto the terrace of his home and trying to rape her, reported NDTV.

However, she managed to raise the alarm and escape.

Security guard Haji Abdul Jabbar Shaikh then publically warned the boy at a community meeting but he was attacked by six people on Friday as he was walking home.

Shahenaj Shaikh, the victim's mother, told NDTV: 'He protects everybody.

'He has done something good. He looked out for the girl, took care of her respect and became a martyr.'

She said her son was so badly beaten he could not stand or speak and local media said four of his fingers were chopped off during the attack.

As well as the child, police have arrested another man who is accused of murder.
