Oral Bryan, 44, has been sentenced to life in prison for killing his former partner with a hockey stick

A father-of-five who used a hockey stick to bludgeon his former girlfriend to death in front of their children has been sentenced to life in prison.

Oral Bryan, 44, hit Nicola McKenzie, the mother of their two children, over the head with the stick 'like an axe' during a furious row.

Miss McKenzie, 37, suffered horrific brain injuries and never regained consciousness, dying two days later in hospital. 

The row erupted in Moss Side, Manchester, on September 17 last year when Miss McKenzie spotted a car belonging to Bryan's new partner outside his home. 

She confronted the woman, who called Bryan, and he returned to intervene. 

As the two women squared up to one another, Bryan got a hockey stick from his house and cracked it over Miss McKenzie's head as she shouted: 'These are your kids, go on, show them what you're like.'  

The fatal blow, witnessed by the couple's two children, daughter Teja, 12, and son Amahri, eight, as well as Bryan's three other children, shattered Miss McKenzie's skull and left her lying unconscious in the street. 

As she lay dying with blood pouring from the head wound, Bryan picked up Miss McKenzie to check for signs of life before casually dumping her back down on the pavement and running off. 

Miss McKenzie - described as a devoted mother-of-two by her family - was taken to the intensive care unit at Hope Hospital in Salford with massive skull trauma and brain injuries but she  died two days later.

Bryan initially fled the scene, but contacted police a short time later and was arrested. 

He claimed Miss McKenzie had attacked him with a knife and he struck the fatal blow accidentally in self-defence, but no knife was recovered at the scene.  

He was found guilty of murder at an earlier hearing.

Diana Ellis, QC, defending, said her client was 'fully aware' of the impact of his actions, adding: 'No one wishes more that the clock could turned back.'

Sentencing Bryan to a minimum of 20 years at Manchester Crown Court today, Judge Michael Henshall said: 'Nicola McKenzie was a young woman in the prime of her life and the mother of two children of who you are the father.

'The effects of the events on that day in front of those children is almost uncountable.'

After the case, senior investigating officer Duncan Thorpe of Greater Manchester Police said: 'This was a tragic incident where the life of a woman was sadly cut short in brutal fashion by a man she was once close to.

'Oral David Bryan showed absolutely no concern about his victim and the only intention in his mind when he retrieved the hockey stick from his house was to cause serious harm.

'His lack of concern was further exemplified when he fled the scene to try and save himself rather than get medical attention for Nicola.

'I know the sentence passed here today won't bring her back or even begin to make up for their loss but I hope it will offer Nicola's family some closure and my thoughts are with them.'

Miss McKenzie's mother Veronica Fiddler, 62, a care worker said: 'Nicola was quiet and lovely and kind. She was completely dedicated to her children. She hardly ever went out without them, they were her life. She was a very, very good mother and that is how everybody knew her. The children are going to miss her very greatly.

'Myself and her father were there by her bedside when they turned off the life support machine. The whole community is in shock, she was very well-known.'
