It's the apartment no one knew about, and the one that millions of Harry Potter fans around the world would love to see.

Renowned actor Daniel Radcliffe has put his exclusive Melbourne apartment on the market after using the property as a home base in Australia for almost ten years.

98B St Georges Road in Toorak was purchased for $1.8 million by Radcliffe's parents Alan Radcliffe, a casting agent, and BBC casting director Marcia Gresham, and is expected to fetch around $2.4 million.

Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe has put his penthouse apartment in Toorak, Melbourne on the market

The three-bedroom apartment on Georges Street was bought for %1.8 million

The 25-year-old Englishman had the property bought for him by his parents in 2006 for the filming of Rod Harvy's December Boys, in which the then-16-year-old actor played an Australian orphan.

Radcliffe shot to fame at 11 years old when he was cast as the eponymous Harry Potter in the Warner Brothers film franchise, and is reported to have property in New York and London, as well as Melbourne.

The three-bedroom property was transferred to the Kill Your Darlings actor in 2007 when he turned 18, and was made use of by family and friends when Radcliffe was occupied with projects overseas, reported Domain. 

Marshall White's Marcus Chiminello told Daily Mail Australia that despite loving the privacy the apartment offered, Radcliffe has found himself visiting Australia less frequently than in previous years and had decided to put the much-loved apartment up for sale.

'He's based himself full-time in New York and has sadly decided to move on,' said Mr Chiminello,

The estate agent said that Radcliffe was a big fan of the large living area, which entailed almost half of the apartment, which made the residence an ideal place for entertaining friends and family.

Mr Chiminello said that the real estate agency had already had significant interest from Harry Potter enthusiasts, and said that he was intrigued to see whether that would play a role in the sale.

'I'm interested to see how many people come to the open house inspection dressed as Harry Potter,' Mr Chiminello said.

'Some people have said that they want to come down purely for the Harry factor, and I'd be intrigued to see if someone buys it purely for that reason.' 

The north facing St Georges Road apartment is spectacular in it's own right, winning the Victorian Apartment Project of the Year and nestled on one of Toorak's most exclusive streets.

The suburb has the highest average property values in Melbourne, and is home to other well-known Australians including media personality Eddie McGuire, former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, and and footballer Nathan Buckley.

The Toorak residence is one of only two penthouse-style apartments in the development, and is elevated to provide exposure to sunlight and offer privacy.

The apartment occupies the entire top level, and overlooks Melbourne's CBD and the Yarra River, located just five kilometres away in Melbourne's most expensive suburb.

Developed by prestige builder Stonehenge, the residence is accessed by a private lift, and features timber floors, floor-to-ceiling windows, and opens onto a rooftop terrace.

The kitchen is fully equipped with Miele appliances and also boasts a butler's pantry and laundry, and a walk-in pantry to aid entertaining.

The apartment houses three bedrooms, and the main features a built-in wardrobe, a walk-in wardrobe, and a grand ensuite.

Radcliffe's parents reportedly bought the apartment after seeing photographs of it online, out of a love for Australia.

'Someone my dad went to drama school with lives here [Melbourne]. We just got on with the place really, really well and so we just love it here,' Radcliffe told The Herald Sun in 2007.
