After 15 fruitless years of trying for a baby, Claire Sanderson had all but given up on her dream of becoming a mother.

Doctors had diagnosed her with unexplained infertility, and when her periods stopped altogether she and husband Dean thought it was 'the end of the road'.

So Claire, 33, was stunned two years later to learn that she was pregnant at last - and that her much longed-for baby was due in a matter of weeks.

'Unbelievable news': Claire Sanderson, who was diagnosed with unexplained infertility after 15 years of trying for a baby, is now a mother to Summer

Claire decided to take a pregnancy test after feeling an unexplained movement in her stomach last April. To the couple's joy, it was positive, and they were dumbfounded when doctors told them Claire was already seven months along.

Their 'little miracle' Summer arrived just eight weeks later.

‘We are still in shock about it,' said Claire.

We had been trying for a baby for 15 years, and then suddenly a baby comes along in eight weeks.

‘I had never imagined I could be pregnant, but when I felt unwell for a number of weeks, I did a pregnancy test just to make sure.

‘When I looked at the positive test stick in my hand I just burst into tears. When the doctor said I would be due in a matter of weeks, it just seemed the most unbelievable news.’

Shock: Claire was stunned to learn she was seven months pregnant with baby Summer after all but giving up hope of becoming a mother

The couple started trying for a family just after they met in September 1997. After five years nothing had happened, so Mrs Sanderson went to see her GP.

Mrs Sanderson said: ‘Dean underwent tests and he was fine, so we knew that it must be something that was wrong with me.

‘But I had a series of tests too, and although the doctors said that I had slightly polycystic ovaries, they said it was unexplained infertility. They said there was no reason why I shouldn’t fall pregnant and we should keep trying.

‘Dean was reassuring me that it would be alright and we would be parents soon. We never gave up hope.’

But as the years passed, Mrs Sanderson still hadn’t fallen pregnant. And two years ago - thirteen years after they started trying - her periods stopped altogether.

She said: ‘It was devastating not to be able to fall pregnant. Everywhere I looked, I saw mothers and babies, and it was heartbreaking.

‘I so desperately wanted to be a mum. I would try and be happy for friends and family when they fell pregnant, but I was devastated inside.

‘When my periods finally stopped, I thought that was it. We’d already been trying for 13 years with no success, I thought that was definitely the end of the road for us. We never gave up hope totally, we were always hoping for a miracle, but realistically we thought our chances were probably over.’

At the beginning of last April, Mrs Sanderson was lying in the bath when she felt a sudden fluttering movement in her stomach.

She said: ‘I’d never felt anything like it in my life. I could feel this movement. I shouted to Dean. He wanted me to do a pregnancy test but I didn’t want to, as I thought it would make me upset when it came out negative.

‘But Dean insisted, so we did a test and it was positive. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. After all these years I was finally looking at a positive pregnancy test.’

Claire went for a scan at Hull Royal Infirmary and doctors delivered the most surprising news. She was 31 weeks pregnant.

She added: ‘It was such a shock when the doctors told me I was so far pregnant. I’d had no idea.

‘We only had a few weeks to be prepared. We’d been waiting for 15 years for this moment.  And it was nearly here. All our family rallied around and helped us get everything ready for the baby’s arrival.

Claire gave birth to her daughter Summer just eight weeks later - a week early  - at Hull Royal Infirmary, weighing a healthy 6Ib 8oz.

She said: ‘I was only in labour for five hours. It seemed like after waiting for so long, Summer was in such a hurry to get here.

‘When I’d given birth to her I was still in shock about even being pregnant. It was a wonderful feeling to have our daughter, but it felt like she wasn’t ours.

‘Dean even jokes that it is as though we are babysitting her and soon we will have to give her back. After waiting so long, everything happened so quickly and it still hasn’t sunk in that we are parents at last.

‘Our little miracle took 15 years - and then took just eight weeks and five hours to arrive.’
