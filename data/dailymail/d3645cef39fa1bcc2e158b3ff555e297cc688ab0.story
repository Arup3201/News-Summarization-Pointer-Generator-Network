Dani Alves will be offered a new contract by Barcelona.

The Brazilian, 31, is out of contract next summer and has suggested he was ready to move. Alves said: ‘This will be my last season at Barcelona. Next year I will move to England.’

Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United and City are all interested but talks over a new deal have begun.

Alves didn't have his best night against PSG on Tuesday but he has played a part in Barcelona going five games without conceding in the league and he was at his assist-giving best in the weekend thrashing of Granada crossing for Leo Messi to score.

The two have combined brilliantly throughout the last seven years and the Argentine will miss him. What remains to be seen is which Premier League coach is prepared to take a gamble on the world's most attacking full-back.
