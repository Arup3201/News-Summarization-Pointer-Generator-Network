Taxpayers spent a staggering $172million in six years on penis pumps valued at twice the price they would have cost in a store.

The U.S. government's Medicare program blew the cash between 2006 and 2011, according to a government watchdog's report released yesterday.

The inspector general for the Department 
of Health and Human Services said the health 
insurance system for seniors paid for nearly 474,000 claims for vacuum 
erection systems, or VES, totaling about $172.4 million from 2006 to 
2011.

A staggering $172million was spent on penis pumps between 2006 and 2011, a report has revealed

Yearly claims for the devices nearly doubled from $20.6 million in 2006 to $38.6 million in 2011.

According to the Mayo Clinic, penis pumps are one of a few treatment options for erectile dysfunction.

Government waste is a major issue in budget talks in the U.S. capital as lawmakers try to reach agreement on a $1 trillion spending bill.

'Medicare payment amounts for VES remain grossly excessive compared with the amounts that non-Medicare payers pay,' said the report, dated December 2013.

'Medicare currently pays suppliers more than twice as much for VES as the Department of Veterans Affairs and consumers over the Internet pay for these types of devices.'

If Medicare had adjusted its payments to approximately the price non-Medicare payers pay, the U.S. government would have saved an average of about $14.4 million for each of the six years, the report said.

'Considering the strain retiring baby boomers will soon be placing on Medicare's budget, shouldn't we be focusing this entitlement program on real, life-saving treatment and equipment to serve the health needs of seniors - instead of subsidizing penis pump purchases?' Ben Domenech of the Heartland Institute think tank said in an email statement.

'And to those seniors who really do want one,' added Domenech, 'just buy it yourself - you don't need to send the bill to your fellow Americans.'
