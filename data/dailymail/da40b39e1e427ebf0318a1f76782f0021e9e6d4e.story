Bayern Munich put smiles on the faces of schoolchildren and the local community in Macedonia when they donated seats from their stadium in order for a new ground to be built at the Nuri Mazari school.

The German champions were approached by the school about the possibility of donating 100 seats from the renovated South Stand of the Allianz Arena earlier this summer.

And with Bayern having part of the stadium knocked down for a standing-only vicinity in the close season, this left hundreds of seats up for grabs.

And Bayern were more than happy to help offering an additional 155 seats to the original quota, bringing the total up to 255.

The small town of Dollogozhda couldn't have imagined beyond their wildest dreams that such a gesture would be made by one of the world's biggest clubs, with the new stadium now a prized location for the community to interact together.

At the grand opening a tournament was hosted with a huge number of the school children celebrating the unveiling fittingly with a game of football.
