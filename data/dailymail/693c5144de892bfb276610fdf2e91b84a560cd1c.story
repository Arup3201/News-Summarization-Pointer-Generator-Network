The family of an elderly woman who died in agony after developing a horrific bedsore which left her spine exposed, have received a £20,000 pay out.

The NHS Litigation Authority reached an out of court settlement with the family of Molly Etty, 84, who died of a blood infection after developing a sore the size of a fist.

Miss Etty was admitted to Southend University Hospital, on July 8, 2011, after she fell at her home and needed a hip replacement.

Molly Etty, 84, died of a blood infection after developing a fist-sized bedsore while being treated at Southend University Hospital. The sore was so deep it left her spine exposed

But her family’s lawyers say the hospital failed in a number of ways.

They say Miss Etty, from Canvey Island in Essex, should have been given an air mattress as recommended in Nice guidelines to prevent pressure sores.

They also claim hospital failed to implement a care management plan ensuring Miss Etty was regularly turned and moved to prevent pressure sores, despite staff being aware that she was at risk of developing them.

They added that staff failed for three days to send a nurse to assess her skin, despite a referral being made.

The lawyers also claim the hospital regularly failed to monitor and assess Miss Etty and did not diagnose the pressure sore until it was classed as grade three - grade five is the most serious.

Her niece, Lynda Clifford, was told Miss Etty was having a routine operation and she would be back home within days, but two months later, she died of a blood infection after suffering a terrible wound which exposed the base of her spine and left her crying out in agony.

Miss Etty's niece, Lynda Clifford (pictured) said: 'It was horrific to see her suffer so much, but there was nothing I could do because the wound had been left untreated for so long'

On July 25, Miss Etty went on a brief visit home with two occupational therapists for them to assess her requirements for when she was discharged from hospital.

It was then that the severity of the former pharmaceutical assistant’s condition was discovered by her niece.

Although the sore continued to worsen, Miss Etty was discharged to a care home where she died on September 7.

Mrs Clifford said: ‘The care home staff were fantastic and did everything they could to try and make my aunt comfortable.

‘However, by this point the sore had become so deep and infected and she cried in pain as it was re-dressed.

The family has received a £20,000 out of court settlement from the NHS Litigation Authority. Mrs Clifford says she believed her aunt would return home from hospital once she had had a hip replacement

‘It was horrific to see her suffer so much, but there was nothing I could do because the wound had been left untreated for so long.

‘Florence Nightingale said one of the first things nurses should learn is how to deal with the elderly and infirm. Molly couldn’t move herself very well so I can’t understand why she wasn’t immediately put on a special mattress.’

Sue Hardy, chief nurse at Southend University Hospital, said: ‘We would like to take this opportunity to extend our sympathies to the family of Miss Etty.

‘We understand that this case will be the subject of an inquest and it would therefore be inappropriate to comment further.’
