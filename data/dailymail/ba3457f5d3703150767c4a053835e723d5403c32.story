A woman, 72, from Honolulu has been blind for over two years but thanks to her new bionic eye she will miraculously be able to see again.

The elderly Japanese woman underwent the four hour procedure at the Eye Surgery Center of Hawaii on Tuesday and is the first person to receive the implant in the Asia Pacific region.

The woman's identity will not be released.  

CBS reports that the bionic eye only works for those who have the hereditary disease, retinitis pigmentosa which causes vision impairment.

Groundbreaking surgery: A woman, 72, from Honolulu has been blind for over two years but thanks to her new bionic eye implanted on Tuesday she will be able to see again

Blind: The Japanese woman, 72, has been blind for two years due to a condition called retinitis pigmentosa

Dr. Gregg Kokame, who performed the operation, said that the bionic eye will help the woman start to see motion and different shades of grey.

'She'll actually start to see motion, actually start to see somebody walk into the room and be able to see different shades of grey,' Kokame said.

The device which was approved by the food and drug administration costs $144,000 but was covered by Medicare for the patient, reported ABC.

Before the surgery the woman was only able to perceive some light and was otherwise totally blind.

The surgical team restored the woman's vision by implanting a microelectrode array to the surface of the woman's retina that then connects wirelessly to a camera connected to a pair of glasses.

The woman will not able to see very close details or any color but she may someday have a broader range of vision as the technology advances.

New light: The woman won't be able to see color but she will be able to detect motion and prior to her surgery was barely able to detect light 

Camera eye: The bionic eye sends signals to the brain through glasses that have a camera and as the technology improves the woman will be able to see more and more 

The woman will be able to use her new device in two weeks after she is fully healed from the surgery.

'She was in very good spirits, ‘Kokame said.

'She's a very pleasant, very strong lady. She's looking forward to having the implant turned on.'

Bionic eye implant inventor Dr. Mark Humayan told Hawaii News Now that he hopes the device will evolve to assist more patients.

'We have hundreds of millions of photo receptors in our eye, hundreds of millions, and with only 60 pixels patients who were completely blind can see large objects, can tell a table from a chair or a knife from a fork or a plate so it's very exciting to see what the brain is able to fill in,' Humayan said.

Medical expert: 'She'll actually start to see motion, actually start to see somebody walk into the room and be able to see different shades of grey,' Dr. Kokame said

First of its kind: The procedure conducted on Tuesday was the first of its kind in the Asia-Pacific region and took over 25 years to develop
