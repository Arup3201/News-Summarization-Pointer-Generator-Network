He had his hind legs amputated at just a few weeks old after being born with a severe deformity. 

But not only has the Boxer puppy overcome his disability by running on his front paws, he also has a specially adapted wheelchair - and gives his friend lifts.

The 16-week-old Boxer called Duncan Lou Who carts puppy Ducky around and animal shelter staff say he is much more confident using the wheelchair when his friend is with him.

He was learning to walk in the adapted cart when the puppy jumped onto the back, staff said

Duncan Lou Who was forced to have an operation just one month ago to give him the best chance of life after being born with a severe leg deformity.

The bones in his legs were completely fused and the decision was made to amputate.

But rather than being hindered by his disability, Panda Paws Rescue, in Vancouver, say he has taken to life on two legs.

Although initially wary of his wheelchair, Amanda Giese from the rescue centre said he was more confident when his friend Ducky hopped on the back of the 'lime green spaceship'. 

Story of Boxer Duncan Lou's recovery from double hind leg amputation has been shared around the world

He was born with four legs but his hind legs fused shortly after birth and he had to have them amputated

She told King5: 'Ducky climbed onto the back of his space ship and instantly Duncan felt more confident.

'You could see his whole posture change, his eyes lit up, he wanted to go go go  and run with the others.'

She said Ducky is going to have 'plenty of chariot rides' with his friend.

He has many chairs and is still learning to use them.

Duncan Lou Who's story has been shared
around the world and one video of him running on his two front legs has
been viewed 550,000 times.

Staff at Panda Paw Rescue say he can do everything a four-legged dog can do including run

The rescue centre say he has never been in any pain and does everything a four-legged dog can do.

He is given daily physical therapy to try to keep his deformed spine from worsening.

The puppy is even taken into a hydrotherapy pool and is helped through stretches and massages.

In four weeks of therapy his spine has been turned from a 90 degree contortion to a 45 degree contortion.

The curve in his spine is similar to that of a seahorse, according to staff.
