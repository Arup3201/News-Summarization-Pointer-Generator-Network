This week has been like, so hot. Literally. There's been a mini heat wave in New York City and so we were in dire need of some alfresco pool action in the city.

Thankfully my friend Stacey Jackson (who is a native New Yorker) was on hand to gain Jamie Laing and I access to a private pool on the roof of an achingly hip members club.

You had to be up early to get a sun-lounger (they were all gone by 8am) and they were like gold dust. During the day I watched a couple of women hovering by one pool chair for over an hour because they believed it was about to be vacated.

Sun's out, guns out: Spencer and Jamie enjoyed a spot of sunbathing this week at an exclusive members rooftop pool in NYC

Luckily our friends had managed to hold us a couple of seats, and so we lay down in the sun and surveyed the surrounding company of stylish 20 and 30-something hard-body creatives from behind a pair of dark Wayfarers.

Thankfully I'm in pretty good nick at the moment, thanks to the bumper supply of Forza T5 supplements that I brought out with me, so it was a case of, 'Sun's Out, Guns Out' round the pool.

The drinks started flowing and it was a beautiful day with an ugly bar bill at the end of it.

We were meant to have an early night but someone would have had to handcuffed us to the bed to make us miss the Governor's Ball after-show party.

I was glad at that point that we hadn't brought the Lovehoney handcuffs with us to NYC. (We would never have got them through airport security anyway).

The party was at the Electric Rooms club and I bumped into Kills guitarist Jamie Hince fresh from his main-stage performance at the event. He was on good form but sadly Mrs Hince (none other than Kate Moss) wasn't at the party.

United nations: Spencer is keen to enhance the 'special relationship' between the UK and the USA

We managed to make a quite few new American friends at the bar further enhancing the 'special relationship' between our two great nations.

It's now the end of the week and I'm concerned that I've not planned ahead for Father's Day.

Unfortunately it's not likely that I'm going to be able to see him on the day, so online delivery from high-end toiletries retailer escentual.com looks the best option.

First I thought of some LAB Series Age-Less Face Cream, I use it quite a bit,  but dad's generation might still not be ready for a daily moisturizer.

A safer bet would be the Acqua di Parma Collezione Barbiere Shaving Cream. Shaving is always a bit of a drag, (which is why you often see me with a beard) but this product makes the experience almost enjoyable.

Lots of Love, and Happy Father's Day from Spencer.

Spencer recommends the Acqua di Parma Collezione Barbiere Shaving Cream for Father's Day as way of taking the chore out of shaving
