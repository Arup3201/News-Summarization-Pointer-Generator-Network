New Justice Secretary Chris Grayling today struck a tougher tone on criminal policy

Chris Grayling yesterday ripped up Kenneth Clarke’s hugely  controversial policy of seeking to reduce the prison population.

In his first appearance before MPs as Justice Secretary, Mr Grayling took a far harder line on law and order than his predecessor.

He told the Commons: ‘The only changes I want to see to the prison population will come through returning more foreign national prisoners to their countries of origin.’

Mr Clarke, who was shifted to the post of minister without portfolio in this month’s Cabinet reshuffle, had angered backbench MPs by shifting away from the party’s  traditional view that ‘prison works’.

He claimed that ‘just banging up more and more people for longer without actively seeking to change them is what you would expect of Victorian England’.

But Mr Grayling yesterday said his strategy for making room in packed jails would be to try to deport more foreign convicts to serve their sentences overseas.

Our jails contain inmates from 156 countries – more than three out of every four nations in the world.

The total number of foreign prisoners has risen despite pledges by David Cameron to fix the problem.

By March this year, there were 11,127 behind bars, at an estimated cost to the UK public purse of more than £420million. Mr Grayling and his ministers said they wanted to make it a priority to pursue more prisoner transfer agreements so they can be sent home.

He also pledged to do ‘a much better job on the rehabilitation of offenders, so far fewer people come back to prison’.

Ken Clarke had promised to cut prison numbers when he was Justice Secretary

His comments were applauded by Tory MPs who had been highly critical of Mr Clarke for pursuing ‘soft justice’ policies.

Initially, Mr Clarke wanted to slash the prison population by 6,000. He abandoned a Tory election promise to make jail sentences mandatory for youths carrying a knife and proposed huge discounts for rapists and other convicts who admitted guilt at the first possibility. Even after the sentencing discount plan was ditched, following the intervention of No 10, he was still committed to cutting the number behind bars by 2,000.

The prison population has been falling recently – down to 86,000, compared with the all-time high of 88,179 in December last year.

Mr Clarke also shied away from the full-blooded confrontation with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg which many Tory supporters wanted to see after the row over whether prisoners should be allowed to vote.

The Ministry of Justice is struggling to balance its books after Mr Clarke agreed to slash £2billion for the department’s £9billion budget.

Labour criticised Mr Grayling for shifting away from his predecessor’s policy on prisons and complained about the loss of Mr Clarke from the post. MP Paul Flynn said: ‘We’ve lost one of the few civilised, vintage politicians, who demonstrated that he had a working brain, and that he understood the benefits of remedial work in prison. Haven’t we sadly exchanged old lace for arsenic?’

Mr Grayling replied: ‘He can go on thinking what he likes, but as I’ve made absolutely clear, I also see it as a priority to ensure that we make sure we tackle the rehabilitation challenge and that we stop people going back to prison again and again.’
