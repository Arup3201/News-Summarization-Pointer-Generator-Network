Greeks claim they are the hardest-working European nation, despite their 'bad kebab' economy.

In a poll of residents of eight of Europe's leading nations, seven agreed that Germany is the hardest working country on the continent.

The exception was Greece, whose citizens claim they are Europe's hardest workers.

Greek perceptions come despite the precarious state of their national finances, which commentators have claimed must be due to some extent to a national culture of laziness.

Indeed, the people of Britain, Germany, Spain, Poland, and the Czech Republic all accused the Greeks of being the least hardworking Europeans, undoubtedly due to the problems the country faces.

This week Jeremy Paxman came under fire for blasting the Greek economy as a 'bad kebab' which may best be 'vomited out' by the rest of the eurozone.

The Newsnight presenter was given a 
tongue-lashing by a Greek guest and criticised on Twitter after his 
comments, which were branded 'offensive' and 'disrespectful' to the 
country and its people.

Anger: Live on air Mr Paxman said Greece could be vomited out of the Euro like a bad kebab, to the anger of a guest

The abrasive BBC journalist was 
describing Greece's political and financial problems when he used the 
'bad kebab' analogy to explain what the rest of the Eurozone may want to
do with them.

But after he was criticised Mr Paxman backed down, not defending his analogy.

Greece has another election in mid-June, which could decide whether or not they stay in the Euro.

But
as pro and anti-bailout parties are neck and neck in the polls another 
stalemate is possible, which could force Euro countries like Germany and
France to throw them out themselves.

'So the rest of the Eurozone now contemplates something we were being 
told wasn't conceivable recently, that, like a bad kebab, Greece is 
vomited out of the single European currency, ' Mr Paxman said.

But former Greek finance minister Giorgos Papakonstantinou then turned on him and told him off live on air.

'I take issue with your bad kebab analogy, which I find offensive,' he said.

'The
Greek economy is in a crisis and the Greek people are going through a 
lot and they deserve some respect. I really did not find that very 
appropriate.'

In fact, Hellenic perceptions of their own efforts are rather more in tune with reality than it may seem from their current difficulties.

Recent data from the OECD showed Greeks actually do work the longest hours in Europe, toiling an average of 2,017 hours a year - compared to 1,647 in the UK, or a leisurely 1,408 in Germany.

However, working longer hours does not necessarily lead to greater productivity, and Greece's productivity is low, relative to other European economies.

Corruption is also a major problem, with Greece viewed by other Europeans as having the second highest levels after Mafia-ridden Italy, and Greeks regard their own land as the most corrupt of all.

Germany was regarded as the least corrupt by those polled.
