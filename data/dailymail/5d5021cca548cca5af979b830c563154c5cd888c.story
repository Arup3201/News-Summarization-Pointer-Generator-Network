Shift: New NHS chief executive Simon Stevens will urge more treatment of patients in their communities

The new boss of the National Health Service is calling for the return of cottage hospitals.

Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said Britain had suffered from too much centralisation.

In a major speech next week, he will urge more treatment of patients within their communities and a move away from the large impersonal hospitals which currently dominate the country’s health landscape.

The move would be a major U-turn on the health policies of recent governments. Mr Stevens said that British hospitals had become some of the worst in western Europe and that the NHS should look to other countries for ways to improve the healthcare system.

He said: ‘A number of other countries have found it possible to run viable local hospitals serving smaller communities than sometimes we think are sustainable in the NHS.

Most of western Europe has hospitals which are able to serve their local communities, without everything having to be centralised.’

Cottage hospitals were originally envisioned as smaller buildings in communities which stopped people having to travel long distances for treatment in larger hospitals where they were all but anonymous. Instead, they would be treated locally.

In recent years, many have been closed or phased out in favour of huge general hospitals which, it is argued, can be run more efficiently with economies of scale.

Critics claim patients are swallowed up by the system and in many cases do not receive care that is sufficiently designed to meet their needs as an individual.

Mr Stevens said the NHS needed to abandon its fixation with ‘mass centralisation’ and instead invest in community services to care for an ageing population. He also revealed that he felt Labour’s waiting time target culture had become an ‘impediment’ to care in many cases.

Mr Stevens, a 47-year-old Briton, gave up a lucrative private healthcare job in America to work for the NHS in the £211,000-a year-role, for which he is taking a voluntary ten per cent pay cut.

Poisoned chalice: The NHS top job saw Mr Stevens's predecessor dubbed 'the man with no shame'

He will give a major speech next Wednesday laying out his vision for the organisation.

The job is regarded in some quarters as a poisoned chalice.

His predecessor, Sir David Nicholson, was dubbed the ‘man with no shame’ over his refusal to take responsibility for various NHS scandals, most damagingly the neglect of patients at Mid Staffordshire NHS trust.

Mr Stevens said he believes the biggest question facing the NHS is how best to support older people, pointing out figures which show that two-thirds of hospital patients are over retirement age – yet services are not designed around their needs.

Condemning the lack of ‘dignity and compassion’ with which vulnerable older patients are treated, Mr Stevens told the Telegraph that  care failings often occurred because systems were not designed around their needs, and called for local services to be expanded.

‘You cannot have a modern health service that is not treating older patients with dignity and compassion, supporting them at home and ensuring targeted prevention [of ill health],’ he said.

Vulnerable patients are frequently ending up in hospital because they had not received basic help when they needed it, resulting in falls and other avoidable incidents, he suggested.
