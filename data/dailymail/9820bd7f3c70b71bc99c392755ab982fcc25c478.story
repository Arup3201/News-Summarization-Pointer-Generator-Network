Petrol prices have fallen to their lowest level in three years, new figures have revealed.

The drop means a family with two cars is paying roughly £11.90 less a month on fuel for each vehicle.

Prices have been driven down because of falling decline from countries such as China.

But motoring campaigners have warned the costs could soon rise dramatically because of Russia’s annexation of the Crimea.

Earlier this month wholesale gas prices reached their highest levels in two years as markets reacted to the crisis in Ukraine, prompting fears fuel could be affected as a result.

The cost of crude oil also rose – driven by fears that Russia, which is a major producer, might be hit by trade sanctions.

A spokesman for the AA told the Daily Mirror: ‘You don’t get much more unstable than Russia invading another country.'

The good news for motorists has also been offset by a real-terms plunge in earnings which has pushed wages back to 2002 levels, according to the AA Fuel Price Report.

In an effort to support drivers, George Osborne announced in his Budget this week another fuel duty freeze.
