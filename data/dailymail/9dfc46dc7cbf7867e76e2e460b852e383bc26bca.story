Lengthy jail terms were handed out to four men on Thursday after they tortured a Perth drug dealer and left him disabled.

Cyril Mansour, his brother Serji, Andy Mannah and Niraj Singh, all flew to Perth from Sydney in November 2011, and lured Gary Visanich, 43,to a house in Bentley.

They assaulted Mr Visanich for hours and he suffered multiple injuries including burns and severe lacerations that were contaminated with dirt. Cigarette butts were also found deep in his throat. After being tortured Mr Visanich was driven to a nearby park and dumped beside rubbish bins.

The Perth trip had been arranged by Cyril Mansour to recover a drug debt of up to $150,000 owed to him by Mr Visanich.

ABC reported that District Court Judge Julie Wager said Mr Visanich could no longer live independently and could not look after himself without supervision.

Judge Wager described what was done to Mr Visanich as 'degrading', 'disgusting' and 'cruel'.

'It is that chilling that you made the premeditated decision to fly-in and fly-out and behave in this manner,' she said.

Judge Wager said Cyril Mansour was the 'principal offender' who had sent threatening text messages to Mr Visanich in the days before he was assaulted.

Cyril Mansour was sentenced to 12 years' jail, while his brother Serji and Mannah were each given eight years. Singh was sentenced to nine-and-a-half years.

A fifth man who dumped Mr Visanich in the park was sentenced to two years and nine months in jail.
