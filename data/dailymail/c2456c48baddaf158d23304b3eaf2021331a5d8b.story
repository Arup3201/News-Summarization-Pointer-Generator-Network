Two daring adventurers battled sharks, storms and drug smugglers during their world record for paddleboarding the longest distance. 

Arron Ford and Robert Cunliffe, both 24, spent six hours every day for 44 days paddling in sweltering heat during their mammoth 380 mile journey off the coast of Panama. 

They beat the previous record - set by Wyatt Werneth in 2007 - despite encountering various setbacks along the way.

Mr Cunliffe (pictured) said: 'We're immensely relieved to have broken this record. Thankfully we were well prepared because Panama threw the kitchen sink at us, we could not have chosen a harder place to do this'

The friends were robbed by turtle egg poachers on their first night and had to hide from drug smugglers who landed on an island they were camping on

Halfway through their paddleboarding journey, Mr Cunliffe, 24, suffered second degree burns when a stove broke and sent boiling water pouring over his feet, which meant an evacuation from the coastline and a five-day stay in hospital

Halfway through the journey, Mr Cunliffe suffered second degree burns when a stove broke and sent boiling water pouring over his feet, which meant an evacuation from the coastline and a five-day stay in hospital. 

The pair were also robbed by turtle egg poachers on their first night and were forced to take refuge from drug smugglers who landed on an island they were camping on.

And during a break, a bull shark even tried to nibble on their biscuits. 

The friends underwent the challenge to raise awareness for environmental charity, Seacology 

The pair were looking for the endangered Antillean Manatee, also known as the 'Sea Cow' and found two previously unknown populations of the mammal on their journey

The paddleboarding record, off the coast of Panama, took 44 days in incredibly hot conditions 

Conservation graduate Mr Ford, 24, said: 'After 3 years studying critically endangered animals, it was fantastic to get out into the wild and conduct some primary research during our own project'

Medical student Mr Cunliffe and conservation graduate Mr Ford did the challenge to raise awareness for environmental charity Seacology. 

The friends, who travelled with 25kg on their boards, were looking for the endangered Antillean Manatee - sometimes referred to as a 'Sea Cow' - and discovered two previously unknown populations of the mammal on their journey. 

Mr Ford said: 'It was an amazing experience filled with constant surprises every day.

'Nothing since has felt so exciting and I'm already planning the next eco-adventure.

'After 3 years studying critically endangered animals, it was fantastic to get out into the wild and conduct some primary research during our own project.

'With less than 3000 Antillean Manatee remaining, finding two new populations was more than we could have dreamed of and a glimmer of hope for a beautiful and graceful animal that deserves protection.'

The Brits broke the previous paddleboarding record by 34.8 miles during their trek off the coast of Panama

Mr Cunliffe, a medical student, said: 'It's great that the record for a sport dominated by Aussies, American and Hawaiians is now held by two Brits'

One of the pair, Mr Cunliffe, said: 'We just want to say thank you to everyone who supported this journey'

Mr Cunliffe added: 'We're immensely relieved to have broken this record and proud of the style in which we have done it, making some really exciting discoveries along the way.

'Thankfully we were well prepared because Panama literally threw the kitchen sink at us, we could not have chosen a harder place to do this.

'It's also great that the record for a sport dominated by Aussies, American and Hawaiians is now held by two Brits.

'We just want to say thank you to everyone who supported this journey.'
