Gareth Southgate believes Luke Shaw finally understands what it takes to be deemed 'world class' after training alongside Manchester United team-mates Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria. 

Shaw has featured twice for United this season since arriving from Southampton in a £31million move in the summer.

The 19-year-old was one of many additions made by boss Louis van Gaal along with Di Maria and Falcao.

The South American duo have both impressed during their short time in English football with the pair on the scoresheet in the Red Devils' 2-1 win against Everton in their last Premier League match before the international break.

According to Southgate, Shaw, who played in both legs of England Under 21s' European Championship play-off success against Croatia, now realises what is required to be a truly great player having been in the presence of Di Maria and Falcao.

'I think what he now has is a recognition of what 'world class' looks like,' Southgate told the Mirror.

'He might have had an idea of what he thought it was before, but training at Manchester United with the likes of Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria has given him a full understanding of the concept now.

'He would have known there was a level, but now he knows there is a level above that.'

Southgate also added that Shaw has been so impressed by the pair's quality that he even told his Under 21 international team-mates. 

'He was able to share those stories among our lads in the U21s because all players at times in their careers think they are nearly there - and then you discover you still have a bit of a way to go,' Southgate said.

'You continually have to strive to be better than you are and Luke realises that now.'
