Former Manchester United manager David Moyes has turned to Spain to rebuild his managerial career, as the Scot takes his Real Sociedad side to Deportivo La Coruna on Saturday evening.

Moyes, who endured a torrid season at the helm at Old Trafford is quoted in Spanish paper Marca: 'I'm nervous and emotional about my first game.'

He has certainly taken up a tough challenge in La Liga, with Real Sociedad struggling for form and just out of the relegation zone on goal difference in 15th place.  

The Real Madrid squad will wear custom shorts in support of their colleague Luka Modric at Eibar on Saturday

Marca leads with the headline 'Modric spirit' after the Croatian midfielder left the clinic that treated Rafael Nadal's persistent knee troubles on Friday after he was ruled out for three months having torn a tendon in his thigh.

The Spanish paper also reveals the Real Madrid squad will wear special shorts supporting their team-mate Modric against Eibar on Saturday as Los Blancos aim for a 14th consecutive victory.

Sami Khedira is set to replace Modric in the heart of Madrid's midfield, perhaps scuppering a January move to the Premier League for the German, who has been heavily linked with Arsenal and Chelsea since the summer.

However Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti said: 'We will solve the problem because we have Kroos and Khedira as a World Cup-winning pairing and Isco can also play there.'

La Gazzetta dello Sport is building up to the Milan derby which is Roberto Mancini's first game back at Inter

La Gazzetta dello Sport have asked Andriy Shevchenko and Diego Milito for their say ahead of the Milan derby on Sunday.

AC and Inter are placed seventh and ninth respectively in Serie A but the bitter rivalry has greater significance with Roberto Mancini's first game back in charge at Inter. 

Rossonero legend Shevchenko has signaled out Chelsea's on-loan striker Fernando Torres for praise despite only scoring once since arriving at the San Siro this summer.

'Inzaghi is enthusiastic and fired up, just like when he was playing. Fernando Torres is great and I expect Milan to push forward,' said Shevchenko.

Meanwhile Milito, who won the treble at Inter in 2010, has backed former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini to be a success again back at Inter, where he previously won three Serie A titles.

'Mancini is preparing another great Inter, just like before Mou (Jose Mourinho). I am betting on Rodrigo Palacio to score the winner.'   

The Portuguese press, including A Bola, praise Fredy Montero after Sporting Lisbon's cup win at Espinho

Corriere dello Sport has an interview with controversial Sampdoria President Massimo Ferrero, with his side currently forth in Serie A and eight points behind league leaders Juventus.

Ferrero has to publicly apologise recently for referring to Inter Milan's Indonesian owner Erick Thohir as 'that Filipino'.

In Corriere dello Sport Ferrero claims: 'I will win the Scudetto with Sampdoria. Who said a big club has to get the title?'

After the Thohir incident Ferrero, the paper claims, jokes with Filipino fans who send in messages: 'Okaka stays. He will sign a new contract and I'll only sell to Real Madrid... I love Mihajlovic. He deserves a big club, but he'll be my Boskov.'

Meanwhile Portuguese paper A Bola highlights the scoring prowess of 'Sharp Shooter' Fredy Montero after the Colombian inspired a five goal thrashing of minows Espinho in the Portuguese Cup.
