Britain is at 'very significant risk' from a terror attack by extremists inspired by ISIS jihadis, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond warned today.

Speaking ahead of a counter-terror summit in London today, he warned against complacency in the fight to 'disrupt these plots before they come to the stage of an attack'.

David Cameron met Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in Downing Street, where he vowed the UK would do 'everything we can' to stop the flow of foreign fighters who were travelling to join ISIS and cause 'mayhem'.

Speaking in No 10, Mr Cameron said: 'The threat from extremist terror you face in Iraq is also a threat we face here in the United Kingdom ... We will do everything we can to help stop foreign fighters coming to your country and creating the mayhem we see today.'

Later Mr Abadi will join representatives from 21 countries, including US secretary of state John Kerry and French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, for talks which will focus on military support for fighters battling against ISIS - also known as Isil, as well as by its Arabic acronym Daesh.

Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hammond stressed the danger of terror attack in the UK by people inspired by events in Iraq and Syria.

'We have to regard Isil as probably the greatest single immediate threat to Britain's national security at the moment,' the Foreign Secretary told BBC1's Breakfast.

'There's a very significant risk of an Isil-inspired attack being planned and, if we are not successful in intercepting it, executed by Isil sympathisers who live in the UK but are inspired by what is going on in Iraq and Syria.

'Of course, our security and intelligence agencies, our police forces are working tirelessly around the clock to monitor, to identify, to intercept and to disrupt plots of this nature, and we've been very successful in doing so, but we mustn't be complacent.

'We know there are people out there who wish us harm and we have to be vigilant and we have to work extremely hard to make sure we identify and disrupt these plots before they come to the stage of an attack.'

But he warned that Iraq's security forces will not be ready for months to take on ISIS fighters who have seized large swathes of the country.

The Foreign Secretary acknowledged that despite huge sums spent by the United States and Britain on Iraq's security forces in the years following the ousting of Saddam Hussein, they had fallen back into a 'state of disarray'.

'There is a big challenge ahead of us,' he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.

'We are renewing and regenerating the Iraqi security forces - re-equipping them, retraining them, reorganising them - but it will be months yet before they are ready to start significant combat operations against Isil.'

Air strikes by Britain and its allies had 'very effectively' contained ISIS while action was taken to 'rebuild' the Iraqi armed forces to enable them to drive the militants out of their country, he said, adding: 'They will be able to do it, the question is when they will be ready to start that process.'
