In what will put a smile on the face of Football fans worldwide, Holland legend Marco van Basten looked well on the mend as he celebrated his 50th birthday at the home of his former side AZ Alkmaar on Friday.

Van Basten was forced to step down as manager of the Dutch side last month following persistent health problems.

It was reported in the Dutch media that Van Basten had been suffering heart palpitations and extreme stress in the wake of his father passing away in July.

Van Basten was accompanied by friends and members of staff as he savoured the big day, being presented with a personalised cake and personalised shirt, both with the No 50 on them.

The sooner we see Van Basten back in Football the better, and on this evidence it will be sooner rather than later.
