England's Autumn internationals have proven anything but a success so far, but that hasn't stopped Stuart Lancaster looking at experiments for his struggling side.

With Samoa next up on Saturday, Stuart Lancaster's team will be keen to end a run of five straight defeats when they take on the world's 11th ranked side at Twickenham.

But rather than sticking with a formula that hasn't worked in recent tests against New Zealand and South Africa, Lancaster will play George Ford at No 10, with Owen Farrell moving to No 12.

It will be a tactical switch under the spotlight when the teams clash at Twickenham on Saturday, but inside the stadium on Friday it was a much more private affair as next year's World Cup hosts underwent a captain's run session under the overcast London skies.

Ford trained alongside Farrell, who has been Lancaster's first choice No 10 for much of his reign but has struggled with fitness concerns relating to a thigh problem.

England looked in good spirits during the training session and having lost to New Zealand and South Africa during the Autumn internationals will hope to end their slump when they face Samoa before a final clash with Australia the following Saturday.
