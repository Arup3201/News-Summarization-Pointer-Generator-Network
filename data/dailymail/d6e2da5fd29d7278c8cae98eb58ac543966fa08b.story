Karen Danczuk jetted out of the UK today after it emerged the brother she accuses of sexually abusing her is being questioned over separate allegations.

Mrs Danczuk - the wife of Labour MP Simon Danczuk - looked tired as she entered Manchester Airport this morning to fly overseas.

She left the UK after it emerged her brother, who she has accused of abusing her when she was still a schoolgirl, has been re-arrested over further sex abuse claims by two other women.

Mrs Danczuk flew away for a break  three weeks after she first made the allegations public, before making a complaint to the police.

A source said: 'Everything had become a bit much for her and she's decided to go away for a few days and just get out of the country.'

Last month, Mrs Danczuk – who became well-known for posting revealing 'selfie' pictures of herself on Twitter – claimed she was raped by a family member ‘hundreds of times’ between the ages of six and 12.

She did not name her attacker initially, but her brother, Michael Burke, was later arrested.

Last week, the 36-year-old vehemently denied the claims, saying: ‘The allegations are false. I’m just so shocked and disgusted by it all.’

Mrs Danczuk, 31, has said she starting posting ‘selfies’ after feeling she can now ‘have fun without being ashamed of myself’.

Her husband Simon, Labour MP for Rochdale since 2010, has been a vociferous campaigner against child abuse and those who cover up such crimes.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said yesterday: ‘A man has been rearrested on suspicion of historic sexual offences.

‘This relates to officers speaking to a woman on February 16, 2015, regarding historic sexual abuse and new information coming to light. He remains in police custody for questioning.’

It is not known when the fresh offences are alleged to have taken place.

But Greater Manchester Police were already investigating Mr Burke over claims that he sexually abused his sister between 1989 and 1995.
