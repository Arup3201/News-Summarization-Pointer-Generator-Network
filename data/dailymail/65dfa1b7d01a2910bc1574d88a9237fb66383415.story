In 2005, Kristine Matheson was told she had between six and 12 months left to live.

The Gold Coast woman had tumours on her lungs and her lymph nodes and was told the cancer was inoperable because it was so close to her aorta.

Nine years later Mrs Matheson, 64, is still alive – a feat she claims is thanks to the mostly raw, vegan diet that 'cured' her cancer.

Now she runs seminars around Australia, retreats in Byron Bay, and has released a book to teach other cancer sufferers that they can heal themselves by changing their diet.

But one of Australia's leading oncologists warns it is 'dangerous' to shun conventional medicine based on one woman's personal experience.

Kristine Matheson (pictured right, with her husband Wayne) in 2012 was told she had had cancer in 2005 and had between six and 12 months left to live. Nine years later she is still alive

'I don't condemn anyone for exploring all sorts of options when they have cancer but I think they should explore conventional medicine and not go off someone else's story,' said Ian Olver, CEO of Cancer Council Australia.

Mrs Matheson said when she found out she had cancer she was told she was not able to undergo chemotherapy or radiation.

Her doctor Dzung Price, a registered GP who combines conventional medicine with alternative treatments, said Mrs Matheson had a malignant melanoma that metastasised.

'It went from her skin to the lymph nodes in her chest behind her sternum,' Dr Price said.

'That's why they couldn't do chemo or radiotherapy on her, it's not a good area to do that.'

Mrs Matheson said she wouldn't have considered either option even if they had been available.

'My husband beat cancer four years before I met him in 1984, and he opened me up to a lot of pathways to natural healing,' she said.

'I did nothing except the diet, mediation and positive affirmations.

'If we dealt with the cause and stopped eating so much junk food there wouldn't be so much cancer.'

Dr Price said she believed Mrs Matheson's diet was 'a big part of' why she got better.

'She had a belief system that allowed her to get well,' she said.

'I see a lot of patients that choose not to go down that path [of conventional treatment] and it does happen [that they get better], especially when people aren't given any other options.

'I usually suggest people have an integrated approach and take the best of both worlds.'

After her diagnosis, Mrs Matheson started a month-long eating program to get rid of the candida in her gut.

She was already a vegan, but she also cut out sugar, fruit, coffee, alcohol, dairy, yeast and anything fermented.

Next, she embarked on a 28-day cleanse, consuming fruit juices, vegetable broths and herbal teas only.

After that was finished, she started following an 80 percent raw, mostly vegan diet – one that she still follows now.

'My breakfast every morning is still the same, I have fruit salads and cashew cream,' Mrs Matheson said.

'I soak a cup of cashews for an hour or two or overnight then I put that in my blender with three cups of water and mix that up until it's think and creamy.'

The 64-year-old occasionally drinks a glass of wine, and if she eats out she might have a piece of cooked fish with some salad.

Mrs Matheson says that five months after she started her diet program, she felt like her cancer was gone.

'The tumours sticking out of my neck were gone totally,' she said.

'I used to get breathless, because it was on my lungs, and I no longer did.

'I knew I was clean, I just knew.'

A year later, she had a CT scan and an MRI to prove it.

'I didn't want to, but my mother said "Why don't you get checked out, people are going to ask you",' Mrs Matheson said.

'My doctor sent me to a surgeon and they just said "You're clear".'

Mrs Matheson started getting contacted by people – some who had cancer and others worried they were going to get it – asking her for tips. In 2009 she decided to write a step-by-step guide.

She says she knows of 30 people who have cured their cancer by following her methods – and estimates there are thousands of others out there who have bought her book that she's never heard from.

When Mrs Matheson received her diagnosis in 2005 she and her husband Wayne Matheson, 69, were in the middle of a court case because the property development company they ran was defrauded of $7 million.

The couple lost everything and Mrs Matheson believes the stress of the ordeal contributed to her cancer.

'Through that process I stopped eating properly, I was eating too much cooked food,' she said.

'The stress got to me and I couldn't believe these people we're so dishonest.'

Now they live in a rental property in Robina and their main source of income is the retreat program they run out of Byron Bay every couple of months.

They rent out a property for a group of nine to 10 people, charging them $2347 each for the weekend, where they do meditation exercises and eat raw food.

The Mathesons also run seminars, with one scheduled in Mackay in Queensland later this month, and they have plans to travel around the country next year.

'I always get letters from all over the place asking "Are you ever going to come here?"' she said.

The seminars cost between $28 and $147 – depending on how far the couple have to travel and whether food and recipe books are included.

Mrs Matheson doesn't have any health or science qualifications, and everything she teaches is based on her own personal experience.

Her husband is currently studying a bachelor of health science in naturopathy and muscular skeletal therapy.

'One of the reasons why Wayne is doing naturopathy is that as I get bigger out there and more well-known, he felt if he can do naturopathy then one of us has got a certificate in case we ever get questioned,' she said.

Mrs Matheson says she doesn't charge the people who get in contact with her directly asking for advice – and only accepts money if they insist.

'I do meals, I do Skype and I don't charge anybody,' she said.

'The reason I don't charge is that I feel that everybody that's got cancer, when they're searching to get well, all these people are waiting for them to walk in the door and take advantage of them because they're sick.

'If the integrity's in what I do and they're going to get well they've got to believe in what I'm giving to them and not what they're paying for.'

Mrs Matheson also says that she is doesn't tell people outright that they shouldn't undergo more conventional cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation – she just tries to steer them in another direction.

'I'm not going to tell people what to do, they've got to make their own educated judgement,' she said.

'Mind you I tell them they've got to be crazy... I wouldn't do it to my body.

'The bottom line is I'll try and convince them to focus on nutrition.'

Cancer Council Australia CEO Mr Olver warned cancer sufferers against following dietary programs such as Mrs Matheson's in place of conventional treatments.

'I'm obviously pleased that she's well but I think everyone has got to look at what treatments are available,' Mr Olver said.

'She's told her story which is fine, but extrapolating that and saying everyone should abandon proven cancer treatments, to say everyone should try changing their diet instead, is dangerous.'

Mr Olver said two thirds of patients diagnosed with cancer today will still be alive in five years' time, which is an improvement since 10 years ago.

'Even if the treatment worked what we don't know is does it work one out of every two occasions, one out of every 100?' he said.

'I think people should explore options but I think they've got to ask questions like how does this apply to me and how often does it work.'
