Two Florida men who were being pulled over for running a red light are now facing drug charges after a botched effort to ditch a bag of cocaine.

Police on patrol in Kissimmee say they had to slam on their brakes at an intersection on Michigan Avenue about 2am Wednesday after a gold Acura didn't stop for the red light.

The cops flashed their lights for the car to pull over and shined a spotlight on the vehicle, noticing that the sunroof was being opened.

'I observed the front right seat passenger throw a clear baggie filled with cocaine that landed on the roof of my vehicle,' Kissimmee officer Christopher Breuer wrote in his police report, according to The Smoking Gun.

Flying cocaine: Driver Jose Vales, 38 (left), was pulled over for allegedly running a red light in Kissimmee early Wednesday, when passenger Luis Vazquez, 30 (right) flung a bag of cocaine out the sunroof of the car

The car pulled into a nearby 7-11.

Breuer said in his report that he hadn't told the two men in the car he had observed the bag being thrown when the driver, Jose Vales, 38, told him it was the passenger, Luis Vazquez, 30, who threw it.

'Vales spontaneously uttered to me that it was Vazquez that threw the ‘baggie’ out of the window,' Breuer reported.

Police asked the men if there was anything else illegal to be found in the car and they said no.

However a search showed driver Vales had a bag of cocaine - the same type recovered from the police car-  in his front right pocket.

Vales told police that Vasquez had planted the drugs on him. 

'I asked Vales how did Vasquez do that and Vales stated that he was asked by Vasquez to hold the baggie of cocaine right after they noticed they were being pulled over,' Breuer reported.

'While speaking to Vales, his speech was slurred as if he had been drinking.'

Police also found a bag of cannabis under the front driver seat.

Vales was charged with possession of cocaine, possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of cannabis under 20 grams. 

Vasquez was wanted in Osceola County for battery, the report said.

He was charged with possession of cocaine, possession of drug paraphernalia and tampering with evidence.

The latter charge was for throwing the baggie. 

Vales bond was set at $1,500 and Vasquez at $2,500.
