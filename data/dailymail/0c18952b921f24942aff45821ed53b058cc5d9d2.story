Millions of British households will have to retune their TV sets following plans to sell off broadcasting frequencies used by Freeview (file picture)

Millions of households will have to retune their TV sets and up to 300,000 will need to move their aerial or install a new one following a decision to sell off the broadcasting frequencies used by Freeview.

Regulator Ofcom yesterday announced the decision, which will create space on the nation’s airwaves to expand high-speed mobile phone services.

It is predicted the move will cost viewers up to £16million and affect up to 20million homes.

The retuning will start in 2019 – possibly earlier.

Meanwhile the companies that run the network of masts could face a bill of £470million to install equipment needed to cope with the change. This could be at least partly funded through the BBC TV licence fee.

The radical overhaul has been challenged by a company called Digital UK. The firm, which is owned by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Arqiva – who own and operate the transmitter network – warned that the move will be expensive and disruptive for viewers.

The decision by Ofcom will allow the Government to sell the highly lucrative 700 megahertz transmission band to mobile phone networks offering high speed 4G services, potentially raising billions of pounds for the Treasury.

Announcing the proposals, Ofcom said they will greatly improve signals used by mobile phones and boost the economy. It added: ‘Demand for mobile data could be 45 times higher by 2030 than it is today.’

Ofcom chief executive Ed Richards said: ‘This is a crucial next step in the development of the UK’s communications infrastructure.

‘More spectrum will be available for mobile broadband where demand is especially high, but the UK will retain a competitive terrestrial television platform as well.’ 

But the impact on viewers, digital terrestrial television (DTT) and the Freeview channels broadcast through masts and aerials was buried in the detail of the report.

This states: ‘We estimate that 14million to 20million households will need to retune. For the vast majority of viewers the proposed replan will only involve a simple retuning of their TVs or set-top boxes. For up to 0.5 per cent of households using DTT, it will also involve replacing their rooftop aerial.’

Ofcom estimates up to 190,000 will need to move their aerial, while another 110,000 will need to buy a new one, at an average cost of £150 a time. The regulator estimates the overall cost to consumers will be £10million to £16million.

Digital UK said: ‘Neither broadcasters nor viewers should bear the cost of any transition and terrestrial television must be assured continued access to alternative airwaves for the long term.’

Telecoms expert Dominic Baliszewski, of broadbandchoices.co.uk, said the changes are good news for mobile users, particularly in rural areas.

He said: ‘The decision to free up more frequencies for mobile broadband is a bit like opening a new lane on a busy motorway for certain types of traffic – this will mean more capacity and better speeds.

‘The 700Mhz band is better at passing through walls and can travel further than other frequencies. The means that people in rural areas, or other areas with historically poor coverage, might stand to benefit the most.’
