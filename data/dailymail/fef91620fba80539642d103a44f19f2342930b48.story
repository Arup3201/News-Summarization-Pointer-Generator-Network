School days are often said to be the happiest of your life.

But for Tom Parker Bowles, being packed off to board at the age of seven is not an experience he wishes to repeat for his own children.

The Duchess of Cornwall’s son yesterday claimed his prep school was ‘a hotbed of the sorts of things that are coming out now’, and reportedly revealed that one master would join naked boys in the shower.

Tom Parker Bowles' former headmaster has dismissed as 'complete rubbish' the food writer's claims his old primary school was a hotbed of impropriety

In a candid interview, he said of Summer Fields school in Oxford: ‘It was just certain things that weren’t right and I’d say to my dad and he’d say, “Well, you tell me if anything happens”, and it never did. So perhaps I’m speaking totally out of turn.’

It is understood the unnamed master was not himself naked in the shower.

But the anecdote is bound to raise questions about what is acceptable for a teacher acting ‘in loco parentis’.

The food writer and Mail on Sunday restaurant critic, 39, was a pupil at the school – motto ‘mens sana in corpore sano’ or ‘a healthy mind in a healthy body’ – in the early 1980s before going to Eton.

Last night Nigel Talbot Rice, 76, who was headmaster of Summer Fields when Mr Parker Bowles was there, before retiring from the post in 1997, dismissed any suggestion of impropriety, and said no official complaints were received.

Asked about Mr Parker Bowles’s comments, Mr Talbot Rice added: ‘It is complete rubbish. He was a very happy little boy.’ 

The school, where boarding fees are currently £25,953 a year, is one of the main feeder schools for Eton.

After being contacted yesterday by the Mail about Mr Parker Bowles’s comments in The Times, a Summer Fields spokesman said: ‘There is no one available to talk about it and the school does not wish to comment.’

Mr Parker Bowles and his wife Sara Buys, a fashion editor at Harper’s Bazaar, send their children Lola, seven, and Freddy, four, to London day schools.

He told how his mother Camilla regretted sending him away to board so young. After Lola’s seventh birthday earlier this month, he said to his mother: ‘You sent me away eight months after this.’

He continued: ‘My mother was slightly appalled, saying she’d never do it again, but it was the thing you did, you know.’

In the wide-ranging interview to promote his new cookbook, Let’s Eat Meat, Mr Parker Bowles also spoke of his reaction to his mother’s long affair with Prince Charles, and her divorce from his father Andrew Parker Bowles, who was Commanding Officer of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment.

Tom on: Charles and the ‘Camillagate’ tape

Prince Charles had a highly intimate late-night mobile phone conversation with Camilla in 1989. A transcript of the ‘Camillagate’ call was made public in 1992, weeks after news had broken about the ‘Squidgygate’ tapes involving Diana and her lover James Gilbey.

It caused huge embarrassment to the Royal Family because it included details of how the prince had told his lover that he wanted to be her ‘tampon’.

Tom Parker Bowles has revealed how he did not want to look at newspapers when transcripts of the 'Camillagate' call, involving his mother and Prince Charles (pictured above), were made public 

Yesterday Mr Parker Bowles said: ‘I sort of remember not looking at the paper because you know, Jesus, the things that we’ve all said to people that we love or girlfriends or boyfriends that you wouldn’t want the world reading!

‘I just felt pissed off. I wasn’t going to read that sort of stuff about my mother, just as much as she wouldn’t want to read it about me, or my kids certainly wouldn’t want to read it about me. I don’t think I’ve ever listened to it.’

Tom on: His Parents' doomed marriage

Asked if he felt his parents got on while he was growing up, Mr Parker Bowles said: ‘Perfectly well. I mean, I think as a boy when you’re away a lot you see less, but always.’ He added: ‘They divorced when I was 18. I think you had a sort of inkling perhaps but I always felt that it was just a normal way of things happening.

‘God knows my mother has been called every name under the sun. I suppose we have as well. We’ve never really cared.

‘My mum’s got an iPad now and I was like, “Don’t read the below-the-line stuff,” and, of course she’s [saying], “You’re not going to believe what they just said here! Check this out.”

Tom on: Being caught in tabloid drug sting

Mr Parker Bowles was caught bragging about taking cocaine by the now closed News Of The World at the Cannes Film Festival in 1999 when he was a junior ‘fixer’ in showbusiness publicity circles. But yesterday he said he bears no grudge.

Mr Parker Bowles yesterday described his mother Camilla, called ‘Gaga’ by his children, as ‘a brilliant grandmother’

He told The Times: ‘That was entirely my fault. I wasn’t moaning and groaning about an intrusion of privacy. You know the position you’re in and if you muck up you pay the consequences and that was the end of that.’

Mr Parker Bowles said the incident stopped him using the Class A drug. He added: ‘If a few toffs get caught taking coke and that’s the price you pay for Press freedom, well bring it on. I cannot tell you how strongly I believe that one of the cornerstones of democracy is a free Press.’

Tom on: Smoking, only thing I did well at Eton

Despite his reservations about boarding at prep school, Mr Parker Bowles enjoyed his time at Eton and intends to send his son there when he is 13. But yesterday he claimed he didn’t work very hard at the top school until his father threatened to send him to a comprehensive.

He said: ‘My mother couldn’t care. When I had bad reports, she’d be by the window making faces behind my father going, “You’re going to comprehensive if this happens again”, and he meant it. “I’m not going to spend all this money on you if you’re not going to pull your f***ing finger out.”

‘He drove me past Corsham comprehensive [in Wiltshire] and I remember thinking how many pretty girls there were but also tough-looking boys – not like the sort of boys at Eton.

‘And so, third year, GCSEs, that’s when I bucked up and did some work.’ But he added: ‘I was rubbish at everything. I was good at smoking.

‘We knew a couple of pubs where you could drink underage, but apart from a couple of English prizes I moved like a ghost through that school.’

Tom on: The brilliant granny we call ‘Gaga’

Mr Parker Bowles yesterday described his mother Camilla, called ‘Gaga’ by his children, as ‘a brilliant grandmother’.

‘I mean, she works incredibly hard. She’d be the first to say that she didn’t really have a job apart from being our mother, which she was very good at, and suddenly age 55 she is working,’ he said. ‘She’s worked incredibly hard, really, really, really hard.’

Asked if she would be queen one day, he said: ‘I have no idea. That is one for far greater minds and constitutionalists than me.’

The self-confessed monarchist doesn’t feel royal himself. ‘Christ, no! I’m a good old pleb,’ he said.
