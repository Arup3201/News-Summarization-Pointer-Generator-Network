She's quickly risen from star of controversial documentary Benefits Street to the queen of the Celebrity Big Brother house - and the future seems to be looking bright for White Dee.

The self-confessed mother of James Turner Street in Birmingham - Britain's most benefit-dependent street - is apparently set to earn hundreds of thousands of pounds when she leaves the Channel 5 show.

So successful is White Dee  set to be that rumours of her designing a clothing line for Asos went into overdrive today.

Get the look? Celebrity Big Brother star White Dee's agent claimed that she's in talks with Asos to design a plus-size clothing line - something that the e-tailer has flatly denied

Her agent told The Sun: 'We have held discussions with online retailer Asos about Dee doing a plus size line. We are talking to other designers too.'

Popular fashion e-tailer Asos does, however, flatly deny these rumours. 

A spokesperson for Asos told MailOnline: 'We can’t provide comment as it is not true.'

While Asos have denied any involvement with the mother-of-two, it's not all bad for the 43-year-old, whose real name is Deirdre Kelly.

Her agent claims that she has as many as 15 offers already lined up including a documentary and a cookery show.

Barry Tomes claims that she's already turned down £60,000 fly-on-the-wall show for Channel 4, instead choosing to star on CBB for £100,000.

The Benefits Street's star is enjoying her time on CBB and has succeeded in her mission to convince three overseas housemates that she is British royalty.

On entering the Big Brother house Dee was set the task of trying to persuade the trio - serial US reality show starlet Angelique 'Frenchy' Morgan and actors Gary Busey and Leslie Jordan - that she is Duchess of Solihull.

Unknown to the overseas celebrities, the British housemates knew her real identity and helped with the cover-up.

Big Brother announced to cheers and laughter among the housemates, that since Dee had been convincing the whole house would be rewarded with a 'right royal knees up'.

Earlier viewers had seen Dee tell a few fake royal tales to the overseas housemates.
