They are the generation who are likely to spend a large part of their lives sitting front of a screen.

While many claim this can damage interpersonal skills, a new study claims that children under two can learn to communicate just as well from videos as they can from their parents.

The US study claims to be the first to isolate the effects of what are described as 'educational commercial videos' on infant learning.

Emory University in Atlanta found that babies were consistently able to understand signs and pick out a photo of the object after watching a video for 15 minutes.

The video was shown four times a week for three weeks. 

Babies who watched the video performed just as well in tests as babies who had been taught signs by their parents under similar conditions.

Importantly, after a week without instruction, babies in all groups were still able to produce the signs 0 a much more difficult task than simply recognising them.

However, babies in parent-supported groups were able to produce a greater number of signs overall. 

'This is the first controlled study to show that babies as young as 15 months can learn communicative skills from commercial videos just as well as from parents,' says Shoshana Dayanim, a lead researcher.

'They could recognise a novel photo of an object and label it using signs that they had only been exposed to from the video.' 

The researchers caution that the results should not be seen as an endorsement of video watching for children under two, which has been recommended against by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

'We can't speak to the short-term or long-term cognitive effects of video exposure for infants overall -- only the potential for instruction,' Professor Namy says. 

'There are many caveats to our research: the nature of the learning material matters and a lot may depend on the learning context and the formal features of the video.'

The research does, however, demonstrate that video can be an effective teaching tool for children under the right circumstances.

'The key takeaway is that babies can learn from commercial videos - at least signs,' Professor Dayanim says. 

'The majority of parents continue to expose their babies to video. It will be important to determine the conditions under which videos do and do not support infant learning.'

Video-based therapy for families with babies at risk of autism improves infants' engagement, attention and social behaviour. It  might also reduce their risk chances of developing the condition,according to a new study. 

Researchers showed that using video feedback-based therapy to help parents understand and respond to their baby's early communication style might help modify emerging autism symptoms.

'Targeting the earliest risk markers of autism, such as lack of attention or reduced social interest or engagement, during the first year of life may lessen the development of these symptoms later,' said Jonathan Green, a Manchester University professor of child and adolescent psychiatry. 

In this study, a specially adapted Video Interaction for Promoting Positive Parenting Programme (iBASIS-VIPP) was delivered to babies aged seven to 10 months who had a higher risk of autism because they had an autistic older sibling.

After five months, families who received video therapy showed improvements in infant engagement, attention and social behaviour, suggesting the therapy may be able to modify the emergence of autism-related symptoms, the researchers said.
