A hardline Muslim group has defended jihadists in the Middle East against what they claim is a 'fear mongering campaign' from the Federal Government after two Australian militants appeared in a recruitment video last week.

Hizb ut-Tahrir Australia says the insurgent group ISIS is being unfairly portrayed as evil in 'fantastical Hollywood style', after Prime Minister Tony Abbott condemned the chilling video that called for Australians to join the fight in Syria and Iraq.

Uthman Badar, spokesman for Hizb ut-Tahrir, was set to speak at the Sydney Opera House in August about whether honour killings could be morally justified before it was canceled late on Tuesday due to public outrage.

Uthman Badar defended a cancelled speech he was due to give on the topic of honour killings at the Opera House in August, saying the organisers insisted he talk about them

'ISIS is being portrayed, in fantastical Hollywood style, as evil incarnate on Earth, having seemingly taken over from al-Qaeda who previously fulfilled this bogeyman role,' the group said in a statement on its website on Tuesday.

'Muslims in the west who make the sacrifice of going abroad to fight tyranny and assist the oppressed are characteristed as 'extremists' and 'terrorists'.'

More than 100 Australians are believed to be fighting with Middle East extremist groups like ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria), prompting Mr Abbott to warn the Government will crackdown on home-grown terrorists.

The comments come after a chilling video was released by insurgent group, Islamic state of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), issuing a plea for Australians to join them in their fight in Syria and Iraq

'The Government that stopped the boats will stop the jihadists,' he said.

Mr Abbott said that while there would be no new invasion of Iraq to quell the violence in that country's north, Australia would redouble its efforts to protect its national security.

But the Prime Minister was named by Hizb ut-Tahrir as the person 'leading the way in demonising Islam and Muslims'.

'Yesterday he was attacking and threatening Muslims who go to fight abroad whilst at the same time congratulating the secular dictatorial regime of al-Sisi,' they said.

'We remind the Prime Ministerâ€¦ that Australia has no business interfering in the Muslim world.

'We remind him that Australia made the mistake of going into Iraq aforetime, and that if he does so again, his Government and those who support such a move alone will be responsible for the repercussions that ensue.'

The 13-minute ISIS recruitment video titled There Is No Life Without Jihad showed five extremists, including this Australian on the left, urging people to 'respond to Allah' and 'wake up and be part of the effort'

But Mr Abbott told a Coalition joint party room meeting in Canberra on Tuesday that it was not an issue of religion but rather about extremism, illegality and violence.

'We should never do anything to sully our reputation as a beacon of hope and freedom for people from across the world,' Mr Abbott said.

'We will not let our country down in rising to this latest national security challenge.'

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on Tuesday vowed to continue canceling the passports of Australians suspected of being a threat to national security, including those thinking of going abroad to fight.

Ms Bishop said the Middle East conflict was attracting a 'disturbingly large' number of foreign fighters, and the risk posed by those returning to Australia could not be understated.

'The Syrian-Iraq conflict is now a growing threat to global security and is one of the most serious challenges to Australia's domestic security for some time,' she told Parliament.

Ms Bishop said the government was keeping a close on eye on extremists and those it suspected of fundraising or recruiting for these groups.

The 13-minute ISIS recruitment video titled There Is No Life Without Jihad showed five extremists, including two Australians, urging people to 'respond to Allah' and 'wake up and be part of the effort'.

Fighting for terrorist groups outlawed by Australian law such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant carries jail penalties of up to 25 years.

Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman Mr Badar, said 'hysteria' won out after the Sydney Opera House back flipped on plans for a public talk on honour killings during its Festival of Dangerous Ideas on August 30.

Its inclusion in the line-up sparked a barrage of criticism on social media and condemnation from the NSW government, with Minister for Women Pru Goward branding it 'abhorrent'.

Late on Tuesday, the Opera House announced on its Facebook page that the lecture would not go ahead.

'The Festival of Dangerous Ideas is intended to be a provocation to thought and discussion, rather than simply a provocation,' the statement said.

'It is always a matter of balance and judgement, and in this case a line has been crossed... It is clear from the public reaction that the title has given the wrong impression of what Mr Badar intended to discuss.'

Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman Mr Badar, said 'hysteria' won out after the Sydney Opera House back flipped on plans for a public talk on honour killings during its Festival of Dangerous Ideas on August 30

'Neither Mr Badar, (festival organisers) the St James Ethics Centre, nor Sydney Opera House in any way advocates honour killings or condones any form of violence against women.'

Mr Badar took to Twitter to make a statement of his own.

'Hysteria wins out. Opera house cancels my session at #FODI. Welcome to the free world, where freedom of expression is a cherished value,' he wrote.

'Time for name change: Festival of relatively dangerous ideas.'

Mr Badar had indicated he did not intend to defend honour killings.
