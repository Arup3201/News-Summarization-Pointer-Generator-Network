It is usually teeming with surfers but Australia's iconic Bondi Beach could now easily be mistaken for a lake as warm weather and a lack of wind drives the waves away.

The famous Sydney beach was overrun by boats on Sunday as people took advantage of the remarkably flat water during a 10km swimming race from Bondi to Watsons Bay.

Forecasters say the surf may not return for several days as the entire NSW coast experiences similar conditions.

Australia's iconic Bondi Beach was overrun by boats on Sunday as waves along the popular surfing hot spot were remarkably absent

'The lack of waves relates to the same reason we've had the really stable and clear weather for the past week,' Simon Louis, a Bureau of Meterology forecaster said.

'There's a real high pressure system that's sitting over the Tasman and extending over NSW.'

Mr Louis said the warm weather meant there was no low pressure systems around to build up some swell and was affecting areas as far as Byron Bay on the north coast of NSW.

'Byron looks like it's slightly higher (than Bondi) but even that's not high,' he said.

'There's very light winds on the coast at the moment so there's no wind waves being generated closer to the beach,' Mr Louis said.

'It's probably fairly common when there's very stable weather.

'But it would vary during different parts of the day – in the afternoon there's more likely to be a sea breeze.'

The waves are expected to pick back up later this week.

'We're expecting a bit of a change on Wednesday with a southerly wind and a bit of a temperature drop,' Mr Louis said.

'It looks like there’s a chance it may break down.'

The calm Bondi waters continued this morning and lifeguards from Bondi North Lifesaving Club managed to capture a whale frolicking close to the beach.

The sighting is one of many in recent days with two humpbacks playing with a pod of dolphins off Bondi Beach on Saturday morning.

Another five were seen around the same area that afternoon.

Jonas Liebschner from Whale Watching Sydney said the large number of animals sighted was extraordinary.

'(It) is a phenomenal number for this early in the season,' he told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Bondi is normally home to big waves and the clear absence corresponds with the warm weather Sydney has experienced in the past week
