Lewis Hamilton and Nicole Scherzinger celebrated their sixth anniversary together by visiting one of the most romantic cities on earth.

The Mercedes driver took the former Pussycat Doll on a trip to Venice, before flying to New York.

He tweeted photos of their visit to both cities after returning home to Monaco from the Austrian Grand Prix.

The compilation of Venice photos were accompanied with the caption: 'Better late than never. @nicolescherzy & I in Venice for our 6th Anniversary. #goodtimes #godisthegreatest.'

Hamilton then added more photos and tweeted: 'Then The Hamptons New York. Always wanted to go after watching "White Chicks"! We had an amazing time. @nicolescherzy.'

The 2008 F1 World Champion is currently second to team-mate Nico Rosberg in this year's drivers' standings after again finishing behind the German at the Austrian Grand Prix.

Rosberg won the race at the Red Bull Ring, with Hamilton fighting all the way to the end but unable to overtake him.

Hamilton has 136 points to Rosberg's 165 and will look to claw some back when they next race at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone.
