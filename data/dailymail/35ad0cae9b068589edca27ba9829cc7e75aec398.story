Two girls have been arrested in connection with the 
death of a 12-year-old girl who committed suicide after 
being bullied online for almost a year.

Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd identified the girls as Katelyn Roman, 12, and Guadalupe Shaw, 14, during a news conference today in Winter Haven, Florida, and revealed details of a heartless Facebook post written by Shaw on Saturday.

'Yes IK [I know] I bullied REBECCA nd [sic] she killed her self but IDGAF [I don't give a f***],' Shaw allegedly posted.

Rebecca was 'terrorized' by 
as many as 15 girls who ganged up on her and picked on her for months 
through online message boards and texts. She jumped to her death from a tower at an abandoned concrete plant on September 10.

Judd said they decided to arrest Shaw after she posted the message on Saturday.

'We decided that we can't leave her out there. Who else is she going to torment, who else is she going to harass?' he said.

Roman was Rebecca's former best friend, but Judd said the
 14-year-old turned her against Rebecca. Other girls also stopped 
being friends with her in fear of being bullied, the sheriff said.

'Several students corroborated stories of both girls bullying Sedwick on 
different occasions, through name-calling, intimidation, threats to beat
 her up, and at least one actual physical fight,' the sheriff said today.

He warned parents in a news conference today: 'Watch what your children do online. Pay attention to what your kids are doing. Quit being their best friend and be their best parent.'

Roman and Shaw were 
arrested on Monday night and detained at the county's juvenile center 
before being released to their parents, the Orlando Sentinel reports.

They were charged with felony aggravated stalking.

Several media outlets have released the names and mugshots of the young girls after law enforcement officials identified them at a press conference today.

It is believed the bullying started when Shaw started dating Rebecca's ex-boyfriend.

Witnesses told investigators she sent messages to Rebecca, calling her ugly, telling her to 'drink bleach and die', and encouraging her to kill herself.

The 12-year-old was jumped in school and repeatedly hounded in online messages or texts telling her to kill herself and that she was ugly.

Her computer searches revealed she had searched for ways to commit suicide and asked questions like, 'What is overweight for a 13-year-old girl' .

One of the Florida girl's screensavers also showed Rebecca with her head resting on a railroad track.

She changed one of her online screen names to 'That Dead Girl.' She messaged a boy: 'I'm jumping.'

Polk County Sheriff Judd said Rebecca had been 'absolutely terrorized' by the other girls.

'We can see from what we've been investigating so far that Rebecca wasn't attacking back,' Judd said.

'She
 appeared to be beat down. She appeared to have a defeatist attitude. 
And quite frankly, the entire investigation is exceptionally 
disturbing.'

Even when her mother took Rebecca out of school, the bullying was carried out online.

The bullying started 
over a boy last year at Crystal Lake Middle School and at one point she 
was suspended for fighting with another student - believed to be Roman.

Last December, 
Rebecca was hospitalized for three days after cutting her wrists because
 of what she said was bullying, according to the sheriff.

'When
 she was being bullied at Crystal Lake Middle, she used to come home 
every day and tell me how she wasn’t worth anything, that she was ugly, 
how she was stupid,' her mother Tricia Norman said after her death.

'And
 I said, ''Baby what on earth would make you think that? You’re the most
 beautiful person I know and the smartest person I know.'''

Later, after Rebecca 
complained that she had been pushed in the hallway and that another girl
 wanted to fight her, Rebecca's mother began home-schooling her, Judd 
said.

This fall, Rebecca 
started at a new school, Lawton Chiles Middle Academy, and loved it, 
Judd said. But the bullying continued online.

'She put on a perfect, happy face. She never told me,' Tricia Norman told the Lakeland Ledger.

'I never had a clue. I mean, she told me last year when she was being bullied, but not this year, and I have no idea why.'

Once
 police checked her cell phone they discovered that the bullying had not
 stopped, especially on Kik Messenger, Instagram and Ask.fm.

'They would tell her she's ugly, stupid, nobody liked her go kill herself," Ms Norman said.

She has started a Facebook page to try to fight back against online bullies, called Rebecca Sedwick Against Bullying.

Ms Norman told 10 News she was inspired to start it after reading her daughter's journal.

In
 it, Rebecca had written: 'Every day more and more kids kill themselves 
because of bullying. How many lives have to be lost until people realize
 words do matter?'

Ms Norman
 wants online bullies to face harsher consequences, and begged other 
young victims to stay strong and seek help, adding: 'Don't ever give up,
 like Becca did.'
