Office workers who spend all day behind their desks should consider working standing up instead, according to new research.

Staying on your feet for an extra three hours a day would burn off 8lbs (3.6kg) of fat each year, according to exercise scientist John Buckley from Chester University.

He said there is no need to sit down so much and those feeling sluggish would do well to push their chairs away during the day.

On your feet: Humans are designed to stand up and keep moving, says Dr Buckley

Dr Buckley added that people could switch to higher than normal computer desks to answer emails and type documents.

An upright working stance was championed by author Ernest Hemingway who wrote his vigorous prose on a typewriter at a special chest-height desk.

In a letter in 1950, Hemingway wrote: 'Writing and travel broaden your ass if not your mind and I like to write standing up.'

Dr Buckley, from the department of clinical sciences and nutrition at Chester University, said that switching from chairs to working standing up will reduce obesity and improve circulation.

Standing up for three hours will consume 144 calories, he claims.

'People are sitting down at work, then sitting in the car and then sitting down in front of the television,' Dr Buckley told BBC News.

'Your metabolic rate crashes to an absolute minimum. It isn't natural. Humans are designed to stand up and keep moving.'

Dr Buckley is part of a group of experts working with England's chief medical officer on ways to tackle obesity.

There have been several recent reports warning about the sedentary nature of work and recreation.

A study late last year made a strong connection between too much sitting down and an increased risk of diabetes.

Meanwhile a major Australian study published in March 2012 found 
sitting down too long increases your risk of dying within a few years - 
even if you are already physically active.

It found adults who sat 11 or more hours 
per day had a 40 per cent increased risk of dying in the next three 
years compared with those whosat for fewer than four hours a day.

Dr Buckley concluded making small changes in the workplace such as standing at your disk can make long-term improvements to your health.
