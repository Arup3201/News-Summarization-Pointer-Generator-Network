The Duchess of Cornwall has made her second public appearance in as many days to unveil a new portrait of herself at the Helen & Douglas House Hospice in Oxfordshire.

Less than a week after she was seen wiping away tears at the funeral of her brother Mark Shand, the Duchess, 66, summoned up a smile as she spoke with the terminally ill children being cared for on the premises.

She is the official patron of the hospice, and artist Ruth Heppel was commissioned to paint the portrait which marks Helen & Douglas House' 10th anniversary.

Does it look like me? The Duchess of Cornwall smiles as she inspects her new Ruth Heppel portrait

Important: The portrait was commissioned to mark the 10th anniversary of an Oxfordshire hospice

Although 
signs of strain could still be seen on the Duchess' face, Camilla, who 
spent yesterday touring RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire, appeared 
delighted with the work.

Elegant
 in a cream skirt suit with a collarless jacket and a neat pair of black
 court shoes, she spoke warmly with staff before touring the wards.

Yesterday, the Duchess beamed as she was greeted outside the base by cheering children waving Union flags outside RAF Leeming.

During
 her visit, which was arranged to mark the opening of a new medical 
centre, the Duchess met wounded personnel, among them Corporal Paul 
Bentley-Crane, who showed the royal how some of the state-of-the-art 
equipment is used.

Mr Shand, the Duchess of Cornwall's younger brother, died in a freak accident in New York last month.

The
 62-year-old conservationist and travel writer had been hosting a 
charity auction on behalf of  Elephant Family at Sotheby's but slipped 
and struck his head on the pavement as he tried to re-enter the Rose Bar
 at the Gramercy Park Hotel through a revolving door after going for a 
drink with a relative.

His funeral, which was attended by 180 mourners, including the Prince of Wales and MP Zac Goldsmith, took place at the Holy Trinity Church in Stourpaine, Dorset last Thursday.

During the service, Camilla was comforted by her husband Prince Charles who wrapped a protective arm around her as they walked into church.

Since his death, donations to Elephant Family, an NGO that campaigns on behalf of the endangered Asian elephant, have soared, while tributes flooded in from friends and family members.

One of the most touching came from Camilla's son, Tom Parker-Bowles, who described Mr Shand, simply, as 'the greatest uncle a boy could have'.

Brave face: Camilla looked tired but made time to stop and chat with children waiting outside the airfield

Support: Camilla was supported by Prince Charles during the service in memory of her brother Mark Shand

Family: The Duchess of Cornwall was accompanied by her son Tom Parker-Bowles at the service last week
