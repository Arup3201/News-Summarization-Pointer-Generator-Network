'I had ribs for lunch, that’s why I’m doing this,' he tells his co-anchors.

Later, while he's reading the sports news, he says, 'please tell me this is some kind of sick and tasteless joke.'

Another comment goes: 'Ladies and gentlemen, can I please have your attention, I have just been handed an urgent and horrifying news story, I need all of you to stop what you’re doing and listen.'
