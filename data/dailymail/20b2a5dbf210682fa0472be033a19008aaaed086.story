West Ham assistant manager Neil McDonald is adamant the club have rightly ruled Diafra Sakho cannot play in the Africa Nations Cup, insisting the striker's back injury is genuine.

Senegal Football Federation president Augustin Senghor accused the club of a 'lack of respect' over Sakho's withdrawal and said he would consult FIFA and the Football Association in a bid to prevent the player from appearing for West Ham during the tournament.

West Ham have since sent Senegal independent medical reports, as well as the club's own examinations, to prove the extent of the injury.

Diafra Sakho will miss the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal with a back injury sustained against West Brom

West Ham star Sakho was due to report for international duty but is struggling with his back problem

West Ham assistant manager Neil McDonald said the club have sent medical reports to the Senegal FA

'We've been in constant contact with the Senegal federation,' said McDonald.

'There's no way he can fly, he's obviously injured and he's going to miss the Africa Nations Cup because of his injury and we're going to miss him because he's injured.

'We've been respectful, we've given them information and kept in constant contact with them. He's injured.

'We've asked them to come across and assess him. We've had independent scans done and scans from the club.

'We're not trying to stop anyone from going to represent their country.'
