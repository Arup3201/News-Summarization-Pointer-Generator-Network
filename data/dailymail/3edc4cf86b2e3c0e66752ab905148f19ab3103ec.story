An ex-marathon runner who piled on the pounds after getting married, going from a size 10 to a size 20, has finally beaten her demons by losing five stone.

Nicola Meehan, 28, from Wilmslow, Cheshire, was fit and active, working out regularly and even competing in the London marathon.

But after marrying her husband, Michael, 32, the newlywed began regularly eat takeaways and chocolate, going up to a size 20 and weighing in at 15st.

After being shocked by the number on the scales, Nicola finally decided to do something about her size. 

She joined Weight Watchers and now weighs 10st 1lb.

Nicola, a mother-of-two, said: 'When I was younger I was always very active and I exercised a lot.

'Then when I was training for the marathon I was constantly running and burning off the calories.

'But the marathon was such hard work - it put me off running for life.

'I made sure I was slim for my wedding, but after that I just wasn't as bothered.

'I knew I was putting on weight, but I was very happy so it didn't really get me down.

'It wasn't until my friend asked me if I wanted to join Weight Watchers with her that I realised I was too big.

'Luckily, I found it really easy and lost weight really quickly.

After getting married to her husband Michael Meehan, Nicola started to snack regularly on takeaways and chocolate 

'Now I'm even too skinny for my wedding dress.'

Nicola had always been slim, but it was when she became settled into married life that she began to put on weight.

Nicola said: 'After I got married my life consisted of working and eating.

'I always said I was going to start a diet, but I'd have a mars bar and then say I'd start tomorrow.

'I did know I was putting on weight but I wasn't depressed.

'My husband was very active but he never brought it up.

'It was just really gradual, and then I became pregnant - I thought it was marvelous that I could eat for two.

After having two children, Nicola struggled to lose the weight and ended up wearing her maternity clothes long after giving birth 

'Looking back at pictures now, I look horrendous, but at the time I'd look in the mirror and think I looked good.'

Despite Nicola's confidence, she slowly began to realise she was piling on the pounds.

She said: 'I remember once I had a pair of size 16 maternity trousers and they wouldn't fit.

'I had to ask my sister to swap them for a size 20, but the shop didn't stock them.

'I stayed wearing my maternity clothes even when I wasn't pregnant - they were the only clothes that fit me.

'I couldn't go down the slide or on the swings with my daughter.

'Even my wedding rings were too tight, they were well and truly stuck on my fingers.'

It was only when Nicola's best friend suggested they join Weight Watchers together, that Nicola finally started to change her ways.

After joining WeightWatchers, Nicola quickly lost weight and is now the slimmest she has ever been 

Nicola said: 'Someone I know at a baby group has asked me if I wanted to join a slimming club, and at the time I was a little insulted.

'But then my best friend, who was in a similar position to me, asked me if I wanted to go to Weight Watchers with her and I just thought I might as well.

'Before I went to my first meeting I decided to weigh myself - I hadn't for ages and wanted to know what I was letting myself in for.

'When I saw that I was 15 stone I just couldn't believe it.

'I used to run marathons - I didn't realise I'd got that big.

'It was a shock.'

Luckily, Nicola found Weight Watchers easy, and the weight quickly melted off. 

Breakfast: Two pieces of toast

Snack: Mars bar

Lunch: Salad with cheese and lots of mayonnaise

Snack: Chocolate bar

Dinner: Chinese takeaway

Breakfast: Banana and porridge

Lunch: Two crumpets with half a tin of beans, fruit and yoghurt

Dinner: Salmon, baked potato, and salad

Snack: Curly Wurly and a digestive biscuit

 

She said: 'I got to my goal weight of 11st 1lbs pretty quickly, but I decided I wanted to lose more than that so I lost a bit more.

'There wasn't a day that went by that I wasn't motivated to lose the weight.

'It was great because I didn't feel like I was on a diet, it was a lifestyle change.'

Now, Nicola weighs in at a healthy 10st 1lb, and is happier than ever.

She said: 'I wish I joined Weight Watchers years ago.

'I just feel really happy and healthy.

'I'm even hoping to become a weight watchers leader one day - I want people to enjoy losing weight as much as I did. It has  changed my life.'
