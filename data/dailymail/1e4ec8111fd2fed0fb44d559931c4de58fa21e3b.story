A Brisbane man is living the life of the future after having a microchip implanted under his skin so he can control electronic devices with just a wave of a hand.

Ben Slater had a radio-frequency identification microchip - which has similar measurements to a grain of rice - injected into his left hand through a syringe two weeks ago at a Melbourne tattoo parlour.

The advertising director's move comes as technology enthusiasts eagerly await the unveiling of the iPhone 6 in two days time.

Ben Slater has had a microchip inserted into his hand to allow him to open doors and switch on lights with the wave of his hand

Mr Slater said he did it because he had always been fascinated with the future of technology

He hopes the new generation of Apple's smart phone will have the capability to read the microchip implanted in the webbing between his thumb and forefinger.

The new addition to his body means Mr Slater can swing his front door open, switch on his lights and store personal information with the flick of his hand.

'The most obvious thing the chip allows me to do is store my contact information on it, so that I can just touch a phone with NFC and pass my information to their phone. That is a great party trick,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'But it can also trigger an action on my phone to turn the house lights off, open a secure door which is set to recognise the chip or I could - and probably will - set up my car ignition to be linked to the chip for keyless entry and start up.'

Mr Slater told Daily Mail Australia he made the decision to implant the microchip because he had always been interested in the future of technology.

'I wanted to get the chip implanted to generate discussion,' he said.

'It intrigues me that we live in an age where this type of activity is even possible, especially for some seeming random guy in Australia to arrange to have done.'

It was inserted in a Melbourne tattoo parlour with a syringe containing the chip

Mr Slater said the procedure to implant the microchip was painful, but over quickly.

'I just needed to be really careful when it was healing over the course of the two weeks later so that I didn't move it - otherwise it could have travelled in my hand,' he said.

The microchip implant may still be new to Australian shores, but it has become a growing trend in the United States after it was introduced in 2004 when the nation's Food and Drug Administration gave the green light for its use to carry information about people's medical conditions, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.

The iPhone 6 is expected to be the largest phone Apple has produced, with a 5.5-inch screen.

It is believed the handset is so large that it will come with a special 'one-handed' mode to make it easier for people to use it.

Anticipation over the phone is so high that people in the U.S. started lining up outside Apple stores two weeks ago to be one of the first to get a slice of the action.

In the U.S., the chip is used to store the medical information of people with illness

Mr Slater hopes the new generation iPhone 6 - which will be launched on September 6 - will have the capability to read the chip
