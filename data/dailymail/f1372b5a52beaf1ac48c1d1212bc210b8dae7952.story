As an avid rugby fan, Prince William is well acquainted with the sport’s often bawdy humour.

And when he was presented yesterday with a charity calendar, featuring women players in a variety of nude poses, he declared enthusiastically: ‘Very good shots… I can recommend this!’ 

So perhaps it was lucky for him that the Duchess of Cambridge was out of earshot at the time.

After flicking through the calendar  - which features women rugby players in a variety of nude poses - William declared enthusiastically: ‘Very good shots… I can recommend this!’

The couple had just finished watching the Wales versus Australia rugby union game at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.

Kate, who is 16 weeks pregnant with their second child, had left the stadium, leaving William to attend a tea with former players, organised by the Welsh Rugby Charitable Trust, of which he is Patron.

The calendar, featuring the ladies of Gwernyfed RFC, was presented to him by former ladies player Fran Bateman. 

William studied the front cover with a dutifully pensive expression.

In August, the girls have a kit check. When William delved inside the front cover he roared with laughter – and held up one image to show another guest at his table

Fortunately, Kate (pictured) was elsewhere during the episdoe

But when he delved inside he roared with laughter – and held up one image to show another guest at his table.

‘He thought it was outrageously funny. He was having a really good laugh,’ Fran said later.

It was William and Kate’s first visit to Wales since the announcement that they are expecting their second child.

The Duchess accompanied her husband on two official engagements but took a turn for the worse after watching the game.

The couple travelled to Wales, where they lived for three years, by car and helicopter and had had an early start.

The Duchess was not travelling with a Royal doctor, and was accompanied and looked after by her private secretary.

Earlier the Duchess, dressed in a pale blue Matthew Williamson coat, showed off a very compact baby bump when she and William toured the Pembroke Refinery in Angle.

Hundreds of well-wishers braved the rain and waved Welsh flags at the couple as they arrived.

Although the couple left 16-month old Prince George at home they were given a plastic model of a fuel tanker, complete with the number plate ‘4 GEORGE’ by workers.

Will Prince pay penalty for revelling in rugby strip-tease? Let's hope she forgives him in time for Manhattan tour  

Three years after their first transatlantic visit, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are returning to the US.

The Mail on Sunday can reveal that William and Kate – who visited Los Angeles shortly after their wedding in 2011 – will embark on a three-day trip to New York next month to unveil their new charity, United For Wildlife. 

And it seems likely they will take 16-month-old Prince George with them. Pregnant Kate, who was forced to withdraw from a visit to Malta in September because she was suffering from acute morning sickness, has now been cleared to travel.

William and Kate – who visited Wales yesterday – will embark on a three-day trip to New York next month to unveil their new charity, United For Wildlife

She is said to be ‘very excited’ about the forthcoming trip – her first visit to the city – having been desperate to see New York since she was a young girl.

The Duke and Duchess will meet conservationists to discuss illegal poaching and will also sit down with officials from international charities, including the World Wildlife Fund. A spokesman for the charity said: ‘We will be in New York to talk about our Wildlife Crime Project, which is why the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are involved.’

The couple’s representatives from United For Wildlife have just returned from a reconnaissance trip and an announcement about the visit will be made imminently.

‘Kate has never been to New York and she is really looking forward to it now that she is over her illness,’ a source tells me.

Another source adds: ‘Kate was upset she had to cancel her tour of Malta, but now she is over her morning sickness and really excited about America.’

Kate visited an oil refinery in Wales yesterday, her modest baby bump just visible beneath her elegant double-breasted sky-blue wool coat. She was at the Valero facility in Pembrokeshire with Prince William to mark the 50th anniversary of its opening.

She is due to make two public appearances this week – the Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium on Thursday, and a reception for her charity Place2Be.

A Palace spokesman said: ‘Any overseas visit will be announced in the usual manner in due course.’
