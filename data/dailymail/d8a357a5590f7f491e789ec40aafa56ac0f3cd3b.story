Blosom reaches Hanson's shoulder which is actually taller than Bulls star Derrick Rose.

She is so big that Blosom barely fits in the chute for the foot trimmer. 

She says she knew Blosom was special when she was a calf.

After learning the cow couldn't bear a calf, she decided to keep the tame animal as a pet instead of sending Blosom to slaughter, reports RRStar.com.

'Blosom is the pride of the farm,' Hanson said. 'I love to share her with my guests and she loves to greet them.  

'Many of my guests come from the city, and to have a cow officially greet them adds to the ambiance of the farm.

Blosom is so popular that she even has her own Facebook page.  

Hanson says she sought the record after veterinarians and the cow's foot trimmer constantly noted the 2,000lb animal's large size.

At the end of May, family and friends began documenting Blosom's mass through photos and videos. 

Her official measurements were taken by a vet from Orangeville Animal Health Service.

Hanson received an email in mid-August saying Blosom had been granted the honor.  

Blosom turned 13 in July.

Hanson said she wants to turn Blosom's story into a children's book someday. 

According to the Guinness Book of Records the shortest cow is Blaze, who measures 69.07 cm (2 ft 3.19 in) from the hoof to the withers, as verified in Sanford, Florida, on 7 July 2013.

Blaze is an eight-year-old miniature Zebu cow born on 12 September 2005 and owned by Steven DeMoor and Christian Agnew.

In 2008 a black and white Friesian bullock which weighed well over a ton and was the same height as a small elephant vied for the crown in the UK.

His owners contacted the Guinness Book of Records saying he was 6ft 6in.
