On one of the coldest days in decades, the last thing you would want to do is head out on a 29 mile walk.

However one man did exactly that and ended up walking to court to deal with a traffic citation.

Lilburn police say a Fulton County man walked from a downtown Atlanta shelter to Lilburn Municipal Court.

Long walk to freedom: James walked 29 miles in subzero temperatures for his court appearance

The man told Lilburn Police Officer Andy Blimline that he received a ticket for a crash, but his car was totaled, so he began his journey to court at 1 a.m.

The man who had been identified only as James, was afraid a warrant would be issued if he didn't show up.

'No way to get up there, so I walked,' he told Channel 2 news. The man asked to only be identified as James.

'As soon as the air hit my lungs it took my breath away because of the wind. That was the major thing, the wind,' James said.

Police said they aren't sure how he survived the 8-hour journey.

Officer Andy Blimline was inside the courthouse when James came in, huffing and puffing from the cold.

'I was just joking with him, and I said, 'What, did you run here?'' Blimline told HLN.

'No, I walked,' James replied.

Temperatures on Tuesday morning plunged to 6 degrees, with Wind chills making the air feel like 10 degrees below zero - the coldest temperature since February 1996.

Frozen road: James began his walk to court at 1am in order to arrive for 9am. He didn't want to accept the offer of a cab fare home initially

Just as James was about to begin the long trek home after his court appearance, Officer Blimline stepped in and offered to pay for a cab ride back.

'I asked him, 'Hey, did you find someone to come and pick you up?'' Blimline said. 'He said he didn't have money for a cab, and I said, 'Well let me pay for you.' At first he said no, but I told him I wouldn't take no for an answer.'

James adamantly refused, but Blimline the officers chipped in to pay for the $80 ride.

'You could see in the man's eyes that he was genuinely touched, as I was,' said Lt. Chris Dusik. 'I'm truly proud of how Officer Blimline represented the city.'
