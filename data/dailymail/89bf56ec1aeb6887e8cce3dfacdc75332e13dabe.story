A Chinese millionaire is on a mission to build 100 fairytale castles - but officials want to tear them down because they think they are ugly.

Liu Chonghua made his millions in the catering industry by making cakes and has already built seven palaces in China.

But he is now planning to extend his eccentric property portfolio and wants to build a home which resembles Windsor Castle in the southwestern city of Chongqing.

Grand: Millionaire Liu Chonghua has already built seven castles in China but wants to build more

Mr Chonghua was brought up poor but after making his fortune he turned his hand to building castles

He said: 'I don't have any hobbies except for planting trees and building castles.

'When I was a child I heard stories about princes and castles. I wanted to turn the castles of dreams into something real.'

Mr Chonghua was brought up poor and was sent to dig ditches during the political upheavals of the 1960s.

But after making his fortune he turned his hand to building castles. 

He says he is inspired by the buildings in Munich and the chateaux of France's Loire Valley citing Spanish architect Antoni Gaudi, designer of Barcelona's Sagrada Familia cathedral.

One upon a time: Mr Chonghua was brought up poor but after making his millions he decided to build a portfolio of castles

But planning officials have not been so appreciative of his designs. Two years ago they sent diggers to demolish a 16metre high castle gate. 

'The government has never appreciated me', he said. 'They said I've offended local officials. I got anonymous calls from someone threatening to run me over with a car.' 

Despite this, Mr Chonghua has spent more than 100million yuan on building his dream homes which have become a hit with tourists.

Controversial: Planning officials have not been so appreciative of Liu Chonghua designs

People flock to the buildings to have their photos taken outside and many believe daring new property projects are good for China which has cities that often have the same appearances. 

Other Chinese property magnates have also engaged in bizarre construction projects.

One businessman has built imitations of both the Great Pyramid of Giza and the palace of Versailles on his corporate campus But Liu has ambitions for more.

'I have achieved half of my dream,' he said. 'The next part is building better and more awesome castles, the kind that will astound people.'
