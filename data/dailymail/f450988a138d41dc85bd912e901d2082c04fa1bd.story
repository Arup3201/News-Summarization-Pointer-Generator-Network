England have cleared Owen Farrell and Billy Vunipola to fly out to New Zealand, despite the two Saracens players limping off during Saturday’s Aviva Premiership final.

Head coach Stuart Lancaster and his assistants watched the match at their Auckland hotel and would have been alarmed by the sight of their leading  fly-half and No 8 struggling with injuries. 

However, following urgent assessments, the pair were deemed fit to join the squad ahead of the three-Test series against the All Blacks.

Farrell was withdrawn from the fray in some discomfort after kicking the ball into the crowd to celebrate scoring a try which was subsequently ruled out. Vunipola was limping and holding his ankle before being replaced, but Lancaster played down the double scare.

‘We left a medical team in London,’ he said. ‘They assessed the players and everyone has come through unscathed, give or take bumps and bruises. It was cramp for Billy rather than anything more serious. Owen was cramp as well.’ 

The build-up to the tour has been blighted by injury setbacks and the fixture clash which means those players who took part in the Premiership final cannot be considered for the first Test. As the series approaches, the condition of several players remains a worry. 

‘Joe Marler will be fine to train,’ said Lancaster, in reference to the Quins prop who was nursing a hip injury. ‘Tom Johnson picked up a bit of an ankle injury. Billy Twelvetrees still hasn’t trained fully. We’ll see how he progresses. I wouldn’t say he’s doubtful yet, but the clock is ticking.’

The front row has been an area of particular concern to the coaches, who will be without their first-choice props, Alex Corbisiero and Dan Cole, against New Zealand. Many of the obvious understudies have been sidelined too and Lancaster added: ‘Mako Vunipola has had surgery, so is out of the tour. Rob Webber’s knee is good and he will train.

‘Dylan Hartley got on at around 60 minutes in the final and played the extra-time as well. He seemed to come through fine and he’ll be on the plane.’ 

The opening clash with the world champions at Eden Park is shaping up as a major examination of England’s resources below the first-choice XV, as so many of those men will be unavailable.

But after naming a powerful 31-man squad featuring recalled back-rowers Jerome Kaino and Victor Vito, All Blacks coach Steve Hansen warned England pose a serious threat. ‘They have been the most improved side in world rugby in the last two years,’ he said. ‘Those who think England will be fielding a weak side in the first Test are completely underestimating the depth in the England squad. They have a very strong belief that they can win this series. 

‘Having said that, so do the All Blacks.’
