Team news

With injuries decimating the Arsenal squad, Arsene Wenger has a few selection headaches, particularly in defence, ahead of this match with Anderlecht as the Gunners look to build on their 4-1 win over Galatasary.

Starting in goal is expected to be the very inexperienced Emiliano Martinez. The 22-year-old comes into the team after the suspension to No 1 Wojciech Szczesny - sent off against the Turks - while David Ospina is out with a thigh injury.

Calum Chambers returns from his own suspension and could replace either Hector Bellerin at right back or Nacho Monreal at centre back. Laurent Koskielny is still suffering with an achillles problem.  

Jack Wilshere and Aaron Ramsey should both take their place in the Gunners midfield, but Theo Walcott is unlikely to feature as he continues his return from long-term injury.

Lukas Podolski has recovered from illness.

Anderlecht, meanwhile, are missing defender Fabrice N'Sakala.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)  

Anderlecht and Arsenal have faced each off only twice in European competition – that was in the final of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1969-70.

These two matches ended with one win for each team, but Arsenal lifted the trophy, by winning 4-3 on aggregate.

There have been 12 previous meetings between Arsenal and Belgian sides: the Gunners have lost only three times (W7 D2). The Gunners have won each of their last five against teams from Belgium.

Anderlecht suffered their worst loss in Europe against an English side: 10-0 against Manchester United in the European Cup preliminary round in 1956/57

The Gunners’ joint-biggest win in Europe came against a Belgian team, beating Standard Liège 7-0 in the Cup Winners Cup in 1993/94.

Arsenal have found the net only once in their last four away games in European competition, including qualifying.

Anderlecht’s last win in Europe came November 2012 (1-0 against Zenit St. Petersburg), with seven losses and three draws since.

The Belgians have conceded in each of these 10 matches, 2.6 per game on average.

Only one of the last six Anderlecht's Champions League goals has been netted by a striker.
