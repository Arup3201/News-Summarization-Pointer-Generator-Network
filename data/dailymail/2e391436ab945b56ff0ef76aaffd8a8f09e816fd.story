The taxman is demanding powers to seize money  from couples’ joint bank accounts – even if one partner owes nothing.

HM Revenue and Customs wants to be able to take money from any account – including Isas and joint accounts –  if it believes someone owes taxes.

MPs will today launch a withering attack on the controversial proposal, which they say could cause ‘serious detriment’ to  ordinary taxpayers.

Under new powers being requested by HM Revenue and Customs, the taxman would be able to seize cash from from joint accounts and Isas if they believed one of the account holders owed money

The Treasury select committee warns: ‘This policy is highly dependent on HMRC’s ability to accurately determine which taxpayers owe money and what amounts they owe – an ability not always demonstrated in the past. Incorrectly collecting money will result in serious detriment to taxpayers.’

Under the proposal, HMRC will be able  to take all the money a person owes out of their bank account, building society account or Isa ‘without the need to apply to a court’.

HMRC insists it will not take the money unless the person has at least £5,000 left across all their bank accounts, including Isas, after the debt has been paid. It will not ‘create or increase overdrafts’.

Anybody who owes more than £1,000  could be affected and HMRC expects to seize £375 million over the next four years.

But experts warn that many couples are secretive about their finances, do not know what each other earns, and never discuss their finances or whether or not they have paid their tax bills.

Robin Williamson, of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, said: ‘The problem is HMRC’s “shoot first, ask questions later” approach.’

Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, added: ‘Clearly, it needs a safeguard because otherwise it will hit people who have no idea that their husband or wife is a complete rogue.’

Innocent victims of the policy could include pensioners who put money into a joint account, managed by younger relatives. If their younger relative owes taxes, the money could be seized, even though it belongs to the elderly person.

When the plans to raid accounts were published in the Budget, there was no mention of joint accounts. The proposal was first mooted in an HMRC consultation  document released this week.

Anthony Thomas, of the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, said the proposals – subject to a consultation which ends on July 29 – posed ‘far too great a risk’ to ordinary Britons.

He said: ‘If strictly observed, the safeguards and conditions as set out should be broadly effective but if they are disregarded, vulnerable taxpayers will suffer – and that is far too great a risk.’

The consultation document said HMRC expects 17,000 people a year will be hit by the new rules, known as the ‘direct recovery of debts’.

Typically, they will owe an average of £5,800 in tax. The document acknowledges the importance of ‘striking a balance between recovering money from debtors while protecting the rights of other account holders’.

But it said its new powers must include joint accounts, or it would ‘provide an obvious opportunity for debtors to circumvent paying what they owe’.

It suggests a ‘pro-rata’ system, whereby HMRC could deduct 50 per cent of the credit balance of a joint account to pay a tax debt.

But Mr Williamson said it was wrong to withdraw 50 per cent of the money from a joint account because many couples did not contribute money to a joint account on an equal basis.

He added: ‘For example, a woman might be putting in all the money while her husband is pursuing an unsuccessful business venture and has run up a tax debt.’

David Gauke, exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘It will help to level the playing field between those who pay  what they owe when they owe it, and those who do not.’

Britain is being robbed of £35 billion a year by cheats who don’t pay their taxes and others who find ways of avoiding  paying them, according to HMRC.

A spokesman said: ‘We will be including joint accounts. If we didn’t, there would be an opportunity for debtors to get out of paying what they owe.’
