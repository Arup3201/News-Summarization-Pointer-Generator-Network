A former Moulin Rouge showgirl who enjoyed a lavish globe-trotting lifestyle by cheating the benefit system was jailed for 12 months today after returning from her Spanish hideout.

Mother-of-two Dawn Orton, 47, fled Britain to Malaga to avoid her trial at Hull Crown Court telling the judge it would have to be moved 1,600 miles to Gibraltar to accommodate her.

Orton used taxpayers' cash to go on 41 holidays in 13 years, scuba diving with sharks, skiing and even bought a convertible Mercedes.

In her absence she was convicted of benefit fraud for claiming widowed mothers allowance for 13 years and sentenced to 12 months in prison.

But justice finally caught up with Orton at Hull Crown Court today after she flew back to the UK with an international arrest warrant hanging over her head.

The mother-of-two presented herself to Queens Garden Police Station, in Hull, on Friday, where she was further charged with absconding and spent the weekend in the cells before appearing at court today.

Looking tanned, she relaxed in the dock with her arm over the back of the seat dressed in a black A-line coat with a fur collar.

Her former partner Marc Lissimore, 47, who reported her to the police, watched from the public gallery.

Defence barrister Julia Harrow said Orton had a mental melt down over Christmas and could not remember what had happened to her during her time in Spain. 

She said the first she knew she was guilty was when she saw a wanted appeal on Look North Television from a bar in Spain.

But the court heard that Orton, who worked at the Moulin Rouge in Paris, started her claim for incapacity benefit for an injured shoulder - even though she played badminton for a club and went on skiing trips.

Judge Jeremy Richardson, QC, said 
Orton had written to the court saying she was holidaying in Spain and 
perhaps the court could move to Gibraltar to accommodate her there.

'This
was audacious. She has been massively impertinent. We have heard she 
claimed incapacity benefit while able to go on skiing trips,' he said.

'She was able
to play badminton in Cottingham for several months. Even more audacious
she was able to buy a nearly new Mercedes Benz. The public purse should
not be wasted.

Jailing her Judge Richardson said he did not accept she had any mental health problems and knew full well the importance of attending her trial.

He even said he had offered to put the trial back a day while she was told to attend by email - but she did not respond adding: 'You were in Spain with a new lover. You decided to priorities your relationship with him over coming to court.

'The message must go out very clearly that the courts will not be paralised by absentee defendants.

'You received a fair trial. It is plain to me you ignore the order of the court to attend for trial.

'It appears you were able to play badminton for a long period while you were receiving incapacity benefit and taking skiing holidays.

'I simply brand you an extremely foolish woman. You have brought this on yourself.'

After her husband’s suicide in 1996, the showgirl began receiving an allowance for widowed mothers.

Orton and company director Marc Lissimore, 47, moved into their £280,000, five-bedroom home in Cottingham, East Yorkshire, in 1996. They also bought a craft shop.

A jury found her guilty after a two-day trial of a single charge of failing to declare a change in circumstances to the Department of Work and Pensions for thirteen years.

Mr Lissimore welcomed the verdict. He 
said: 'Dawn expects the world to run around her. She will not believe 
she has done anything wrong.

The company director described her as: 'The girl at school who would date boys and collect a ring before moving on. 

'I found out she was seeing a guy from the US. She turned on me. I told her I wanted to get her back but now I cannot even contact her.'

He added: 'Her whole life has been about greed. Taking as much cash as she can from anyone.

'I have written to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs asking them to investigate why she received working tax credits.

'I have rung the hotline about her but they have done nothing so far. So I have taken it up with my MP Alan Johnson and got his office to chase HMRC.'

He said during their time together while she illegally claimed benefits they holidayed in Tenerife, Benidorm, Ibiza, Majorca, Lanzerotte, Feuta Venutura, Rhodes, Eygpt, Barbados, Granada, and Antiqua.

However, according to Mr Lissimore she is not in touch with her sons Reece, 19, and CJ, 22, - Reece lives with him.

He said she is now living in a village near Magaluff in Spain with her boyfriend, yacht salesman Roger Bailey.

Orton now faces an investigation under the Proceeds of Crime Act to claim back her ill-gotten gains.

There will be a hearing at Hull Crown Court on April 4.

She was also ordered to spend an extra 28 days in jail for running off to the Costas.
