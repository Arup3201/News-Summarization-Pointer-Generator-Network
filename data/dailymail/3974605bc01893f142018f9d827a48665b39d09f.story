The body of a sixth family member who fell out of their plane before its crash Thursday afternoon has been recovered approximately a half a mile from the wreckage police in Florida report.

Officers with the Polk County Sheriff's department believe 13-year-old Boston Bramlage was thrown from his family's aircraft immediately before its crash landing near Tampa.

About six feet of the plane's right wing fell off prior to its crash and is still unaccounted for with an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board on-going.

Scene: The 13-year-old was found about a half mile away from the scene of the crash, where the rest of his family was found

'We know there is a gaping hole in the aircraft in the area of one of the seats,' Polke County Sheriff Grady Judd told KCTV during their search efforts for the boy.

Boston's parents Ron Bramlage, 45, and Rebecca Bramlage, 43, as well as siblings Brandon, 15, Beau, 11, and Roxanne, 8, all from Junction City, Kansas, were killed in the wreckage.

Mr Bramlage, a business man who owned Roadside Ventures LLC, was piloting the  2006
Pilatus Pc-12/47, a single-turboprop, fixed-wing 
plane he purchased just one month ago when it went down around 12.30pm.

'The pilot of another aircraft heard the pilot of this aircraft announce a mayday, gave his call sign, but was not specific about the nature of the emergency,' Tim Monville, a Senior Air Safety Investigator with the NTSB told WOFL.

Several witnesses reported seeing the aircraft appearing 'flat' and 'rotating' before its crash, according to Sheriff Judd.

The family were returning home from a vacation in the Bahamas where they have relatives.

Over 100 volunteers scoured the rural terrain before the boy's discovery Friday.

'We are looking for this child as if he were our child out here,' Sheriff Judd told KCTV during their search.

'It's pretty rough terrain, the only real way to access it is by swamp buggy, or ATV,' Joe Brooks, who is an investigator with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission told WOFL.

In the family's hometown, friends gathered to light candle's outside their home, both overtaken by the news but relieved after the last family member's recovery.

'It's just a horrific loss,' Junction
City Mayor Pat Landes said, adding that the couple supported many local
projects and provided college scholarships.

The family was well known 
in town and at Kansas State University, where the basketball arena is 
named for Ron Bramlage's grandfather.

At least two dozen bouquets of flowers 
lined the black wrought-iron fence surrounding the family's ranch-style 
home by Thursday evening. A trampoline sat in the front lawn, and a 
hammock hung between two large trees in the wooded yard.

Standing in his front yard across the
street, Rick Bazan said he had been friends with Ron Bramlage since 
childhood.

He said his friend would often help local families 
financially, such as paying for kids to go to wrestling camps if their 
parents couldn't afford to send them.

Condition: Ron Bramlage only purchased the plane a month ago before its crash Thursday afternoon

Unclear: The cause of the crash wasn't immediately known, and parts of the plane were found miles away

He said Rebecca, who was president of the local school board, 'never stopped working. She was tireless.' She would be embarrassed by the outpouring of support now at her home, where at least a half-dozen friends of the couple's children were always running around, Bazan said.

'It's going to be a long time getting over this one,' he said as he watched the family's neighbors and friends gather outside.

Bella Omann, 14, who went to middle school with the two younger boys, said Beau 'was really the funniest kid I've ever met.'

She had an advanced geometry class with Boston, whom she said 'loved reading books. We would always talk about our favorite books,' including the Harry Potter novels. He read so much, she said, that their teacher wouldn't allow extra material on students' desks to keep him from reading.

Search efforts: Over 100 volunteers searched for the boy who is suspected as having been sucked out of the hole left by the plane's detached wing

Another neighbor, Joann Williams, recalled driving by the home and seeing the children bouncing on the trampoline. 'They were just a beautiful family. They were just so together, cohesive,' she said.

The couple were graduates of Kansas State University and members of the K-State Alumni Association, President's Club, Foundation Trustees and Ahearn Fund.

'The Bramlage family holds a special place in the history of Kansas State University and K-State Athletics, and Ron and Becky have been loyal supporters and great fans of K-State. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Bramlage family during this difficult time,' University President Kirk Schulz and Athletics Director John Currie said in a joint statement.

Ron was the grandson of the late Fred Bramlage, a 1935 graduate of K-State and Junction City businessman. Fred Bramlage was the lead contributor to the construction of Bramlage Coliseum, a multipurpose arena that opened in 1988 and is home to the K-State men's and women's basketball teams.

Mourning: Beloved in their hometown, friends left flowers and lit candles outside the family's house in mourning

A library in the city is named for Ron Bramlage's grandmother, Dorothy Bramlage.

Ron Walker, superintendent of the local school district, said the family was down-to-earth despite their wealth and famous name. He said Rebecca, along with heading the school board, was a board member of the local school foundation.

'I've been here about 10 years now. She and Ron, they were among the first people to greet me. I didn't even know they had any wealth at all for about five years. It was just, "How can we help you, how can we serve?'''

The 4,900-acre Tiger Creek Preserve about 50 miles southwest of Orlando contains hardwood swamps, hammocks, scrubby flatwoods, pine flatwoods, sandhill and longleaf pine/wiregrass habitat, according to its website.

The family had stopped for customs in Fort Pierce, Florida, and had taken off half an hour before the crash.
