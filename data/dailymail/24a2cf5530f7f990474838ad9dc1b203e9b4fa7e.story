A mother-of-two has spent a year training hard and eating clean to achieve a body like her idol Jodie Marsh. 

Amy Humble, 26, from West Hull, East Yorks, wanted to banish her post baby belly and become as toned as the former glamour model.

She said: 'Jodie Marsh inspired me. She looks great - just like her I wanted to have a great physique and still look feminine. I really admire her.'

Super toned: Amy Humble, 26, trained six days a week and ate 'clean' to transform her figure

Amy emulated Jodie's figure by weight training six days a week under the guidance of personal trainer Dan Welburn. She also started eating more healthily.

The mother to Lily, eight, and Brooklyn, six, said: 'Before I started weight training I hated the gym and my belly wasn't toned because I was eating the wrong foods and the weight was just going on my stomach.

'I have always been inspired by Jodie Marsh but I'd never trained using weights so was a bit intimidated.'

She added: 'Once I got started, I realised how out of shape I had looked. I started eating "clean", so lots of chicken, fish and steak with vegetables and plain carbs like rice and potatoes. But I'd also have a cheat day and enjoy a full Sunday roast dinner.'

Amy used to work as a usher at Hull Magistrates' Court but gave up her job to have more time to train.

She has now gone from being an 'out of shape' size 10 to a super toned size 8 and was recently delighted to win a National Amateur Body Builders Association competition after she was named Miss Toned Figure.

She said: 'I was stunned when I won. My dream was to come in the top six but I could not believe it when I came joint first. It didn't sink in for ages and, once I was back at home, I just kept looking at the photographs.'

Her biggest fans: Lily, eight, and Brooklyn, six, are proud of their mother

She said her parter, Craig, 28, has been there for her '24/7' to help her achieve her goals. But not everyone has been fully supportive.

She explained: 'I did face criticism when I first started weight training. People have this idea that you will get big and look like a man if you train with weights but it's not been like that at all.'

But she has since received many compliments about her new look. 

'I've had so many mums stop me in the playground about how I've changed the way I look and how determined I've been to find the time to do this. I wouldn't change my lifestyle for anything now,' she said.

New lifestyle: Amy left her job as a court usher to work at a gym and wants to be a personal trainer

Amy now works at Xercise4Less gym and hopes to become a personal trainer. She said: 'I would love to inspire other women and show them there's nothing to be afraid of by toning up.'

She added that she is already inspiring her children to keep fit. 

'My kids love it and they like to say how their mum is training weights and they would like to do it when they are older. I'm really happy with where I am now and what I have achieved.

'I thought about weight training for years but didn't think it was possible but now I realise you can do it naturally if you put in the hard work.'
