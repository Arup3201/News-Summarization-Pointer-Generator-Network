A teenager who stabbed to death his friend with a replica Lord of the Rings sword has been jailed.

Father-of-one Danny Jones, 21, died after a fight in Oswestry, Shropshire, having spent the evening with 19-year-old Richard Reece before an argument broke out over the victim's parenting skills.

The pair clashed in the street and Mr Jones knocked Reece to the floor as friends tried to pull them apart, a court was told. Reece then walked away but returned with an 11in blade.

He used this to stab Mr Jones once in the stomach, Birmingham Crown Court heard. The weapon was an ornamental replica short sword carried by Frodo Baggins in The Lord of the Rings films.

In the trilogy based on the books by JRR Tolkien, the hobbit - played by actor Elijah Wood - carries the blade called Sting with him, which glows blue whenever he is near an orc creature.

Reece was cleared of murdering his friend after a two-week trial. But a jury found him guilty of manslaughter and he was jailed by Judge Melbourne Inman QC for 12 years on Wednesday.

Sentencing, the judge said that the killing had had a 'devastating effect' on Mr Jones's mother Lisa, and told Reece: ‘You are a normal 19-year-old but there is still room for improvement in maturity.’

During the trial, Reece told the court he was ‘shocked and scared’ when he realised he had injured Mr Jones and claimed he only intended to frighten him.

The court heard Mr Jones was rushed to 
Royal Shrewsbury Hospital after he was stabbed on April 24 this year but
died while undergoing emergency surgery later that night.

In a victim impact statement which was read out in court, Mr Jones’s mother Lisa McNeil said: ‘Every day I’m hanging on by the fingertips trying to get justice for Danny.

‘The bond I had with him was more than special as he was my only child. Our life was full of laughter and life and now it’s silent and empty.

‘The day he got the apprenticeship was the best day in his life. He had the world at his feet and a beautiful son who he will never see grow up.

‘However long Reece gets, one day he will walk back into his mother’s arms. Danny and I will never have that again.’

Rachel Brand, defending, said: ‘As soon as it had happened he was overwhelmed with an immense feeling of regret. He hopes that Danny Jones’s family will come to accept that that was a genuine feeling.’

After the hearing, Detective Inspector Steve Tonks, who led the investigation for West Mercia Police, described the tragedy as ‘another sad and pointless death’.

He added: ‘This incident demonstrates, yet again, that the carrying of knives or other bladed weapons runs a huge risk of ending in tragic consequences.

‘What started as an argument and developed into a scuffle, resulted in a young man losing his life because a blade was produced.

‘Reece left the scene to arm himself and the moment he took the sword back to confront Danny, there was always the risk of a fatal outcome. This case sends out a clear message about violent crime and those prepared to arm themselves with weapons.

‘Anyone carrying a knife or similar bladed instrument as a weapon will be arrested, charged and put before the courts. They can expect a lengthy prison sentence.’
