A mother and her son both suffer from a devastating allergy to the sun which means any exposure to it causes them agonising pain.

Claire Turner, 50, and son Sam, 13, have a rare medical condition called erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) - a condition which causes the skin becomes incredibly sensitive to natural light.

Any exposure to the sun causes them agonising pain and Sam’s allergy is so severe he has to remove some light bulbs in the family home because they cause his skin to feel as though it’s on fire.

Claire and Sam Turner have a rare genetic condition which makes their skin incredibly sensitive to sunlight

As a result, they are forced to stay under cover in the daylight hours and wear long sleeves, gloves and even masks to avoid spending days in agony.

Ms Turner and Sam even have to cover their faces with scarves if they venture out in sunlight.Sam’s condition is so severe it is also triggered by low energy light bulbs and fluorescent strip lights - meaning every unknown building can be a danger to his health.

Ms Turner, from Thame, Oxfordshire, said: ‘We’re like a vampire family - we can’t come out in the sun and live our lives in the dark.

‘If I stay in the sun for longer than a few minutes it feels like somebody is pouring boiling water over me.

‘Sam is even affected by low energy light bulbs or fluorescent tubes, we have to remove the bulbs from the ceilings at school so that he has an area where he can sit in darkness.

If they go outside during the day, Ms Taylor and Sam both have to completely cover their exposed skin to avoid suffering an agonising reaction which makes them feel like they are having boiling water poured over them

‘He lives his life looking up - to make sure he doesn’t get hit by the wrong kind of light.’

The windows in the family’s house and car are specially protected against UV rays and they now have a mobility badge so the family can park in spaces nearest to shops and limit exposure to the sun.

Ms Turner’s daughter Jo, 16, carries the EPP gene but is not light sensitive - meaning she can go outside in the sun without horrendous pain.

Ms Turner said: ‘I thought my children had escaped the condition - until my youngest Sam started having reactions to the light at the age of eight.

EPP occurs when there is a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood.

The skin is more sensitive to longer ultraviolet wavelengths (UVA) and to visible light.

It is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem.

As a result of this enzyme deficiency, protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood.

As
 blood passes through the skin, the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy 
from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly 
damage surrounding tissues.

The
 nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain, 
and if the blood vessels are affected, they can leak fluid, causing 
swelling.

The condition is hereditary and symptoms include developing tingling, itching and burning when exposed to sunlight.

There is currently no cure.

‘I was devastated - he’s had to learn to live his life all over again by keeping out of the light.

‘If the other boys go outside he can’t go with them - he sits in his room playing Play Station.’

At work as a nursery nurse, Ms Turner has a special black tent for when the children go outside to allow her to perform her duties while staying out of UV rays.

She said: ‘Every outing has to be strategically planned - we have to sit at the back of restaurants away from the windows, and we can’t visit swimming pools with glass roofs.

‘We spend our time skirting round the edge of buildings to avoid the sun - the only place we can go easily is the cinema - because we can just sit in the dark.’

The condition means that the family can’t visit hot countries or spend days outside.

Ms Turner said: ‘The best family holiday we ever had was a cruise, Sam and I could spend our days below deck playing games and activities whilst Jo sprawled in the sunshine.

‘It’s hard for Sam - it’s something we’ll both have to live with for the rest of our lives.’

The pair have been supported by the British Porphyria Association and now give talks about dealing with the rare condition at their meetings.

Hermione Lawson from The British Skin Foundation said: ‘Erythropoietic protoporphyria, also known as EPP, is a rare skin disease that causes the skin to become oversensitive to sunlight.

‘When sunlight reaches the skin, either directly or indirectly, it causes tingling, itching or burning, even redness and swelling, and can be very painful.

‘The condition usually starts in childhood, and although it is a hereditary condition, it is not always passed on from parent to child - so it is not unusual to have just one child with the condition.’

EPP occurs when there is a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood.

Ms Turner's daughter, Jo, does not have the condition and so is not sensitive to sunlight

It is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem.

As a result of this enzyme deficiency, protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood.

As blood passes through the skin, the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly damage surrounding tissues.
