The new Premier League fixture lists, which were revealed on Wednesday morning, have been both cruel and kind to next season's expected title challengers.

Reigning champions Manchester City face a tough start, with early games against Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea, while arch-rivals Manchester United have a kinder introduction to the new campaign with clashes against Swansea, Sunderland and Burnley.

Sportsmail reviews the opening five games for the Premier League's six biggest clubs: City, Liverpool, United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham.

Manchester City

Newcastle (a) - 16 August

Liverpool (h) - 23 August

Stoke (h) - 30 August

Arsenal (a) - 13 September

Chelsea (h) - 20 September

Not the start Manuel Pellergini would have been hoping for.

A tough trip to St James' Park on the opening day is followed by the visit of Liverpool.

In fact, the Barclays Premier League champions also face title contenders Arsenal and Chelsea in their first six fixtures.

City could easily be playing catch up by the time October rolls around.

Games against Hull and Stoke should be fairly comfortable three points for Pellegrini's side - but the Chilean would have been hoping for a something a bit kinder.

Their run-in isn't as daunting, however, with a clash against Tottenham about as difficult as it gets in their final four fixtures.

Verdict: Losers

Ouch: Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini faces a tricky start to their Premier League defence next season

Tough start: Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho scored the winner in their 3-2 victory vs City last season

Southampton (h) - 16 August

Manchester City (a) - 23 August

Tottenham (a) - 30 August

Aston Villa (h) - 13 September

West Ham (a) - 20 September

What are the chances of Rickie Lambert scoring against former club Southampton during his Anfield debut on the opening day?

That fairytale scenario will disguise what could be a tough first match for Brendan Rodgers' side against last season's surprise package, now under Ronald Koeman's rule.

And with the Mersysiders' next two fixtures against champions Manchester City and Tottenham - both away from home - it doesn't get any easier for the Merseysiders.

Their final six games are not so daunting, though, with a trip to Chelsea looking like their toughest encounter from their final six fixtures.

Verdict: Losers

Testing encounters: After tough games against City and Southampton Liverpool then travel to Tottenham

Nightmare: Liverpool striker Luis Suarez scored three league goals against Tottenham last season

Manchester United

Swansea (h) - 16 August

Sunderland (a) - 23 August

Burnley (a) - 30 August

Queens Park Rangers (h) - 13 September

Leicester City (a) - 20 September

As starts go, it doesn't get any better for Louis van Gaal.

The Dutchman will want to hit the ground running next season and the fixture list has provided him with the best possible opportunity to do that. United do not face any of their expected title or Champions League qualification rivals until they welcome Everton on October 4.

However, a sequence of games that will see them face Tottenham, Liverpool, Aston Villa, Manchester City, Chelsea and Everton from March 14 will surely determine their destiny.

As will their clash against Arsenal on the penultimate weekend of the season.

Verdict: Winners

Easy going: Manchester United's start to next season is a lot kinder than 'noisy neighbours' City

Deja-vu: United play Swansea in a repeat of last season's opener before facing Sunderland and Burnley away

Chelsea

Burnley (a) - 16 August

Leicester City (h) - 23 August

Everton (a) - 30 August

Swansea (h) - 13 September

Manchester City (a) - 20 September

Jose Mourinho would certainly have settled for this opening.

A trip to newly-promoted Burnley awaits them on the opening day before the welcome fellow new-boys Leicester City to Stamford Bridge.

Away games against Everton and champions Manchester City will provide the West London club with a much sterner test during their first six fixtures - but on the whole Mourinho will be rubbing his hands together.

Their run-in, however, isn't as kind as Chelsea face potential title clashes against Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United in their during their final six games.

Verdict: Winners

Mixed bag: Cheslea play Burnley and Leicester before travelling to Everton on 30 August

Arsenal

Crystal Palace (h) - 16 August

Everton (a) - 23 August

Leicester City (a) - 30 August

Manchester City (h) - 13 September

Aston Villa (a) - 20 September

It doesn't look likely that the Gunners will replicate last season's blistering start that saw them win five of their first six games.

Their opening day clash against Crystal Palace should herald three points - but a trip to Goodison Park follows while clashes against champions Manchester City and north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur will test their early season title credentials by the time October comes around.

Their run-in isn't entirely kind either, with games against Manchester United and Chelsea among their final five fixtures.

Verdict: Winners

West Ham (a) - 16 August

Queens Park Rangers (h) - 23 August

Liverpool (h) - 30 August

Sunderland (a) - 13 September

West Bromwich Albion (h) - 20 September

Mauricio Pochettino won't have to travel too far during the opening weeks of his first season at White Hart Lane.

Five of their first six fixtures are in London - including the mouth watering north London derby against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on September 27.

On the whole, Pochettino will be satisfied with his side's start to the season, with the clash against Arsene Wenger's side, perhaps, the only daunting fixture during the first two months of the season.

Their final day encounter against Everton could have a lot riding on it, though.

It could have been better for Roberto Martinez, but it could certainly have been a lot worse.

An away trip to Premier League new-boys Leicester City awaits them on the opening day, while early games against West Brom and Crystal Palace shouldn't fill the Toffees with too much dread.

But games against Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool during their first six fixtures isn't ideal for the Goodison Park club.

Games against Manchester United and Tottenham in their final five games will make for an awkward ending for Everton.

Verdict: Losers

Tricky: Everton begin their season at Leicester before hosting Arsenal and Chelsea for the end of August
