Prime Minister Tony Abbott appears headed for another showdown with critics within his own party.

It has been reported that everyone except ministers will be banned from the room when Mr Abbott leads a Cabinet meeting next week, to allow for 'gloves off' discussions about his leadership.

Advisers and other staff would be asked to leave the room and there would be no recording or note taking of the discussions, Seven News reports, citing unnamed sources.

The sources said Mr Abbott's leadership and the direction of the government will be discussed as favour grows for either Malcolm Turnbull or Julie Bishop to take the reins.

A secret cabinet meeting to take place at 5pm on Monday is expected to discuss Prime Minister Tony Abbott's leadership and the direction of the government  

However, neither Mr Turnbull, the Communications Minister, or Ms Bishop, the Foreign Minister, are giving any hint of their stance.

Mr Turnbull recently told reporters 'I'll leave you guys to speculate about all that sort of stuff', while Ms Bishop said she wouldn't answer 'hypothetical questions' about running against the Prime Minister.

How Mr Abbott will react to the call for a private meeting at 5pm on Monday is not known, however sources have revealed that at the last challenge to his leadership on February 9, the Prime Minster attempted to ignore the spill by skipping straight to general business discussions.

Despite ministers quickly moving the discussion to Mr Abbott's performance, a vote on whether there should be a leadership contest was defeated 61 to 39 and no challenger emerged. 

Everyone but cabinet ministers will be demanded to leave the room for the meeting, including advisers and note takers

Senior sources claim favour continues to grow for either Malcolm Turnbull (right) or Julie Bishop (left) to take the reins, however both ministers refuse to fuel talk of another leadership challenge 

On Friday Mr Abbott completely dismissed heated speculation that he will be dumped by his colleagues, when asked whether he expected to be in his job by the end of next week.

'Other people can obsess about this kind of insider gossip, but I'm certainly not going to,' he said.

'I was elected to be prime minister. The government was elected to govern the country.

'The people expect the government and the prime minister they elect to go forward doing the job that we were elected to do, and then to submit ourselves to their judgement at the next election. And that's certainly what I expect to be doing.'

Despite Mr Turnbull’s silence, he is understood to have won over many of his detractors on the front bench in a series of private dinners in recent weeks 

Despite Mr Turnbull’s silence, he is understood to have won over many of his detractors on the front bench in a series of private dinners in recent weeks, according to political commentator David Speers.

'Over private dinners he's reached out to those nervous about putting him back into the top job, particularly those on the frontbench who until now have been loyal to Tony Abbott,' Speers wrote.

'No portfolios have been offered and no support has been directly canvassed. But Turnbull has discussed frankly the challenges confronting the Government with senior and junior ministers.'

The Communications Minister denied that he’d been calling his colleagues overnight.
