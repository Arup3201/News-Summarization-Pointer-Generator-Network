New Zealand batsman Lou Vincent released a statement via his lawyer in which he denied reports he has entered into plea-bargaining over ECB corruption charges but said he ‘remains accountable for his actions of the past’.

The former Sussex man was charged on Thursday, along with his ex-county team-mate Naved Arif, with match-fixing offences.

Vincent's charges related to games played in August 2011, a Twenty20 match between Sussex and Lancashire and a 40-over game between Sussex and Kent.

Arif, who played for Pakistan A, is charged with six offences in relation to the 40-over game. Both players have been provisionally suspended from all competition.

Vincent's lawyers said the former New Zealand test opener 'confirms the charges arise from the matters he has disclosed to the authorities, and he remains accountable for his actions of the past.'

'The fact of the charges, and more are likely, dispel any notions of a plea bargain having been done as unfortunately appears to be wrongly suggested by others,' the statement said.
