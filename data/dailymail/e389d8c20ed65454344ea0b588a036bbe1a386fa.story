A Chinese woman  spent an entire week in a KFC eating fried chicken wings after being dumped by her boyfriend because she ‘needed time to think’.

Lovesick Tan Shen, 26, from Chengdu, in China’s southwest Sichuan Province, went to the fast food chain in search of some comfort food to get over the break-up.

But seven days later Tan was still ordering chicken wings with a side of extra large fries at the KFC near a train station by her home.

She even phoned in sick to work to stay at the restaurant. 

Tan said: ‘I was walking around feeling miserable and decided to stop off at the KFC at the train station.

'I hadn’t planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings.

'But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think.

'I didn’t want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.'

After a few days employees at the chicken shop began to worry about Tan.

Tan said she stayed at the fast food restaurant for so long because she 'needed time to think'

Worker Jiang Li Lung, 22, said: 'We work in shifts here and the restaurant is open 24 hours a day, so we get a lot of people coming through.

'At first no one really noticed her.

'But after a few days I began thinking she looked really familiar.

'Then I realised we had been serving her for the past three days and that she hadn’t actually left.

'When we asked her if she was ok, she said she was and just needed time to think.

'And then asked for another box of chicken wings with extra large fries.'

Tan even called in sick to her work so she could spent time at the KFC recovering from her break-up

He said the Tan was doing no harm eating her way through boxes of chicken so they let her stay.

He added: 'She was after all a paying customer, even if a bit of an odd one.'

Tan decided she had had enough when local media turned up after a week at the KFC. And, unsurprisingly, she was starting to get sick of the taste of chicken. 

'I decided the best thing to do would be to leave the city and go back to my parents.

It was only after a week that Tan decided she was 'sick of the taste of chicken' and she went home

'I had already told work I was off sick, so phoned them and said I was leaving.

'And I was getting sick of the taste of chicken so there was no point in staying there anymore.'

She then boarded the next train to her parents' home in Quingdao city in east China’s Shandong Province and left.

Waitress Jiang Li Lung said: 'I guess we kind of miss her. It certainly made work more interesting.'
