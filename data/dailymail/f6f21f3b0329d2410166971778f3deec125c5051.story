Crime writer Patricia Cornwell said 
that when she became successful, she was unprepared to handle it because
of her mood disorder and so she hired a third party to handle her 
financial expenses.

That decision turned out to be a 
costly one as a federal jury just determined that they swindled her out 
of millions of dollars.

The jury awarded Ms Cornwell nearly $51million last week after they found that New York-based Anchin, Block & Anchin LLP were at fault for her disappearing fortune and not her rentals of private jets and luxurious apartments at the Trump Tower.

'For the last couple of years before we left this particular company, it seemed that no matter what I did I never had any more money. I kept thinking "How can I earn this much money and it's not accumulating in any sort of way?" And I began to be very confused and very concerned,' she said on Wednesday.

Telling her side: Intensely private crime writer Patricia Cornwell said that she pursued the lawsuit against her former money manger because she felt that she was sticking up for people who are victimized and aren't able to fight

Despite earning over $10million a year in book sales, Ms Cornwell is reportedly down to her last $13million and has been forced to sell off her helicopter, sports cars and several homes in a bid to reduce her debt.

The tipping point came when the FBI began investigating Ms Cornwell for illegal campaign contributions to Hillary Clinton, only to find out that she had no idea about the contributions but that it was her financial planners making those deposits without her approval or permission.

'The next thing I knew I'm being investigated by the FBI as if I was the one who had done all of this,' she said during an appearance on Katie Couric's talk show.

'What happens to the average person if someone does this to you? I had the means to fight it. I have a voice and I have the funds. But what is really so bad about this is you wonder how many people go through something like this and they have no way to fight it.

Explaining the process: Katie Couric asked Cornwell about how she first discovered her millions were missing

'I mean you have to have millions and millions of dollars to pay your legal fees and that's not fair. Justice should not be this expensive. So I thought we will fight this for everybody- it's not just for me, I'm doing it for you. I don't want anybody ever going through this.'

This scandal is not the first time that her money has been an issue for her, and her first success came at an emotional and mental cost because of her unspecified mood disorders.

'If you're not really prepared for it it can be overwhelming,' she said. 

'Anything that is destabilizing ... makes it harder for you.'

During the trial, Cornwell, 56, 
testified that Anchin moved her from a conservative management strategy 
to an aggressive one without her permission. She said she fired the firm
in 2009 after discovering that her net worth was a little under 
$13million, despite having eight-figure earnings in each of the previous
four years.

She had 
said the firm caused her to miss a book deadline for the first time in 
her career when it failed to find her a suitable place to write after 
renovation work on her house in Concord went on much longer than 
expected.

'This was very 
destabilizing. I really lost my ability to focus and concentrate. I did 
not know what the book was about anymore,' Cornwell said.

The
lawsuit said the missed deadline caused Cornwell to lose one year's 
income: about $15 million in non-recoverable advances and commission.

Defense lawyer James Campbell
said Cornwell's money worries were due to her extravagant lifestyle 
which included spending  $1,000-per-day on a car service, a $10 million 
renovation project at her Massachusetts estate and the $1.2 million 
purchase of a Florida condo.

The best-selling crime author also 
spent  $40,000 a month for an apartment at Trump Tower in New York City,
$200,000 in taxes alone for her customized, personal helicopter, 
$5million for private jets to ferry her across the country and 
$11million for private estates in Concord, Massachusetts. She also had 
several employees, including one who was paid $100,000.

The trial has cast a harsh spotlight on the intensely private 56-year-old. Cornwell lives with her longtime partner, Harvard University neuroscientist Staci Gruber.

Wildly popular: Most of Cornwell's novels center
around Virginia medical examiner Kay Scarpetta. The novels, which have 
sold 100million copies worldwide, are credited with introducing the 
forensic science crime genre

'Where
did the money go? Ms Cornwell and Dr Gruber spent the money,' said 
Campbell. 'You have to consider the large lifestyles involved, the 
spending habits, impulsive buying.'

Cornwell's
crime novels, most of which follow Virginia forensic examiner Kay 
Scarpetta, have made Cornwell a nationally-recognized name. Her books - 
which lean heavily on the use of forensic science - are credited as a 
major influence for the TV show 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.'
