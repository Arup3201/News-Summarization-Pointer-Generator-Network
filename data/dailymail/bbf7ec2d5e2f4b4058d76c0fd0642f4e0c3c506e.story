John Robert, a Bolton businessman has made £86million in a day after selling off part of his 'white goods' website

An entrepreneur who set up his business for a £1 bet took home £86million in a single day after its stockmarket debut.

John Roberts left school without any qualifications and earned the nickname the ‘Kitchen King’ after creating household appliance website AO.com 14 years ago.

After the Bolton-based business was floated on the Stock Exchange on Wednesday, its value soared to a staggering £1.6billion.

He went home with £86million after cashing in 10 per cent of his near 40 per cent stake in the company.

The value of shares in his remaining 28.6 per cent stake rocketed by £113million to around £458million – making the 40-year-old the equivalent of nearly £3,500 a second during the nine hours of trading.

The total value of the company is now only just smaller than rival Dixons, which makes around 15 times more in annual profits.

Mr Roberts, a married father of five, started AO.com after a bet made in a pub when he worked selling kitchen appliances for a distribution warehouse.

‘Like all the best businesses, it started in the pub,’ he told Retail Week. ‘It was Christmas Eve and I was having a drink with Alan Latchford [of parent company DRL Ltd]. He bet me a pound I wouldn’t do it.’

Mr Roberts said he had not heard of the internet at the time, but he used his knowledge of his sector to assemble a database while Mr Latchford – who had internet experience – built the website.

He realised the long supply chain for white goods such as washing machines, fridges and cookers was adding needless costs for customers, so he cut out the middlemen to keep his prices low.

Success story: AO.com smashed expectations for its stock market debut with a 33 per cent rise that increased the worth of Mr Roberts by £113million in less than nine hours of trading

The rise of internet sites and the 
tech industry in general, created a bubble which is generally defined as
 the period of investment 
and speculation in Internet firms that occurred between 1995 and 2001.

A major growth in internet
 users during this time led to many Internet start-ups being born in the mid to late 1990s.

Many of these companies engaged in unusual and 
daring business practices with the hopes of dominating the market as well as engaging in a policy of growth over profit.

At the peak of the dot-com bubble in 1999, it was said that a new millionaire was created every 60 seconds in Silicon Valley.

But many argue that the dotcom boom and bust was a case of too much too fast.

On 10 March 2000, the Nasdaq index of leading technology shares spiked, bursting the Dotcom bubble.

Investors soon realised that the dot-com dream had devolved into a classic speculative bubble.

They were left counting their losses as panic selling ensued as the 
stock market’s value plunged.

Companies such as Boo.com, Clickmango.com, Ready2Shop.com, Pets.com went from being leaders of a revolution to the losers.

Survivors such as Lastminute.com, were left desperately trying to stay afloat.

He
 said: ‘When we started it was all done on dial-up internet. You’d 
refresh the page, go and make a cup of tea and it would have loaded.

'There had to be a very good reason for you to do the 110-metre hurdles 
to get on the site – and that was price.

‘It was 25 per cent cheaper than Currys or Comet.’

AO.com
 – formerly Appliances Online – sells goods directly via its website and
 also for high street chains including Tesco, Argos, B&Q, Next, 
Debenhams and House of Fraser.

It is the UK’s largest online domestic appliance retailer, with a 24 per cent share of the market.But
 the key to success is being ‘fanatical about service’ and having a ‘fun
 working culture’, said Mr Roberts.

His 1,000 employees are given access
 to gym membership and free chocolates and crisps.

He claims he spent 
£50,000 on crisps last year.

‘We make more money the less we worry about
 making money,’ he said.

The company plans to use funds from the 
float to expand in Europe, starting in Germany.

However, analysts have 
warned that the valuation of AO.com at more than five times its annual 
sales of £275million could lead to a crash similar to the dotcom bubble,
 when technology companies saw huge leaps in value in the late 1990s 
before plummeting in 2001.

Several other retail chains are expected 
to float this year, including Poundland, Pets at Home, DFS, House of 
Fraser and B&M Bargains.

The share price rise means his personal fortune increased by nearly £3,700 for every second of share trading
