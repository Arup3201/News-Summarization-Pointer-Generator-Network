Singing their praises: Sir Tim Rice, lyricist, has dontated a whopping £7,500 to UKIP, after be announced he believed they should be 'free from Europe'

UKIP’s campaign to win this year’s European elections received a boost last night with the news  that music impresario Sir Tim Rice has donated cash to the anti-Brussels party.

The Oscar-winning lyricist, a former donor to the Conservative Party, believes Britain should be ‘free from Europe’ and is ‘intrigued’ by the rise in UKIP’s popularity, according to reports.

Sir Tim, the man behind hits such as Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita, is said to have donated up to £7,500 to UKIP last year after meeting party treasurer Stuart Wheeler for lunch.

But the gesture has not been made public until now as the amount given fell below the minimum donation threshold which has to be declared under Electoral Commission rules.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage is aiming to cause a political earthquake in the May elections for the European Parliament by steering his party to the top of the polls and, in doing so, push David Cameron’s Tories into a humiliating third place.

But earlier this month, UKIP showed it was not just a threat to the Conservative Party by coming second in the parliamentary by-election for the Labour seat of Wythenshawe and Sale East in Manchester. Mr Farage’s party came fifth in the constituency at the 2010 General Election.

Sir Rice was formerly a Tory supporter, but has since gone over to the side of Farage's UKIP because of their stance on key issues

Mr Wheeler was quoted as saying: ‘I’m glad to confirm that Tim Rice has actually been a donor to UKIP.  It was about a year ago.’

Sir Tim was once a high-profile Tory supporter, but last year he  said he might no longer vote for them because of Mr Cameron’s enthusiasm for ‘hideous’ wind farms.
