David Cameron today insisted every country in the Commonwealth has agreed that if the royal baby is a girl she will become Queen.

The Prime Minister said news the Duchess of Cambridge has gone into labour is ‘a very exciting occasion’ and the whole country ‘is hoping for the best’.

And he said a 300-year law change will be enacted to ensure a first-born daughter will become monarch even if she has younger brothers.

The historic change was approved by the Queen just four months ago to ensure it was on the statute book ahead of the birth.

The leaders of all 16 Commonwealth agreed to change gender discrimination laws before she was born.

But yesterday it emerged just three outside Britain – St Kitts and Nevis, St Vincent and the Grenadines and Canada - have changed their laws to enact the change.

It was suggested that a first-born daughter would only become Queen in countries which have changed the law, while a younger brother would in theory become king in those who had not.

But today Mr Cameron insisted the deal he reached in October 2011 was binding.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour: ‘I can’t claim any role in this one, except for as Prime Minister I have one small thing, well it’s a big thing actually which is to get all of the heads of the realms over which our Queen is Queen to agree that whatever the sex of the baby that Will and Kate have, if it’s a girl it will be our Queen.

‘Changing the succession is I think a big achievement, very important for our country and for all those realms over which our monarch governs.

‘And something we will find out quite soon whether it’s going to kick into action or not.

‘Everyone has agreed they’ve agreed that even if the legislation hasn’t gone through their parliament it will retrospectively apply to the child, so it’s pretty much a done deal.’

Guarantee: The law change means Prince William and Kate Middleton's baby is certain to be monarch, whether it is a boy or a girl

Change: The Queen gave the new law Royal Assent in April, to ensure it was passed before the birth. It means the change pushed Prince Harry to fourth in line to the throne

The law change means Prince Harry will be pushed into fourth place in the line of succession to the throne.

Mr Cameron led the call for the law to be over-turned to ensure the princess would not be leap-frogged if a younger brother was born later.

It had been feared there could be a constitutional crisis if the royal couple had a baby girl before the law was changed.

But the Queen approved the historic change by giving royal assent to the Succession to the Crown Act in April.

Under the ancient rules of male primogeniture, first born royal daughters in direct line to the throne were over taken by younger male siblings.

But the law was criticised and widely viewed as outdated and discriminatory.

The scrapped law of male primogeniture only allowed Elizabeth II to become Queen because she did not have any brothers.

But the major constitutional change was accelerated after the Duke and Duchess’s wedding in April 2011.

In October that year Mr Cameron announced that the 16 Commonwealth countries where the Queen is head of state had agreed to give female royals the same rights of succession as their brothers.

It meant amending some of Britain’s key constitutional documents, including the Bill of Rights and Coronation Oath Act of 1688, the 1701 Act of Settlement and the 1706 Act of Union with Scotland.

The change in rules is not retrospective, so the Princess Royal will not jump ahead of her younger brothers the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex.

To take full effect it has to be legislated for in all of the Commonwealth nations of the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Grenada, Belize, St Christopher and Nevis, St Lucia, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, St Vincent and the Grenadines and Papua New Guinea.

Had the rule been in force before, British history would have been very different.

Part of the family: The royal baby will join future balcony line-ups in the months and years to come

Constitutional experts say that in 1509 Margaret Tudor would have taken the throne instead of Henry VIII, and as a result Elizabeth I would never have been Queen.

It would also have meant Queen Victoria would have been succeeded by her daughter, Princess Victoria, the Princess Royal, in 1901, and not King Edward VII.

When she died just a few months later, her son Kaiser Wilhelm II would have ascended the throne – something which could have prevented the First World War.

It is said the Queen of England now would have been the completely unknown Princess Marie Cecile of Prussia.

Most European monarchies have already established an equal law of succession - it is in force in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

Now only Spain, Liechtenstein and Monaco are left with the old system.
