A British student who has not been seen since attempting to scale a 19,000ft Peruvian mountain on his own 10 days ago is feared dead.

Experienced rock and ice climber Thomas Jagger, 22, set off to climb the Pisco mountain in Peru on July 24 on his own after his climbing partner was sick.

He left for the glacier in the Cordillera Blanca mountain range in western Peru without his friend Luke Dyer at around 8.30am.

Fears: Thomas Jagger went missing when he tried to scale a Peruvian mountain on his own when his climbing partner was sick

The University of Warwick maths student had travelled to Peru on July 20 to carry out a hiking trip in the famous Alley of Huaylas in the Ancash region.

Jagger’s sleeping bag was reportedly spotted by another trekker at the Moraine Camp, a base camp at 16,240ft where climbers spend the night before ascending the Pisco peak.

A fellow climber who met the pair in Peru, and had breakfast with Mr Jagger before he set off, said: 'His plan was to solo the mountain from the Moraine Camp on the 25th.

'He was soloing the mountain because Luke was sick,' explained the 24-year-old from Washington DC. He ended up climbing alone.

'I don’t think he would have preferred to solo it,' he explained, adding that Luke had been nervous about climbing the peak.

'He was on and off sick. Tom was getting frustrated with the whole thing and decided to just go and climb.

'Unfortunately, there was a big storm the day he planned to summit and we don’t know exactly what happened. He was supposed to summit and return on that same day, the 25th.

'Another climber saw his sleeping bag still at the Moraine Camp the following day.

'We suspect that he might have fallen into a crevasse. This all seems like a nightmare.'

A spokesman from the British Embassy in Lima said: 'We were notified on July 27 that a British national, Thomas Jagger, has been reported missing in Huaraz, Peru.

'We are providing consular assistance to his family at this difficult time.'
