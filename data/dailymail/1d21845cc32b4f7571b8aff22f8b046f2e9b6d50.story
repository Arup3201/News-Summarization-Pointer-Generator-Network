Joe Hart has declared that he totally respects the authority of Manuel Pellegrini, as the Manchester City boss comes under increased pressure at the Etihad Stadium following defeat to Barcelona.

The goalkeeper was outstanding as City were beaten 3-1 on aggregate in the Champions League last-16, with only his string of saves over the two legs preventing Pellegrini's side from an even more embarrassing result.

Hart was dropped by the Chilean following a poor run of form last season, but returned soon afterwards as Manchester City went on to win the Premier League title and the Capital One Cup.

This season has been less straightforward so far, but Hart, speaking to David James during David James meets Joe Hart in a special programme which airs on BT Sport 1 at 6.30pm on Friday, is adamant the under-fire manager retains his total respect.

'It was bad because I never wanted to come out the team, but I had to - the manager made his decision,' said Hart. 'I thought he was fantastic with me how he was. 

'As a manager, I totally respect his authority. He had a decision to make, he didn’t just flip a board and suddenly you’re not playing.

'I just wanted to use the time for the best, and when I did come in, I wanted it to feel natural. I just wanted to slot in. I didn’t want to come in and make a million saves. I didn’t want to come in and change a game. I just wanted to slot back in, that’s the way it should be, and carry on.'

For the second time, Manchester City have  struggled in the Premier League following a title-winning campaign, and Hart admits  his side haven't been good enough this year.

'We’ve definitely got the capabilities and we’ve got the team,' he continued. 'But that’s only half the battle in this league. It doesn’t matter how good you are, or how good you think you are. It’s what you do on the day and you can lose against anyone. 

'I’ve only had two (titles) to defend. I can only speak from that experience and the first one we did find hard because we’d built on everything to get it. 

'I think we would openly admit that the season afterwards we expected that we would do it, that we had cracked it and that we were going to be that team. 

'But we weren’t. We had to fight tooth and nail. We had to change managers. We had to change players. We had to come against all odds to win the league again last season. So I think we are all well aware of how hard it is to win the league in the first place, let alone back to back. 

'But like I say, with the team and set up that we’ve got, we’ve got everything in the right places. That said, to do it is another thing and at the moment it is proving difficult. But we are going to keep trying.'

Hart has won the League Cup, FA Cup and Premier League with City, but still has designs on winning the Champions League, completing a medal haul never managed by an English goalkeeper in history.

He added: '(My dream is) to keep winning those three (domestic titles) as many times as possible and to try and add the European Cup to it.'

But Hart was otherwise superb during the result, with the Spanish press calling him a 'phenomenon'

The 27-year-old stopper received praise from all corners of Europe following his display at Barcelona, with some Spanish press even referring to him as a 'phenomenon'. 

But Hart still rates Germany and Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer as the best in the world in his position.

'His style is something that I don’t think technically you can coach,' said Hart. 'People have got wrapped up in the whole flying out and tackling people and that side of it is not for me, to be honest. 

'But Manuel in terms of dominating a game, being hard to beat, winning World Cups. I remember him right back from when we played him (I didn’t play – I’d got booked in the semi-final) in the under 21 tournaments, just seeing this colossal guy in goal.

'He has kept going and from a few times of meeting him, I like everything about him. I’ve heard some very important people in football say what an animal, and what an amazing talent he is.'
