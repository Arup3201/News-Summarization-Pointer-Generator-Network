Paul Walker’s girlfriend is ‘broken up’ over his death as the couple were hoping for a ‘bright future’ together, MailOnline can reveal.

Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell, 23, is being comforted by her mother Julie as she struggles to cope with the ‘horrible’ news, relatives said.

She has reportedly been dating Walker since 2006 when she was just 16 and he was 33 - but the 17-year age gap has been no barrier to them both finding love.

Jasmine’s uncle Barton Bruner said: 
‘Paul was a really good guy and Jasmine is broken up by this. I went to 
Thanksgiving with him, played golf with him.

‘They had their ups and downs but they were together and looking to spend a bright future together.

‘This is horrible news and unexpected. Her mother is with her and she is comforting her’.

Jasmine,
 a college student who lives in Santa Barbara, California, was 
supposedly beginning to become the step-mother to Walker’s daughter 
Meadow, 15, even though she is only eight years older than her.

'Broken up': Student Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell, 23, is devastated after her boyfriend, actor Paul Walker, was killed in a horrific car accident on Saturday afternoon

Jasmine’s
 presence in Walker’s life may have been one of the reasons why Meadow 
decided to move in with him earlier this year, having spent her entire 
childhood with her mother Rebecca McBrain, who lives in Hawaii.

Meanwhile, a fake Facebook page purporting to belong to Meadow Walker was shut down today.

Walker's reps contacted Facebook directly. On the page, the imposter paid tribute to Walker, calling him her 'real life hero'.

The teenager has not been seen since her terrible loss on Saturday.

Walker, now 40, was raised a Mormon in a working class California family, but his good looks - he was once described as a ‘young Steve McQueen’ - meant he was never lacking female attention.

He also strayed from the family values his parents instilled in him and when he was 18 faced a felony charge though he has never revealed what it was. The case was reduced to a misdemeanor.

When Rebecca got pregnant Walker was 25 but he refused to marry her, claiming that he was not mature enough even though it left him feeling like an ‘evil SOB’.

Walker met his girlfriend, Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell, when he was 33 and she was just 16

In one interview Walker said: ‘I knew
 where I was at with chicks and having fun. I mean, I was sleeping with 
her (Rebecca’s) friends, for crying out loud. You know what I mean?

‘I was an animal, and so I want to be there and my heart wants to be in it, but the mind just isn't following it’.

Walker shared custody of Meadow and has claimed that things were good between him and Rebecca.

He has said: ‘I love my daughter so much, and I love her mom too. We get along so well as a result of me playing it the way that I did.’

Walker had spent Thanksgiving with Meadow and friends and was scheduled to return to Atlanta to continue filming the seventh Fast and the Furious film when he died.
