A serving British soldier who went to fight ISIS was being flown home last night after he was found near the border between Syria and Iraq.

The 19-year-old private serving with the 2nd Battalion of The Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment left for the region last week after telling his parents he wanted to help the Kurdish Peshmerga.

He was the first British soldier to have gone to fight against the terror group and his disappearance fuelled fears that he could have been a prime beheading target for Islamist jihadists. 

The 19-year-old soldier who reportedly left  to fight against ISIS is now returning to his unit, it emerged today

The soldier, who is now said to be ‘safe and well’, was in Dubai on leave from his base in Cyprus when he decided to travel to the war-torn country.

He was due back at his base yesterday when it emerged the Ministry of Defence had located him and were flying him back.

The MoD refused to confirm whether they had found him or whether he had reached out, but last week a defence source said they would not send police to the Middle East looking for him.

Speaking during Commons defence questions, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: ‘The House may also want to know the soldier reported as missing last week has now been located and is being returned to his unit.’

As the soldier was not considered AWOL, it is not clear whether he will face disciplinary action.

A defence source said: ‘We are just grateful to have him back at the moment.’ 

The private is understood to be serving with the 2nd Battalion of The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment

The soldier, who has not been named for security reasons, left his base after sending a message to his family saying: 'I'm with other British people and a Canadian at the moment. I don't know how to explain it to you but I really want and need to do this and I will be safe.

He added: 'I have good skills and I can speak the language, I can help these people and help with this fight. I will get in trouble for being AWOL, but it's minor and no prison sentence.' 

The private joined up at the age of 16 after leaving school and had reportedly been learning Arabic.

He was said to have once shared a barracks with murdered Fusilier Lee Rigby.

He is understood to have visited the area with the military for a training exercise before he decided to return to fight.

He is thought to have been fighting alongside a group called Lions Of Rojava, who have Americans, Canadians and other Britons among their number. 

The serviceman, who has not been named for security reasons, was stationed in Cyprus and is believed to have travelled to the region via Dubai while on annual leave. He is thought to have then entered Iraq

The soldier reportedly posted a picture online over the weekend showing him standing next to Canadian ex-serviceman Brandon Glossop.

In the post, he referred to Glossop as his 'wingman' and, in a message to his family, added: 'I'm all safe guys.' 

The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment are based at the Tower of London, where the soldier will return to find out whether he faces a court martial.  

In December it emerged that two former British soldiers had travelled to Syria to fight against ISIS after feeling 'compelled' to take up arms following the murder of aid volunteer Alan Henning.

News of the soldier came as the Defence Secretary was urged to clarify exactly what Britain's plan is for the campaign against ISIS in Iraq.

Labour MP John Woodcock said it was troubling defence chiefs had failed to outline the objectives for the campaign against ISIS, also known as Isil, in recent evidence to a Commons committee.

Speaking at Commons defence questions, the Barrow and Furness MP Mr Woodcock said: 'Do you think it is acceptable none of the service chiefs who gave evidence to the defence committee's recent inquiry was willing or able to articulate the UK's objective or strategic plan in Iraq? What is our plan exactly?'

Mr Fallon replied: 'Our plan in Iraq is very simple - it is to disrupt threats to the UK mainland and our interests overseas, secondly it is as part of an international coalition to defeat Isil, including discrediting its violent ideology.

'It is thirdly to mitigate the impact of Isil and other violent extremist groups on the stability of the region as a whole.'

It is understood the British soldier joined a group called the Lions Of Rojava, who boast, 'It is better to live one day as a Lion that a thousand days as a sheep.'

They are the foreign fighters who have travelled to Syria to fight, not for jihad, but on behalf of the Kurdish communities who are defending their communities from the advance of Sunni Islamists.

Just as hundreds of young Europeans have gone to fight for the radical Islamists of Islamic State, so increasing numbers are now travelling to fight for their avowed enemies, the Kurds.

Jordan Matson, a former U.S. soldier now with Syrian Kurds' People's Protection Units (YPG), operates The Lions Of Rojava Facebook page openly calling for volunteers to travel to join the fight.

Just as many of the Islamic State's foreign volunteers have been drawn from the ranks of Sunni Muslim youth worldwide, many of the initial YPG volunteers have come from the Kurdish diaspora.

Last August a hairdresser from South London was reported to be the first Briton to travel to fight alongside Kurdish forces. 

Ethnic Kurd Mama Kurda from Croydon, 26, travelled to Iraq to join the Kurdish peshmerga as they desperately tried to halt Islamic State's lightning advance.

But since then many others have been inspired to take up arms against Islamic State, perhaps also inspired by the radical socialist experiment underway in the Kurdish autonomous region of Rojava.

Inspired by the social ecologist and anarchist Murray Bookchin it has adopted a vision of 'libertarian municipalism' calling for Kurds to create free, self-governing communities. 

Last October it was reported that a currently serving British Royal Marine had been questioned by police on suspicion he was travelling to fight with Kurdish militias during his leave.

The 22-year-old Commando was quizzed after he prepared to fly from California on a one-way ticket to Turkey. He was suspected of being in contact with Kurdish militant groups.

Two women, Canadian Jew Gill Rosenberg, 31, and Danish Kurd Joanna Palani, 20, have also reportedly travelled to fight with the Kurds, inspired perhaps by the images of female fighters on the front line against Islamic State terrorists.

It is perhaps the only place in the world where women are fighting on the front line of armed conflict.

There are also claims that a number of European biker gangs have travelled to Syria and are helping to assist the resistance.

Leaders of the Cologne-based Median Empire Motorcycle Club, which has strong Kurdish links, have posted images of their German riders posing in the city - some of them carrying weapons.

The news came just days after three members of a notorious motorcycle gang from the Netherlands were told they had not committed any crime by travelling to Kobani to join the fight against ISIS.
