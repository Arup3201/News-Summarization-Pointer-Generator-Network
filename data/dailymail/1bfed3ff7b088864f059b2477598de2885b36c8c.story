Hands up! Austin police officers woke up Cardona at around 7am and charged him with criminal trespassing

He is seen reclining  in a chair with his feet kicked up on a desk.

Police officers woke up Cardona at around 7am and charged him with criminal trespassing.

He revealed during questioning that he had been out drinking with friends the night before.

A court document shows that police don't suspect that he had any plans to steal from the business and was merely under the influence.

Hudson Meats confirmed that nothing was missing.

'He didn't touch our register, didn't touch any money... [he] didn't even get to eat the sausages that he grabbed from the cooler. He was just drunk and tired,' Ashley Booth, the store's office manager said.

It wasn't immediately clear whether Cardona has an attorney.

 

Insurance money was used to pay for a replacement door.

Scott Grumbles, general manager of Hudson Meats said of the event: 'It could have been 180 degrees from what actually happened. 

'So we take it with a grain of salt and it’s quite entertaining now how it actually all played out and what happened.'
