New Zealand may vote next year on changing its flag, scrubbing out the red, white and blue of the Union Flag to break its ties with Britain.

The country's newly re-elected prime minister, John Key, made the revelation today as the country looks to assert an identity independent of its former colonial overlord.

Key's centre-right government was returned for a third three year term on Saturday in a resounding win, promising to continue steady economic management and controls on spending, and possible tax cuts in three years.

Flag change? The current flag was adopted at the start of the 20th century and features the British Union Flag in the top-left corner with the four red stars of the Southern Cross on a blue background

Asked about his promise of a referendum on a change of flag, Key said he wanted it to be the subject of a referendum next year, including finding an alternative and then putting that up against the current flag.

'I'm obviously a big supporter of the change, I think there are a lot of strong arguments in favour of the change,' he said on the Radio Live network.

Key has previously said he wants a flag uniquely New Zealand in character that would be recognisable around the world.

Changing history: John Key's centre-right government was returned for a third three year term on Saturday in a resounding win. But Key, who has backed a new flag with a silver fern on a black background, acknowledged there would be strong arguments to retain the current flag

All black: New Zealand sports teams, notably the world champion All Blacks rugby team, often compete under a silver fern motif, and the national carrier Air New Zealand has put it on its aircraft tails

Compromise: People have come up with various suggestions for a new New Zealand flag over tthe years, like this by Aaron Nicholson in 2000 made as a 'compromise', but none have ever gained traction

In 2009, a flag was devised which incorporated both the Union Flag and New Zealand's national colours, black and white. The red is the colour of the Maori people of the country. Eleven years earlier, something similar was designed with a silver fern (right)

In 2005, a red,white and blue flag was devised by Kyle Lockwood (left). The blue colour represents the ocean, the red represents the Maori and the blood of soldiers, and white is a reference to the 'Land of the Long White Cloud'. But some have suggested just getting rid of the Union Flag (right)

The Koru Flag (left) has been proposed as a secondary flag for New Zealand, designed by Friedensreich Hundertwasser in 1983. It has a black stripe on the left to represent the Maori and a green curling fern. Then there is the Tino rangatiratanga flag, the Maori national flag (right)

The current flag was adopted at the start of the 20th century and features the British Union Flag in the top-left corner with the four red stars of the Southern Cross on a blue background.

It is often confused with the similar looking Australian flag.

Key, who has backed a new flag with a silver fern on a black background, acknowledged there would be strong arguments to retain the current flag.

The group representing returned soldiers has been a vocal opponent of change, saying the move would disrespect those who had fought and died defending it.

New Zealand sports teams, notably the world champion All Blacks rugby team, often compete under a silver fern motif, and the national carrier Air New Zealand has put it on its aircraft tails.

A survey in March showed 52 percent of respondents did not see any need to change the flag.
