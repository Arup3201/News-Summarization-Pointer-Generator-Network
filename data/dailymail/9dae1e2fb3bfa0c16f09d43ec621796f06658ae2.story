While pensioner Royie Joseph embraces a love for all things miniature, her collection of dolls house ornaments is certainly far from small.

In fact, the retired auxiliary nurse from Petworth, Hampshire, is the proud owner of Britain's biggest collection - having obtained more than 4,000 dolls, items of miniature furniture and animals over the past 40 years.

Incredibly, the 85-year-old's vast collection is displayed on rows and rows of shelves in various scenarios and are all crammed into her one-bedroom flat.

Proud owner: Royie Joseph, 85, has collected more than 4,000 dolls house ornaments over 40 years

Always looking out for her next purchase, Royie admits spending her days rummaging through charity shops and car boot sales across the UK in hope of grabbing a little bargain.

Dedicated Royie said: 'I'm the only person in Britain with a collection like this and probably the biggest in Europe.

'I love going out to try and find hidden treasures, it feels amazing.'

In one corner of her amazing collection is a tiny, fully-equipped miniature kitchen, while in the other are little bedrooms, lounges and even a ballet room and a library.

Royie even has scaled-down pieces of art, including Monet, Beethoven and Van Gogh.

The devoted OAP spends on average Â£1 pound per item, with the cheapest being 10p, while the most she has forked out is Â£5 pounds.

Royie added: 'It's not about money - it's about the enjoyment it gives me. All of my collections come to life - they tell a story.

'The characters all have a name, read to one another and they even have pets.

'I love the expression on their faces and spending time creating scenes for them to stand in - including a wedding, market, music room, tearoom and classroom.

'I call them miniatures, because they are not displayed in a dolls house.

'I have always collected bits and bobs such as magnets, stamps and Disney figures, but this is certainly my biggest collection by far.'

With space for new additions now at a premium, retired Royie says she is willing to give away her entire collection to free up space - and start all over again.

She hopes to give away her collection room by room to museums, libraries or collectors to free up space for more.

Royie said: 'It takes up a lot of space though, so I'm willing to give them away for free on the condition children can enjoy them.

'I want people to take as much pleasure out of them as I have, which will give me more space to collect and display different ones.'
