England coach Peter Moores will return to Old Trafford for the fourth Test against India this week to find himself embroiled in Lancashire membership unrest on and off the pitch.

The county’s poor form this season, coupled with major concern from members at their inadequate facilities in a ground revamped for the corporates to win back Test cricket, has led to calls for wholesale change.

The rebel members, who have enough signatures from a rapidly dwindling membership to demand a special general meeting and a vote of no confidence motion, report that Lancashire’s management have blamed Moores for leaving the side in a poor shape when he took the England job for a second time in April.

The fans’ concerns centre on a flawed structure in which director of cricket Mike Watkinson reports on playing matters to board member and close friend Paul Allott, with the club failing to appoint an overseas batsman at the start of the season while making poor signings and depending too much on young players.

Ian Lomax, one of the action group leaders, said: ‘We have already voiced our serious worries to the club hierarchy but they fully support Watkinson as well as Allott’s role. They intimated that Moores was at fault for the playing policy and not doing enough to sign a top overseas batsman.’

Members’ grouses over Old Trafford involve their pavilion view being greatly obscured by a giant sightscreen that wasn’t see-through as first promised. Lancashire chairman Michael Cairns has said that if members were unhappy with what he had accomplished with the ground development he would consider resigning and taking his board with him.

Scene is set: Old Trafford hosts England's fourth Test against India to start this week 

Oops! Scotland's First Minister drew barely a dozen journalists at his Commonwealth Games wrap-up

Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond, who attracted barely a dozen journalists to his Commonwealth Games wrap-up press conference, said one result of his self-ban on making political capital out of the event was that the Daily Mail had never been more positive towards him. But he fully expects the usual hostilities to resume.

Adam Paker, Commonwealth Games England chief executive who seemingly had little or no role to play in Glasgow, is being remarkably well looked after in his new job as CEO of the grass-roots Amateur Swimming Association.

Paker is understood to be earning a salary of around £150,000 a year in addition to bonuses, first-class travel and the use of a facility to work in London despite the ASA’s HQ being in Loughborough. This largesse, paid for by Sport England, comes after the extravagant decision to split the management of the participation-focused ASA with elite British Swimming.

Rugby Sevens is the only sport that Team England have failed to win a medal at over two Commonwealth Games despite the huge riches of the RFU compared to most of the other sports competing. 

And if England qualify for the debut Olympic sevens in Rio as the GB mandated team, they are unlikely to be able to call on Scottish or Northern Irish players. The two countries are showing no appetite to join a GB side, just like for the football in 2012.

Really? Mike Hooper described Glasgow as the ‘stand-out games in the history of the Federation’

Hooper’s blinkered view

Mike Hooper, the Commonwealth Games Federation chief who deals only in huge positives, described Glasgow as the ‘stand-out games in the history of the Federation’ while passing the buck on the arrest of two Indian sporting officials for assault on the police.

Meanwhile, the BBC may have attracted a healthy peak of 8.4million to watch Usain Bolt’s Jamaicans win the 4x100m relay but their unkempt trackside interviewer Phil Jones should be ashamed of toadying up to Bolt by sympathising with him about being approached by the media while watching netball. Journalists asking questions, whatever next?

When England’s Jack Wilshere went on holiday to Las Vegas, he was pictured smoking and having drink poured down his throat during a swimming pool party. In contrast, when his Arsenal team-mate and German World Cup winner Mesut Ozil was spotted in Vegas last week he was shooting some hoops with the USA’s national basketball team on the University of Nevada campus.
