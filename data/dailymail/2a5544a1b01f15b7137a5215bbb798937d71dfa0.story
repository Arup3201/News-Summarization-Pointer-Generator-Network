Strictly Come Dancing beat The X Factor in the Saturday night ratings battle this week, as the launch show became the most-watched series premiere of all time.

The BBC TV talent show attracted a significant 300,000 more viewers than The X Factor - with a peak audience of 9.4million compared to the ITV show's 9.1million.

Saturday night's launch show of Strictly saw the celebrity contestants paired up with their professional dance partners, as well as musical entertainment from stars including Rod Stewart and Jessie J.

Victory: Strictly Come Dancing won the ratings battle against The X Factor on Saturday night

And it seems the format was more than popular with viewers, as the launch was the most-watched of all time.

The episode had an average audience of 8.4million, compared to 8million in 2012, 7.6m in 2011 and 7.1m in 2010.

Meanwhile, despite being beaten by Strictly in both peak and average ratings figures, X Factor did manage to attract a peak audience of 9.5million if the ITV1+1 figures are included.

Saturday night's episode of The X Factor saw some familiar faces return for another bid at victory.

Jade Richards made it third time lucky
 on Saturday night when she stunned the X Factor judging panel with a 
moving rendition of Bruno Mars hit When I Was Your Man.

Having
 made it all the way to Kelly Rowland's Miami home during the judges 
house's stage of the competition in 2011, she was left bitterly 
disappointed when she wasn't selected for the live shows.

The
 Fife teenager admitted she'd been 'working in supermarkets' since her 
last appearance on the show in 2012, while her job description flashed 
up as 'unemployed' as she sang.

The 23-year-old was sent off with four yeses, but she wasn't the only familiar face on the show.

Amy
 Mottram also returned and was put through to the arena auditions after 
losing out on last year's wildcard to eventual finalist Christopher 
Maloney.

Dolly Rockers also returned with a 
version of Beyoncé hit End of Time and got four yeses for their troubles
 before Dubliner Melanie McCabe made an emotional return for her fourth attempt to make it through to the live shows.

Clearly affected by Melanie's return, Louis broke down as he assessed her performance.

'I know her family need this, I know you need this and I really want it
 for you. I really, really want you to do well,' he said.  'I'm saying 
as very big yes...Melanie this is your time - go for it.'

The X Factor returns to screens on Sunday night for the second round of arena auditions, while Strictly will be back later this month.
