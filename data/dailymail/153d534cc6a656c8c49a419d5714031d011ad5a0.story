A Staffie was found dumped in woodland with a crossbow bolt through his head - missing his brain by just a few millimetres.

Two-year-old Ziggy was found in woods near Wansford in Peterborough by passers-by with the 20-inch arrow pierced through his skull, which may have been there for at least two days.

He was rushed to the vets, who were shocked he survived the attack, and operated on immediately.

Despite the sickening attack, the sweet-natured animal was wagging his tail and asking for affection from staff at the RSPCA.

The charity, which is desperately trying to trace the owners, has released these images from the attack - thought to have taken place earlier this week.

Ziggy can be seen with the giant bolt sticking through his head as he sits in the operating room of the vets. 

Justin Stubbs, an RSPCA inspector, said: 'Despite this bolt going straight through Ziggy's head it miraculously missed his brain, ear capsule and eyes - I could not quite believe it.

'Whoever did this took a very intentional shot at very close range.

'I think they must have been aiming at the back of the head and Ziggy must have moved at just the right distance right at the last minute.

'I don't know whether they then took him deep into the wood and dumped him, or had already taken him into the wood and so just left him there, injured.

'What we are quite sure about is that poor Ziggy was probably roaming about in the middle of nowhere for a couple of days with this bolt stuck in his head.

A large hole can be seen on the side of Ziggy's head just under his ear where the bolt went through after attack

Two-year-old Staffie Ziggy was found in remote woodland with the 20-inch bolt through his head by passers-by 

'He would have been terrified, and in complete agony. It really broke my heart this one.

'What really got me was the way Ziggy sat there, with that bolt through his head, wagging his tail at me in such a good natured way - asking for a bit of a fuss.' 

Ziggy left Vets4Pets in Peterborough yesterday and is now recovering in boarding kennels. 

Inspector Stubbs added: 'He has made a miraculous recovery, he has been jumping all over me - he seems as right as rain.

'At the vets yesterday, he was walking around and wagging his tail, looking for affection. He just happened to have a bolt going through his head.

'It looked like a Halloween mask, it couldn't have picked a better place to go through.

The arrow pierced through the back of his skull and out the side of his face, narrowly missing his brain

'There was very little blood, but watching it pulled out was heart in the mouth moment. The vet was brilliant.

'I have been an inspector for 18 years and I have seen a number of ducks and geese shot with crossbows.

'I have been saying it would soon move onto pets and I have been proved right. Crossbows aren't controlled and they need to be through regulation.' 

The RSPCA is now trying to trace Ziggy's owners and any witnesses to the incident to find out exactly what happened. Anyone with information should call 0300 123 8018.
