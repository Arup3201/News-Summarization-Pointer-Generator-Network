A Michigan man who has witnessed his scrotum balloon to 100lbs over the past decade due to a rare condition may soon be able to have sex with his wife for the first time in years thanks to a life-changing surgery.  

Dan Maurer, from Battle Creek, suffers from scrotal lymphedema - an ailment that has caused one of his testicles to become abnormally large.

The 39-year-old husband said his condition has affected his relationship with his wife of 20 years, Mindy.

Massive problem: Dan Maurer, 39, suffers from a rare condition called scrotal lymphedema, which caused his scrotum to become unusually large and weigh 120lbs. He has now undergone successful surgery to remove the growth

The couple reportedly have not been intimate in seven years due to Dan's illness.

Two months ago, the tale of Maurer's struggle went viral after a series of stories appeared online documenting the man's efforts to raise money for a costly and dangerous surgery to remove the growth on his scrotum.

The publicity allowed the 39-year-old Michigan man to raise close to $30,000 towards the operation, which was performed Thursday in California.

'With any surgery, there’s a chance of something going wrong. So, there is fear. Then, there’s the excitement of changing my life forever,' Maurer told The Detroit Free Press on the eve of the procedure.

Hours before the operation, Maurer took to his GoFundMe page to post an update about the upcoming operation. 

'My Surgery is in 2 hours. So this might be my last post. I love you all and I can not thank you enough for your support in all of this,' he wrote.

Nervous and excited: Maurer said before the surgery that he was looking forward to having sex with his wife, Mindy (left), for the first time in seven years

'My wife is everything to me and to get a second chance to give her then man she deserves means a lot to me. I will post as soon as I can if andwhen I wake up.'

Speaking to New York Daily News before going under the knife, Mr Maurer reiterated that he was anxious, but that the risk was well worth it.

'With the surgery, my life is on the line and losing my penis is on the line,' he said.

The Michigan resident added that he was excited about the prospect of having sex with his wife for the first time in seven years.

Beside marital relations, Maurer is also looking forward to doing more traveling and riding a jet ski.

Maurer, originally from Kalamazoo, first noticed that something was wrong with his anatomy when he was in his 20s.

Maurer's scrotum started getting bigger, but when he sought medical help, doctors informed him that he has to lose weight.

‘I was doing two miles a day in the pool, so I lost 50lbs like that,’ said Dan.

But even as he was shedding the extra pounds, his scrotum continued expanding, eventually ballooning to the size of a large cantaloupe. 

‘The bigger it gets it seems to me like the faster it grows. When he stands it almost hangs to his ankles,’ his mother, Connie Maurer, told My Fox Detroit.

Dan Maurer again consulted with physicians but got the same response as before: he must lose more weight.

Setback: Maurer was able to shed 50lbs through daily exercise, but his scrotum continued growing

‘As far as they were concerned, I had to have lap-band surgery to lose weight,’ Dan told the station KSDK.

Maurer eventually fell ill and had to be hospitalized with what turned out to be a broken cyst inside his oversize scrotum.

Then one day, Dan Maurer came across the TLC reality show The Man With The 132 Pound Scrotum about the plight of Wesley Warren Jr.

At that moment, Maurer knew what was wrong with him.

Scrotal lymphedema is a disease that is caused by blockage of the lymphatic vessels in which tissue builds up outside of the testicles, resulting in swelling.

Maurer then discovered that his only hope was Dr Joel Gelman, a California-based urologist who operated on Wesley Warren in April 2013 to remove his outsized growth.

Last hope: Dr Joel Gelman (left), who also treated Wesley Warren, has agreed to operate on Dan Maurer (right), but the $20,000 surgery is not covered by his insurance 

Warren passed away in March of this year at age 49. It is believed that he died from complications with diabetes. 

Gelman has agreed to perform the dangerous operation to remove Maurer's massive growth, but the urologist is not in the patient's medical network and the procedure is not covered by his insurance.

In the case of Wesley Warren, Dr Gelman agreed to treat him free of charge.

Dan Maurer has launched a campaign on the site GoFundMe.com to raise $20,000 toward the surgery. As of Thursday afternoon, people have donated over $27,200.
