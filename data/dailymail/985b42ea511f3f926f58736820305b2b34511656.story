It is the latest in the 'poopertrator' saga that has left Yale college students bewildered and angry.

Berkley students were woken in the early hours of this morning to find a laundry line of soiled T-shirts, pants and towels hung across campus.

Not only that, but at 3.35am students received an anonymous email from the alleged 'poopertrator' to inform them of his latest 'masterpiece'.

Students at Berkley, which is one of Yales' residential colleges, received the email from 'Copro Philiac' which said: 'Last time, I promise.'

Dirty laundry: Ivy League it may be, but someone at Yale University is causing a stink

It was signed 'Forever yours, YP' and
included three photographs of the items of clothing with what looked 
like feces smeared over them, the Yale Daily News reports.

In a 10:32am follow-up email, the 
anonymous 'poopetrator' sent another photograph of the line of soiled 
clothes with the comment: 'It’s still a good morning!'

News of the 'poopertrator' made 
headlines earlier this week after someone at Saybrook residential 
college had been urinating into washing machines and even dropping their 
feces in.

The matter was brought to campus 
officials' attention after a student brought physical evidence of the 
crime to the Saybrook Master Paul Hudak's office.

According to the Yale Daily News,
the pooper has been on the loose since early September, but it wasn't 
until student Lucy Fleming showed the evidence - her soiled laundry - to
college authorities that Yale police joined the search.

They have not yet commented about the line of dirty clothes.

On September 7, Fleming went to Saybrook's laundry room to collect her clean washing from a dryer after it had already been urinated in the laundry earlier in the day.

She had rewashed the clothes, but when she removed her clothing from the dryer she realized that they were covered in feces.

'I simultaneously wanted to throw up, cry and punch someone,' Fleming told the Yale Daily News.

The serial-pooper quickly became the talk of Twitter, with students dubbing the trending scandal #poopgate2k13.

It seems that while not engaged in intellectual pursuits, a person, almost certainly a Yale student, had been throwing food and urine into dryers for some weeks before Fleming's dryer discovery.

The recent escalation to fecal matter has college residents watching their clothing for the entire dryer cycle, and some campus colleges fear a spate of copy-cat laundry poopers.

Some students, however, are unconcerned about the nefarious laundry-soiler and 'Dirty Laundry' parties have been thrown around the university.

Exclusive: Yale is one of the nation's most sought-after colleges

And others have taken a more academic approach to the issue.

'Leave it to YDN, Yale PD, and
the Yale administration to miss a work of art, even when it hits them 
like a stinking pile of s**t. This is clearly an act of the avant-garde, not a criminal mind,' wrote a commenter on Yale Daily News, only identifying themselves as 'AnAlumnus'.

'Defying bourgeoisie standards of etiquette, and destabilizing the 
hegemonic "clean/dirty" binary (which itself is underpinned and 
constructed by hidden economic, racial, and gender ideologies) our 
intrepid defecator (though perhaps we cannot assume that the artist 
recycled his or her own byproduct) juxtaposes the filthy with the 
sanitary, making the thought-provoking suggestion that we are all full 
of it, always and at all times, even at our most pristine,' wrote the former student and consummate stirrer.

According to the Yale Daily News, there have been at least four separate incidents involving human feces in the Saybrook laundry.

'We have asked our students not to leave their laundry unattended, the affected machines have been thoroughly disinfected, and we are actively seeking information about who the perpetrator might be,' Hudak told the News.

Hudak also sent an email addressing the matter to students:

'Dear Saybrugians,' he wrote.

'Someone has been doing weird, creepy, and (frankly) disgusting things in the Laundry Room. This must stop immediately. If you have observed something of this nature, or know who the perpetrator might be, please let me know. I can’t imagine why someone would do these things, but it has got to stop, and we will take measures to be sure it does.'

Student Camille Fonseca told the Yale Daily News that students have been standing watch over the dryers to ensure their clothes don't get ruined, and that many students think the college should employ 24-hour security guards in the laundry.

'It’s ruining people’s quality of life,' she said.

The search continues for the Yale poopertrator - and when he or she is found, the poop will surely hit the fan.
