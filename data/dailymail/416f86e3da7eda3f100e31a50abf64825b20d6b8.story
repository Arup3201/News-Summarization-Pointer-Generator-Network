When Misha Grimes took home the crown at a beauty pageant her mother Kasha was not cheering her on from the sidelines but from the same catwalk. 

Kasha, 53, recently made her debut in pageanting after being inspired by her 16-year-old daughter, Misha, to take up the contests.

And the pair proved that they shared good genes after Misha finished as second runner-up at Miss Teen Galaxy UK and Kasha as first runner-up at Mrs Galaxy UK - both on February 7.

Misha has competed in pageants since she was 13 years old and proud mum Kasha followed in her footsteps by being named as first runner-up in the Mrs Galaxy UK event this month.

Misha, from Cotswolds, says that she fell into the pageanting scene as a bit of fun and never expected it to turn into such a full-time hobby.

'I entered my first competition on a whim - it was totally unplanned and I've been hooked ever since.

'I was competing against some girls that were five years older than me which was very daunting but they were all very supportive.'

Misha started competing in pageants three years ago and encouraged her mum to join her this year after the pair were constantly mistaken for sisters despite her Kasha being 53 years old 

Misha added that her mum has always been close to the point where they are mistaken for siblings. 

'My mum has always been there for me and it's amazing how often we get told that we look like sisters.

'We always get funny looks when we tell people we're actually mum and daughter.'

Misha says that her mother has always supported her but finally decided to take on the catwalk after being inspired by another older contestant.  

'The current title holder of Mrs Galaxy Europe inspired my mum to do the pageant and after cheering me on over the years she wanted to join in and see what it was all about.

'She did fantastically in her first event both on stage and off stage.

'It's safe to say that if I look anything like my mum does when I'm her age then I'll be over the moon.'

Misha, who lives with her dad, John, sister, Anya, 18, and her mum, has competed in four pageants to date and aspires to become Miss Universe Great Britain.

Kasha says that she hopes to changed negative perceptions that often come with pageanting

On her pageant debut, Misha scooped third spot in the Miss Teen GB event in 2012 and has gone on to compete at Junior Teen GB, and twice at Miss Teen Galaxy England, coming in top three every time.

She encouraged her mum to get involved and over the last three years the pair have raised a whopping £11,000 for charities including Christie's and Claire House Children's Hospice.

Kasha, a holiday rental business owner, said competing has given her a new lease of life.

'Misha competed for the first time three years ago and I've always been very supportive of her,' she said.

'She's been very much an inspiration to me because I've seen how it has changed her life and given here a huge confidence boost.'

Kasha added that although at first she was in two minds about entering a beauty contest she has no regrets an thoroughly enjoys pageanting.

Misha has placed in the top three for every beauty contest she has entered since she was 13

'I reluctantly decided to sign up and it's turned out to be one of the best decisions of my life - the support I've had has been amazing.

'I was the oldest person competing at Mrs Galaxy UK - a lot of the other competitors were in their 20s.

'But I worked incredibly hard in preparing for the event and ended up doing very well by finishing as first runner-up.'

The mother-of-two said that by competing she hopes to to dissuade certain stereotypes that often come beauty pageants.  

Kasha says that attending the contests as mother and daughter has bought them even closer together 

'I was desperate to change society's perception of pageants - they do so much good work that goes unnoticed.

'The whole experience has taught me how to be more graceful, confident and compassionate by allowing me to advance my personal and career goals whist acting as a role model within community.

'It's given me a new lease of life - I feel alive again.'

Kasha says that not only has competing given her a confidence boost it has even improved the family's relationship. 

'Along with my other daughter, Anya, Misha is my best friend.

'Joining the pageants has really changed us as a family as well - we've always been close but this has brought us even closer together.'
