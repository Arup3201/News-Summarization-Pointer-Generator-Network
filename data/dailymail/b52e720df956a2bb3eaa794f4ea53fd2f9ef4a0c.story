A Japanese politician who sparked an international row after claiming the use of sex slaves during WWII was justified has tried to shift the blame by accusing other country's of using the same practice. 

Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto, co-leader of an emerging nationalist party, argued Japan's wartime practice of forcing Asian women into prostitution was necessary to maintain military discipline and provide relaxation for soldiers.

But following the public outcry over his comments, the mayor has attempted to deflect criticism by accusing America and Britain of using sex slaves for its own soldiers.

He said: 'It is a hard truth that even these nations used local women for sexual reasons. This is a historical fact and there is hard evidence that proves it was true.'

Historians say up to 200,000 women, 
mainly from the Korean Peninsula and China, were forced to provide sex 
for Japanese soldiers in military brothels. While some other World War 
II armies had military brothels, Japan is the only country accused of 
such widespread, organized sexual slavery.

Hashimoto, a lawyer and former TV 
personality, created an uproar with comments to journalists two weeks 
ago about Japan's modern and wartime sexual services, which he said were
 misquoted.

He is reported to have said: 'To maintain discipline in the military, it must have been necessary at that time.

'For
 soldiers who risked their lives in circumstances where bullets are 
flying around like rain and wind, if you want them to get some rest, a 
comfort women system was necessary. That’s clear to anyone.'

He added that on a recent visit to the 
southern island of Okinawa, he suggested to the U.S. commander there 
that his troops 'make better use' of the legal sex industry 'to control 
the sexual energy of those tough guys.'

Hashimoto has since claimed he had not tried to 
condone a system of so-called comfort women, but meant to say military 
authorities at the time, not only in Japan but in many other countries, 
considered it necessary.

'Comfort woman' is a translation of 
the Japanese euphemism, jugun ianfu, (military comfort women), referring
 to women of various ethnic and national backgrounds and social 
circumstances who became sex slaves for the Japanese troops before and 
during World War Two.

Forgotten women: Hashimoto failed to mention the Chinese, Filipino, and Indonesian women also exploited as sex slaves during World War II. Above, Filipino former-comfort women march in 2004 to protest their wartime abuse

Hashimoto also claims singling out Japan is wrong, alleging the issue also existed in the armed forces of the United States, 
Britain, France, Germany and the former Soviet Union during World War 
II.

'Based on the premise that Japan must 
remorsefully face its past offenses and must never justify the offenses,
 I intended to argue that other nations in the world must not attempt to
 conclude the matter by blaming only Japan and by associating Japan 
alone with the simple phrase of "sex slaves" or "sex slavery",' 
Hashimoto said in a statement to journalists.

But the mayor did apologise to for saying U.S. troops should patronize adult entertainment businesses as a way to reduce sex crimes.

Hashimoto's suggestion to the U.S. 
troops brought sharp criticism from Washington. The State Department 
called Hashimoto's comments 'outrageous and offensive.

Sense of crisis: Hashimoto made the comments because of a 'sense of crisis' over sex crimes committed by U.S. soldiers stationed in Okinawa, where there has been a U.S. military presence ever since World War II

Okinawa
 was invaded by U.S. forces in World War II and has had an American 
military presence since.

The 1995 rape of a schoolgirl by two Marines 
and a sailor spread rage across the island, and more rapes and other 
crimes linked to U.S. servicemen over the years, along with military 
land use and aircraft noise, have caused longstanding anti-U.S. military
 sentiment there.

Hashimoto said his remarks rose from a 'sense of crisis' about the cases of sexual assaults by U.S. military personnel on Japanese civilians in Okinawa, where a large number of U.S. troops are based under a bilateral security treaty.

'I understand that my remark could be 
construed as an insult to the U.S. forces and to the American people' 
and was inappropriate, he told a news conference at the Foreign 
Correspondents' Club of Japan in Tokyo. 'I retract this remark and 
express an apology.'

'Comfort woman' is a translation of 
the Japanese euphemism, jugun ianfu, (military comfort women), referring
 to women of various ethnic and national backgrounds and social 
circumstances who became sex slaves for the Japanese troops before and 
during World War Two.

Military brothels existed across the Asia Pacific region in areas occupied by the Japanese forces.

There
 is no way to determine precisely how many women were forced to serve as
 comfort women, but estimates range from 80,000 to 200,000, of whom 
about 80 per cent of whom are thought to have been Korean.

Some of the girls forced into sexual slavery were as young as 12 years old, according to Chinese legal groups.

An 'inexcusable act': Historians estimate that the Japanese military forced up to 200,000 women to act as prostitutes during World War II

Japanese
 women and women of other occupied territories (such as Taiwan, the 
Philippines, Indonesia, Burma and the Pacific islands) were also used as
 comfort women, according to a report by San Francisco State University.

The authorities believed the comfort 
system would enhance the morale of the military and help prevent 
soldiers from committing sexual violence toward women of occupied 
territories, which became a real concern after the infamous Nanjing 
Massacre in 1937.

They 
were also concerned with the health of the troops, which prompted close 
supervision of the hygienic conditions in the comfort stations to help 
keep STDs under control.

When
 the war ended, the only military tribunal concerning the sexual abuse 
of comfort women took place in Batavia (now Jakarta, the capital of 
Indonesia) in 1948.

Several
 Japanese military officers were convicted for having forced the 35 
Dutch women involved in the case into comfort stations.

The issue began to emerge in Korea only in the late 1980s.

The
 Japanese government admitted deception, coercion and official 
involvement in the recruitment of comfort women in August 1993, but 
critics said they needed to go much further.

After
 Japan's surrender it is reported that it set up a similar system there 
for American GIs, with tacit approval from U.S. authorities,

Japanese
 officials visited a New Jersey town in April 2012 to ask for a memorial
 to the thousands of Korean women and girls who were enslaved to be 
removed.
