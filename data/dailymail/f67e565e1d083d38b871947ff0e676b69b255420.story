Busted: Metropolitan Airports Commission spokesman Patrick Hogan says Jarrett was taken into custody at around 12:30 pm

Fox News anchor Gregg Jarrett has been released after his arrest at a Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport bar for refusing to cooperate with airport police who were called to the scene, an airport official said.

Jarrett was taken into custody at around 12.30pm Wednesday at the Northern Lights Grill in the airport's main terminal.

He remained in Hennepin County Jail until around 1:30 a.m. Thursday.

Officers were called to the scene after reports of an intoxicated man.

They arrived to find Jarrett drunk and said he acted belligerent and refused to follow orders, according to Metropolitan Airports Commission spokesman Patrick Hogan.

Jarrett, 
59, was booked on a preliminary charge of 
obstructing the legal process by interfering with a peace officer, which is a misdemeanor.

His 
bond was set at $300. Records show he's due in court on June 6.

A representative of Fox News issued a statement Thursday morning about the arrest at the airport bar. The bar is shown below in a picture supplied by RSP Architects.

'We were made aware late last night that Gregg Jarrett was arrested in Minneapolis yesterday and charged with a misdemeanor,' the network spokesperson said. 'He is dealing with serious personal issues at this time. A date at which Gregg might return to air has yet to be determined.'

On May 12, Jarrett, who has two daughters with wife Catherine Kennedy Anderson, requested time off from Fox News for 'personal reasons,' according to TV Newser, and the network granted his request.

Jarrett recently covered the murder trial of George Zimmerman and the crash of Asiana Flight 214 at the San Francisco Airport.

The Los Angeles-born broadcaster joined the Fox News Channel in November 2002.

He attracted attention on April 14 after appearing intoxicated on the air and slurring his speech during a broadcast segment about the IRS tea-party targeting scandal.

Forty minutes into a dinnertime broadcast, he left the show and didn't return.
