Manchester City showed their eagle-eyed ambition on Wednesday night by progressing to the last 16 of the Champions League and Manuel Pellegrini's side were all smiles as they trained in Rome on Thursday ahead of their flight back to England.

Goals from Samir Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta saw the Premier League champions seal a 2-0 win away at Roma - a result that saw them qualify as Group E runners-up at the expense of their opponents.

The importance of the Stadio Olimpico scoreline means City will now enter the knockout stages of the Europe's elite competition for only the second time in their history; a feat that they were clearly proud of as they trained at Lazio's Formello facilities - the base of Roma's arch-rivals.

Thursday's training session would have been doubly refreshing for City left back Aleksandar Kolarov as he returned to the home of his former club.

The 29-year-old, who enjoyed three seasons at Lazio before joining the Etihad outfit in 2010, took a trip down memory lane as he basked in a team photo - including the Serb - of the Italian side celebrating their 2009 Supercoppa Italiana triumph against Inter.

Assistant manager Brian Kidd also appeared in a relaxed manner during the session as he even got to hold Lazio's match-day mascot Olimpia - the American golden eagle.

And while City are flying high at present, the players were back to business as stars including Joe Hart, David Silva and James Milner were put through their paces ahead of Saturday's Premier League trip to Leicester.

Speaking after their victory over Roma; Hart, who was captain for the evening in Vincent Kompany's absence, is adamant that the team are going from strength-to-strength.

'We never wrote ourselves off, we're a strong unit,' he told Sky Sports. 'We believed in ourselves, we had a bit of a slow start but you don’t win the Premier League easily and we've done it twice in three years.

'We've got resolve, we've got character and we've got fantastic players - add that all together and we've got a chance.

'It's been a great performance, we are moving in the right direction. That's five or six games on the spin now that we've really stepped it up.

'We've been together for a long time and there's no international breaks about to disrupt what we're trying to do. We are going into December - Vinny's (Kompany) is going to be fit, the Wizard (Silva) is back - we are starting to get our players back and the squad is strong.'

Milner, who also played the duration of the game on Wednesday, echoed Hart's sentiments believing City can enjoy a long run in the Champions League.

'We will take it step by step but I definitely think the quality is there to go far in this competition,' he added.

'We don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but the more seasons we play in the Champions League, and the more games we play in it, the experience helps and we get better as a team.'
