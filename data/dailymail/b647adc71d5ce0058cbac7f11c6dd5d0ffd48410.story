On Wednesday, Abbott returned to the SCG for a team counselling session and was supported by colleagues and team officials who have been concerned.  

And on Thursday afternoon he visited Hughes in hospital and was met warmly by his own team-mates, friends of Hughes and cricket greats such as Steve Waugh.

Looking pale and exhausted, Abbott arrived at St Vincent's wearing a black baseball hat at 2.30pm local time.  

All NSW and South Australian players are receiving counselling and psychological support in the wake of the incident.

The Australian Cricketers' Association said it was monitoring Abbott closely. It was reported he was struggling as a host of former Australian pace greats jumped to his support.

'[Abbott] has got a lot of support around him from his team-mates and also the counselling services,' ACA CEO Alistair Nicholson said.

'He's someone who we're monitoring closely and we know he's got a lot of support around him.'
