Arrest: Robert Kaiser, 32, claimed he fell while holding his son, who later died of a brain injury

A dad has been accused of fatally shaking his two-month-old son after the boy kept him awake.

Robert J. Kaiser, 32, has been charged with second-degree unintentional murder after the death of the baby was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner.

Kaiser, the baby's primary caregiver, had been looking after the boy at his home in Farming Township, Minnesota on August 27 while the baby's mother was away for the day.

He texted her at one point to say that the baby was keeping him awake, she told police.

When she returned to the house, she noticed that the boy 'seemed different'. He was taken to  Albany Hospital before he was taken by air ambulance to a hospital in the Twin Cities, the Star Tribune reported.

The boy had suffered a traumatic brain injury and later passed away.

An autopsy on the baby revealed that he also had healing broken ribs, as well as other injuries that could have been the result of abuse.

When authorities questioned Kaiser about what had happened, he explained that he had fallen over while holding the boy and re-enacted the fall on video.

Accused: Kaiser, pictured in images from Facebook, had texted the baby's mother earlier that day to say the baby was keeping him up while he tried to sleep. When she returned, the baby didn't seem well

But when a child abuse expert watched the video, he advised that the boy's injury did not match up with Kaiser's version. 

'The medical findings suggest that the mechanism for [the boy’s] injury was shaking,' the criminal said.

Kaiser, who is unemployed, was charged with second-degree murder on Friday, a week after the boy's death.  

He remains jailed in lieu of $500,000 bail.
