Accused pervert: Mauel Leyva, 19, stands charged with soliciting minors for sex and possessing child pornography

A high school football coach has been jailed on $1million bail after being accused of soliciting minors for sex and possessing child pornography.

Manuel Leyva, 19, of Moreno Valley, CA., is known to have targeted students in the Moreno Valley School District – where he graduated from and was an assistant coach – during the past two school years, police said.

The accused pedophile used social media to accost the objects of his desire, but is not known to have ever sexually assaulted students, sources told KCAL.

Police say none of the crimes happened on school property, but did occur during his employment with the district. He has since been fired.

Students told the station the supposed pervert often hung around campus and posed as a woman online to meet underage students.

Authorities have not revealed the gender of the students he is charged with soliciting for sex.

One such solicitation was confirmed, police told Banning-Beaumont Patch, but officials believe more victims will come forward.

An investigation revealed Mr Leyva had child pornography in his possession, cops said.

Hunting ground: Mr Leyva often hung around campus at Moreno Valley high School and would then target underage students through social media, students and police said

Mr Leyva turned himself in Friday at Moreno Valley High School and was hit with multiple felony sex charges including solicitation of a minor and possessing child pornography, authorities said.

His bail has been set at $1million and officials are urging other victims to come forward.
