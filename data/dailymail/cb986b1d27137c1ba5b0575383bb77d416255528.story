Concerns: A previously hidden email from NHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh criticised 'persistently high' death rates in Welsh hospitals

Labour has been accused of trying to cover up warnings over high death rates and lengthy waiting times at hospitals in Wales.

An email written by Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director in England, said mortality rates at six sites were ‘persistently high’ and criticised ‘worrying’ waits for cancer tests.

But it has emerged that officials in the devolved government tried to suppress the message’s release because the information it contained would ‘prejudice the conduct of public affairs’.

Sir Bruce’s email to Dr Chris Jones, his counterpart in Wales, was only uncovered when it was released under Freedom of Information laws.

An email sent by the director of corporate and legal services at the Welsh Government, Joanna Jordan, to NHS England, argues that there is a risk the two medical directors might be too scared to communicate with each other in future.

The details were uncovered by Conservative MP Charlotte Leslie – again using Freedom of Information laws – who accused the devolved Labour Government in Wales of being ‘committed to cover-ups.’

‘If it was not for Sir Bruce Keogh, this evidence of potentially fatal diagnostic waiting times, and high mortality rates would probably have been hidden from the public and the welsh people, to protect political careers and pensions.’

In her email sent to NHS England in February – days before the information was released – Joanna Jordan argues that it should not be made public because the medical directors need ‘a safe space.’

It adds: ‘Disclosure of the records of these conversations would likely undermine this safe space, and would severely limit the ability of Medical directors in England and the devolved administrations raising and work through sensitive and complex issues together.

She says the email is a follow-up to an earlier phone-call to NHS England – presumably trying to block the release of information – and adds that Wales’ First Minister, Carwyn Jones, ‘is very likely to support our approach.’

Yet despite Sir Bruce’s warning email five months ago, the Welsh NHS have still failed to investigate death rates and waiting times.

Miss Leslie, who sits on the health select committee added: ‘This all reeks of the fatal cover-ups at Mid Staffs. The Labour party say they have learned lessons from the Mid Staffs scandal.

'If they have, for the sake of Welsh patients, I would make a plea to Andy Burnham to prevail upon his Welsh Labour colleagues to make them agree to conduct a Bruce-Keogh style review of safety in the Welsh NHS.

'Likely support': A government lawyer implied that First Minister Carwyn Jones supported the email being suppressed

‘The time for attacking the messenger is over, we need urgent action. Lives could be at stake.’

The situation in Wales has prompted thousands of patients to cross the border to English hospitals in the hope of better treatment and shorter waits. 

Concerns have also been raised by Labour MP Ann Clwyd who emotionally revealed the shocking care of her husband Owen in 2012 at one of those hospitals with high death rates, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff.

Latest figures show that 15 out of the 18 district general hospitals in Wales have higher than average mortality rates.

David Davies, Tory MP for Monmouth, South Wales, said: ‘This smacks of a cover-up. I’m hugely concerned by the plummeting standards of care in Wales.

‘People are queuing up to get out of the Welsh system to come to England because they are worried about the lack of care and much longer waits. Now it seems the Assembly is deliberately trying to cover up the very serious concerns.

‘What’s happening in Wales should serve as a warning sign to anyone thinking of voting Labour in the next general election. The NHS cannot be trusted in their hands.’

Deadly: The University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff is one of those with high death rates

Welsh Assembly Member Darren Millar, the Shadow Health Minister in Wales, said, ‘The Labour ministers in the Welsh Government have been caught red handed trying to cover up concerns from England’s most senior clinician about high death rates in Welsh hospitals and excessively long waiting times.

‘The 2013 data shows that every hospital
 in Wales, bar three, has a death rate above the England and Wales 
average yet Labour Ministers wanted to keep it all hush-hush to avoid 
criticism and refused to take advice and investigate - it’s a disgrace.

A Welsh Government spokesman said: 'These emails have been in the public domain for three months.

'This letter was sent as part of the normal process of considering an FOI request.

'The Welsh NHS is open and transparent - our diagnostic waiting times are published every month and mortality rates are published every quarter.'

‘If anywhere else in the UK had death rates as high as some of those in Wales, there would have been a Mid Staffs-style investigation by now, but Labour are shamefully covering up their own failure for narrow party political reasons.’

‘The Welsh NHS is on its knees, reeling from Labour’s record-breaking cuts, closures and cancellations. Patients deserve better.’

Unlike the NHS in England, whose budget has been protected from public spending cuts, the Welsh Government have slashed theirs by eight per cent since 2009.

In addition, Welsh Labour health ministers rejected Tony Blair’s target regime and allow private sector firms to carry out some NHS treatment which have both been credited with bringing down waiting times.

Figures show that almost 50 per cent of patients wait six weeks or more for vital scans and tests to diagnose cancer compared with a 1 per cent figure in England.

And Wales refused to implement a National Cancer Drugs Fund, which pays for treatments rejected by the NHS or awaiting approval, meaning many patients are denied life-saving drugs they can get in England.
