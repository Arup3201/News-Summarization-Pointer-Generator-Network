Andy Murray admits it will be a relief to defend his Wimbledon title without the same pressure that had followed him throughout his career before last year's victory.

The Scot ended a 77-year wait for a British champion by defeating Novak Djokovic in last year's final and returns to the Championships without wearing that albatross around his neck for the first time.

'It builds to a point where last year was by far the most extreme pressure I’d felt in my career. It’s nice not to worry about it now,' Murray told the Evening Standard.

Since banishing the ghosts of Fred Perry last summer, Murray has struggled on tour as a consequence of two defining events - splitting with coach Ivan Lendl and undergoing crucial back surgery.

Murray had an operation in September to resolve an issue with his back that had been troubling him for years, and is starting to feel the benefits.

'I was having to change the way I was training to try to deal with the back and it just got to a point where I was like ‘I’m tired of this’.

'I feel better now than I did, not so much endurance wise but in terms of the shots I can play without being in pain,' he says.

However, while the physical scars of his operation are starting to heal, the British No 1 is still recovering from the emotional turmoil of ending his relationship with Lendl in March.

'It was like a double blow, it was a real setback for sure but only for a few weeks and then it’s time to move on.

'I spent a couple of great years with him but it’s time to try to move on.'

Murray has since become the first high profile player to take on a female coach after agreeing to work with Former World No 1 Amelie Mauresmo at SW19.

'Ivan’s game was very consistent, high percentage, very solid, no weaknesses, he just did everything, well, great. Amelie played with more variety and flair, came to the net more, did more top spin,' he said.

'That’s more my sort of style so it might be a bit easier for her to explain those things to me and help me work on my strengths a bit more.'

Best defence: Andy Murray can count on previous experience when he tries to repeat history at SW19

Murray, who has been seeded third, has been handed a favourable draw and will face Belgian David Goffin in the first round.

He admits that successfully defending his crown will be challenging, but at least he can count on previous experience.

'Is it easier to win it a first time or defend it? I don’t know. What I do now is how tough it is to win Wimbledon.'
