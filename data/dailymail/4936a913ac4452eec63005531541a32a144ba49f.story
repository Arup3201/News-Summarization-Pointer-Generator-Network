A player went down to the ice with a six-inch gash in his leg during a minor league hockey game, forcing medical staff to improvise with the materials on hand to save his life.

Huntsville Havoc center Justin Cseter went down to the ice during the second period with blood spurting from a gash on his leg, causing the entire Peoria arena to fall silent.

The Peoria Star Journal reports that Rivermen forward Dennis Sicard had accidentally fallen on Cseter, slicing six inches of unprotected skin with his skate and leaving a one-and-a-half inch deep wound.

Stuck: Medics fashioned a tourniquet from a hockey stick to keep Huntsville Havor center Justin Cseter from bleeding out during a game in Peoria

Almost immediately, trainers from both Huntsville and Peoria were shuffling across the ice, trying to reach Cseter and keep him from losing too much blood. 

Rivermen goaltender Eric Levine rushed over with towels to press to the wound to staunch the bleeding as Havoc winger Corey Bellamy knelt over Cseter and talked to him to keep him alert.

A doctor at Cseter's side asked a player to break a hockey stick in half before using it to wrap a tourniquet around his thigh as an EMT brought over an IV.

'Cseter was pretty calm, really,' Levine said. 'He was asking a lot of questions, wanted to know what was happening to him, he said "Let's all be on the same page here guys."'

The skate had cut into muscle, but missed the artery. A fan collapsed during the commotion and the blood was still thick on the ice when doctors finally wheeled Cseter off a half hour later.

The head coaches of both teams convened a conference call with the president of the Southern Professional Hockey League, Jim Combs, who gave the okay to suspend the game.

Family: According to the Star Journal, Cseter's father (left) and mother (right), along with his grandparents, had to watch their son fight for his life

Alert: Cseter raised his hand to the crowd as he was being wheeled off to show them he was alright after he was treated

'You realize what things are important when something like this happens,' Huntsville coach Glenn Detulleo said. 'We were all pretty shaken up about it. It was horrible.' 

'I've seen wrists slashed. But this is only the second time I've ever seen something this bad with my own eyes,' said Peoria coach Jean-Guy Trudel. 'I don't think it would have been fair to put players in the position of having to go back out there after what happened.'

The team reported that Cseter was released later from the hospital and boarded a bus for the nine-hour trip back to Huntsville.
