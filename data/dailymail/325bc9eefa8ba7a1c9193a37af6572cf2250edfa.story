Andrej Kramaric's father has confirmed Chelsea's interest in the Croatian striker but suggests moving to Stamford Bridge might not be the best move for his son. 

The 23-year-old frontman has drawn admiring glances from the current Premier League leaders after scoring 21 goals in just 19 appearances for Croatian side Rijeka.

However, Kramaric's father Josip, is concerned his son would be sent out on loan while facing an uncertain future at Stamford Bridge.

Speaking to T Portal, he said : 'They [Chelsea] are really persistent. The thing we disagree over is Andrej's loan over the next six months. The question is where would he go on loan? We have no guarantee that he would return to Chelsea when the loan ends.

'The financial conditions wouldn't be the same if Kramaric is with the Chelsea first team or somewhere on loan. True, it's a great club, but I'm not sure if it's the right way to go.'

At the start of September Chelsea had 26 youngsters and fringe players out on loan at clubs around the world.

Were Kramaric to join Jose Mourinho's side during the January transfer window, the attacker would face competition from Diego Costa, Didier Drogba and Loic Remy for a place in the Chelsea first-team.
