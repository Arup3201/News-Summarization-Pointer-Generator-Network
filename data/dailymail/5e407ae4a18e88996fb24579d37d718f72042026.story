A judge has handed down a five-year prison term to a man accused in the death of a central Ohio child-rape suspect who died after a jail assault.

Defendant Zachary Butler also was fined $1,500 on Wednesday and ordered to serve three years' probation after prison.

A report by the Champaign County Sheriff's Office says inmate David Piersol was beaten on April 5 at Tri-County Regional Jail in Mechanicsburg and died a few days later. Piersol was in jail after being charged with allegedly raping a young girl.

Butler, of Richwood, took responsibility for the assault and apologized to Piersol's family. But he also suggested other inmates continued to attack Piersol in a jail bathroom afterward. 

Sentenced: Zachary Butler pleaded guilty last month to one count of reckless homicide and one count of tampering with evidence and will serve a five year prison term 

 Defendant Zachary Butler, of Richwood, pleaded guilty last month to one count of reckless homicide and one count of tampering with evidence. 

The tampering charge involves an accusation that the 24-year-old Butler traded blood-stained pants with another inmate, according to Champaign County prosecutor Kevin Talebi.

While Butler's family has said other inmates forced him to attack Piersol, Talebi says no other charges are expected.

Butler was in the Mechanicsburg jail at the time on charges of resisting arrest and drunken driving.

Piersol was in jail on a rape charge stemming from allegations involving abuse of a young girl last fall, according to Marysville Police Department records.

A message was left with Piersol's attorney.
