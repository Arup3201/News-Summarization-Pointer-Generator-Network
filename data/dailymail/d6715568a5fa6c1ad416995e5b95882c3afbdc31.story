Hayley Hasselhoff has walked in plus-size fashion week and is a mouthpiece for the industry - and it seems that someone's been paying attention.

Hayley, the 21-year-old daughter of David Hasselhoff, has been snapped up by Yours Clothing to serve as the face of its summer range.

Speaking about landing the role, size 16 Hayley said: 'I absolutely 
adore Yours Clothing and the message behind their brand.

'To have been 
asked to model their range for the summer, including their swimwear, was
 an offer I couldn't refuse.'

Yours Clothing, which offers 
garments in sizes 14-32, was thrilled to snap up Hayley, especially 
considering that she's the face of British Plus-Size Fashion Week.

The founder of the clothing brand, which is priced between £8-£35, said: 'It has been a joy to 
work with Hayley as the face of our summer collection.

'She is such a 
great advocate for the plus size market and she looks fantastic in the 
range.'

Perfect fit: The plus-size clothing brand are thrilled to have Hayley, who is the ambassador for British Plus-Size Fashion Week, on board

Industry stalwart: Hayley has been modelling since she was 14 years old and was the ambassador for Plus-Size Fashion Week in Paris, walking in numerous shows

Miss Hasselhoff, who played Amber in the ABC Family original series Huge, recently told The Huffington Post that ‘at the end of the day [plus-size] just means “curvy.”’

She
 feels that the word ‘plus-size in the [fashion] industry is very 
different from people’s mind view of what plus-size really should mean.’

Hayley, who 
started modelling at the age of 14, is well aware of the challenges 
facing women of larger sizes when they go shopping.

She
 says that she hopes her work as a model will help change the fashion 
design landscape and appropriate larger sizes as equally fashionable to 
smaller ones. 

‘What we're doing is showing 
different body shapes and sizes so that you can feel confident with any 
shape or size that you are,’ she said.

Campaigner: Hayley feels that the word 'plus-size in the industry is very different from people's mind view of what plus-size really should mean - and now she hopes to change that

The young model added that ‘fashion can always be a part of your life no 
matter what shape or size you are. You don’t need to feel like you have 
to fit into a box because you aren't a certain size that your favorite 
designer carries.’

The seasoned poser broke onto the 
scene with a contract at Ford Models, which helped her gain contracts 
with retailers including Torrid.

She was the ambassador for Paris’s Plus-Size 
Fashion Weekend, where walked in multiple runway shows.

She hopes events like these will help change the modelling industry as well.

‘When it comes to the runway, who knows what's going to happen in a year or 10 years?’ she pondered.
