A group of British ex-pats are this morning in court after being arrested in a dramatic raid police on a bar in Portugal.

Officers swooped on the Yorkshire Tavern, in the resort of Albufeira, for breaching the country's strict gambling laws.

But the major sting operation was not closing the net on a high-level, international gang of criminals, running a multi-million-euro gambling ring.

Instead, it was the sedate game of bingo.

Undercover detectives, who had staked out their target for two weeks, sprung their trap moments after the prizes - a tin of biscuits and a bar of chocolate - were given out.

The bar was full of British holidaymakers, aged from 23 to 76 who were taken away to a police station and questioned for four hours.

Pub landlady Marianne Pittaway, 34, told the Sun: 'They rounded us all up like a bunch of gangsters at about 11pm. It was 3am by the time they let us all go.'

The mother-of-one, originally from York, is among the group this morning up before a Portuguese court for further questioning over allegations they failed to apply for a government licence to hold the bingo game. If found guilty, they face a fine of between £1,300 and £8,500.

A post on the pub's Facebook page 
read: 'While we do not disagree that bingo is a form of gambling, The 
Portuguese bars can & do have raffles without a problem.

'Some
even charge €10 to take part in a poker game, the prize is a pig 
(live). Others advertise on local radio. Just so you know. Must go to 
bed now as court at 9am.'

But
they managed to see the funny side of their predicament, adding in 
another post: 'Never a dull moment, free transport to the local nick 
included in your night out. See the Algarve by night, conducted tour by 
uniformed guides.

The almost farcical drama unfolded on
Friday evening, a few seconds after 74-year-old Gerald Platt, from 
Bicester, Oxfordshire, picked up his prize.

The
plain-clothed detectives told him to write his name on the back of the 
bingo card, which was then placed in a sealed, evidence bag.

Police confiscated his biscuits, but he says he managed to hide the chocolate. Officers rounded up even those in the bar who were not even taking part in the game and arrested them for 'observing a crime'.

Another post on the pub's Facebook page added: 'Gerald won the first line, a tin of biscuits & a bar of chocolate. They even took them as evidence. By the way Pat wasn't playing either but that doesn't matter, he still ended up in the nick.

'When Pat was told that he observed the CRIME, he was now responsible & must share the responsibility.

'When I asked if I watched the euro millions being drawn, would I have to share the winnings? NO, that gambling is legal.So now we know, do it for a packet of biscuits & you get banged up. Do it for millions & that's OK.'
