Every school child in Los Angeles is to be given an iPad following a $30million deal with Apple.

The Los Angeles Unified School District announced on Tuesday the decision after teachers voted iPads the cheapest product and the best quality in the market.

iPads will now be handed out in 47 schools to give students from low-income households a better chance in the classroom as new national and state tests are to be taken on the devices.

Core issue: Each school student in Los Angeles is to get an iPad to use in class

Supt. John Deasy said that the tablet project would be paid for using school construction bonds that are repaid over decades, according to the LA Times.

By only using Apple devices, the school district will pay out millions of dollars to the California-based company over the next two years.

Mr Deasy and another board member did not take part in the vote on the iPads because each has stock in Apple.

Each iPad will cost $678 which is more than the retail price because it comes with special educational software.

Students will be allowed to take the devices home and although there will be blocks put in place for damaging material like pornography, children will be able to access social media.

However there were critics of the scheme including board member Richard Vladovic. He admitted that he had already dropped and broken two iPads and there was a danger students could do the same.
