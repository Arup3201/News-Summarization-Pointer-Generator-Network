Ballon D’or winner Cristiano Ronaldo gave away the reasoning behind his bizarre face mask Instagram upload - spending two days in Japan after becoming an ambassador for healthcare company MTG.

The Real Madrid megastar - maskless on this occasion - arrived at the press conference for MTG’s ‘Athletic Beauty Project’ by his new gulf-stream private jet.

This saw MTG formally announce that Ronaldo’s image will be used to market their ‘ReFa Active’ and ‘Facial Fitness PAO’ products across Asia.

MTG’s President and CEO Tsuyoshi Matsushita was understandably elated, declaring: 'We thought Cristiano Ronaldo was the only person who can represent our product.'

The 29-year-old’s alluded to his link-up with the firm earlier this week when he posted the Hannibal mask picture online - with this turning out to be one of MTG's products.

Ronaldo also spent time at a children’s football clinic, also based in Nagoya. The former Manchester United player displayed his trademark skills when playing against them, with him posing for photographs afterwards.

Portugal’s captain also got stuck into the country’s cultural customs, with him being seen pictured attending a traditional Japanese tea ceremony.

'I think Japan is a fantastic country, fantastic people,' he said.

'I had the opportunity to be here before and I know the fans here. They are amazing.'
