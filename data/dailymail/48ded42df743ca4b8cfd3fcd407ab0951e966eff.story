Tragic: Margaret Nicholl, pictured with her husband Richard, was thrown from her bike after hitting a pothole at 35mph

A retired civil servant was killed when she was thrown from her bike after hitting a deep pothole, an inquest heard yesterday.

Margaret Nicholl, 67, was on a country ride with husband Richard, 70, when they sped down a hill.

Mr Nicholl noticed five deep  craters at the side of the road and shouted a warning to his wife.

Seconds later she hit one of the ruts 
at 35mph and continued for several yards before falling off. She was not
wearing a helmet and suffered massive head injuries, dying ten days 
later in hospital.

The 
inquest at Wells Coroner’s Court in Somerset heard that the potholes had
been there for at least four months and the road was overdue for 
inspection.

Mr Nicholl told
the hearing he and his wife had been keen cyclists for more than half a
century and usually cycled up to 4,000 miles a year.

They had been cycling for three miles when they approached the hill in Shepton Montague, Somerset, at around 10am on March 12.

He said: ‘As we went over the brow of the hill I saw some potholes. I was slightly ahead of Margaret and to her right.

‘I pointed with my left hand and shouted “potholes”. Within two  seconds I heard a bang and I am sure she hit a pothole.

‘I then heard a dull thud as if she had fallen off her bike. I saw Margaret lying in the road still astride her bike. I went back to her and saw she was unconscious.’

An inquest into Mrs Nicholl's death heard that along with husband Richard, the couple cycled up to 4,000 miles each year

Scene: The pothole which Mrs Nicholl hit is marked with an orange box. A drinks can placed inside indicates that the pothole was quite large

PC David Horsley, of Avon and Somerset police, went to the scene shortly after the accident and measured the gradient of the hill to be nine per cent or one in 11.

He found five large potholes, with the largest measuring 39 inches (100cm) long, 19 inches (49cm) wide and three inches (8cm) deep.

The final pothole - measuring 26 inches (67cm) long, nearly 12 inches wide (30cm) wide and 2.5 inches (6cm) deep - had tyre tracks in mud on it which matched those of Margaret’s bike.

Phillip Kingdom, highways inspection manager for Somerset, said he was not surprised that the road was in such a bad state of repair.

Mrs Nicholl was rushed to the Royal United Hospital in Bath following the pothole accident, but sadly did not survive

‘We went through one of the most severe winters I have known. We were experiencing potholes all over the county.

‘We had 25,000 potholes last year in the county, which was a record. There was no extra money available at the time.’

Verdict: Accidental death.
