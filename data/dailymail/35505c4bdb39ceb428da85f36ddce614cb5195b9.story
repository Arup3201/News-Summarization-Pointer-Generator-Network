Clippers star J.J. Redick had a bizarre 'abortion' contract drawn up with his former girlfriend in which he agreed to keep dating her for a year, or pay her $25,000, if she terminated her pregnancy, it has been reported.

The written agreement was allegedly drawn up by the pair's lawyers in 2007, when Redick was still a rookie, and signed by the basketball player and his recent ex-girlfriend, model Vanessa Lopez, who was claiming to be pregnant with his child.

The startling contract, which is reportedly signed by the guard, stated: 'Redick has agreed that once Lopez has terminated said pregnancy and has provided medical proof... Redick and Lopez shall attempt to establish and maintain a social and/or dating relationship for a period of one year.'

MediaTakeOut unearthed the fascinating document today. Redick declined to comment to MailOnline on the contract.

The basketball star played for Orlando Magic for six and a half seasons before he was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks and then, about a month ago, to the Los Angeles Clippers.

In the six-year-old contract it states that if it turned out Lopez had never been pregnant or if she failed to follow through on the abortion, Redick would have no further obligations to keep up the dating charade.

If he simply got bored and didn't want to keep dating her following the abortion, he would be contractually required to give her 'written notice' 30 days prior to any break up and pay up the $25,000.

But if Lopez continued to hang around after the year was up, it would be considered 'stalking,' the extremely unromantic contract stipulates.

Redick's lawyer also insisted in the abortion agreement that the document itself may not be used to prove his putative paternity 'which paternity he has denied and does continue to deny.'

Lopez went on to have liaisons and subsequently take to court other NBA greats.

In 2010, she claimed Shaquille O'Neal harassed and threatened her after she ended an affair with the married basketball star, and filed a suit with celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred.

She accused the 7-foot-1 O'Neal of calling her incessantly against her wishes after the affair ended and then telling an associate to 'shut dat bitch up' after she threatened to come clean to his wife if he didn't stop.

On June 3, 2013 a judge called the model out for being a liar, dismissing the case against O'Neal and Lopez was dumped by Allred, who called her a fraud.
