The 27-year-old is believed to have tripped over the railing when part of it gave way under his weight as he grabbed for it at the Prince of Wales Hotel in Newcastle - two hours north of Sydney at about 8.50pm on Monday. 

The man was attending a work function and witnesses said the floor was not busy at the time of the accident, the Newcastle Herald reported.

Sam O'Shannessy, who lives nearby, said he saw a man lying on the road and about 10 friends dressed in costumes rush to his aid.

'They looked really distraught, it's extremely sad this has happened,' he told the newspaper.

Police are viewing CCTV footage to determine how the man fell. 

He is being treated at the John Hunter Hospital.
