Among the many difficulties that hardworking members of the U.S military must endure, is the long periods of separation from family and friends.

For one father and daughter that burden has become a little lighter after they were both deployed to the USS Harry S. Truman.

It is Breanna Janssen's first deployment to the ship where she will serve as a Gunner's Mate 3rd Class while her father David is the leading chief petty officer of maintenance for the Seahawks, of Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron 126, part of the tactical air force.

Duty calls: Father and daughter, Breanna and David Janssen have been deployed at the same time to the USS Harry S Truman

Family calling: Both father and daughter were delighted to be on the same ship in what is Miss Janssen's first deployment and likely to her father's final one

The father and daughter, are originally from Welsh, Louisiana. Miss Janssen, 21, who is stationed at Norfolk, Virginia, told News Channel 3: 'It’s comforting to know that there’s always someone to talk to, no matter what’s going on in my life. Having my dad on board provides me with a great stress reliever.'

Her father added: 'With all of my years of experience of life in the Navy, I can help her with problems I’ve already faced myself.'

Mr Janssen said the experience is 
made extra special by the fact that while it is his daughter's first time at sea, this is likely to be his last.

The young woman said that she was inspired to join the Navy because of her father's example and distinguished career which includes eight previous deployments.

The Navy allows siblings to serve together however a parent serving with a child is unusual.

The USS Harry S Truman was built in 1993 and is named after the 33rd President of the United States.
