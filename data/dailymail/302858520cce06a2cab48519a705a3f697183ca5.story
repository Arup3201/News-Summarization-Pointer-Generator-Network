Some people use the Snapchat app for exchanging suggestive pictures of themselves, as pictured

The photo sharing app Snapchat has released a list of rules on their website for underage users, that includes strict instructions for teenagers to keep their clothes on.  

Staff at the organisation have also released a guide for parents in order to alleviate fears over teenagers using the technology for sexting.

The six-page manual to teach adults about how to use the technology and to reassure them about the safety features installed.

The list of things NOT to be done on the site include pornography, nudity for those under 18, threats, impersonation and self-harm. 

It follows up with: 'Don’t use Snapchat for any illegal shenanigans and if you’re under 18 or are Snapping with someone who might be: keep your clothes on!'  

In the separate section for parents, staff seek to explain why children like to use the app so much, saying: 'It's been (rightfully) drummed into their heads for years that photos and videos you share are on the Web forever and are really hard to take back, so Snapchat's a relief in a lot of ways.'

Snapchat is incredibly popular among 13 to 25 year olds, but the technology has been hit with bad publicity since its inception for the amount of young people who use it to exchange sexy pictures. 

In the new guide, Snapchat reveals that the majority of people using the app don't exchange x-rated images.

Addressing concerned parents, the writer says: 'Though there's nothing inherently dangerous about Snapchat, early news coverage fairly predictably associated disappearing photos sent on phones with "sexting." 

'Many assume Snapchat's biggest draw is the temporary nature of its messages, which encourages people to share racy images without worrying about the repercussions. 

'But most people – including most teens -- don’t use Snapchat that way. They use it because it’s fun.'

Snapchat have launched a new guide for parents to help alleviate any concerns they have about the app

It goes on to offer helpful tips for parents to pass on to their children about the type of things to bear in mind when sending a picture to a friend. 

They include: 'Be nice – it really helps. Just as in physical settings, people generally react, interact and share things in a friendly way on Snapchat too. 

'[Know] who to share with - Snapchat was originally designed for sharing with friends in "real life" – or at least people in your phone contacts. 

'Context is key - a positive experience on Snapchat truly depends on the situation being Snapped and the relationship you have with the friends you're sharing with.'

It finishes by comparing teaching your children how to use Snapchat with helping them learn how to swim.  

The pamphlet says: 'There’s no need to panic every time you hear a media report about something awful happening in social media. 

'The reason the news media cover awful situations is because they’re rare. 

'How often do you see headlines about planes landing safely? We only hear about the ones that crash. 

'Of course kids can get into trouble using Snapchat or any other service, but the same can be said for swimming pools. That’s why we teach them how to swim.'
