Major serial: House Of Cards, the new drama starring Kevin Spacey, is a $100million TV series commissioned exclusively for streaming service Netflix

What is going on in the world of home entertainment? Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey recreates a Machiavellian anti-hero from one of British TV’s best-loved dramas, and virtually no one is watching.

If you live in London, you might have seen posters featuring a presidential Spacey posing on the stone throne of the Lincoln Memorial, fingers gripping the armrests. But that’s probably all you’ve seen of it. Even if you’re one of the estimated one million UK subscribers with access to watch House Of Cards via an American internet service, you probably won’t be glued to the same episodes as anyone else you know.

The entire series, all 13 parts of it, was dumped online last Friday, like a bootlegged box-set of DVDs falling off the back of a lorry. For House Of Cards is a television spectacular that isn’t on TV.

Instead, the $100million series is being ‘streamed’ on the web via Netflix — a £5.99 monthly subscription service that lets users watch broadcast content via the internet, on a computer, a tablet or a phone. You could view it on a high-definition telly hooked up to an online games console.

What you can’t do is switch on the TV and watch it on any conventional channel, no matter how many your satellite package offers. It isn’t there.

This is the first time a major serial has been commissioned exclusively for a streaming web service and, at $100m represents a bold gamble by Netflix. The expense and sheer quality of the show emphasise that it is intended as a competitor to the biggest U.S. series — a web-only equivalent of Homeland or Mad Men.

Spacey plays a conniving Washington kingmaker who decides to put the White House crown on his own head after the new president breaks a promise to appoint him Secretary of State. His wife, played as an ice queen by Robin Wright, is ruthless, heartless and quietly insane — a modern-day Lady Macbeth.

It achieves a chilling atmosphere of camp, rare in U.S. dramas. Spacey plays Congressman Frank Underwood as a chain-smoking aesthete, an habitue of art galleries and the opera, who reacts with physical revulsion to the thought of exercise when his wife buys him a rowing machine. But he is also cold-bloodedly diabolical, able to destroy an old friend’s career as dispassionately as he chokes an injured dog to death.

The original House Of Cards aired as a four-part series on BBC1 in 1990, starring Ian Richardson as a Tory chief whip whose scheming mind goes into hyperdrive after the resignation of the Prime Minister. It was the BBC’s good fortune that the screening coincided with the overthrow of Margaret Thatcher.

Screenwriter Andrew Davies had adapted the novel by Michael Dobbs — who had worked as the Conservative Party’s chief of staff under Thatcher — and it soon became compulsive Sunday night viewing throughout Britain. At Number 10, the new prime minister John Major (once a whip himself) and his staff apparently dropped whatever they were doing to watch it.

And they weren’t the only ones. Across Britain, more than 15m a week were gripped. Richardson’s urbane, devious catchphrase — ‘You might think that; I couldn’t possibly comment’ — was on every tongue (and is occasionally used by Spacey in the new version).

Risk: The $100million for House Of Cards represents a big gamble for Netflix

It was sensational TV, a talking point in offices and pubs everywhere. That almost half the adult viewers in Britain were united in watching this modern take on a Shakespearean revenge tragedy created a communal feeling.

Mass entertainment that brought the nation to a halt was not a new concept. At its height in the Fifties, the radio sitcom Hancock’s Half Hour was so popular that pubs emptied when it aired — everyone wanted to be at home, listening and laughing with the family.

The streets were abandoned when Tony Hancock was on.

It is this collective experience that has been sacrificed to technology. The convenience of being able to watch what we want, on any format, in any place from a bedroom to a bus, has come at a colossal cost — we watch alone.

Family: The collective experience of sharing television has been sacrificed by technology

What once bound families and created communities is now a lonely, divisive ritual we cannot share. TV can’t bring us together any more; it splits us up.

We have screens in every room — and instead of family debates and compromises, teaching children negotiation and fair play, everybody is free to be as moodily selfish as they like.

A pocket-size touchscreen device and a set of headphones might mean children can watch a favourite show in the palm of a hand, while screening out conversations around them, but it also prevents anyone watching with them.

Netflix is currently a sideshow — largely filled with half-forgotten TV shows and old movies for users to rummage through. It’s like the world’s biggest second-hand DVD market stall.

It has an estimated 27.5m subscribers in the U.S., but barely a tenth of that in the rest of the world, and runs at a loss.

Even when it makes new material available, such as the zombie drama Walking Dead (previously shown on cable channel AMC), viewing figures are underwhelming: 200,000 fans opted to watch the whole series in the first 24 hours — a huge number with nothing better to do, but a tiny blip in the overall TV market. Small wonder Netflix executives say they won’t be publishing audience figures for House Of Cards.

They are no doubt underwhelming.

The release of all 13 episodes at once, enabling fans to watch them back-to-back, gorging themselves in square-eyed binges, has other implications for TV traditions.

Gone are the flashback summaries that open each episode in many conventional series — viewers don’t need them if watching a continuous stream.

Netflix executives don’t like the term ‘bingeing’ to describe this phenomenon — it sounds unhealthy.

They prefer ‘marathoning’. But they accept that viewers tend to gobble up shows so fast that plot summaries are superfluous.

‘We assume you know what’s happening, whereas TV has to assume a big chunk of the audience is always tuning in [for the first time],’ said Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer.

That ignores traditional viewers, the vast majority. Much as we’d like to sit in our pyjamas and bask in television rays like lizards soaking up sunshine, we have other obligations.

If producers dispense with potted explanations and expect us to use Google to find out what happened last week, TV will become a chore. Imagine coping with complex dramas such as The Killing without a flurry of intercut moments from previous weeks to refresh the memory and set the scene.

It gets worse. Beau Willimon, the producer of House Of Cards, predicts dramas will soon be made in a single flow, as long as blockbuster novels, ten or 20 hours of programming without a break: he’d like to ‘dispense with episodes altogether,’ he said, ‘you decide where to pause.’

At that point, the concept of tension, of cliffhangers, of everything that makes drama compelling, is lost. The rhythm and discipline imposed on scriptwriters and directors will evaporate.

House Of Cards is scheduled in 50-minute episodes, a conventional format but there’s no reason — they might as well run for 20 minutes or three hours.

Technology hasn’t just fragmented the market — it has shattered it into smithereens. Perhaps that’s a good thing.

We’ve been in thrall to the telly for a lifetime; maybe we should all switch off and do something more constructive instead.

But as a confirmed gogglebox addict, all I can say is: ‘You might think that; I couldn’t possibly comment.’
