Researchers claim that a brutal slave-trader who brought captive slaves from West Africa to Colonial America is the same man whose descendants produced two U.S. presidents. George W. Bush and his father, George H.W. Bush.

Historians already knew that the Bush family was directly connected to Thomas Walker, yet they were unable to figure out which was the ancestor of the Bush's.

Records show there was a Thomas Walker who was a merchant from Baltimore who was in Great Britain in 1758.

Looking back: Researchers claim that a notoriously vicious slave-trader who brought captive slaves from West Africa to Colonial America is the same man whose descendants produced two U.S. presidents

History of slavery: You have to go back six generations to find the ancestor that is directly linked to the present day George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush

Keeping it in the family: Over the course of 200 years it is clear to see how the former Presidents are related to their slavemaster ancestor

Archives also show Thomas Walker was a slave merchant and captain who bought and sold West African slaves in the late 1700s.

However, it was only recently that a retired genealogist and a historian in Sierra Leone finally figured out the two Thomas Walkers are actually the same person.

Two men helped to clear up the murky past of the Bush's. Roger Hughes, a retired newspaper editor and genealogist in Illinois has previously documented other Bush ancestors as slave owners in the United States and Joseph Opala, an American historian who has spent much of his adult life in Sierra Leone, the former British colony on the West African coast.

Missing link: The ancestral link between the Bush family and the slave trade is confirmed

History: Although Britain outlawed slavery in 1833 and it was abolished in the USA after the defeat of the Confederacy in the Civil War in 1865, the transatlantic trade in African slaves continued

Supporter of African: On his 2003 visit to Goree Island, a former slave fort off the coast of the Senegal, George W. Bush denounced the slave trade as one of 'the greatest crimes of history.'

Analysis of old records and signatures now provides confirmation.

Walker married in 1785 at Bristol, which along with London and Liverpool was one of the three British cities highly involved in the Atlantic slave trade. He later emigrated to the United States.

Scans of the two Walkers' signatures were sent experts at Yale and at UCL in London without any information on their significance. Both experts confirmed that the signatures were written by the same person.

Thomas Walker married Catherine McLelland had three children, Rosetta, Thomas, and George, born between 1785 and 1797.

Thomas Walker's third son was named George, and his grandson who born in 1875, was the first George Herbert Walker and it is his descendants that lead to the presidency.

George's daughter, Dorothy, married Prescott Bush, and their son and grandson became the Presidents 41 and 43 of the USA.

Members of the family had been previously known to own slaves, but so did 12 other presidents, including eight who were still in office.

Walker and his family died year before slavery was outlawed and so his profession wouldn't have seemed out of place at the time.

Many European merchants and American plantation owners grew rich on the trade that transported more than 10 million Africans to North America.

It seems Walker was almost as cruel to his fellow sailors as the slaves he bought and sold.

An account of his death says, 'There could not possibly have been a more inhuman monster than this Walker. Many a poor seaman has been brought by him to an untimely end.'

It might explain why his own crew members held a mutiny shooting him dead and throwing him overboard during a voyage 1797.

In the present day, on his 2003 visit to Goree Island, a former slave fort off the coast of the Senegalese capital, Dakar, George W. Bush denounced the slave trade as one of 'the greatest crimes of history.'

'Small men took on the powers and airs of tyrants and masters,' he said. 'Some have said we should not judge their failures by the standards of a later time. Yet, in every time, there were men and women who clearly saw this sin and called it by name.'

The Bush family's spokesman in Houston, Jim McGrath, had no comment on the findings and The George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas as also not commented on the findings.
