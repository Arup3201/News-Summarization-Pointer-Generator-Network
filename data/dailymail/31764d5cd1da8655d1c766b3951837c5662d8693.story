Corporations are doing nothing to attract workers under 35 because millennials have a reputation for being workplace divas.

A new survey conducted by Duke University and CFO Magazine found that millennials are thought to need more management in the workplace and are also known for leaving jobs at the drop of the hat.

Unfortunately for millennials they are making much less money than their parents did and the economy is still slowly crawling its way out of an economic recession.

 The brunt of the stick: Not only is the economy tearing its way out of an economic recession, corporations are doing nothing the employee workers under 35 who they view as disloyal and entitled 

Least employed: Millennials have the highest unemployment rate of all generations but also the highest rate of part time employment 

CBS reports that the recent report surveyed more than a thousand chief financial officers worldwide and while some of them had good things to say about millennials other's expressed their disdain for the younger generation.

70 per cent of CFOs surveyed said that millennials were more tech savvy than workers over 35.

21 per cent said that millenials were more creative than the typical employee.

Millennials are also willing to work for less money than their older counterparts.

Despite being great with computers and creative, millennials were also thought to have a sense of entitlement.

More than half of CFOs said that millennials were disloyal to their companies.

46 per cent said that millennials had a sense of entitlement, and 27 per cent said millennials were more interested than their own personal development than the development of the company as a whole.

Low earnings: Despite not earning very much right now millennials believe they will make more money in the future if they are able to find a job  

Fickle: Millenials are more likely than other generations to switch jobs and stay employed for under a year

The report also states that companies aren't adapting to the mobile and tech savvy generation of creatives.

Only 21 per cent of companies make work hours flexible for their employees, only 17 per cent are allowed to work from home, and only 10 per cent are changing the corporate culture.

CBS reports that is millennials were to stay at their jobs longer then companies might be more accommodating.

A report conducted by the department of labor found that millennials had an average of 6.2 jobs by the time they were 27.

The report found that they stayed in all of those jobs for less than a year.

A study by Fidelity found that millennials stay with a job for three years on average.

Unfortunately female millennials have it the worst it seems.

CFOs said in the survey that they didn't believe there were enough women who had the skill set necessary to serve on the board of a company.

On a lighter note CFOs said that they were starting to feel better about the economy.

They believe that both employment and wages will increase by 3 per cent in the coming years.
