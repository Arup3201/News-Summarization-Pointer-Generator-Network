A shocked couple watched on as a coastguard team dramatically rescued their pet dog trapped down a 200ft cliff.

John Griffiths, 47, and his wife Michelle, 36, looked on as their German shepherd Chloe was hauled back up to safety.

The complex operation took more than an hour to carry out on the seafront at Cromer, north Norfolk, yesterday morning.

And the crowd of holidaymakers and locals who gathered to see the drama unfold cheered as Chloe was rescued.

Mrs Griffiths wept with relief when she was reunited with her pet dog.

She said: 'I am just so relieved that she is not hurt - the Coastguard did a brilliant job.'

The couple were walking along the cliff top  with six-year-old Chloe and 14-month-old Tilly, a German Shepherd crossed with a Siberian Husky, when the older dog slipped and tumbled.

Mr Griffiths said: 'We didn't see Chloe go off the cliff but we knew something had happened when she disappeared. You read about dogs going off cliffs and you think, how can that happen, but it can.

'I could not believe that she had got that close to the cliff.' 

Mr Griffiths bravely slid down part of the way through thick bushes and undergrowth in a desperate bid to get to Chloe.

But he quickly realised it was far too dangerous and rang 999 to raise the alarm.

Ten members of the Mundesley, Sheringham and Cromer Coastguard units arrived about 10 minutes later, along with Cromer fire crew members and a police.

They set up special ropes and a tugger machine to lower Sheringham Coastguard's Jerry Woodley down the cliff.

Mr Woodley, said he found Chloe barking with terror and trapped about 60ft down the steep 200ft cliff.

He said it was a tough rescue as dense brambles totally covered the dog. 

'It was hard trying to get the dog in the rescue bag. Once we achieved that, it was fairly straightforward', he said.  

Mr Griffiths, who made a generous donation to the Coastguard as a token of his appreciation for saving Chloe's life, said: 'They were fantastic - especially when you think they are all volunteers.

'We just cannot thank them enough.'
