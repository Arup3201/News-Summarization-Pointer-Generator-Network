Julie Spence, the former chief constable of Cambridgeshire, says the force spent ‘far more on the team doing the CRB checks  than we were actually putting into child protection'

More police resources are devoted to vetting law-abiding volunteers and job applicants than pursuing and monitoring sex offenders, a former chief constable warns today.

Last year, 843,000 volunteers were given criminal record checks, including parents who go into school to help children read or assist on trips.

A study today for the Civitas think-tank finds that the Coalition has failed in its pledge to more than halve Disclosure and Barring Service checks, formerly known as Criminal Record Bureau checks, from 4million to 1.7million a year.

Some 3.9million checks were carried out last year on volunteers and job applicants who could have unsupervised contact with children.

Julie Spence, the former chief constable of Cambridgeshire, says the force spent ‘far more on the team doing the CRB checks – because they were funded by government – than we were actually putting into child protection’.

She told researchers: ‘In most forces, more money goes into checks than investigation.’

Mrs Spence claimed armies of staff worked on vetting nationwide, but the monitoring of sex offenders was generally the responsibility of a ‘small team’ of officers who ‘don’t have an enormous budget’.

Offenders deemed to present the highest risk could get visits weekly or a couple of times a month, she said, while the least risky would be seen perhaps once ‘every few months’.

After coming to power in 2010, the Coalition pledged to slash the use of checks by the Disclosure and Barring Service. But anyone who could have unsupervised contact with children at least once a month must still be checked.

Town halls made 661,092 checks last year on those such as parents running the school disco and volunteers who drive the elderly to the shops.

The report’s author, Josie Appleton, said public bodies appeared to be going beyond what was required by the law, with local authorities carrying out checks on public sector jobs such as tree surgeons and a beauty therapy lecturer.

There are 23 types of checks, depending on the type of position involved. The most basic service costs £26. An enhanced check for a teacher, nurse or care home worker costs £46.

The total cost has been £2billion in a decade, including £211.6million last year. Much of this goes to the consultancy firms making the checks.

Among others, there are 730 people employed by the DBS, hundreds of police staff, workers from 3,688 bodies who submit checks, and 300 employees at Tata Consultancy Services.

But Miss Appleton said that often the worst offenders would not be picked up anyway, adding: ‘It is notable that many of the shocking cases of child abuse in recent years – from Jimmy Savile to the Catholic Church – involved individuals without criminal records. The failure was a failure to report and to investigate allegations, rather than a lack of checking.’

The Home Office said: ‘Criminal records checks are essential. We changed the vetting and barring arrangements because the old system was disproportionate and excessive. Without these changes the number of checks would have increased significantly.’

Rapes recorded by the police have hit their highest level ever, with an average of 60 attacks every day.

Shocking figures, disclosed yesterday, showed that rapes in England and Wales rose by almost 30 per cent to 22,116 in the year to June.

Knifepoint rapes were up by 48 per cent to 294 attacks – almost six a week. According to the Office for National Statistics figures, 13,455 of the victims were women, the rest being men and children.

Ministers said victims were ‘more willing’ to report sex crimes and police were more likely to take complaints seriously, partly due to greater scrutiny following the Jimmy Savile scandal. Police recording practices had also improved.

ONS head of crime John Flatley said: ‘We have seen over the last few years a notable rise in victims coming forward to report historical offences. So victims are coming forward now to report recent occurrences rather than historical ones.’

The total number of crimes reported to forces in England and Wales was 3.7million, the same as the previous year.

Violent crime surged by 11 per cent to 666,700 offences, but the ONS said this could be due to police recording complaints more accurately after accusations of ‘fiddling’ figures to meet targets.

The picture was complicated by the Crime Survey of England and Wales, which indicated violent crime had fallen by 23 per cent. The survey, which is based on people’s experiences of crime, found a 16 per cent fall in overall crime to 7.1million incidents, the lowest since 1981, but it did not include 300,000 frauds.

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘These figures show a shocking failure to help rape victims and bring dangerous criminals to justice.’
