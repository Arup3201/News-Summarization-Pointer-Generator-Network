Forget hair of the dog and fancy hangover cures – bleary-eyed Britons turned to the simple formula of chips and Coca-Cola to help them recover from New Year Eve’s festivities.

Figures show they were the most commonly ordered items from online takeaway menus on January 1.

Just Eat, which represents more than 22,000 restaurants, said more than 250,000 takeaways were ordered by revellers as they sought comfort food while recuperating from the night before.

Coca-Cola’s reputation as a hangover cure has seen the fizzy drink dubbed the ‘Black Doctor’ or ‘Red Ambulance’.

In recent months, model Kate Moss, singer Pixie Lott and actor Tom Cruise have all reportedly been seen drinking it while looking worse for wear.

Fans of the drink credit its mixture of caffeine and sugar, while others claim it is the bubbles that help to settle their stomachs.

Vogue magazine has described Coca-Cola as the ‘perfect sugar-to- caffeine ratio when you’re exhausted and veering dangerously towards hypoglycemia [low blood sugar levels] after a night on the fruit punch’.

According to figures compiled by Just Eat for the Daily Telegraph, the most popular meal excluding Coca-Cola and chips was a margherita pizza.

This was also the most commonly ordered fast food on Christmas Day.

Takeaways over both days are growing in popularity with orders via the Just Eat website jumping by 50 per cent on New Year’s Day compared to the previous year.

Chinese takeaways are the nation’s year-round favourite, according to figures from market research firm NPD Group.

It comes as experts said champagne and sparkling wine can cause the worst hangovers. A US academic said the drink’s bubbles cause alcohol to be absorbed into the bloodstream more quickly.

Boris Tabakoff, pharmacology professor at the University of Colorado, told ABC News: ‘You get a faster rate of absorption, higher blood alcohol levels – and brain levels – if you drink champagne as opposed to something non-carbonated.’
