The Commonwealth Bank has finally apologised for dodgy financial dealings that spanned over a decade and lost its customers hundreds of millions of dollars.

On Thursday, chief executive Ian Narev faced the media to issue a long-awaited apology - a week after a Senate report slammed the bank for its poor handling of the scandal.

'To all the customers who received poor advice, I apologise unreservedly,' Mr Narev told reporters in Sydney.

'We are truly sorry and we acknowledge the financial hardship that you suffered as a result of the poor advice.'

A Senate report - headed by former Western Australia senator Mark Bishop - blasted the bank and corporate watchdog, Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), for their lacklustre responses to fraud and misconduct allegations levelled at some of CBA financial planners.

It also recommended a royal commission be launched into the bank.

Between 2003 and 2012, customers lost large amounts of life savings after they were switched into high-risk investment products without consent, and in some cases financial planners were forging client signatures to approve profit-producing product switches.

Mr Narev also announced a review into the bank's financial dealings over the 10 years called the Open Advice Review program on Thursday.

It will allow customers to request a review of their case from the bank, and a further option would be available to have it reviewed by an independent panel chosen by the bank.

Mr Narev said the bank has already paid out $52 million worth in compensation to 1,100 people who were affected by the scandal, but some reports suggest the number affected might be as high as 12,000.

But he said any more money to be paid out would be 'inconsequential' for shareholders in the $130 billion banking giant.

And investors seemed unmoved by the developments. CBA shares rose 63 cents on Thursday to $81.55.

But critics say the bank's latest review doesn't go far enough.

Mark Bishop said the new compensation review did not differ much from existing arrangements.

'I welcome the apology of Mr Narev - that is a welcome development - but overall what we have on the table is marginal change at best,' he told the ABC.

Law firm Maurice Blackburn, which has represented affected CBA customers, questioned the appointment process for the bank's independent panel and customer advocates.

'If it's the Commonwealth Bank that appoints them, then that's not independent,' Maurice Blackburn partner John Berrill said.

Former Senator Mark Bishop chaired and handed down the senate report that called for a royal commission into the bank and slammed its response to the scandal

But federal government figures backed the review, including Treasurer Joe Hockey, whose mother-in-law was among those hurt by the scandal.

'You've got to have a plan to ensure that people are given appropriate compensation. They're starting to do that but there's obviously a way to go,' he said.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott played down the prospect of a royal commission into the financial planning industry.

'I don't want to overdo the reviews because in the end what people expect from government is appropriate action not endless study, particularly studies which don't necessarily lead to outcomes,' he said.
