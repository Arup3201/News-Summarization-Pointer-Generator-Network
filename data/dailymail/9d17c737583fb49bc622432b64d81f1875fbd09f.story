To anyone under the age of 40, Paul Elliott is instantly recognisable as one half of the Chuckle Brothers, children’s TV favourites from 1987 onwards.

With Paul playing straight man to his hapless older brother Barry, the pair made  an impressive 21 series of their hit BBC show Chucklevision, famous for its slapstick humour and catchphrases such as ‘to me, to you’.

They filmed their last series in 2009, making it the longest running sitcom after Last Of The Summer Wine.

With their success came all the trappings, and Paul’s five-bedroom gated home, Half Acres – with its well-stocked bar room, snooker room and grounds of one-and-a-half acres – is testimony to this.

Set in the pleasant village of Hatfield in South Yorkshire, Half Acres is a 15-minute drive from Doncaster and not far from Rotherham, where Paul and Barry grew up in a council house with their two older brothers and their parents – mum Amy and father James, a gang show performer.

However,  you could say that Paul has become a victim of his own success. The palatial house, set down a private road, has been on the market for nearly two years. Despite reducing the asking price by £150,000 to £550,000, he has yet to find a buyer.

‘We’ve had only four or five viewings in all that time,’ says Paul, who believes the house may be just too expensive for local buyers.

‘The average house price around here is in the region of £95,000; we’re charging more than five times that.’

Hard sell: Mr Elliot has been forced to lower the price for the home with £150,000 to £550,000 as he struggles to find a buyer

In frustration, he has just changed estate agents. According to Julian Brown, director at Portfield, Garrard and Wright, Paul’s new agents, it has been a tough few years for prices in the region. He explains that prices have yet to recover to pre-2008 levels but things are starting to look up.

‘Last month was cracking, our best in four years,’ he says, ‘but there are few buyers in Paul’s price range and because it’s such a unique property, it has to find its own level.’

Paul’s material possessions have been hard won. This is the Chuckle Brothers’ 50th year as a double act – they found fame after winning the TV talent show New Faces in 1974 – and the pair have just embarked on their 46th panto run, in Darlington.

Although both in their late 60s, the brothers show no sign of slowing down and spend their time travelling around the country for personal appearances at everything from pub quizzes to corporate team-building events, as well as touring with their own show. ‘I can’t imagine retiring because it’s such good fun,’ says Paul.

He admits the panto season – two performances a day, six days a week until February – is pretty exhausting. ‘It’s not an easy life but it’s better than going down the pit,’ says Paul, whose first job was working in a Sheffield steelworks.

Paul and wife Sue, 56, bought Half Acres for £300,000 in 2002 and have spent about £50,000 extending it, adding a master bedroom suite with bathroom and dressing room. Now that their youngest two sons are in their early 20s, they are keen to downsize and plan to spend much of the year at their Brittany farmhouse.

Despite struggling to sell his current home, Paul still thinks property is a good place to invest his money. ‘Obviously I’m not happy about having to reduce the price but we will still have made money on the house if we sell for the new asking price.’

The couple decided to invest in other properties soon after moving to Half Acres.

They built a five-bedroom villa with pool on the Greek island of Kefalonia, which they rent to holidaymakers, and own a two-bedroom apartment on the island, where they themselves holiday. They have also bought a two-bed apartment in Calabria, Italy, which they visit twice a year.
