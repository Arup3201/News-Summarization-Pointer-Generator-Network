Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy today stepped up the war of words with Britain, vowing to do everything to 'defend' his country's interests.

In a fresh escalation of the diplomatic tensions between Britain and Spain over Gibraltar, Mr Rajoy promised to take 'all necessary legal steps' in the stand-off after holding a meeting with King Juan Carlos.

It comes as British warships are being sent to Gibraltar by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond to demonstrate the Royal Navy’s ‘formidable strength.

Westminster depart for Gibraltar on Monday even as the diplomatic row 
with Madrid escalates over plans for draconian border controls.

Mr Rajoy said he hoped to hold talks with Britain to end the dispute over shipping and increased border checks.

But until then he would step up unilateral action to protect Spain from outside threats.

He said: 'I
hope that this doesn't go any further, but it's clear that Spain has to
defend its national interest and that's what we're going to do.'

Downing Street said it was aware of the remarks, which come just two days after David Cameron warned Mr Rajoy that increased checks and plans to charge £43 to enter and leave the Rock were ‘totally disproportionate and unacceptable’.

It was seen as coded warning that 
Britain is prepared to take Spain to court if it goes ahead with 
measures which are seen to be in breach of European law.

With diplomatic relations between 
Britain and Spain over Gibraltar already in the deep freeze, the 
Ministry of Defence announced details of the naval deployment to the region, called Cougar ’13.

Mr
Hammond said the planned deployment of a total of 10 vessels to the 
region as part of a rapid reaction force will underline the Navy’s 
'global reach'.

The move comes just days after Gibraltar’s chief minister called for the British military to send forces into the area.

Ten vessels including the aircraft  
carrier Illustrious, two frigates and support ships are heading to the 
waters off Gibraltar as part of an annual exercise.

News that British warships are heading to Gibraltar is likely to add to the tensions with Spain

But defence officials revealed that three of them – the frigate Westminster and two support vessels – will call in at the British sovereign base at Gibraltar for three days, beginning on August 19.

In a show of force, the warships will practise ‘a range of operations’ including ‘deterring adversaries’.

Mr Hammond said: ‘Since its creation under the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, the Response Force Task Group has demonstrated its formidable strength and readiness to respond to emerging threats worldwide through a number of operations and exercises.

‘This now routine and long-planned deployment will demonstrate once again its ability to operate as a rapid reaction force on behalf of the UK and, importantly, underlines the global reach and flexibility of the modern Royal Navy.’

The deployment follows demands from the 
government of Gibraltar for the coalition to beef up its naval presence 
off the Rock, and calls for gunboat diplomacy from Tory MPs.

Commodore Paddy McAlpine, Commander UK
Task Group, said: 'Cougar 13 is a bespoke opportunity to enhance the 
Royal Navy’s enduring core skill – the ability to operate and project 
power as a task group at range. In so doing, it will also remind 
interested domestic and international parties of the enduring utility, 
employability and interoperability of the Royal Navy.

'During
Cougar 13 we will engage with our partner nations through a series of 
exercises, reinforcing our commitment and demonstrating our contribution
to security in the Mediterranean and Gulf region.'

Mr Cameron broke the news that the task 
force was set to sail to Mr Rajoy in the tense phone call on Wednesday 
which failed to resolve the diplomatic standoff.

Ready for anything: Ahead of the deployment, the Vikings of the Armoured Support Group spent last week on the ranges at Lulworth in Dorset to hone their shooting skills

Tensions: The British Foreign Office fears the proposed Spanish border charges would penalise islanders who regularly commute to Spain for work

Downing Street claimed Mr Rajoy had 
offered to ‘de-escalate’ the  crisis after Mr Cameron issued a coded 
warning that Britain might take Spain to the European Court of Justice 
over the ‘disproportionate’ border checks.

But within minutes of the call, the Spanish government insisted they were doing nothing wrong.

Spanish
foreign minister Jose Garcia-Margallo has threatened to impose tolls at
the border and ban Gibraltar-bound aircraft from Spanish airspace 
because the government of Gibraltar sank concrete blocks off the Rock to
deter Spanish fishermen.

Last night Tory MP Andrew Rosindell, a
member of the all-party Parliamentary group on Gibraltar, said: ‘It’s 
wonderful news that the Royal Navy is on its way but I’d prefer it if 
this deployment was in response to the behaviour of the Spanish.

‘If they’re going down there, they might as well stay while this situation is going on.

‘The
most powerful thing we could do is to announce that the Queen is going 
to visit. That would send the strongest signal that Gibraltar is 
British.’

Appeal: David Cameron asked the Spanish Prime Minister to scale back contentious border checks with the British territory, including blocking flights to Gibraltar

Access: The Spanish government raised the prospect of imposing a 50 euros (£43) charge on vehicles entering Gibraltar and closing Spanish airspace to flights heading for the Rock

On the ground, Spanish officials again forced motorists to wait for hours yesterday, imposing more border checks when they spotted UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall viewing their operations.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: ‘The Royal Navy’s annual Cougar deployment is long-planned and well-established.

‘Gibraltar is a strategic base for UK defence and as such Royal Navy ships visit its waters throughout the year as part of a range of regular and routine deployments.’
