CCTV images have captured the moment a woman brazenly stole a charity box full of cash from a mobility shop.

The woman, accompanied by a young boy and appearing drunk, visited Eden Mobility in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, posing as a customer.

Unaware she was being caught on camera, the woman picked up a collection box for the British Heart Foundation and shook it, seemingly checking how much money was inside.

She is then captured putting the cash box into her handbag before a member of staff returns from the back of the shop.

The thief then pretended she needed to get some cash because her credit card was damaged - but unsurprisingly, she did not return.

John Heaton, senior manager at Eden Mobility, said: 'In my opinion stealing money that has been collected for charity is worse than stealing stock from the shop.

'It's a very callous thing to do.

'I don't think this was an impulsive decision. The woman smelt strongly of alcohol and the fact that she had a child with her makes it worse.'

When staff realised the cash box had been stolen they checked CCTV footage and found these images. 

They are now appealing for anyone with information about the woman to come forward.

They have also passed the footage to police. 

The woman is described as white, in her late 20s with long dark hair and wearing a grey top with beige Ugg-style boots.

The theft happened at around 4.45pm on Wednesday May 15.

Inspector Richard Close, of the Central neighbourhood police team, said: 'This offence shows either extreme desperation or someone with no conscience.

'Thefts always end up having a victim, in this case there are numerous victims who would have benefited from other people's generosity.

'If you can identify the woman in the picture please contact the police.'

A spokeswoman for the British Heart Foundation condemned the theft as as 'very sad'.
