Neil Lennon's future as Celtic manager is in serious doubt.

Sportsmail understands the Northern Irishman feels he may have taken the club as far as it can go with him at the helm and is giving his position careful consideration.

Fresh from winning a third successive Scottish league title, Lennon should now be plotting the route to a Champions League group campaign.

But he’s believed to be concerned about having the quality in his squad to negotiate the three tricky qualifying ties that lie in wait  – with the added disadvantage of playing out of Murrayfield as Celtic Park is out of commission due to the Commonwealth Games.

Speculation over Lennon’s future intensified when bookmakers Paddy Power suddenly slashed the odds on Henrik Larsson – currently in charge of Swedish club Falkenbergs - becoming the new manager.

However, Hakan Nilsson, sports director of Falkensbergs, told Sportsmail there has been no contact from Celtic regarding the legendary striker.

With Lennon due to fly off on holiday at the end of this week before a stint as a BBC analyst at the World Cup finals in Brazil, the former captain is seeking some answers before he goes.

Trusted deputy Johan Mjallby recently quit the club and a decision on his replacement has been shelved until Lennon’s own fate becomes clearer.

Speculation is also rife about the immediate futures of Virgil van Dijk and Fraser Forster and Lennon’s concerns over the squad would be further heightened were either to be sold before they begin their campaign on July 15.

Barring a dramatic change of heart in the next 48 hours, there’s every chance Celtic will be beginning the search for their 17th manager by as soon as next week.

If that comes to pass, Sportsmail believes former Celtic player and Cardiff manager Malky Mackay would top the wish list.

Mackay holds the club in huge regard and has ambitions to manage at Parkhead one day – but he also has a wish to return to management in the English Premiership sooner rather than later.

David Moyes, recently sacked by Manchester United, is free to consider a return to his first love but that option seems unlikely.

Steve Clarke, the former West Brom manager, is also in the mix together with ex-Swansea deputy Morten Wieghorst.

Jackie McNamara, the Dundee United manager, would be a popular choice with supporters although the acrimonious nature of his departure to Wolves in 2005 might count against him.

Larsson, meanwhile, went from 20/1 outsider to odds-on favourite with two bookmakers.

In the running: Malky Mackay has been touted for a Celtic return too

Whoever is appointed the next Celtic manager has a tough act to follow.

Lennon served Celtic as a player between 2000 and 2007 before returning as first team coach the following season.

He was demoted to reserve team manager after Gordon Strachan made way for Tony Mowbray but was asked to take charge of the team after the latter was shown the door after an inglorious spell in charge.

After being given the job on a permanent basis in 2010, Lennon built his own side by snapping up the likes of Gary Hooper, Fraser Forster and Joe Ledley.

His side narrowly missed out to Rangers in the 2010-11 SPL yet defeated Motherwell to win the Scottish Cup that season.

The following season, Lennon, boosted by the acquisition of Victor Wanyama, finally got his hands on the title and the following term his men took the scalp of Barcelona as they qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League.

Successive league titles were added last year and this – together with another Scottish Cup in 2013 and another Champions League qualification last year.

But it appears increasingly likely that this year’s title triumph will be his last as Celtic boss.

Meantime, the Scottish Football Association has postponed Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths’ disciplinary hearing to allow police to conclude their own investigation into allegations of racist chanting.

The Celtic striker was due to face charges of bringing the game into disrepute and acting against the best interests of football on Thursday after he was filmed in a pub full of Hibernian supporters before attending the Edinburgh derby on April 27.

But Griffiths’ lawyer has now won a two-week postponement while Police Scotland conclude their own investigation.
