The former home of Bernie Madoff’s brother has been put up for auction - even though there are still signs inside which read: 'United States Marshall. No Trespassing.'

Peter Madoff's mansion has gone on the market for $4.4 million complete with white tags on every item where it has been inventoried by financial crimes investigators.

His reading glasses are on a mantelpiece, there is marmalade in the fridge and his clothes are in boxes in the closets - whilst one of his wife's artificial nails is still in the bathroom.

On the bookshelf is a volume that has a heavy irony given what happened next: 'A Code of Jewish Ethics, Volume 1: You Shall Be Holy,' by Rabbi Joseph Telushkin.

Peter Madoff was chief compliance 
officer at the firm owned by his brother and he is currently serving 10 
years in jail for lying to regulators and falsifying documents.

Like Bernie, all his assets have been forfeited and are being sold off to pay back the victims of the $65 billion Ponzi scheme.

The
listing with real estate agent Shawn Elliott makes no mention of its 
dark past and merely calls it an 'English Manor Colonial' in Old 
Westbury on Long Island, New York.

The 1935 property has five bedrooms, two garages, a gorgeous garden, a swimming pool and a tennis court out the back.

Inside
the 600-square foot living room it still looks like the home of a 
wealthy financier with crystal candlesticks, a beautiful wooden coffee 
table and books piled high such as 'Dog Painting: A Social History of 
the Dog in Art.'

Plush: The home has a long, winding driveway; a tennis court; a two-bedroom pool house surrounded by lavish gardens

Proceeds: The proceeds of the sale will go towards paying back victims of the brothers' Ponzi scheme

There are numerous paintings of dogs, antiques along the hallway, a well-stocked library and marble and gold trim throughout the ground floor.

But a closer look reveals that all is not quite what it seems - some of the paintings are missing and are just empty frames as they have been taken away to be auctioned off.

The white tags on all the items were put on when financial crimes investigators went through the whole house marking up what was inside.

It was then spruced up and the gardens landscaped to make it look attractive to buyers.

Kevin Kamrowski, a deputy United States marshal, told the New York Times: 'When dealing with a home this grandiose, the outside world can lose sight of where all these fine things come from.

'Everything in this home was obtained on the backs of other people.'

Mr Elliott said that there have been offers on the property but none have been accepted yet, although some had been curious about the Madoff history.

He said: 'The less I know about a situation, for me, the better.

'My job as the real estate broker on this is to get the victims as much money as humanly possible.'

The sale is not the first time that Madoff family assets have gone under the hammer.

During a 2010 auction of Bernie's personal belongings, one buyer paid $1,700 for a collection of his socks and underwear, including some which had been used.

A lot containing his Italianate red velvet slippers with his initials 'BLM' stitched into them went for $6,000.

Also under the hammer were offerings from Bernie's personal library which included politics satire Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them, a guide to Judaism called Chutzpah and other works titled In the Shadow of the Law, and End in Tears.

All in all more than $2 million was raised by the U.S. Marshals at the auction, which showcased items which had been seized from Bernie's New York penthouse flat.

Bernie, who is serving a 150 year sentence for his crimes, has recently complained from his prison cell that he cannot sleep at night and that he is racked by remorse.

Some $2.3 billion has been recovered for his victims by a fund administered by the Justice Department, although a separate fund has clawed back an additional $9.3 billion.
