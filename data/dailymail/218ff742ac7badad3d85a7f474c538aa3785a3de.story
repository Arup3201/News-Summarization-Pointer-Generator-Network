Holly Morrison has been indicted by a grand jury on three counts of gross sexual assault and three misdemeanor counts of endangering the welfare of a child

A 34-year-old woman has been accused of allowing her boyfriend to sexually assault a developmentally disabled 14-year-old relative, it has been reported.

Holly Morrison, of Westbrook, Maine, has been indicted by a grand jury on three counts of gross sexual assault and three misdemeanor counts of endangering the welfare of a child.

She is accused of allowing Donald Cass, a former reserve police officer, to sexually assault the girl on at least three occasions last autumn, according to court records cited by the Portland Press Herald.

Morrison, who has been released on a $500
 cash bail, is due to be arraigned in Cumberland County Unified Criminal
 Court on June 5, the paper reported

Cass, 59, of Auburn, was sentenced in February to serve four years of an eight year prison sentence, with the remaining balance suspended for a four-year probation term, after he pleaded guilty to two counts of gross sexual assault.

Police were alerted after the victim reportedly told friends and a Department of Health and Human Services worker in November last year that she had been sexually assaulted, the Bangor Daily News has reported.

A report by Westbrook Detective Steve Crocker also claimed the victim told officials Morrison insisted she get into bed with the couple, according to the Portland Press Herald.

Morrison allegedly told police she met Cass at a 'swingers' party, the Bangor Daily News reported.

The married 59-year-old is then said to have visited her for five years without his wife knowing, according to court records.

The news comes just over a week after reports of the separate and unrelated case of a convicted sex offender captured by New Jersey police after a two-decade manhunt.

A multi-state investigation and three-day stakeout ended the 23-year search for James Wade Barclay with his arrest on Saturday, April 5, the New Jersey State Police Department said.

Barclay was arrested in 1989 and pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a 10-year-old multiple times over a two-year period, but he never showed up for his sentencing hearing in September 1991. He had been on the run ever since.

Police recently learned that Barclay had created a new identity, going by the alias James Toryone and working as a trucker throughout the United States, police said.

The investigation led New Jersey police to stake out a 'Stop N Ride' parking lot in rural Pennsylvania for three days.

Barclay was spotted inside a parked tractor trailer and arrested without incident.
