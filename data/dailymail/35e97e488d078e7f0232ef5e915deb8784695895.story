Almost a century ago, patients young and old suffering from tuberculosis would be sent here to be isolated - so they could not spread their deadly infection. 

It was then abandoned due to asbestos, leaving Glenn Dale sanatorium and isolation hospital in Maryland a maze of empty corridors, abandoned wards and deserted buildings. 

It is a large facility, consisting of 23 buildings on 216 acres, that was built in 1934. The first patients admitted were mainly children from poor families in Washington D.C - but additional funding from Congress allowed them to treat adults too. 

At its peak, it housed around 500 sufferers, but after the TB epidemic had died out in the 1960s the numbers dropped - allowing staff to treat other patients with chronic illnesses.  It was then closed in 1981

These photos by Pablo Maurer show most of the morgues, wards and horrifying seclusion rooms have been overrun with ivy while the walls in the nurseries and children's rooms have been covered in graffiti.

Quarantine and exposure to sunlight and fresh air were two preferred treatments for TB - so nearly every floor has an open air breeze-way or solarium. However, the floors are still covered with debris and most of the windows have been smashed. 

Legend has it that the grounds around the building have been haunted by the Goat Man of Maryland. Witnesses allege they have seen the creature - who is half-man half-goat - sprinting through the woodland.  

An auditorium in the abandoned Glenn Dale Hospital in Maryland, that was used for presentations and training classes, languishes on the second floor of the Adult building. Old fittings and paper still cover the floor more than 30 years after the site was vacated 

Ivy has overtaken much of the second floor in the children's building. Most of the buildings are characterized by broken glass, peeling paint, corroded walls and overgrown vines. Several of the buildings also have collapsed roofs

The empty corridors of the abandoned Glenn Dale Hospital in Maryland have been left covered in dust while the walls have been stripped of their paint 

At its peak, the isolation hospital 15 miles outside of Washington D.C. housed around 500 sufferers, but after the TB epidemic had died out in the 1960s the numbers dropped - allowing staff to treat other patients with chronic illnesses

A ladder is stowed away where the trays of the morgue used to be located. Patients would be taken to the sanatorium to be isolated and would often die alone 

Specimen cups sit a draw on one of the empty wards. It is surrounded by broken pieces from the ceiling and debris 

The end of the corridor in this ward descends into total darkness. The facility initially admitted children when it opened in 1934, but would eventually treat adults 

Banks of old, rusting pressing equipment are still kept in the laundry, the walls of which are now adorned with graffiti 

The word 'Satan' is written in imposing letters on the brick wall through this haunting entrance. When antibiotics were introduced to help combat TB in the 1960s, patients with other chronic illnesses started to be admitted

An enormous dryer still sits in the empty laundry. The huge machine would have dealt with clothes from the 150 adult and child patients housed in the facility 

A spray-painted red arrow points down into the laundry chute. The photos by Pablo Maurer reveal how some of the machinary is still intact decades after it was vacated

A creepy corridor in one of the old wards is lined with broken doors, graffiti and peeling paint. Quarantine and exposure to sunlight and fresh air were two preferred treatments for TB, and you can see that in the design of both of the hospital wards at Glenn Dale. Nearly every floor has an open air breeze-way or solarium

An old urinal has withered away with rust while the bars on a window have been broken - giving a better view of the surrounding woodland 

This station would have been bustling with nurses during the day as they swapped paper work and assigned patients during their shifts 

One of the largest features of the abandoned site is the water tower. The main container has been left to rust over time 

The paint from the walls surrounding this window have been gradually chipped over. The branches outside have shed their leaves leaving a haunting image 

A corridor in an old ward is covered in old clothes and bits of paper, while the water tower stands over the road leading to the entrance of Glenn Dale 

Pins are still stuck in the noticeboard at one of the old nurses' stations. Pieces of wall have come away from around the opening

Parts of the buildings are covered in icicles and frozen puddles with the empty corridors, rooms and wards being left vulnerable to wintry conditions 

A 'Troy Minute-Man, Jr. Tumbler' has been left in the laundry room. It is one of the huge items of machinary that have been abandoned at the site 

Most of the windows of the children's ward have been smashed. The wooden structures on the roof identify where the playground would have been. They went to play on the top floor of the building so they would be exposed to the most sunlight 

The superintendent in charge of the hospital would have lived in this house which is fronted by white wooden paneling 

This large house is where the resident doctor would have lived. It is secluded from the rest of the hospital and comes with a porch and huge garden 

Two birds are sat perched on a window of one of the buildings. Most of the panes of glass on the red-brick facade are still in tact 

A disused elevator is now covered in spray paint while glass from an old piece of laundry machinary has been smashed 

Large swathes of grass surround the abandoned buildings which were completed in the 1930s - allowing patients from Washington D.C. to receive treatment 

Green paint from around a light has begun to crack but is mostly still in tact. The Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission Park Police now patrol the hospital grounds regularly

A panorama shows the beaten down exterior of the adult's building. Most of the walls are now covered in graffiti 

An ominous sign spray-painted onto the wall of one of the buildings could be telling potential intruders to turn around 

Another nurses station is surrounded by debris and wood that has gradually faded away  over time. One thing that does remain intact is the metal worktop 

A window at the end of one of the graffiti-covered corridors lets in light from the outside
