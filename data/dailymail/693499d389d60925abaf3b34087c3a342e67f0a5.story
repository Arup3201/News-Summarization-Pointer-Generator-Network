Maine State Police say a firefighter from Florida who was missing in Maine was the victim of a drug-related murder.

Police charged 24-year-old Daniel 
Porter of Bangor on Tuesday in the death of Jerry Perdomo of Orange 
City, Florida, who has been missing since Feb. 16.

The arrest was made at a home in Jackson, Maine which was rented by Porter's father.

Missing father-of-two: Jerry Perdomo, 31, of Orange City, Florida, was last seen at a rural home in Jackson, Maine, earlier this month on February 16

Spokesman Steve McCausland of the 
Maine Public Safety Department says it was a drug-related homicide, but 
he said further details would be spelled out as early as Wednesday in 
court documents.

Mr McCausland also said the body of 
31-year-old Mr Perdomo has not been found, but he would not elaborate on
what efforts are under way to locate it.

During the investigation, neighbors said that the accused and his family were big partiers.

Don Leino, who lives next door to the 
Maine home of Porter, told BangorDailyNews that his neighbours are 
'related to half of Waldo County'.

'They just work all week and get crazy
as hell on the weekends,’ Mr Leino said. ‘They party pretty hard, I 
think. But it’s a nice place to live.

'These guys have never caused anybody on this road any trouble.'

'Danny lived there (at his father's 
home) but he’s with his girlfriend most of the time, he comes and goes,'
neighbour Joan Leino added to WOFL.

Mr Perdomo, a father-of-two, went 
missing after he drove the 1,500 miles from Florida to Maine to visit 
with friends, though the exact connection between he and Porter and 
Porter’s  girlfriend Cheyanne Nowak is unknown.

The pair were tracked down in Connecticut in the past week and interviewed by police before returning to Maine.

A woman calling herself 'Lisa' last 
week told a local TV station that the fireman had been staying with her 
up until the night of his disappearance.

She claimed Mr Perdomo had been travelling to Maine from Florida to visit her every month for ten months.

The claims of a girlfriend complicate matters as well, as Mr Perdomo was reported missing by his wife in Florida.

She called her husband 'a dedicated dad. He helps people out a lot.'

'He was always doing something for 
somebody,' Tonya Perdomo said, adding: 'He had friends from all over so 
it wouldn't be unusual for him to go out of town.'

Authorities were drilling through ice 
and snow and diving underwater in wet suits near the home in Jackson as 
they continue searching.

Investigators have impounded three 
vehicles, including Mr Perdomo's rental car found abandoned in a 
Wal-Mart car park in Bangor, Maine.

Probe: Police named Daniel Porter (right) as a person of interest. It is believed he was the last person to see Perdomo, along with girlfriend Cheyanne Nowak (left)

‘We applaud them for their resources, 
their efforts and everything that they’re doing,’ a fire spokesman told 
Fox affiliate WOFL.

Some of Mr Perdomo's firefighter colleagues in Seminole County have travelled up to Maine to help authorities in their search.

'We are moving forward and are going 
to continue placing missing person posters up in areas where he might 
have been,’ a fire spokesman said.

Even after the arrest of Porter, Mr Perdomo’s friends and family are left with many questions and few answers.

'Never in a million years would I 
think I'd be hanging up missing posters of my brother,' his sister Skye 
Ramos told ABC News. 'How can you sleep?'
