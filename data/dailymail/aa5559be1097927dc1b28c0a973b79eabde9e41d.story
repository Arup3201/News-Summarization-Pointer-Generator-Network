David Cameron and Nick Clegg will fly to Spain today for summer holidays – leaving  William Hague as the most senior minister in the country.

The Prime Minister will be away for around ten days, returning to Britain towards the end of next week for a couple of days before returning to Spain.

He will then come back to  Britain in time for the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games on August 29.

Waving goodbye to London: Both David Cameron and Nick Clegg depart from the UK for their annual holidays tomorrow despite recent economic figures which show the country's economy is still struggling

After a few days of Paralympic events,
Mr Cameron, his wife Samantha and their three children will then visit 
Cornwall for a short break.

Mr Clegg is spending two weeks in the 
Spanish town of Olmedo, where his wife Miriam González Durantez grew up 
and her family still lives.

They will be accompanied by their three 
children.

Left incharge: The departure of David Cameron and Nick Clegg means the most senior minister remaining in the UK will be Foreign Secretary William Hague

No 10 officials insist Mr Cameron will
stay in charge and will be accompanied by a fully working office, 
security officials and secure communications.

They would say only that he is  heading to the Mediterranean but it is understood that he is also visiting a Spanish location.

Mr Cameron took umbrage at questions 
about his time off, saying: ‘If you don’t think politicians ought to 
have holidays I think you ought to have a serious think.’

Labour leader 
Ed Miliband will spend two weeks on a Greek island with his wife, 
Justine Thornton, and their sons Daniel and Samuel.

A rota of senior ministers has been 
worked out to avoid the claims made in previous years that there is no 
one leading in London.

The Foreign Secretary will be the senior minister
in Westminster for most of the next fortnight, with Home Secretary 
Theresa May taking over for a couple of days next week.

The Prime Minister has said it 
cannot be assumed Boris Johnson will succeed him as Tory leader, adding
