A group of around 50 homeless people evacuated a camp set up behind some bushes and trees in Fort Worth where they built meager homes in which to live.

After numerous complaints from neighboring residents about the impoverished group's decision to camp on private property, the city destroyed the campsite on Saturday and the inhabitants left.

Town officials previously expressed the desire to eradicate prostitution and drug problems in the area that may be worsened by homelessness, reports the Star Telegram.

David Miller told The Star Telegram that he will have to move the small home he built for himself that includes a bedroom, a closet space, windows, and a fluffy white cat named Chamuka.

'I just go by what they say,' Miller said of the city’s plans.

'I know of places I can go. That’s why I’m not really worried. I’m not worried at all. I’ll go somewhere. I’m not going to go too far when I go — no further than what I can carry in a couple bags of clothes without getting too tired.'

The city gave the homeless residents verbal notice that they needed to leave six weeks ago.

They also offered some help by bringing in aid to connect the people with programs and shelters, Brandon Bennett, the city’s director of code compliance, told the Star Telegram.

Amy Bernoski Ebnet, founder of a nonprofit called Rita's Hope said that destroying camps merely moves homeless people instead of addressing then problem of homelessness.

'What is going to happen on March 28, of moving the property these individuals have and putting it in dumpsters and then giving them nowhere to go, is not a solution to homelessness. That just continues to move a problem,' Ebnet said.

'And when I say moving them, I don’t mean relocating them. I mean knocking over their stuff and having them go find somewhere else to live.'

Brandon Bennett, the city’s director of code compliance said the living outdoors is not the bestc solution for the homeless population.

'We are pushing these folks toward the services and the lifestyle that will break the chains that will get them out of homelessness,' Bennett said, adding that they are 'managing' the problem, not moving it.

'I was down there and watched a young girl exchange sex for money — prostitution is not a way out of homelessness. We are going down there and people are doing drugs and drinking — that is not a way out of homelessness,' Bennett said. 

'They are not getting the medical services they need to have a healthy lifestyle — that is not getting out of homelessness.'

Bennett said in some ways that the property owner is the victim when homeless people set up camp because he had to pay for part of the destruction.

'To a big degree, he is a victim,' Bennett said. 

'These people trespassed on his property, littered on his property and destroyed parts of property. I’m sorry they are homeless, but there are a lot of services available to these folks, and I encourage them to take part in the process.'

Fort Worth cleans up about 100 camps a year and the city cleans around 68,000 pounds of trash from the campsites. Residents are given a few days to claim their belongings.
