The Luzhniki Stadium, May 21, 2008: as Chelsea and Manchester United’s players are hit by a wall of sound as they emerge for the Champions League final, a young coach is dreaming.

All around, flashbulbs are popping as cameras capture images of the players who are about to contest the greatest game in club football. Gleaming on a platform in the distance is that unmistakable trophy, the one that defines careers.

At that moment, Brendan Rodgers — youth coach under Chelsea manager Avram Grant — knew his life’s ambition.

‘I remember walking out of the tunnel when the teams were coming out,’ says Liverpool’s manager. ‘I was behind them and I was picturing myself as the manager in a Champions League final. I was wondering what it might be like.

‘With all the experiences of games in that period, they all helped me because in my mind I was looking at the game and making decisions as a manager. To arrive and be at that level is great.

‘When we were walking out in Moscow, I was framing the mindset that one day — if this was to happen to me — then I will have been here before. Hopefully, it is something that becomes real.’ 

Rodgers is not suggesting that he envisages that dream coming true in Berlin’s Olympic Stadium next June but, for now, to lead Liverpool in the competition after a five-year absence is a step in the right direction.

When he arrived at Anfield two years ago, Rodgers’ mission was to get Liverpool back in the Champions League but it is only in the past two days, as he prepared for Tuesday night’s tussle with Bulgaria’s FC Ludogorets, that he has truly appreciated the significance.

This, after all, is the tournament that enchants the five-time winners like no other. The Kop sings about Rome, Wembley, Paris and Istanbul at every home game and they gleefully recall games against Inter Milan (1965), St Etienne (1977) and Chelsea (2005) that span generations.

History, however, needs updating and Rodgers sees this as a chance for his young squad to start writing their own chapter. With European champions Real Madrid also in Group B, another famous Anfield night may be just around the corner.

‘It hits home as soon as you actually see ourselves back in the Champions League how much it can actually be missed,’ says Rodgers. ‘I looked at the footballs (with the Champions League logos) at Melwood the other day. Little simple touches like that let you know this is where this club has to be.

‘It’s something I have really wanted to experience as a coach. At 41 — to be able to get the chance — it’s really young but it’s something I’m looking forward to.’

Rodgers is likely to keep faith with the vast majority of the side that lost 1-0 to Aston Villa on Saturday, meaning the midfield axis will be Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson — captain alongside vice-captain.

Henderson has been elevated to this position as reward for the progress he has made since Rodgers has been at the club. As Henderson prepares to take another significant step forward, Rodgers believes the same is true of Liverpool as a club.

‘Jordan is someone who represents a lot of what we are about,’ said Rodgers.

‘He and Stevie are the moral compass of our group: how they conduct themselves on and off the field, how they train, how they work.

‘You see now for club and country he (Henderson) holds himself really well, he’s got a great stature and I think he will be around here for years to come.’

Sentiments which Rodgers hopes will be true of Liverpool in the Champions League.
