A Border Agency employee stunned his bosses with bizarre resignation letter iced on to a cake.

Chris Holmes, 31, who worked at Stansted Airport, tweeted a picture of the note to resign from his job and pursue his dream to run a bakery business.

Mr Homes said: 'I handed in the cake in person to the duty manager. I think he was pleasantly surprised.

Chris Holmes penned his resignation letter to the UK Border Agency at Stansted Airport on a homemade cake.

'It was a passion cake - a carrot cake made with coconut, pecans, sultanas and orange buttercream.

'The lettering was a bit tricky because there were so many words and was quite fiddly.

The resignation seemed like the natural choice for a cakemaker with a whimsical sense of humour.

'I thought it was a good natured resignation and hopefully left a nice taste in their mouths.

'I’d been planning it for six-months but kept it to myself because I wasn’t sure when I would be leaving.'

Icing on the cake: Chris Holmes (pictured) had previously worked at the UK Border Agency for 7 years but has now decided to focus on spending time with his family

'I’d been working with the UK Border Agency for around seven years and set up the cake business in July 2010.

'I decided that my passion lies with food and wanted to spend more time at home with my son Ben.'

The former civil servant stunned employees by adding a touching message to the confectionery.

He wrote: ‘Having recently become a 
father I now realise how precious life is and how important it is to 
spend my time doing something that makes me and other people happy.

‘For that reason I hereby give 
notice of my resignation, in order that I may devote my time and energy 
to my family, and to my cake business which has grown steadily over the 
past few years.

‘I wish the organisation and my colleagues the best for the future .

’The picture of the ‘resignation cake’ came to light when it was tweeted by his relative Stuart Jackson.

He tweeted: 'So, my brother-in-law has resigned from his 9-to-5 job in spectacular fashion. Jerry Maguire meets Masterchef.'

Bill
Form, Border Force Assistant Director at Stansted, said: 'Chris handed 
in the cake, along with a more formal letter, yesterday. He leaves with 
our very best wishes and we wish him well for the future.

To The Management,Border Force, Stansted:

Today is my 31st birthday, and having recently become a father I now realise have precious life is and how important it is to spend my time doing something that makes me, and other people, happy.

For that reason I hereby give notice of my resignation, in order that I may devote my time and energy to my family, and to my cake business which has grown steadily over the past few years.

I wish the organisation and my colleagues the best for the future and I remind you that, if you enjoy this cake, you can order more at www.mrcake.co.uk
