When I finally reach Dave and Sue Donaldson’s home, or what is left of it, their severely disabled teenage son has just been rescued from his downstairs bedroom by emergency crews.

Lashed by wind, rain and relentless floodwaters, their house in Burrowbridge is accessible only by a narrow canal path running along the back of the garden.

It is becoming increasingly treacherous: anyone walking along it risks being blown into the churning water by the wind.

Marooned by water: Dave and Sue Donaldson with their daughter Heather, 12, at the flooded home in Burrowbridge, Somerset

The front of the house is cut off – marooned in an ocean of water stretching as far as the eye can see. This is the Somerset Levels, but you may as well be standing on Blackpool pier.

A set of huge pumps, like cannons, fire water in terrifying blasts from the flooded plains in front of the Donaldsons’ house into the canal behind them, which in turn is rising inexorably, threatening homes on both sides.

Standing ankle-deep in water in the downstairs bedroom of the Donaldsons’ 17-year-old son, Luke – where his now empty mechanised bed stands on pallets – is like being on board a sinking cruise ship.

It took fire crews with special lifting equipment and a flood emergency truck several hours to take Luke, who is severely brain damaged and in a wheelchair, to safety. After a sudden surge of water last week, the police came on Friday to tell the family to evacuate.

When I arrive, Mrs Donaldson is packing the family’s belongings. She plans to follow her son and 12-year-old daughter Heather, who are staying nearby in a special centre for disabled people. Dave, 49, a builder, is adamant he is staying behind.

He has heard that looters have been active – they have already targeted a nearby farm – and is worried about break-ins.

Mrs Donaldson, 48, looks ashen with stress and fatigue as she packs boxes. The carpets are rolled up in bundles. Most of the family’s furniture has been taken upstairs.

All around the Donaldson smallholding in Burrowbridge it looks weirdly like a seaside village. Waves rush across the flooded fields driven by 80mph winds. In one of their paddocks, the water line is just a few feet from two pet pigs, Mary and Billy.

Most of their animals – two ponies, a goat, some sheep and chickens – have been moved further afield. But the pigs belong to a friend who brought them here when she was forced out of her flooded home in nearby Moorland. The family are anxious about moving them again because they are deaf and blind.

Their owner, Shirley Armitage, is sitting on the sodden ground feeding her beloved pot-bellies digestive biscuits. It is a sorry sight.

Mrs Armitage, 56, and her 85-year-old father, Walter Richards, have been evacuated from their house. ‘It’s a nightmare,’ she says, hugging Mary with tears in her eyes. Mr Donaldson is angry about what he sees as the cause of all this: ‘Three words: Dredge the rivers.’

He is particularly furious about the inaction of the Environment Agency. ‘What they have concentrated on is wildlife and birds. They have encouraged farmers to keep the fields fallow to create wetlands.

'They have diverted money from dredging and spent it on wildlife sanctuaries. The Environment Agency sees humans as a bloody nuisance.’ It is a story you hear everywhere you go.

A few miles down the lane in Bere Aller – a village of a few hundreds souls – you come to Charity Farm, for now just above the level of the flood waters. It is aptly named because the farmer here, Barrie Bryer, has been helping to move farmers’ cattle from flooded barns.

In his kitchen, Mr Bryer takes out a map and points to the place – a spot called Dunball – where he told the Environment Agency to install pumps to clear a clogged-up section of the River Parrett.

‘It’s no good being angry,’ says his wife Rosemary, ‘but my husband has been telling them we need pumps at Dunball for 20 years.’

Saturated: Farms have also been devastated by the extensive flooding

People like this feel they understand the Somerset landscape and how it works – but that they have been ignored by those in authority.

As night falls in Burrowbridge, rescue boats motor through the flooded plains carrying sandbags, and police officers knock on doors to check on those who haven’t yet left. The huge set of pumps are still roaring away, and in the few hours I’ve been here, the water in the canal has crept up several inches.

David and Marilyn Gillard are stuck in the middle of the deep floodwaters. At some point in the next few hours, Mrs Gillard, 63, will be taken out by rescue crews. But Mr Gillard, 69, is staying because he has a thousand sheep in barns, some of whom have started lambing.

The family is being incredibly brave, but they repeat what is becoming a familiar refrain. ‘We asked the Environment Agency last summer why they weren’t dredging the river,’ says Mrs Gillard, ‘and they said they couldn’t because there were voles – and voles are protected.’

She smiles a grim smile. It is a good job people here are so stoic or there would be a riot.

People here have pulled together with a Blitz spirit that is nothing short of heroic. In a courageous attempt to carry on as normal, mothers canoed their children to school – but had to stop because there is raw sewage in the water.

In a cottage with sandbags at the door, right by the canal that looks about to burst its banks, Tom Douglas, 30, a youth justice worker, offers to make us tea and says: ‘You know what, the spirit here is Churchillian.’

A cup of tea may not be much in the grand scheme of things, but the formidable – though increasingly despairing – people of the Somerset Levels are coming to understand that small human gestures mean a great deal when your life is being turned upside down.
