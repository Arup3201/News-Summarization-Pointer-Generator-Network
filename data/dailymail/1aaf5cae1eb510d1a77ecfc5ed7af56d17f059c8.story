Valeria Lukyanova said she was attacked outside her home in Odessa, Ukraine on Halloween night 

The model was hospitalised following the attack when two men jumped out at her as she returned home 

She was punched her in the head and several times on the jaw before attempting to strangle her

She said: 'I was attacked by the entrance of my block of flats.'

'I came back home from a shop with bags and entered the door code when two men rushed from the dark and attacked me.

'They said nothing and did not try to rob me.

'It happened in a flash, they hit me on the head, several times on my jaw, then one of them began strangling me.

'If it wasn't for my neighbour who who suddenly appeared, I don't know what would have happened. They saw her and ran away.'

She said the attack was on Halloween night and she was hospitalised until being released yesterday.

Valeria said she had been receiving anonymous threats over the past two years 

She said: 'I feel a little better, but my jaw is still hurting badly.

'I have been on the strongest pain killer for four days, but still woke in the middle of the night from horrible pains.'

She claimed she had received threats for two years, with 'strangers' calling her phone and menacing her.

Lukyanova has frequently insisted that a boob job is her only plastic surgery.

'All genetics came to me from nature, except my breasts,' she said.

'I lost weight and, unfortunately, I have a very small breasts. I had to increase my size to feel like a normal girl. But I didn't subject myself to any other plastic surgery.'

Lukyanova recently said she wanted to alter her look from Ukrainian Barbie to Amazon Woman 

Following the attack Lukyanova said she no longer likes her body claiming 'it needs some muscle' 

Recently the Ukrainian Barbie said she wanted to turn into Amazon Woman in a change of image after admiring a mystical female warrior role model.

She said she admired the all-female warriors from Greek mythology. 'She had a beautiful and warlike figure, the body of an Amazon.

'I want the same magnificent figure. I no longer like my body.

'It needs some muscle.'

She also revealed an ambition to star in a movie with British star Callum Blue.

'He is awesome, a divine actor. I hope someday I will succeed.'
