Michele Bachmann has long insisted that she won’t use a teleprompter in the event of her becoming U.S. President.

So it’s something of a surprise that she was seen at a campaign stop in Creston, Iowa, reading a prepared speech from an Apple iPad.

‘I have a statement I would like to read before I open up and take a few of your questions,’ the Minnesota Representative read from her tablet.

In the past she has mocked Barack Obama’s use of teleprompters and promised there will be ‘no teleprompters in the Bachmann White House’.

But she used the iPad during a five-minute speech on Wednesday that was interrupted by a noisy train, to which she replied: ‘Good morning’.

Mrs Bachmann, 55, told a crowd about a recent advert attack on her by Republican rival and Texas Governor Rick Perry, reported Raw Story.

She also spoke about President Obama’s healthcare laws and talked about the dangers of North Korea, Iran and nuclear technology.

Mrs Bachmann is currently sixth in the GOP Iowa rankings, according to a new NBC poll that put her on six per cent - only ahead of Jon Huntsman.

Iowans get voting next Tuesday, with Mitt Romney currently leading the NBC poll with 23 per cent, followed by Ron Paul on 21 per cent.

She mocked President Obama’s use of teleprompters in August, saying: ‘I forgot something, I just feel sick about it. I forgot my teleprompters.’

And one month before then she told a crowd: ‘President O'Bach - President Bachmann will not have teleprompters in the White House.’
