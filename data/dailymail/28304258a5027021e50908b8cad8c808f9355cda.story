Old Navy is at the center of yet another controversy regarding its treatment of plus size customers. 

Just six weeks after the retailer was forced to defend its decision to charge its female shoppers more money for larger sizes, a plus size customer on Reddit has slammed the store for making its online plus size menu option twice the size of every other menu. 

'Thanks for reminding me that I take up enough space for two categories, Old Navy,' user iChasedragons commented alongside an image of the offending menu, which seems to only appear on the brand's Canadian website.

'Thanks Old Navy': Reddit user iChasedragons said that the menu layout on the brand's Canadian website was a cruel reminder that she 'takes up enough space for two categories'

The menu shows the different clothing categories offered in the online store, each of which feature an image of a model showcasing one of the store's chosen fashion looks. 

However under the 'Women' and 'Men' options, which sit aside one another, the 'Women's Plus' link sits astride two columns, a layout which - once pointed out - has caused outrage with a number of other Reddit users. 

Many users have gone on to question why the Women's Plus category requires its own menu option in the first place, when the men's plus size selection - Big and Tall - is just included in the main menswear category.

'The weird part is, Old Navy DOES have a Big and Tall selection in their men's clothing, but you don't really see it until you click on the item you want to buy,' user lilfunky1 pointed out. 

'But the women's stuff is separated out as a whole new category of Women's Plus.'

According to one beady-eyed user, the reason for the bizarre menu layout is that the Canadian version of the website doesn't appear to offer a maternity section for women - the category which sits alongside Women's Plus on the main US site. 

'[The Canandian site] don't have a Maternity category for some reason,' arnaudh explained. 

The smaller the size, the smaller the price: Old Navy's popular Rockstar Super Skinny Jeans are $34.94 if bought in sizes 0 to 20

Unfair increase: Any women who buy a pair of the Rockstar Super Skinny Jeans in a plus size fit will be charged an additional $10, bringing the total price up to $44.94

'If you go to the US version, it doesn't display that way because of the additional category.

starmartyr added: 'Why wouldn't they have a Maternity section in Canada? Does Old Navy believe that Canadians are hatched from eggs?' 

In November, New York-based merchandiser Renee Posey called for Old Navy to scrap its 'discriminatory' plus size up-charges, saying that the discrepancy between the prices for larger men and women is nothing other than 'straight up fat shaming'.

And while the store insisted that 'unique fabrics and design elements' were to blame for its female customers being charged more money for larger sizes - while the menswear designs remain the same price regardless of size - Ms Posey insisted that the explanation wasn't good enough.

'Plus size women like myself are kind of fed up with being treated like second-class citizens by retailers,' the 34-year-old told Today.com. 'I think it's reached critical mass and people are ready for a change.'

After Ms Posey started a petition on Change.org, calling for the brand to change their gender-biased price policies, a spokeswoman for Gap Inc, Old Navy's parent company, released a statement blaming the increased costs for plus-size womenswear on the fact that the larger designs require additional details not found in the smaller sizes

Fighting for change: Ms Posey's petition was signed by more than 33,000 people in a matter of days

'For women, styles are not just larger sizes of other women’s items, they are created by a team of designers who are experts in creating the most flattering and on-trend plus styles, which includes curve-enhancing and curve-flattering elements such as four-way stretch materials and contoured waistbands, which most men's garments do not include,' spokeswoman Debbie Felix explained. 

'This higher price point reflects the selection of unique fabrics and design elements.' 

But Ms Posey insisted that the statement did not address why there is not a single increase for any of the larger menswear designs, particularly as they also require the use of additional materials.

'Every woman knows how hard it is to find a good pair of jeans: a pair that is the right fit at the right price,' she wrote on the petition. 'That’s why I was shocked when, during a recent visit to Old Navy’s website, I noticed that they were charging $12-$15 more for plus-sized women's jeans - but not up-charging jeans for “big” men. 

'If they are charging plus-sized women more to cover the cost of the fabric being used, then why aren’t they doing the same for men?' 

According to the prices on the Old Navy website at the time of publication, the same differences in price between the plus size styles and the regular styles are still in effect.
