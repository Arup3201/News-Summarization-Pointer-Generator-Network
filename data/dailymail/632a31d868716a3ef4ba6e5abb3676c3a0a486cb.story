A pair of long-serving work colleagues who met on their first day as trainee scientists are to retire from the same hospital on the same day 40 years later.

Lynda Elmore and Sharon Battersby met as trainee biomedical scientists at Tameside hospital in Greater Manchester on September 15, 1969.

They went on to become best friends, bridesmaids for each other and the mothers-of-two are also godparents to each other's children.

Long time friends Lynda Elmore and Sharon Battersby are due to retire on the same day, four decades after they first met

Now the pair, who retire today, plan to celebrate by going on holiday together.

Lynda, 60, said: 'Our friendship started in work and over the years we've become closer and closer, I would say we are best friends.

'Some people say we are more like sisters, we are very much family.

'I think we will both miss work but it's a new beginning.

'We'll probably spend even more time together now as ladies who lunch!'

Lynda, from Saddleworth, Greater Manchester, is married to Grahame, who will join her on the trip with Sharon and husband Allen on a cruise to see the Northern Lights.

The pals are also planning to spend some of their free time on walking holidays in the Lake District.

Sharon, 59, who lives in Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, said: 'Our respective partners have obviously got to know each other and get on very well.

'You have a lot of acquaintances but very few true friends like Lynda. I

'have no brothers and sisters so in many ways she is like a sister.'

The friends both work in the hospital's pathology department, Lynda in microbiology and Sharon in the blood transfusion unit.

David Wilkinson, director of human resources, added: 'This is an amazing story of two excellent members of staff.

Both Lynda and Sharon have shown incredible dedication and commitment to the trust.

'It is people like Lynda and Sharon who make the hospital one of the best employers in the area.

'Everyone wishes them all the best for their retirement.'

Great servants: David Wilkinson, from Tamside Hospital in Greater Manchester, said both women had show 'great dedication'
