'Honeytrap': British professor Paul Frampton

A British scientist held in an 
Argentine jail on suspicion of drug smuggling claims he is the victim of
a honey trap after being duped into believing he was starting a new 
life with a Czech glamour model.

Professor Paul Frampton was arrested in Buenos Aires after two kilos of cocaine were found in a suitcase he was carrying.

The academic insists he thought the 
case belonged to Denise Milani – an underwear model  who won the Miss 
Bikini World title in 2007.

The 68-year-old professor said he had been exchanging messages with someone he thought was the model on a dating website.

After three months of correspondence, 
Professor Frampton, who was teaching at the University of North 
Carolina, agreed to meet his online ‘girlfriend’ in Bolivia before 
flying back to the US to start a new life with her.

But when no one turned up after ten days, he claims he was persuaded to travel to Argentina to catch up with her there instead.

Despite being stood up a second time, 
the professor says he agreed to carry a case he was told belonged to the
model to Brussels. Days later he was arrested.

Prof Frampton believed he was chatting to bikini model Denise Milani, but it turned out to be a fraud

After languishing for six months in 
jail, the Oxford graduate says he now believes the mafia tricked him 
into carrying the drugs by posing as Miss Milani.

The divorcee, who is described as 
‘naive’ by his ex-wife, said: ‘Perhaps I should have realised earlier 
but the fraudster was very good and very intelligent.

‘I never thought these sorts of people existed. For 11 weeks I thought I was chatting with an attractive woman.’

The professor claims he was given the 
suitcase at a hotel in Buenos Aires by an Hispanic-looking middle-aged 
man who told him it belonged to the 32-year-old model.

The person Prof Frampton claims to have been deceived by was using model Milani's pictures to con him

He told an 
Argentine newspaper he planned to take the case to Brussels for a new 
meeting with his ‘girlfriend’ but changed his mind and was arrested as 
he tried to board a plane to Peru.

There is no suggestion the model had 
any involvement in the drugs smuggling plot – or knew the mafia was 
allegedly using her identity.

Professor Frampton, who is suffering 
from lung problems following his enforced stay in prison, added: ‘The 
person I thought was this woman told me she liked older men and was 
tired of doing photo sessions.

‘I fell for the story. Before my 
arrest on January 23 I was convinced I was chatting with a “her” and 
after a couple of weeks in prison, I realised it was a man, a criminal 
posing as this model.

‘“She” asked me if I could be proud of someone like “her”. It was quite convincing.

‘I found out I wasn’t going to meet 
her in Bolivia as planned the day I got there. I should have returned to
the States right then.

‘But I always complete my plans, the same way I complete my physics papers. She was my project.’

The professor, who was born in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, is being held at Villa Devoto Prison in Buenos Aires.

Leading academics including 1979 Nobel
prizewinner Sheldon Glashow, who has worked on more than a dozen 
scientific papers with Professor Frampton, have written to the judge in 
his case to plead his innocence.
