This is the heart-stopping moment a cyclist cheated death by inches after being run over by a lorry.

The rider, astonishingly escaped with just minor cuts and bruises after every wheel of the heavy goods vehicle missed him by the narrowest of margins.

The impact, which police said happened after the lorry driver  failed to spot the cyclist as he made a right hand turn, was captured on CCTV.

In the hair-raising footage, obtained by ITN, the lorry  plows into the rider before knocking him forward off his bike.
