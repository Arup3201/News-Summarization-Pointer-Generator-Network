The new Premier League season is nearly upon us and BT Sport have already made their move to stand out from the crowd with a gigantic selfie of their main football pundits.

The picture, taken at BT Towers, included the likes of former Manchester United trio Rio Ferdinand, Michael Owen and Paul Scholes, all of whom were pictured together for the first time for the company.

Ferdinand will feature far less frequent than the likes of retired duo Owen and Scholes though, as he continues his playing career with newly-promoted QPR.

Competitor: BT Sport will face stiff competition from BBC Sport this season

The selfie, which included many others who work for the company, was taken by BT Sport presenter Jake Humphrey.

With huge competitors in the shape of BBC Sport and Sky Sports, the addition of Manchester United legend Scholes will come as a huge boost to the company as they embark on their second full season since being formed.

BBC Sport's exceptional coverage of the World Cup in Brazil has no doubt prompted BT into action, and the arrival of Scholes could well be a similar one to when Gary Neville first joined Sky.

Busy man: Ferdinand will combine his two punditry roles for BT Sport and BBC Sport with his player role at QPR

Well-respected: Scholes was an outstanding asset on the pitch and will look to be the exact same off it too

BT Sport will be looking to follow-up on a encouraging first season, with the channel still free for any BT Broadband customers.

They still find themselves quite a way behind Sky Sports in particular though, but do hope to pip them to the right to screen Spanish football from next season with a new La Liga contract up for graps.

With highly-respected and high-profile figures like Ferdinand and Scholes continuing their work for the company the future can only be bright for BT Sport.
