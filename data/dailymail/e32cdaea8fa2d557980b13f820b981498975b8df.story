Arrest: Gordon Collins-Faunce told police he picked up his baby son by
his head and threw him in a chair when he became overwhelmed caring for
him

A two-month-old boy has died from brain injuries after his father allegedly lifted him by the head in a fit of rage and threw him into a chair, causing his neck to snap backwards.

The tragedy comes after health services had already been warned about injuries to Gordon Collins-Faunce's three-year-old daughter after she had come to school covered in bruises.

Collins-Faunce, 23, told police he 'was losing control' as he cared for baby Ethan, his twin brother Lucas and his older half sister at their home in Arundel, Maine.

After his fianc√©e, 23-year-old Christina Henderson, left for work at 9.30 a.m., he went outside for a cigarette and returned to find Ethan and his sister crying, the Portland Press Herald reported.

He admitted he was overwhelmed and pick the baby up from the floor by his head, holding him so the baby's feet dangled as high as his chest.

'He said he stood up straight and held [Ethan] by the head with both hands for "one minute max",' the police affidavit said.

He then hurled Ethan into a chair in the living room, seeing the boy's head snap back as he landed. 'On a scale of 1-10, he estimated 
his force to be 8 or 9,' the affidavit read.

Collins-Faunce originally told police he had found the baby struggling to breathe and gurgling at the mouth as he laid in his crib. He said the boy's eyes were barely open and he had 'lockjaw'.

The father said he handed the boy to his stepmother and called 911. An ambulance took Ethan to Southern 
Maine Medical Center, then transferred to the Special Care 
Unit at Maine Medical Center.

Victim: Baby Ethan sustained severe brain damage and died three days later. His father also admitted he had previously broken his arm when he became stressed while changing his diaper

Doctors found Ethan had severe bleeding around the brain and had no activity on the left side. He was taken off life support and died shortly after midnight on Tuesday, three days after the attack.

Police arrested Collins-Faunce after the alleged incident and charged him with assault. Now the state Attorney General's Office will decide what new charges could be brought in light of the death.

Charges could include manslaughter or depraved indifference murder, which is
conduct 'so heinous that it shows a total disregard for the value 
of human life,' Deputy Attorney General William Stokes told the Press Herald.

Ethan had allegedly suffered at the hands of his father before, yet it is not clear if child protective services were made aware of these, or if they provided a response.

Family: Collins-Faunce is pictured with his fiancee Christina Henderson, her three-year-old daughter and their twin sons Ethan and Lucas. A family friend said she believed the father picked on Ethan

Collins-Faunce told police he had broken Ethan's arm when he was four-weeks old after twisting it on purpose when he became frustrated while changing his diaper.

At first he had said the injury was an accident after the boy's arm had become stuck between the crib and its protective bumper as he lifted him.

Doctors also said Ethan, whom they described as a 'dirty child' with nappy rash and an unwashed belly button, had older brain injuries.

In addition, the state Department of Health and Human 
Services were contacted by Ethan's sister's daycare, claiming the three-year-old girl had arrived covered with bruises.

The affidavit does not indicate whether the DHHS investigated. A DHHS spokesperson said he could not comment on individual cases due to confidentiality laws, but they had a 'rigorous process'.

Friends told the Press Herald that Collins-Faunce had been targetting Ethan, and that his girlfriend had never known. 'He's been targeting Ethan and she just didn't realize it,' Nicole Tucker said.

Anger issues: Collins-Faunce was discharged from the military after he held a knife to a roommate's throat

The affidavit also noted that Collins-Faunce has been taking medication
for post-traumatic stress disorder as he was 
physically and sexually abused as a boy by various foster parents.

He told police he was discharged from the military after he held a knife to a roommate's 
throat and had been an alcohol throughout 2010 but had since stopped drinking.

His medication for post-traumatic stress disorder had recently changed, and he was having trouble sleeping. But Tucker said his new mood stabilisers seemed to be worked.

'The day this happened, he didn't take his meds,' she said.

Collins-Faunce is being held in the York County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail.

The other two children were removed from the home but Henderson is now petitioning to have them returned now her fiance is out of the house.
