A 10-year-old girl who wrote a heart-wrenching letter to her father on the fifth anniversary of his death has been reunited with the note after dropping it in a car park.

The touching message addressed 'Dear Daddy' was handwritten by Summer Lloyd, from Yeovil, Somerset, and was going to be attached to a balloon before being let off into the sky.

However, the youngster dropped the letter outside the Prince of Wales Pub on Ham Hill in Somerset, and feared she had lost it forever. 

The touching note, which was found outside the Prince of Wales Pub on Ham Hill in Somerset, was written by Summer Lloyd, 10, (left) to her father on the fifth anniversary of his death. She planned to attach it to a balloon but dropped it. Summer gave a plant to the pub's landlady Nicki Holroyd (right) after she returned it today

The heart-breaking letter is addressed 'Dear Daddy' and was written by  Summer, who signs off 'Lots of love, your little girl'. Her father died suddenly five years ago and she was going to let off a balloon with the note

In the touching note to her father, who died suddenly five years ago, she writes: 'At night I sometimes look at the sky and I make a wish on the brightest star I see and I believe it is you.'

She also tells how she wishes she could have had 'one last goodbye and one last hug before you took your journey to your new home in heaven.'

The note is signed off: 'RIP Daddy. Lots of love, your little girl Summer xxxxxxx.'

It has now been reunited with the youngster after a customer handed it in to the pub and landlady Nicki Holroyd launched a Facebook appeal in a bid to return it.

Summer said she was delighted her note was found and said she had let the balloon off without the letter, having feared it was lost.

She said: 'We let off the balloon anyway and a bird appeared in the sky which seemed to hover near us, it was very special.

‘Thank you Nicki for giving me back my letter, I think I will keep it now and frame it.'

The schoolgirl went to the pub today to retrieve her letter and handed Ms Holroyd some flowers to thank her for keeping it safe.

Summer's mother Sarah said: ‘I really appreciate what Nicki did, it meant a lot to Summer.

‘The appeal on Facebook was seen all over the world including her relatives in Australia, so she said to me this morning “mummy I'm famous!”

‘It's been tough and she misses her dad so every year we try to do this - it helps her and is a kind of therapy.’ 

Ms Holroyd, 51, had posted an image of the letter on Facebook in a bid to try and trace Summer and return the note.

She wrote alongside the photograph: 'One of our customers handed this in.

'It's the most heart-wrenching letter from a young girl who has written the most lovely letter to her dad who has died and is in heaven.

'Please help to try and trace her, we can never throw it away.

'As far as I can gather the letter was found in the car park so I think it was dropped rather than left.'

The letter was found after being dropped in the car park of the Prince of Wales Pub on Ham Hill in Somerset (pictured). It has now been reunited with Summer after an appeal on Facebook was spotted by the family

The Prince of Wales Pub said on Facebook today that the letter had been returned to the little girl's family

She added: 'It doesn't feel right that we have it. It is a beautifully written letter so we need to have a go at reuniting it with its author.

'The writer is called Summer and judging from the letter's content, she has brothers and sisters.'

Ms Holroyd confirmed today that she had managed to hand the letter back after Summer’s family contacted the pub.

She said: ‘I'm so pleased the letter has been reunited with Summer, she touched all our hearts.

‘What a lovely girl and such a sweet letter.’

She also thanked those on social media who helped share the image which resulted in the Lloyd family getting in touch.

Writing on the pub's official Facebook page, she said: 'Thank you all for your help in finding the rightful owner of such a special letter.

'They are very grateful we didn't just disregard it and are pleased to have it back.'

'Dear Daddy. I love you. I miss you so much and I wish you were here right now!

'At night I sometimes look at the sky and make a wish and I make a wish on the brightest star I see and I believe it is you.

'I always think of you on your birthday, father's day, my birthday and Christmas and always after.

'Happy some days sad the other but right now I can feel you in my heart and you are always in my mind but I just wish I could have said one last goodbye and one last hug before you took your journey to your new home in heaven.

'I know all my brothers and sisters and everyone in our familys (sic) miss you every day too and wish you were still here but until we meet again or talk again I will leave you to rest.

'I love you so much xx RIP daddy xx and I hope you are happy where you are xxx

'Lots of love, your little girl Summer, I love you xxxxxxx.'
