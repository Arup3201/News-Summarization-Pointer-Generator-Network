Mouths were no doubt watering when the world's biggest hot dog was unveiled on Friday at the Miami-Dade County Fair.

Juicy's Outlaw Grill cooked the 125.5 pound dog for three hours on a 100-foot mobile grill, The Miami Herald reports.

By itself, the dog weighed 51 pounds. The other 74.5 pounds come from a bun and a large amount of condiments.

Brett Enright, founder and CEO of Juicy's Outright Grill, already holds the Guinness World Record for the the largest commercially available hamburger. It costs weighs 777 pounds, costs $5,000, and can be prepared in two days' notice.

The massive hot dog is also available for purchase -- and costs a mere $1,000 in comparison, according to the paper.

Enright, it reports, covered the hot dog in pounds of condiments and sliced onions before it was finally weighed.

The giant hot dog was later cut up into samples costing $1 each

Witnesses, including former NFL wide receiver Ike Hilliard, reviewed the weigh-in. A notary prepared documents for Guinness to review, the paper reports.

The giant hot dog was later cut up into samples going for $1 each. Proceeds went to the Miami Rescue Mission.

Enright said he plans to out-do himself if faced with Chicago competition.

'Thereâ€™s a guy in Chicago who had the previous hot dog record,' he said. 'Iâ€™m hoping he comes back and beats this so we can turn around and make the biggest hot dog the world has ever seen.'

Enright is likely referring to Chicago-based Dan Abbate, who held the record for the world's largest commercially available hot dog in 2012. His Big Hot Dogs weighs 7 pounds each and offer 40 servings.
