If you’re a woman in the US and you want the best quality of life, Minnesota is the place to be, according to a new study.

It came top of the pile in a study of all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia, that looked at over a dozen factors to establish the best and worse for women to live in.

To coincide with Women’s History Month, WalletHub looked at, among other things, how much women in America’s states earned, health care standards and employment and poverty levels.

After Minnesota it found that the next best states to live in are Massachusetts, Vermont, Maryland and New Hampshire.

South Carolina, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas came bottom of the pile.

Number one for women’s health care is Vermont and number one for economic social and well-being is Maryland.

The best place for a woman to earn big bucks is the District of Columbia, according to the study, and the state with the lowest unemployment rate for women is North Dakota, with Nevada having the highest number of jobless women.

New Hampshire scored very well when the researchers analysed education levels, with the state having the lowest high school dropout rate in the country.

Arizona was found to have the highest dropout rate.

For a long life, it seems that President Obama’s birthplace of Hawaii is the place to be – it has the highest Life expectancy at birth, with Mississippi registering the lowest.

WalletHub said that it drew its conclusions after looking at data from sources including the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Center for Educational Statistics.

It said: ‘Much work remains to be done in the name of social progress. In some states, women continue to fall behind their male counterparts in various measures. For instance, women represent nearly two-thirds of all minimum-wage workers in the U.S. And in the 22 states that have refused to expand their Medicaid programs under the Affordable Care Act, women comprise the majority of poor uninsured adults.’
