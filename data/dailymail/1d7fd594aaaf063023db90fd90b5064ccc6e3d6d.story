Chained together in two lines, they raise their hands to their heads under the watchful eyes of armed soldiers.

These photos show suspected Hamas militants who have been rounded up chain-gang style by Israeli soldiers during the Israel-Gaza conflict.

The alleged rebels were captured after the Army entered the Gaza strip in a bid to put an end to deadly Hamas rocket attacks.

During the offensive, 30 Israeli soldiers were killed and dozens more injured, while numerous militants are also believed to have lost their lives.

Following their capture, the suspects were forced to wear blue overalls, before being blindfolded and made to sit in a small enclosure with barbed wire fencing.

One photo shows four of the alleged militants later walking in chains as they are accompanied by armed Israeli soldiers.

Since the conflict in Gaza began more than two weeks ago, nearly 790 Palestinians have been killed, including 190 children, according to Palestinian health officials. A further 5,000 have been wounded.

Today, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who is on a tour of the Middle East, said he was deeply concerned about the rising civilian death toll.

'As this campaign goes on and the 
civilian casualties in Gaza mount, Western public opinion is becoming 
more and more concerned and less and less sympathetic to Israel,' he said.

UN humanitarian chief Valerie Amos also expressed worry about the mounting civilian casualties, saying it was 'almost impossible' for Palestinians to shelter from Israeli air strikes in the densely-populated territory.Â

'It doesn't matter how hard Israel tries to minimise harm, this is an extremely overcrowded stretch of land,' she said.

Meanwhile, U.S. airlines today lifted a two-day suspension of flights to Israel, but not all international airlines followed suit, with Germanmy's Lufthansa extending its ban for a further 24 hours.

The ban was put in place on Tuesday after a rocket hit a house very close to the runways, with Hamas hailing the suspension of Tel Aviv flights as a 'great victory'.

So far, 32 Israeli soldiers and three civilians have died in the fighting.

It comes as far-right hawk Reuven Rivlin has been sworn in as Israel's 10th president, replacing elder statesman Shimon Peres.

With the nation in mourning, today's inauguration ceremony was scaled down.

However, Rivlin said it sent a 'very clear message to our enemies: you have not overcome us and you will not do so'.

Prime Minister: Tayyip Erdogan today said Turkey would push for Israel to be tried at an international criminal court if it kept up its assault on Gaza

Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan 
today said his country would push for Israel to be tried at an 
international criminal court if it kept up its assault on Gaza.

Turkey,
 a member of the U.S.-led NATO military alliance, was once Israel's 
closest regional ally, but has recently become one of its most vitriolic critics.

'At
 the moment, Hamas is prepared for everything in order to achieve a 
ceasefire... (Palestinian President Mahmoud) Abbas is prepared too,' 
Erdogan told CNN news channel in an interview.

'Israel
 is not even approaching such a thing and is spitting death, spitting 
blood.'

Mr Erdogan's comments come just days after he accused Israel of 'surpassing Hitler in barbarism' with its Gaza offensive.

'If
 Israel continues with this attitude, it will definitely be tried at 
international courts,' Erdogan, who is campaigning for a presidential 
election on August 10, told a rally of supporters in the southern port 
city of Mersin.

'We will see this happen and Turkey will struggle for this,' he told the cheering crowd.

Today, Mr Erdogan stood by his comments likening Israel's actions to those of Hitler and said the Jewish state was committing genocide.

'It
 is beyond comprehension that Israel is still defended by the West and 
the world is silent about it. Therefore we cannot remain silent and we 
will not be silent,' he said.

The politician's rhetoric will likely play well with his electoral base of largely conservative 
Sunni Muslim voters, who he hopes will hand him victory in next month's 
poll, the first time Turkey's president will have been elected by a 
popular vote and not by parliament.
