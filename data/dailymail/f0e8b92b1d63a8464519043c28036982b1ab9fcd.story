Proud parents: Iraq war veteran Hannah Campbell 
is miraculously pregnant despite a gun shot
 wound to her womb

When soldier Hannah Campbell was shot in the stomach while serving in Iraq, she was told she would never be able to have a baby.

The brave 28-year-old was given the devastating news by doctors after being dug out from underneath the rubble of a blasted building.

A high velocity bullet had badly damaged the corporal’s womb, while the building’s collapse left her blind in one eye and with her leg so badly shattered it had to be amputated.

Despite being ‘absolutely devastated’ by the news she would never conceive, she felt lucky to be alive.

But now, against all the odds, Miss Campbell has astonished doctors by becoming pregnant.

The former soldier, who has weekly scans to check on the strength of her womb, is six months pregnant by her long-term partner, Anthony McMorrow, 32, and has so far had a healthy pregnancy.

The couple say they are ‘delighted’ to be expecting a daughter, who they plan to name Lexi-River Antonia McMorrow.

From their home in Northampton, Miss Campbell told how she discovered she was expecting her ‘miracle’ baby on a routine visit to her doctor.

‘It was totally unexpected,’ she said. ‘The room started spinning. I just remember muttering: “Oh my god. No, that can’t be possible,” and I just walked out in a daze.

‘I was in such a state I then got back in the car and drove back to the doctor as I needed him to tell me again. He had to repeat himself five times as I just didn’t believe it.

‘It was only then that it began to sink in and I felt utter joy and excitement that something so wonderful and miraculous had happened against all the odds.’

Miss Campbell already has a daughter, Milly, eight, from a previous relationship and says this is what comforted her when she was told she would never conceive – even though she had always wanted a big family.

She is now a beauty therapist and plans to set up a business with her partner in the New Year.

Miss Campbell was deployed with 47 Artillery Regiment on sentry duty in Basra when insurgents opened fire and hit the building she was guarding with a mortar bomb on June 18, 2007.

‘There was no warning. The building was flattened and I was underneath it. I was later told US Special Forces took two and a half hours to dig me out,’ she said. Her first terrifying realisation was that the debris was packed so tightly against her face, she could not move her lips and could barely breathe.

‘I can remember screaming so they could find me. I had a cardiac arrest when they got to me so I must have been holding on just for them,’ she said. Miss Campbell, who was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder following her ordeal, has shown incredible strength and bravery in getting on with her life back home.

She was left in a coma for three weeks and was partially blinded in one eye by the blast as a metal pole had pierced her face. She needed plastic surgery and today has just 20 per cent vision in her left eye.

Her left hand was almost split in two and she had bleeding on the brain.

A second pole had pierced the top of her leg, leaving her lower left leg and foot almost completely shattered. She was flown to Birmingham’s Selly Oak Hospital where she had 19 operations. It was three years later that she decided to have her leg amputated as she was living in constant pain.

‘I’d become redundant as a mother. The pain meant I was unable to bathe Milly, I was confined to a wheelchair and my weight ballooned to 21-and-a-half stone,’ she said. 

But Miss Campbell, who joined the army in order to become an army nurse which she is now unable to do given her injuries, is focusing on the future. She said: ‘Most people I meet have no idea I served in Iraq.

‘They just see me as a proud mum at the school gate. It’s not that I hide my past, but I don’t dwell on it either. I live for today. Even after what happened I have no regrets as it’s made me a stronger person.’
