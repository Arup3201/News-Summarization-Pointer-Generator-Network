Two Dutch pranksters ask the question we have all wanted to know the answer to.

Can you really fool so-called experts into eating unhealthy food, believing it is the latest organic trend?

And it seems the answer is yes, with the due managing to convince foodies that McDonald's food is actually a healthy alternative.

These two girls were impressed with Sacha and Cedrique's offering

When asked to compare the duos food to McDonald's, their response was hilarious

Founder and CEO of Lifehunters, who aims to make movies that should go viral, Erik Hensel, told MailOnline: 'A lot of people in Holland are talking about organic and healthy food, so we wanted to see if people could really taste the difference between McDonald's and organic healthy food, which they didn't. 

'When we saw the reactions in the edit we were laughing out loud, since it was so funny.

'We wanted to create something that was worth spreading and worth talking about. We wondered if you could taste if food is organic, so we tried it with McDonald's food since that was the least organic or natural food we could think off.

'We didn't had much expectations of the reactions, but the responses were great, especially because we just asked them what they thought about it and if it tasted better than McDonald's. 

'The 'experts' told us it was way better and could 'really' taste the organic element in it.'

It might not look like class canapes but this was chopped chicken and fish from McDonald's

It might not look appealing, but food experts loved the Dutch duo's offerings 

The turnaround from Chicken McNuggets to organic convention standard was astounding

The pranksters had some fun along the way as they got set to dupe the public

Sacha and Cedrique, who are two of the Lifehunters, attend an organic food convention in Houten, Holland, where they were to present their delicacies.

The problem is, that they don't even own a restaurant or have a menu of organically sourced foods, so they decide to play the ultimate prank. 

The pair head to a nearby McDonald's, and bag up a selection of items from the menu.

Then, using only cutlery and some cocktail sticks, they transform the food into smaller, bitesize portions, and decided to market it as their new organic food menu.

This 'expert' was definitely impressed with the fast food 

Maybe this gentleman should have had a swill out before taking on McDonald's food

The taste-testing reactions of locals and experts at the convention at the Expo, Houten, are cringeworthy brilliant, as it is now time to 'some McDonald's snacks to the biggest food experts of the Benelux.'

One gentleman, after swallowing down some Fillet-0-Fish says: 'Tastes like fish, reminds me of cod, rolls around the tongue nicely, if it were wine I'd say it's fine.' 

To spice things up still further, the duo ask people what they see as the key difference between their 'organic' treats and McDonald's.

This lady's best bit was the fresh tomato - which the Dutch boys had earlier suggested was 'out of date'

The organic convention drew a crowd of 'food experts as well as the general public

The responses are laugh out loud. 

Two girls, having tasted the Dutch duo's delicacies are posed the question: 'If you had to compare this, to say, McDonald's food, what would you say is the biggest difference?'

To which, the excruciating reply is: 'It definitely tastes a lot better, and the fact it is organic is definitely a good thing.

'The taste is a lot richer.'  

Putting some Dutch flags onto the McDonald's food - a sure-fire way to trick the public

Another girl, who judging by her attire is either part of a stall herself, or one of the 'experts' says about the McDonald's: 'It's definitely a lot tastier than McDonald's, you can just tell it is a lot more pure.'

Another lady adds: 'This absolutely has a lot more taste to it than McDonald's.' 

At the end of the video, Sacha asks Cedrique what they have learnt from their expedition.

Cedrique responds: 'That if you tell people that something is organic, they'll automatically believe it's organic.'

Quite so, Cedrique, quite so.
