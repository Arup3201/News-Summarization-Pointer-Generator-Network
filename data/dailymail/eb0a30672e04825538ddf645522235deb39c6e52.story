George Osborne was today forced to deny thinking that Iain Duncan Smith is not clever enough to be a Cabinet minister.

The Chancellor and the Work and Pensions Secretary have been engaged in a bitter turf war over the future of benefits reform.

But a new book reveals that relations between the two senior ministers are far worse than previously admitted.

Clash: George Osborne (right) was forced to deny thinking Iain Duncan Smith was not clever enough to be in the Cabinet

Mr Osborne privately expressed frustration that Mr Duncan Smith ‘opposes every cut’ to benefits, according to In It Together by Matthew d’Ancona.

As Work and Pensions Secretary Mr Duncan Smith is the architect of the government’s welfare reforms but has been locked in long-running battles with the Treasury over funding for his plans.

According to the book, Mr Osborne confided in allies: ‘You see Iain giving presentations and realise he’s just not clever enough.’

In return, Mr Duncan Smith views Mr Osborne and David Cameron as the political equivalent of television presenters Ant and Dec, the book claims.

But Mr Osborne today denied criticising Mr Duncan Smith for not being clever.

‘No, I did not. And I, by the way, work incredibly closely with Iain Duncan Smith,’ he told BBC radio 4’s Today programme.

‘I think he is a remarkable individual who has transformed, almost single-handedly, the entire debate about welfare in this country and is deeply compassionate… And very clever.

He went on: ‘Just because it’s in a book doesn’t make it true. I have huge, huge respect and time for Iain Duncan Smith.

‘And, by the way, here’s a staggering truth about this Government: the fact that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Welfare Secretary can work together and deliver programmes like this and talk to each other is itself a sign that we have a functional government that is working for hardworking people.’

Denial: The Chancellor insisted he worked incredibly well with his Cabinet colleagues

Mr Osborne and David Cameron were Tory aides when Mr Duncan Smith was leader.

According to the book, the ‘In the words of one familiar with IDS’s sensitivities,’ the book says, ‘Imagine waking up one morning to find out Ant and Dec are running the country.’

When Mr Osborne vowed to slash child benefit at the Tory conference of 2010, Mr Duncan Smith was caught off guard and warned the Chancellor that he was on a ‘power trip’.

‘I thought we were a team!’ Iain Duncan Smith exclaimed. ‘If we are going to do this . . . you know, we have to work as a team!’

Mr Duncan Smith’s spokeswoman refused to respond to the claims but one ally dismissed the ‘tittle tattle’, adding: ‘I’d be surprised if he knew who Ant and Dec are.’
