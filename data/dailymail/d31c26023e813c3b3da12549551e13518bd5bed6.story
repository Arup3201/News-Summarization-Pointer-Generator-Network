The former country retreat of assassinated Pakistan prime minister Benazir Bhutto, which later became a hub for sex parties, is expected to fetch up to £10m when it goes up for auction next month.

Bhutto and her husband Asif Zardari owned The Rockwood Estate in Surrey from 1995 until 2005 and carried out a series of upgrades.

The couple had a master bedroom with a reinforced concrete domed ceiling installed along with a replica of the local pub built in the basement.

The Rockwood Estate, set in around 350 acres of Surrey countryside near Godalming, is dominated by the main home which has more than 30 rooms.

They spent incredible figures on furnishings, including £120,000 on a dining table.

The
 property is now a shadow of its former glory and, while liveable, it is
 likely anyone buying it would have it fully restored or knocked down 
and replaced with a new mansion.

It also has a separate farm, a pool house, two cottages and an airfield complete with hangar and windsock.

The current owners have never lived in the property, which is better known in Karachi as The Surrey Mansion.

The
 mansion, available in whole or as 12 lots, will be auctioned off on 
July 4 by Clarke Gammon Wellers at the Radisson Blu in Guildford.

It
 is expected to sell for around £10million - with the buyer getting 
planning permission to replace the main home with a new mansion.

Nick
 Freeth, from Clarke Gammon Wellers, said: 'Local people know about the 
estate and so do people in Pakistan, it made headline news over there.

'The whole estate would suit someone looking for privacy but also be within 40 minutes of London.

'There is also a working airstrip, although I'm not sure I would like to land on it.

Value: It is expected to sell for around £10 million - with the buyer getting planning permission to replace the main home with a new mansion

Condition: While the property is liveable, it is likely anyone buying it would have it fully restored or knocked down and replaced with a new mansion

Energy usage: Heating the property is expected to cost about £13,000 a year

Reinforced: The master bedroom has a domed ceiling with stars which sparkle at night and is also thought to feature reinforced concrete

'So far we've had individuals and businesses looking at it. The estate would make a great home but also something like a school.

'They
 must have spent a lot of money on it but it wasn't until 2004 that 
Zardawi admitted they owned it. And Ms Bhutto denied ever even visiting 
it.

'There is a highly 
sophisticated air-conditioning system which was installed by them and it
 is thought to have cost £750,000 to install.

'Heating the place will cost around £13,000 a year so it's not a home for the feint-hearted.

'But at £10million it offers good value. This would only get you a four-bedroom home in Mayfair.

sparkle at night. It is also meant to feature reinforced concrete.

'Zardawi went to the nearby Dog and Feather and tried to buy it but they wouldn't sell so he recreated it in the basement.

'It is a fascinating and unusual property with amazing views.'
