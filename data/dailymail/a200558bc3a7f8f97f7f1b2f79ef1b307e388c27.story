A travelling freak show has been forced to advertise a vacancy for a 'wolf boy/girl' in order to comply with Britain's employment laws.

The Circus of Horrors, which reached the finals of Britain’s Got Talent in 2011, had signed up Jesus ‘Chuy’ Aceves of Mexico, who has a medical condition that means hair grows all over his face, to take part.

But the producers found their new appointment breaches a government law which requires the job to be advertised in the UK on websites so that British jobseekers can apply if they wish.

Hair raising: Mexican wolf boy, Jesus Aceves, had been signed up for the show before circus bosses were told they had to put the job out for any UK candidates

If no British wolf boy or girl can be found, then Jesus will get the job.

According to the online advert, the successful candidate will earn up to £500 per week and that all applicants must be genuinely hairy – people with beards or wearing masks are unacceptable.

The advert states applicants 'must have a minimum of 60,000 hairs growing on the face and linking up with the hairline, hair on the head is not included'

It adds: 'Duties to include all aspects of working as a wolf person and any other circus skills would be an advantage.'

The Circus of Horrors is playing 57 dates across the country over the coming months.

Dr Haze, the show’s creator, said: 'It is a strange state of affairs, we are pretty sure there are not any Wolf Boys or Girls in the UK, but we still have to advertise the job over here.

'The thing is, the applicant must be a genuine Wolf person.'

The advert says applicants for the job must have at least 60,000 hairs on their face

Perplexed: Circus of Horrors boss Dr Haze said the show had been left in a 'strange situation' after being told they had to offer the role to UK jobseekers

The Circus of Horrors rose to fame after appearing in Britain's Got Talent in 2011

A UK Border Agency spokeswoman said: 'This government is determined to control immigration while remaining open to the brightest and the best.

'All UK-based employers who wish to obtain a sponsor licence have to adhere to the rules set out in the application process.'

Mr Acheves, who arrived in the UK last year and was thought to be the first Wolf person to visit the country in 30 years, has a rare condition called Hyper Trichosis.

People with the condition, which is sometimes nicknamed 'Werewolf Syndrome', have a particularly high level of body hair.

It is understood he will play a part in the show if no suitable applicants come through the recruitment process.

The job advert can be viewed by visiting direct.gov.uk and searching for ‘wolf boy’.
