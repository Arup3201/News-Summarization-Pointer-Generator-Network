When they're not swinging from the trees some monkeys can find themselves down in the dumps.

That was clearly the case for little Angelica this week.

The monkey was filmed in her enclosure at the Zoological Wildlife Foundation in Miami, Florida, sorrowfully putting one hand to her eyes.

But thankfully she had someone to console her, and footage shows Toby coming to save the day with a bit of loving.

The male primate gently puts an arm around his pal.

He then proceeds to give her shoulders a massage.

It's not known why Angelica had hit such a low, but maybe it was something to do with the outfit she was wearing.

She and Toby appear dressed in miniature summer ensembles.

The duo are capuchin monkeys, a species which is found throughout the Amazon in a variety of forest types.

They are omnivores, eating not only fruits, nuts, seeds, and buds, but also insects, spiders, birds' eggs, and small vertebrates. 

The video of Toby and Angelica, which was posted to Instagram, quickly garnered thousands of likes with many viewers deeming the tender moment 'cute' and 'adorable'.
