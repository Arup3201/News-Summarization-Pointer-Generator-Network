Nicholas Sparks, known for penning powerful novels about enduring love, is splitting from his wife of 25 years - the woman who inspired many of his books.

The author, who has written 17 romantic novels including Hollywood hit 'The Notebook', revealed the decision to People magazine, but insisted that he remains close friends with his wife Cathy.

'This is, of course, not a decision we've made lightly,' he told the magazine. 'We remain close friends with deep respect for each other and love for our children. For our children's sake, we regard this as a private matter.'

The couple has three sons and twin daughters, ranging in age from 12 to 23.

Sparks has long credited his wife, a former lending-company account executive, as being key to his success, telling eHarmony in 2012: 'All of the female characters I create have many elements of my wife.'

In the interview, he explained that he was on spring break in Florida while at Notre Dame business school when he met Cathy on a Monday night.

'On Tuesday night, I told her that we would get married,' he said.

The couple married in 1989 - seven years before The Notebook made him a star.

He has written 17 romantic novels, including nine that have been made into movies, such as Dear John, A Walk to Remember and Message in a Bottle.

While he has mastered romantic tales, he previously told People magazine that he is reluctant to give out marriage tips. 

'There are people who are probably much better at marriage than I am – they've lasted a lot longer,' he said in 2003. 'I could probably learn from them.'

Two years ago, the couple said in another interview with the magazine that they focused on putting their relationship first and made sure they would take walks alone. 

'We try to go on vacations alone,' Cathy added. 'You need to leave alone. You have to make the effort to leave, take the time. Just go and have fun alone. We do it a few times a year.'
