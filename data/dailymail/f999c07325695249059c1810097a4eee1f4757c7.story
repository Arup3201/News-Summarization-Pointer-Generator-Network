It was almost as if David Moyes had borrowed some of the magic of the FA Cup on Sunday night at Anoeta as his Real Sociedad played at being giant-killers and took the scalp of Barcelona.

On one of the greatest nights of his managerial career Moyes masterminded a 1-0 win with the side he took over last November seeing off Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar in style.

He was given a helping hand by opposing coach Luis Enrique who bizarrely left Messi out of his starting line-up – perhaps the Barca coach was also paying homage to the world’s oldest club cup competition by resting his most important players.

That strange team sheet which also included Neymar, Gerard Pique, Dani Alves and Ivan Rakitic on the bench was the first shock of the night, the second came after just one minute when a header from Jordi Alba went flying past his own keeper to give Real Sociedad the lead.

Barca came into the game having picked up just one of a possible 12 points in their last four visits to Anoeta. They were facing a Real Sociedad side who had already beaten Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid at home. 

Luis Enrique’s side now needed a goal but with top scorer in the league Messi (15 goals) on the bench and Neymar, Barca's second highest league scorer with 1, alongside him that was always going to be more difficult.

This was not the way for Barcelona to take advantage of Real Madrid having lost to Valencia in the earlier Sunday game giving them the chance to go top.

Luis Suarez was looking for his second league goal of the season and might have fancied his chances from a free-kick on 20 minutes but Xavi took the set-piece and sent it over the bar. Suarez then charged through on goal but played in Pedro who squandered the chance. The former Liverpool striker cut a frustrated figure in an attack between Pedro and youngster Munir El Haddadi. It wasn’t what he signed up for when he made his £75million pound switch in the summer.

Suarez played in Pedro again but this time the winger crossed and when the ball hit Inigo Martinez on the arm Suarez appealed but the referee waved away the calls for a penalty.

Real Sociedad almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead. Full-back Alberto de la Bella admitted recently that Moyes has been encouraging him to overlap a-la Leighton Baines and the defender flew down the left and crossed for Xabi Prieto who just failed to connect under pressure from Jordi Alba. It was the perfect chance to make it 2-0 but there was another scare for Barça moments after.

Sergio Canales pulled off a clever turn that left Martin Montoya on the seat of his shorts and the former Real Madrid man shot at Claudio Bravo only for the one-time Real Sociedad keeper to palm the effort away.

Vela then charged through and was booked for diving, the former Arsenal man had gone down under a challenge from Javier Mascherano. With two minutes left of the first half and Messi already warming up Barca had their first shot on target but it came from distance from Pedro and was comfortably saved by Geronimo Rulli.

Real Sociedad supporters whistled match official Carlos del Cerro Grande off the pitch at half time after he booked Inigo Martinez in injury time for handling as he stopped Suarez going past him. The ball did not appear to have touched the defender as he went to ground. All Barça eyes were on Messi ready to make his delayed entrance at the start of the second half.

He replaced Munir on 45 minutes and Neymar replaced Pedro on the hour – once the Brazilian had removed his necklace. He was perhaps not expecting to come on having had the least rest during the midwinter break.

Despite the changes it was Real Sociedad who looked like scoring next with Prieto heading just over after Bravo had failed to come for a cross. 

Messi tried to bundle his way through at the other end as the visitors did their best to get a foothold back in the game. He took the next sent piece but came no closer than Xavi had in the first half. Alves was thrown on too and with Barca switching to three at the back Real Sociedad needed some heroic defending to see out the second half but with Inigo Martinez superbly marshaling the troops Moyes men did exactly that. Suarez had the best chance but was brilliantly denied by Rulli.

After so many headlines about Moyes’ future at Manchester United, on Monday morning the inquests will all be for his rival Enrique. The Spaniard’s job is in doubt. Moyes has won his first big game in Spain and is settling in very nicely indeed.

12 months ago, David Moyes was reeling after Manchester United were dumped out of the FA Cup at the first hurdle by Swansea City. A last-minute goal by Wilfried Bony secured a 2-1 win at Old Trafford after Javier Hernandez equalised a Wayne Routledge opener.
