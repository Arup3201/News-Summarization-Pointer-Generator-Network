Liverpool may have lost out in the title race but they are top of the table when it comes to earnings over the 2013-14 season.

Brendan Rodgers' side finished two points behind Manchester City, who lifted the Premier League trophy, but their projected earnings are £1m more.

And the value of TV revenue and being in the top flight can be seen by bottom club Cardiff, who received just £1.2m as a merit payment, picking up £64m when television and Premier League share is factored in.

Not in the red: Liverpool topped the table for season's earnings

Manchester United have had a hugely disappointing campaign on the pitch but their appeal to broadcasters is clear, as only the top four earned more over the season.

Each side received £54m for just being in the Premier League, then their performances and TV lure is factored in.

There was potential for teams such as Hull to earn up to £4m from the last round of matches but the positions stayed largely the same.

Alan Pardew might not be popular with Newcastle fans but Mike Ashley will be pleased that his manager has brought in nearly £79m. 

Money goal: Charlie Adam's late winner at West Brom bagged Stoke an extra £1.2m

Over achievers? Newcastle's final-day defeat at Liverpool cost them £1.2m in prize money but they still brought in £79m in total

Looking up: Gus Poyet masterminded Sunderland's escape act and that netted the club a tidy sum

But the Magpies' defeat at Liverpool on 
the final day allowed Stoke - 2-1 victors at West Brom - to leapfrog 
them into ninth and so collect the extra £1.2m in prize money.

And the £66m picked up by Norwich, the £65m banked by Fulham and Cardiff's £64m will give them a financial advantage in next season's Championship.

Perhaps the most significant increase in windfall, however, was that of Sunderland's. They climbed from bottom to 14th during the final weeks of the season to pocket £8.4m in merit money, as opposed to £1.2m had they finished in 20th.
