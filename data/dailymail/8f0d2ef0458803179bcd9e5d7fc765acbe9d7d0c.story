A 30 stone man required 24 members of the emergency services to free him from his car after a crash.

Steve Wilson's size meant that instead of walking away from the scene with a dented vehicle, his car was reduced to scrap metal and he had to be winched out by fire fighters risking their own health.

His story is featured in a new Channel 5 
series, Big Body Squad, which shows how the emergency services must be increasingly prepared to deal with the fall-out of super-sized people.

Supersize: 30 stone Steve Wilson required 24 members of the emergency services to free him from his car after a crash

A quarter of Britons are now obese and the emergency services are feeling the full effect of the country's waistlines.

Not only are the call-outs more demanding and time consuming, they also mean that other calls can't be dealt with - and cost three times the usual rescue amount.

Daily call outs mean the cost of rescuing overweight people has soared to £1m over five years. In County Durham, where this incident occurred, call outs have soared by 150 per cent since 2008.

There are currently 800 purpose-built
 big body ambulances in the UK and the number is steadily rising, 
costing the UK taxpayer millions each year.

Because of his size, Steve is wedged behind the car's steering wheel - and there's no hope of the 52-year-old getting out by himself.

A truck with heavy lifting gear arrives - followed by the Police, Ambulance Service and three fire trucks - bringing the total number of crew to 24. There are four police officers, five paramedics and 15 firefighters on the scene.

The fire crew needs as much space as possible to try and get to him and free him - but due to his huge 30st frame, they can only get the space they need by slicing metal dangerously lose to his head. This means that one slip-up could be catastrophic.

In order to try and get to him, firefighters have to snap his seat and remove the door and the roof of the car - reducing it to scrap metal. 

With a potential spine injury, it is important to keep Steve still. But because he's so overweight there are no neck collars that fit him, the rescue team are forced to use a rolled-up blanket to try and keep him still.

When firefighters have finally chopped him from the car, it is time to lift him out. At 30 stone, it's a difficult lift and the crew are putting their backs in danger with such a weight.

Lifting him the few feet from the car to the ambulance takes 11 people five minutes  - and costs £1,500 than it would normally.

Steve is able to leave hospital after a check-up and says he 'hopes' to lose weight.

For the first time in history, obesity is killing more people than malnutrition.

Around 15 million Britons are obese and it is estimated that this will cost the UK a staggering £27 billion by 2016.

Bigger Big Body Squad begins on Wednesday January 8th on Channel 5 at 8pm.
