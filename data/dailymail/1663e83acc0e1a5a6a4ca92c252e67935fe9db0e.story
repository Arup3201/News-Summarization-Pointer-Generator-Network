Rolling hills were shrouded in mist this morning as Britons woke up shivering across the country in the 'unseasonably cold' August weather.

Bitter Arctic winds mean that the chilly temperatures are set to continue for the next few days - but picking up slightly in time for the Bank Holiday.

The mercury dipped as low as 2.1C in County Down, Northern Ireland, this morning and hovered around 3C in Devon and the Derybshire Peak District.

And tomorrow Britain will be colder than Siberia, feeling chillier than an average October in the UK as the Arctic summer shiver peaks.

Met Office forecaster Laura Young said: 'Temperatures are below average, and a lot cooler than average in the North, with northerly windchill making it feel cooler still. It is unseasonably cold.

'Thursday might be slightly cooler than Wednesday, with temperatures up slightly on Friday and back to normal by Sunday.

'Friday will see some light coastal showers, with Saturday and Sunday generally dry until rain moves in on Sunday afternoon from the West, with Monday looking pretty wet and certainly showery at least - with most places affected.'  

Today will remain cool with scattered showers in some parts of the country, but most places will stay dry, according to the Met Office.

Rain is predicted  in North-West Scotland and parts of Northern England, with heavy showers expected in Wales and Devon.

Tomorrow is set to be the coldest day of Britain’s week-long cool spell, with an average temperature of 18C in the South, 14C in the North and as low as 12C in Scotland.

But temperatures will feel like just 9-15C due to windchill from Arctic winds - with many parts colder than October’s average 11-15C highs.

On Friday there will be lightly showers on the South Coast, but this will clear up as the day goes on, according to the Met Office.

The average temperature will be in the late teens and in London it should reach 21C to 22C.

The outlook for the bank holiday looks positive for Saturday and Sunday, but heavy rain has been predicted for Monday.

Ms Young said: 'On Saturday there will be some light showers for Wales and central England. Sunday it will stay dry for most, but a low band of pressure will move in from the Atlantic and many areas will see rain later in the day. Monday it is looking wet for the whole country, but we are not sure how heavy it will be.
