A former Miss Spain winner has become the first champion of the competition to come out as gay.

Patrician Yurena revealed her sexuality by posting a picture of herself lying on bed with her girlfriend Vanesa Klein, a Spanish DJ and singer.

Called 'Romeo and Juliet', the picture has already attracted nearly 5,000 likes since it was posted on Instagram three days ago.

Miss Yurena, who won the Miss Spain competition in 2008 and 2013, is the first champion to come out as gay

According to The Local, she said: 'I don't regret what I did and I did it because I'm happy about what's going on in my life.'

She later added on Twitter: 'Thanks for all your comments. I published the picture completely spontaneously and in an impulsive manner. Thank you for all your support.'

Miss Yurena is a two-time winner of the Spanish beauty contest, lifting the trophy in 2008 and 2013.

She may also be the last winner after the company that organises the event, Certamen Miss Espana SL, went bust in May 2013.

Miss Yurena follows in the footsteps of Miss Kentucky winner Djuan Trent who came out as gay earlier this year.

Girlfriend: Vanesa Cortes, who is known professionally as Vanesa Klein, is a House DJ and singer in Spain

Career: She is little known outside the house music world despite starting her career at 14 and winning numerous awards, although previous girlfriends include Nagore Robles, a contestant on Spanish Big Brother

The image got nearly 5,000 likes on the photo sharing site when Miss Yurena (right) posted it three days ago

In a blog post written on February 20 she revealed her struggle to come to terms with her sexuality, saying she wondered why God had 'made me wrong'.

She added: 'Ideally, I would love to one day live in a society where coming out is no longer necessary because we don't make assumptions about one another's sexuality and homophobia is laid to rest. 

'For now, that is more of an ideal than it is a reality. But if you want to see that ideal become a reality and you have the courage to change history.'
