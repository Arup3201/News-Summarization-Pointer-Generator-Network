Mo Farah has a younger brother who spent time on remand after being arrested during the London riots, it was revealed yesterday.

Omar Farah, 20, was arrested and spent a month in a young offenders’ institution before charges against him were dropped.

In a further twist, he became homeless after his release and admitted regularly smoking cannabis.

The brother of Olympic hero Mo Farah has today spoken out about his criminal past

Omar’s lifestyle is a world away from 
his older brother’s, who became a national hero after winning both the 
5,000m and 10,000m at the Olympic Stadium in Stratford – not far from 
some of the worst scenes of the riots in East London.

Despite their vastly different fates, Mo, 29, gave his brother his full support and is helping him turn his life around.

And Omar was at the stadium to see his brother storm to victory in the 10,000m final.

Omar said: ‘The experience of being in the young offenders’ unit made me never want to  go back.

‘Mo’s success has inspired me to do something with my life. I don’t want to doss around and get in trouble with the police.’

Omar was caught up in the riots of 
August 2011 – when cities across the country erupted into violence and 
mass looting – and was arrested for using or threatening violence to 
others near Brentford, West London.

He was charged and remanded in custody at Feltham Young Offenders’ Institution after appearing before magistrates.

Mo gave his brother his full support, but they agreed they should keep their relationship secret for Omar’s safety.

Recalling the riots, Omar said: ‘I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

‘I got caught up in Brentford and the 
police grabbed us because we were running. They thought because we were 
running we must have done something wrong.

‘It was scary inside Feltham. I was worried about what would happen if they knew who my brother was.

‘I told him I was innocent and he said he’d stick by me.

‘He gave me a little talk when I got put in remand and he said, “If you actually did do it, just ride your time, get out, and just change your life”.

‘I made sure I kept my head down and listened to my brother’s advice.’

The charges were dropped and he was released after four weeks. But he then found himself homeless and penniless and was forced to live in a hostel.

Omar was born in 1992, a year after his father Mukhtar fled war-torn Somalia with Mo, and met his mother Fosiya Mohamed after settling in London.

Omar said: ‘I’m moving forward with my life and I have Mo to thank.

‘My dad said, “Why can’t you be more like Mo?” and that’s what I aim to do now.’
