Just when it seemed that everyone else should abandon hope against the machine-like quality of Novak Djokovic, along came Kei Nishikori to provide some inspiration.

It took the relatively diminutive Japanese, helped by an 02 Arena crowd fed up with one-sided matches, to show that the world No1 can be rattled, but ultimately yesterday’s result turned out as expected.

Djokovic is through to Sunday’s final of the Barcalys ATP World Finals with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-0 victory over Nishikori, but it seemed a blessing that for the first time in this event he was made to sweat for it.

That will have been noted by whoever plays him at the strange hour of 6pm this evening, the winner of last night’s all-Switzerland semi-final between Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka.

Djokovic has a strong but simmering temperament, and it boiled over at the start of an unexpected fightback from the hugely gifted Japanese player early in the second set.

The crowd — who in the past week have been disappointed by a diet largely consisting of uncompetitive matches — applauded a double fault from the Serb as he was broken back for 2-2.

Djokovic responded at the end of the game by sarcastically clapping them with one hand on his racket strings, and he was so needled that he lost his form and his footwork temporarily.

The 27-year-old Serb apologised afterwards, and blamed himself rather than the throng of more than 17,000 spectators who were heavily behind the underdog.

‘It’s sport and they want to see a more interesting match, I made a mistake and let my emotions go. I lost my concentration, I won’t do it again,’ he said. ‘The crowd has a right to cheer for who they want. Some individuals were going over the line the whole match, but I should have known better. The truth is it’s the end of the season and I’m exhausted but I still think I will have enough energy tomorrow.’

He looked anything but the supreme warrior during the six out of seven games that he lost, which led to him conceding a set for the first time since Federer beat him in China a month ago. Nishikori has an outstanding record in deciding sets, and when he had two break points in its opening game an upset seemed on, only for him to blow his chance and then unravel as Djokovic regained his composure.

That is the end of the season for Nishikori, but he has shown that if he can put his poor injury record behind him there are not many limits to what he can do next year. 

Andy Murray is already looking ahead to 2015 and yesterday Tim Henman became the latest pundit to urge him to employ a more expansive game if he wants to get back to Grand Slam- winning form.

‘He’s got all these shots in his armoury, my question is why doesn’t he use them?’ asked Henman. ‘He has to look at the way that he can be more offensive and more proactive instead of letting these players dictate to him. He’s got as good a two-handed backhand as Djokovic, but he doesn’t use it as much.’

While emphasising that he was applying high standards to Murray, Henman said: ‘He’s a great athlete, but he does too much running and, when he’s doing too much running, he’s not dictating enough.

‘It’s about clarity of thought and that’s when you’ve got to take a step back and look at the whole set-up, the whole team and his whole lifestyle and see whether that is working as well as it can.

‘I don’t think he has been playing the right way. Because Andy’s such a good player he’s capable of winning the wrong way.’

Kyle Edmund, the Yorkshire teenager reckoned to have the most potential for a GB player since Murray and Henman, was through to his first Challenger final on Sunday morning in Yokohama, Japan, and due to play Australian John Millman.
