From 'Grow your own Christian Grey' novelties to mugs, love scrolls and more, there's no shortage of merchandise cashing in on the Fifty Shades Of Grey trilogy.

Despite the variety, most have come without the blessing of author E.L James - until now. The best-selling writer has collaborated with Swedish fashion house KappAhl to create a range of lingerie based on the book.

Available in sexy black satin and elegant grey lace, the firm say the items are full of references to the book's characters, Christian Grey and Anastasia.

Glamorous: Plus size model Signe Nordstrom looks chic in her Fifty Shades Of Grey lingerie and mask

Looking good: The new range includes bras, briefs, negligees, dressing gowns and a kinky lace mask

The range includes bras, briefs, 
negligees, dressing gowns and the inevitable kinky mask - all available in a 'a choice of materials and silhouettes to suit women of 
all shapes and sizes', according to KappAhl.

Speaking about the new range, E.L James said: 'It has been incredibly exciting and interesting to be involved in the process, from the production of the concept through the design to the final collection.

'I have been deeply involved at all stages, and my thoughts and suggestions are clearly visible in the collection's garments.'

It is thought the author was also involved in the choice of model, which unusually for a lingerie campaign, features a plus-size woman.

Input: Author E.L James worked with KappAhl on the line and says her influence is apparent in the design

Elegant: According to KappAhl, most of the range comes in shades of grey with a dash of black and crimson

Her name might not trip easily off the tongue but chances are, you've seen Swedish plus size model Signe Nordstrom before.

Prior to landing the 50 Shades campaign, the 5ft 11, size 12 - 14 model, who hails from pretty Marstrand in West Sweden, starred in a major TV ad for Special K.

Other campaigns include work for Lova Weddings and Marisota.

According to plus size agency 12+, model, Signe Nordstrom, a size 12 to 14, boasts the 'statuesque physique and natural beauty [that makes her] perfect in the role of the femme fatale that the campaign wants to show.'

The fashion world obviously have a very different conception of the phrase 'plus size' because she looks very svelte indeed to us.

Carina Ladow, vice president of range and design at KappAhl, said: 'Both E L James and KappAhl felt that it was 
important for all women to be able to feel comfortable and beautiful 
while wearing the garments.

'Not surprisingly, the garments come in 
shades of grey with complementary colours such as red and black. The 
garments are embellished with lace details for a romantic feeling.

'We
 are always looking for new ways to interest our customers and this is 
the first time that KappAhl has entered into a collaboration of this 
type.

'It gives us an opportunity to offer our customers a feeling of 
luxury and frivolity in their everyday lives. The end result is better 
than we could have ever hoped and we are very happy with the enthusiasm 
and commitment shown by E L James.'Â
