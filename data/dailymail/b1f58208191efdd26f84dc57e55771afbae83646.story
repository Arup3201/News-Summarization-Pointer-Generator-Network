A man believed to have killed his pregnant girlfriend apologised on Facebook, saying 'he was not asking for sympathy'.

Willie Davis Hines Jr, 23, was being hunted by police after his girlfriend, 24-year-old Tatjana Cruz, was discovered unconscious with severe head injuries at the couple's home last Wednesday.

Hines, from Adelanto, California, said he was not 'armed or dangerous' but added: 'I am not trying to say there was any excuse for what I did but be clear that Tatjana, was very sneaky she always had something going on outside of Us.'

Miss Cruz's unborn child was dead on her arrival at hospital. She died two days later surrounded by family and friends after being taken off life support. She is believed to have two other sons and one boy may have witnessed her violent beating.

San Bernardino County sheriff's office would not confirm Hines wrote the Facebook post but said they were monitoring his profile closely.

The posting on Hines' Facebook page called Miss Cruz's death a 'disaster' and said his actions were not intentional.

He allegedly wrote: 'I fled the scene, because I don't think there is any way to prove that this is not just a act of pure hate.'

The brutal assault on Miss Hines happened last Wednesday evening. A neighbour who heard the attack called the police and identified Hines who was seen running from the home.

Police spokeswoman Jodi Miller told ABC7: 'The female was taken for severe injuries believed to be caused by blunt force trauma. She was pregnant. Unfortunately, her unborn child was pronounced deceased at the hospital.'

One neighbour told ABC7 that she wasn't even aware anyone was living at the home until she saw an ambulance and fire truck.

In the lengthy Facebook message, Hines said: 'Yes I was deceitful Yes I was a DOG, as women would call unfaithful men and yes I was very dishonest when it came to cheating and other women. But I had made it clear to Tatjana that were not in a monogamous relationship anymore...'

Hines also alleged that Miss Cruz's fragile mental state played a role in the breakdown of the couple's relationship.

'I am truly sorry about this and I do not have the heart to say I don't deserve what you all want to happen to me...'

He wrote: 'When she went into Rage because I wanted to leave the relationship one time and threatened to kill her self in the bathroom with the children at her side, cutting her own face with butcher knives. Writing letters saying she would jump off bearvalley bridge.

'It was only me that wiped the blood and the tears and couldn't leave her, feeling like I was the fault for this not knowing her problems began a long time before me.'

The 23-year-old also used the message to later deny he had killed the mother of his unborn child.

He added: 'I am truly sorry about this and I do not have the heart to say I don't deserve what you all want to happen to me but I will say I Love Tatjana but I did not beat her to death.'
