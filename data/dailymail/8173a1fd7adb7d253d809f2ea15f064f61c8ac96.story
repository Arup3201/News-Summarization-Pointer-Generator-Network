A small town in Ohio has become the epicenter of an insect invasion of biblical proportions.

Residents in the affluent Cleveland suburb of Rocky River awoke Wednesday morning to discover their cars, buildings and parking lots covered in a thick humming layer of mayflies.

The critters, which also go by the name Canadian soldiers, do not bite and are not harmful, and luckily for those who live in Rocky River, they only live for a couple of days.

Good sign: Experts say the presence of swarms of mayflies points to the fact that Lake Erie is healthy

The insects appear on the shores of Lake Erie each June in huge black swarms, and experts say their presence is a sign that the lake is healthy, according to Cleveland.com.

While the bugs are large and can be a nuisance, people are urged not to kill them because they omit an unpleasant fishy odor when squashed.

Mayflies are an important source of nutrition for many species, including a wide variety of fish and birds.  

Each year during early and mid-June, millions of mayflies hatch and sprout wings and then blanket street lamps, store windows, screen doors and just about anything they can cling to in cities such as Cleveland, Sandusky and Port Clinton and parts of the Toledo area.

They’re an annoyance because they stick to clothes and sometimes land in hair.

The mayfly population goes through cycles, said Don Schloesser, a researcher at the Great Lakes Science Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

There were about 150 mayflies per square meter in 2012, while last year the density was half that, he told The Blade newspaper in Toledo.

It’s not clear why there has been a change. The brutal winter and cool weather this spring could have delayed the emergence of the insects that survived.

‘If you don’t see them by the first week of July, you should kind of assume that they’re not coming this year,’ Schloesser said.

Decaying algae that takes away oxygen in the lake might have caused the mayflies to suffocate, said Justin Chaffin, a research coordinator at Ohio State University’s Stone Laboratory.

Workers in the city of Port Clinton are shutting off streetlights earlier so the bright lights don’t attract the insects. In many years, the swarms are so thick that business owners use leaf blowers to remove them from buildings and sidewalks.

Mayflies typically live for a day or two before dying. But the life cycle actually lasts two years.

Mayflies begin as eggs on the water’s surface before the eggs sink to the bottom of the lake. The larvae hatch and burrow into the mud. Later, they wriggle out of their burrows and take off from the water.

‘We haven’t seen them in full force like we have in years past,’ said Blanca Stransky, superintendent of Perry’s Victory & International Peace Memorial on South Bass Island.
