A child rape case that sparked 
allegations of interference by a district attorney - the son of TV's Judge Judy - has ended with the acquittal of his 
close friend.

A Putnam 
County jury found Alexandru Hossu not guilty on Thursday on two counts 
each of first- and second-degree rape of a 13-year-old girl.

The
 county's district attorney, Adam Levy, recused himself from the case in
 March 2013, saying Hossu was a close friend and frequent houseguest. 
Westchester County prosecutors took over.

A Putnam County jury found Alexandru Hossu not guilty on Thursday on two counts each of first- and second-degree rape of a 13-year-old girl

But
 Putnam Sheriff Donald Smith, a fellow Republican and a political rival,
 said Levy was interfering with the prosecution.

Smith said that if Levy
 had his way, 'Mr. Hossu would never have been brought to justice for 
his crime and Mr. Levy's relationship with him would never have been 
brought to the light of public scrutiny.'

Levy
 sued the sheriff for $5 million, claiming defamation and calling Smith 'an out-of-control sheriff who does not care about the truth.' Smith 
denied defaming Levy. The case is pending.

Levy's
 mother, Judy Sheindlin, is the star of Judge Judy and issued a 
statement at the time calling her son 'principled, honorable and 
dedicated.'

Alexandru Hossu, a 36-year-old immigrant from Romania , was a former personal trainer of Adam Levy, pictured right with his mom Judge Judy

On Thursday she said: 'The 12 people who had the opportunity
 to evaluate the demeanor and credibility of the witnesses delivered 
their verdict. I can only hope that having been acquitted, that Alex can
 get his life back.'

In 
October, Levy acknowledged he had helped pay for Hossu's defense. And he
 said he doubted Hossu could hurt a child. Levy's brother-in-law 
eventually took over the defense.

In November, the prosecutor on the case told the judge Levy was interfering. Some local politicians called for an investigation.

Levy,
 however, said he had fulfilled his 'ethical, moral and legal 
obligations' by recusing himself and cooperating with the prosecution. 
No charges have been filed against Levy.

Hossu,
 a 36-year-old immigrant from Romania who also is Levy's former personal
 trainer, was accused of raping the daughter of his former girlfriend.

At
 the trial in Carmel, 50 miles north of Manhattan, the girl testified 
that Hossu raped her in 2010. She said he 'snapped' when she refused his
 offer for help with her homework.

Hossu
 did not take the stand, but the evidence included a phone call from the
 girl to Hossu last year, made at the suggestion of prosecutors and 
recorded without Hossu's knowledge.

On the call, he denied the assault 
and called the allegations ridiculous.

Jurors heard him say, 'I never touched you in an inappropriate manner.'

On
 Wednesday, after three hours of deliberation, the jury reported it was 
deadlocked, but the judge said to keep trying for a verdict.

A
 spokeswoman for Levy, Michelle Carter, referred a call for comment to 
the Westchester district attorney's office.

A spokesman there, Lucian 
Chalfen, said, 'The jury heard all the evidence and gave it due 
consideration, as evidenced by the length of their deliberations and the
 fact they were initially deadlocked.'

Hossu's immigration status is under investigation, and he remained in custody.
