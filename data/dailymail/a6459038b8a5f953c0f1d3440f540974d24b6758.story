Paul Lambert admits the only way to convince Aston Villa's critics is to start winning.

The Villa manager has come under fire with home fans calling for his head for the first time during their FA Cup win over Blackpool on Sunday.

Villa have scored 11 goals in 20 Barclays Premier League games and netted just three times in their last six outings.

They head to Leicester on Saturday 12th in the table but five points above the relegation zone and Lambert knows only victories will sway the doubters.

'It is never nice to hear (criticism from fans),' he said, after five league wins this term.'It probably won't help the team when they hear that but you can't stop anybody shouting, the only way is by winning.

'But the last three games has seen teams sit in against us.It is difficult to break that down but we have had chances. If you look at the first minutes of games we have had chances and if they go in it becomes a different game.

'We have to find that creativity spark to unlock it when it is as tight as that. We had 752 passes against Blackpool and we had 69 per cent possession and 60 per cent of that was in their half, so it is not as if we are playing in our own half.

'If teams sit in you have to be patient and knock on the door.Leicester being the home team, maybe they will come at us. But if you are to do any good in football though you have to have a strong defensive corner stone.

'We are the fifth best in the league which indicates we are doing something right there. The last thing is get it right in the final third and be more dynamic.'

Ron Vlaar has been ruled out for up to six weeks with a knee injury - although that means the out-of-contract skipper is likely to stay in January.

Gabby Agbonlahor is back after a minor hamstring injury forced him out of the 1-0 win over Blackpool.

Lambert was full of praise for Colombian Carlos Sanchez hailing the midfielder as 'a big part of our game'

And Lambert has praised midfielder Carlos Sanchez and believes the Colombian is a key man for Villa.

'The other week against Crystal Palace the only other player in the Premier League who out-passed him was Yaya Toure,' he said. 'Even against Blackpool I think Carlos had 127 passes.

'He is a massive part of our game and the keepers too. I think he has been brilliant and is really intelligent.

'He is a top player Carlos and is an absolute gem of a guy. He is has a first class attitude and is a great trainer. He trains the way he plays.'
