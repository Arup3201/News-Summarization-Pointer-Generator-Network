Mesdames et messieurs, meet Jean Louis! Middle England’s favourite retailer is to turn on the Gallic charm.

Booming department store group John Lewis is to launch a French language website that will take payments in euros.

Since its inception, the retailer has focused on the British shopper.

But now, as part of ambitious new expansion plans, it aims to launch a dedicated French and German language website in 2014 – its 150th anniversary year.

Customers in 33 countries are already able to buy from the firm’s website if they pay in pounds and can speak the language – items are shipped by courier.

France, Germany and Australia are the best-performing countries.

But managing director Andy Street wants to go further.

He has tested a shop within a South Korean department store, and is in talks to team up with other prestigious retailers around the world to either license the brand, or wholesale some of the chain’s distinctive own-brand products.

Early festive figures show John Lewis posted a 6.9 per cent rise in sales for the five weeks to December 28, down on the same period last year

A spokesman said: ‘It is genuinely our aspiration to launch the French site by the end of the year.’  

Its international push follows in the footsteps of sister firm Waitrose which has enjoyed success through licensing deals and selling goods abroad.
