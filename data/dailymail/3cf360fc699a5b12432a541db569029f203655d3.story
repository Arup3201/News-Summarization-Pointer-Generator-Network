Two Argentine football fans died from heart attacks during their nation's World Cup semi-final penalty shoot-out with the Netherlands, it has emerged.

Erik Tench, 16, and Gustavo Daniel Hofer, 49, both suffered deadly cardiac arrests as they watched their team dump the Dutch side out of the tournament after a tense match on Wednesday night.

The win sparked wild celebrations across Argentina, that began to warm up when goalkeeper Sergio Romero saved Holland's first spot-kick from Ron Vlaar.

Passion: Gustavo Daniel Hofer (not pictured), 49, also died shortly after the game when he suffered a heart attack in the central city of Marcos Juarez while celebrating the historic victory

A little more than 700km away, in Marcos Juarez, Hofer also died shortly after the game.

The newspaper distributor suffered a fatal heart attack in the central city while celebrating the historic victory as fans ran through the streets cheering their side's historic victory.

The country erupted into a fever of celebration after the Argentinian side finally saw off their Dutch rivals 4-2 on penalties after a nervy 0-0 draw in Sao Paulo.

Holland's shootout went from bad to worse as Ron Vlaar was unable to convert the first penalty thanks to a reflex save by Sergio Romero. Then Wesley Sneijder compounded his side's woes by missing his spot kick moments later.

Argentina, meanwhile, scored all four penalties to secure their place in the World Cup final against Germany in the Maracana Stadium on Sunday.
