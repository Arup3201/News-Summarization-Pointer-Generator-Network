Miley Cyrus went from punk to polished at last night's Maxim Hot 100 party, wearing a strapless Valentino jumpsuit that seems to be a favorite of A-list event-attending celebrities.

The $2,980 jumpsuit, available at Saks Fifth Avenue, was first worn by Gwyneth Paltrow, who was celebrating her 40th birthday, in October last year.

Then a few months later, Lena Dunham wore the jumpsuit for the season two premiere of Girls in January.

And just a two weeks ago, Jamie
Tisch and actress Katherine Castro both showed up wearing the 
jumpsuit to a gala for Mrs Tisch's
Entertainment Industry's Women's Cancer Research Fund.

Made of silk, the black streamlined one-piece features a large white bow at the back, lending a graphic element to the otherwise minimalistic monochrome design.

While Miss Cyrus, 20, teamed her jumpsuit with a bold red lip and Saint Laurent heels, Miss Dunham, 27, also sporting a pixie cut, went for natural make-up and classic black pumps - letting her purple nails make a statement.

Ms Paltrow, 40, who wore the jumpsuit 
before it stores, glided down New York's 2nd Avenue in patent Christian 
Louboutin pumps with a high, slicked back ponytail on her way to the 
restaurant, Elio's, for her birthday on October 5th.

Mrs Tisch, married to executive vice 
president of the New York Giants, Steve Tisch, wore the Valentino 
jumpsuit with her blond locks styled in Hollywood waves.

And Miss Castro,
who is currently executive producing and acting in the independent 
science-fiction thriller Subject 7, opted for pink lipstick and open-toe
black pumps.

Pricey purchase: The $2,980 jumpsuit, available at Saks, is made of silk; the streamlined one-piece features a large white bow at the back, lending a graphic element to the otherwise minimalistic monochrome design

The jumpsuit, only available in U.S. 6 and 10, has nearly sold out on Saks.com, despite its hefty price tag.

Valentino designers Maria Grazia 
Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli, whose luxuriously embellished creations 
have revitalized the French fashion house, gravitated towards a more 
spare aesthetic for their fall 2013 collection.

And the monochrome palette, also seen on dresses, capes, skirt suits and pant outfits, appears to be a hit with Hollywood.

Jamie Tisch and rising star Katherine Castro also showed up wearing the Valentino jumpsuit to a New York benefit earlier this month
