An ex-principal and former Australian of the Year finalist who fraudulently claimed millions of taxpayers' dollars for a top Indigenous school will not spend anymore time behind bars.

In an 11th-hour plea last Monday, Jean Illingworth admitted defrauding the state and Commonwealth by inflating student numbers to get $3.4 million in extra funding for Djarragun College, near Cairns, between 2010 and 2011.

On Friday, the 67-year-old appeared in the Cairns District Court where she was sentenced to three years' jail on one charge of obtaining property by deception, and two and half years' on one charge of fraud.

However, Judge Terry Martin ordered she only serve 351 days in prison for both charges - the exact number of days she has already served in pre-sentence custody.

"I accept you're fundamentally a decent person," Judge Martin said, adding that he acknowledged she had dedicated most of her life to helping indigenous and disadvantaged children.

He described her convictions as a major stain on an enviable career but added that she had abandoned honesty and integrity and "committed blatant fraud".

Judge Martin acknowledged her motivation was the improvement of the school and the benefit of the students rather than personal gain.

Supporters of the disgraced teacher, 66, are standing by her and have already helped raise $31,829 towards her legal fees for the trial. She will face one charge each of fraud and obtaining financial advantage by deception.

Her backers have so far donated 40 per cent of the target amount reportedly needed to defend her against the fraud claims.

The fundraising website 'Defend Jean' claims: 'Jean Illingworth worked tirelessly at Djarragun College for ten years, turning a small dysfunctional school into a flagship example of successful indigenous education.'

It claims: 'The very least Jean deserves is a fair trial. The legal costs involved in achieving this are almost prohibitive.'

Ms Illingworth, once described by Noel Pearson as a true social entrepreneur, wept throughout her sentencing.

Prosecutor Michael Cowan said Illingworth claimed funding for hundreds of students who weren't eligible because they hadn't attended school for a minimum period.

He read a number of emails to the court that he said proved she knew what she had done.

Mr Cowan said Illingworth had cost taxpayers millions that would never be recovered while receiving a $283,000 salary until at least July this year.

Role model: Ms Illingworth was named Queensland's Senior Australian of the Year in 2009

Her barrister, Ken Fleming, argued his client shouldn't spend anymore time behind bars, pointing to Illingworth's impressive work history in which she'd spent most of her life working with remote, indigenous and disadvantaged children in Australia and Africa.

Illingworth, who worked at the college for about a decade, was named the Queensland Senior Australian of the Year in 2009 for her work in transforming the once dysfunctional college into a much admired model of success.

Mr Fleming said Illingworth worked 15 hours a day to turn the school - her grand passion - into a place where some of the country's most disadvantaged children were given hope of a brighter future.

He also outlined the extraordinary challenges the school and its students faced, including foetal alcohol syndrome, truancy problems and a lack of parental support.

"The school has been an enormous success and principally because of the untiring work of Ms Illingworth," he said.

Djarragun College is a private school that has two campuses - north and south of Cairns - and caters mainly to indigenous students from Cape York and the Torres Strait.

Ms Illingworth's lawyers still have the option to apply for a judge-only trial or request jurors be polled to see if they are biased due to publicity surrounding the case.

The 66-year-old has been in custody in a Townsville women's prison for almost a year.

She was released on bail after being charged early last year but was then taken into custody in July after allegedly contacting witnesses in the trial.

A separate trial relating to these alleged offences - she has been charged with two counts of perverting the course of justice - may take place in November.
