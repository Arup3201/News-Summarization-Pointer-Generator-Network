A father-of-three who was left profoundly deaf after a doctor failed to recognise he had symptoms associated with meningities has blasted the GP for leaving him in 'total isolation'.

Peter Lovell first began to feel unwell with an earache and headache on September 28, 2008.

The next day the 48-year-old felt a pop in his ear which led to a discharge of blood before his symptoms worsened later that evening.

His wife Judy, 44, became so concerned that she called the out-of-hours GP service at 10.50pm which led to a call back from a doctor called Patrick Fingleton.

Stricken: Father-of-three Peter Lovell  with wife Judie in a picture taken one week before the meningitis struck. He has now won a £500,000 payout after his symptoms were not recognised - with devastating consequences

The GP ran through the symptoms with Mr Lovell before saying it sounded like he had an ear infection and the ear drum had perforated.

But despite stressing the severity of his headache and other symptoms, Dr Fingleton advised him to book in with his regular GP the next morning.

Incredibly, he also told Mr Lovell he may just need antibiotics and even said '12 hours isn't going to make any difference to it'.

But the patient was rushed to Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital the next day after he was violently sick and collapsed at home.

He was admitted to intensive care after being diagnosed with meningitis which was later confirmed to be secondary to a middle ear infection known as otitis media.

And after being in a coma for eight days, he woke up to find he was completely deaf and suffering from severe tinnitus in both ears.

The meningitis had also caused neurological damage which meant he was suffering from problems with balance and memory loss.

Mr Lovell even thought his 20 and 18-year-old children were only two and six-weeks-old and couldn't remember having a three-year-old daughter at the time.

Medical law experts discovered that if he had been admitted to hospital in the immediate hours after the phone call, intravenous antibiotics would have prevented the meningitis from developing and causing the profound deafness.

They also found that Dr Fingleton breached his duty of care by failing to consider the symptoms were suggestive of a middle ear infection that has a risk of multiple complications including meningitis.

He also wrongly concluded that a middle ear infection could be safely excluded without a medical examination.

And the GP even failed to take a full history of Mr Lovell's symptoms which would have identified the need for an urgent hospital referral for appropriate treatment.

Insurers representing Dr Fingleton refused to agree an admission of liability but they have now agreed to pay a £500,000 settlement.

The money will cover his on-going treatment costs and specialist hearing equipment - as well as cover his loss of earnings as he had to give up his job as a fireplace manufacturer.

Today Mr Lovell, who is originally from Salcombe Regis in Devon but now lives in Andover, Hampshire, said he is frustrated that he has received no apology from the GP.

He added: 'I could not have imagined the total isolation that sudden profound deafness can bring and I doubt I will ever really get used to it.

'The tinnitus is probably the worst part as it is just constant and loud in my head. It never stops and I get very frustrated.

'My little girl was only three when I became deaf so I never got to hear her read or speak properly which I have found very upsetting.

'Given all of this I feel I am at least entitled to an apology and for the doctor to hold his hands up and admit he should have done more for me, but not once has this been forthcoming.

'It's very hard not to feel some element of resentment towards him.

'Another major effect of my injuries is how they have stopped me from working which has obviously had a huge financial impact on the entire family.

'However, the settlement will ease the financial pressure we have faced over the last six years and I'm looking forward to having access to therapy, equipment and coping strategies that will make communication easier for me and the family.

'Although this amount of money won't last a lifetime it has enabled us to purchase a house outright so we will never have to worry about rent or mortgages again giving me peace of mind that my wife and children will be secure if anything were to happen to me.'

If Mr Lovell had been admitted to hospital in the immediate hours after the phone call, intravenous antibiotics would have prevented the meningitis from developing and causing the profound deafness

Life-changing: After being in a coma for eight days, he woke up to find he was completely deaf and suffering from severe tinnitus in both ears.

Medical law experts at Irwin Mitchell secured the settlement from Dr Fingleton - who worked for Devon Doctors Ltd - just months before the case was due to go to trial.

Natalie Jones, who represented Mr Lovell, said: 'Thankfully the settlement will provide financial stability as well as access to specialist equipment and therapies to help Peter communicate more easily.

'All medical staff, including GPs and out-of-hours doctors, must ensure they are aware of the potentially serious complications that come with middle ear infection to ensure sufferers are given the appropriate treatment as quickly as possible to prevent anyone else suffering like Peter.'

Dr Patrick Fingleton said: 'I am sorry that the patient has these unfortunate health difficulties and, although it cannot turn back the clock, I hope the recent settlement goes some way towards helping the patient with his future needs.

'Although I cannot comment further due to patient confidentiality, I can assure my patients their welfare is always my first concern.'

Devon Doctors - who Dr Fingleton was working for at the time - apologised to the father-of-three.

A spokeswoman said: 'Devon Doctors would like the opportunity to apologise to Mr Lovell.

'We became aware in February 2011 Mr Lovell was making legal enquiries. We have been informed this has since led to an out of court settlement between the GP and Mr Lovell.

'Whilst we have not been involved with these legal proceedings we apologise most sincerely to Mr Lovell and his family for any clinical failure.'

Dr Fingleton was working as a sessional GP at the time of the incident but is not currently doing shifts for Devon Doctors.

He said: 'I am sorry that the patient has these unfortunate health difficulties and, although it cannot turn back the clock, I hope the recent settlement goes some way towards helping the patient with his future needs.

'Although I cannot comment further due to patient confidentiality, I can assure my patients their welfare is always my first concern.'
