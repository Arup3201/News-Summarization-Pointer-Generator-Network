A rare 200-year-old coin which was hidden for half a century in a tiny cabinet made of matchboxes has sold for £225,700 - a staggering 72 million times its face value.

The U.S. copper half cent was minted in 1796 and was one of just 1,400 ever struck. It was picked out of a hoard of 70 coins by an expert after being taken to an auction house in Wiltshire.

The collection had been gathered by Oxford student Mark Hillary, who died aged 20 in 1963 in a climbing accident.

The rare 200-year-old coin which sold for £225,700 was hidden in a matchbox for 50 years

The bulk of his collection was sold at auction years ago, but the 70 leftover coins remained hidden at his former home for almost 50 years.

It was not until family members had an attic clear-out that the 18th century coin was discovered. The half cent bears a liberty head design on one side, with a pole and liberty cap in the background.

The reverse side of the copper coin, which is in mint condition, shows an open wreath of olive stems tied with a ribbon.

Heads or tails: The family of Mark Hillary were 'chuffed' at their luck in finding the 1796 coin in their attic

The auction saw huge interest from 
American bidders and the half cent sold to The Numismatic Financial 
Corporation in Florida which buys and sells rare coins.

The
hammer price for the coin, that is one inch in diameter, was 
£185,000 but with additional fees included the overall price was £225,700.

Mr Hillary's family attended the sale and said they were 'very excited and chuffed to bits' with the outcome.

The
coin was struck in pure copper at 
the Philadelphia Mint and designed by the mint's first chief engraver 
Robert Scott.

Daniel 
Fearon, a coin consultant at Salisbury-based Woolley and Wallis 
auctioneers, said: 'It is a wonderful result and a satisfying ending to 
an amazing find.

'It
was very exciting when it was brought in to us. It is an instantly 
recognisable and beautiful coin. I'm so pleased to have found it.

'The
condition of the coin is unchanged with a good even brown colour and 
some traces of redness around the obverse letters and around wreath on 
the reverse.

'The coin is 
one of just a handful that have survived in this condition. Half cents 
have always been a rarity in the collectors' market.

'Britain is just the place where you 
could expect to find one. The best specimens of American coins have 
surfaced over the years in British collections.

'There
was no local collecting market in America in those early days but in 
Britain the 1790's was a time when copper coinage and copper trade 
tokens were widely collected.

'It is the natural place for coins of the former colony to end up.'

Mr Hillary was a classical scholar who attended both Winchester College and Magdalen College, Oxford.

He was on his way to achieving a first class degree in classical greats when he died in a climbing accident in Greece.

He had collected coins since childhood and his passion often took him to the London coin dealers Spink's and Seaby's.

Half cent coins were never popular and mintage was often low because priority was given to the new gold and silver coins.
