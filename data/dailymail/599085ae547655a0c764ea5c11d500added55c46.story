A former paratrooper who  witnessed the unlawful Bloody  Sunday killings is set to tell police investigating the shootings how he saw a British soldier ‘lose the plot’ and fire indiscriminately in a residential area.

The retired Para, who is to be interviewed as part of a criminal inquiry into the deaths of 14 civil rights protesters, will describe how a soldier rattled off 20 rounds as he fired from the hip towards a block of flats before being ordered to ‘cease fire’.

The ex-Para, who cannot be named for security reasons, will be among the first Bloody Sunday veterans to provide testimony as part of a criminal investigation into the events of January 30, 1972.

The interview will take place next month at a secret location in Britain.

The anonymous former member of the Parachute Regiment said he saw soldiers 'shooting from the hip' but only after they were fired upon by the IRA

The investigation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has been widely criticised as politically motivated and against the public interest. It comes four years after the £250 million Saville Inquiry into Bloody Sunday produced  its findings.

Following the report, the decision whether to prosecute any individual soldier was left to the PSNI.The soldiers now facing questions have long since retired and are in their 60s and 70s.

The investigation comes after it emerged that convicted IRA terrorists received Royal pardons and letters from the Government assuring them that they will not face further legal action.

Up to 200 former soldiers face being formally questioned by police for alleged murder, attempted murder or criminal injury.

The ex-Para told last night how two or three soldiers ‘lost the plot’ on the day, but he insisted that troops reacted only after IRA  members fired sub-machine guns at them first.

He said: ‘I will give the police an entirely unbiased account of what I saw, including the incident of the soldier rattling off 20 rounds from his magazine towards a block of flats. He was shooting indiscriminately. Fortunately nobody was injured or killed by his actions.

‘I will tell the police how, before any British soldiers opened fire, the IRA fired at us and that, unquestionably, there was a genuine threat to our lives. Lord Saville’s report painted an unfair picture of the Parachute Regiment because the conclusions were so dismissive of the active role played by the IRA that day. They were firing Thompson sub-machine guns.’

The ex-Para has agreed to meet  PSNI officers next month. Fearful that his identity could be leaked to Republican terrorists, the veteran has insisted that police officers do not visit him at his home.

He said PSNI detectives have indicated that they are ‘looking for prosecutions’. But in building cases against UK soldiers they cannot  use evidence given to the Saville Inquiry – because its aim was not to accuse individuals or institutions such as the Army.

Instead, the PSNI must obtain fresh witness statements from soldiers who were present that day.Last year the Ministry of Defence began hiring lawyers to represent Paras interviewed under caution  or charged with criminal offences.

Paras who engaged with protesters could be found guilty of  murder based on the evidence of anonymous witnesses.

It will be left up to courts to decide whether witnesses such as the veteran who spoke to The Mail on Sunday can remain anonymous.

The PSNI was unavailable for comment. The MoD said: ‘It is for the PSNI to decide whether to look into these allegations. If they do,  we will support them fully with  their investigation.’
