One of the closest friends of Madonna Badger, whose three children and parents perished in a fire at her home on Christmas morning, has revealed how she is coping with the loss.

Fashion executive Michelle Kessler-Sanders said Badger, who owned the Stamford, Connecticut property, was being comforted by her close circle of friends from the industry.

And she said she was confident Badger will pull through as she comes to terms with the loss of two generations of her family.

Mrs Badger barely escaped from the blaze that claimed her parents, Lomer 
Johnson, 71, and Pauline, 69, and her three daughters – Lily, 10,
and 7-year-old twins Grace and Sarah.

Her boyfriend Michael Borcina, a contractor who was renovating the Victoria house, also survived.

'It's so awful, ' Kessler-Sanders said. 'But here's what I know about Madonna Badger: she is the strongest woman I've ever known in my life, throughout our 20-year friendship.

'I could not handle this myself. But she will find a way to do good things in her life because of this. It will take time, obviously.'

In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, the executive vice president and creative director of the Vera Wang Group said she was speaking with the family's permission.

She said friends of Badger, 45, were struggling to come to terms with the devastating fire at the Connecticut home.

'I don't even know how to describe to you how this is for me,' she said.

'For all her friends, it's almost inconceivable. But she has an amazing network of friends who have all shown up.

'That first day after the fire, we were all together. The children's father, Matthew Badger, is going through this in his own way, very privately.

'But there has been an enormous outpouring for Madonna. You can't possibly say anything to comfort a person in this time. You just have to be there and sit with her. Be there so she knows she's not alone.

'She is being cared for by the right people, close friends. She is not alone.'

Kessler-Sanders said she learned of the tragedy from a friend.

'I couldn't absorb it,' she says. 'But over the last couple days, you realize - it's epic,' she said.

Tragic: Fire officials are unsure whether the property was correctly fitted with activated fire alarms

It comes as Mrs Badger's boyfriend, 
Mr Borcina, uttered words of hope before he left the hospital where he 
was being treated for smoke inhalation.

'We’re going to be OK,' the contractor, 52, said. 'We’re just trying to stay positive.'

Other family members are equally distraught by the tragedy and are trying to make sense of it all.

Victims:

granddaughters, Grace, Lily and Sarah (all pictured) perished in a fire 
on Christmas morning after fireplace embers caught the house alight

Campbell Badger said his brother 
Matthew was devoted to his three daughters and added that the family is 
appreciative of the outpouring of public sympathy.

‘Matthew is devastated,’ Mr Badger 
told the Associated Press Wednesday. ‘He’s doing as best as can be 
expected under the circumstances.’

He said his three nieces were ‘wonderful, delightful energetic children’.

‘They were loved tremendously by their mother and their father, who always put the kids first,’ he said.

Mr Badger and Madonna Badger had been
separated for three years, but remained good friends, relatives told 
the New York Times. The Badgers started divorce proceedings in October 
this year.

Floral bouquets, stuffed animals, and
candles have been left outside the torn-down Victorian home by 
passers-by and others wishing to express their condolences.

All five victims died of smoke inhalation, the Connecticut medical examiner said Wednesday.

Mr Johnson also suffered a blunt head
and neck injury, which could have resulted from a fall, according to 
the medical examiner’s office.

All the deaths were ruled accidental. 
Stamford fire officials said Tuesday that embers in a bag of discarded 
fireplace ashes started the fire.

The
house should not have even been occupied, fire and city officials have 
said, as fire alarms did not appear to have been activated, and the 
property did not have an inspection certificate.

But
as authorities on Tuesday described the chaotic scene, it emerged two 
of the girls were painfully close to safety, but instead turned around 
in a moment of panic, becoming trapped in the furious blaze.

Led by their mother's boyfriend from 
their third-floor bedroom to the second floor, the girls reportedly 
bolted back into the flames.

Stamford Fire Chief Antonio Conte 
said: 'You have to realise with that amount of heat and smoke how scared
those children must have been. They just left him.'

Flames quickly entered the house, 
spread throughout the first floor and licked upstairs, trapping the 
girls. Outside, their mother frantically tried to direct firefighters to
her doomed family, but was unaware her daughters had moved.

Two of the girls were found on the 
second floor; their other sister died just feet from escaping through a window.

Officials at the press conference 
could not confirm whether or not the family would have survived if the 
home had been fitted with activated smoke alarms. It would depend on the
direction the wind was blowing the smoke, they said.

They added that investigations are in
the early stages and that Mrs Badger was not in the right state of mind
to answer their questions.

Witnesses said Mrs Badger was heard saying: 'My whole life is in there.'

Kessler-Sanders
recalled she first met Badger when they worked for Calvin Klein in the 
press department. Another colleague was Carolyn Bessette who later 
married John Kennedy Jr.

She
said: 'Madonna was the art director, she conceived of the whole Marky 
Mark/Calvin Klein campaign, which is so iconic. It was an incredible 
time at the company. I think even Calvin Klein would say that.

'Madonna
and I stayed very close. I had her baby shower for her first daughter, 
Lily. We stayed very close throughout all of our mutual pregnancies. She
had my baby shower for me when my son was born. She was the very first 
person who came to the hospital.

Aftermath: Investigators examine the roof of the house which collapsed during the deadly fire in Stamford

Trapped: The family of two adults and three children were trapped on the second floor when the fire broke as they slept in their bed at 5am on Christmas morning

'Although, since she moved to Connecticut, we didn't see each other as much, we remained connected as old friends do.'

Family members have also paid tribute to the Johnsons, who would have celebrated their 49th wedding anniversary on Monday.

Mr Johnson had worked in his 'dream job' as a Saks Fifth Avenue Santa Claus the day before he died.

'That’s all he ever wanted to be,' a family member told the New York Times. 'He stopped shaving the day he retired.'

'It
is a terrible, terrible day for the city of Stamford,' Mayor Michael 
Pavia told reporters at a news briefing at the scene of the fire.

'There probably has not been a worse Christmas day in the city of Stamford.'
