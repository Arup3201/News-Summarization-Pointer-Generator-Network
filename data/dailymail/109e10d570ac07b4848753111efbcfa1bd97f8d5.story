A 26-year-old who was desperate to have children was killed by her IVF treatment just weeks after getting pregnant.

Emma Draper, from Dagenham in Essex, had been trying for a baby for two years with husband Peter so they were delighted when the IVF worked almost immediately.

Four days after the good news, however, she was taken to hospital with stabbing chest pains and died from thrombosis in hospital when several of her organs failed.

Devastated: Emma Draper's husband Peter said he did not even want to live after her death

At risk: The 26-year-old had a pre-existing blood condition, which left her in danger of life-threatening clots

Her devastated widower Peter, 33, said: 'When she died, I kissed her on the forehead and said, "I love you so much. I always will."

'I felt as if my life had ended too - I didn’t want to live without my Emma.'

Tests later revealed that the death of the former personal shopper was 
triggered by complications with medication she was taking for a 
pre-existing blood condition.

Mr Draper claims they were never warned of the danger and he is now taking legal action against the doctors involved.

The couple began IVF treatment on a GP's recommendation at St Bart’s
 Hospital in London in June 2010, after struggling to conceive, even 
after Mrs Draper lost five stone in a bid to improve their chances.

She received an embryo transfer on June 
11 and the couple were over the moon when a pregnancy test came back 
positive 14 days later.

Fatal stroke: Mr Draper is taking legal action against doctors because his wife died after switching blood-thinning drugs in the hope of a safer pregnancy

The young woman had suffered all her life with anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS), which makes the blood prone to dangerous clotting.

Her family claim she was never warned that complications in IVF can prove fatal in sufferers of APS.

She had been taking anti-coagulant drug warfarin since she had a clot in her lung in 
2001.

Warfarin is known 
to have a damaging effect on a developing foetus so she was switched to a heparin drug for the duration of her pregnancy.

This, however, was not as effective as Warfarin at thinning her blood.

Just four days after the positive pregnancy test, Mrs Draper was admitted to specialist heart hospital Papworth Hospital in Cambridge.

She slipped into a coma, her legs turned blue and she suffered a massive stroke, which left doctors no choice but to turn off her life support machine on July 10, 2010.

Happy times: The Drapers had been trying for a baby for two years before turning to IVF on the recommendation of her GP

An inquest in February 2011 ruled that a combination of antiphospholipid syndrome and IVF meant Emma developed the very rare catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome - a chance of less than one in 100.

The coroner at Poplar Coroner’s Court ruled: 'Emma Louise Draper died from Natural Causes, which presented as a rare complication of pre-existing disease and fertility treatment.'

Mr Draper, a van driver who is still coming to terms with the death of his wife, added: 'I can’t help feeling angry.

'Blood specialists warned us there was a risk of clotting from changing Emma’s medication, but nobody told us that IVF could be life-threatening.

'It’s meant to be something that brings life into this world, not takes it away.

'Emma was sensible - she would never have had IVF if she’d known that there was a chance she might die.

'We would have adopted.'

St Bart’s Hospital said in a statement: 'This is a tragic case and our thoughts are with the Draper family at this difficult time.

'An inquest held in February 2011 found that Emma died from natural causes, which presented as a rare complication of pre-existing disease and fertility treatment.'
