Sometimes dogs need attention at the most inappropriate times, as this new video shows.

Chris McConnell from Portland, Oregon, was filmed as he performed push-ups at home with Jasmine the puppy excitedly administering him with ticklish licks.

As he attempts to workout, the pooch writhes around under Chris' shirtless torso, triggering a torrent of laughter.

Distraction: As he attempts to work-out, the pooch writhes around under Chris' shirtless torso, triggering a torrent of laughter 

Chris can barely make the third push-up as Jasmine rolls around him.

She manically licks his armpits before attempting to give his face a quick wash. 

At one point she even pats his derriere with a paw.

Chris manages to keep going despite the interruption.

At push-up number five Jasmine scampers off and decides she's had enough.

Spank you! At one point she even pats his derriere with a paw

Chris and his brother Matt adopted seven-month-old Jasmine from an animal rescue shelter last fall as a birthday present for their father.

They say that the Australian Shepherd Newfoundland mix is 'very energetic' and 'loves to play around.' 

Matt said of the recent video of her in action: 'She either wanted to make it harder for my brother or she wanted to join in on the workout.'

Clearly Jasmine's game for more than just a walk in the park.
