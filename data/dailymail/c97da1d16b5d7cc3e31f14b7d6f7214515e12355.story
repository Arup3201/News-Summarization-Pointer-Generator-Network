While Juventus find themselves assuredly top of Serie A, their last 16 Champions League opponents Borussia Dortmund, sit a very modest 12th in the Bundesliga.

In fact, Dortmund were actually bottom of the table until a run of three wins in their last three games lifted them off it; but even that little upturn shouldn't detract from what a disappointing league campaign it has been for Jurgen Klopp's men so far.    

Juve midfielder Arturo Vidal, however, insists that neither the threat nor inherent quality of Dortmund has waned; and says that the Turin club must still respect BVB, who will be determined to atone for their poor domestic showing on the continent.

Jurgen Klopp's side are currently a disappointing 12th place in the Bundesliga table 

Vidal told German football magazine Kicker, 'Dortmund's league woes make them even more dangerous, because they will be focusing their efforts on the Champions League.' 

'They'll want to show that their Bundesliga place doesn't represent their enormous quality and is merely a deceptive snapshot.' 

He added, 'The strength of Klopp's team isn't individual players, but the unity of the team, the pressing game they play out, their superior technique on the ball and the crazy pace they show.'

Vidal has rejected the idea that Italian football is not as strong as it once was

Vidal also rejected the notion that Italian football is not as strong as it once was and even suggested that Juventus boasted one of the world's best midfields in himself, Paul Pogba and Claudio Marchisio. 

'Juve's midfield is definitely in the top three out there, but now we have to prove it on the pitch in the Champions League,' he said.  

Despite that lofty claim, though, Vidal could not hide his admiration for Dortmund playmaker Marco Reus.  

'If I could sign any Dortmund player it would be Reus. He's a really great footballer. But he just signed a renewal with Dortmund...'
