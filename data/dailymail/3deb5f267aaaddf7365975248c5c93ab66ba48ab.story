A sacked PCSO who is suing London's Metropolitan Police for discrimination has successfully argued

Rachida Sobhi is suing Scotland Yard for disability discrimination after she was turned down when applying to become a PC due to failing a background check which revealed that she had a criminal record for stealing

she did not know she had amnesia when she failed to declare a conviction for theft.

But a tribunal has reserved its decision on several key points that will determine whether her claims against the police force are ultimately successful.

Rachida Sobhi, 43, took the Metropolitan Police to court after she was denied a role as a police constable in December 2009, claiming she was discriminated against because of a disability.

She was denied the job - and has since been sacked - because she was reprimanded earlier that year for failing to declare a conditional discharge for theft in 1991.

But Ms Sohbi had since argued at the time she did not remember being arrested because she suffered dissociative amnesia stemming from personal trauma she had experienced around that time.

A preliminary hearing at the London Central Employment Tribunal today was tasked to determine whether Ms Sobhi knew she had amnesia when she filled out the security form and whether she should have mentioned that on the form.

Ms Sobhi said she wasn't aware when she filled out the form and only had any recollection at all she might have been arrested when she was contacted by a vetting officer in February 2009, about two months after she filled in the security form, to ask why her fingerprints were in the police database.

'For some strange reason... I had a couple of small flashes of memory - nothing else," she said.

'I still did not know of the existence of the dissociative amnesia then. I didn't even know what on earth he was talking about.'

Miss Sobhi also told the hearing that she felt the Met did not support her after she discovered her memory loss.

'I just had a feeling that some sort of assessment need to be done. It is not very nice experience to go through - they refused to provide me with medical assistance.

'Without the help of my family and 
seeking psychiatric assessment I could have spent the rest of my life 
not knowing what was going on with my memory.

'February
26 (2009) was the first time I was aware there was an allegation of 
theft that had resulted in the receipt of a conditional discharge.'

Ms Sobhi said she only had any recollection at all she might have been arrested when she was contacted by a vetting officer in February 2009

She added that she did not know what other memories had been lost because of the 'traumas' she had suffered making her condition 'long-term'.

Not specifying the issues, she said: 'I don't know how many memories are still lost in my mind. They have to be triggered - that is the impairment.

'I have come to accept that I am going to have to live with this for the rest of my life, waiting for the trigger moment, or hopefully not.'

As a result of failing to reveal her conviction for theft, believed to involve stealing £20 worth of makeup from a Brixton department store while she worked there as a cashier in 1991, Miss Sobhi was given a reprimand by the Met.

She says that because she had a justifiable medical reason why she did not reveal her criminal record, she should never have received it.

Miss Sobhi believes that she would never have been sacked if the reprimand was not on her record and should now be wiped off.

Judge Sigsworth expressed his surprise it remained and said that the Met should look into removing it from the record.'She has genuine dissociative amnesia. Clearly it should be removed from the record,' he said.

Charles Sparling, representing Metropolitan Police, said he accepted Ms Sobhi's amnesia was real and she did not know about it at the time.

But citing medical evidence, Mr Sparling argued Ms Sohbi's disability was not long-term and she was not discriminated against because of it.

Once she realised she had amnesia, it was no longer a disability impacting her work, he argued.

However, Ms Sobhi said she had to live with the knowledge that certain triggers could spark repressed memories at any time, which rendered her amnesia an ongoing, long-term disability.

Mr Sigsworth reserved his judgement over the point.

'This is not an easy case,' he said.

How Ms Sobhi's disability is defined will affect up to five separate claims she has made against the Metropolitan Police.

The latest claim came after she was fired following a disciplinary hearing into an £80 littering fine she received for throwing a cigarette butt.

Ms Sobhi said she would never have been sacked if the reprimand was wiped from her record.

She argued because she had a justifiable medical reason why she did not reveal her criminal record, it should have been.

The reprimand still remained on her record, she told the tribunal.

Mr Sigsworth said he thought it should not have remained there.

'She has genuine dissociative amnesia... (so) it clearly should be removed from the record,' he said.

Both parties have been given a week to send Mr Sigsworth submissions over the point in contention.

Ms Sobhi had previously asked for the hearing to be heard in private, arguing her reputation was being damaged by her case being reported by media.

Mr Sigsworth rejected the request.
