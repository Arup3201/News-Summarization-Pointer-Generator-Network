Gary Anderson might have just defeated the best arrow thrower in the sport’s history and landed a £250,000 cheque but he plans to celebrate with nothing more extravagant than a day of home improvements.

‘I’ll be getting some sleep and then I’ll get my tool belt on at home to do some DIY,’ he said, ‘There’s always something that needs doing around the house.’

The heavy hitter from Eyemouth in the Scottish borders came from behind to beat Phil Taylor and become his country’s first world darts champion since Les Wallace 18 years ago.

Lady luck was not on his side as his darts bounced out of the board repeatedly and he was embroiled in a dispute with a member of the crowd. But he regained his composure to clinch the biggest win of his career, beating 16-time champion Taylor 7-6 with a double 12 finish.

‘I’m proud to be a Scotsman,’ said Anderson, ‘I live in Somerset now but it makes it a bit more special to win for my home country. It hasn’t really sunk in yet. Maybe by about Wednesday or Thursday I’ll have realised what I’ve done.’

The atmosphere was electric when Anderson was introduced but it paled in comparison to the wall of noise that greeted Taylor’s arrival on the giant blue Alexandra Palace stage. His signature tune The Power rang out as he applauded his adoring audience. The song by German group Snap! was released just days before Taylor won his first world title 25 years ago. His cheque for that victory was £12,000.

The prince of the Potteries uncharacteristically missed 55 shots at doubles but he believes he can disprove the doubters.

‘I’m going to get better next year and that’s a promise,’ said Taylor, ‘I’ll put things right. I will practise harder than ever.’

Anderson, competing in only his second PDC World Championship final, betrayed no sign of nerves, starting the set with 120 and hitting the bullseye for a 121 finish.

Like all great champions, Taylor raised his performance when on the ropes. A set and two legs down, he held his nerve to win the second set. Celebrating by giving Anderson a playful tickle on the chin was perhaps not befitting such a champion. It was the sort of immature provocation that, in reverse, Taylor has been known to fume over but the Scotsman simply grinned.

Anderson raced to a 3-1 lead but Taylor responded with a masterful display of throwing and nerveless finishing to comfortably take the fifth and sixth set and draw level. The momentum seemed to swing behind the Englishman, who won the seventh set.

Anderson fought back to level at four sets apiece then somehow managed to win a drama-filled ninth set. First he went from 180 to zero in less than a second, knocking out his first two darts with his third. Then came the dispute with a member of the crowd that saw Anderson gesturing angrily towards the individual who was whistling at him as he was on the oche.

‘For a Scotsman playing down in London the crowd have generally been fantastic,’ said Anderson. ‘I couldn’t ask for more but he was ripping into me. I think he got his just reward by being asked to go home early so he missed the rest of the match.’

Anderson composed himself and got back in front. Then, playing on a new board after tournament director Tommy Cox ordered a replacement, he went two sets clear with a 98 checkout. Gesturing towards Rachel, who gave birth to his third son nine months ago, he seemed to signal that he had the win sewn up.

That appeared to spur Taylor into action as the 54-year-old raced to victory in the 11th set. Taylor played the sort of supreme pressure darts which have seen him amass career earnings of more than £6million to take them into a deciding set but even his greatness could not stop Anderson rolling on to lift the trophy
