Two pensioners who lived 120 miles apart were killed in 'senseless' murders by a man they both knew who stole their valuables to sell online, a court has heard. 

Cynthia Beamond, 80, from Halesowen near Birmingham and Philip Silverstone, 67, of Belsize Park, north London, were found dead in their homes just one day apart last year. 

Leo Barnes is accused of murdering the elderly pair and stealing their valuables to sell on Gumtree.

Cynthia Beamond (left) was killed in her home in Birmingham last year. Leo Barnes (right) is accused of her murder and the killing of another man in his north London home the following day

The 33-year-old from Balsall Heath in Birmingham, was described as being 'the only link' between the elderly pair. He denies the murder charges. 

Wolverhampton Crown Court heard how Barnes stole a television from the home of Mrs Beamond, who he had known since childhood through her grandson, before beating her to death and hiding her body in a garage.

He then spent three hours mopping up her blood in the kitchen of her home with a bucket, it was alleged. 

Barnes, a father-of-one, is then said to have rented a car to drive to London, where he allegedly killed former market trader Mr Silverstone on June 28. 

It is understood the defendant once lived in the building where the pensioner was killed with a car jack. 

Prosecutor Stephen Linehan told the court the only connection between the two victims was their acquaintance with the defendant. 

Mrs Beamond's body was found hidden under storage in the garage of her home in Halesown, Birmingham

'This case is about the senseless and brutal murders of two entirely innocent people.

'They didn’t know each other - the only link between them was that at some stage in their lives they had had the misfortune to come into contact with the defendant, Leo Barnes, and he had got to know them and to know where they lived. That is what led to their deaths.' 

Barnes knew Mrs Beamond as a child having been a friend of her grandsons but had lost touch with the widow until Spring 2014, it was heard. 

On June 28, he was seen on CCTV near her Birmingham home and later spotted selling her television at a pawnshop.  

'He had hired a black Volkswagen Golf and was spotted arriving in the area at 10.30am. He parked close to her home at 10.45am,' said Mr Linehan. 

'Mrs Beamond was supposed to meet a friend at 12pm. Being punctual she always called if she was going to be late, so her friend became worried when she never arrived.

'Cynthia had a mobile phone and a land line, but she did not answer either..

'Later her daughter, who always kept in contact, tried to call her and text her as she was going away that day.

Barnes, a father-of-two, was seen in the area on the day of Mrs Beamond's death. He is later said to have been captured on CCTV pawning a television stolen from her house

'When she could not get hold of her she asked her nephews to try. The reason she did not answer her mobile phone is that she had been attacked and killed in her own home.' 

Barnes is then accused of closing the curtains, concealing the pensioner's body in plastic bags and then ransacking the property for valuables to sell. 

CCTV shown in court purports to show the defendant driving to a Cash Generators to sell a television stolen from her house. 

He then allegedly listed the pensioner's car - left sitting in a street where she used to live - on Gumtree to sell for £550. 

The following day, he is said to have bludgeoned Mr Silverstone to death with a car jack.   

The 67-year-old's body was found on June 30. It had been in his home with his dementia-stricken wife for 30 hours by the time a carer arrived at the property. 

When questioned by police, Barnes claims both Mrs Beamond and Mr Silverstone were killed in separate murders, the latter's frail and elderly wife his alleged murderer.

The trial continues.
