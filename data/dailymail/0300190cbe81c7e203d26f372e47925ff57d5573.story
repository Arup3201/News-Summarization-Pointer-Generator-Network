The owner of a remote home in California's rural Tehama County says a bigfoot has moved into the woodland behind his house.

The man, named only as Ken S to protect his identity, says the sasquatch arrived about two weeks ago and has been throwing rocks at him and responding to hunting-style calls.

When Ken called in a team of experts to investigate, they found a footprint and claimed to catch the mysterious 15ft tall creature on an infrared camera.

Evidence: A footprint thought to be that of a bigfoot is seen on Ken's property. To show scale, it is pictured next to the foot of investigator Chuch Schnitizius

Prints: Investigators found several large prints near a creek

Ken said he first noticed something was amiss when two rocks were thrown over his head as he visited a sandy creek on his land, according to ABC 7.

Then piles of wood started to be mysteriously moved around his 200-acre property, sometimes blocking his drive.

Search: Tom Biscardi led the investigation into claims of a bigfoot sighting

With the nearest neighbors more than a mile away and locked gates barring the way to trespassers, Ken, who is in his 60s, said he is sure the strange goings on are not the work of a person.

It was when his brother visited and used a hunter-like call that was responded to, that Ken started to suspect a bigfoot may have moved on to the property.

'He yelped like "whoop, whoop, whoop" and after about five minutes of the whooping there was two or three whoops that came from here,' Ken said as he pointed to the woods behind his home.

'A few days later they took my couch and dropped it and dragged it 20ft towards the house,' he added, referring to a porch swing that had been removed.

Ken, who ditched his Silicon Valley career for a more rural lifestyle in the 1990s, turned to a team of experts dedicated to checking out sasquatch sightings, who visited his property to investigate.

Tom Biscardi, of Searching For Bigfoot, led the investigation and said the sighting may have been down to the mysterious creatures' migratory habits.

'There's the migratory trail that these creatures travel,' Mr Biscardi, from California's Redwood City, said. 'The area that we were at, the gentleman’s land happens to be in the same range of the migratory trail.'

Although he refused to divulge details of the migratory path, Mr Biscardi said Ken's property offered the creatures, who usually travel in packs of between three and eight, shelter and a good food source.

With his team of three, Mr Biscardi recorded a sighting of the bigfoot by luring it into view with a bait of sardines and peanut butter.

'We had seen something large walk up like a man,' Mr Biscardi told the Red Bluff Daily News.

Ruling the sighting out as a bear, he added: 'Bears don't walk more than 15ft on their hind legs unless they're fighting. Plus, they'd be hibernating.'

The crew also managed to record a large footprint found in the sandy creek where Ken had his first encounter.

Mr Biscardi, who is due to appear in 'found footage' style film Pursuit about bigfoot investigators, said about 8,000 of the creatures are estimated to roam the U.S. and said they were only violent if threatened.

Ken added: 'They’re not here to kill anybody I don’t think. He just, I think, wants to claim this portion as his. And [is saying] keep out.'

The property owner said he is willing to leave the bigfoot alone, even if it means no longer visiting the riverbank near his home.

Mr Biscardi and his team, who hope to one day catch a live bigfoot, also plan to return to do a more indepth search of the wooded area.

Not wanting to cause any trouble, Ken plans to leave the bigfeet alone even if it means no longer relaxing on the riverbank near his home.
