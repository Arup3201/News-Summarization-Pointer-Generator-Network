A choirmaster groomed a pupil at a leading private school and raped her while his wife watched, a court heard yesterday.

The teenager was allegedly tied to a bed with a belt before Michael Brewer was told by his wife Hilary to ‘show her what he’d done to her’ during their two-year teacher-pupil affair.

The pair, both 68, are on trial over sex offences dating back more than 30 years.

Trial: Today Michael Brewer appeared at Manchester Crown Square Crown Court charged with rape and six counts of indecent assault following a police investigation along with his wife Hilary Brewer

Peter Cadwallader, prosecuting, told 
the court Brewer was a brilliant and charismatic teacher whose only 
problem was he ‘could not keep his hands off’ the girls at Chetham’s 
School in Manchester.

He allegedly used his office there to initiate sex acts with the pupil, beginning in 1978 when she was 14.

He also indecently assaulted her in a 
camper van he kept parked at school and at his home when she helped 
babysit his daughters, Manchester Crown Court was told.

The alleged abuse culminated when she 
visited the couple at home aged 18 and was told Mrs Brewer knew of the 
affair. Mrs Brewer is said to have told the teenager ‘she had always 
wanted a sexual relationship with a woman’ and that the girl ‘owed her’ 
because of what had happened with her husband.

The girl was taken upstairs and forced
to take part in a sex act by Mrs Brewer, who displayed a ‘great 
thrill’, said Mr Cadwallader.

She was loosely tied to a bed using a 
belt, the jury was told, before Mrs Brewer told her husband to ‘show her
what he’d done’ to her, and the pair had sex.

Brewer went on to target at least two more girls, the court was told, one of which resulted in a sexual affair.

Prestigious: Brewer was director of music at the renowned Chetham's School in Manchester until 1994

Court hearing: The charges relate to the alleged abuse and rape of a teenage girl

The first, a boarder at Chetham’s at 
the same time as the alleged victim, was said to have been propositioned
during a school trip when she was 17.

Brewer pinned her up against the wall 
in a dark corridor and told her ‘You want it really, don’t you?’, Mr 
Cadwallader said. But she told him to ‘**** off’, ducked out of the way 
and ran back to her dormitory, he said.

Around 15 years later, in the 
mid-1990s, Brewer allegedly groomed a 16-year-old, first giving her 
‘platonic’ hugs in his office before moving on to kisses.

Eventually he began helping to take 
off her top and suggesting she perform a sex act on him, the court 
heard. But one evening principal Peter Hullah knocked on Brewer’s door 
and heard ‘scuffling’.Brewer called out ‘Wait a minute’ and, when Mr 
Hullah was allowed in, the girl could be seen exiting by a second door. 
Following an inquiry that year, 1994, Brewer resigned.

The trial was told the original 
alleged victim later told several people of her affair with Brewer but 
never directly complained to police. However three decades on she told a
doctor who did inform detectives, resulting in the now divorced 
couple’s arrest.

The court heard the former pupil – now 48 – had been a hugely gifted musician.

But she was also a disruptive, 
badly-behaved teenager who used alcohol from a young age and had been 
sexually abused by a relative.

Brewer groomed her and the later pupil
through flattery, Mr Cadwallader said, ‘commenting on their figure, 
their dress’ and also ‘their musical talent’.

He would encourage the first girl to 
take part in sex acts in his office, telling her to use a side door 
rather than the main entrance so his secretary didn’t become suspicious,
the jury was told.

Her bad behaviour eventually led to her being suspended, and she was sent to live with the Brewers.

By the time she was 15 he was treating
her as his girlfriend, taking her to pubs and allegedly indecently 
assaulting her beside a canal.

She went to study music abroad when 
she was 16, but on her return to Britain went to visit the Brewers where
the alleged rape took place.

At the time, she didn’t regard what happened as abuse and saw it as ‘a small price to pay for the affection’ he showed her.

‘The prosecution case is very much 
that he abused that position using his power, influence and personality 
to seduce her,’ Mr Cadwallader added.

The alleged victim began her evidence yesterday by describing how her home life was ‘hell’.

She said she thought Brewer was ‘the bee’s knees’, ‘a special teacher’ who needed to be ‘worshipped’ by his pupils.

Brewer, of Selly Oak, Birmingham, denies one count of rape and 13 counts of indecent assault.

His ex-wife, of Rossendale, Lancashire, denies one count of indecent assault and one of aiding and abetting rape.

The trial continues.
