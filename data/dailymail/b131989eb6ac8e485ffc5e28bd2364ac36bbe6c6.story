Mexican troops have replaced policemen in half of a large state that borders Texas, in the deep south, because there were fears that the officers were corrupt and helping the drug cartels.

Some 2,800 heavily armed soldiers were deployed in 22 of Tamaulipas's 43 cities over the weekend - this was done, in part, as President Felipe Calderon moved to defend his drug war strategy.

As the streets of Mexico become increasingly bloodstained, the 48-year-old, who began his fierce crackdown on drug trafficking - which, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, earns up to $48.4 billion a year - in 2006, faces strong criticism from activists.

For decades the Mexican government employed a passive attitude to the cartels, but that changed in December 2006 when the newly appointed Mr Calderon sent 6,500 troops to Michoacan to end the violence there.

The war against drugs has escalated and now there are over 45,000 troops involved, with the president justifying the increase in troops because - as he said last year - the cartels seek 'to replace the government' and 'are trying to impose a monopoly by force of arms, and are even trying to impose their own laws'.

The cost has been heavy, both financially and in terms of life - across Mexico, since Mr Calderon began his crackdown, there have been some 38,000 
drug-related deaths, according to official figures.

On the ground, the men in imposing, heavy black uniform, helmets and armed to the teeth, took to the streets in the state's largest cities, including the capital, Ciudad Victoria, and the border cities of Nuevo Laredo, Reynosa and Matamoros.

Mexico's Ministry of Defence insisted 'the support is of temporary and extraordinary character' but an official in Nuevo Laredo, who wished to remain anonymous, told CNN that local police have been replaced while they are investigated for corruption.

Police on the take are one of the biggest hurdles for Mr Calderon and his soldiers have to eradicate in order to best combat the drug cartels - in the past purges of police departments have been carried out, but the unnamed official said he had 'never seen such a large operation and so many soldiers here'.

According to the Ministry of Defence the local government of Tamaulipas had requested the assistance from the Mexican government.

Troops were moved in to San Fernando, too, where authorities discovered mass graves containing more than 200 corpses earlier this year, while investigating the kidnapping of passengers from a bus.

And last year the bodies of 72 migrants from Central and South America were found at a nearby ranch.

A drug cartel called The Zetas were blamed for the mass graves and for the deaths of the migrants.

In addition, Ciudad Mier - which almost became a ghost town last year following wave of violence followed the assassination of a Gulf cartel leader - will also see troops move in.

The replacement of the police comes only days after Mexican poet and activist Javier Sicilia, leader of the Movement for Peace with Justice and Dignity, discussed scaling down the offensive with Mr Calderon.Mr Sicilia, 56, lost his son in the drug wars and Mr Calderon apologised to the families of the victims of the violence, but defended himself at the meeting.

Later, he took to his Twitter account and wrote: 'They say that everything is the government's fault for sending the army to combat the criminals.

'That premise is wrong. There is not violence because there are federal forces in place. It is the opposite: the federal forces are there because there is violence.

'To reconstruct institutions, we have to purge and strengthen police, prosecutors, judges, in all of the states and at the federal level.'
