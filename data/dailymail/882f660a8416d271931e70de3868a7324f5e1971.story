Irish police spent £200,000 on a world wide appeal for her identity

An Australian woman who triggered a worldwide police appeal for her identity after she was found wandering the streets of Dublin has a previous conviction for deception in her native country, it was claimed today.

Samantha Azzopardi was allegedly given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, last year after she illegally tried to claim social welfare benefit payments, according to the Irish Independent.

The 25-year-old, who is believed to have up to 40 aliases, is currently being cared for by health professionals after she was discovered in a distressed state in the Irish capital a month ago.

She spoke only broken English after being taken into care and communicated by drawing pictures - some of which led detectives to believe she may have been a sex trafficking victim.

This later turned out to be false.

At the High Court this afternoon, where it will be decided what steps to take next with Miss Azzopardi's care, it was heard that her 'life could be at risk' if she was released from the supervision of Ireland's Health Services (HSE).

Mr Justice George Birmingham discharged the order allowing her to be detained under the Mental Health Act.

But he put a stay on the discharge until tomorrow morning so other arrangements could be put in place.

She was due to be assessed by a psychiatrist this afternoon, it was reported by the Irish Independent.

Miss Azzopardi was originally believed to have been a European sex slave aged 14 to 16 because she spoke only broken English after being found in Dublin a month ago.

However, it has now emerged she has family connections in Tipperary, where it is believed she was living with relatives for two months before she was found, and is not a victim of human trafficking. 

A source close to the investigation told the Irish Independent that she had been 'fretful of any engagement with officialdom' after she was found, adding: 'There is no doubt she has been the victim of some traumatic event of some sort.'

Another source told the paper: 'She is very disturbed. 'It would appear there is something very serious going on here.'

The investigation was hindered by her apparent refusal to speak to police and the HSE - her only form of communication being to write short notes in English.

She also drew pictures of being brought to Ireland on a plane and of her lying on a bed with men, leading police to believe she was forced into prostitution.

Identified: Irish police initially feared the girl was a victim of human trafficking but she is in fact a 25-year-old Australian woman who has apparent health problems

It is now thought she may be mentally unwell and had been 'play acting'.

Reports in Australia say a member of the woman's family has now made contact with police in Dublin.

The
 Australian Federal Police are working with their Irish counterparts, 
but have not confirmed reports on her identity, DNA tests or aliases.

The breakthrough in the case, which 
has involved 2,000 man hours and 115 separate lines of inquiry, came 
after police released a picture of the woman which prompted a male 
acquaintance who knows her family in Australia to come forward.

She had refused to be pictured and it is believed the images were taken without her knowledge.

A senior source said: 'We do not 
believe she is a victim of human trafficking. She is Australian and 
appears to be an adult, not a child. She is a vulnerable person and has 
health issues.'

The man who came forward, who is in 
Ireland but not a blood relative of the woman, contacted police 
yesterday following the massive public appeal and identified her.

Mystery: The girl, named Samantha, was found on O'Connell Street in Dublin (above) on October 10

After
 all efforts to identify the teenager failed, police decided to issue an
 international media appeal in a bid to identify her.

Last
 week, the case went to the High Court as police attempted to obtain 
permission to release her photograph in order to try and identify her.

After
 the release of the pictures, there were hundreds of calls from all over
 the world – some coming from frantic parents who believed the girl was 
their missing child.

As
 part of their probe – codenamed Operation Shepherd – 15 possible names 
were provided to investigators. But when these were fully checked, they 
proved to be incorrect.

The 
investigation involved door-to-door inquiries, on-street vehicle and 
pedestrian checkpoints near where the girl was discovered and CCTV 
checks.

Social youth workers and homeless services were also contacted.

The
 investigation team also contacted Interpol, the missing persons bureau,
 the forensic science laboratory, the domestic violence and sexual 
assault unit and national immigration authorities.

Pictures
 of the woman were distributed on the internal Garda computer system, 
and checks were made at ports, airports and train stations.

B&Bs and guesthouses in Dublin city centre were also checked.

After
 it was discovered that the young woman had braces on her teeth, 
paediatric orthodontists around the country were contacted.

However, this also proved a dead-end for investigators as no records of her having got the braces were uncovered.
