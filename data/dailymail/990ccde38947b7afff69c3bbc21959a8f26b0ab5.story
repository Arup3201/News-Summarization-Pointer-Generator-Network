Iceland’s Bardarbunga volcano has been hit by the strongest earthquake since tremors began over a week ago, raising fears that another ash cloud disaster may become reality.

The earthquake reached a magnitude of 5.7, potentially leading Iceland to yet again bring the warning code to red level.

Airlines around the world remain on high alert as the magnitude of the quakes increase, but local geologists say they have yet to see signs of an eruption.

Shaken: Another earthquake has hit Iceland's Bardarbunga volcano, shifting 50million cubic metres of molten rock

The intense seismic activity at 
Iceland's largest volcano system has raised worries that an eruption 
could cause another ash cloud like that from the Eyjafjallajokull 
volcano in 2010 that shut down much of Europe's airspace for six days.

‘There
 was one event during the night, it was a magnitude 5.7 earthquake, the 
largest in this series,’ Palni Erlendsson, a geologist at the Icelandic 
Meteorological Office said.

‘Activity is still deep and we see no signs of anything close to the surface.’

On
 Sunday, Iceland lowered its warning code for possible volcanic 
disruption to the aviation industry to orange from red, the highest 
level on the country's five-point alert system, after concluding that 
seismic activity had not led to a volcanic eruption under the glacier.

Red alert indicates an eruption is imminent or underway with a significant emission of ash likely.

Trembling times: Although the earthquake has not caused an eruption, there are fears of a repeat scenario of the Eyjafjallajokull ash cloud in 2010

Met
 Office scientists believe the earthquakes are a result of magma flowing
 out from under the crater of the volcano, causing a change in pressure.

‘We still can't say whether it will cease, continue like this for a while or erupt. It's impossible to say,’ Erlendsson said.

There
 have been thousands of smaller quakes over the past week at 
Bardarbunga, and areas around the volcano, in the centre of the North 
Atlantic island nation, have been evacuated.

However, before an eruption air travel will not be affected, a spokesman for the UK Civil Aviation Authority said last week.

'The
 (UK) Met Office will be monitoring what's occurring. They will be 
sending out forecasts about the atmosphere and any ash in the air,' he 
said.

'If the eruption does
 occur we will issue what's called a notice to airmen informing them of 
the conditions. It's then up to the airlines with their safety teams and
 experts whether to fly.'
