Jose Mourinho said he hoped new striker Diego Costa would be treated fairly by referees this season after the Spaniard was booked for an alleged dive in Chelsea’s 3-1 win at Burnley in the Barclays Premier League.

Costa scored on his league debut as Mourinho’s team recovered from conceding an early goal to brush Burnley aside at Turf Moor.

But the 25-year-old was cautioned by referee Michael Oliver in the first half even though he appeared to be brought down by Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton.

Mourinho said: ‘It was a penalty. The linesman made a mistake. 

‘We have all explained to him [Costa] what we want and what people in the Premier League like and don’t like. We want it calm with fantastic attitude, competitive but clean and polite.

‘The kid was obviously frustrated to be booked and I hope he doesn’t get any more unfair decisions.

‘I think Oliver had a very good game and unfortunately the linesman didn’t support him well at that situation.’

Chelsea fell behind on Monday night but Costa equalised before man of the match Cesc Fabregas set up goals for Andre Schurrle and Branislav Ivanovic. 

Mourinho added: ‘I agree with Cesc being man of the match. He controlled the game and chose how to play.'

Burnley manager Sean Dyche was not disheartened with his team’s display.

He said: ‘It is a steep learning curve and tonight we have started at the top.’

Mourinho selected Thibaut Courtois in goal, as Saturday’s Sportsmail predicted, but said he hoped Petr Cech would stay and fight for his place.
