On July 13, Andre Schurrle lifted the World Cup. After coming off the bench in the 31st minute, the winger played a crucial part in Germany eventually triumphing over Argentina – setting Mario Gotze up with a pinpoint cross to turn home the extra-time winner.

It was a fitting end to his tournament, which cast him as Joachim Low’s secret weapon. He netted the crucial extra-time opener against Algeria in the second round before rubbing salt in Brazil’s semi-final wound by scoring the final two in Germany’s famous 7-1 win.

When he returned to show off his new medal to his Chelsea team-mates, fans could be forgiven for thinking they were about to be treated to settled-in Schurrle adding lightning pace and finishing to the Blues attack.

What they’ve got instead is Jose Mourinho slamming him after a poor display at League Two Shrewsbury. Schurrle was continually wasteful both in possession and with his frequent long-range shots, with the Chelsea manager admitting his disappointment.

It’s not the first time this season. Handed chances to impress against Bolton in the Capital One Cup and Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League, Schurrle turned in similarly frustrating displays.

Too often he was trying to make the impossible happen rather than using his undoubted quality to influence the game. Instead of Chelsea’s attacking play going through him, he scuppered many of the Blues' moves forward.

The contrast to Willian’s tireless teamwork and ability to play in his fellow attackers makes it easy to see why the Brazilian is preferred in big games.

In the days following the game in Lisbon, Mourinho commented on Schurrle: 'Sometimes phenomenal, sometimes he is so-so. When he is phenomenal, he is phenomenal.'

Mourinho isn’t a fan of inconsistency, and his frustration after the Shrewsbury outing will have been at the German’s inability to react to comments like that – no doubt relayed in far more detail behind closed doors.

This season has also seen the ‘phenomenal’ Schurrle – the World Cup Schurrle – in fits and starts. He looked to have come on to hand Chelsea a vital three points at Manchester City before Frank Lampard famously returned to haunt his old club.

He is currently playing himself into being an impact player – a roll of the dice for 20 minutes when things aren’t going right.

Many a player has made a career out of being a supersub, but it can’t have been the Chelsea niche the 23-year-old had in mind when arriving at the club in the summer of 2013.

Unless Schurrle adjusts his mentality when called upon to be a crucial part of the Blues’ attack, the manager will lose patience altogether.

Last season saw Mourinho cast off a fans’ favourite in Juan Mata because of a perceived inability to follow direction. Schurrle must shape up if he doesn’t want to go the same way.
