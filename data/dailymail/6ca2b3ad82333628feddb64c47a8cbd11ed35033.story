A mother and daughter both lost their lives Monday morning after getting into a car crash while not wearing their seat belts.

Daughter Crystal Rump, 18, was driving a 2000 Pontiac Grand Am around 8:51 am in Williamsburg, Ohio when she lost control of the vehicle in a curve and slid off the road - striking a tree.

Her 42-year-old mother Cindy Rump was in the passenger seat. Both were pronounced dead at the scene. Two dogs were in the vehicle at the time, and died as well.

The Ohio State Highway Patrol is still investigating the crash.

Authorities do not believe alcohol or drugs played a role in the crash.

Pictures of the crash scene show snow covering the ground on the side of the road.

A spokesman for the highway patrol told MailOnline that it wasn't snowing at the time of the crash but the roads were wet with some snow.

According to Accuweather.com the temperature in Williamsburg at 9am was 25 degrees, below freezing.

Police responded to several crashes Monday morning in Clermont County. One man was taken to hospital after crashing his car into a tree earlier in the morning.

'A big thing that we would always push is for drivers to slow down, take the extra time you need, drivers need to slow down a little bit,' the lieutenant of the Batavia branch of the highway patrol told WKRC.

Neither Crystal or Cindy Rump were wearing seat belts at the time of the crash.

Public records show that Cindy was married to a man named Gary Rump.

More loss: Two dogs were in the car at the time of the crash and also died. Police don't believe alcohol or drugs played a role in the wreck. Above, Crystal (left) and Cindy Rump (right)
