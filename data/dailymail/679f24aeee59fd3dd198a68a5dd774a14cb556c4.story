Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson said Ed Miliband should have joined the army

Ed Miliband should have joined the army instead of spending his whole time working in politics - because it would make him seem like less of a ‘geek’, a former Labour Cabinet minister has said.

Alan Johnson said spending three years in the armed forces would have ‘enhanced his reputation’ and made the Labour leader more appealing to the public.

The former home secretary defended Mr Miliband in the face of poll ratings that suggest the public don’t see him as a strong leader.

In an interview with The Times he said: ‘When you have not been prime minister people don’t see you as being prime ministerial, might be part of it.

‘It’s unfashionable to be a geek at the moment.

‘He should perhaps have gone away and gone in the army for three years and enhanced his reputation.’

Mr Johnson’s comments will not be seen as helpful to Mr Miliband, who has struggled to turn around voters’ negative perceptions of him. One poll found four in ten voters regarded Mr Miliband as either ‘very weird’ or ‘somewhat weird’.

Mr Miliband has admitted his problems with presentation, including a major speech in which he admitted he looked less like a Prime Minister than David Cameron.

He also highlighted his resemblance to Wallace from the Wallace and Gromit animated films – but claimed to be a politician of substance rather than one – like Mr Cameron, who was interested in ‘posturing’.

Mr Johnson praised Mr Miliband for holding the Labour party together and preventing it from tearing itself apart after the 2010 general election.

He said it was worrying that the political elite is dominated by people who studied politics at a top university before working as political advisors and then becoming MPs.

He said: ‘All three main political leaders came through that route. It’s fine if 10 per cent of MPs do, but if it is much higher it’s a disproportionate number and that is almost the only way to get into politics now.’

Mr Johnson was appointed shadow chancellor by Mr Miliband in 2010 but resigned in January the following year after it emerged his wife Laura had an affair with a police officer assigned to protect him. The couple have since divorced.

Mr Johnson said he did not want to return to front line politics while Labour was in opposition.

But he said he would consider a return if Labour won the next election.

Labour leader Ed Miliband is not seen as 'Prime Ministerial' because he has not yet been Prime Minister, claimed Mr Johnson

He said: ‘I think they are doing very well without me. [I have] no appetite for being on the front bench, you don’t want anyone there who doesn’t want to be there. I have nothing but admiration for Ed [Miliband] and the way he has dealt with things and his personal kindness to me.

‘It’s nothing to do with Ed at all. It’s to do with me having got whatever ambition there was – there wasn’t a lot in the first place – out of my system.’

Mr Johnson’s comments came as he promoted Please Mr Postman, the second volume of his bestselling memoirs. The first volume described how he grew up in a Notting Hill slum with his siblings after his drunken father walked out and his mother died when he was 13.
