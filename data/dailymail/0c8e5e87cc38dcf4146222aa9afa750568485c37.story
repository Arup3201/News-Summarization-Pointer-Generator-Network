Angel Di Maria is determined to guide Manchester United back into the Champions League, admitting that he misses playing in Europe's grandest competition.

The Argentine superstar helped Real Madrid to European glory this year before moving to United and the Premier League in a £60million deal back in August.

With United absent from the Champions League this season for the first time since 1995-96, Di Maria knows they need to finish in the top four to preserve their status as one of the continent's elite clubs.

'Yes, I do miss Champions League football,' he said in an interview with Sport magazine. 'We will have to do our best this season so that we qualify for next year's tournament.

'It won't be easy. But some weeks ago we were seventh or eighth in the table, and now we are fourth. So we have to keep on working.

'The thing we aim for the most is qualifying for the Champions League, which is what this club deserves. I also want to win titles, but I am aware that we will have to go step-by-step since the manager and some of the players are new.'

It appears Louis van Gaal's methods are slowly taking effect with four consecutive wins carrying United into a Champions League spot ahead of Monday night's trip to Southampton.

Di Maria will miss the match after suffering a small tear in his hamstring in Saturday's 3-0 win over Hull City but this is just a minor setback in a positive start to life at United.

The 26-year-old has scored three times in the Premier League and laid on six assists for others. That is undoubtedly Di Maria's main strength - he has contributed 20 league assists in 2014, more than any other player in Europe's top five leagues.

But Di Maria still feels he can contribute more to the cause as he settles fully into life at United.

'I must adapt to my team-mates because there are still moments in the game in which I feel I am not fully adapted yet,' he said.

Di Maria - who is nicknamed 'noodle' - will have to become used to the physical nature of the Premier League 

'The language barrier has also made it a bit harder, but I am trying to overcome that as soon as possible so I can communicate with everyone.'

Di Maria was given the nickname 'Fideo' - which translates as 'noodle' - by his former Real team-mate Fernando Gago but despite his wiry frame, he is not fazed by the physical nature of English football.

'It's true, the defenders are big and strong here,' he said. 'But I never have any fear. If they have to hit me, then so be it. That's part of the game. I will always try to play my way, no matter how big the defenders are.' 

On living in Manchester, he added: 'It's much colder here and it gets dark a lot earlier than in Spain. I have no problem with the food or anything - there is not much difference between what I had in Spain and what I have here. My only problem is with the cold temperature.'
