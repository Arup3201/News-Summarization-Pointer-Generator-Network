Ronda Rousey is the talk of UFC at the moment and the undefeated women's bantamweight champion is adamant she could beat '100 per cent' of the opposite sex in the same division.

Rousey currently boasts an 11-0 record in the sport having defeated Cat Zingano in just 14 seconds in her most recent contest on February 28.

After her latest triumph, talk turned to how the 28-year-old would fare against a man - a prospect that doesn't faze the 135-pound division champion.

UFC bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey says she'd beat '100 per cent' of males in the same division

'I'm not offended,' Rousey told ESPN's The Dan Patrick Show on Thursday.

'I really don't think that's serious. I consider it a compliment that people will even consider it.

'I never say that I'm incapable of beating anybody, because I don't believe in putting limits on myself,' Rousey said.

'So I mean, I would have to say if you're just talking about what's in the realm of possibility of what's possible of who I could beat, well I could beat 100 per cent of them.

'You can't tell me that there's a zero percent chance that I can beat anyone on the planet, so I'm never gonna say that.'
