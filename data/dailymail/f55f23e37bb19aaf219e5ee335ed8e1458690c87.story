England goalkeeper Joe Hart is expected to be recalled by Manchester City on Sunday for the opening game of their Premier League title defence, but is still waiting for a new contract offer from the champions with less than two years left on his current deal.

City boss Manuel Pellegrini has moved quickly to reassure 27-year-old Hart about his position even though he was left out of last weekend’s Community Shield clash with Arsenal.

After City’s 3-0 defeat at Wembley with Willy Caballero in goal, Pellegrini is leaning towards starting with the tried and tested Hart for their first league match at Newcastle United.

Tough battle: Hart will have to fight off competition from new Man City team-mate Willy Caballero

Hart has been City’s regular goalkeeper in both their Premier League titles in the last three seasons but his longer-term future is less certain.

Although City mentioned the possibility of a new contract offer at the end of last season, nothing has been discussed since, with the club prioritising the signatures of Vincent Kompany, Sergio Aguero and David Silva on long-term teals. Striker Edin Dzeko is expected to follow suit shortly.

Hart’s current contract runs until 2016 and City will have to consider their options before the end of the year as the player’s transfer value will start to decrease the nearer it gets to the end of the term.

He would probably cost around £30million in the current transfer market.

Decision maker: Manuel Pellegrini will decide who will start in goal for Manchester City in their league opener

Hart, who signed for City from Shrewsbury before they were under Abu Dhabi ownership, is happy on and off the pitch in Manchester but will be glad to given the nod by Pellegrini to start the league season.

He joined City’s pre-season tour of the United States late after playing for England at the World Cup but put in an impressive 45-minute performance against Liverpool in Yankee Stadium.

Hart is regarded as one of the most commanding goalkeepers in Europe but Pellegrini decided to sign £6million Caballero from his former club Malaga because he is a fan of the Argentine’s kicking ability.

Caballero is renowned as a good “keeper sweeper” but strayed from his line too often in the defeat against Arsenal.

City probable team: Hart - Sagna, Kompany, Nastasic, Kolarov - Silva, Fernando, Toure, Nasri - Dzeko, Jovetic
