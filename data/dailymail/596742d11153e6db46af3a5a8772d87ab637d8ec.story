A judge has sparked fury after jailing a rapist who attacked three different women for just nine years, claiming the man did not pose a 'serious' risk to future victims.

Despite leaving the women 'terrified and shaken', Marc Partridge did not pose the risk of 'serious harm', Judge Andrew Woolman told Preston Crown Court.

The 28-year-old from Accrington had been found guilty of raping two women and harassing another, with the latter two offences taking place while Partridge was on bail for the first.

The court heard how Partridge, a scaffolder, taunted one woman: 'How does it feel to be locked inside a house with a rapist?' before raping her, muzzling her cries for help. 

At the time he was on bail after being arrested on suspicion of raping another victim.

Months later he harassed a third woman, pouring a cup of boiling tea over her body and slapping her over the face. 

But despite such 'intimidating and bullying behaviour', the aspiring PE teacher was found not to pose a serious enough threat to warrant a longer jail term. 

'In some senses your conduct shows that you may be a dangerous individual but although you are a risk of causing harm you are not at risk of causing serious harm and I trust that after a period in prison those risks will be reduced,' Judge Woolman told the court. 

'You clearly have a real problem in dealing with relationships with women. It may be that you need psychiatric help. 

'The victim personal statements from each of the girls show they were terrified as a result of what you did and are left shaken. It may be that the effect on them does not go.'

The scaffolder raped one woman while on bail for attacking another, taunting her: 'How does it feel to be locked in a house with a rapist?'

One of the man's victims lambasted the sentence as 'a joke'. 

'It is a joke and I do not understand how the judge does not see him as a danger to the public,' the woman said. 

'I think it’s a very light sentence compared to what this man has done. The judge has been extremely lenient. 

According to official sentencing guidelines, rape is punishable by jail terms of between four and 19 years. 

The maximum term a judge can hand down is a life sentence.

Courts must however take into consideration the harm and culpability afforded in each case. 

In the most serious cases where there is extreme harm to the victim and a strong element of culpability on the part of the offender, a starting point of 15 years per offence is advised. 

However where there is found to be no residual harm to the victim and little culpability on the part of the offender, a starting point of five years is advised. 

The minimum sentence for rape is four years. 

'Partridge was smirking and laughing as he went down. I suppose I should be just happy because he is not walking the streets anymore.'

The court had heard how Partridge raped his first victim after threatening: 'If you want me to show you that I'm a man I will show you.' 

He went on to bombard the woman with 1,500 text messages in one month. He was arrested but released on bail, allowing him to lock a second woman inside his home to rape her. 

Neighbours told police the woman's muzzled cries were similar to those 'of an animal in pain' while she was being attacked. 

'He held her down despite her telling him no, he  told her to take the pain,' prosecuting counsel Sarah Johnson said.

'He covered her mouth to muffle her complaints. She submitted. After he acted as if nothing had happened.  

'The woman grabbed the keys to the door in a bid to flee but was pursued and caught by Partridge which was witnessed by a neighbour who saw him pick the victim up and carry her back into his house as she screamed for help.'

Later he launched a campaign of harassment on a third victim, pouring scolding tea over her body, slapping her across the face and throwing her over a table. 

The 28-year-old admitted two charges of rape and one of harassment. He was issued restraining orders banning him from contacting any of the women who brought charges against him.

Jason Leonard appeared in court weeks after being released from prison over child pornography charges

A spokesman for Rape Crisis, said victims' confidence that the legal process will bring offenders to justice is crucial. 

'The criminal justice process can be extremely difficult for survivors of this kind of crime,' Katie Russell, national spokesman for the charity said.

'If levels of reporting are ever going to significantly increase, survivors of sexual violence need to feel confident that engaging with the criminal justice process is going to be worthwhile.'

Last month Judge Woolman complained at not being able to sentence a paedophile for longer under Parliament rules. 

In December he jailed Jason Leonard for eight months for breaking a court order which banned him from accessing the internet.

The 33-year-old had been released from prison weeks earlier after being convicted of child pornography offences. 

'This was a very, very deliberate breach...and if I had the powers, I would undoubtedly have made this sentence consecutive to the current sentence,' Judge Woolman told Burnley Crown Court. 

'But Parliament for reasons best known to itself had abolished the right of judges to return a defendant to custody to serve the balance of a sentence and to impose a term to then be served.'
