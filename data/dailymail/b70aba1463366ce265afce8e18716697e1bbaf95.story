The parents of Ashya King have spoken of their flight across Europe and arrest - and revealed their anger at being branded a threat to their sick son by police.

Brett and Naghmeh King were detained in Spain three weeks ago after an international manhunt, accused of ‘abducting’ their five-year-old son who has a rare form of cancer from an NHS hospital in Southampton.

Speaking exclusively to the Daily Mail, they revealed their anguish at being taken away from Ashya after their arrest at a Malaga hotel on August 30, in Naghmeh’s case for the first time since his birth.

Their son was largely left alone in a Spanish hospital during their three-day detention, howling in despair and confusion at being apart from his family.

Held in grimy adjoining cells at a Spanish police station, Mr King recalled: ‘She [Naghmeh] was crying: “Ashya, where is my Ashya?” On and on and on.

‘She was saying: “Are you happy now? We should have stayed in England — this would never have happened.” Suddenly it was my fault.

‘I said: “Please, if you carry on like this I will have to move cells. My heart is so high in my chest.” I could feel it up here somewhere.’ He thumps his sternum. ‘I said: “Please stop, I can’t take it any more.” She didn’t stop.’

Ordeal: While she was being held in custody, Mrs King would cry 'Ashya, where is my Ashya?'

Arrest: Mr and Mrs King, seen leaving a police station in Malaga for an extradition court hearing, were arrested and thrown into cells in one of Spain’s most notorious prisons for three nights

Mrs King said: ‘I wasn’t crying for myself in prison, I was crying for Ashya. I didn’t want him to be alone in a foreign country not understanding the language. I was just praying the nurses would feel sorry for him, be with him, so he wasn’t completely alone.’

The following morning, their son Danny told them he was being prevented from seeing his little brother.

Mr King said: ‘I knew Danny loved Ashya and wouldn’t leave his bed. But the police chief had given the order. When we saw him I said: “Are we criminals for what we’ve done?”

‘He said: “I have no knowledge of you or your son.” I pleaded with him to let Danny see Ashya. I said: “He’s a sick five-year-boy. He won’t know what’s happening. He’ll be terrified. He’ll think we’ve all abandoned him”.’

According to Mr King, the police chief told him: ‘From what we’ve heard from England, your other son could go in there and cause him harm. He needs protection from you all.’

Diagnosis: Ashya, pictured with his sister Sion around one month before his surgery, was diagnosed with a brain tumour in July after his mother noticed he had problems with his knee and keeping his balance

Brother: Mr and Mrs King' said they had to plead with the police chief to left their son Danny (pictured centre, leaving the Malaga children's hospital) see his little brother

Later that day, the Kings were ‘bundled into a car’, taken to a small town on the outskirts of Malaga to appear before a court before being transferred to Madrid for an extradition hearing.

Ashya’s case sparked widespread public outrage that his parents had been unfairly vilified for seeking the best treatment for their little boy.

Mr King decided to flee with Ashya from Southampton General Hospital in late August when he says he was told, in no uncertain terms, that his son’s cancer didn’t qualify for proton treatment.

If he asked any more questions, he claims Ashya would be taken from his parents — an allegation that Southampton Hospital has denied.

Certain that proton therapy in the Czech Republic would give his son a greater quality of life, he began to make preparations for the trip.

Mr King said: ‘Ashya needed to have the therapy four to six weeks after removal of the tumour for the best chance of survival, so time was running out. We had a buyer for our apartment in Spain, which we were selling to raise funds. I called the estate agent to tell him to sell, quickly.’

'Protection': According to Mr King, the police chief told him: 'From what we've heard from England, your other son could go in there and cause him harm. He needs protection from you all'

Ashya’s welfare remained their primary concern. First, they needed to stock up on the protein shakes his son depended upon so Mr King went online to order two large boxes to pick up in Spain. They also renewed Ashya’s passport and bought a wheelchair.

On August 28, five-and-a-half weeks after Ashya’s surgery they fled to the continent via a ferry.

Fearing for Ashya’s wellbeing, doctors contacted the police, who launched an appeal for information on the King family’s whereabouts. A media storm erupted as they warned that the child needed specialist equipment to keep him alive and that ‘time was running out’.

The hospital also revealed the fact the family are Jehovah’s Witnesses, creating the impression the Kings were religious zealots putting their son’s life at risk.

The first the family knew of the police hunt was when Mr King Skyped his mother, Patricia, at her home in Southsea, Hampshire, from Madrid.

‘She said: “It’s terrible here. The police have been round searching my house. They’re looking for you. This message is probably being taped. You’d better go.”

‘When I told Naghmeh, she just wanted to get back into the car and drive.’

By now in Spain, the family began the 280-mile journey from Madrid to their holiday apartment on the coast.

Mr King said: ‘We knew there was a children’s hospital in Malaga, so we found a hotel called Esperanza, which means hope in Spanish. That was what we needed.’

It was here that their son, Naveed, 20, suggested making a video and posting it on YouTube so the world could see his little brother was safe.

Five minutes after the recording was made, their eldest son Danny, 23, returned to the room. He’d overheard the receptionist on the phone to her boss; they were calling the police. Ten minutes later, two officers arrived and arrested the couple.

‘They said: “Hi, how’s everything?” I said: “Fine, no problem.” I had no idea what lay in store.’

The Kings were to spend the next 72 hours in prison, facing extradition to the UK to face charges under the 1933 Child Cruelty Act. The last they saw of their sick son was through the ambulance window as he lay on his back being driven away.

‘We thought we’d be able to sort this out at the police station,’ says Mr King.

Instead, the Kings were fingerprinted and placed in adjoining tiled cells where they each had a thin plastic mattress and a quilt that stank of urine.

Back in the UK, the story of Ashya’s disappearance had reached fever pitch, with questions being asked over whether his parents had been unfairly demonised.

Accusations: The Kings were detained in Spain three weeks ago after an international manhunt, accused of ‘abducting’ their five-year-old son who has a rare form of cancer 

Desperation: Mr King decided to flee with Ashya from Southampton General Hospital in late August when he says he was told, in no uncertain terms, that his son’s cancer didn’t qualify for proton treatment

The couple were eventually freed by a judge and reunited with their son. He is now in hospital in Prague where he is undergoing pioneering treatment for his cancer.

Last night a hospital spokesman said: ‘Southampton General Hospital has defended its decision to recommend standard radiotherapy and chemotherapy and said its treatment plan for Ashya complied with NHS best practice guidelines.

‘The Trust was concerned for Ashya’s safety because, among other reasons, Ashya was dependent on a tube for food and his -parents are not trained to use it.

‘The Trust contacted the police in line with Trust policy to alert them to the problem.’
