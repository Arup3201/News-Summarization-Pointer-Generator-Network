A professional basketball player might not be feeling very grown up today after he debuted a huge back tattoo only for someone to point out a glaring spelling error.

The word? Mature.

While not on the court, Oklahoma City Thunder’s Kevin Durant has been busy getting a lot of ink done. A masterpiece appears to take up basically the entirety of the 6-foot-9 ballers back.

All grown up? Down at the bottom of this massive tattoo, 24-year-old basketball star Kevin Durant's back now permanently misspells 'mature'

The 24-year-old forward debuted his body art, which features an angel looking down upon a crucified Jesus Christ, on his Instagram feed Tuesday night.

Beside the religious imagery is a bible verse, and it is those words that have Durant, whose contract with the Thunder will pay $85 million, looking juvenile.

‘All done,’ wrote Durant along with his post. ‘James 1:2-4…look it up.’

Unfortunately for Durant, a reader at Deadspin did look it up and found something suspect.

Grounded: The tattoo features an angel with a basketball and Jesus Christ's head, along with the misspelling, which is within a bible verse

But they needn’t have gone through the trouble because no matter where the words come from, ‘mature’ is always spelled the same way.

And Durant’s back has it wrong.

‘Let it do its work,’ the tattoo reads, ‘so you become mautre and well-developed…’

The ‘U’ and the ‘T’ have evidently been transposed.

As embarrassing as this must be for the two-time NBA scoring champion, he’s not the first high-profile, high-earning name to get incorrect ink.

Hayden Panettiere, the young star of ABC’s Nashville, recently opened up in an issue of Glamour Magazine about some words inked onto her back.

Common: Starlet Hayden Panettiere is also in the famous people with misspelled tattoos club, one of the Italian words seen here is incorrectly spelled

The phrase, in Italian, reads ‘Vivere 
senza rimipianti’ or ‘Live without regrets.’ However, there is an extra 
‘i’ and it’s supposed to read ‘rimpianti.’

‘So
I literally have to live by that advice,’ joked the starlet, who said 
she’ll likely get it fixed but isn’t overly concerned for now.

Britney
Spears made a similar mistake when she once got a tattoo of Chinese 
characters on her hip intending it to say ‘mysterious,’ but it actually 
meant ‘strange.’

And heavily inked David Beckham is even in the club. He once got a tattoo that misspelled wife Victoria’s first name.

As mockery of Durant's mishap swelled Wednesday along with the inflamed skin of his back, he apparently rushed to get the mistake fixed.

He updated his Instagram feed around 8pm along with a new picture, writing:

'I got mature spelled the right way lol.'

All better: Durant was mocked across the Web Wednesday and apparently knew it: he updated his Instagram to show he's now fixed the mistake

Permanent: Heavily tattooed David Beckham is in the club, too. He even misspelled wife Victoria's name

Oklahoma City's multi-million dollar baller is looking mighty juvenile, but Hayden Panettiere, David Beckham, and Britney Spears are also in in the incorrectly inked celebrity club
