With their squeaking and their furry coat, the guinea pig is a common pet in many back gardens throughout Britain.

But centuries ago this hairy little creature was a highly exotic creature from South America - and much sought after in aristocratic circles.

Now art experts think they have uncovered one of the first ever portraits of a guinea pig as a pet.

Prized pet: The little-known painting is called 'Three Unknown Elizabethan children' and could well be the first portrait of a guinea pig being cradled in the arms of one of three children

The little-known 16th century oil painting showing the animal being cradled between three children will go on show at a new exhibition later this year.

The portrait, believed to have been painted around 1580 by an unknown artist, shows three young children holding the animal which had recently been introduced into Europe from South America by Spanish merchants.

It will form part of an exhibition, called Elizabeth I And Her People, which opens at the National Portrait Gallery in central London in October.

A gallery spokesman said: 'We know that guinea pigs were introduced into Europe by traders and were kept as exotic pets.

Tasty: The Last Supper by Zapata, in the Cuzco Cathedral shows the platter in front of Jesus holding a very large roasted guinea pig regarded as a delicacy and were highly regarded for their taste

'While archaeological finds for domestic 
guinea pigs in Europe are rare, a partial skeleton of one that dates 
from around 1575 was discovered at Hill Hall in Essex, an Elizabethan 
manor house.'

The youngest child in the painting is also holding a small bird, possibly a goldfinch, which was often used to symbolise Christianity in works of the period.

The inclusion of such exotic animals indicates how Elizabethan England was a period of great exploration around the world.

Food, products, animals and influences from around the world were brought to the country, where a curious public were eager to discover new and exciting things from other countries.

While guinea pig might have been seen as prized pets in Europe, in South America they were highly regarded for their taste.

On show: The exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery (pictured) seeks to show more exotic animal appearances such as an elephant on a crest and an intricate purse made in the shape of a frog

Painter Marcos Zapata (1710 –1773), who was based in the Peruvian city of Cuzco, paid tribute to the highly sought-after animal in his interpretation of the Last Supper, Art In Society said.

Instead of meat or fish, the platter in front of Jesus and his disciples bears a very large roasted guinea pig, in the 1755 painting .

Guinea pigs are native to the South American country and are still regarded as a great culinary delicacy.

They are commonly found on restaurant menus, kept and bred in a similar manner to chickens, and consumed on festive occasions.

The exhibition includes jewellery, costumes and coins from the period as well as paintings.

The
exhibition seeks to show not only the usual staples depicted in 
portraits of horses, stags and dogs; but more exotic animal appearances 
such as an elephant on a crest, a falcon, a ring decorated with a tiny 
depiction of a grasshopper and an intricate purse made in the shape of a
frog.
