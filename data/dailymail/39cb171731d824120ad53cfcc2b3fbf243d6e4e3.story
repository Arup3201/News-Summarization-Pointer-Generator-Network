Accused murderer Gable Tostee has dumped his lawyer in favour of another just before he launches a second bail application attempt.

The 28-year-old has spent the last month in police custody following the death of 26-year-old New Zealand tourist Warriena Wright who he met on dating app Tinder before she plunged to her death from the 14th floor of his Gold Coast apartment's balcony.

Tostee has reportedly dismissed his former lawyer Michael Purcell and instead sought representation from Robertson O'Gorman Solicitors, headed by Terry O'Gorman, the Courier Mail reports.

The legal change comes not long after Mr O'Gorman publicly slammed the released of court documents allegedly detailing phone recordings found by police on Tostee's phone.

Gable Tostee was last month charged with the murder of Warriena Wright after she fell from the balcony of his apartment in Gold Coast, Queensland, on August 8. Tostee has denied the charge

The transcripts, which were filed by Queensland police in the Brisbane Supreme Court in opposition to Mr Tostee's bail application, allegedly detail minute-by-minute conversations between Tostee and Ms Wright inside apartment 1404 just before her death on August 8.

They reveal controversial comments including the moment a male voice was heard saying 'you are lucky I haven't chucked you off my balcony, you goddamn psycho little b****'.

Following the transcripts' publication across a variety of media outlets, Mr O'Gorman expressed his concern over the threat it caused to justice, saying it was 'absolutely worrying'.

'There is a view that access to court documents in respect of matters before the court has the potential to prejudice potential jurors at a later date,' Mr O'Gorman told The Brisbane Times.

'The question, therefore, has to be asked ... where has the affidavit come from?

'Was it supplied to the media by the police?' 

Tostee, who has been in police custody for the past month, recently thanked his friends and family on social media for their support.

He wrote in the Facebook post: 'To my friends and those who have been supporting me, I want to thank you and say that I miss you all.'

'I have been in custody for almost a month now for a crime I did not commit and have lost contact with almost everyone.'

'I maintain my absolute innocence and hope that this nightmare will be over soon.'

An alleged account of Ms Wright's final hours by police claims Tostee held Ms Wright in a 78-second long stranglehold and may have made her drink 'vodka' brewed from a homemade still inside his Surfers Paradise apartment before her death. 

It is alleged the pair were captured on CCTV at 8.45pm meeting outside a surf shop before going to a shop to buy beer. They then allegedly go to Tostee's apartment where they socialise and drink.

Sounds of groaning can be heard, then the male tells the woman she is being too rough during sex, and says 'I don't like being beaten up'.  

According to documents submitted by police to the court, the sounds of a struggle begin at about 2.10am after the sound of drinks being poured had been heard a few minutes earlier.

Over the next few minutes the argument gets worse and at 2.13am the sounds of a struggle are interspersed with his swearing and her saying 'OK, it is all good' while she sounds out of breath.

During the 10 minutes leading up to 2.21am he calls her a 'god damn psycho' twice and there are further sounds of the struggle. 

The transcript allegedly documents Ms Wright's tryst with Tostee, heavy drinking, a violent argument and her fatal fall

'There are sounds of slapping and [Tostee] saying 'let go, let go'. The sounds of restricted breathing coninue for 78 seconds and only stops when there is the sounds of something dropping and then [Tostee] complains about her trying to hit him.

'At this stage the deceased's airway is no longer restricted and she starts yelling out 'no' repeatedly.

'This escalates in crescendo and anxiety and there are sounds of the balcony door being opened, and scuffling consistent with [Tostee] dragging the deceased towards the balcony.'

The Crown continues: 'This part of the struggle' takes just under one minute, commencing 'at 2.19.48am and continues until 2.20.46am, at which point the door can be heard slamming shut leaving the deceased on the balcony and [Tostee] inside the unit.

'The last thing said before the deceased is outside the balcony is her screams intensifying as she screams 'just let me go home'.

'[Tostee] says in a very aggressive tone, 'I would but you have been a bad girl'.

'Her voice becomes more muffled and it is apparent she is on the other side of the door.

'At 2.21.12am, one hour, 24 minutes and 25 seconds into the recording, a scream can be heard that fades, consistent with the deceased falling.' 

A judge on Monday described the charge of murder against Tostee as 'difficult' because the 28-year-old was not on the balcony at the time Ms Wright fell to her death.

Police have claimed Tostee taunted Ms Wright in his flat when she threatened to call the police after discovering her iPhone was missing

Police have opposed the bail application for Tostee, saying he contacted more than 250 girls on Tinder in the months before he allegedly murdered Ms Wright

Tostee had an application for bail with the Supreme Court denied by police, who were concerned he had contacted more than 250 girls on Tinder in the months before he allegedly murdered Ms Wright. 

A document filed in the bail application says: 'police hold a strong belief that if Tostee is granted bail, he will recommence his using social media.'

'Police believe Tostee's blatant disregard for human life and his propensity of violence displayed in this instance would place the safety of the community at an unacceptable risk.'
