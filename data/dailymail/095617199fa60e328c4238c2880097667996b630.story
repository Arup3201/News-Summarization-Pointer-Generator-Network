A schoolteacher who says she could never get a boyfriend because she looked like a MAN spent £40,000 on 22 different plastic surgery operations - and is now dating.

Gina Blacks, of Tottenham, north London, travelled abroad to five different countries for operations including boob jobs, liposuction and tummy tucks and implants to her chin and hair transplants.

The 39-year-old underwent the ops because she was so sick of receiving jibes about her manly appearance she was left feeling like an 'undateable monster'.

Cruel men left Gina Blacks feeling like an undatable monster, but after under-going £40,000 worth of surgery and having 22 operations including boob jobs and liposuction she finally feels good about herself 

Gina had hair restoration in 2009 in Bangkok, she has traveled around the world to have her different operations 

But after eight years of surgery she now feels like a movie star - and is being inundated with attention from hunky blokes.

Now Gina says men can't leave her alone and she is constantly being stopped in the street by bachelors begging for a date.

Gina said: 'Men who were repulsed by me in the past are now stopping me in the streets and begging to take me out.

'I spent my younger years completely alone, wishing I had a boyfriend. Now they're wishing they had me.'

Sick of feeling unattractive, Gina - in 2007, then aged 31 - began ploughing her savings into cosmetic surgery after a lifetime of feeling lonely.

Gina was 31 when she first began ploughing into her savings to fund her plastic surgery - she said the bullying affected her confidence and she felt like she had no friends 

Gina used to be a teacher but she has now left that behind to start her own online store: Gina Blacks' Online Beauty Store 

Gina then left teaching in 2013 to launch Gina Blacks' Online Beauty Store and had her most recent operation in summer last year.

She, who is currently looking for a new man, said: 'The worst period that I lived through was in my adolescents, during school and even at university people would call out rude comments to me.

'It affected my confidence I had no friends. People didn't want to know me or be my friend. I wasn't attractive to people for sexual relationships.

'I thought I looked ugly and manly and I had problems dating, men didn't find me attractive. I had a few flings but I just didn't find myself attractive.'

Gina said she had a few flings before she embarked on her operations but she did not find herself attractive 

Gina says she now feels like a model thanks to her £40,000 make-over but she wouldn't put herself at the levels of Kate Moss and co

But she believes spending eight years in an out of hospitals across England, Tunisia, Pakistan, Cyprus, Belgium, Thailand, has paid off despite having to undergo corrective surgery for botched operations.

She said: 'I wouldn't put myself at the level of Kate Moss, Beyonce or Naomi Campbell but I feel like a model.

'It may have cost me my life savings but it was worth it. I only have one regret, I should have transformed myself sooner.'
