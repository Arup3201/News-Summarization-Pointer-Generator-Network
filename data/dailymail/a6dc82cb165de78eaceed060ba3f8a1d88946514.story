A packed courtroom at the murder trial of a man accused of shooting dead his wife and children were shown horrific crime scene photographs as the first witness took the stand.

Christopher Vaughn, of Oswego, Illinois, 
is charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of his wife and three 
children on June 14, 2007. He allegedly murdered his family so he could move to a remote area of Canada and live alone.

He is accused of parking the van on a 
road near Channahon -  40 miles southwest of Chicago - and shooting his 
wife Kimberly and their children - Abigayle, 12, Cassandra, 11, and 
eight-year-old Blake.

Officer Steve Weiss of the Channahon 
Police Department was in court Monday as the trial began. He described finding the Vaughn family SUV with the bodies as prosecutors 
displayed graphic images.

Paramedic Ryan Jandura told the court
later on Monday that the accused's daughter Abigayle was found still 
clutching a stuffed animal and a copy of Harry Potter.

Vaughn, wearing white shirt and dark pants with a tan jacket, showed little emotion as the images were showed to the court and refused to look at them.

Members of the jury, of eight men and four women, looked visibly upset with one man wiping his eyes.

Vaughn's defense team objected 
several times saying that the images were left on display too long in 
front of the jury.

Attorney George Lenard also tried to prevent happy 
pictures of the family being shown, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

According to the newspaper, Kimberly Vaughn's mother took the stand to describe the moment she knew her daughter and grandchildren had been killed.

Susan Phillips told the courtroom that she saw the family's car on a TV news report and could make out her daughter's body lying in the front seat.

Assistant State's Attorney Debbie Mills said  Vaughn wanted to get rid of his family so that he could move to a remote part of Canada.

She told the jury that he had visited Canada a month before his family were killed to make plans.

The prosecution characterized Vaughn as an 'eccentric dreamer' who spent thousands of dollars at gentlemen's clubs, according to the Chicago Tribune.

Vaughn, 37, was arrested at a funeral home in suburban St Louis hours before a memorial service for his wife and children. He pleaded not guilty and insists the killings were at the hands of his wife.

'It's a case of murder-suicide,' said 
Vaughn's defence attorney, George Lenard. 'Christopher Vaughn is not 
responsible for the deaths.'

The trial is expected to last four to six weeks.

The Vaughn deaths made headlines in 
2007 partly because the family recently had been featured in a Chicago 
Sun-Times real estate article. They had moved from Washington state to the Chicago area and bought a spacious home.

The article was accompanied by a 
photo of the couple sitting at a dining table, their three smiling 
children standing behind them.

After Christopher Vaughn's arrest, prosecutors had vowed to seek the death penalty, which Illinois abolished last year. If convicted, he faces life in prison.

Chuck
Pelkie, a spokesman for the Will County State's Attorney's office, 
declined to discuss specifics of prosecutors' approach to the case 
before trial.

'It's a case that the office is ready and eager to move forward with,' he said. 'It's been a long time.'

Evidence may include a magazine article 
that court records say police found at Vaughn's home about staging crime
scenes and 'making the death appear to be a suicide.'

Court records also revealed that Vaughn 
spent time at a shooting range the night before the deaths and fired at 
targets with a gun that police later found near Kimberly Vaughn in the 
car.

Legal proceedings also revealed that Christopher Vaughn was the beneficiary of his wife's $1million life insurance policy.

In 2009, her family filed a wrongful death suit to keep him from claiming any assets. Among those could testify are an exotic dancer who Vaughn visited days before the killings.

Prosecutors have said that Vaughn had lied to her about his identity and talked of the future.

Vaughn's defence is expected to delve into Kimberly Vaughn's life and health, and likely will include that she was taking an anti-seizure drug at the time of her death that federal health officials have said can increase the risk of suicidal behavior.

Vaughn, a computer security consultant, told police in 2007 that his wife shot him in the leg before killing the children and committing suicide. Vaughn had superficial gunshot wounds to the leg and arm.

Court records show the children were each shot twice and Kimberly Vaughn was shot once under the chin.

According to Christopher Vaughn's account, the family had been headed on a trip and Vaughn said that he had stopped to secure luggage on the roof of the vehicle.

His wife allegedly started shooting shortly after that and he told police he fled the scene to escape.Vaughn has been held without bond in Will County.

His defense lawyer said: 'He's ready for trial, he's been waiting for a long time.'
