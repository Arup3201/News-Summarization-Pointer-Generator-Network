Theresa May last night killed-off plans to bring an immediate end to the scandal of foreign criminals claiming a human right to a ‘family life’ in Britain.

The Home Secretary refused to support a simple nine-word amendment which would have stopped the convicts blocking deportation under article 8 of the Human Rights Act.

The measure, which could have passed within weeks as part of the Crime and Courts Bill, was supported by more than 90 Tories and the ex-Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett.

Backtrack: Theresa May refused to sign an amendment that would have made it impossible for foreign criminals to claim a right to a family life in the UK

They had hoped Mrs May - who has spoken repeatedly in recent weeks of the need to end rampant abuse of human rights law - would seize the opportunity.

But the government refused to support the amendment, which is now likely to run out of Parliamentary time and never be implemented.

Last night, Mrs May said she remained determined to end abuse of article 8, but - because of Britain’s obligations to the European Court of Human Rights - the amendment would have been ruled unlawful.

Backbencher: Tory MP Dominic Raab said that May had missed a real chance to change the law

She promised backbench MPs that, if the Tories win the next election outright, the government will consider leaving the jurisdiction of Strasbourg.

In the meantime, she will introduce a law later this year to make it harder for criminals to claim they have a right to a family life in the UK - though not stop it altogether.

Currently, there are around 4,000 overseas convicts living in the UK which the government want to remove but are blocked from doing so by human rights laws.

MPs backing the amendment said a golden opportunity had been missed to bring an immediate end to this abuse.

They are concerned that - by delaying action - hundreds more people will fall victim to muggings, burglaries and sex attacks by convicts who should already have been booted out.

Securing 100 names for a backbench amendment is highly unusual - and shows the huge strength of feeling at Westminster on the issue.

Tory MP Dominic Raab, a long-term campaigner for reform of human rights law, said the government had lost a ‘real chance’ to remove hundreds of serious criminals each year.

He added: ‘The political promises have been buried in the long grass.’

In a letter to MPs, Mrs May said she was ‘wholly supportive of the intention behind the amendment’, but that it would be ‘counterproductive’.

She said it was ‘highly probable’ that the measure - which would have stopped criminals having any protection under article 8 in most cases - would be declared incompatible with human rights law.

The European Court of Human Rights would then issue a binding interim measure under - under the so-called Rule 39 - preventing deportation until the issue was resolved by Strasbourg.

Supporter: Former Labour Secretary of State for Work and Pensions David Blunkett supported the change in policy

Mrs May said this could drag on for number of years - with the 4,000 criminal deportations that take place each year stuck in limbo.

The Home Secretary added the problems raised by Mr Raab’s ‘quite reasonable proposal is exactly why I believe that we need to address not just the Human Rights Act but our relationship with the European Court of Human Rights.

But she warned: ‘Given the constraints of Coalition, that will have to wait until the general election.’

The Lib Dems have repeatedly blocked any attempt to reform the Human Rights Act or even discuss leaving Strasbourg.
