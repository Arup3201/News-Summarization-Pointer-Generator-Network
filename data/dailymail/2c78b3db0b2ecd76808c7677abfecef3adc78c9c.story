Back in 2006, with her husband accused of taking a bribe from Silvio Berlusconi, Tessa Jowell’s marriage to wealthy tax lawyer David Mills appeared to be heading for the rocks.

The high-flying New Labour couple split up, sold the marital home and went their separate ways.

Yesterday they were back together and Miss Jowell – now Dame Tessa –  beamed with delight as she posed for a happy family photograph outside Buckingham Palace after receiving her honour from Prince Charles.

Honour: Tessa Jowell is made a Dame Commander at Buckingham Palace, and proudly poses with daughter Jess, husband David Mills and son Matthew

It was the couple’s first public appearance since announcing four months ago they were reconciled.

Romance: Matthew Mills and Chelsy

Sharing the proud moment were daughter Jess and son Matthew, 29 – making the news himself over his romance with Prince Harry’s former girlfriend, Chelsy Davy, 27.

Dame Tessa, 65, who played a key role in securing and delivering the London 2012 Olympics, was close to tears.

‘This is so overwhelming, it’s a most extraordinary honour and I feel really humbled by it,’ the Labour MP said.

Mr Mills, 67, was convicted by the Italian courts of accepting £350,000 to provide false testimony for Mr Berlusconi in two corruption trials. He was later cleared on a technicality.
