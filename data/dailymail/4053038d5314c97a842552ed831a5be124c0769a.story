Inside Edition host Deborah Norville says she will be 'stunned and outraged' if New York State authorities do not prosecute the doctors whose actions led to the death of her close friend Joan Rivers.

Deborah, 56, spoke out as Joan's daughter Melissa prepares to sue the clinic where the comic suffered a heart attack that led to her death following a routine endoscopy - and the doctors who treated her.

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Deborah said: 'There are two legal issues, there is Melissa’s civil suit, but I will be stunned and outraged if the State of New York does not instigate criminal proceedings against some of the medical professionals involved. You cannot tell me what has been reported on is not criminal behavior. It shouldn't have happened.'

This Christmas, Joan will be firmly on Deborah's mind. 

'We have an annual Christmas dinner at a famous restaurant in New York and this year we're having a big debate, do we leave one empty seat?', she muses, before firmly deciding: 'I think we do.' 

Joan died aged 81 on September 4 after slipping into a coma while undergoing routine throat surgery at Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic on Manhattan's Upper East Side.

A state report says the clinic and Joan's doctors, believed to be her personal physician, Dr Gwen Korovin, and gastroenterologist Dr Lawrence Cohen, who served as the clinic's medical director,  failed to identify her deteriorating vital signs during the routine procedure.

Dr Korovin was allegedly allowed to operate when she did not have the authority to practice at the clinic, while one of the doctors took a photo of Joan while she was under anesthesia on the operating table, it was reported.

But Deborah chooses to dwell on the positive, including the outpouring of love for Joan following her death - and the massive crowd that flocked to her funeral at Temple Emanu-El in New York City on September 7.

The TV host - who next year will celebrate her 20th anniversary on Inside Edition - gave a bawdy eulogy at Joan's funeral that included tales of how the comedy legend once scattered the ashes of a good friend at Buckingham Palace - and then proceeded to crow about it to Prince Charles. 

Catching herself as she refers to Joan in the present tense ('I still do that', she says), Deborah adds: 'I don't think Joan would have allowed herself to imagine that she was held in such high and wide regard, she knew that people loved her and she loved her fans, but I think she would have been blown away with all the outpouring.

'I remember when we left the synagogue, it was a beautiful sunny day and the Emerald Society police band were marching up and down 5th Avenue and from the police barricade to the wall people were jammed in. 

'I thought 'Oh My God, Joan would love this'.'

Reminiscing about the funeral service, Deborah said: 'I think the rabbi has probably converted to something else by now!

'It started with the gay men's chorus, then Cindy Adams saying the F Word, then Howard Stern saying Joan had a dry vagina, I was worried about my eulogy, but I leaned over and said to my husband 'we're good to go'.

'There was an Irish Catholic band playing, it was totally Joan, totally Joan.' 

Joan nicknamed Deborah and her husband Karl Wellner 'Ken and Barbie'. 

'I never signed my name Deborah, always 'Barbie', Deborah says: 'Joan just made people better, when you were around her you upped your game.

'What a great legacy to leave and what an inspiration for the rest of us. How much better would the world be if each of us lived in a way we hoped would make the people around us better, that's unique.'

And despite the ups and downs that Joan faced during her lifetime, including the death of her beloved husband Edgar Rosenberg and losing her late night Fox show, Deborah said: 'Joan was amazingly resilient. Talk about taking the long view...whatever the story was today, whatever the situation was, however big the poop pile was, she knew if you took the long view, whatever mountains or molehills stood in your way, you'd be ok.

'Kathy Griffin and I had that exact conversation after the funeral. Joan gave excellent advice because she had lived it all. There was nothing she hadn't experienced in the entertainment business.

'She'd had every creepy boss in the world, she had people turn on her, friends turn out not to be friends. She also told me 'at any given time I have 10 balls in the air, if half hit the ground I still have a 50 per cent chance of something happening'. Now what's wrong with that advice!'

In her will, filed in New York this week, Joan left her only child, daughter Melissa, in charge of her estimated $150 million fortune held in a trust, with provisions made for charities close to her heart. 

The will also briefly mentions a potential malpractice lawsuit against Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic.

Asked about Melissa,  Deborah said: ‘Melissa is hanging in there, she’s a young woman, she’s got a career and thankfully she and Joan together had created some really tremendous brands, the red carpet show and Fashion Police. I know she’s out there pitching other programs..

‘She’s a smart woman and she had the best teacher on planet earth, she’ll be fine. You never fill that hole, but she has the satisfaction of knowing her mother saw her turn out well.

‘And the other thing is that she had 40 plus years of guidance and wisdom and memories and laughs and nobody can take that away from her. But she has been robbed of another 20 years - I always thought Joan would make it till 100!'

Tribute: Melissa Rivers spoke publicly for the first time since her mother's death in September at the Hollywood Reporter's Women in Entertainment Breakfast on Wednesday in Los Angeles. She said: 'If my mother were here this morning she would not only be grateful and proud but she would be beyond herself'

Proud: Melissa Rivers and Sarah Silverman on Wednesday. Comic Sarah introduced a video tribute to Joan, saying: 'Anyone who knew Joan knew she only had one true love and that was her daughter Melissa'

Pausing for a moment,Deborah says: ‘The legacy of Joan is she would want people to laugh, she lived for laughter, she could find humor in the most desperate of situations, and I think what she would say to anybody is keep laughing, whatever you do, find a way to laugh.’

'If my mother were here this morning she would not only be grateful and proud but she would be beyond herself.
