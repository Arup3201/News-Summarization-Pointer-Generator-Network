I've had a few requests recently asking me for tips on quick and easy hairstyles, so this week I thought I'd try something new.

When I'm in the mood to update my look, my first port of call is the catwalk shows as they're always a great place to find inspiration for new hair and make-up styles. 

You don't need to go the whole hog and recreate a really extreme 'fashion' look, it's more about discovering a new idea that will give your hair a modern, on-trend feel.

The good news is, there were plenty of very simple updos on the autumn/winter runways, from super-sleek ponytails at Victoria Beckham to ballerina buns at Diane Von Furstenberg. 

My favourite trend, however, was braiding. Plaits popped up everywhere from Marchesa (cornrows) and Chanel (dreadlock braids), to Marc by Marc Jacobs (long, girlish looks). 

So I've taken the plaiting trend and adapted it into a simple yet sexy look I'm calling my Messy Milkmaid Braid.

Jennifer Lawrence and Sienna Miller are huge fans of this casual boho-chic 'do – here's how you can get it.

Step 1 - Prep

You don't want flyaway, super-clean hair when you're doing braids, as they won't stay in place. So start with day-old hair, or massage in a tiny blob of texturizing lotion such as Schwarzkopf Professional Osis+ 4 Play, to give your hair added hold.

Binky says the point of this hairstyle is for it to look relaxed so don't worry if it isn't really neat 

Step 2 - Braid

Now centre-part your hair and split it into two sections – one on either side of the parting. Leave a few long strands hanging free at the front, then loosely plait the two big sections.

Don't worry if your plaits look at little messy as this is a laid-back, boho look that shouldn't be too perfect. Fix each braid with a hair elastic – try to find hairbands that match your hair colour, so they won't show up in your style.

Step 3 - Hold

One at a time, fold each plait up and over your head, then secure in place with Kirby grips.

Feel free to play around with the style once it's in place – you can loosen the braids for a grungier look, or pull more strands of hair out to the front to frame you face.

Finally, fix your new style with a spritz of Bumble and bumble Cityswept Finish Spray.

If you're feeling particularly adventurous, you could even accentuate your braids with some coloured hair chalk such as Bumble and Bumble Spray Chalk for a fun, festival-style feel.

Simple, sweet and sexy with a fashion-savvy spin –that's what call I a clever 'do.
