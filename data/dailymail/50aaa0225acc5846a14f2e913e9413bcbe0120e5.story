Fraudsters who could have made up to £4 million from job seekers after posting fake adverts for work at Harrods online were jailed today.

The gang, described as ‘manipulative, arrogant and devious’, wrote ‘Trojan’ malware and hid it in job application packs to download from free website Gumtree.

Once embedded on to applicants’ computers, the illicit software copied bank log-in and security details and sent them to the gang.

They would then empty the victims’ accounts, earning between £400 and £4,700 each time.

The fraudsters would then send 'mules' to withdraw the money from banks or would themselves go on online shopping sprees.

It was described as a ‘deliberate, organised, planned and sophisticated crime’.

One of the gang members, Olalekan Awosile, 27, set up an account in Costa Rica to launder their ill-gotten gains.

Within just a 21-day period detectives found BlackBerry messages indicating the gang were making on average £16,000 a day.

Calculated over the whole length of the nine-month fraud, they could have netted as much as £4 million, the Old Bailey heard.

Walton Hornsby, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey it was difficult to estimate but said they had pocketed at least £1 million.

The jury at the Old Bailey were told the gang, based in South London, could have made up to £4 million

The fraud was uncovered when 
job seekers complained to Harrods that their computers had become 
infected when they downloaded the application form.

The
store’s director of security Gregory Faulkener then responded to an 
advert, downloaded and quarantined the application pack and called in 
American ‘phishing’ experts.

Finding
the malware, he contacted Scotland Yard’s economic crime unit 
while sending an email warning the gang to stop using Harrods name. In 
total the gang placed 422 bogus job adverts for Harrods alone.

Undeterred,
the gang continued to post more than 400 further fake job adverts for 
other jobs such as a £25,000 sales assistant at a storage firm.

Tracing the unique IP addresses used to post the jobs on Gumtree, police raided homes connected to the gang more than nine months after the first fake job adverts were posted in late August 2010.

The whole gang were rounded up in 2012 and detectives found 108 identities that had been stolen, but fear the gang hacked many more.

After showing an interest in the advert, the Old Bailey heard victims were sent an email pretending to be from the respected Blue Arrow recruitment
agency inviting them 'to fill in that application pack for further 
consideration'.

Once embedded, the software waited until the user tried to access their online bank accounts.

The
unsuspecting user would then be redirected to fake sites 'which looked 
all the world that it was a genuine bank site they were trying to 
contact' before the gang’s software stole log on details.

Most of the fraudsters were originally from Nigeria and living in South London. They were all studying, or had studied, IT.

Today, British Tyrone Ellis, 27, his former classmate Awosile, Southampton Solent University graduate Ajibola Akinlabi, 26, Damilare Oduwole, 26, and Ademola Araoye, 29, were jailed for conspiracy to defraud.

Jailing them for a total of more than 27 years, Judge Stephen Kramer QC said: 'Computer fraud is relatively easy for people like you who have the requisite knowledge to defraud people of their hard earned savings and money.

'In this case it was particularly mean those out of work and looking for jobs and thought they were on the way to obtaining jobs with reputable employers and in reality they were being defrauded.

'The fraud agreed could not have been carried out without each of you playing your parts.

'Creating the malware, using it to obtain bank details, placing bogus job adverts and seeing that cash stolen from members of the public whose accounts had been compromised.'

Ellis
was jailed for four-and-a-half years; Awosile, Akinlabi, and Oduwole 
were jailed for seven years each; and Araoye, who pleaded guilty before 
trial, was given two years.

Awosile and his ex-girlfriend Nadine Windley, 26, who worked as a Santander cashier and passed on bank details of account holders who had £9,800 stolen from them, were also jailed for fraud by abuse of position.

However, Windley was given a 12-month jail sentence, suspended for two years, and was ordered to carry out 150 hours of community service and a year’s supervision order.
