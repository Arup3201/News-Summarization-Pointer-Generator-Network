Neanderthals had the ability to speak like modern humans, according to a new study.

In the last 20 years, some scientists have come to believe that Neanderthals had the ability to communicate with each other using speech, and new analysis of a fossilised hyoid bone has added weight to their claims.

The horseshoe-shaped bone in the neck looks like a modern human’s and now computer modelling has revealed that it was probably used in a similar way.

The hyoid bone supports the root of the tongue and enables humans to speak.

Researchers believe the way the bone worked is ‘highly suggestive’ of complex speech in Neanderthals.

Writing in journal PLOS ONE, a team of scientists said: ‘Neanderthal and modern human hyoids also present very similar internal architectures and micro-biomechanical behaviours’.

The researchers used 3D X-ray imaging and mechanical modelling to analyse the throat bone and work out how it behaved in relation to the surrounding bones in Neanderthals.

‘We would argue that this is a very significant step forward. It shows that the Kebara 2 hyoid doesn't just look like those of modern humans - it was used in a very similar way, said Stephen Wroe, from the University of New England in Armidale, New South Wales, Australia.

‘Many would argue that our capacity for speech and language is among the most fundamental of characteristics that make us human. If Neanderthals also had language then they were truly human, too,’ he told BBC News.

Before the discovery of a Neanderthal hyoid bone in 1989, it was thought that only modern humans were capable of complex speech, which evolved around 100,000 years ago.

Many would argue that our capacity for speech and language is among the most fundamental of characteristics that make us human. If Neanderthals (illustrated) also had language then they were truly human, too,' Professor Wroe said

The hyoid bone is also known as the lingual bone.

It is a horseshoe-shaped bone situated in the front of the neck between the chin and the thyroid cartilage.

Unlike other bones, the hyoid is only distantly articulated to other bones by muscles or ligaments.

It aids in tongue movement and swallowing and provides attachment to the muscles of the floor of the mouth and the tongue above, the voice box below, and the epiglottis (the flap that sits at the base of the tongue, which keeps food from going into the windpipe) and pharynx (which keeps food and liquids out of the lungs) behind.

The discovery of a modern-looking hyoid bone of a Neanderthal man in the Kebara Cave in Israel led its discoverers to argue that the Neanderthals had a descended larynx, and thus human-like speech capabilities.

The hyoid bone was discovered in Kebara Cave in Israel and is similar to the same bone found in modern humans.

Professor
 Wroe said bones up to 500,000 years old, which were found in Spain and 
are thought to belong to Homo heidelbergensis - a relative of modern 
humans - could show that the origins of speech are even older than 
thought.

While he admitted that the research, which used computer modelling to investigate whether Neanderthals could speak, should not be accepted a proof, he said: ‘I do think it will help to convince a good number of specialists and tip the weight of opinion.’

A study by the Max Plank institute published earlier this year suggested that the last common ancestor we shared with the Neanderthals around half a million years ago, shared speech and language with modern humans.

Dutch researchers believe that the origins of our modern language are ten times older than previously thought and are interested in the implications for understanding present day linguistic diversity.

Psycholinguistics researchers Dan Dediuand and Stephen C. Levinson, said that far from being slow brutes, Neanderthals’ cognitive capacities and culture were comparable to ours.

The duo, who have looked at past findings in detail, argue that essentially modern language and speech are an ancient feature of our lineage dating back at least to the most recent ancestor we shared with the Neanderthals and the Denisovans (another form of humanity known mostly from their genome).

Professor Dediuand said he thinks the news study supports the idea that speech and language is an ancient feature reaching back at least to the last common ancestor we shared with Neanderthals.
