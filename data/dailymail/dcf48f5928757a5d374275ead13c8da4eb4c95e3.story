Students in Pakistan are undergoing training to prepare them for potential terrorist attacks in the wake of the deadly Taliban strike on an Army School in Peshawar last year.

School children and teachers have been visited by police and bomb disposal squads, practicing how to handle firearms, defuse explosives and provide emergency care.

The new government directives follows the December 16 tragedy, which saw a group of   terrorists stormed the  Public Army School in Peshawar, killing 145 people, including 132 schoolchildren.

Students in Multan, Punjab, underwent emergency training which saw a bomb disposal squad instruct classes of girls how to locate and defuse an explosive device.

The mock drill also trained the schoolgirls how to give assistance to 'injured' people and how to safely evacuate the school. 

'We have received training and now we will utilise this if the need arises,' a female student at Multan Public School told Dawn.com.

In Sindh province, teachers and students at the Mama Parsi school were trained by police at a centre in Karachi.

Provincial police demonstrated self defence and gave the students weapons training.

'This is our expertise in counter-terrorism,' Sindh Police's Maqsood Memon told Dawn.com.

'We are doing for the government but we thought it should be given to civil society in case of an emergency — they should know what to do if the need arises,' he said, adding that it is a public service campaign free of charge.'

This is just the latest step in a nationwide campaign to prepare students and school staff against potential attacks in the wake of the December tragedy.

In Peshawar, where the attack took place, female teachers are receiving combat training to 'engage' terrorists, with the first group finishing training last month. 

Officials in Peshawar, capital of Khyber Pakthunkhwa province, said the move would allow teachers to fight off terrorists 'for [an] initial five to 10 minutes' before back-up arrives. 

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa information minister Mushtaq Ahmad Ghani has said the training would allow school staff members to 'engage' attackers for five to ten minutes before law enforcement personnel could respond.

He told reporters on January 13: 'The provincial cabinet has decided to allow teachers and other staff members to keep their licensed weapons with them so that in case of any eventuality they could engage attackers for initial five to 10 minutes before personnel of law-enforcement agencies will show up to respond to the attack.'

The 35,000 educational institutions - including schools, colleges and universities - across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been ordered to beef up security following the brutal attack on the Army Public School.

Mr Ghani also announced earlier this month that authorities would build walls at least 8ft high around government-run education institutions, and would also introduce community policing systems whereby civilians with experience operating weapons would be trained and paid to guard educational facilities.

Private sector schools, colleges and universities have meanwhile been issued with strict guidelines with requirements including having guards, Mr Ghani said, adding that schools' licenses could be revoked if they did not follow the rules.

In response to the Taliban attack, Pakistan's parliament last week passed a constitutional amendment approving the establishment of military courts to hear terrorism-related cases.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif also lifted the country's six-year-old moratorium on the use of the death penalty, reinstating it for terror cases in the wake of the slaughter at the school.

However, critics have warned the move to arm teachers could put children at even greater risk, as well as affect teachers' performance at work.
