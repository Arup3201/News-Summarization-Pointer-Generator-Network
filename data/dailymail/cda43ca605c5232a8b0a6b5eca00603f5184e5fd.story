There are fears that there is an inadequate food supply for bees as their numbers double with the popularity of urban beekeeping.

With the growing trend of producing home-grown honey, the number of bees in London has doubled in the past four years.

Now beekeeping associations are warning that there may not be enough food to sustain the growing numbers or whether hobby beekeepers have the knowledge to look after the insects.

Beekeeping trend: As popularity of urban beekeeping grows, so do the bee population fuelling fears that there is not enough food to sustain the insects

The London Beekeepers Association (LBKA) says some 39 per cent of beekeepers have had no training.

The National Bee Unit estimates that there are 3,200 colonies in the Greater London area as of May this year.

A hive requires as much as 66lb of pollen and 260lb of nectar to be sustaining and experts worry that London does not have enough of the plants that are nectar-rich and bee-friendly.

Without the necessary food, bees get sick as disease passes through the hive, infecting all the insects.

Angela Woods, the secretary of the LBKA, told The Daily Telegraph that the association encouraged beekeeping with adequate training.

She said: ‘We are not saying there are too many bees now but the big worry is that in a few years there could be too many.

‘The other question is how much food is enough?

‘We need to make sure that planting for them keeps pace with that growth.

‘A good analogy is it’s like having a cat in the room with one bowl of food, and you think “that’s lovely”, and then you put two cats in the room and realise that one’s going to hungry.’

Bees feed on nectar as their primary energy source and pollen for protein and other nutrients.

To buy five combs, bees, brood at all stages, a laying marked queen, and stores cost between £140 to £240.
