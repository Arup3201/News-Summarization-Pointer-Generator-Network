When illness forced vets to remove Great Dane Lily’s eyes, the prospects of a fulfilling life didn’t look good.

But then no one had reckoned on her pal Maddison stepping in to turn guide dog.

The pair have been inseparable for years but now find themselves looking for a new home because their owner could no longer cope.

The catch for anyone interested is that the Great Danes come as a package. They have been waiting at the Dogs Trust re-homing centre in Shrewsbury since July.

Manager Louise Campbell said: 
‘Maddison is Lily’s guide dog. If they are out and about, for the 
majority of the time Maddison will lead and Lily will walk nearly 
touching her so she knows where to go. It’s lovely to watch. Maddison is
 always looking out for her.’

Lily, six, was barely a puppy when 
she was struck down by a condition that caused her eyelashes to grown 
into her eyeballs, damaging them beyond repair.

It was after this traumatic event that her relationship with seven-year-old Maddison developed as she took her under her wing.

The best buddies lived together until their owners decided they couldn't look after them any more.

Miss Campbell said: 'With her lack of
 sight, Lily's other senses have heightened so although we don't split 
them up often she can tell if Maddison is nearby.

'They curl up together to go to sleep and they are very vocal with each other.

'We haven't analysed their different 
barks but if Lily wants to go forward and Maddison is in her way, the 
bark will have a different pitch.

'They are very close to one another and enjoy each other's company'.

Miss Campbell said that Lily does all
 the things normal dogs do and if you saw her from a distance you 
wouldn't realise she had anything wrong with her eyes.

She added: 'They are really happy with life, the glass is always half full with these two.

'They have been with us for a 
considerable amount of time but they are quite happy and go about their 
daily routine - they are very affectionate.'

She believes the dogs' size and 
advancing years, as well as the fact they have to come in a pair, may 
have put off potential owners and she warned that anyone contemplating 
taking the dogs in should look at their lifestyle and think of the 
responsibility involved.

'They are not gigantic when you see 
them outside. These are two lovely big girls who deserve to live out the
 rest of their lives together in comfort', she said.

Dogs Trust cares for around 16,000 stray and abandoned dogs every year through a network of 17 re-homing centres.

The Great Dane is seeking an owner who would be willing to give both her and best friend Maddison a new home
