Dutch designer Dave Hakkens developed Phonebloks, pictured, so different features such as the camera or storage can be replaced easily

Rather than spending hundreds of pounds on a new handset each year, what if you could simply keep your phone but upgrade the camera, replace the display, increase storage and more in just one click? That's the idea behind Phonebloks.

Created by Dutch designer Dave Hakkens,  Phonebloks is a customisable smartphone made up of what's called 'modular elements', or blocks, that can be instantly swapped and replaced. 

If a battery dies, for example, a new one can be clipped into place.

Storage can be upgraded or cameras with different lenses an be swapped in and out depending on the occasion.

Hakkens designed the concept phone as a more environmentally friendly way of recycling smartphones, to prevent the trend of customers replacing handsets on a yearly basis.

He said: 'Every year millions of mobile phones are thrown away because they are 
broken or obsolete.

'In most of these cases it is just one part that 
needs repairing or upgrading and all the other parts work fine.'

The Phoneblok handset is made of separate components that can be ‘clicked’ together.

Every component has its own function and they include a Bluetooth and Wi-Fi transmitter, a battery, 
camera, new display and storage.

When one of the components breaks, or needs upgrading, it can be 
replaced with a new one.

The components are called bloks, and they each attach to a universal base that contains all the relevant electric connections. They are fixed onto this board using pins, with two screws holding everything in place. Individual bloks are sold through the Blokstore - similar to an app store, but for hardware

Phonebloks is a concept at the moment while Hakkens seeks support from hardware partners and potential customers

Hakkens claims: 'Choosing 
separate components enables you to personalise your mobile phone to your
 needs.

'Are you into taking photos? Go for the best camera. Are you 
working in the ‘cloud’? Choose less storage. No need for a specific 
function? Go back to basic and choose a top notch battery.'

After a customer buys the Phoneblok base, individual bloks are sold through the Blokstore - similar to an app store, but for hardware. 

Although Hakkens admits that Phonebloks wouldn't solve the problem of electronic waste and pollution, because the bloks would still need to be thrown away, it is a more cost-effective and environmentally-friendly alternative. 

Phonebloks isn't available to buy yet, and Hakkens claims that the concept will only be sold if there is a significant interest from customers, as well as hardware partners.

Even the display on the Phoneblok handset, pictured, can be replaced. Hakkens designed the concept phone as a more environmentally friendly way of recycling smartphones, to prevent the current trend of replacing handsets almost yearly
