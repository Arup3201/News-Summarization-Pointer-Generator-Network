Convicted murderer Samuel McKinley, 53, is on-the-run from Maghaberry Prison, Northern Ireland

A manhunt was underway today after a murderer went on the run - just four days after his two sons were also jailed for life for killing a newsagent.

Convicted murderer Samuel McKinley, 53, vanished from prison where he was serving a life sentence after being jailed in 1996.

His disappearance comes just days after his sons Samuel, 25, and Jon, 23, were jailed for life at Winchester Crown Court.

The pair were told they must serve at least 28 years for killing newsagent Choudhry Zishan, 35, who was beaten to death while on his way to work in Eastleigh, Hants.

Hampshire police today said they had been notified of McKinley's escape as he lived in the area before being jailed.

Inquiries are under way in the county while officers are liaising with counterparts in Northern Ireland where McKinley Senior was serving his sentence at Maghaberry Prison.

He was out on a pre-release work scheme when he fled.

McKinley senior lived in Southampton, Hants, when he was jailed for life in 1996 for stabbing to death a man at a flat in the city.

A spokesman for the Northern Ireland Department of Justice said: 'Samuel McKinley was due to return to Maghaberry Prison by 4pm on Monday December 22 but failed to return.

'He has not been recaptured yet and is still unlawfully at large.'

McKinley senior was tried at Winchester Crown Court for stabbing to death Robin Stoddart.

He attacked drinking companion Mr Stoddart, 40, after a two-day binge in January 1996. Mr Stoddart bled to death after an artery in his thigh was severed.

McKinley senior told the court that he was so drunk he could not remember what had happened.

His son Jon used the same defence when he and his brother, Sam, were put on trial for murder, also at Winchester Crown Court.  

A statement from Hampshire police today said: 'We are in touch with colleagues at the Police Service for Northern Ireland.

'We will continue to monitor this and there are a lot of enquiries in hand.

'We do not have any information to suggest this is linked to the recent conviction of McKinley's sons.

'We have taken measures to ensure appropriate people are made aware.

'Out of respect to those individuals, we will not be disclosing who they are.'

McKinley senior is reported to have absconded twice before.

A court in 2012 heard McKinley was assessed as dangerous and at a high risk of reoffending, but he had achieved 'enhanced prisoner status' in jail and was engaging in various probation-run courses.

McKinley is described as having a fresh complexion, of heavy build, with blue eyes, black hair and is about 5ft 10ins.
