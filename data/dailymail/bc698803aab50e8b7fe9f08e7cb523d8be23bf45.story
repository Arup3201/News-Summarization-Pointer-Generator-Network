Professional polo player Nic Roldan has revealed his plans to try and change society's view of his sport, which he admits many see as elitist, expensive and overly flashy.

In an interview with luxury menswear website Mr Porter, the 31-year-old, who is ranked the number one polo player in the US, explained that polo is not just about wealthy athletes enjoying a glamorous lifestyle - and insisted that the sport can be pursued by almost anyone.

'A lot of people think of polo as a lifestyle and not an actual sport,' he said. '[I'm on a mission to] bring the masses towards the sport.

It's not just about horses and divorces: Nic insists that there is more to the sport than glamour and luxury

Hard working: The 31-year-old looks after 30 polo ponies and travels for half of the year

'...Who knows if polo will get to the magnitude of tennis or golf – but I think it has the potential to grow.' 

But while he is eager to help alter the public perception of the sport, Nic does admit that he has indulged in the more lavish aspects of the polo lifestyle. 

Having been rocketed to sporting stardom at age 15, when he became the youngest ever player to win the US Open Polo Championship, the sporting legend quickly allowed himself to become caught up in a world of jet-set luxury and excitement. 

'I arrive [at a tournement] and I have a car, an apartment on the ocean, no parental guidance,' he said of his teen years spent on the international polo circuit. 'I think, "Wow, this is fun. I can keep doing this."'

Social butterfly: Nic ensures he puts in as much effort socializing with the other players and team owners as he does focusing on the game itself

Nowadays, Nic tends to live a slightly more low-key lifestyle, focusing on his playing schedule, his strict training regime - and, most importantly, caring for his 30 polo ponies.

The part-time model, who has starred in numerous campaigns for Ralph Lauren's Black Label and is represented by New York-based agency Wilhelmina Models, spends half of the year traveling to matches.

During that time, Nic ensures he puts in as much effort socializing with the other players and team owners - which he sees as a 'vital' aspect of polo - as he does focusing on the game itself. 

'The owners do it because they love the sport, and horses, but they also love what it brings – the dinners and cocktail parties,' he explained. 

'So as an athlete, you have to be very sociable. I love it. It’s always come naturally for me.'

Aiming for the top: Nic’s ambition is to reach 10-goal status and win the Argentine Open

And while NIc has now spent more than half his life on the professional polo circuit, he is in no rush to give up the sport any time soon - and, in fact, is hoping to achieve much more within the sport before he even considers retiring. 

The New York-based athlete is one of only five players in the world to hold an eight-goal handicap in the sport, and he is only the third American in history to have achieved that status. But while his past achievements are impressive, Nic is working towards become one of the few players to ever achieve a 10-goal handicap. 

'Nic’s ambition is to reach 10-goal status, win the Argentine Open, claim a second U.S. Open Polo Championship victory and propel popularity for the sport,' his website states.
