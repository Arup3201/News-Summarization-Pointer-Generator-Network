I nearly fell off my chair when Foxy Bingo invited me to the launch of their Bingo Speed Dating concept – where I’d get to date eight gorgeous celebrity men in just one evening.

I Google searched each name straight away to check them out. While I was excited to meet gorgeous Romeo Dunn, Waterloo Road’s Lucien Laviscount, TOWIE‘s Charlie King and James ‘Arg’ Argent, it was hunky canoeist Richard Hounslow who caught my eye, as well as Made in Chelsea new boy Sam Cussins, cute 400m athlete Jack Green and Geordie Shore’s bit of rough Gary ‘Gaz’ Beadle.

The dates would take the shape of three minute chats with each man, and I would date all eight across the evening. It was a hard job, but someone had to do it... 

The eligible bachelors: The boys of TOWIE, Made In Chelsea and Team GB lined up with Foxy and prepared for their speed dating

Here come the girls: Deni posed with Foxy and her fellow speed daters

FIRST DATE: Jack Green

Confident and intense, as soon as I sat down he hit me with the line ‘You were the first girl I noticed in this room’. After that, Jack jumped from third to top place. At the end of our three minutes he asked me to be sure I was around after. Wahey! After dating though, he spent a lot of time chatting to other girls. I didn’t feel like hanging around for too long and, once we eventually got talking, the spark had fizzled slightly.

SCORE: 5/10 Hot, but the air-con’s a bit nippy

BEST FEATURE: Good initial demeanor and eye contact

CONVERSATION: How Jack just turned 21, got fourth place in the Olympics and has just bought his second house.

FIRST IMPRESSION: Charmer.

LASTING IMPRESSION? Bit young. He says he likes a girl to be hard work. In reality, he probably needs someone who likes being led around.

WOULD YOU MEET AGAIN? Maybe as friends.

Going in for the kill: Jack wasted no time in pulling out the chat-up lines

  ................................................................................................................................................Second date: Sam Cussins

Charming and handsome. What more could you want?
With the same refined accent as the rest of the Chelsea crew, he 
presented himself impeccably. He clutched his drink a little tightly, 
though. Was he waiting to get somewhere? A good sport, he stayed for a 
few bevvies after. Banter.

SCORE: 8.5/10 Hot stuff

BEST FEATURE: Nice hair and dress sense.

CONVERSATION: His job outside the TV show and the fickle notion of fame.

FIRST IMPRESSION: Posh boy.

LASTING IMPRESSION? Cool guy.

WOULD YOU MEET AGAIN? Yes.

Maid in Chelsea: Deni was impressed by Sam Cussins' posh boy behaviour

  .....................................................................................................................................................................................................Third date: Richard Hounslow 

I didn’t know quite what to expect from this accomplished hunk of a man. What I got was a down-to-earth, cheeky Essex chappy with fame as far away from his head as possible. He let people take pictures with his winning silver medal but he didn’t flash it around. This was a guy I didn’t feel inferior to. Which is funny, because he impressed me most.

SCORE: 9/10 Red hot

BEST FEATURE: Sense of humour.

CONVERSATION:  You know when you have a chat with someone you really fancy and you don’t remember any of it? That’s what happened.

FIRST IMPRESSION: Lovely eyes.

LASTING IMPRESSION? He’s great company.

WOULD YOU MEET AGAIN? Yes.

Going for gold: Deni gave Richard a whopping 9/10

    .....................................................................................................................................................................................................

Fourth date: Lucien Laviscount

Smooth operator Lucien was appropriately tactile and a gentleman. With a kiss on each cheek and a naughty smile, had I fancied him (and he is very fanciable, girls) I may have fainted.

SCORE: 6.5/10 Warm by the fire

BEST FEATURE: Not afraid to charm the pants off a girl, and those pearly whites.

CONVERSATION: The perfect date, what he’s looking for in a girl, and he asked a lot about me, too.

FIRST IMPRESSION: Baby face.

LASTING IMPRESSION? He’ll treat you like a princess.

WOULD YOU MEET AGAIN?  As friends.

Million dollar smile: Deni was impressed by Lucien's pearly whites

   ..............................................................................................................................................................................................

Fifth date: James ‘Arg’ Argent

This TOWIE star gets his fair share of grief for being the butt of the joke among his friends on the hit show – it can’t be helping his luck with the ladies or first impressions. Having said he just wants to meet a ‘nice, well-spoken girl’ who likes musical theatre, I hope he does as he was very sweet on our ‘date’.

SCORE: 3/10 Cool beans

BEST FEATURE: Good manners.

CONVERSATION: A good balance of each others hobbies and interests – which were not dissimilar. That signature Arg giggle crept its way in a couple of times.

FIRST IMPRESSION: I don’t fancy him.

LASTING IMPRESSION? He’s more attractive after having met him, but still not my type.

WOULD YOU MEET AGAIN? As friends.

The Only Way Is Arg: The reality TV star's signature giggle crept in at times

   .....................................................................................................................................................................................................

Sixth date:  Romeo Dunn

While I was growing up, this big piece of So Solid Crew eye candy was present on every teenage girl’s wall in the shape of a poster from Mizz magazine. Having identified me as a ‘baby’ on the offset, my chance with him was doomed. I couldn’t tell nor did I care that Romeo was over a decade older than me (when did that happen?) – but, sadly, it wasn’t meant to be.

SCORE: 8/10 Hot ‘n spicy

BEST FEATURE: Sexy voice.

CONVERSATION: How he feels a little old next to me, and how he’s calmed down since the So Solid days.

FIRST IMPRESSION: Bad boy.

LASTING IMPRESSION? Nice boy.

WOULD YOU MEET AGAIN?  As friends (with a secret crush).

You used to be my Romeo: The So Solid Crew member was a little too old for Deni

  .....................................................................................................................................................................................................

Seventh date: Gary ‘Gaz’ Beadle

I hadn’t seen Geordie Shore before, but I’d heard about this guy. A notorious womaniser who gets way over and above his fair share of ladies, was there any point in competing for the apple of his eye? He was perfectly pleasant (and honest), but I couldn’t quite tell if he was after a girl to date or a girl for the night.

SCORE: 7/10 Too hot to handle

BEST FEATURE: Love the accent. For some reason I didn’t expect him to sound like that.

CONVERSATION: After posing him with the notion that he’s a ‘player’, Gaz defended with the fact he’s honest with the girls. His usual line is something along the lines of, ‘I’m in town for one night: do you want to come home with me?’ He may have been asking me, actually…

FIRST IMPRESSION: Naughty boy. Can’t wait to grill him.

LASTING IMPRESSION? What you see is what you get.

WOULD YOU MEET AGAIN? As friends.

Tashin' on: Gaz showed Deni how an introduction is done in Newcastle

  .......................................................................................................................................................................................................

Eighth date: Charlie King

A lovely way to end the date marathon, Mr King was sweet and genuine. He had lots of good conversation, great manners – and my gaydar didn’t go off once. I didn’t really fancy him but he had the sort of face to brighten up your day. This boy just needs to meet a nice girl.

SCORE: 6/10 Hotcake 

BEST FEATURE: Well groomed.

CONVERSATION:  Those annoying gay rumours and how TOWIE is filmed and staged.

FIRST IMPRESSION: Smiley.

LASTING IMPRESSION? Lovely, but not for me.

WOULD YOU MEET AGAIN? As friends.

Charmed, I'm sure: Charlie was sweet but Sam is the man Deni would love to see again
