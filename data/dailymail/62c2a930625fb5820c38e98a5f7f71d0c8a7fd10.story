The skeletal remains of a 3-year-old boy were found in Tucson on Tuesday and now his mother has been charged with starving him to death and stashing him in a trunk while his father did nothing to stop her.

Raquel Barreras, 39, and her husband Martin Barreras, 45, had been evicted from their triplex unit and the landlords were there cleaning up the squalid mess they left behind.

When they came across a 3x3 plastic toy box, they made the chilling discovery and court documents revealed Thursday that little Roman Barreras' final weeks may have been agonizing.

Unthinkable: Martin (left) and Raquel Barreras were arrested Wednesday after their 3-year-old son Roman's skeletal remains were found stuffed in a 3x3 toy box in apartment where they once lived

According to the complaint, Raquel let her son wither away and Martin confronted her but did nothing to stop it.

Their oldest daughter verified her mother's ruthless act.

Tucson Police Chief Roberto VillaseÃ±or said at a Wednesday press conference that the couple had four other children with them at their arrest and had been evicted from the 2-bedroom property were all seven of them were housed together after living there for less than one year.

Three of the children, aged 4 to 12, were taken into state custody. The fourth was aged 19 and not taken.

It wasn't the first time the children had been taken by the state.

The Division of Child Safety and 
Family Services told the Arizona Daily Star that caseworkers had contact
 with the family previously, but the last recorded contant was in August
 2012.

At one point, notes KVOA, the children were taken from the Barreras then returned.

The children appeared to be in good health at the time of their parents' arrest.

According
 to police, Roman was often kept in an 8x10 brick laundry room attached 
to the apartment near where his remains were found.

'The shock, it's surreal': The apartment owner said she found the remains under a pile of blankets wet with rain. Documents would later accuse Raquel of stuffing her son's body into the box after she starved him to death

The owners of the building nearly threw the chest away, believing it was just filled with more trash amongst the garbage covered patio where it was found.

When they moved a pile of blankets wet with rain, they discovered the child's bones.

'The shock, it's surreal, you look and you're like, could this really be,' the landlord said.

Equally shocked were members of the boy's extended family, who gathered for a press conference organized by a group for those affected by homicide on Thursday.

Suspicions: Some attendees of the press conference revealed that the Barreras had become secretive of late and had begun moving around frequently

'Roman was a beautiful baby boy, he had a lot to live for. We're asking you to pray for him while we are trying to get through this,' said a tearful Erica Ortiz, Raquel's neice. 'just remember him as a beautiful baby boy.'

Martin Barrera's cousin Oscar Romero spoke as well.

'The Barreras are in shock,' he said. 'I don't know what caused this. None of us do. And the question now is to find out the truth.'

Some of the gathered family revealed that Barreras moved often and had become quite secretive.

Police contacted them on Tuesday and they were found living in a home without running water near the Tucson Rodeo Grounds.
