Police say two people are dead and at least one person is injured after an explosion at a recycling plant in Granite City, Illinois, early Monday morning.

Bomb technicians were combing the site of TOTALL Metal Recycling, as emergency responders, who previously couldn't even enter the area for fear of another explosion, recovered the bodies of the victims, Granite City Police Major Jeff Connor said.

'We can't even approach the victims,' Connor had initially told the St. Louis Post Dispatch earlier in the day. 

The explosion was caused when a mortar round went off, and there are fears more mortars may still go off, causing more explosions.

Miguel Romo, 41, a maintenance worker at the plant, said he was inside a maintenance building when heard the blast, at around 6:30 am this morning.

Everyone was immediately ordered off the grounds, he said.

Romo fears his brother, Rudolfo Romo, 46, who also worked at the plant, is one of the two people killed in the explosion.

A former plant employee, Ryan Cerentano, 29, is claiming his half-brother, Tyler Muenstermann, 24, is the other victim.

Neither of these deaths have been confirmed. 

Cerentano added that there was 'a lot of unsafe stuff' inside the plant.

In 2011 and 2012, the plant was cited for violations of lead and respiratory protection, this according to Aaron Priddy, the area director of the Occupational Safety & Health Administration.

The TOTALL Metal Recycling website says the company recycles everything from computers to automobiles. It also indicates that the company deals with the ammunition industry.

Emergency responders and the bomb squad were forced to wait to enter the site for fear of more explosions

TOTALL Metal Recycling released this statement following the tragedy:

'This is an extremely difficult day for our entire TOTALL Metal Recycling family following the loss of two of our friends and colleagues this morning.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with the families as we collectively cope with this tragedy. We are committed to providing each employee and his or her family with counseling resources during this difficult time. 

'We are in full cooperation with local, state and federal authorities during their investigation of this most unfortunate incident. Again, we extend our most sincere condolences to the families and friends of those lost today.'
