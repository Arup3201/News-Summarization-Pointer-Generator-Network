Lionel Messi was the surprise omission as the three-man shortlist for the LFP's 'Best Striker of the 2013/2014' award was revealed on Friday.

Despite missing over two months of last season with a hamstring problem, the 27-year-old scored an impressive 36 goals in all competitions for the Catalan giants, but that wasn't enough for him to be recognised on this occasion.

Instead, reigning Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, former Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa and Real Sociedad starlet Carlos Vela were nominated for the award.

Cristiano Ronaldo: 1.03 goals/games average

Diego Costa : .77 goals/games average

Carlos Vela: .43 goals/games average

All three were the leading marksman for their respective sides last season, with Costa in particular playing a huge role in his sides' success as they pipped Barcelona to the La Liga title.

Costa, who joined Chelsea for £32million earlier this summer, scored 27 goals in 35 games as Atletico won La Liga for the first time in 18 years.

Elsewhere, there were no real surprises with Ronaldo's inclusion, as the golden boot winner notched 48 goals in all competitions for Real Madrid last season - the fourth year in a row the Portuguese star has scored over 30 goals in a season.

Despite not scoring as many goals as his other two competitors for the award, nor Messi, Vela played a pivotal role in keeping his side in European contention, scoring 16 goals in 37 matches for Sociedad.

The 25-year-old has impressed during his stint in Spain after failing to make an impact in England with Arsenal, recording his single-season high goal haul last season.

The winner will be announced at the awards ceremony on October 27.
