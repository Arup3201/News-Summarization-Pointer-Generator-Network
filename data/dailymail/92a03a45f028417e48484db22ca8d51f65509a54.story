A Virginia state lawmaker brandished an AK-47 on the floor of the state House of Delegates during a discussion on tightening gun controls.

Virginia Del. Joe Morrissey, a Democrat from Richmond, stood and held the weapon in the air with his right hand as he held a microphone in his right and addressed his fellow legislators. 

'A lot of people don’t know that in many locations in the Commonwealth, you can take this gun, you can walk in the middle of Main Street loaded and not be in violation of the law,' Morrissey said, according to Washington Examiner reporter Steve Contorno.

'Even though the law right now says you can't bring this gun into a high school or elementary or middle school, there is nothing from keeping you from walking in front of [an elementary school with a gun],' he added.

Morrissey assured that the gun was not loaded, but a Republican lawmaker wasn't convinced. Del. Todd Gilbert asked Morrissey to take his finger off the trigger lock.

Despite his stunt, a measure authored by Morrissey calling for tighter gun controls was rejected by a House subcommittee Thursday before making it to the floor for a vote.

The bill called for a ban on assault weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines.

The AK-47, which was designed in 1945, is one of the first assault rifles ever made and it is also the most popular. 

Morrissey's office told the Examiner that the AK-47 did not belong to the Morrissey and that it was borrowed from someone else.

In the aftermath of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn. that left 20 children dead, a number of lawmakers and activists have been going to great lengths to push for new gun laws in the U.S. 

NBC's David Gregory famously brandished a high capacity magazine on 'Meet the Press' last month during an interview with National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre. 

The stunt broke a law in Washington, D.C. - where the 'Meet the Press' studio is located - that bans the ammunition cartridges. 

Morrissey didn't break any laws, however, because Virginia state law allows weapons, including assault rifles, inside the Capitol.
