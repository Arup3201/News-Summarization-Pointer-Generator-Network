David Cameron, pictured today, is determined to push the policy through

David Cameron could publish plans to 
introduce a tax break for married couples as early as November, 
according to senior Downing Street sources.

The Prime Minister yesterday confirmed
that he would definitely recognise marriage in the tax system before 
the general election in 2015.

And a senior figure insisted Mr 
Cameron is prepared to overrule Chancellor George Osborne, who has 
repeatedly blocked the early introduction of the measure as many Tory 
MPs would like.

‘The Prime Minister is the First Lord 
of the Treasury,’ the senior figure said, pointing out that Mr Cameron 
is in ultimate charge of tax measures.

A No 10 official said the measure 
would be introduced in either an autumn statement or a budget, meaning 
the pledge could be fulfilled when the Chancellor makes his next 
announcement in November.

A pledge to recognise marriage in the 
tax system was included in the Coalition agreement three years ago but 
Mr Osborne has refused to include it in any of his budgets or autumn 
statements since.

Mr Cameron was asked during a local 
election campaign drive in Carlisle yesterday if he still intends to go 
ahead with his plans for the measure.

He said: ‘Yes I do, we set them out at
the last election in the Conservative manifesto.

'The Coalition 
agreement specifically said that while the Liberal Democrats don’t agree
with them they would abstain if we promoted them and that’s exactly 
what we’ll do before the end of this Parliament.’

Asked if it will be 
this year he added: ‘It will be before the end of this Parliament.’

Chancellor George Osborne and Deputy PM Nick Clegg are both thought to be against using the tax system to recognise marriage

But the ConservativeHome website 
reported yesterday that ‘on tax breaks for marriage, there are signals 
that the policy will be implemented, perhaps as early as the autumn’.

Tory MPs and Cabinet ministers 
including Iain Duncan Smith have urged Mr Cameron to introduce the 
measure no later than this year in order to reinforce the Government’s 
pledge to be the most family friendly ever, rather than leaving it until
2015.

Many believe it would placate Tory 
voters offended by the introduction of gay marriage, and stay-at-home 
mothers who will not benefit from new state support with childcare 
bills.

The decision to float the idea again 
now will be seen as an attempt to appeal to traditional voters ahead of 
the local elections on Thursday. The Tories are expected to lose 300 or 
more council seats, placing further strain on Mr Cameron’s relations 
with his party.

Eligible couples could be up to £150 better off from a tax break for people who tie the knot but one person does not work

The Prime Minister has a problem 
because when the 35 English councils up for grabs were last fought over 
in 2009, it marked a high watermark for Tory fortunes and the party won 
30 councils outright, picking up 1,531 seats.

This time, Labour is widely predicted to gain several hundred seats, while the Lib Dems will join the Tories in losing seats.

The exact details of the marriage tax 
plan have not been spelt out but it is assumed that the tax change would
mirror plans unveiled by the Tories before the 2010 general election.

The Conservative manifesto proposed a 
transferable tax allowance that would apply to all married couples – and
gay couples in civil partnerships – who pay the basic rate of income 
tax.

Spouses not using all of their 
tax-free personal allowance, either because they stay at home or work 
part-time and earn less than the threshold for basic rate income tax, 
were to be able to transfer £750 of their benefit to their working 
partner.

Eligible couples where one partner is 
not using all the tax-free personal allowance and the other earns up to 
£44,000 would be up to £150 a year better off.
