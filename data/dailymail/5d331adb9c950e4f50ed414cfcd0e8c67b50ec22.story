Julian Draxler is hoping to attract the attention of clubs such as Arsenal again once he sorts out his form at German club Schalke.

The 20-year-old playmaker was continually linked with a big money move to the Gunners in January but the switch fell through after Arsenal refused to meet his hefty £37million buy-out clause.

And the speculation looked to have affected Draxler's form as he went on to score just twice in the Bundesliga last season - leading to little interest being declared this summer.

Club displays: Draxler managed just two goals in the Bundesliga last season and interest in him has dropped

'The [buy-out clause] stayed with me,' he told Bild. 'I did not play like 20 clubs were ready to pay this sum for me last season. I have to become attractive to big clubs again.'

And the Germany midfielder is now hoping to match his achievements that first attracted Arsenal's interest with 10 goals during the 2012-13 campaign.

'This season, 10 goals should be possible for me. If our squad stays together, we can compete for the top three places. We can compete with Dortmund and Bayern.'

Quality: Arsenal were potential suitors but after a poor season £37million would be too high a price
