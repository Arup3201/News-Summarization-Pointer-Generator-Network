Since 1994, millions of women have grown up using Jennifer Aniston as a type of older sister. 

When the actress first came onto our screens as Rachel Green in 1994, her hairstyle spawned hundreds of thousands of copycats in salons across the western world.

When she gave the credit for her bikini body to The Atkins Diet, those same women ditched their meals of lettuce and grilled fish for steak and eggs. 

And after  she made the move to the silver screen, her legions of fans used their expendable income to turn her movies into Box Office gold.

We look back at some of the biggest highs and lows of Hollywood's ultimate Girl Next Door over the last two decades... 

The Brad Years: Our Love Of Her Love Life

Jennifer's five-year marriage to Brad Pitt was one of the most watched romances in celebrity history.

They were Hollywood's golden couple - gorgeous, happy and seemingly totally untouchable.  

The world became obsessed with Jennifer's seemingly perfect marriage to Brad Pitt

But Jennifer became the poster girl for  women scorned when the actor, now 51, ended their marriage and moved on with Angelina Jolie in 2005.

At the time, it  was widely reported that Brad had started his relationship with Angelina whilst they were filming Mr and Mrs Smith together, and he was still with Jennifer.

Three years later, Angelina appeared to confirm their on-set affair, when she said of the film: 'Not a lot of people get to see a movie where their parents fell in love.'

Later that year, Jennifer responded in an interview with American Vogue, where she referred to Angelina's  comments as, 'very uncool,' and, 'inappropriate.' 

Jennifer is now happily engaged to Justin Theroux, who she started dating in 2012 

In her first interview post-split in Vanity Fair in 2008, Jennifer went into detail about her tears, heartbreak and pain over the affair.  

But the article appeared to give the star closure and she had soon bounced back by dating John Mayer, Paul Sculfor and Vince Vaughn, before eventually meeting her now fiance Justin Theroux.

Several years on, the incident is well and truly under the bridge and recently Jennifer insisted there is no longer any bad blood between her and Angelina.   

In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, she said: 'I think that's slowly coming to an end. I really do.

'It's just tiresome and old. It's like an old leather shoe. 

'No, let's buy a new pair of shiny shoes.' 

The 'Rachel'  

During her time on the hit comedy show FRIENDS Jen became famous not just for her hilarious character Rachel Green, but for the 'Rachel' haircut. 

The layered look, that was styled by her still hairdresser Chris McMillan became one of the most asked for cuts of the 90s. 

The 'Rachel' haircut became one of the biggest hits of the 90s but Jennifer has since referred to it as a 'disaster'

Jennifer has since spoken about how difficult the look was to maintain. 

She said: 'The Rachel' was one of the hardest hairstyles to maintain. 

'Me and the blow dryer and the hairbrush weren't meant for each other. 

'It really was a "hairdo."'

Not only did the actress find it impossible to maintain, she has since revealed that she thought it was ugly.

In an interview with Allure magazine, she said: 'I think it was the ugliest haircut I've ever seen. How did that thing have legs?'

'It was all anyone ever wanted to know about, all Chris ever got asked to do. 

'I liked it at the time, but I started to grow it out after about eight months. 

'But it just wouldn't die.'

 

The 'Will She, Won't She' Child Debate  

Whether or not Jennifer will have children has been a source of great debate among the general public for years. 

Thousands of column inches in magazines have speculated on whether the actress is sporting a tiny bump, something the actress has revealed has been tough to endure.

Jennifer has revealed that she and Justin are trying for a baby 

Following her split from Brad, it was claimed that she hadn't wanted children, something which she went on to deny in her 2008 Vanity Fair interview. 

She said: 'A man divorcing would never be accused of choosing career over children. That really p**sed me off. 

'I've never in my life said I didn't want to have children. I did and I do and I will! 

'The women that inspire me are the ones who have careers and children; why would I want to limit myself? 

'I've always wanted to have children, and I would never give up that experience for a career. 

'I want to have it all.'

Jennifer, who looked stunning on the red carpet at the SAG Awards this year, has long spoken of her desire to have children

However, ten years on and Jennifer is still battling speculation over whether she will have a child, this with Justin.

In 2014, she was forced to once again to respond to the claims. 

She said: 'I don't have this sort of checklist of things that have to be done, and if they're not checked, then I've failed some part of my feminism or my value as a woman because I haven't birthed a child.

'I've birthed a lot of things and feel like I've mothered many things, and I don't think it's fair to put that pressure on people.'

And in 2015 she revealed to Hollywood Reporter that she and Justin are trying for a child, saying: 'Listen, that's a topic that's so exhausted. 

'I get nervous around that, just because it's very personal. 

'Who knows if it's going to happen? 

'It's been a want. We're doing our best.' 

 

The grown up years

Despite being one of the highest earning actresses in Hollywood, Jennifer's film career has always been criticised for being a little lacklustre.

She is best known for staring in rom-coms like Along Came Polly, He's Just Not That Into You and The Break-Up.

Jennifer looked happy at the unveiling of her Walk of Fame star in Hollywood in 2012

However, this year Jennifer's career has taken a turn for the  serious. 

After starring in the critically acclaimed Cake, Jennifer was even nominated for a SAG Award.

This is the first time the actress has truly gained recognition for her talents and seemingly signals a move away from the films she has starred in before. 

Jennifer has previously revealed that she enjoys the challenge of making people see that she is more than just a sitcom star, 'It excites me, actually,' she once said. 

After the success of her first foray into serious acting, it seems like we will be seeing much more of grown-up Jennifer as she reaches her mid-forties.
