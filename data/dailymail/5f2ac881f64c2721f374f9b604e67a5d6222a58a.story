A former aide of David Cameron's appeared in court today charged with possessing indecent images of children.

Patrick Rock, who stood down after being arrested in February, is facing charges of possessing scores of indecent images. He is also accused of ‘making’ indecent photographs of children, which can mean manipulating the images in some way.

He was granted bail on condition that he was supported by a 'welfare officer' appointed by his 'previous employer', Westminster magistrates were told. 

But Downing Street tonight insisted they had not appointed a welfare officer for the 63-year-old former Number 10 aide.

Former Downing Street adviser Patrick Rock, arriving at Westminster magistrates' court today, is charged with possessing 61 indecent images of children

Rock's trial is an embarrassment for Downing Street as he was heavily involved in drawing up Government policy on filters designed to block vile images of child abuse. 

He was arrested at his flat in Fulham, west London, on February 13 after suspicious colleagues called in police.

Today, Westminster Magistrates’ Court heard that the alleged offending occurred in the United States and that 62 indecent images were found on an iPad in North Carolina.

The images are all at the lowest Category C level meaning they showed children alone, it is alleged.

Rock today only spoke to confirm his name, date of birth and address.

The court heard that police and his former colleagues had concerns about his welfare and 'it was deemed appropriate that, for his own welfare, he needed to have contact with his own welfare officer'.

Mr Rock was a special advisor to the Prime Minister David Cameron

Christine Agnew, defending Rock, said that 'a specific welfare officer has been appointed at Mr Rock’s previous place of work' - Downing Street.

Rock was formerly deputy director of the Downing Street policy unit and one of Mr Cameron’s closest confidantes.

The two men have known each other for two decades and worked side by side for Michael Howard when he was Home Secretary in the 1990s.

Officers from the NCA – known as Britain’s FBI – searched his office and removed his laptop and other computer equipment.

Rock was bailed to return to Southwark crown court on July 17. Under his bail conditions, Rock must surrender his passport to police, reside at his home address in Fulham, west London, and maintain contact with a welfare officer.

The offence of making indecent images of children carries a maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment under section 1 of the Protection of Children Act 1978.

Possessing child abuse images has a statutory maximum of five years' imprisonment under section 160 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988.

In a statement last week Judith Reed, a senior lawyer with the CPS organised crime division, said: 'The decision to prosecute has been taken in accordance with the code for crown prosecutors.

'We have determined that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that a prosecution is in the public interest.

'May I remind all concerned that Mr Rock has a right to a fair trial. It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.' 

Mr Rock was one of David Cameron's closest aidea. The pair have known each other for 20 years and worked together in Number 10
