Kerry Kennedy’s hit-and-run crash may have been caused by a seizure, a family source claims.

Robert F. Kennedy’s daughter, ex-wife of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, was arrested for driving under the influence of drugs when she was found slumped over the wheel of her car after a collision in Westchester County, New York.

The family has since claimed she may be suffering from an undiagnosed medical condition which led her to black out at the wheel, the New York Post reported.

Heartbroken: Ms Kennedy speaking before the funeral of her best friend and sister-in-law, Mary Richardson Kennedy, in Bedford, New York in May

‘She does not remember how she got to
 the side of the road. All she remembers is feeling very woozy, and then
 the cops were there,’ the source told the paper.

‘They think she may have had some sort of seizure.’

Friday's collision came just two months
 after her best friend and sister-in-law Mary committed suicide after 
struggling with alcoholism and drug abuse.

On Saturday it was reported that 
Kennedy was under the influence of the sleeping drug Ambien when she 
smashed into a tractor trailer rig then fled the scene.

Ms Kennedy, 52, crashed into the big rig 
about 8am om Friday then drove off the highway. The collision damaged 
her car and left it with a flat tire.

Police arrived at the scene after a 911 call reported erratic driving on the freeway.

They then discovered Ms Kennedy passed out at the wheel of the white 2008 Lexus RS 350. There were no passengers.

She apparently told police that she had taken prescription sleeping pills - said to include the drug Ambien - before the accident, according to WABC.

After her arrest, Ms Kennedy was charged with driving while impaired with drugs.

She is due to appear in court in North Castle on Tuesday.

A spokesman for Ms Kennedy denied that she was under the influence.

Ken Sunshine told the New York Times: 'Kerry Kennedy voluntarily took breathalyzer, blood and urine tests – all of which showed no drugs or alcohol whatsoever in her system.

'The charges were filed before the test results were available.'

If Ms Kennedy is found to have been under the influence of Ambien, she could have a legal basis for combating the driving under the influence charge.

Ambien: Ms Kennedy said she was 'confused and erratic' when she told officers she may have taken the sleeping pill Ambien, which has been known in rare cases to cause 'sleep-driving'. But on Wednesday she said her 'first instinct' appears to be right after tests showed it WAS in her system the day of the crash

The 'Ambien defense' is a relatively new strategy that has been successfully used to clear drivers who had taken the medication before being arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated.

Doctors have recorded rare cases of the drug causing people to eat, walk and even get behind the wheel of a car while under the effects of the popular sedative. In those cases, the patients claimed to have no memory of their actions. As a result, courts have found they are not criminally liable for their actions.

However, most successful uses of the defense argument have come in cases where the defendants were found during normal sleeping times and often when they were discovered wearing pajamas.

Ms Kennedy, one of the most prominent members of the legendary Kennedy family, is the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and the niece of President John F. Kennedy.

Celebration: Ms Kennedy with Mr Cuomo during his first New York gubernatorial campaign in 2002

Her father was Senator for New York then U.S. Attorney General before being assassinated during his 1968 presidential campaign.

She re-entered the public eye as the wife of Mr Cuomo, a member of Bill Clinton's cabinet who was elected as Governor of New York in 2010.

The couple have three children but divorced in 2005 after 13 years of marriage.

Ms Kennedy was best friends with her sister-in-law Mary Richardson Kennedy, who killed herself at her New York home in May after her marriage to Robert F. Kennedy Jr disintegrated.

Kerry delivered an emotional eulogy at Mary's funeral, describing her friend as an 'angel' who had been destroyed by her own 'forces of evil'.
