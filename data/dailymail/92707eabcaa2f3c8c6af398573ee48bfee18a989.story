This is the horrific moment a commuter celebrating her birthday loses her arm after being pushed in front of a train by a man who ran laughing from the scene.

The graphic images - captured on a camera in the tube driver's cab - shows the casually-dressed suspect running up behind his victim and shoving her onto the track as the train enters a packed underground station in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo.

The attacker, who targeted Maria da Conceicao de Oliveira at random, ran away laughing, according to witnesses.

Targeted at random: Maria da Conceicao de Oliveira, who turned 28 that day, was rushed to hospital where medics amputated her right arm to save her life

The horrific attack happened just after 7am at Se Station, the busiest tube station in Sao Paulo, during Tuesday morning's rush hour.

Maria, who turned 28 the day of the horror incident, was rushed to hospital where medics amputated her right arm to save her life.

Police are hunting a man wearing a white T-shirt and black trousers seen running from the scene.

He is said to have tried to have steal a handbag and harassed another woman before targeting Maria, who is currently 'stable' in a city hospital intensive care unit.

Friend Ana Livia de Souza said: 'Maria has told me she feels born again and the accident was very ugly.'

Dad-of-one Ki-Suk Han, 58, was pushed off a tube platform to his death by a tramp in New York in December 2012.

Naeem
 Davis, 30, later claimed one of the reasons he pushed his victim to his
 death was because he had lost his Timberland boots and his head 'wasn't
 where it was supposed to be that day.'

Pictures
 published by the New York Post at the time showed Han desperately 
trying to lift himself back onto the platform alongside the headline: 
'Pushed on the subway track, this man is about to die.'

Transgender
 man Senthooran Kanagashingham, also known as Nina, was jailed at the 
Old Bailey in December 2011 for pushing a lawyer under a Tube train in 
central London.

Sonia Burgess, 63, died during the rush hour at King's Cross in October 2010.

A
