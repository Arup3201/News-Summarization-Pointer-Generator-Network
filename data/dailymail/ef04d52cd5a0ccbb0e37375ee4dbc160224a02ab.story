More than 10,000 people have been affected by an app spreading a virus under the guise of letting users change the colour of their Facebook profile.

Researchers at China-based company Cheetah Mobile have detected the Facebook color changer app was infecting customers' phones and computers with malicious software.

It has affected people in a number of countries but this is not the first time it has happened before, according to Cheetah Mobile.

The app has made several appearances over the past couple of years, including in 2012 and 2013.

Phone users are reporting is claiming it can change the colour scheme of their Facebook profiles and then they are redirected to a phishing website.

'Cheetah Mobile researchers have found this issue to be happening due to a vulnerability that lives in Facebookâ€™s app page itself, allowing hackers to implant viruses and malicious code into Facebook-based applications directs users to phishing sites,' the telecommunications company's website said.

'The code...takes users who believe they are visiting the URL "apps.facebook.com/themsandcolors" and automatically reroutes them to a malicious phishing site.'

On Android phones, the virus works by a warning popping up and telling users to download a suggested app (left) but to prevent the problem users should download a security app (right)

There are two ways phones or computers can be infected.

The first is by stealing information through access tokens, which allows hackers to connect with the users' Facebook friends.

If this tactic does not work, consumers are then asked to download a malicious application, while PC users are lead to a site to download a pornography video player.

On Android devices, a warning pops up telling users that their phone has been infected and then asks them to download a suggested app.

But those already infected should uninstall the app straight away and change their passwords.

To prevent further problems from happening, Cheetah Mobile also suggests turning off Facebook's apps platform, and for those who have not been infected install a security app.
