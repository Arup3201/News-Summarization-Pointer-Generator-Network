The British embassy is temporarily withdrawing some of its staff from Libya as political unrest in the country continues to grow.

A statement on the British embassy website said it was taking the measure because of concerns over the country's political uncertainty and the risk of clashes between rival armed groups in the capital.

'Given the security implications of the ongoing political uncertainty, the British Embassy is temporarily withdrawing a small number of staff,' the statement said, adding that the embassy would continue to operate as usual.

A British security source told Reuters only non-essential staff were affected.

The announcement comes just a few hours after a bomb exploded outside a police station in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi early this morning.

The police station building was damaged and the windows of a school opposite were shattered in the blast, a police official said.

'Someone threw a bag of explosive 
material in front of the gate of the police station in the city centre, 
causing a big explosion and serious damage,' the police officer said.

Around the same time, about 4 am, a second police station was hit by a smaller explosive device that may have been a grenade, a witness said. No injuries were reported there either.

Police stations have been struck with explosives at least four times in the past month in Benghazi, the second largest city in Libya.
