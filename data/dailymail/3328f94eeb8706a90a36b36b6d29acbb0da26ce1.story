They were born just two years apart, grew up close and spoke daily on the phone as adults.

But now, two sisters have been divided in court over  ex-NFL star Aaron Hernandez's murder trial. 

Last Wednesday, Shayanna Jenkins was pictured sitting solemnly behind her fiancé, Hernandez, the former New England Patriot tight end who has been accused of shooting dead  Odin Lloyd in 2013.

Just feet away, across the aisle, her sister, Shaneah Jenkins, was seen sitting alongside the family of her boyfriend, Mr Lloyd, 27, whose body was discovered in an industrial park in Massachusetts.

Accused: Last Wednesday, Shayanna  was pictured sitting solemnly behind her fiancé, Hernandez (pictured), the former New England Patriot tight end who has been accused of shooting dead Mr Lloyd in June 2013

Later in the hearing, Shaneah took the stand against Hernandez,  who has been pictured grinning in court a number of times. As she was cross-examined, her sister watched from the front row.

During that time, the siblings made eye contact only once as Shaneah spoke of hearing the news of her boyfriend's death and how Hernandez had asked her how she was coping only once after it.

The prosecutor then asked Shaneah if she had seen her sister in the courtroom, to which she replied 'no'. But when Shayanna craned her neck to make sure she was seen, she changed her response. 

The sisters, who shared a close bond just years ago, now appear to have a fractured relationship.

Shaneah, 25, and Shayanna, 23, who introduced Hernandez and Lloyd the year before the latter was killed, grew up together in Bristol, Connecticut and took similar paths, Shaneah told the court.

They both attended Bristol Central High School. During their last two years there, Shayanna began dating Hernandez. When he went to Florida to play football, Shayanna went to community college.

Killing: Hernandez (left) and Lloyd (right) first met less than a year before the latter was shot on June 17, 2013

After Hernandez, now 25, was drafted by the Patriots in 2010, Shayanna left college and moved with him to a Massachusetts condo. Two years later, Hernandez signed a $40 million contract. 

That November, Shayanna gave birth to a daughter, whom they called Avielle Janelle. The family moved into a mansion in North Attleborough, not far from Gillette Stadium.

Similarly to her sister, Shaneah enrolled in community college. However, she later transferred to Central Connecticut State University. She held down several jobs while majoring in criminology: at a home care company, for a law firm and at a Comfort Suites hotel in Southington, Connecticut.

It was there she met Mr Lloyd, who was carrying out electrical work with a crew staying at the hotel, in January 2012. They started dating and after Lloyd's work ended, their relationship deepened. 

Mr Lloyd, who lived in Dorchester, and Hernandez first met in August 2012, when, for the younger sister's birthday, Hernandez got a skybox for a Patriots game at Gillette Stadium.

After that, the men saw each other a few times a month, Shaneah told the court. She would stay with her sister and Hernandez when she went to Massachusetts to visit Lloyd every couple of weeks. 

'Almost every time I went there, he was with me,' Shaneah testified.

During those visits, while the sisters would hang out upstairs, go shopping or get their nails done, Lloyd and Hernandez would sometimes hole up in the basement 'man cave' and smoke marijuana, often with other people, Shaneah testified. A few times, the couples went to clubs together. 

By May 2013, Shaneah graduated college and had big plans: pursuing a law degree at New England School of Law. She was moving to Boston, she said, and she and Mr Lloyd planned to live together.

The next month, her boyfriend was dead.  

Investigation: Police officers stand near a bus sitting in front of Hernandez's North Attleborough, Mass, home on Friday. Mr Lloyd's body was discovered less than a mile away from the property, at an industrial park

Judge: Massachusetts Superior Court judge Susan Garsh, left, and a court officer, right, depart Hernandez's home on Friday, when a site visit was held for the jury. Hernandez has denied the charges against him

He was killed less than a mile from Hernandez's North Attleborough home.

Shaneah, now a second-year criminal law student, tearfully testified about receiving the call from police in the middle of the night. She called her mother. Her next call was to her older sister.

After heading to see Mr Lloyd's mother in Boston, Shaneah and her uncle drove to the home that Shayanna and Hernandez shared. 

Surveillance video played in court from inside the home showed Shayanna giving her a long hug. As she watched the video, Shayanna put her hand on her forehead, then wiped away tears.

But other parts of Shaneah's testimony seemed to agitate the older sister, who had her arms crossed and bounced her leg, occasionally emitting sighs as her sister spoke.

Shayanna pulled out a notebook and began writing notes at a few points, including when Shaneah said Hernandez had checked in with her only once to see how she was coping with Mr Lloyd's death. 

In the days after Mr Lloyd was gunned down, Hernandez's lawyer presented Shaneah with her own grand jury testimony, when she said he had periodically asked if she was OK.

Shayanna then shared the notes with Hernandez's legal team. It is not yet clear if Shayanna will testify. Prosecutors say they might call her.

They have accused her of getting rid of possible evidence at Hernandez's direction - a box from the basement - using her sister's car.

Shaneah testified she saw her sister carry a garbage bag to the basement after getting calls and texts the morning after Mr Lloyd's body was found.

Hernandez has denied his involvement in the June 17, 2013, killing.

Shayanna and Shaneah's mother, Jodi Jenkins, declined to comment to AP.

The siblings also have a 16-year-old sister. The trial continues.
