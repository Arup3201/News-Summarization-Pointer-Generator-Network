Treo the IED sniffer dog spent years in hostile territories hunting out bombs and weapons hidden by the Taliban.

But now he is retired the most taxing task he carries out is playing fetch with his owner and former handler Sergeant Dave Heyhoe in Congleton, Cheshire.

Treo, a black Labrador saved the lives of scores of British soldiers in Afghanistan and was even awarded the canine equivalent of the Victoria Cross for his services.

Man's best friend: Sergeant David Heyhoe with his dog Treo, in Congleton, Cheshire East. The dog spent years in hostile territories hunting out bombs and weapons hidden by the Taliban

Discovery: Treo's heroics include finding a 'daisy chain' improvised explosive device (IED) while working as a forward detection dog in Sangin, Helmand Province, in March 2008

Yet as a puppy he was a badly behaved 
rebel in danger of being put down until intensive Army training turned 
him into the gutsy canine described by his handler as the best military dog he has served alongside.

Treo was attached to 104 Military Working Dog Support Unit, Royal Army Veterinary Corps.

He instantly proved his worth in on his first patrol in a war zone finding a stash of weapons hidden in a hut at the back of a mud-walled compound.

He
made an impact as within weeks of Treo’s arrival, the Royal Marines 
were intercepting enemy radio messages mentioned targeting the 'black 
dog'

Treo's other 
notable heroics include finding a ‘daisy chain’ improvised explosive 
device (IED) while working as a forward detection dog in Sangin, Helmand
Province, in March 2008.

A daisy chain is two or more bombs 
wired together and concealed by the Taliban on the side of a path to 
maximise casualties among soldiers on patrol.

On alert: Treo was responsible for saving many lives by detecting around 46 bombs during his six-month tour of Afghanistan in 2008

Perfect pairing: According to the Army, his actions have also saved other soldiers and civilians from death or serious injury

In September 2008, Treo saved another platoon from guaranteed casualties when he again found a daisy chain.

According to the Army, his actions have also saved other soldiers and civilians from death or serious injury.

It can be common practice for handlers to request another dog if they believe they’ve got too close to their charge but Mr Heyhoe told the Sunday Times he would not swap Treo.

'You have to understand each other, recognise the slightest change in each other.'

'The trick is to channel your fear, knowing that this will make both you and the dog concentrate better. Although he was a black dog in 50C heat, I never doubted him.'

During the tour, only one man was 
killed, Justin Cupples, 29, who was Mr Heyhoe’s roommate.

The Taliban took the opportunity to activate another hidden explosive just after an incident which had left Heyhoe and Treo out of action

As he dealt with the death of his friend Heyhoe described himself as a 'broken man.'

He returned to Britain and retired from the army, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.

But he credits Treo with helping him through the darker days: 'He’s a proper dog who never gives kisses, but the times when I needed him, he’d sit beside me. He knew when I was suffering.'

Both Prince Charles and Gordon Brown 
have been introduced to the Labrador on his return to Britain from his 
many six-month tours of duty.

In 2009 Treo was honoured with the 
Dickin Medal from the People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals for his 
conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty.

Sgt Heyho accompanied Treo to the award ceremony at the Imperial 
War Museum in London, describing Treo as his ‘mate and best canine 
friend’.

PDSA director general Jan McLoughlin said at the time: ‘We look forward to honouring Treo with the Dickin Medal.

Fresh start: Treo can now enjoy his retirement in Congleton away from the dust and danger of Helmand

Happy retirement: These days Treo's biggest task is playing fetch with his master

Two of a kind: After Mr Heyhoe returned to Britain with post-traumatic stress disorder, he says his dog helped him through

'It is recognised throughout the world as the animals’ Victoria Cross. Treo is without doubt a worthy recipient.’

A Defence source said: ‘There is no doubt that Treo has saved many, many lives through his expertise.’

The life of a sniffer dog and his handler is fraught with danger and last month an Army dog was posthumously awarded the PDSA Dickin Medal

Theo, a 22-month-old springer spaniel cross suffered a fatal seizure just hours after his handler, Lance Corporal Liam Tasker, 26, was shot dead by the Taliban in March 2011.

The pair uncovered 14 bombs and hoards of weapons in five months on the front line - more than any other dog and handler in the conflict.

Military chiefs hailed them for saving the lives of countless British soldiers in Afghanistan.
