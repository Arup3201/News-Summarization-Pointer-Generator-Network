The new head of the Secret Service has admitted he has agents with a drinking problem after two were accused of crashing their car while drunk at the White House.

Joseph Clancy, newly-installed director of the agency, made the admission in a stormy session in front of Congress as he tried to get their approval to build a replica White House for agents to practice protecting the president.

He was told his answers were 'hogwash', berated for the string of failures by the Secret Service, and when he said he had to build the 'trust' of his employees, told bluntly by Republican Chris Stewart: 'Dude, you don't have to earn their trust. You're their boss!'

Clancy also admitted he did not know about the crash for five days, and said the two staff were still being fully paid and had not yet been disciplined, although they were on administrative rather than active duty.

The hearing itself was to be an exploration of Clancy's budget request for the 2016 fiscal year - including the $8 million he is asking for to build a scale replica White House. 

But 'the 800-pound gorilla in the room,' as Homeland Security subcommittee chairman Rep. John Carter said, was 'what happened the other night at the White House.'

A SECOND WHITE HOUSE? The Secret Service wants to build a scale model of the presidential mansion in Maryland so agents can be trained in a facility that's just like the real thing – but it probably won't include today's St. Patrick's Day fountain

Clancy had few answers to questions about an early March incident in which two agents were accused of drunk-driving a government car through a White House barricade after an after-hours party. 

On-duty officers at the scene, according to The Washington Post, wanted to arrest the agents and administer sobriety tests, but a supervisor overruled them and allowed the suspects to go home.

Worse, they appeared to have driven over a 'suspicious package' that their fellow agents were in the process of investigating. 

Clancy, it emerged on Tuesday, was only told of the incident five days later. He said 'there will be accountability'.

He promised new 'ethics training' and said he had moved the accused officers to 'non-supervisory' desk duty, but with 'no financial penalties' such as a salary reduction or a suspension without pay.

'It's going to take time, perhaps, to change this culture,' he said, referring to a fast-and-loose attitude inside the agency he inherited after former director Julia Pierson resigned last year. 

He said the Secret Service has a rule prohibiting the consumption of alcohol '10 hours before your duty assignment.' But 'we don't have protocols for off-hours' activities,' he added.

'There's an element within our agency that does cope with stresses... by using alcohol,' Clancy said, noting that the agency recently launched an initiative to address stress.

'We've got to find a way to help some of these people that are going toward alcohol as a coping mechanism.'

POROUS BORDER? An early March off-duty party led to an incident where the agents drove through an active crime-scene investigation and crashed through a White House barrier

Panel members were impatient when Clancy insisted he had to wait to impose discipline until his agency's Inspector General competed its own investigation.

Carter, a Texas Republican, insisted that he 'terminate' them 'as punishment. ... We'll be watching. And waiting.'

'I don't care about the Office of Inspector General,' he barked. 'God love them and good luck to them. You're in charge.'

'I'm disappointed that you have not waged your own vigorous, tough investigation,' Carter lectured him.

'To say you're not investigating because you want the IG of the department to investigate is hogwash. What do you think?'

Clancy suggested he had to earn agents' trust as the new director of the agency, earning a scathing response from Carter.

'Dude, you don't have to earn their trust. You're their boss!' he said. Clancy, visibly agitated and stammering, was easy pickings.

'I'm very frustrated that we didn't know about this, that I didn't know about this. I'm frustrated that we can't act until we know all the facts,' he said.

'I just don't want to act improperly too soon. Let me say this: The president, the first lady, they're safe. We've moved these individuals to administrative positions.'

SECURE? The US Secret Service has come under fire after a series of embarrassing incidents that call into question its performance protecting the White House and the first famil

GRILLED: Clancy insisted that the allegedly drunk-driving officers have been moved to desk duty, but congressmen want them fired

Clancy's budget request included $8 million to build a scale model of the White House in a Maryland suburb for training purposes, in the hope that other institutional face-palm moments might not repeat themselves.

In the last year a series of fence jumpers have made it onto White House grounds, including one who breached the building itself while carrying a knife in his pocket.

And it took the Secret Service four days to determine that a rifleman had struck the presidential residence.

'The Secret Service currently uses a rudimentary, not-to-scale simulation of the north grounds of the White House, using bike barricades to act as the fencing,' Clancy said. 'There are no structures, vehicle gates, lighting or other aids to enhance the training simulations.'

The carbon copy of America's presidential mansion, if Congress approves, would be built in Beltsville, Maryland, about 20 miles from the real White House, on 500 acres that already serve as a Secret Service training site.

Kentucky Republican Rep. Hal Rogers suggested Congress will take a trust-but-verify approach to giving Clancy what he's asking for. 

'We're going to provide adequate funding for your agency,' he said. 'But it's going to be on a short string. We expect results.'
