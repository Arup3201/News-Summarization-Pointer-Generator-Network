Still feeding off yesterday's stock surge, the Dow Jones industrial average closed with its second record high in two days.

The Dow closed up 42.47 points to finish the day at 14,296.24, which was the highest total seen since the October 2007 high of 14,198, a new indication of a strengthening U.S. economy.

'Stocks don't seem expensive here,' said Paul Hogan, co-manager of the FAM Equity-Income Fund in Cobleskill, New York.

Upward swing: The Dow has been enjoying healthy gains so far in 2013, increasing 9 per cent as the U.S. economy continues to strengthen

'All the headlines that were 
generated because of what happened yesterday with the Dow hitting new 
all-time highs, that makes more people take notice of the strength in 
the stock market. It may be bringing people in off the sidelines.'

The gains, however, were slight on concerns the rally may run out of steam in the short term.

The slowly healing labor market has been one of the weaker spots of the recovery but data today showed private sector hiring was surprisingly strong in February as companies added 198,000 employees.

It was an early look at the labor market two days ahead of the closely watched non-farm payroll report from the government on Friday, which is expected to show the economy created 160,000 jobs last month while the unemployment rate held at 7.9 per cent.

In the morning, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 45.61 points, or 0.32 per cent, to 14,299.38.

But the Nasdaq Composite Index dipped 1.77 points, or 0.05 per cent, to close unofficially at 3,222.36.
