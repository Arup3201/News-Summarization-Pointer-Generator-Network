The secret to everlasting life may have been found, if this 19th century ‘miracle cure’ proves to be the real deal.

In May, archaeologists found bottles beneath a hotel construction site in New York that once contained medicinal remedies.

One of these, called the 'Elixir of Long Life' was once believed to be capable of cheating death, and the team are now preparing to make it and try the miracle cure for themselves.

A team of archaeologists is to recreate a liquid concoction once used for medicinal purposes. Chrysalis Archaeology claim a remedy known as the Elixir of Long Life was believed to have once been stored in a glass vial (pictured), which was found beneath a construction site in New York

The find of hundreds of bottles detailing drinking and eating habits from 150 years ago was made during an excavation under the construction site in Chinatown, New York.

Ingredients

Aloes -  0.46 ounces (13 grams)

Rhubarb - 0.08 ounces (2.3 grams)

Gentian - 0.08 ounces (2.3 grams)

Zedoary (also known as white turmeric) - 0.08 ounces (2.3 grams)

Spanish saffron - 0.08 ounces (2.3 grams)

Water - four fluid ounces (114 millilitres)

Grain alcohol (vodka, gin) - 12 fluid ounces (240 millilitres)

Method

Squeeze out the liquid from the aloes.

Crush the rhubarb, gentian and saffron together and then mix them with the aloe liquid.

Then let the mixture sit for three days but shake it every so often.

It will then need to be filtered before it can be served.

The site had previously been a German beer garden and music hall established in 1858 called the Atlantic Garden.

One of the bottles found was a small greenish bottle that, upon closer inspection, seemed to have once contained a drink intended to grant the consumer a longer life.

The team behind the find at Chrysalis Archaeology decided to find out for themselves what exactly the drink was.

They tracked down the recipe from a medical guide and found it contained ingredients still in use today.

‘We decided to engage in our own brand of experimental archaeology,’ president of Chrysalis Alyssa Loorya told DNAinfo.

‘We wanted to know what this stuff actually tasted like.’

The drink itself contains a few herbs and a lot of alcohol, with the team suggesting it is best to drink it one drop at a time rather than in gulps.

A second drink, known as Dr Hostetters Stomach Bitters, another popular medicine used to apparently cure ailments, was also unearthed.

This contains gentian root, orange peel, cinnamon, anise, coriander seed, cardamom seed, peruvian bark, gum kino, grain alcohol, water and sugar.

The team are planning to recreate both drinks in the coming weeks - although they’ve also released recipes for both so that people can make the cocktails themselves.

Such miracle concoctions were apparently quite common in the 19th century and they were often found in bars.

‘Long before the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] was formed, doctors and chemists of the late 19th century invented a number of interesting concoctions to treat common ailments,’ Chrysalis wrote on their blog.

‘Bottled in glass and given almost comical names, they were sold at neighbourhood apothecaries.

‘Practicing our own brand of experimental archaeology, we’ve decided to recreate the past based on medicine bottles we recently found at an archeological site.

‘We’re excited that we’ve tracked down actual recipes for an “Elixir of Long Life” and “Stomach Bitters” to match up with labels on our old bottles.

‘Since both formulas required copious amounts of alcohol as a medium, it may have been difficult for consumers to determine whether the ‘active ingredients’ were actually effective. ‘

The team also added that, perhaps surprisingly, many of the ingredients are still used today.

‘Gentian, for example, is still used to stimulate appetite and treat gastric complaints and jaundice.’

Cinnamon, meanwhile, is believed to reduce blood-sugar levels, while aloe is popular for treating burns says the team.

‘We’re not expecting the results of our experiment to extend life expectancy or threaten the modern gastroenterologist’s salary range,’ they add, ‘but at least we’ll show off our chemistry prowess and relive the meticulous work and interesting fragrances of yesteryear’s snake oil industry.’
