A dramatic rescue successfully pulled two men off a maintenance scaffold 45 stories above Manhattan that folded in half, trapping them.

For about an hour and a half, two maintenance workers dangled nearly 600 feet in the air, pinned to the side of the iconic Hearst Tower when their rigging bent in a a v-shape around 2:40pm Wednesday.

New York Fire Department officials were on the scene immediately, securing the men with safety rope.

Daring rescue: Two men hung from window washing scaffolding after their equipment bent in two while working on Midtown Manhattan's Hearst Tower. Rescue workers look down at them from the roof 46 stories upÂ 

A day's work: The men remained calm throughout the ordeal, though it lasted an hour and a half. Here, they can be seen on either side of the buckled platform

The quick-thinking rescue lasted for under two hours.

At which point the men, named Victor and Steve, were pulled from the rig through windows that were cut open by rescue workers 44 floors up at around 4:15pm.

A four foot by four foot section of the thick glass was cut through using special tools.

'Once we secured them from the roof, we cut the glass, other members lowered me out onto the scaffolding,' said FDNY firefighter Tom Gayron at a press conference. 'I assisted the members back into the building.'

One on each side of the bent scaffold, the two men remained impressively calm throughout the ordeal. Not surprisingly, since they routinely dangle from hundreds of feet up as part of their everyday job.

Brave: New York Fire Department officials responded immediately after the scaffold failed at 2:40pm. They immediately secured each maintenance worker and remained at the top of the building throughout he ordeal

One spoke on a cell phone while he 
stood. The other appeared to remain in a more seated position 
for most of the ordeal.

Rescue workers later said the men were even smiling once first responders arrived, believing from that moment everything was going to be fine.

The scaffolding is designed to fold in the middle, but may have failed to lock properly at the time it was lowered.

The men, a 26-year-old from the Bronx and a 49-year-old Brooklyn man, were nearly at the top of the 46 floor high tower.

Meanwhile, the scaffolding itself remained hanging dangerously from the side of the tower.

Asst. Fire Chief William Seelig said the men were in no danger of falling once they were secured with safety ropes.

The men were immediately examined by EMS inside the building and appeared to be in good condition.

'They were all smiles, thankfully,' said FDNY paramedic Moses Nelson. 'No major injuries, no complaints.'

Communication: The men were standing and one spoke on a cellphone during the rescue - they remained impressively calm

A New York Magazine report recently 
called the Hearst Tower's window washing scaffolding system, which cost 
around $3 million, New York's most complex, reports NBC.

It is suspended by six wire ropes to the crane-like rigging above and is monitored for problems by a system that
includes 67 electromechanical safety sensors and switches.

By around 5:30, the scaffolding was being raised to the top of the tower. The New York State Department of Labor will be investigating the incident, according to an FDNY official.
