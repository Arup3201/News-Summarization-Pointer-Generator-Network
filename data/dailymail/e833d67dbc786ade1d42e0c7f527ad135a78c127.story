It is a common topic around the festive dinner table - memories of perfect white  Christmases of the past.

However, US Government forecasters have revealed that in fact, they are actually far more common in recent years.

The map they created reveals that only in a few areas (marked in brown) actually had more white Christmases in the past.

The map shows the percent change in snow-covered days over the week of Christmas between 1990 to 2013 and 1966 to 1989. The colour blue indicates areas where the ground was more frequently snow-covered in recent years. Brown indicates areas where Christmases in longer-ago decades were indeed whiter.

The map below shows the percent change in snow-covered days over the week of Christmas between 1990 to 2013 and 1966 to 1989.

Places where the ground was snow-covered up to 25 per cent more frequently in recent decades are coloured in shades of blue, and places that were snow-covered up to 25 per cent less frequently are coloured shades of brown.

'Many of us wondered whether we could trust our memories of how snowy the holidays were when we were kids compared to now,' the Goverment's climate team wrote.

'Just for fun, we asked the experts at the Rutgers Snow Lab to show us what their data (based on NOAA satellite images) had to say about whether the U.S. snow extent during the week of Christmas has changed at all in the past 50 years. 

'As you can see, fans of glistening tree tops have had a better time in the past few years - there seem to have been more white Christmases between 1990 to 2013 in the U.S.'

Places where the ground was snow-covered up to 25 per cent more frequently in recent decades are coloured in shades of blue, and places that were snow-covered up to 25 per cent less frequently are coloured shades of brown.

According to the Rutgers, there has been a modest increase in snow extent during the holiday week today compared to the past for the country as a whole, although it clearly varies a lot from place to place.

Further, the scientists emphasize, singling out a particular winter week for scrutiny isn’t especially meaningful as an indicator of long-term climate change.

When it comes to meaningful indicators of how snow has changed over time, the scientists say, it’s best to stick to monthly or seasonal averages. 

By those indicators, says David Robinson, who leads the Rutgers snow lab project, the pattern is clear: Northern Hemisphere snow cover is declining significantly at the end of the cold season (spring/early summer).

This pattern of snow disappearing earlier in the spring makes intuitive sense with respect to global warming. 

As temperatures rise, the impact on snow cover is likely to show up first in those seasons where the temperature is just barely cold enough for snow. 

Reductions in snow can also feed back on the atmosphere, amplifying warming. 

Where winter temperatures are well below freezing, however, temperatures will have to rise more significantly before snow cover is affected.
