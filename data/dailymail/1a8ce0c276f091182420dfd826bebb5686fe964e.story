Wigan Athletic star James McArthur has spoken of his devastation after his FA Cup winners' medal was stolen during a burglary at his home in Wigan.

The 26-year-old player's house was burgled sometime between Tuesday 20 May and Monday 26 May 2014, with the raiders also stealing two wedding rings.

McArthur won the FA Cup medal when his team beat Manchester City 1-0 in the final at Wembley in 2013.

He said: 'I am devastated about the burglary at my home. My cup final winners' medal has been stolen as well as my wedding rings.

'I am due to get married in the near future and this is an awful thing to happen to us before the wedding.

'If anybody has any information as to where my property is and can help the police return it to me, I would be very grateful.'

Detective Constable Kevin Telford, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Understandably, Mr McArthur and his family are devastated someone has broken into their private property and stolen their possessions.

'Not only has an FA Cup medal been stolen but two rings that were going to be used in Mr McArthur's wedding have been taken. They are of huge sentimental value to them and while the rings can be replaced, the medal is something that cannot.

'It is unlikely the offenders will keep hold of the medal and may try to sell it on. Obviously, it is unusual for such an item to come on the market so I would ask anyone who is offered the medal or who has any information as to where the items are, to contact police.'
