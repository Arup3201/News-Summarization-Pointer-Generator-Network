The partner of 'Charb' – Stephane Charbonnier, editor of Charlie Hebdo – has said she always knew he would be assassinated.

In emotional interviews, 41-year-old Jeannette Bougrab said: 'I always knew he was going to die like Theo Van Gogh (the Dutch cartoonist murdered in 2004).'

'I begged him to leave France but he wouldn't. My companion is dead because he drew in a newspaper.'

Miss Bougrab, who had lived with Charb and her adopted daughter May for three years, added sadly: 'He never had children because he knew he was going to die. He lived without fear, but he knew he would die.'

The lawyer and former French Secretary for Youth and Community Life described to French TV station BMFTV how she got the news he was killed.'I was at a state meeting and I learned there had been a shooting,' she said.

'Then I sent him a text, a second text, third text, and then I phoned him and he wasn't answering and he never did that.

'When I got there, there were the cordons and we weren't allowed to get in and I learned there that he was dead.'

Proudly, Bougrab added: 'He died standing.

Hitting out at the inadequate security given to the satirical magazine and its staff, she later told TF1: 'I haven't lost Charlie Hebdo. I've lost a loved one. 

'I am here, not as a former government minister, but as a woman who has lost her man, who has been murdered by barbarians.

'I admired him before I fell in love with him and I loved him because of the way he was, because he was brave. He thought that life was a small thing when he was defending his ideals.

'Do you know people capable of dying for their ideas today? No. Because they've just died, they've just been murdered. 

'That's the reality, we could have avoided this massacre. We could have avoided it and we didn't.'

Asked if she had been comforted by the world's adoption of the 'Je Suis Charlie' symbol and that it could be seen as a sign of victory, of hope, Bougrab said passionately: 'Absolutely not, because he's dead. It's absolutely not a victory. 

'It's a defeat. It's a tragedy for our country and I refused to rejoice in the idea that people are demonstrating in the streets because they have torn away the precious being who accompanied me in life.'

She admitted herself that she and Charb were an unlikely pairing although she'd been fascinated by him before they met.

He was a communist, she a member of UMP, the centre right party.

'I have lost my love, lost a part of me. I was with a hero I admired. We tried to live normally but it was complicated.'

Now she would like to see all the murdered cartoonists buried in the Parthenon where Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau lie.

'They died defending freedom of expression, secularism. They died so we can stay free in this country in France in 2015.' 

Miss Bougrab is one of many people trying to cope with the sudden and shocking loss of their relatives. 

The wife of Charlie Hebdo cartoonist, Georges Wolinski - who was among 12 people killed in the massacre in Paris - described the horror of learning about her husband's death through the news.

Maryse Wolinski told RTL: 'Nobody official told me - I was quite shocked by that. Talking about my husband in the aftermath of this horrific shooting is not very easy.

'I think he died with his comrades, with his brothers, such as Cabut - in the service of his beloved freedom, for which he has always fought.'

Regarding the controversial nature of their illustrations and the danger it brought, the children's author said: 'My husband was not aware of such things, he was going forward, he fought with his drawings with pencils, leaning on her drawing board.'

Maryse and Georges' daughter, Esla, posted a picture of her father's office on Instagram with the caption: 'Dad is gone, Wolinski is not.'

She has since told Europe1

"I wish that all this is only a joke." 

"He was a man who was afraid. Afraid of what society would become, afraid of the world we were going to leave to his grandchildren."

 

"I thought we could stop in the street, show his disagreement, but I did not think we killed designers, "

 

" I'm afraid this is the beginning of a long series , we will have to be all welded, but we are very fortunate to be as supported in the world. I was surprised by the generosity and emotion. "
