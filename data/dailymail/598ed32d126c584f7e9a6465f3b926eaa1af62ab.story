Apple fans hoping for a bargain this Christmas have had their appetites whetted after details of the tech giant's so-called 'Black Friday' sale were apparently leaked.

The sale, set to take place at Apple stores worldwide and online tomorrow, will include some of the deepest cuts ever made by the company.

The best discounts will be on Apple's big-ticket items, with $101 knocked off the retail prices of the the Macbook Pro, Macbook Air and iMac.

The company's iPad tablet computers will be offered at lesser discounts of between $41 to $61, iPods with $21 to $41 off, and iPod Nanos will be discounted by $11.

Fans of Apple's mobile phones will be disappointed, however, as it looks like there will be no discount on the iPhone 4S or any of its predecessors.

Fan site 9-5mac.com claimed a 'trusted tipster' leaked the details of the 2011 sale prices to them. The site has published pictures of 
what appears to be a printed brochure detailing the special discounts, 
which are some of Apple's deepest yet.

But news of the sale was met with mixed responses from online technology commentators. ZDNet's Jason O'Grady described the discounts as 'anaemic'.

In previous years Apple has resisted heavily discounting its products, relying on their brand's hefty consumer appeal to drive sales - even as rivals make heavy price cuts.

The discounts come as the Consumer 
Federation of America warned retailers face a tough festive season, with
a survey showing consumers feel the financial situation has 
deteriorated over the past year.

The group found 37 per cent of 1,011 
respondents said their financial condition is worse today than it was 
this time last year, compared to 30 per cent who say their finances have
not changed since last year.

Nevertheless,
some retailers have gone all out to try to lure more shoppers to their 
doors, with special opening hours creeping further back into the 
Thanksgiving holiday.

Walmart and Toys'R'Us have pushed their opening times into Thanksgiving evening, opening at 9pm and 7pm respectively. Target has provoked the outrage of its staff with its opening time tonight.

Tens of thousands of Target employees have signed a petition objecting to its 12am opening time tonight in anger at being taken away from their families on the Thanksgiving holiday.

With household budgets already so stretched, 10 per cent more people are expected to shop for their Christmas gifts on Black Friday this year than last year, according to a National Retail Federation (NRF) survey.

Retailers are hoping that a string of discounts will help to persuade shoppers not to cut back too heavily on Christmas purchases amid the gloomy economic outlook.

The NRF's survey also found that 62.2 per cent of Americans said the state of the economy would have an effect on their plans for spending over the festive season, and most people said they would be hunting for sales and discounts.

News of Apple's discounts comes as speculation grows that the company will add to its 358 outlets worldwide with its biggest yet at New York City's Grand Central Station.

Reports suggest a new space in Manhattan bustling train terminus will top the size of the corporation's massive 25,000-square-foot Regent Street location in London.

An online video appears to give a walk-through tour of the site - but the corporation was giving little away about rumours it would be officially opened on Black Friday.
