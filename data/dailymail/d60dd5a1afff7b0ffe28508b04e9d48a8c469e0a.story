A TV commercial featuring the presenter on ITV’s This Morning, Ruth Langsford, who heralded the benefits of eye correction surgery, has been banned.

The wife of fellow TV celebrity Eamonn Holmes appeared in a commercial for an eye lens replacement treatment sold under the Clarivu brand.

The 53-year-old presenter said she had been able to throw away her glasses after having the treatment, which claims to restore both long and short sight.

This Morning host Ruth Langsford said she had been able to throw away her glasses after having the treatment which claims to restore both long and short sight

However, an eye specialist complained that there is no guarantee patients will not need glasses, particularly for reading, after the treatment.

Now the Advertising Standards Authority(ASA) has banned the commercial on the grounds it was misleading.

The Clarivu surgery is most effective for people over 50 who cannot be helped by laser eye surgery. It involves removing the lens at the front of the eye and replacing it with a synthetic multifocal alternative.

In theory, the surgery, which costs £3,495 per eye, means people can see items that are close up or far away.

Claims: But the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned the commercial on the grounds it was misleading

Miss Langsford was featured in the 
commercial saying: ‘As a TV Presenter it was so frustrating having to 
rely on glasses and contact lenses, but for me laser eye surgery wasn't 
suitable.

'Then I discovered Clarivu from the eyecare experts at Optegra.

‘Clarivu corrects both long and short sightedness in a proven and permanent lens replacement procedure.

‘Clarivu has changed my life forever.  Goodbye glasses, hello Clarivu. See my story at Optegra.com.’

Optegra provided a raft of independent research and clinical evidence to demonstrate the success of advanced intra-ocular lenses (IOL) in providing near, intermediate and distance vision correction.

It said that Clarivu represented a new category of eye surgery ‒ refractive lens exchange for those over 50 years of age ‒ which did not exist before.

However, the eye specialist told the ASA  that his understanding was that the multifocal lenses could not yet provide the full range of near vision correction to remove the need for glasses.

The watchdog said it did accept that there is good evidence to believe the replacement lenses ‘could provide sufficient correction of both long and short distance vision to the extent that many patients would no longer require glasses or contact lenses’.

However, it said this was not guaranteed for all patients. Consequently, it concluded that the claims made by Miss Langsford and Optegra were misleading.

The ASA said: ‘The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Optegra UK Ltd not to imply that all consumers who underwent the Clarivu procedure would no longer require glasses or contact lenses after the procedure if that was not the case.’

As a result Optegra edited their advertisement and an amended version of it is now running.

Today Optegra released a statement saying: 'Following comments from the ASA, an amended version of the Clarivu advert featuring Ruth Langsford was resubmitted, received ASA and industry approval, and has been broadcasting on ITV since 27 January.

'Optegra has a rigorous clinical evaluation and consenting process with all patients carried out by our expert ophthalmic surgeons.  All risks and benefits associated with all eye surgery are made clear at the point of consultation ahead of consent.

'The advert features Ruth Langsford’s personal experience as a patient. Like the vast majority of our Clarivu patients, Ruth achieved 20/20 vision after the Clarivu procedure, and is delighted to be free of glasses.  The procedure is not suitable for everyone and will depend on the individual patient’s vision and lifestyle needs.

A Homebase advert for LED lighting has been banned

An
 advert by DIY giants Homebase has been banned for being misleading 
after claiming its LED lightbulbs would slash £146-a-year off the 
average household's electricity bill.

The ad stated the the TCP 
LED (light-emitting diode) lightbulbs would save the average householder
 £146 on their current electric bills each year - but only if they 
replaced 25 normal bulbs with the LED bulbs.

It stated: 'Discover LED lighting today - save up to £146.

'Average household can save up to £146 on their lighting energy bills.'

The direct mailing ad claimed: 'Energy costs have risen over the last five years by 50 per cent, from 10p to 15p per kilowatt.

'Reduce your bills now with this brand new extensive range of LED options for rooms in the home.

'Over 40 LED bulb options to choose from. Most comprehensive range of high performance LED'.

Tiny
 text at the bottom of the ad stated: 'Saving based on replacing 25 
standard bulbs with LED bulbs and using for an average of 2.7hrs per day
 for a year - based on average usage of 1,000 hours per year (3 hours 
per day)'.

One person complained to the Advertising Standards 
Authority (ASA) saying they did not believe the savings and that ad was 
misleading and could not be proven.

Bosses at the ASA banned the 
ad, saying it was misleading - saying Homebase had provided 'no 
evidence' the average household had 25 lightbulbs, making the claims 
unrealistic.
