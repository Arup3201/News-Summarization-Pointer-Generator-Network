The bridge which carried interstate traffic through downtown Cleveland fell in a matter of seconds when engineers detonated explosives in a military-style demolition.

Nearby neighbourhoods shook as the Innerbelt Bridge's remaining skeleton of steel girders collapsed after more than 50 years of holding up the main artery into the north-east Ohio city.

Nearly a thousand locals who had gathered at East 14th Street and Broadway to watch the demolition cheered as the landmark was obliterated in a millisecond.

The 55-year-old bridge, which had aged faster than expected, is to be replaced with two new bridges, the first of which has already been built and the second of which is due for completion in 2016.

At around 6am on Saturday morning, engineers pressed the button to detonate 182lbs of explosives placed at 88 crucial spots which, in half a second, sent the remaining 5,000 tons of tumbling to the ground below.

Shortly before, a smaller 'scare charge' had been let off to scatter any peregrine falcons or other birds roosting in the superstructure.

The spans on each end of the bridge, and over the Norfolk Southern railway and Cuyahoga River, which couldn't be blown up, had already been manually dismantled, leaving five of the nine spans for explosive demolition.     

The Innerbelt Bridge had carried Interstate-90 traffic in and out of downtown Cleveland since 1959.

It was taken out of use last November, with traffic transferred onto the first of the dual bridges that will replace it, which are named after retired Ohio senator George Voinovich.

Baltimore firm Controlled Demolition handled the razing of Innerbelt Bridge. Its president, Mark Loizeaux, told Cleveland.com's Alison Grant that for him it was 'just another day at the office'.
