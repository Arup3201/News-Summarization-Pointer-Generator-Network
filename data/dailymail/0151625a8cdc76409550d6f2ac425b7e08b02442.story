Taxi company Uber's low-cost carpooling service, UberPOP, is set to be banned in France from January next year, the government said.

The ruling comes after hundreds of taxi drivers blocked roads around Paris to protest what they claim are its unfair business practices.

Drivers blocked the roads heading from the Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport, then inched toward the French capital in their latest protest of the ride-sharing company.

Un appy: Uber's low-cost carpooling service, UberPOP, will be banned in France from January 1

The new law tightening regulations for chauffeured rides will effectively ban the UberPOP service as of January 1st, Pierre-Henry Brandet, spokesman for France's Interior Ministry, said.

'Currently, people who use UberPop are not protected if there is an accident. So not only is it illegal to offer this service but for the consumer there is a real danger,' Brandet told the BFM television network.

France is the latest of several places where Uber has faced challenges to its service, which matches people seeking rides with drivers through a cellphone app. 

Traditional taxis say Uber has an unfair advantage because its drivers don't face the same requirements, insurance and taxes.

On Friday, a French court stopped short of banning the company but ordered Uber to make changes, including omitting 'all mention suggesting it is legal' for its drivers to act like taxis — that is, driving around and waiting for clients.

Parisian taxi drivers are fed up with what they see as unfair competition from Uber's UberPOP, which uses non-professional drivers using their own cars to take on passengers at budget rate

This comes after Uber services were banned in Spain, Holland and the Indian capital New Delhi just last week.

UberPOP is a peer-to-peer carpooling service offered through the Uber app.

Unlike the normal UberX, which is a taxi with a professional licensed driver, anyone can register their car to UberPOP.

The service cuts the normal taxi fare with around 50 per cent.

A Madrid judge ordered Spanish phone companies to block the Uber app while the court examines a case brought by the Madrid Taxi Association last Tuesday.

The court ruled that Uber drivers in Madrid carry out activities that 'constitutes unfair competition', the services said in a statement.

They also accused drivers hired through the app of  'lacking the administrative authorisation to carry out the job.'

The ruling was a 'cautionary measure' adopted while the court examines a case brought by the Madrid Taxi Association, the service said in a statement. 

Last Monday, Dutch judges banned UberPOP, from taking bookings via its smartphone app and threatened the company with fines of up to 100,000 euros ($123,000), saying unlicensed drivers were breaking the law.

A defiant Uber reacted in a statement by saying it 'will continue to offer UberPOP.'  

Also on Monday, the city government in New Delhi  banned Uber from operating in the Indian capital after a passenger accused one of its drivers of rape.

Shiv Kumar Yadav, 32, is expected to be charged with raping the finance company employee on Friday night. He was hired to ferry her home from a dinner engagement.

New Delhi Police said they were considering legal action against Uber for failing to run background checks after it emerged the suspect was arrested for raping a woman three years ago but was later acquitted. 

Authorities in Denmark and Norway have also filed complaints against Uber.

In Germany, a court in Frankfurt threw out an injunction against Uber in September. Uber was able to resume operating legally in Germany pending a final ruling on a complaint by the taxi federation.
