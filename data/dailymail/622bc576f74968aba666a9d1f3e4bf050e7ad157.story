George Clooney has hit back at casino billionaire Steve Wynn, who accused the actor of being 'money coddled' and living in a bubble after the pair had a heated argument.

Refusing to let Wynn's 'version of the truth go unchallenged' Clooney denied he had been drinking heavily on the night in question, and repeated his claim that the billionaire had called President Obama an 'a******'.

The pair reportedly had such a heated argument in in the restaurant of Wynn's Las Vegas restaurant that Clooney was seen to storm out.

Wynn later denied using inappropriate language to describe the president, and put their disagreement down to differing political views and tequila.

But in a statement to People on Friday, Clooney said Wynn had surrounded himself with 'Yes men', and said the casino owner needed to stop making up stories.

'You can't make up stories when eight people who are not on your payroll are sitting around you as witnesses,' the actor said.

He added that not only did Wynn call Obama an 'a******', 'he bellowed "I voted for an a******".'

In an interview with Bloomberg News' Stephanie Ruhle, which was broadcast Friday, Wynn denied calling the President names.

'I didn’t call the President an a****** and George didn't call me an a******. He was a little into the tequila but he is fun to be with. He's a good storyteller,' Wynn said.

'Artists, actors, they live in a very strange bubble of their own. They’re money coddled, they’re highly privileged.

'We're talking about successful artists like George, Barbra Streisand or any other really successful performing artists. They live in a relatively small world, the people around them are very solicitous and caring of them.

'They have a worldview that is therefore- Everything should be given to everybody because everything has been given to them.

If you run a business, if you are responsible for a lot of people you come to grips with the reality that you have to have discipline.'

On the opposite side, Clooney's friend and longtime business partner Randy Gerber said after the bust up that the confrontation was not about politics but about loyalty. 

'This wasn't about politics. It was about George standing up for a friend,' Gerber told TMZ.

'We weren't drunk... no shots were had.'

In the Bloomberg interview, the 72-year-old casino magnate spoke more about his belief that it is the burden of businesspeople to prevent the government from overspending.

'If you run a business, if you are responsible for a lot of people you come to grips with the reality that you have to have discipline,' he said.

On the defense: Steve Wynn said that there wasn't any explicit name calling during his argument with George Clooney but he wasn't surprised that they differed on their political opinions

'You have to protect the enterprise in order to take care of the employees. So therefore, you can’t be wasteful, you can’t squander things or you jeopardize other people. So running a business gives you a sense of compassion that is defined in different terms than someone who just thinks of themselves as generous.'

Wynn told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that Clooney likes his alcohol and 'got drunk' after drinking tequila shots.

'When he's drinking, he considers himself a close personal buddy of the president,' he said.

'Clooney's fun to be with when he's sober. If you have a chance to drink with him, you want to get there early, and don't stay late.

'Everybody who's in my business, the casino business, knows to take actors with a grain of salt.'

Wynn added that Clooney's partners were 'mortified.'

'Steve Wynn and I have met three times, two times for dinner. That is the extent of our knowledge of one another, so I will refrain from trying to categorize him based on the little time we've spent together, but I will not let his version of the truth go unchallenged.'He now says he didn't call the president an "a******". That is false. He bellowed "I voted for the a******', and then called him the same thing several more times as the dinner came to an abrupt end.

'Again there were eight people at the table, eight witnesses. I did in turn, call him the same body part, and walked out. Again he can make up whatever story he wants, but these are the facts.

'He said I drank 16 shots of tequila. I didn't drink one shot of tequila, not one. We were drinking but it was early and we still had two events to attend.

'He said I live in a bubble. More of a bubble than Las Vegas? Honestly? He says I'm "molly coddled", that I'm surrounded by people who coddle me. I would suggest that Mr Wynn look to his left and right and find anyone in his sphere that says anything but "yes" to him.

'Emphatically. I did not attend a private boys' school, I worked in tobacco fields and in stock rooms, and construction sites. I've been broke more of my life than I have been successful, and I understand the meaning of being an employee and how difficult it is to make ends meet.

'Steve is one of the richest men in the world and he should be congratulated for it, but he needs to take off his red sparkly dinner jacket and roll up his sleeves every once in a while and understand what most of the country is actually dealing with ... or at least start with the fact that you can't make up stories when eight people who are not on your payroll are sitting around you as witnesses.'
