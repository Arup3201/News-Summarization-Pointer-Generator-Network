Chelsea star Eden Hazard and Andre Schurrle appear in relaxed form ahead of Sunday's massive game at Old Trafford. 

German midfielder Schurrle posted a selfie of the duo on the team plane en route to Manchester on Saturday evening as Jose Mourinho's side look to continue their unbeaten start to the Premier League season. 

Both players are set to play key roles against Louis van Gaal's men with Schurrle tipped to play centre forward in the absence of injured strikers Diego Costa and Loic Remy.

Belgian star Hazard scored a brace in Chelsea's midweek Champions League rout of Maribor and has been in excellent form for the Blues. 

Mourinho takes his Chelsea side to Old Trafford on Sunday shunning the conservative approach to instead chase a victory over Manchester United.

Mourinho will play against one-time mentor Van Gaal for the second time in competitive matches, bidding to build on the Blues' seven wins in eight Premier League matches so far this season.

Hazard scored twice for Chelsea in their 6-0 rout of Maribor in the Champions League on Monday night 

Last season, just three games into his second spell as Chelsea boss, Mourinho opted against fielding a recognised striker at Old Trafford.

This time Chelsea travel with a win on their minds.

'Try (for) the best result as always,' Mourinho said.

German forward Schurlle could be deployed at centre forward against Manchester United at Old Trafford 

'Try to play as good as we are playing and we are always trying to play, respecting an opponent that is one of the best and most difficult in the Premier League.

'We are confident, we are in a good moment, in a good situation and there is no reason for us to change our feeling.

'We play against a big team, yes, we know that, but we feel ourselves in a very good moment.'

Diego Costa is still unavailable for Chelsea as the Spain striker recovers from hamstring problems 

Mourinho is prepared to risk the fitness of striker Diego Costa, who has scored nine goals in seven Premier League games and is recovering from a hamstring problem and viral infection.

Loic Remy (groin) is out, while midfielders John Obi Mikel (foot) and Ramires (groin) could return alongside forward Andre Schurrle (illness).

Thibaut Courtois is to return in goal after Petr Cech started Tuesday night's match against Maribor and Filipe Luis is likely to play at left-back with Cesar Azpilicueta suspended.

Cesc Fabregas, who was linked with United in recent seasons, has been key to Chelsea's form this term since signing from Barcelona.

But Mourinho is confident his side can adapt if United try to shut down the Spain playmaker, just as Crystal Palace tried last weekend.

The Blues boss added: 'If he doesn't run (the game), somebody runs it. Against Crystal Palace he had individual police and we played without him in the first half when he had that individual policing.

'We are very confident about ourselves. I'm not interested in thinking which team Man United play, who is playing, who is not playing. I'm not interested.

'We are playing well, we are confident, we are top of the league, we are in a good position.

'The camp is happy and we are ready for the game.'
