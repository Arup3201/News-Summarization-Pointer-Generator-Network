A Gary Barlow superfan who has tweeted the star almost 5,000 times in a bid to get him to come to her 50th birthday party and claims she has finally had a reply saying 'see you soon'.

Sue Smith, 49, set up a Twitter account with the sole purpose of making contact with the singer and since April last year has devoted all her spare time to the #getgarytosues50th campaign.

The married childminder says she strategically tweets Gary when he has just written a post so she stands a greater chance of him seeing it - and has now sent him 4,702.

But Mrs Smith did not expect the private message she got on Twitter from Gary this week which said: 'Sue, you're a one off! Love it! See u soon xxx'.

Although he hasn't yet confirmed he will be going to the party Mrs Smith says she is 'optimistic' he is planning to perform for her.

She said: 'I couldn't believe it when I received the private message.

'Okay he hasn't confirmed anything but the fact he's said he'll see me soon leaves me feeling optimistic.

Campaign high: One of her wishes came true when she got a 'follow back' from the Take That singer in October last year

One of her wishes came true when she got a 'follow back' from the Take That singer in October last year - and she has even remembered she was his 706th follower.

A former footballer has launched a campaign to bring Gary Barlow to the Highlands to sing at his wedding.

Chris Finnigan, 28, who played for Caley Thistle, is hoping his Twitter campaign can lure the Take That frontman to perform and surprise his bride-to-be during the service on July 3.

In January, the singer tweeted his promise to perform at the weddings of three fans in 2015.

He wrote: 'In 2015 I want to sing at 3 weddings. The only deal is they have to be HUGE fans and all you have to do is stalk me on here.' 

Now he has followed her she has been able to direct message him - and has sent more than 200 pleas to perform for her.

Mrs Smith's husband Graham, 51, says she is 'obsessed' with Gary and Mrs Smith admits her 21 year-old son Luke is 'embarrassed' by her.

But daughter Lara, 14, travels to Take That concerts with Mrs Smith and has even joined in the campaign, which now has 150 followers on the social media site.

Mrs Smith hopes to meet Gary after a concert in Birmingham on May 16, after the father of one child she was looking after revealed he was tour manager for Take That's drummer Donovan Hepburn.

More than 150 of Mrs Smith's family and friends are invited to the event which will take place at Ely Golf Club, Cambs on July 11, the nearest Saturday to her 50th on July 14.

Dedication: The Barlow superfan had the singer's painted the singer's name on one of her nails and tweeted 'I too am ready for you Gary'

Sue Smith's bid to get her idol Gary Barlow to her 50th birthday could well be successful - the Take That singer has been known to turn up at weddings to surprise superfans.

In May last year, Barlow treated newly married Louise and her husband Mark Francis to a special rendition of her favourite track, A Million Love Songs. 

The blushing bride was filmed sobbing as she started into the singer's eyes in footage that formed part of one-off BBC show When Corden Met Barlow.
