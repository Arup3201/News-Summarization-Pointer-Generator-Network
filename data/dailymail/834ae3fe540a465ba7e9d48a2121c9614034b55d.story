When it came to explaining the birds and the bees - photographer Patrice Laroche decided to do things a bit differently.

During the nine months of his wife Sandra Denis' pregnancy, the couple posed for this hilarious set of pictures to chart their joyous journey to parenthood.

They show Patrice pretending to plug an air pump at a garage into his wife's belly button.

Step One: Find yourself an air pump and attach to your wife's belly button

Step Two: Turn on the power and let the magic begin

Step Three: Things are starting to progress and Sandra is well on her way

As Sandra's belly swells, Patrice cowers in the corner until finally baby Justine explodes into life.

The couple then share a tender moment with their new born wrapped in a leather jacket.

With each picture arranged in exactly the same way - it gives the impression that Sandra's stomach has been filled with air until out pops a baby.

Step four: Patrice is starting to look worried as Sandra appears almost ready to burst

BANG! The journey as reached an explosive conclusion

Those who look carefully might spot a
 few continuity errors that give the game away - such as Patrice's 
sunglasses and the disappearance of snow from the ground.

But otherwise the project - which Patrice has entitled 'How to Make a Baby' - looks utterly convincing.

The unique and clever sequence is not only a great way to celebrate the birth of their child - it's also sure to bring a smile to even the gloomiest of faces. Â 

Good catch: Patrice has to be alert as baby Justine flies into his arms

Happy ending: The couple enjoy a tender moment with their new-born wrapped up in a leather jacket
