BBC and ITV both dipped into the  transfer market to boost their chances of winning the World Cup TV battle this summer, with Thierry Henry, Clarence Seedorf and Fabio Cannavaro signing short-term deals to appear as part of their coverage.

Gary Lineker, England’s top World Cup goalscorer and long-time BBC pundit, tweeted a picture of BBC's 'team' for their first live matches, Spain against Holland on Friday and England versus Italy on Saturday. 'Half decent, I'd say,' was Lineker's verdict - and he's not wrong.

Henry, Rio Ferdinand and Alan Shearer joined Lineker for the selfie, and with Seedorf waiting in the wings for future games the BBC have the makings of quite a five-a-side team over in Brazil.

Hours after Lineker’s tweet, Cannavaro also posted a picture from South America. The former Ballon d’Or winner was joined by Youri Djorkaeff, Luis Figo and Patrick Vieira, the latter of whom will be joining him as part of ITV’s World Cup team.

Which begs the question – who would win in a five-a-side game between the two channels?  

BBC

Thierry Henry – 123 caps, 51 goals

Clarence Seedorf – 87 caps, 21 goals

Rio Ferdinand – 81 caps, 3 goals

Gary Lineker – 80 caps, 48 goals

Alan Shearer – 63 caps, 30 goals

TOTAL – 434 caps, 153 goals

ITV

Fabio Cannavaro – 136 caps, 2 goals

Patrick Vieira – 107 caps, 6 goals

Glenn Hoddle – 53 caps, 8 goals

Ian Wright – 33 caps, 9 goals

Gus Poyet – 26 caps, 3 goals

TOTAL – 355 caps, 28 goals

Neither have an established goalkeeper in their TV coverage squad, so both will be playing 'spider' keepers, where any player on the pitch can swap and go between the sticks.

There is no doubt ITV will miss Roy Keane in midfield – the tantalising prospect of him lining up alongside Vieira snatched away from viewers when the Irishman decided to pursue the assistant manager's job at Aston Villa.

Adrian Chiles must be worried about where his side’s goals are going to come from too, with ITV’s team scoring just 28 goals between them during their international careers, a figure dwarfed by BBC’s tally of 153.

Defensively, however, ITV definitely have the upper hand. Cannavaro and Vieira, World Cup winners with Italy and France respectively, would be formidable in a five-a-side set-up, while Glenn Hoddle and Gus Poyet would be comfortable keeping possession in midfield.

Verdict – Despite ITV’s defensive pedigree it is hard to imagine anything other than a high-scoring BBC victory.
