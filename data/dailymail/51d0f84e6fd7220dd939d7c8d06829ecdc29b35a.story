He walked away from chart toppers One Direction because, in his own words, he wanted to be a regular 22-year-old. 

But on Saturday afternoon Zayn Malik confirmed persistent rumours that he has teamed up with hit producer Naughty Boy during an apparent break at a London recording studio.

The singer, whose first appearance at the studio came just 24-hours after his shock departure from the boy band, was joined by the producer on a studio stairwell, where they idled close to an open window.

So much for the simple life! In a MailOnline picture exclusive, Zayn Malik is seen with hit producer Naughty Boy at a London recording studio on Saturday afternoon

Zayn sported the same denim jacket and skinny jeans he wore for the departure from the London home he shares with fiancée Perrie Edwards earlier that day. 

With his hair tied in a trendy top-knot, the singer chatted with Naughty Boy - real name Shahid Khan -for a few moments before making his way back inside. 

At one point the producer appeared to be talking earnestly with Zayn, one hand pressed to the pop star's chest as they stood face to face.

Much to discuss: The pair evidently had plenty to talk about during their first sighting since Zayn's shock announcement earlier this week 

Walk this way: Pop star Zayn looked glum, making an exit with his head bowed while Naughty Boy followed close behind 

After an emotionally exhausting week that saw  him jet back from South East Asia prior to making his announcement the singer looked completely exhausted. 

Keeping his head bowed and with his eyes partially closed, Zayn seemed in dire need of a good night's sleep during his first appearance with Naughty Boy.

The producer has previously helped transform the careers of hit-makers Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith and Emeli Sande.

Walking away? Speaking to The Sun just six hours after saying that he wanted to be 'out of the spotlight', Zayn confirmed that his plan was to 'Be myself for a bit. Write and relax and chill'

Looking ahead: The singer added that he had never felt more in control in his life and was seen hitting the recording studio in London the very next day

Meanwhile it has emerged that Zayn's new solo material will reportedly be released with Simon Cowell's record label.

Syco, which already owns the rights to distributing One Direction music, is said to have secured an agreement with the former member who had left the band's contract early.

1D were believed to have signed a new £10 million deal in 2013 to produce two more albums and a Greatest Hits, but with Zayn's announcement it seems Simon doesn't want to lose out on his investment. 

An insider told The Sun: 'Simon was very understanding about him leaving the band but quickly made it clear he would stay a Syco artist for his future projects.

'He’ll now be able to make sure any releases are timed so they don’t clash with anything by One Direction. 

Going solo: The singer admitted One Direction were 'no longer real' to him following his departure from the band 

Hit-maker: Should Naught Boy collaborate with Zayn, their music will be distributed by Syco, which already owns the rights to distributing One Direction music

Stairway to heaven: Zayn has wasted no time in visiting the recording studio after returning from the South East Asian leg of One Direction's On The Road Again world tour 

Drama: Zayn's decision to leave the band came after he was signed off the current tour with stress, in the aftermath of cheating rumours that surrounded viral pictures that saw him cuddling up to a young, blonde holidaymaker Lauren Richardson in Thailand last week

'My life with One Direction has been more than I could ever have imagined. 

'But, after five years, I feel like it is now the right time for me to leave the band. I'd like to apologise to the fans if I've let anyone down, but I have to do what feels right in my heart. 

'I am leaving because I want to be a normal 22 year old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight. 

'I know I have four friends for life in Louis, Liam, Harry and Niall. I know they will continue to be the best band in the world.'

Speaking to The Sun just six hours after saying that he wanted to be 'out of the spotlight', Zayn confirmed that his plan was to: 'Be myself for a bit. Write and relax and chill.' 

The singer added that he had never felt more in control in his life and was seen hitting the recording studio in London the very next day. 

Zayn previously claimed that he wanted to spend time being 'normal' but later told the paper's Dan Wootton that he stayed with the band for his following. 

'You know, I did try to do something that I wasn't happy doing for a while, for the sake of maybe other people's happiness,' he said. 'And that was mainly the fans.' 

As part of Wednesday's statement to MailOnline, the band announced that they would make a fifth album as a four-piece and would tour again after Zayn's departure.

Speaking about their future, Zayn confirmed that the boys were in it for the longhaul, adding: 'They still want to do it for a while, so they're going to carry on doing what they want to do.'

Honest: The singer admitted that he had no 'master plan' about becoming a celebrity when he auditioned as a solo artist for the X Factor in 2010

He went on to say that he thought they would 'do ok' without him in the future.

Zayn's decision to leave the band came after he was signed off the current tour with stress, in the aftermath of cheating rumours that surrounded viral pictures that saw him cuddling up to a young, blonde holidaymaker Lauren Richardson in Thailand last week. 

The rumours were said to have rocked his relationship with fiancée of four years Perrie Edwards, but Zayn praised his Little Mix girlfriend in the interview for her consistent support, telling the newspaper that she was 'alright' about his decision and that she was 'a good girl'.

Zayn's confirmation that he will continue with a pop career come after he was quoted as saying that he 'never' wanted to be famous.

Workd to do: The singer was seen making his way to the studio earlier that day 

The 22-year-old singer admitted that he had no 'master plan' about becoming a celebrity when he auditioned as a solo artist for the X Factor in 2010.

In a previously unreleased interview from 2012, when asked if he expected his life to be how it is now, he told Rolling Stone magazine: 'No, not at all. This isn't what I thought I was going to be doing. I just went for the experience.

'I never went with a master plan, thinking, 'I want to be famous.' I literally went for an experience thing on the show and just hoped that... I guess I just got lucky.'

The star also alluded to struggling with the success of the band, admitting he found it 'hard to put into words' how he felt about causing mass hysteria wherever he went.

And even three years ago, Zayn appeared to hint about plans to take more of a back seat in the future.

When asked if he could go back to a normal life ever again, he revealed that he would like to work in the background as a songwriter or producer.
