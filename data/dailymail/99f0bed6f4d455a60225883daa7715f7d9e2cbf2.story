Pressure: Tim Yeo denied breaking Commons rules by discussing a committee appearance with a business client

Senior Tory MP Tim Yeo has quit his chairmanship of the Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee after he was plunged into a sleaze scandal.

In a statement released last night, Mr Yeo said that he would tell committee colleagues that he wanted to ‘temporarily stand aside’ while the Parliamentary standards commissioner investigated him.

The Suffolk South MP was caught by undercover newspaper reporters apparently boasting that he had helped coach an industry contact with whom he had a business connection on how to perform before his committee.

He denies any wrongdoing and insists he rejected reporters’ offers of £7,000 a day fees in exchange for lobbying for them.

Mr Yeo referred himself to the commissioner in an attempt to clear his name.

Today the committee 'unanimously accepted' Mr Yeo's recommendation that he 'absent himself from Committee business for the duration of the investigation of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, following his self-referral at the weekend'.

In a statement it added: 'The Committee expressed confidence in Mr Yeo's chairmanship of the Committee, but accepted the recommendation in order to ensure the continued effective and evidence-based work of the Committee.'

Mr Yeo will not claim his £14,728 salary as a committee chairman while he is being investigated. Lib Dem MP Sir Robert Smith will act as interim chairman.

However, Sir Robert has declared having shares in oil firm Shell and last year received a donation from BP International.

Mr Yeo stepped aside after senior Labour figures piled pressure on him to quit.

Chris Bryant, a Labour home office spokesman, tweeted: ‘How can Tim Yeo possibly remain chair of a committee after [the Sunday Times] story and when he has direct financial interests?’

Mr Yeo’s interests in the green industry are believed to top £1million.

In his statement, Mr Yeo said: ‘I am [standing aside] solely to ensure the smooth running of the Committee during the next few weeks.

‘I firmly believe that I have not breached the MPs’ code of conduct in any respect and therefore await the outcome of the Commissioner’s investigation with confidence.

‘In particular I absolutely and unreservedly deny the allegation that I coached a witness with whom I have a business connection before that person gave evidence to the Committee.

'I do not wish the Commissioner's investigation to be a distraction from the Committee's important work. I believe that during the past three years the committee has been extremely effective and I want this to continue.'

Undercover reporters posed as representatives of a green energy firm looking to hire Mr Yeo and filmed their conversation

Mr Yeo has been under pressure to 
resign from the committee after a newspaper investigation appeared to 
show him claiming he could exert influence behind the scenes for private
companies.

He was filmed
apparently bragging that he had privately coached the director of the 
firm – to which he has financial links – on how to influence the 
committee.

In
reality, he was speaking to undercover reporters posing as 
representatives of a green energy firm looking to hire him on a salary 
of £7,000 a day.

Mr Yeo said he could introduce them 
to ‘really all the key players in the UK Government’, and guide them on 
how to give evidence to his own committee of MPs.

The
MP, who served as an environment minister in John Major’s government, 
has earned about £400,000 from consulting work for various green 
companies.

In the video he appeared to suggest that he had coached a client, John Smith, managing director of GB Rail Freight, on how to influence the committee - a meeting at which he excused himself asking questions because of the conflict of interest.

'I was able to tell him in advance what he should say,' he said.

But Mr Yeo denied any wrong doing earlier today. He told BBC Radio Wales: 'What happened was I travelled with the person concerned in the company of two other people five days before his appearance before the committee in a train.

'During that conversation I spoke very briefly to him about his forthcoming appearance in front of the committee, so I could explain to him that because of the business connection between us - which, of course, was properly declared and registered - I wouldn’t take part in questioning.

'I did not do so, I did not coach John Smith as the paper alleges, he’s not a paying client as the paper alleges, and like many business executives giving evidence to select committees, he actually sought advice from the public affairs company which his company retains for that purpose.'

MPs and campaigners said the footage was ‘damning’ and called for him to stand down.

Westminster has been embroiled in a scandal this week about MPs and peers handing lobbyists more than 200 Parliamentary passes despite mounting concern about their influence

Mr Yeo, whose committee scrutinises 
new energy laws, was recorded at a restaurant by Sunday Times reporters 
posing as representatives of a solar energy firm who asked for his help.

He would have to 
declare such an interest, and was filmed saying he could not speak out 
for them in the House of Commons because ‘people will say he’s saying 
this because of his commercial interest’.

However, he reportedly assured them: ‘What I say to people in private is another matter altogether.’

The MP for South Suffolk has taken various paid roles at green firms since taking over the chairmanship of the committee in 2010.

He also has shares and options worth about £583,000 in low-carbon firms that have employed him. The House of Commons code of conduct prohibits members from acting as paid advocates.

'I intend to contest these allegations very vigorously indeed.'

Tim Yeo MP

He is the latest politician to be 
implicated in the ‘Westminster for sale’ scandal by the Sunday Times. It
was revealed last week that three peers had agreed to ask parliamentary
questions and lobby ministers for paying clients. Lords Mackenzie, 
Cunningham and Laird all deny the claims.

Tory MP Margot James wrote on Twitter that the allegations were ‘damning’.

She said ‘paid consultancy and directorships relevant to committee work surely incompatible with chairing [a] committee’.

Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Tim Yeo appears to have been caught red-handed in a disgusting attempt to bend the rules.

‘Mr Yeo should resign but, more importantly, the Government should reconsider its disastrous energy policies that reward this sort of behaviour.’

Mr Yeo apparently told the reporters he could commit to at least one day a month, despite already holding four private jobs and negotiating to take a further two.

He said: ‘If you want to meet the right people, I can facilitate all those introductions and I can use the knowledge I get from what is quite an active network of connections.’

Mr Yeo has referred himself to the Commons standards commissioner for the allegations to be investigated, and said he ‘totally rejects’ the claims.

He said: ‘The Sunday Times has chosen to quote very selectively from a recording obtained clandestinely during a conversation of nearly an hour and a half in a restaurant with two undercover reporters who purported to be representing a client from South Korea.

My lawyer requested the whole recording from which these extracts were obtained but this has not been given. He said it was ‘totally untrue’ that he had coached Mr Smith.

Labour MP John Mann said: ‘He has referred himself for investigation, clearly he has to stand down while that goes on.'
