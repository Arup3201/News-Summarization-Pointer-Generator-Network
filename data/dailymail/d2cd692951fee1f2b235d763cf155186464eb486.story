The mother of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman has announced that there will be public celebrations of her son's life in both New York City and Rochester this spring.

At a screening of Hoffman's Oscar-winning film Capote in Rochester on Friday, critic Jack Garner read a statement by Marilyn O'Connor thanking fans and friends for their support.

‘It has been a devastating loss for us, but I know that you also feel a great sorrow,’ she said.

The retired judge described her son as ‘a gift’, reports the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle.

‘We miss and cry for the little boy and the man, the brother, the uncle, the husband, the father, the friend... We will also miss his talent, his knowledge of his craft, and seeing results of his hard work. He was a gift to me for 46 years. I wanted more.’

Hoffman grew up just outside Rochester and used to go to watch movies at The Little Theatre, the venue for Friday's screening.

'My heart is broken and will never be the same again, O'Connor said in the statement.

'I know many of you feel the same. We will find our way through this and hear his clear voice and laughter as we do, because he is cheering for all of us to go on, to shine, to be the best that we can be. Thank you all and especially, The Little Theatre, a place Phil loved to go and watch movies.'

O'Connor made her announcement on the same day that it was announced that her son's death was caused by an acute mixed drug intoxication of heroin, cocaine, benzodiazepines and amphetamine.

The Oscar-winning actor, 46, was 
found dead on February 2 in his $10,000-a-month West Village apartment 
surrounded by 70 bags of heroin and 20 used syringes.

Hoffman's
 tragic death came less than a year after he completed a stint in rehab 
for his addiction after being clean for 23 years.

According to the New York medical examiner on Friday, acute mixed drug intoxication was the cause of death.

One of the drugs found in Hoffman's system was benzodiazepine - a psychoactive drug with sedative and muscle relaxant properties that can be used to treat anxiety disorders. 

The other prescription drug found in Hoffman's system amphetamine was an 'upper' - such as  Adderall - and can be used to give an enhanced feeling of wakefulness and focus.

The New York medical examiner announced on Friday that Philip Seymour Hoffman's death was caused by an acute mixed drug overdose of heroin, cocaine, benzodiazepines and amphetamine.

Speedball (also referred to as power-balling)  refers to shooting heroin or morphine in the same syringe. Some also use it with two syringes, one in each arm.

The term can also be applied to use of pharmaceutical opioids - benzodiazepines or barbiturates along with amphetamines.

The cocktail of drugs can cause a strong physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms, and is extremely deadly.

Mixing the heroin and cocaine together
 is known as 'speed-balling' and is the same deadly combination that 
claimed the lives of actors River Phoenix, John Belushi and Chris 
Farley. 

The star 
reportedly fell off the wagon during the wrap party for his 2012 movie 
The Master and entered rehab in May of last year.

The Capote star
 was found at dead at his home early on the Sunday morning by friend 
David Bar Katz when he didn't show to pick up his children.

Police had been investigating his death as a suspected drug overdose.

Investigators
 have determined that Hoffman made six ATM transactions for a total of 
$1,200 inside a supermarket near his home on the Saturday night before his death.

Three
 people were later arrested during the investigation into the source of 
the drugs, including a long-time friend and 'drug dealer' Robert 
Vineberg.

Struggling jazz musician Vineberg, 57, was arrested on February 4 in his apartment in the pricey Nolita district of Manhattan and charged with drug possession after hundreds of bags of heroin were found at his home.

Before his death, Hoffman separated from costume designer 
Marianne 'Mimi' O’Donnell, the mother of his three children, as he battled addiction. 

Hoffman moved into an apartment close to where Ms O'Donnell lives with the children in their $4.2 million apartment.

The actor leaves Ms O'Donnell and their three children - son Cooper, 10, Tallulah, seven, and five-year-old Willa.

The actor, who won an Oscar for Capote and also starred in The Hunger Games, The Master and Moneyball, was considered one of the leading talents of his generation.

He was remembered at a funeral on February 6 for 400 people at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on Manhattan's Upper East Side.

The service at attended by his 
family and close friends in Hollywood including Cate Blanchett, Meryl 
Streep, Ethan Hawke, Amy Adams and Joaquin Phoenix.
