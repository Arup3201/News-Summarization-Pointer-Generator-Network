With a personal fortune worth hundreds of millions of pounds, she was never going to settle for a mundane 70th birthday bash.

So those fortunate enough to receive an invite to Stagecoach co-founder Ann Gloag's party at her castle knew they were in for something very special.

And the businesswoman did not disappoint the 250 guests at her grand soiree.

Stagecoach millionaire: Ann Gloag one of Scotland's richest women, pictured at her former home in Balcraig, near Perth, hosted her 70th birthday in her castle with performances from Lulu and Neil Sedaka

Those lucky enough to attend were 
treated to live performances by legendary singer-songwriter Neil Sedaka 
and veteran Scots pop star Lulu.

Sedaka, 73, sang a selection of his most memorable hits, including 1962 classic Breaking Up Is Hard To Do.

But it was Lulu who opened the evening's entertainment at the lavish event. She was followed by celebrity magician Dynamo.

The black tie party was held at Mrs Gloag's impressive home, Kinfauns Castle, Perthshire, where she has lived since 2004.

Guests arrived to a champagne reception, followed by a threecourse meal served in a marquee erected in the castle's grounds.

The black tie party was held at Mrs Gloag's impressive home, Kinfauns Castle, Perthshire, where she has lived since 2004.

Guests arrived to a champagne reception, followed by a three-course meal served in a marquee erected in the castle's grounds.

The menu included traditional turkey with all the trimmings, as well as sea bass and a trio of desserts.

One guest said: 'It was a superb night and Ann looked stunning. She certainly defied her 70 years.

'She was surrounded by family and friends and she had flown in around 20 staff who work with her African charities.'

Mrs Gloag runs a school in  Nairobi, Kenya, named in honour of her late son, Jonathan who took his own life in 1999, aged 28.

She now devotes a significant amount of her time to her charitable causes, including support for Mercy Ships, which operates the largest non-governmental hospital ship in the world.

Mrs Gloag was awarded an OBE in the 2004 New Year Honours list for her services to charity.

In 2005, Edinburgh Napier University awarded her an honorary doctorate.

Before being overtaken by Harry Potter author JK Rowling, she was the richest woman in Scotland.

Mrs Gloag, a trained nurse, once told how she amassed her wealth by 'fighting for survival'.

She became a unit sister in Bridge of Earn Hospital, Perthshire, where she met her future husband, Robin Gloag, while he was a patient.

By the 1970s, the couple were running a small caravan sales business. But, after 20 years in nursing, Mrs Gloag branched out.

The bus men: Stagecoach Group is an inter-national company operating buses, trains, trams and ferries - and Mrs Gloag serves as a non-executive director

The couple, along with Mrs  Gloag's brother Brian Soutar, who now runs Stagecoach, bought a bus for £425. Their intention was to take the trip of a lifetime to China but the plan failed through visa problems.

Instead, the entrepreneurs were invited by a construction company to provide transport for  workers travelling to building sites.

The brother and sister realised the potential and with their  savings and their father's timely redundancy payment of £25,000, they bought two more buses.

Stagecoach expanded from its limited Perthshire routes to offering cheap tickets between Dundee and London.

The venture took off and Stagecoach Group is now an inter-national company operating buses, trains, trams and ferries. 

Mrs Gloag serves as a non- executive director. Her former husband was killed in a car crash on December 6, 2007.

Last year, Mrs Gloag received the prestigious Eleanor Roosevelt Award in recognition of her charitable work over more than three decades.

The medal honours individuals who carry out the values which former US First Lady Eleanor  Roosevelt espoused in her public life.

Mrs Gloag is a committed Christian and rescued a Kenyan baby, Paul, more than two decades ago and raised him as her own. She once said: 'I've got the view that, regardless of what you do in life, very few of us are remembered.

'I'd like to be remembered as someone who was caring – that, and a great big statue.'
