Bodies started to drop at Franklin’s Gardens but the resolve of the champions ultimately proved too much for Bath as Northampton held on for a dramatic win.

No-one steps up for the Saints more than Dylan Hartley and it was the skipper who emerged from a pile of bodies to deny the West Country side a last-ditch try.

Bath arrived in the Midlands with sharpened claws. Confidence was high after last week’s 45-0 victory over Leicester, but here they met their match as the Saints’ defence galvanised for a bonus point win.

‘It’s not always about scoring loads of tries like we did against Gloucester,’ said Hartley. ‘It’s about defending like we did today. I’m really proud of the guys.’

Saints had to face the league’s in-form side without Tom Wood and Courtney Lawes, who were late injury withdrawals for the hosts.

The pair would have been watched closely by England coaches Andy Farrell and Graham Rowntree, who were in the stands for the sell-out match, but there was still no shortage of duels to drool over.

Bath won a penalty at the opening scrum after England prop Alex Corbisiero, perhaps harshly, was penalised as he packed down against international team-mate David Wilson. But Saints quickly settled into their rhythm and, after a kick from George Ford, Ben Foden scythed through the Bath defence, before Luke Arscott slapped down a Kahn Fotuali’i try to gift the hosts a penalty try. The Bath full-back was sin-binned for his troubles and Stephen Myler converted. 

Calum Clarke doubled the lead after 15 minutes. George Pisi had defenders swinging from his ankles as he burst through the middle, before Luther Burrell’s floated pass sent his team-mate over in the corner. Myler again converted.

Bath did not give up hope. With Arscott back on the pitch, Ford began to orchestrate his side’s attack and, not before confirmation from the TMO, the England playmaker sent Wilson over with an inside pass.

Ford converted and then exchanged a penalty with Myler, before the Saints No10 missed an attempt on goal to leave the visitors trailing by seven points at the break. 

‘We’ve sometimes blown teams away in the first 20 minutes, but it turned around today,’ said Bath head coach Mike Ford. ‘Arscott was in the bin after 14 minutes and 14 points down after 15 minutes it is a tough place to come back from. Going in at 17-10, I thought we could do some damage.’

Foden continued to impress as he set up Christian Day for Northampton’s third try after 49 minutes.

Jon Fisher made the hard yards, before Foden set up Day. The momentum continued as the bonus point was secured four minutes later. Ford’s kick went into Northampton hands and the hosts countered.

The ball was spun from right to left before Burrell and North combined, allowing Pisi to power through two tackles for a try. Bath sent on Gavin Henson and he sent over Olly Woodburn, before Nick Auterac touched down off the back of a driving maul to narrow the deficit.

But the late push came to nothing, as Hartley rallied his troops.
