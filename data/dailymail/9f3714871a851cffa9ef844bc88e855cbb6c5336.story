Armed robber Andrew Moran agreed to be extradited back to Britain today, two days after he was dramatically snared after four years on the run while sunbathing with his girlfriend at a Spanish villa.

The fugitive, arrested last Friday on the Costa Blanca as he sunbathed by the swimming pool of his rented villa, said he was happy to be sent back to the UK.

As the hearing took place, police revealed today he kept two guns in a water meter by his garden fence - and slept with a 5ft machete under his bed.

Moran was caught and handcuffed by Spanish officers after trying to escape from his back garden

Moran's arrest was carried out by elite police from Spain's Special Group of Operations, who protect VIPs as well as deal with terrorist attacks

Dramatic footage, released yesterday, showed Spanish detectives nab Moran, 31, 
after crawling into the grounds of his sunshine villa in Calpe near 
Alicante on their hands and knees and racing after him as he tried to 
escape by jumping over a bush.

Today, armed police escorted him to Madrid's Central Criminal Court as he was driven into an underground car park and led into the court building in handcuffs.

The extradition hearing was closed to the press and public.

Last night Moran, part of an armed 
gang that held up a Royal Mail van in Colne, Lancashire, in 2005, was 
remanded in a local jail as the Spanish authoritiies considered his 
future.

A court source said Moran also had a case against him outstanding in Alicante, the province he was arrested in on Friday.

The extradition judge has to decide 
tomorrow whether to send him back to Alicante or authorise 
first his forced return to Britain.

Guns, cartridges and several mobile phones were seized from his home

It is not known what the outstanding court case relates to.

A spokesman for Spain's Central 
Criminal Court, where all extradition hearings take place, said: 'The 
British fugitive arrested on the Costa Blanca appeared in court this 
morning.

'The hearing was closed to the press and public and lasted around 10 minutes.

'He was asked if he opposed extradition and said he didn't.

'He was remanded to a local jail.'

A court source added: 'It appears Moran has an outstanding case against him in a court in Alicante.

'Extradition for someone who agrees to be sent back is very quick and takes place within days.

'But the judge in this case must 
decide whether he sends Moran back to Alicante to be dealt with first or
if he sends him back to the UK first.

'I haven't information on what the court case in Alicante relates to.

Moran had been involved in a gang who threatened
a security guard with a gun and machete outside an ASDA supermarket in 
Colne, Lancashire. They stole £25,000

Moran escaped capture in Spain last November, when he drove up wrong 
side of motorway to flee officers. It is not known how long Moran has 
been living abroad

'The decision on Moran's immediate future will be taken tomorrow once the judge has more information at his disposal.'

He was named on a most wanted 
Crimestoppers list in 2011 after assaulting four security guards and 
fleeing from the dock during his trial at Burnley Crown Court in 2009.

He narrowly avoided capture near 
Murcia, south east Spain, last November after driving the wrong way up a
motorway to flee police.

He rammed two police cars before his 
kamikaze escape up the wrong way of the busy AP7 motorway which runs 
along the Mediterranean coast.

During his time on the run he used aliases and changed his appearance to escape arrest.

Matt Burton, head of investigations 
for Britain's Serious Organised Crime Agency which helped track Moran 
down, said: 'He thought he could evade capture but he has discovered 
there's no hiding place.'

Moran was taken to Madrid after his capture for an extradition hearing at Spain's Central Criminal Court
