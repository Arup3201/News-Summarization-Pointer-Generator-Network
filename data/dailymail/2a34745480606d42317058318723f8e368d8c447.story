Inter Milan have sacked head coach Walter Mazzarri, with Roberto Mancini signing a two-and-a-half-year deal to take over at the San Siro.

The Serie A giants are languishing in ninth place in the table after a summer of heavy spending, bringing in Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic among others. 

 Mancini returns to the club he won the title in three consecutive years between 2005 and 2008.
