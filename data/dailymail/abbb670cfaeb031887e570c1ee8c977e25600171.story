David Cameron could be forced to resign as Prime Minister if Scotland votes to leave the UK, a senior Conservative MP has warned.

Former Tory leadership contender David Davis said a Yes vote in next month’s referendum would be such a ‘humiliation’, he would have to consider stepping down.

Mr Cameron has insisted he has no intention of quitting, even if he presides over the end of the 300-year-old union.

But asked if the Prime Minister would have to go, Mr Davis told the BBC: ‘That’s his call. It will be particularly humiliating for him.

‘It would be a humiliating point for any prime minister to have lost a part of the United Kingdom, no doubt about that.’

John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, added: ‘A Yes vote would destroy Cameron’s place in the history books.

‘He would become known as the prime minister who gambled on keeping Scotland in the union and lost his gamble.

‘[It would be] very difficult in those circumstances to see how he could continue for any very great length of time.’

Mr Davis, who stood against Mr Cameron for the party leadership in 2005, said if Scotland votes to remain in the UK and gets more devolved powers there would be a knock-on effect for England.

He said there would have to be a ‘more federal answer for the United Kingdom’ and this would mean ‘at the absolute minimum, English votes for English measures’.

Mr Cameron has denied his position would be untenable if Scotland voted to leave the UK in the vote on September 18.

Earlier this year when asked if he would resign in the event of a Yes vote, Mr Cameron said: ‘No and I think it is very important people understand that because it is not my name or anyone else’s name on the ballot paper.’

‘Of course, I want to see Scotland stay in the United Kingdom but I faced a choice in 2011 when the Scottish nationalists were elected to run the Scottish government.

‘Do you have a referendum or do you have some massive fight with them saying “no, no you can’t possibly have this choice”?

‘I thought the right thing to do, and this was backed by the other parties at the time, and I remain of the view it was the right thing to do, was to give the Scottish people a fair, legal and decisive referendum. That’s what will happen.

‘It was absolutely the right decision. 
You have to decide the prior question as it were - does Scotland  want 
to stay in the United Kingdom or separate itself from the United 
Kingdom?

‘Once you have settled that question, then you can properly engage with future acts of devolution - on which again I have a pretty good track record.’

The BBC last night claimed that four financial institutions in Scotland have privately raised fears of ‘deposit flight’ if Scotland becomes independent.

But Mr Salmond told the broadcaster the Westminster government is behaving ‘irresponsibly’.

He said: ‘The fear of deposit of flight is caused by a denomination risk - that is to say you would use a currency other than sterling. What we’ve been saying is exactly to prevent the fear of deposit flight.

‘The Westminster parties cannot stop Scotland using the pound.’
