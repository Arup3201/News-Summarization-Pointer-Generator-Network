The German sense of humour has a reputation for backfiring.

And it nearly did in this case - in spectacular fashion.

Pranksters in Germany came within inches of getting badly burnt after a massive firework blew up in their faces.

Scroll down for video

In the video, this man was seen laying his firework bomb somewhere in Germany

The firework, laid on a crossroads, went off with a small bang and a flash of flame at first. But then...

Boom! A second blast goes off seconds after the first - but this one is much much bigger

Footage of the incident posted online on January 14 shows a young man placing the mammoth rocket in the middle of the road moments before a car passes.

He lights it and dashes off to the side as his friends yell and also run for safety.

The firework lets off a small flash and bang as the man filming slows his retreat, seemingly thinking the danger is over.

A fraction of a second later the mega rocket explodes fully, sending sparks shooting out sideways and surrounding the man filming with a blaze of light and smoke.

All of the men escaped unscathed and can be heard beginning to laugh and sing as the smoke clears.

The enormous flash of flame spread through the street, inches away from the pranksters
