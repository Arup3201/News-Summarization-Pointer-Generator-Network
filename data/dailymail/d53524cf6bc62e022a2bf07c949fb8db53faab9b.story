A robot widely used in keyhole surgery is being investigated over concerns about its safety.

The da Vinci, used to treat cancer and other prostate problems, has been credited with reducing the side-effects of surgery.

But it is now being investigated over reports of problems, including several deaths that may be 
linked with it.

There also have been several disturbing,
freak incidents: a robotic hand that wouldn't let go of tissue grasped 
during surgery and a robotic arm hitting a patient in the face as she 
lay on the operating table.

The widely-used da Vinci robot is under scrutiny by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration over reports of problems, including several deaths that may be linked with it

The da Vinci has four spider‑like 
arms, controlled by the surgeon, which hold cutting instruments to make 
tiny incisions and remove the prostate or the cancerous part using 
images from the telescope to guide the surgeon.

It also features a tiny telescope which is placed inside an incision in the patient’s body.

The telescope takes images from two points, which are relayed back to a console so the surgeon has a 3D image on-screen while he operates.

Previous evidence has shown that using these robots mean significantly less blood loss, reduced risk of blood transfusion and probably a shorter overall recovery time. 

For surgeons, who control the robot 
while sitting at a computer screen rather than standing over the 
patient, these operations can be less tiring - and robotic hands don't shake.

A 2002 study in the journal European Urology found prostate cancer surgery done by da Vinci robots had better outcomes for continence and cancer control than keyhole approaches done by the human hand.

The robot is also now used for heart bypass surgery, heart valve repair and hysterectomy.

But an upcoming research paper suggests that problems linked with robotic surgery are underreported, with some American doctors saying there is not enough robust research showing that robotic surgery is at least as good or better than conventional surgeries.

Previous evidence has shown that using these robots, rather than surgeon's hands,results in less blood loss, reduced risk of blood transfusion and a shorter overall recovery time

There are also cases of 'catastrophic complications', said Dr Martin Makary, a Johns Hopkins University surgeon who co-authored the paper. 

'The rapid adoption of robotic surgery ... has been done by and large without the proper evaluation,' he told Associated Press. 

Now the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is looking into a spike in reported problems during robotic surgeries.

Earlier this year, the FDA began a survey of surgeons using the robotic system. The agency conducts such surveys of devices routinely, but FDA spokeswoman Synim Rivers told Associated Press that the reason for the most recent investigation 'is the increase in number of reports received' about da Vinci. 

However, she added that the increase may simply reflect more awareness among doctors and hospitals about the need to report problems.

It may also reflect wider use. Last year there were 367,000 robot surgeries in the U.S. versus 114,000 in 2008, according to da Vinci's maker, Intuitive Surgical Inc. of Sunnyvale, California. 

A search for the company's name in an FDA database of reported problems related to medical devices brings up 500 reports since January 1st, 2012. Many of these are said to have come from Intuitive Surgical.

There's also no proof any of the problems were caused by the robot, and many didn't injure patients.

Reports filed this year include a woman who died during a 2012 hysterectomy when the surgeon-controlled robot accidentally nicked a blood vessel, a Chicago man who died in 2007 after spleen surgery and a robotic arm that wouldn't let go of tissue grasped during colorectal surgery.

'We had to do a total system shutdown to get the grasper to open its jaws,' said the report filed by the hospital. The report said the patient was not injured.

Complications can occur with any type of surgery, and so far it's unclear if they are more common in robotic operations, but that's part of what the FDA is trying to find out. 

Intuitive Surgical disputes there's been a true increase in problems and says the rise reflects a change it made last year in the way it reports problems. 

The da Vinci system 'has an excellent safety record with over 1.5 million surgeries performed globally, and total adverse event rates have remained low and in line with historical trends,' said company spokeswoman Angela Wonson.
