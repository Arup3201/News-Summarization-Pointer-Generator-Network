An elderly man died after he was knocked down by revolving doors at hospital, an inquest heard.

Roderick Elliott, 73, was leaving a check up at the clinic after suffering two strokes when he was hit by the entrance.

The pensioner was left with a broken thigh bone and died in the same hospital six days later.

Tragic: Roderick Elliott, 73, was struck down by this door at South Tyneside District Hospital as he left a check up after suffering two strokes. He suffered a broken thigh bone and died six days later

Incredibly, an inquest revealed he was the second victim to suffer injuries inflicted by the door at South Tyneside District Hospital.

Mr Elliott relied on a walking stick after suffering a stroke in 2001 and another in 2006, his widow Jean told the court.

She said they were making their way to the exit after an appointment on October 21, 2011, when her husband was struck and sent flying.

He was taken into the accident and emergency department and an X-ray revealed he had broken his right femur.

Doctors claimed we was on the way to recovery after having a screw fitted into his hip joint the next day.

However, days after the operation Mr 
Elliott was taken to the toilet in a wheelchair and when staff went back
 to collect him 10 minutes later they found him unresponsive.

Stroke unit: He had been at an appointment at the stroke unit with his wife Jean. He died six days later

The inquest was told the cause of death was acute bronchial pneumonia - a common development in patients laid up with an injury. He also had an underlying heart and lung condition.

Questioning the safety of the door, assistant coroner David Mitford found another patient was struck by it just months before.

Mary Adamson, a Sister in the hospitals outpatients unit, told the inquest a report was filed following  a similar incident in May 2011.

After hearing about the accident, she decided to stand in the door to test if it would hit her, as sensors should have stopped it, she told the court.

She said: 'I stood where I thought Mr Elliott would have been stood and the door did hit me. It didn’t knock me over but it struck me with more force than I thought it would.'

Health and safety manager, Derek Gifford, told the coroner that 2011 had seen 11 accidents similar to this reported across the country, followed by 19 in 2012 and 15 in 2013.

He added that there are 120 like it in the UK and if each one had 500 users each day, 22 million people would use the doors each year, meaning that the incident was 'very rare'.

Assistant coroner, David Mitford, ruled the death had been an accident but added that he was concerned about the doors used in 15 hospitals.

Steve Jamieson, South Tyneside NHS Foundation Trust’s director of corporate services, said: 'We once again extend our deepest sympathies to Mr Elliott’s family on their sad loss.

'The safety of our patients, visitors and staff is always our first consideration and, following the inquest, we now await the coroner’s letter before making any further decision regarding the doors.

'In the meantime, they will remain in slide mode.

'The coroner did note, however, that the doors at the hospital were operating in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommended standards at the time of the tragic incident.'
