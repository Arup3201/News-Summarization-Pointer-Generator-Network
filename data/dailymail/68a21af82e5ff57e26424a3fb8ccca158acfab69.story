For a favourite toy, some dogs will do anything. 

Diving head first into a swimming pool, these animals don't let a bit of water keep them from their balls and chew figures.

The steely determination of the petshave been captured by underwater portrait and dog photographer Jonny Simpson-Lee.

Mr Simpson-Lee said the determination and expression of the dogs shows their primeval hunting instinct 

The 42-year-old, of Pulborough, West Sussex, decided to combine his love of dogs with his passion for underwater photography and place himself at the bottom of a hydrotherapy pool, alongside some treasured dog toys. 

'Freezing the moment a dog breaks through the surface of the water in pursuit of a toy or treat often captures it's primeval hunting instinct and is exaggerated by the way its body takes on fascinating forms within the water,' said Mr Simpson-Lee. 

Mr Simpson-Lee started photographing dogs when he launched a new business that was meant to capture babies swimming underwater. 

He said: 'I found it impossible to persuade anyone to allow me to put a dog in their pool for me to photograph until a chance meeting in a shop with a canine hydrotherapist allowed my dream to become a reality.

'I suggested we gather some dogs who were keen swimmers and produce a calendar of underwater dogs, we only had a couple of weeks to organise the shoot, but it was a great success.'

After the canine calendar the success continued and Mr Simpson-Lee joined forces with House of Hugo, a hotel and training facility for dogs in Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex. The hotel's hydrotherapy pool provided the perfect location to photograph pets underwater.

Mr Simpson-Lee said he enjoyed capturing the movement and expressions of the dogs as they dived

The animals have been pictured jumping into a swimming pool - very different from lakes and the sea 

He added: 'It's difficult to predict the exact spot a dog will enter the water so I target my camera on a toy floating on the surface whilst the owner or assistant keeps the dog from jumping in.

'Once I'm ready and happy the dog is focused on its toy, I call for the dog to be released.

'The process is repeated several times to allow for me to achieve a variety of perspectives.

'One of the most rewarding aspects of my work is to observe the amazing reactions my pictures evoke, especially from a client seeing their own dog captured in this unusual perspective.

Dogs seemed excited and determined to capture their favourite toys, however far they sunk in the water 

Some dogs surprise their owners by teetering on the edge of swimming pools while others go straight in

'Although people find my pictures compelling, a handful of people have said they find some of my photos "scary.'''

Mr Simpson-Lee said one of the key problems he faces is dogs that will not take part, looking gingerly over the edge of the water instead. 

He added: 'Often an owner will come to me believing their dog will dive straight in as it loves swimming in the sea, rivers or ponds.

'However, a swimming pool can be an alien environment for many dogs as the water is clear and smells very different.'
