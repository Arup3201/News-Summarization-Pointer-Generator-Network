Police are still searching for her 22-year-old boyfriend Charlie Martin.

Daniel's daughter Andrica Daniel, 17, 
said she asked her mother and Martin to watch her son, 
Jay'von Daniel, while she took a shower on Saturday.

She told WGCL-TV that she knew something was wrong when she got out because the boyfriend was looking for his crack cocaine.

She took the child to the nearby Piedmont Newnan Hospital. He tested positive for cocaine and was transferred to  Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston.

He was discharged on Monday.

Andrica and Jay'von had been staying at Daniel for about a week when the incident happened.

A police search of Daniel's house was carried out on Saturday evening.

Spokesman Sgt Lee Gragg confirmed officers found evidence at the property but declined to reveal what that is.

Sgt Gragg said: 'The only thing I can say is the witnesses stated the crack was open in the room.'

Police are awaiting toxicology results to determine the amount of cocaine the toddler ingested, he added.
