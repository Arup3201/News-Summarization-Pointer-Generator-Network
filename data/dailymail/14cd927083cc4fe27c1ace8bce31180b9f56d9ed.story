They may be political rivals, but Nicola Sturgeon and the leader of the Scottish Labour party looked like two amigos as they donned sombreros for the 50th anniversary of an aid charity.

Scotland's First Minister and opposition leader Jim Murphy giggled as they posed with Mexican hats and guitars at a mass to celebrate the work done by the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund.

Music from Latin America, African drummers and an Indian choir marked the occasion at St Columbkille's Roman Catholic Church in Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire.

The charity, which supports nearly 100 projects in 15 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, has given more than £63million to help improve the lives of vulnerable people.

Ms Sturgeon, the leader of the SNP, said: 'Scotland can be proud that we have a fantastic international aid charity in SCIAF which helps millions of people to recover from natural disasters and war - and work their way out of poverty in the long term.

'From a small classroom in Rutherglen in 1965, it has become a significant force for good in the world, giving practical help like seeds and farm tools so people can grow food and support themselves.

'It also provides a clear beacon of hope for many in their darkest hour when disasters strike such as the current Ebola epidemic and Syrian refugee crisis.

'I'm delighted to have been able to attend this 50th anniversary Mass and join with parishioners and SCIAF volunteers and staff and wish the charity the very best for the next 50 years.'

A procession of flags from countries the charity has worked in opened the Mass which was led by Bishops Joseph Toal, Peter Moran and Archbishop Leo Cushley.

Mr Murphy said: 'SCIAF is a remarkable Scottish success story. For generations of Scots Catholics and many others, SCIAF has always been a big part of our lives.

'It's a good example of putting the Catholic Church's social teaching into often life-saving practice.

'SCIAF has changed and saved so many thousands of lives but the world remains an unfair place and the need for their work is as necessary now as it was five decades ago.

'I want to congratulate SCIAF on 50 years of dedication and hope that we can build a society free of inequality.'

SCIAF's Director Alistair Dutton said: 'Thanks to the passion, commitment and support of the Scottish public to SCIAF over the last 50 years, millions of people have a much better chance in life and greater hope for the future.

'It's great to return to our roots at St Columbkille's in Rutherglen where our work first began in 1965.'
