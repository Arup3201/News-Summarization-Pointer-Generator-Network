Roberto Soldado scored his first Premier League goal since March and Harry Kane was again excellent for Tottenham as they beat Everton 2-1 at White Hart Lane. 

Kevin Mirallas scored the game's best goal while Kane was the man of the match. Find out how the other players got on with Sportsmail's player ratings. 

TOTTENHAM

Hugo Lloris - 6.5

Helpless for the opening goal but made a good save from Romelu Lukaku early in the first half and was quick off his line to deny the Belgian after a weak Vlad Chiriches back pass.

Vlad Chiriches ( 70' Dier) - 4.5

Gave away the free-kick that led to the opening goal and looked unsure when Leighton Baines attacked, even more so when he was joined by Kevin Mirallas. His weak pass-back almost led to a one-on-one for Lukaku in the first half.

Federico Fazio - 6

Looked more assured after some nervy performances in recent weeks. He's still not the finished article but supporters should be encouraged.  

Jan Vertonghen - 6.5

If Mauricio Pochettino was hoping the defender's time out of the side would make him hungrier, it seems to have worked. Snapped into tackles and organised the defence well when they came under late pressure.

Ben Davies - 6.5

Appeared to have a quiet game but the lack of chances created by Everton down his flank was evidence of a decent showing.  

Ryan Mason - 7

Excellent performance - tenacious in the centre of the park and provided the basis for his side's attacking moves. His partnership with Bentaleb looks really promising. 

Nabil Bentaleb - 6.5

Strong and assured in central midfield again. Combined well with Mason to consistently force Everton out to the wings. 

Christian Eriksen - 7.5

Another excellent performance from the Dane. Scored the equaliser and combined brilliantly with Tottenham's forwards throughout.

Aaron Lennon ( 61' Lamela) - 6.5

Worked really hard defensively against the double threat of Baines and Mirallas, never really got a chance to use his pace going forward but provided the assist for Soldado's goal.

Harry Kane - 8.5

Once again proved himself to be Tottenham's most effective forward. Decent run and shot led to Eriksen's goal and dispossessed a ponderous Barry in the build up to the second. 

Roberto Soldado ( 81' Paulinho) - 7

Pochettino recently revealed he had designed special training exercises for Soldado to help boost the Spaniard's confidence, they seem to have worked. Could have done more to prevent Mirallas' shot for the first goal but more than made up for it with a brilliantly taken chance just before half time. 

Manager: 

Mauricio Pochettino - 7.5

The Argentine manager will be delighted with the way his side played but he has to take considerable credit himself. Tottenham's midfield dominated the game throughout and his training methods appears to have finally got through to Soldado.

EVERTON

Tim Howard - 5

Should have done better for Spurs' opening goal - his weak save from Kane's equally weak shot proved costly as the ball fell into Eriksen's path.

Seamus Coleman - 6.5

Decent going forward and his pace saved Everton shortly after the break when Jagielka misjudged the flight of long pass. Everton's best defender on the night. 

Sylvin Distin was dragged out of position for Tottenham's opening goal and looked exposed in the first half

Phil Jagielka - 5.5

Had his hands full with Kane and Soldado and didn't always impress, the poor performances of those in front of him left him exposed but some of his decision making was also questionable. 

Sylvin Distin - 5

Dragged out of position for Spurs' opening goal and looked as though he needed more support from Everton's midfielders.

Leighton Baines - 6

Solid at the back and got forward well in the first half but as the game wore on he found his chances limited.

Muhamed Besic struggled to get to grips with Tottenham's midfield and almost gave away a late penalty

Muhamed Besic - 4

Second best against Tottenham's central midfielders for much of the game, struggled to deal with Kane and Eriksen. Only settled into the game when the hosts sat back in the second half and could have given way a late penalty.

Gareth Barry - 5

Like Besic, struggled against Tottenham's midfield. Partially at fault for Spurs' second goal after he was dispossessed by Kane in the build up. This performance demonstrated how important James McCarthy is for Barry.

Ross Barkley - 6.5

Promising performance for Everton fans, some of his first half play was reminiscent of his form last season. His influenced waned sightly in the second half but he still looked the most likely source for an Everton equaliser.

Kevin Mirallas ( 61' McGeady) - 6.5

Showed great endeavour to win the free kick that he eventually scored from. What a goal it was, too.

Samuel Eto'o (61' Osman) - 5

Didn't seem quite sure of his role and failed to influence the game in any meaningful way. Everton fans may wonder why he started ahead of Leon Osman against a strong Spurs midfield. 

Romelu Lukaku - 5.5 

Missed a good chance early in the first half struggled to have any real impact on the match. To be fair to the former Chelsea man he was completely isolated for much of the game. 

Manager: 

Roberto Martinez - 6

Not an embarrassing performance by any stretch of the imagination but there was far too much sideways passing from the visitors and a number of Everton's forwards looked unsure of their roles in the first half. 

Referee:

Michael Oliver - 7

Both sides had penalty claims turned down, stayed out of the limelight and allowed the game to flow whenever possible.
