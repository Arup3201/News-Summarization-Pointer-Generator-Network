The body of a young man was found today at the house where double-murder suspect Stephen Farrow was arrested.

As Farrow appeared in court today charged with the murder of a retired teacher and a vicar, police discovered the corpse at the home in Folkestone, Kent.

Sources said it was the same property 
where Farrow was detained on Sunday following a tip-off from the public 
after Avon and Somerset Police had launched a nationwide manhunt.

The dead man was identified locally as 16-year-old Keegan Wilkes, who had lived at the house with his mum and three elder brothers.

Farrow, 47, of no fixed address, was remanded in custody yesterday at North Avon Magistrates’ Court in Yate, south Gloucestershire, charged with the murders of vicar John Suddards and retired teacher Betty Yates.

He will appear before Bristol Crown Court today for a bail application.

Stephen Farrow was remanded in custody today charged with two murders

Mr Suddards, 59, was found stabbed to 
death at his home in Thornbury, South Gloucestershire, on February 14, 
while Mrs Yates, 77, was also knifed to death at her cottage in Bewdley,
Worcestershire, on January 2.

He also faces a charge of burglary relating to a separate property in Thornbury, south Gloucestershire, between December 21 and January 3.

During the hearing, Farrow spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and that he was of no fixed address.

Police said the death of the man at the house in Black Bull Road, Folkestone, Kent, was being treated as non-suspicious and a post-mortem examination is to be held.

The discovery of the corpse is not believed to be linked to the earlier deaths. One source said that it is believed to be drugs-related.

A Kent Police spokeswoman said: 'We were called at 8.35am following the discovery of a young man's body at the house.

'Officers have been at the address this morning. The death is being treated as non-suspicious.'

Farrow appeared before District Judge Joti Boparai surrounded by three female dock officers.

The 6ft 4in suspect was wearing a dark grey fleece jacket and green combat trousers.

The court heard that Farrow was alleged to have burgled a cottage in Thornbury, stealing cash, jewellery, a radio and other items of unknown value.

Prosecutor Sian Sullivan said Farrow’s case was only suitable for trial at crown court.

'I ask that you send those two charges to the crown court and that you also send the burglary as it is related to the offences,' she said.

'They are linked forensically and also by other matters to the defendant.'

Farrow was represented in court by Hannah Uglow, who made no representations on her client’s behalf.

The district judge fixed the bail hearing for tomorrow and the preliminary hearing for March 9.

She said: 'The two charges of murder 
you face can only be tried at the crown court. I am sending your case to
Bristol Crown Court. The burglary matter, as it is linked, will also go
to the same court.

'Your next court appearance will be 
at Bristol tomorrow when the court can consider bail, should you wish to
apply for it tomorrow.

'As far as bail is concerned, I remand you into custody.'

After the tip-off that led police to Farrow, Detective Chief Inspector Simon Crisp said: 'Once again it has been the 
contribution of a member of the public that has made the difference - my
thanks go to that person for their courage in providing us with that 
vital information.'

Detective Chief Inspector Neil 
Jamieson, of West Mercia Police, said: 'I would also like to express my 
gratitude to those members of the public who have helped us and 
responded to our appeals and I would also still encourage people to come
forward and talk to us if they have information which could assist our 
inquiry.

'We still have a 
strong police presence in Bewdley and hope this will help reassure 
people that the area, and indeed the whole of the West Mercia, remains a
very safe place in which to live, work and visit.'

The community of Thornbury was left shattered by the death of Mr Suddards earlier this month

Sian Sullivan, CPS Senior District 
Crown Prosecutor for Avon and Somerset, said: 'Having reviewed this case
in line with the Code for Crown Prosecutors, I have today decided that 
there is sufficient evidence to charge Stephen Farrow with the murders 
of Betty Yates and John Suddards.

'I have also authorised a charge of burglary at a separate address in Thornbury.

'I
would like to remind all concerned that Stephen Farrow now stands 
charged with criminal offences and has the right to a fair trial.

'It is very important that nothing is said, or reported, which could prejudice a trial.'

Mr Suddards' body was found by workmen who had arrived at the vicarage next to St Mary's Church in Castle Street.

The
news of Mr Suddards' death sent shockwaves through the clergy and the 
close-knit community, which lies about 11 miles north of Bristol.

He had only taken up his post last July, having come from the diocese of Chelmsford in Essex.

The
former barrister moved to the area after serving at St Nicolas Church 
in Witham, Essex, since 2001 and before that at Great Yeldham parish, 20
miles away in Essex.

Police seized a white Citroen van at 
about 11.30pm on Tuesday, just hours after arresting a 43-year-old man 
over Mr Suddards' death. He was later released on bail.

It is believed a man in his 40s had been sleeping in the van.

Mrs
Yates was found dead at the bottom of stairs at her home on the banks 
of the River Severn on January 4, having been killed two days earlier.

West
Mercia officers investigating Mrs Yates' killing arrested and 
questioned a man on February 2 before he was released on bail.

After her death, Mrs Yates' son and daughter made an emotional appeal for help to bring their mother's killer to justice.

Hazel Costello, along with her brother David Yates, said: 'We are completely bewildered as to who could carry out such a savage attack on our mother.

'That this should have happened in her home makes this even more difficult to bear.'
