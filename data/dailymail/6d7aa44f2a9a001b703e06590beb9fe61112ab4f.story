Samoa's players are planning a black-armband protest during Saturday’s clash with England after being warned they could be thrown out of next year’s World Cup and the 2016 Olympics for boycotting the match.

Senior players wrote to the International Rugby Board last month threatening to go on strike in protest at a lack of financial transparency within Samoa’s rugby union, whose chairman Tuilaepa Sailele - also the country’s prime minister - labelled them ‘little children’.

The strike appears to have been averted following intervention by the IRB.

It's not just the Samoans who earn far less per game than England - South Africa, New Zealand and Australia all do, too.

England - £18,000*

South Africa £6,700*

New Zealand £5,900*

Australia £5,600*

Samoa £505*

But it emerged on Tuesday that Samoa’s players were told they would suffer serious consequences if they went ahead with the strike, including potentially losing a lucrative Test against the All Blacks in Apia next July.

This left the tourists planning an alternative protest on Saturday against the governance of their sport.

Samoa’s Toulose prop Census Johnston said: ‘We’re voicing our concerns. I’ve seen people saying it’s just about money for us but it isn’t.’

They are paid just NZ$1,000 (£505) per match while on tour in the UK. England players earn £18,000 per match before win bonuses.

Prime minister Tuilaepa Sa'ilele Malielegaoi has angered players by accusing them of 'childish behaviour'

Tourists have ruled out the possibility of strike action as their European tour comes to an end
