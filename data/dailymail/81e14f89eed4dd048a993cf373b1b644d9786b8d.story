Killer: Marcel Arava, 49, had already ‘illegally’ slipped into the UK when he was convicted in his absence and handed 12 years’ jail time for murder by a Romanian court in 2002

A Romanian killer entered Britain ‘unlawfully’ and stayed for more than a decade while he should have been serving a jail term in his homeland, a court heard yesterday.

Marcel Arava, 49, had already ‘illegally’ slipped into the UK when he was convicted in his absence and handed 12 years’ jail time for murder by a Romanian court in 2002.

Despite his claim for asylum being refused, Arava remained in Britain and raised a family before he was arrested outside his south London home in June. 

The case will heighten calls for tighter immigration controls on European Union offenders settling in Britain, sparked when convicted Latvian murderer Arnis Zalkalns was named as prime suspect in the killing of London teenager Alice Gross.

Yesterday, a judge at London’s High Court rejected Arava’s bid for bail in the UK while he awaits a hearing for his extradition to Romania, saying he is a serious ‘flight risk’.

Mr Justice Holroyde said Arava was first arrested in Romania over the alleged murder in 1990. The precise details of the offence were not given in court, but the Metropolitan Police have since confirmed it relates to a 1989 killing.

Arava was released without charge before he moved to the United States in 1991, entering illegally and being granted asylum before he was tried and convicted of the murder in Romania in his absence, the judge said.

However, the conviction was quashed on appeal in 1994 and Arava returned to Romania for a number of years, before he left for UK shores in 1998.

‘He entered the country illegally. Arava made a claim for asylum, which failed,’ the judge said. ‘He nonetheless remained in the UK with his wife and, over the years which passed since then, three children have been born to them.’

In 2000, Arava was again convicted of the 1989 murder in his absence in Romania and sentenced to 12 years behind bars in 2002. His guilt was later upheld by the country’s Appeal Court and Supreme Court.

Arava, however, insists he is entirely innocent and claims that he was completely unaware of both his fresh conviction and his unsuccessful appeals, the judge said.

An arrest warrant was issued by the authorities in Constanta, Romania, in March and he was arrested on June 10 outside his family home in Croydon, after the National Crime Agency was alerted to his presence.

Arava gave officers the same false name he had used when he was arrested by British cops in 2003 in an incident that led to his conviction for driving with excess alcohol — his sole criminal offence in the UK.

The killer is now facing a hearing in January over his proposed extradition to Romania so that he can serve his prison sentence, Mr Justice Holroyde said.

Arava’s legal team argued there were ‘serious matters’ standing in the way of him being sent to Romania, including the delay in his criminal proceedings, the safety of him being convicted in his absence and prison conditions in Romania.

Applying for bail in the mean time, Arava’s counsel, Daniel Jones, argued that he was unlikely to abscond, given his ‘strong family ties’ here and his wish to robustly resist his extradition.

Arguing that Arava gave a false name to police purely out of ‘panic’, the barrister explained that his friends had raised £15,000 to put up as security for his bail.

But Mr Justice Holroyde said: ‘The giving of a false name when confronted by the police and the fact that name was given on a previous encounter with the police are significant factors.

‘So too is the fact that a number of years ago he entered the US unlawfully and that, some years later, he entered this country unlawfully.

‘No doubt Arava wishes to stay with his family, but that, in my judgment, does not mean that he is not a flight risk.’

He concluded: ‘In these circumstances, I am satisfied that there is substantial risk here that, if granted bail, Arava would not surrender to that bail, given the extradition hearing in January.

‘This application fails and is refused.’

Fears over EU criminals moving to Britain were sparked in September when Arnis Zalkans, who had served a jail term for killing his wife in Latvia, was first sought by police over missing schoolgirl, Alice Gross.

The 41-year-old from west London was found hanged in woods in Boston Manor Park, Hounslow, in October, days after Alice’s lifeless body was discovered just a 20-minute walk away.

Tory MP Angie Bray said at the time: ‘The EU needs to make it compulsory for member states to maintain an up-to-date EU register of all criminal convictions so that anyone coming here can easily be identified if they have a criminal conviction.’
