Think of this as the third and final stage of Lionel Messi’s Barcelona career. We’ve had the shy and awkward boy wonder, we’ve had the fully developed, four- time Ballon d’Or winner, now we are in the age of Messi the leader. He’s in charge, and he’s not very happy.

The Barcelona board and their chosen coach are the principal reasons why he has started to wonder, since the middle of last season, if his future might lie somewhere else.

It was in December 2013 when, amid talk of a contract renewal, one of the club’s vice-presidents, Javier Faus, said he saw no reason ‘why the contract of this gentleman should be improved when it was revised only two years ago’.

It was the sarcastic reference to ‘this gentleman’ that particularly riled Messi. It suggested a change in attitude towards a player who previous president Joan Laporta had always treated as the club’s favourite son.

More important than the reluctance to improve his terms was the flippancy of the dismissal. The tone fitted the theory that the board would not be wholly against the idea of selling Messi. There is a new stadium to be built at a cost of £330million, after all, and what if his best years are behind him?

‘Senor Faus knows nothing about football,’ responded Messi. ‘He wants to run Barcelona like a business, which it is not.’

The player spent December 2013 in Argentina recovering from injury and when he came back he couldn’t prevent the team finishing the season without a trophy.

Messi feels that this board has neither backed nor protected him. He has brought some of the off-field problems on himself by failing to declare the correct amount of tax during a three-year period. But when that indiscretion encouraged a campaign against him that even had one newspaper, El Mundo, linking his father to a money-laundering ring connected to a drugs cartel, there was no closing of ranks around the star player as there would have been in the past.

This season the board has been the lesser evil, with coach Luis Enrique taking charge of the team in the summer.

Enrique left Messi on the bench for the first match of the new year - a defeat by Real Sociedad

The man who managed to fall out with both Francesco Totti and Daniele de Rossi at Roma picked 27 different teams for his first 27 matches in charge, antagonising senior dressing-room figures in the process.

He allowed Neymar and Messi to come back two days later than originally planned from the winter break but then left both out of the first game of the new year, which the team lost 1-0 to David Moyes’s Real Sociedad.

‘So now I’m OK to play?’ Messi is understood to have told his manager when, 1-0 down, he asked him to come on at the break.

That first match of 2015 was a tinker too far. Across the great La Liga divide at Real Madrid, Carlo Ancelotti tends to pick his best players for every game. Luis Enrique’s rotation has smacked of trying too hard to impose himself on a squad of superstars.

Gerard Pique, Dani Alves and Ivan Rakitic had also been victims of the chopping and changing and none have adequate replacements in a squad poorly assembled by the since-ousted sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta.

Messi rowed with his coach on the Friday before the Sociedad game, tensions were strained on the Sunday of the match and instead of training the following day, he stayed at home and followed Chelsea on Instagram.

Add that piece of social-network manoeuvering to the decision to name Jose Mourinho — for so long pantomime villain of the Clasicos, not least when he poked the late Tito Vilanova in the eye — as third on his list of top coaches, and it is little wonder the seeds of doubt have started to sprout.

The idea that Messi would never work with Mourinho was quashed in one fell swoop.

The Chelsea coach has already rubbished the idea that Financial Fair Play restrictions would ever allow Chelsea to make such a move. That is true if Messi’s price were his buy-out clause of £195m. But if he handed in a transfer request the price would fall.

The player’s long-term partner Antonella Roccuzzo certainly wouldn’t object to being closer to her best friend Daniella Semaan, the partner of Cesc Fabregas. Could London really be calling?

Playing the transfer-request card is the only way it could happen and that remains the player’s very last resort in this power play.

End-of-season elections will bring change to the club. Former president Laporta is poised to stand and Messi will back one candidate in June and that candidate will win by a landslide.

Anyone who can guarantee that he stays will be given the electorate’s seal of approval.

For that to be the case, however, the possibility of him walking away has to exist. Hence the occasional ‘I don’t even know where I will be next year’ admissions.

All great clubs follow the lead of one individual. Sometimes it’s a gregarious owner or president, sometimes it’s a charismatic manager and sometimes it’s an exceptional player.

There is a power void at Barcelona and Messi is ready to fill it. Now is the winter of his discontent — if he gets the president and coach he wants, in June it will be a glorious summer.
