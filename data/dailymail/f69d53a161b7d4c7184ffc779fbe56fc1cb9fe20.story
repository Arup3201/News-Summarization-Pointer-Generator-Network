A band teacher at a Michigan high school has been suspended for allegedly duct-taping a female student's ankles to her chair in a bid to improve her posture.

The teacher, identified by parents as Brian Sullivan, has been accused of taping the student's ankles to her chair because she would not keep her feet flat on the floor.

A number of students however have now petitioned Jefferson High School, in Monroe, Michigan, to allow him to return so the band can go on their planned trip to perform at Disney World, it has been reported.

Jefferson Schools Superintendent Craig Haugen said he had received a complaint against a teacher, but declined to give their identity.

He told Monroe News the teacher had been placed on paid administrative leave while an investigation was carried out into the incident.

The teacher reportedly wanted students to keep their feet flat on the floor to improve posture which helps them perform better.

Band booster Debbie Barron, whose daughter is in Mr Sullivan's class, said: 'You just can’t do that kind of stuff to kids anymore. But I don’t think he should lose his job.'

Mrs Barron said the girl had been wearing jeans and boots at the time of the alleged incident.

She said the an extended suspension could jeopardise the band's trip to Disney World, in Florida.

The band had been scheduled to leave for the trip on April 9.
