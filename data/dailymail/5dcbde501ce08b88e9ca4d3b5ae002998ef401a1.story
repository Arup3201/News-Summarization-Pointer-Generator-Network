Jess Varnish completed a four-title haul for a second consecutive year at the British Cycling National Track Championships.

The 22-year-old won women's keirin gold at the National Cycling Centre in Manchester on Sunday to add to her sprint, team sprint and 500 metres time-trial titles.

Varnish cruised through her first-round heat and waited until the final 100m of the final to pass Katy Marchant, who eventually finished third behind Dannielle Kahn.

'The keirin can be quite a lottery so I just wanted to go out and execute a good ride,' Varnish said.

Callum Skinner matched Varnish's accomplishment as part of the winning north west team sprint squad, the Scot joining Olympic champions Jason Kenny and Philip Hindes to defeat Sportcity Velo's Matt and Thomas Rotherham and Jack Payne by over two seconds in a time of 44.132 seconds.

Dame Sarah Storey took two laps on the field to win the women's points race and there was a second British title for Oliver Wood in the men's scratch race after his success in the team pursuit.
