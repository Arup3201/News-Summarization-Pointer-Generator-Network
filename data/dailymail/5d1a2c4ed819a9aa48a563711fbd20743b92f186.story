One of the biggest problems facing a wildlife photographer is how to get close enough to your quarry to get a good photograph.

But not for Will Burrard-Lucas, who was used as a lookout post by these cheeky meerkats, who even had a go at taking a picture themselves.

The adorable images were captured by wildlife photographer Mr Burrard-Lucas who spent six days with the new family in the Makadikgadi region of Botswana.

Wildlife photographer Will Lucas captured the family of meerkats while in the Makadikgadi region of Botswana

The cheeky youngsters used Mr Lucas as a lookout post before having a go at taking a picture themselves

The family included one female and four young pups. The adult keeps a lookout while her children look for food

Meerkats are famous for their upright stance, and females can even nurse their young while on their hind legs

Mr Burrard-Lucas has photographed meerkats in the past and was delighted when he found he would be snapping a few new arrivals.

He said: 'They're normally extremely cautious but these meerkats in particular have no fear of humans so they were more than happy for me to get close.

'They were climbing on me and trying to get as high as they could to have a good look around.

Meerkats are usually extremely cautious, diving for cover in their burrows as soon as danger threatens

However this family had no fear of humans, as they showed by climbing all over Mr Lucas while he took pictures

Meerkats are naturally hunted by birds of prey, and are so alert to aerial threats that the sight of a plane is enough to send the young ones running for cover

Meerkats are mammals, meaning the mother gives birth to live young. She typically has between four and six pups at any one time, and gives birth in a special burrow

'They are very small and the grass is quite long so they're always looking for vantage points.

'The new babies were only a few days old and I was fortunate enough to see them coming out of their den for the first time.

'They were really cute and you can see them trying to stand and look for predators already.

'In Africa there are a lot of predators so they are always on the lookout for potential danger.'

Meerkats are native to South Africa, where they live in large groups. The adults take it in turns to be lookouts, letting out a sharp, shrill call whenever danger is spotted

The mammals eat insects, lizards, birds, and fruit and communicate using purrs while on the hunt

Meerkats lie wild in South Africa, but are occasionally captures and trained as rodent catchers

Mr Lucas said that there are three families in the region who are known to be responsive to humans

The 30-year-old from Beaconsfield, Bucks, added: 'I love meerkats and always enjoy my trips to Africa.

'Fortunately the UK is as meerkat crazy as I seem to be so people are always happy to look through my work.'

Mr Lucas said the babies were only a few days old and he captured their first moments outside the burrow

Meerkat are always on the lookout for vantage points in the tall grass so they can easily spot the hawks and eagles which swoop down on them from the skies

Gaurd duty normally lasts for around an hour, with each of the adults taking turns to keep the group safe

He added: 'They live in groups because they are susceptible to predators. Usually one will stand guard while the others look for food.

'The guard will whistle loudly when a predator is nearby to alert the rest of the group.

'Guard duty normally lasts around an hour and the babies looked like they wanted to take part themselves.'
