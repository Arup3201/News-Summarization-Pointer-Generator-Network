A police officer was caught off guard on Monday night when a drug search led to a close encounter with a metre-long snake.

Senior Constable Christopher Knott stopped a cyclist who was riding without a helmet or safety lights at Seaford, south-east of Melbourne, just before midnight.

After a conversation with the cyclist, Officer Knott found himself searching through the 32-year-old's backpack.

'I found a little bit of methamphetamine and cannabis and, when I delved deeper, I found a snake,' he told Triple M.

Not particularly fond of snakes, the officer admitted that he jumped back when his fingers touched the metre long West Australian python.

'I touched it and I thought it was like one of those toy ones – one of the plastic or rubbery things that people throw around,' Constable Knott said.

'When I touched it and it just moved about an inch - that's when I realised it was a snake.'

Officer Knott said he had a stern conversation with the cyclist regarding the reptilian surprise, before taking him into custody and charging him with drug offences.

The rider told the officers that he had forgot to warn them about the reptile as he was 'too concerned' with what else they were finding.

The python, who he claimed he had a permit for, was a household pet that he couldn't bear to leave behind while he spent a few days in the CBD.
