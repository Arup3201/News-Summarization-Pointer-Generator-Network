Police in Miami are on the hunt for two heavily armed gunmen who killed a hero father protecting his 11-year-old daughter during a home invasion.

Maurice Harris was shot dead when two men burst into his family's home on 43rd Street and Northwest 16th Avenue and attempted to force their way to his girl's room.

'We're calling these two men beasts. They stormed inside the house and they ambushed this family,' said Miami Police Detective Kenia Reyes. 'A little girl was just asleep, when she's surprised by the gunfire, when the father was just trying to protect her.'

According to the victim's mother-in-law, Annie Streeter, the two masked men burst into the house just before midnight on Tuesday and put a gun to the head of Mr. Harris' wife.

'My granddaughter was asleep in her room. Her mother was asleep. The mother said when she came in, someone put a gun to her head and made the father get down on the floor,” said Streeter to WSVN.Com

'She said that someone took the gun and put it to her head and had them hostage there.

When one of the men attempted to make his way to the room of his sleeping daughter, Mr. Harris, who is reportedly disabled, fought back.

'One of the guys tried to get to his daughter's room, he jumped up and they were fighting back and forth,' said Streeter. 'I guess that's when the gun went off.'

Neighbor, Terry Jones, was full of praise for the brave dad's actions.

'Unfortunately, he died but he's super dad,' said Jones.

'I hope I have that much courage if something like that would've happened to me.'

There is no known motive for the shooters actions and they remain on the run.

Officials are urging anyone with information on the shooters' whereabouts to notify authorities. 'We're asking anyone with information at this point to immediately call police,' said Reyes.

Streeter said Harris, who suffered from Lupus, was taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital where he died.

Harris, 34, and his wife had been married for 14 years.
