Turkey has banned alcohol advertising and increased restrictions on alcohol sales today in a move likely to anger secularists who accuse the government of having an Islamic agenda.

It follows the move earlier this month forbidding female flight attendants at Turkey’s national airline from 
wearing red lipstick and nail polish.

The sale of alcohol -  which Islam forbids followers from consuming - will be outlawed from 10pm to 6am. Alcohol producers will have to place health warnings on packaging.

The law, which needs presidential approval before coming into effect, also bans alcohol-producing companies from sponsoring events.

Turkey
 has remained a secular consitution since the modernising reforms of 
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who threw religion out of public life in the 
1920s and 1930s as he rebuilt Turkey from the ruins of the Ottoman 
Empire.

The powerful 
military views itself as the ultimate guarantor of Turkey's secular 
order and has ousted four democratically elected governments in the past
 50 years, most recently in 1997 when with public support it drove out a
 cabinet it viewed as too Islamist.

The
 current government, led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is run by the Muslim 
AK party which has its roots in a banned Islamic movement.

He is currently serving his third term as Prime Minister heading the 
conservative faith based Justice and Development Party, also known as 
the AK Party.

He
 founded the AK Party in 2001 upon his release from prison where the 
former mayor of Istanbul, served ten months for reciting an illegal 
Islamist poem during a public address in the province of Siirt.

As
 he was banned from public office following the speech including the 
poem, he could not become Prime Minister when the party won the general 
election in 2002, a ban which was lifted in 2003.

However,
 under Erdogan’s leadership the country has relaxed restrictions on 
religious expression, including lifting the ban on head scarves in 
courts and schools.

Venues where alcohol is sold and consumed can no longer openly display drinks.

Turkey is 99 per cent Muslim, but the NATO state and European Union candidate has a secular constitution. 

There have been concerns in recent years that an increasingly wealthy but pious middle-class is emerging in Turkey that wants to practise its religion more freely.

Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party, which traces its roots to a banned Islamic party, has also come under strong pressure from grassroots supporters  to relax the state's control over the expression of religion.

Such restrictions were aimed at reining in Islamism and improving women's rights, but effectively prevented many devout women from studying at university or taking government jobs.

Mr Erdogan, whose wife Emine wears a headscarf, has previously said he is committed to secularism, but does not believe it should be at the expense of those who want to express their religious beliefs.

Critics of the ruling AK Party say it is responsible for Islamism taking root in Turkey.

Mr Erdogan's government denies those accusations. It says it is not trying to limit people's freedoms but aims to bring Turkey, which wants to join the European Union, up to European standards by tightening restrictions on the sale of alcohol and protecting the young.

Since coming to power in 2002, the ruling party has taken various measures to limit alcohol consumption, including imposing high taxes on alcoholic drinks.

National carrier Turkish Airlines has stopped serving alcohol on some domestic flights.
