On the job: Speaker John Bercow has called critics bitter about their own failings as politicians

Commons Speaker John Bercow has taken a swipe at MPs who criticise him, accusing them of being ‘embittered and resentful’ because their own careers have stalled.

The former Conservative launched a tirade against his Parliamentary detractors, saying MPs were still ‘sulking’ three years after he got the job.

The Buckingham MP said: ‘Sometimes people who perhaps haven’t achieved what they want to achieve in their political career can display some sign of resentment.

‘Not necessarily because they themselves wanted to be Speaker, but because they feel, “Well, my talents haven’t been recognised. That fellow was a rather free-wheeling, independent-minded” – perhaps even, in their minds – “disloyal backbench member, and suddenly he pops up as Speaker. And we don’t like it”.’

Mr Bercow told BBC Radio 4’s The World At One that he did not bear any grudges towards MPs who had not voted for him to become Speaker but said ‘they shouldn’t, three years on, be sulking about who won’.

In an extraordinary interview, Mr Bercow admitted that ‘I occasionally lost my rag’ with critics but said he tried not to get too angry as ‘you should never lose self-control’.

Mr Bercow has faced accusations that he is unfairly harsh on Tories while favouring Labour during Commons exchanges. He drew fury for allowing Labour MP Chris Bryant to call Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt a ‘liar’ and failing to ask him to retract the insult.

Mr Bercow let slip that he had sought expert advice from the senior Commons clerk before the exchange in anticipation that such a term might have been used. But he denied Mr Bryant had tipped him off.

The Speaker also angered Tory MPs by hauling David Cameron before the Commons to answer Labour questions over Mr Hunt’s handling of Rupert Murdoch’s bid to take control of broadcaster BSkyB.

He said: ‘Much as I have the highest respect for the Prime Minister... the Prime Minister’s job is to captain his team, his party, his government; my job is to be the referee.’

Mr Bercow also said he was ‘supremely uninterested’ in much of what was written in newspapers, before launching into a lengthy attack on the Press.

‘Their utterances are absolutely of no interest to me whatsoever,’ he said. ‘I’m sorry to disappoint them, but they’re just not important.’

He defended his wife Sally – a Labour activist and reality TV star  who is frequently in the headlines for her antics – as ‘my asset’, declaring: ‘Above all she’s my wife, whom I love’.

Mr Bercow called her critics  ‘no-hopers’ and ‘the sort of people who  wouldn’t dare to debate the issue in any very public way’, adding: ‘They certainly wouldn’t take me on.’

He said some people thought he was ‘genuine and down-to-earth’ but admitted others thought he was ‘puffed up with his own importance’.
