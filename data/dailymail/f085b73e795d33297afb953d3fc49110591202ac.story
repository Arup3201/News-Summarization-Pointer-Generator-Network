Victoria Beckham has design a T-shirt in support of World Aids Day 2014

The T-shirt costs £90 and will be sold at the Victoria Beckham London store and online

The T-shirt will be sold at the chic minimalist Victoria Beckham Dover Street Store in London as well as online at victoriabeckham.com.

Having recently been appointed as UNAIDS Global Goodwill Ambassador, Victoria is donating all proceeds from the sale of the t-shirt and pin  to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/Aids (UNAIDS) to support their efforts in ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030.

'My personal commitment to raise awareness and resources to end the AIDS epidemic is one that is shared by my brand and we wanted to mark World Aids Day with an initiative that my customers could also participate in,' the former Spice Girl said of her charitable venture.

Victoria  made her debut on the political world stage back in September when she was formally named as a goodwill ambassador

Speaking at the United Nations building in New York upon the announcement of her new role she said was ‘honoured’ to be made an ambassador for their UNAIDS campaign. 

Beckham – who missed the opening of her London store to be there – said she was inspired following a recent trip to South Africa, where she met with children stricken by the deadly disease.

The fashion designer visited Cape Town in February as part of the Born Free initiative, which tackles the issue of HIV being transmitted from mothers to their children

In August, Beckham hosted an online sale of 600 items from her wardrobe to raise money and awareness for mothers living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa.

However this T-shirt represents the first marriage between Victoria's lucrative fashion label and her UN work. 

Beckham – who missed the opening of her London store to recieve a certificate marking her role as a UN Goodwill Amb ambassador in September– said she felt her public profile meant she had a duty to do more

She said: 'I recently visited South Africa and was so touched by the women I met and felt inspired. I came home and I knew I had to do something'

'I am so pleased that Victoria is choosing to mark World Aids Day 2014 with this excellent initiative bringing together the worlds of fashion and activism.

'Thanks to her commitment as UNAIDS Global Goodwill Ambassador, we will raise awareness and much needed resources to get closer to our shared vision of zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths,' said Michel Sidibé Executive Director of UNAIDS.

The Victoria Beckham Jeans white T-shirt, £90, will be available from December 1st, through to December 31st.

In addition, all those who purchase the t-shirt will receive a small red World Aids Day ribbon pin which is also available for purchase for £1 at the store.

Both the store and the website will also mark the day with a red tint takeover in both the window and on the homepage.

The UN is working towards the goal of ending the HIV epidemic by 2030.

The most recent figures, collected in 2013, revealed 35 million people were living with HIV - an estimated 0.8 per cent of the world's adult population.

There were 2.1 million adults and children newly infected with HIV last year.

1.5 million adults and children died of HIV in 2013.

Just 15 countries account for more than 75 per cent of the 2.1 million new HIV infections that occurred in 2013.

Nine are in Africa: Cameroon, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

But the spotlight is also on Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia, and the United States.

The burden of HIV varies from country to country, as does each country's resources for treating the disease.

One of the key problems is that 19 million of the 35 million people living with HIV today do not know that they have the virus.

HIV is more prevalent among people who inject drugs, sex workers, men who have gay sex and transgender women, than among the rest of the adult population.

Michel Sidibé, executive director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/Aids said: 'If we accelerate all HIV scale-up by 2020, we will be on track to end the epidemic by 2030.

'If not, we risk significantly increasing the time it would take - adding a decade, if not more.'
