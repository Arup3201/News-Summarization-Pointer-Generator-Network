A desperate Manhattan man cradled his longtime love and begged her not to die Monday after she was tragically hit by a truck on the Upper East Side while celebrating her 65th birthday.

'Mi amor! Mi amor!' 68-year-old Ramon Ramirez sobbed in Spanish as he held his companion, Olga Rivera, who lay motionless on the sidewalk. 'Please don't die. Not today. How could this happen on your birthday?'

The grandmother-of-three later succumbed to her injuries in hospital. Two other victims - a mother and her 9-year-old daughter - are still fighting for their lives.

Longtime love: Police had to pull the inconsolable Ramon Ramirez, pictured, away from Olga Rivera, who he had dated for a decade, to let first responders work

The box truck jumped a curb at the corner of 102nd Street and Park Avenue and struck Rivera just before 1 p.m. after it was T-boned by a yellow cab.

The taxi emerged from a tunnel under the Metro-North tracks on westbound East 102nd Street and collided with the southbound truck, sending it careening onto the sidewalk and into Rivera. Ramirez jumped out of the way at the last second, witnesses told The New York Daily News.

The cab's two passengers, the mother and daughter whose names haven't been released, were in critical condition Monday night at New York-Presbyterian Hospital Weill Cornell.

The wreck's heart-wrenching aftermath was captured by photographers including Bronx-based Edwin Pagan.

The Bronx resident died in the emergency room at Mount Sinai Medical Center, distraught relatives told the Daily News.
