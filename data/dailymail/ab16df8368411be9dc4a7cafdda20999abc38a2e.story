Leonard Webb, 68, appeared in court today accused of murder. It is alleged he stabbed his wife Doreen, 64, in the chest on Good Friday

A retired British Army officer has appeared in court today accused of murdering his wife of more than 40 years on Good Friday.

Leonard Webb, 68, is alleged to have stabbed his 64-year-old wife Doreen to death in their home in Durrington, Wiltshire.

The man, described by neighbours as a retired Colonel, appeared before a special sitting of magistrates' today  charged with murder.

He was remanded into custody at the brief hearing at Chippenham Magistrates' Court.

Emergency services were called to the home at 1.45pm on Good Friday.

There, medics battled to save nursery worker Doreen from a knife wound to the chest.

Ambulance sources said 
desperate efforts were made to save Mrs Webb's life, including opening 
up her chest and massaging her heart.

However, she was declared dead soon afterwards.

Neighbours told how they saw a man being led away by police in handcuffs shortly after the incident.

Mrs
 Webb's body was taken to the local Salisbury General 
Hospital.

Yesterday, a  pathologist carried 
out a post mortem examination to ascertain the exact cause of her death - the result of which is yet to be released.

More than a dozen floral tributes were left outside the semi-detached property where the couple lived - which remained cordoned off by police who stood guard at the house today.

One elderly neighbour, who asked not to 
be named, said Mr and Mrs Webb had lived in the quiet residential street
 for at least 30 years.

Medics rushed to save Doreen, 64, a nursery worker who was found at the property in Durrington, Wiltshire

'Everybody here is amazed because they were such a good couple,' said the woman. 'You couldn't have wished for a happier couple.'

'None of us can believe what has happened. He was an officer in the Army. I think he was a Colonel before he retired.'

Webb is thought to have ran a military business selling old swords and bayonets. Webb was remanded into custody until April 23.
