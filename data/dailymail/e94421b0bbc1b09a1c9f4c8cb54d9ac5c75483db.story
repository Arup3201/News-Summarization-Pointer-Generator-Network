Grigor Dimitrov beat 17-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer in an exhibition match at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday in a confidence-building victory for the younger player.

Dimitrov won 6-2, 1-6, 7-5, rallying from a break down in the final set.

The 23-year-old Bulgarian is 0-3 in official matches against Federer, who is ten years older at 33.

Dimitrov broke Federer's serve in the final game to clinch the match, held as part of the World Tennis Day celebrations.

Federer said: 'I think he played very well. He did really well to turn the match around, honestly. So credit to him. It's a lot of pressure - first time at the Garden.'

Earlier, Gabriela Sabatini, 44, beat Monica Seles, 41, in a pro set 8-5.

Both have rarely played since retiring, but they decided it was worth training to commemorate the 25th anniversary of their classic five-set 1990 WTA Finals match at the Garden, won by Seles.
