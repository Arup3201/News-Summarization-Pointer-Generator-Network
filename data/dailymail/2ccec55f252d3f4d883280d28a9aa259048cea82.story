Former President George H.W. Bush will remain hospitalized through Christmas Day after being admitted for shortness of breath.

Family spokesman Jim McGrath said Thursday evening that the 90-year-old remained at Houston Methodist Hospital for a third day but 'had another terrific day and is in great spirits'.

He said Bush was visited by his wife, Barbara Bush, as well as son Neil Bush, after being hospitalized Tuesday night in what was reported as a precaution.

President Barack Obama and first lady lady sent 'their good wishes to the former president and the entire Bush family during this holiday season', according to White House spokesman Eric Schultz, after hearing about Bush's condition while vacationing in Hawaii.

Hospital for the holidays: George H.W. Bush, 90 - pictured here on November 3 - has spent a third night at Houston Methodist Hospital after being admitted Tuesday for shortness of breath

THe oldest living president's hospitalization was 'out of abundance of caution', a family spokesperson said. He is pictured here at a Houston Texans game on November 23

Bush is the oldest living former American president.

He suffers from a form of Parkinson's disease that has forced him to rely on a motorized scooter or wheelchair.

But he's also skydived on at least three of his birthdays since leaving the White House, including a tandem jump for his 90th birthday in June.

Bush spent Christmas 2012 in intensive care at the same hospital while being treated for a bronchitis-related cough and other issues. 

He was discharged in January 2013, after nearly two months in the hospital. 

Bush made two public appearances last month. He attended an event at Texas A&M University with his son, former President George W. Bush, and served as the coin-toss captain for the Houston Texans during a Nov. 23 game that honored the US Armed Forces.

The elder Bush was a naval aviator in World War II — at one point the youngest in the Navy — and was shot down over the Pacific.

Methodist Hospital in Houston is the top-rated hospital in Texas and is nationally ranked, as well

Bush served two terms as Ronald Reagan's vice president before being elected the nation's 41st president in 1988. After one term, highlighted by the success of the 1991 Gulf War in Kuwait, he lost to Democrat Bill Clinton amid voters' concerns about the economy.

The elder Bush has skydived on at least three of his birthdays since leaving the White House. In June, he celebrated his 90th birthday by making a tandem parachute jump near his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine. During the winter, Bush and his wife, Barbara, live in Houston.

Bush, also a former U.S. ambassador to China and CIA director, suffers from a form of Parkinson's disease that has forced him in recent years to use a motorized scooter or wheelchair for mobility. 

Bush's wife, Barbara Bush, made a surprise visit with Houston Texans' JJ Watt at the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts in Houston on Tuesday evening to perform 'Twas the Night Before Christmas.'

It's not clear whether she was with the 41st U.S. president when he experienced his shortness of breath  

Methodist Hospital is rated as the top hospital in Texas by US News & World Report. It is ranked nationally, as well.
