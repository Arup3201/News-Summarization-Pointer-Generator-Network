Anthony Joshua believes his monastic lifestyle has helped him shut out his growing celebrity status and focus on becoming a world champion.

The undefeated heavyweight marks the first anniversary of his professional career on Saturday night when he takes on Denis Bakhtov for his first title, the WBC International belt.

But Joshua refuses to be distracted by the inevitable hype that has accompanied his first eight fights.

'Not much has changed,' he said. 'I've got a lot more fans now that's for sure as I have boxed around the country, but I have been in the gym so I haven't been able to see the impact, it's a basic lifestyle really,

'Because I am boxing so much, the turnaround is short. Bernard Hopkins said what has kept him in the game for so long is avoiding the celebrity lifestyle – that's what I need to do. I haven't had time to have a holiday, I would like to do that, eat some nice food in some tiny restaurants but I haven't been able to.

'I am aware of the expectations around me and the potential that the great guys achieved. I'm at the start of my career like they all were and I know that hard work is the key. If I keep my head down and work hard I can reach the top.

'I have improved, I am fitter and I understand more. Right now I am that Airich level really – I learn how to deal with the event but training is 50 times harder than the fight.

'I keep the blinkers on. It's what I signed up for, I know that if things go well next week then there will be more interested. I understand the pressure that comes with it but when you are winning there's no stopping you, my motto is to stay hungry and it's that simple.

'As an amateur I worked with sports psychologists and I have read books on it. Everyone has their level and I haven't found it as a pro. Even if I just achieve British level, as long as I give it 110 per cent then I am happy with that. I haven't brought into it yet as I haven't achieved it yet. I have the contender mentality and I am very self-critical.

'Bakhtov is a lot busier than my last opponent. I look at him the same as I looked at Matt Legg, one of my previous opponents, just with a lot more experience. Legg came out with a lot of hooks and gave it a go. Bakhtov can take punches for fun, and he'll be looking to get to me. Hopefully, he'll be the one eating a lot of shots. I have to get the win really. Simple as that.'
