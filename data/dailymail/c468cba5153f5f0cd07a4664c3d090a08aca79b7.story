Jilted lover Scott Thorson has revealed shocking details of his relationship with Liberace -- and is now back in jail 'for an alleged probation violation and failing to appear in court', TMZ reports.

Prior to his arrest on Wednesday, Thorson described in an interview for 'Oprah: Where Are they Now?,'  the lavish lifestyle he enjoyed as Liberace's lover.

'Although we had our differences, we had more good times than bad times. Well, I mean it was a wonderful life. I was 16 years old, I was walking around with all these jewels -- you know, a million dollars worth of jewelry, 30 cars. I had more mink coats and diamonds than Elizabeth Taylor had,' he said.

In the video, Thorson also described how he received plastic surgery to resemble a young Liberace at his lover's request.

'It was amazing, the resemblance afterwards -- the same chin, it was just amazing,' he said.

Thorson also alleged in the interview that Liberace introduced him to using drugs.

'When it got out of control, he just decided that he was going to discard me like a piece of trash. Cut off my credit cards, cut off all the cash,' he told the special.

Thorson later sued Liberace for palimony, the video adds, and is believed to have received $95,000 in a settlement.

'The reason why I sued Liberace was because he threw me on the streets and I had nothing. He called me a disgruntled employee. That I was a street hustler, that I was liar. That there was never a sexual relationship. That I was nothing but a gold digger. And I was just a young kid.'

Thorson was booked on Wednesday, TMZ reports. He had been on probation for a burglary and ID conviction from earlier this year. He also faced a drug violation in September but received a rehab sentence, the website adds.

Thorson, the Associated Press reports, was forced to reside in Washoe County as a result of a determination by probation officials. His lawyer, David Houston, told the Associated Press in September 'He was living in what I would refer to as a drug-infested area. If you put enough stress on an individual and make things seem helpless you do get a certain result - in this case a relapse.'

Prior to his September arrest, Thorson had spent time at the famous Moonlite Bunny Ranch Brothel, under the supervision of owner Dennis Hof. 

'Scott is the dysfunctional son that I never wanted but I am willing to still help him out. He has an addiction problem and needs constant supervision to beat his problem,' Hof told The National Enquirer.

'I partially blame the courts for his ongoing problem -- they refused to allow him to stay with me at the Bunny Ranch which is a clean, drug-free sober environment.'

Hof also told The National Enquirer that 'as soon as they put him back out [in] Reno he was surrounded by temptations that will always get the best of him.'
