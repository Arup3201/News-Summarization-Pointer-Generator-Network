After winning the Tour de France and an Olympic gold medal last year, it is no surprise that Sir Bradley Wiggins wants to give his legs a much needed rest. 

Instead of getting on his racing bike, the 33-year-old Mod who is known for his mutton-chopped sideburns and Fred Perry t-shirts, was spotted in Southport cruising around on a white and gold scooter. 

The BBC Sports Personality of the Year winner, who was awarded a knighthood in the 2013 New Year Honours, recently shaved off his trademark sideburns but kept up his Mod credentials speeding around on the moped while sporting a pair of Wayfarer sunglasses.

The cycling champion was filming an advert for clothing label Fred Perry on Southport pier and appeared to be riding a Lambretta 200 Special thought to have been presented to Bradley as a gift from the clothing range.

The Olympic gold medalist recently collaborated with the label to create a cycling inspired collection of apparel, footwear and accessories.

The advert should hit the TV screens in September 2013.

This week Wiggins, who last year became the first British winner of the Tour de France, made it clear he is unlikely to tackle the world's most prestigious cycle race.

Champion: This week Wiggins said he is unlikely to take part in the Tour de France again

He said he doubted whether he could 
subject himself and his family to the physical and mental torture it 
takes to win the race again.

Wiggins, nicknamed Wiggo, was born in Ghent, Belgium, before moving to London where he began track cycling.

He has won six gold medals at the track world championships, his first in 2003 and his most recent in 2008.

He won a gold in the individual pursuit at the 2004 Olympic Games and two golds in the individual and team pursuit at the 2008 Olympic Games.

After the 2008 Olympics, Wiggins took a break from the track to focus on the road.

In 2012, the cyclist won the Paris–Nice, the Tour de Romandie, the Critérium du Dauphiné, and became the first British cyclist to win the Tour de France as well as the time trial at the Olympic Games.

He is hoping 
to return to racing in the Tour of Poland, which begins on July 27, with
 September’s Tour of Britain also on the horizon.

He also aims to take part in the world championships in Florence at the end of September.
