How refreshing it was to see Danny Welbeck properly celebrate scoring for Arsenal against former club Manchester United on Monday night.

The striker's passion was clear to see as he bounded backwards across the Old Trafford turf, letting out a roar of celebration as Alexis Sanchez and Santi Cazorla rushed over to celebrate the moment.

'The emotion takes over,' he said afterwards. 'It was difficult to keep it in.' Quite right too. Welbeck had every reason to celebrate and let all that pent-up frustration out.

The Arsenal striker celebrates with team-mates Alexis Sanchez and Santi Cazorla after scoring 

At United since the age of eight, he was booted out the door in the summer by Louis van Gaal, who claimed he wasn't good enough to be a first team player at United.

So, on his first return to Old Trafford, Welbeck had a major point to prove and when Antonio Valencia under-hit a back pass to goalkeeper David de Gea, he seized his chance.

Skilfully taking the ball around the Spaniard, he passed it into an empty net before celebrating whole-heartedly but still with plenty of respect for the United fans.

Welbeck could certainly teach these players, who took the whole not celebrating against a former club thing a little too seriously.

Shaun Wright-Phillips (Chelsea vs QPR, January 2013)

Wright-Phillips wasn't wanted by Chelsea. They spent £21m to sign him and then kept him as a bit-part player until finally ditching him three years later having wasted the best years of his career.

So when the winger earned Queens Park Rangers an improbable win at Stamford Bridge during their 2013 relegation struggle, with his first league goal in nearly three years, you'd expect him to be thrilled.

Nope. Wright-Phillips looked downright miserable, an island of indifference as his team-mates celebrated jubilantly around him.

Adam Johnson (SUNDERLAND vs Manchester City, December 2012)

Likewise with Johnson, who had great expectations when he joined Manchester City from Middlesbrough in 2010 but was barely given a chance by Roberto Mancini.

Indeed, Johnson revealed when he escaped to Sunderland that he was barely on speaking terms with the Italian manager towards the end, having been dropped without explanation on a number of occasions during a turbulent two-and-a-half years.

So when Johnson gained his revenge by scoring the winner against City a few months after leaving, you'd expect something a bit more animated than just a raised hand of apology.

Romelu Lukaku (West Brom vs EVERTON, September 2014)

Opening your account for a new club, especially after a £28m move, should be kind of a big deal.

But Lukaku looked embarassed that his maiden goal for Everton had come at West Brom, the club where he spent the 2012-13 season on loan from Chelsea.

Still, at least he earned an appreciative round of applause from the Hawthorns crowd for his sheepish raised hand 'celebration.'

Jonjo Shelvey (Liverpool vs SWANSEA CITY, February 2014)

Shelvey made 47 league appearances for Liverpool over the course of his three seasons there, scoring two goals. Hardly the stuff of Kop folklore.

But the midfielder felt the need to apologise to the Anfield crowd after scoring a lovely 20-yard goal on his return there with Swansea last year.

It did earn him a round of applause from the Liverpool fans though.
