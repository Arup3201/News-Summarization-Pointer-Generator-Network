Russia is to offer to share its 
security secrets with Britain – but will rebuff demands to extradite the
chief suspect in the radiation murder of a dissident in London.

The revelations were made by Moscow’s 
ambassador Alexander Yakovenko in highly unusual public remarks ahead of
a visit to the Russian capital by David Cameron next week.

He insisted the Kremlin would not 
agree to send Andrei Lugavoy, prime suspect in the 2006 murder of 
dissident Alexander Litvinenko, for trial in Britain as Scotland Yard 
has demanded.

Friends again: Mr Cameron hopes to repair relations with Moscow when he visits Vladimir Putin next week

Mr Litvinenko, a British citizen and 
critic of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, was poisoned with a 
radioactive isotope,polonium-210.

Mr Cameron’s decision to visit Russia 
has caused some surprise, since Moscow has refused to budge over the 
extradition of Lugavoy, an ex-KGB agent.

Despite the hard line on Lugavoy, the 
ambassador revealed that Russia was prepared to reopen intelligence 
sharing with Britain in the fight against terrorism.

Rift: The poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 caused strains relations between Russia and Britain

‘Co-operation stopped after the Litvinenko case,’ he said.

‘We believe we have to re-establish these relations.

‘Everything is in the hands of the British side. We’re ready.’

A diplomatic tit-for-tat in recent years has seen rows over BP contracts,

the closure of British Council offices in Russia and the presence of several prominent critics of Mr Putin in London.

Mr Yakovenko said Britain had had no official contact with Mr Putin for several years.

On the Litvinenko case, Mr Yakovenko suggested Britain should agree to Lugavoy standing trial in Russia.

Mr Cameron’s trip to Moscow will be 
the first by a British leader since 2005. He is expected to meet Mr 
Putin and President Dmitri Medvedev.

The Prime Minister is determined not 
to let the row over Mr Litvinenko’s murder derail a summit that 
officials hope will lead to trade deals and warmer ties.
