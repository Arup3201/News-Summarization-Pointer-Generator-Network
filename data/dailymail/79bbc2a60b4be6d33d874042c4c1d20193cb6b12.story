Lewis Hamilton's unrivalled speed was on show as he dominated the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne.

But Formula One's reigning world champion chose a different gear when he visited Sydney, the Victorian capital's fierce rival to the north.

Hamilton got behind the wheel of a luxurious yacht on Sydney Harbour after a day of interviews in which he supported talk of a street circuit grand prix in the city in the near future.

'After a long day of media yesterday, sailing in Sydney with friends was a great way to end the day!' Hamilton posted  on Instagram.

'Sydney is such a beautiful city. Can't wait to come back next year.'

Hamilton finished 1.3secs ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg in Melbourne as he put a rocky off-season, which included breaking up with his pop singer girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger, behind him.

He described the win as 'reassuring' before heading to Sydney for a 36-hour visit.

While there Hamilton, who has spoken of his desire to pursue a career in the music industry, checked out some local talent as Angus and Julia Stone performed for an episode of the TV show Live At The Chapel in a former church.

Continuing his love affair for Sydney, Hamilton said he would welcome the F1's move to Sydney if a proposed street circuit format gets the go-ahead when the Melbourne contract expires.

'I have heard of the potential for a street race here and I love street circuits,' Hamilton told the Daily Telegraph.

'Street circuits are the best. For a driver they're the best and it's best for people to get close to — some 300,000 to 400,000 people leaning out of apartment windows.

'I've only been to Sydney a couple of times now but I've seen pictures of the Opera House and it's always so sunny. I really enjoy it when I come here. The weather's always fantastic.'
