Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins is upset to have heard that Liverpool are talking to Wilfried Bony without making an official approach to the Welsh club first.

It is understood that representatives of the player and Liverpool have met to sound out if Bony, who moved to Swansea from Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem for £12million last summer, is interested in a move.

But Jenkins told Sportsmail: 'I have no idea about that. The only thing I'd say is I'm completely unaware of contact between Liverpool and myself.

'I was very surprised to hear and disappointed to hear that Liverpool had gone down that route and were talking to the player behind behind my club's back. I'm disappointed that Liverpool are acting in that manner. No official approach has been made to me or our football club.'

It is understood that Bony has a £19m release clause and is keen on a move to the Merseyside club.

The 25-year-old wants to leave Swansea but is eager to stay in the Barclays Premier League and join a club who will be playing Champions League football next season.

Bony scored twice in three games for Ivory Coast as they made a surprise exit from the World Cup in the group stage after conceding a stoppage time goal against Greece in their last game.

He scored 25 goals in 49 matches in all competitions for Swansea in his first season in the Premier League. The 17 goals he netted in the top flight made him joint-fourth top goalscorer alongside Wayne Rooney and Sergio Aguero.

Liverpool are keen to bring in a replacement for Luis Suarez, who is on the verge of a move to Barcelona. But Swansea are still intent on keeping hold of the striker.

Jenkins added: 'That's always a priority to keep hold of your best players.'
