Australian parents' hip pockets are being hit hard by the rising expenses of school camps and excursions, prompting concerns on children from low-income families missing out.

Parents are battling to pay even the basic costs of a public-school education but a new survey has revealed costs of school trips  range from $250 to $1100.

While schools regularly offer financial help, parents have had to plan months ahead for when unexpected extras like school trips come up to make sure their kids are not the only ones left out.

Parents' hip pockets are being hit hard by the rising expenses of primary school camps and excursions

Sydney Morning Herald reports year 6 students from Lindfield Public School went away for five nights in August at a cost of $1100 per student. 

The cost covered two nights in Canberra, three nights at a ski-lodge in Jindabyne, ski lessons, equipment hire and lift pass.

Year 9 students from Mosman High School went away for a five-night camp, costing $924, which covered accommodation, a three-day ski-lift pass, equipment hire and daily skiing lessons.

Year 6 students from Gapuwiyak School in Northern Territory flew to Sydney for a week-long excursion, at a cost of around $1500, which covers airfares, activities and accommodation. 

'The trip is usually subsidised by one of the health organisations so parents only cover the costs of airfares for their child, which is usually $1000,' teacher Mick Montague told Daily Mail Australia.

Despite the rising expenses, Cabramatta West Public School teacher Mathew Halloran told Daily Mail Australia that school camps were a good opportunity for kids to experience independence.

'The best thing about school camp is giving the kids a chance to look after themselves for a few days, which works on their organisation, social skills and confidence.

New survey reveals costs of school trips across Sydney schools range from $250 to $1100

While some camps have hit the $1000 mark in the city, country schools have had financial assistance  to help subsidise the costs of excursions.

Former Gulgong High School student, who wished to not be named, told Daily Mail Australia that going to school in a country town, camps were often subsidised for educational trips.

'When I went to ones purely for academic reasons, we often got grants from government groups where they'd subsidise our transport and accommodation so we could go,' she said.

A Caragabal Public School teacher, who wished to remain anonymous, said being at a small rural school, expenses are not as expensive compared to larger schools.

'We have a really small school so we receive extra funding for different reasons, which also helps subsidise the costs of excursions,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'However, normally in larger schools, parents would have to foot the entire bill so they can get expensive.'

Parents have had to plan months ahead for when unexpected extras like school excursions come up to make sure their kids can go

A NSW Department of Education spokesman told Sydney Morning Herald: 'Where financial hardship is understood to be the reason for a student's non-participation, schools must endeavour to provide financial assistance,' the spokesman said.

'Unless exceptional circumstances exist, all students should have the opportunity to participate in an excursion.
