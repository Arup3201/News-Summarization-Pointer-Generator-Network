Police have arrested a suspect in a brutal double murder where two sisters were killed more than 30 years after the killings took place. 

Edmond Beauregard Degan is accused of the murder of sisters Yleen and Lillie Kennedy in 1984 and is being held in Harris County Jail, Houston without bond according to city records.

Police received a tip-off from a man who had been arrested that Degan was responsible for the murder. 

Officers checked DNA from the crime scene against Degan's and are believed to have discovered a match.

Investigators found that Yleen, 33, was beaten, stabbed, shot and sexually assaulted while her younger sister Lillie, 23, was shot. 

Cold case officers managed to secure some DNA from the murder in 2009 and developed a profile of the killer. 

Police received a tip off late in 2014 that Degan may have been responsible for the killings and tested his DNA. 

He has previous convictions for aggravated robbery, assault, making a terrorist threat and possession of drugs.

The tip off came as a man facing charges in an unrelated cases offered police information on the 30 year old murder. 

Sergeant Paul Motard of the Houston Homicide Division's cold case squad said: 'He tells his attorney, "I want to get this out" and just started telling us the story.'

'It was something this guy knew from the day it happened. He knew the defendant.'

The unnamed informer had been charged with an offence which could see him spend between two and four years in prison if he's convicted.  

Officers had arrested and questioned Degan at the time of the murders but he had been quickly ruled out as a suspect.
