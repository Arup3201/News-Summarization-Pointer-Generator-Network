Held: Victor Miller, 37, who was arrested for allegedly breaking in to Buckingham Palace, is currently being detained in a mental health unit

A suspected burglar arrested after being discovered in a royal state room at Buckingham Palace is being held in a mental health unit, it has emerged. 

DJ Victor Miller, 37, was found 'in an area currently open to the public during the day' after scaling a 12ft fence to get into the palace.

Miller, from Bow, East London, was arrested for burglary, trespass and criminal damage on Monday and was last night being held in a mental health unit where he will stay for 28 days for assessment.

The DJ, who claims to have worked with Amy Winehouse, N-Dubz and Tinchy Strider through his production company UK Artist Development, is believed to have been targeting priceless Coronation diamonds on display at the Palace. 

A spokesman 
for the Metropolitan Police said: 'A man was passed into the care of 
mental health professionals following bail'. They declined to comment 
further.

A security review has now been launched 
and Scotland Yard is facing a major inquiry following the break-in. No 
members of the royal family were present at the palace at the time of 
the incident.

A 
second man, 38, was arrested outside the palace for conspiracy to commit
burglary following the incident shortly before 10.30pm on Monday. He has since been bailed.

According to reports, police and security rushed to the palace after motion senors were set off.

The
intruder is said to have made his way to the State Rooms where all the 
Queen's priceless paintings by artists, including Titan Leonardo da 
Vinci, and artefacts are kept.

Target: It is believed Miller was targeting the diamond necklace the Queen wore on her coronation day which is currently being displayed in the State Rooms as part of an exhibit to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the event

There are 19 State Rooms which are open to the public during daily tours.

Police are said to have found the man trying to smash a glass door in one of the rooms with a fire extinguisher.

It is believed he was targeting jewels on display for the 60th anniversary of the Queen's coronation.

The exhibit includes the necklace worn by the Queen on her coronation. It was made for Queen Victoria and features 25 diamonds set around a 22.48 carat Lahore diamond pendant.

The ornamental crown made in 1820 for George IV which has a staggering 1,333 diamonds is also on display at the exhibition.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police 
said: 'Both men have been bailed to return to a central London police 
station and enquiries continue.

Not present: The Queen has been spending her summer break at Balmoral Castle since the beginning of August

Security: A security review has now been launched following the break-in

'A review of the specific 
circumstances of this incident is being carried out. No members of the 
Royal Family were at Buckingham Palace at the time of the incident.'

A spokesman added that security would form part of the review.

According to The Sun, a source close to the investigation said: 'This breach of security is being treated with the utmost seriousness.'

The security breach at Buckingham 
Palace, which is meant to be one of the best-guarded buildings in 
Britain, has been described as 'alarming' by a former royal protection 
commander.

Breach: The break-in is one of the most serious security breaches at the palace since 1982, when Michael Fagan evaded guards and walked into the Queen's bedroom

Dai Davies, a former head of Metropolitan Police's royal protection squad, said the incident demonstrates that terrorists could enter the Palace.

He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'It's alarming that as well as scaling the fence this individual managed to get inside the Palace itself before being stopped.

'Intruders should be apprehended well before this point.

'Questions will have to be asked about this incident at the highest level, particularly with regard to why the suspect appears to have gained entry to the Palace with such apparent ease. It is both disturbing and embarrassing.'

Buckingham Palace have not commented on the incident.

The Queen has been spending her summer 
break at Balmoral Castle since the beginning of August and is not 
expected to return to the palace until October.

She is expected to make her traditional appearance at a Highland Games today.

The Braemar Gathering is held each year just a short distance from the Balmoral estate in Aberdeenshire.

The break-in is one of the most serious security breaches at the palace since 1982, when Michael Fagan evaded guards to get inside the Queen's private chambers while she was still in bed.

The unemployed father of four, 31, spent around 10 minutes talking to the Queen after he climbed over the palace walls and up a drainpipe.

The Queen managed to raise the alarm when Fagan asked for a cigarette, allowing her to call for a footman who held him until police arrived.

The break-in at Buckingham Palace is the latest in a series of security scares involving the Royal Family.

In March 2011 a car carrying the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall (below) was mobbed by demonstrators who had split from a protest against higher university tuition fees.

Camilla was visibly distressed after being poked in the ribs with a stick through an open window in the distinctive Rolls-Royce Phantom VI as she and Charles travelled to the Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium.

In 2003, comedian Aaron Barschak managed to get into Prince William's 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle.

The self-styled 'comedy-terrorist' set off a series of alarms and was caught on CCTV before he joined 300 guests at the bash and was removed.

In 1994, student David Kang charged at Charles while firing a starting pistol during a ceremony in Sydney, Australia.

Kang was wrestled to the ground by New South Wales premier John Fahey and another man, while Charles was praised for his calm reaction.

In 1981, six blank shots were fired from the crowd while the Queen rode during the Trooping the Colour ceremony.

The Queen's horse was startled but she managed to bring it back under control while police rushed to grab the shooter.

In 1974, Princess Anne was the target of an apparent kidnap attempt in The Mall near Buckingham Palace.

Four people, including her bodyguard, Jim Beaton, were injured after shots were fired when their car was forced to halt by another vehicle which blocked their route.

A police officer chased the driver, Ian Ball, and brought him to the ground before arresting him.
