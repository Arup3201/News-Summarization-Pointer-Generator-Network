An Icelandair pilot gave passengers an extra special view as a short detour was taken to have a closer look at the country's active Bardarbunga volcano.

Luminous lava and smoke were in full view at the pilot took an extra loop for customers to take in.  

'Our pilot made an extra circle around #Bardarbunga this morning to let passengers check it out,' Icelandair posted on Twitter, with thanks to passenger Erla Vinsy for the out-the-window image.

While it's common for a pilot to mention what passengers are seeing out of their respective windows, it's rare for a commercial operator to change course to play the role of a sightseeing facilitator.  

Thousands of earthquakes in the region around Bardarbunga, Iceland's largest volcano, for a number of weeks sparking fears of a repeat of the 2010 ash cloud crisis. 

Over the weekend Iceland's Met Office raised its aviation warning from its second highest level, orange, to the highest, red, as lava shot 70 metres into the air. 

All restrictions have, however, now been lifted with the warning level returned to orange.
