Richard William Fruin was found guilty of committing indecent acts against the three brothers aged eight, 10 and 11

A notorious British paedophile with a history of child abuse in the UK and South East Asia has been sent to prison for two years in Cambodia for sexually assaulting three young boys.

Richard William Fruin, 36, from Gloucestershire was found guilty by Judge Kim Rathnarin of committing indecent acts against the three brothers aged eight, 10 and 11.

Along with his prison sentence, he was fined £600 and ordered to pay £1,500 to the victims' family.

Fruin was working as an English 
teacher at the Universal English School in the Cambodian capital, Phnom 
Penh when he was arrested with one of the boys at a guesthouse in the 
city.

Anti-human-trafficking
 police burst into the Boeung Meas guest house where they found Fruin in
 bed with the eight year old - but he claimed the child was there as a 
young friend and that he had not molested him.

Fruin
 will now join in prison another Briton, 67-year-old David Fletcher, 
from Norwich, who has been convicted of raping a number of children who 
were living in a slum.

Fruin was arrested in the UK in 2005 and charged with 15 counts of producing indecent 
images of children, but skipped bail and fled the country. 

According
 to Action Pour Les Enfants, an anti-paedophile organisation, while on 
the run Fruin travelled to Africa and then to South East Asia before 
returning to Britain in 2012.

Fruin has been charged with molesting the eight-year-old after he was found sleeping with the youngster in this guest house in Phnom Penh

On his return he was re-arrested and sentenced to a year in prison, on completion of which he flew to Cambodia and immediately started work as a teacher.

Cambodia was once the haunt of child molester Gary Glitter

Mr
 Koem Vando, deputy director at the anti-paedophile 
organisation, said: 'Fruin has a history of abuse and the police have 
found many more Cambodian victims.'The
 mother of the boy found with Fruin claimed after the Briton's arrest 
that all three of her sons told police they had been sexually abused by 
him.

According to the 
mother, Fruin had been visiting her roadside shop in Phnom Penh for 
about a month and had previously taken her two older boys to the guest 
house where he was staying.

She said she had no idea that he had evil intent with her sons.

Miss
 Pen Chantha, the guesthouse owner, said she was shocked when police 
raided the room and arrested Fruin while he was in bed with the boy.

Cambodia
 has been the haunt for paedophiles from around the world, among them 
child molester Gary Glitter, who lived there for a time before he fled 
to Vietnam as authorities started closing in on him.

He
 served time in a Vietnamese prison for molesting children before being 
deported to Britain - a fate that awaits Fruin on his eventual release 
from jail.
