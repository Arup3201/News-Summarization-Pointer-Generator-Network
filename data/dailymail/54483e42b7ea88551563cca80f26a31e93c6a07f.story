Farm workers were stunned to be banned from a pub in Britain’s second richest village for not dressing smartly enough, sparking a row over rural life.

Gary Clark and David Dickens each ordered a pint at The Crown in leafy Cookham, Berks, after a hard day’s work.

But staff at the pub, beside the River Thames, refused to serve them.

The pair were asked to leave for wearing casual trousers and polo shirts, featuring the name and logo of the pick your own farm where they work.

Landlord Matt Smith, 32, today said the pub bans tradesmen and labourers in work clothes because they scare off wealthy locals and are bad for business.

The village of Cookham, which has a farming history dating back centuries, and boasts numerous celebrities amongst its residents.

They include England’s World Cup winning rugby coach Sir Clive Woodward, artist Rolf Harris and singer Chris Rea.

A staggering 41 homes in the village sold for over 1 million pounds in the four years to March 2011.

Mr Clark, 44, said: 'Dave and I had just been to visit a friend in hospital after a long day at work and decided to nip into the pub for a quiet pint.

'We were wearing work clothes but they had been covered by our overalls all day and we were clean, so I was stunned when staff told us to leave.

'If we were covered head to toe in dirt I could understand.

'Nobody at the hospital had a problem with our appearance and the pub is open to dog walkers with dirty shoes.

'I was rather taken aback by the way we were told to get out. The man could have been more diplomatic and there was a degree of snobbery about it.

'There were about 50 people inside at the time and the place fell silent - I was really embarrassed because I felt everybody was looking at us as we left.

'I offered to take our drinks outside but the staff insisted we leave.

'The barman said people were not allowed to wear work clothes in the pub but I pointed out people in suits had probably come straight from work.

'Pubs in villages like this used to make their living from those who worked the lands nearby.

'We were forced to get our pint from another pub nearby, which did not mind what we were wearing.'

Mr Clark and Mr Dickens work at Copas Farms, which grows arable crops and pick your own fruit and vegetables in 3,000 acres.

Mr Dickens, 31, said: 'We are quite close to London and a lot of people with money are moving out here.

'It is causing a bit of tension with those that have lived in the village for years and the new arrivals are pushing prices up.

'Traditional village life used to be built on local tradesmen and farm workers.'

The Crown reopened last week after a five month closure and 600,000 pounds refurbishment, which was designed to create a 'lovely country feel'.

The opening was attended by local resident and former children’s television presenter Timmy Mallett.

The pub’s website says: 'At the Crown at Cookham we welcome all visitors, whether stopping off for a pint, a coffee, a light snack, full meal or an overnight stay.'

The menu even has a Ploughman’s Lunch on the menu.

Landlord Mr Smith said the definition of builders clothes is exercised at the discretion of staff and is not a total ban on polo shirts.

He apologised for any upset caused and said staff had dealt with the issue politely.

He added: 'When I took over the pub it was a traditional boozer, where women were not welcome.

'It mainly attracted workers from outside the area and they did not mix with the locals.

'Business was not good and we were at risk of closure so we had to make some changes, which included focusing on food and the local residents.

'Cookham is an affluent village and since we made the changes we have attracted the support of local residents and business is better.

'This is not a class thing, it is just our policy.

'Nightclubs have policies too. You can’t turn up to a nightclub in trainers and scruffy clothes.'

Cookham is said to have inspired Kenneth Grahame to write The Wind in the Willows and the work of English painter Sir Stanley Spencer.
