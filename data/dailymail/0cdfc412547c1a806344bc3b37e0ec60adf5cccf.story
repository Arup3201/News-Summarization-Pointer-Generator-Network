Getting peppered with phone calls while trying to get something done can be very annoying - especially if you're busy robbing a restaurant.

A man was caught on a surveillance camera on Christmas Eve ransacking a scratch-off lottery ticket display case inside the Pastora Restaurant and Pizzeria in The Bronx.

Footage from inside the business on East 167th Street captured the intruder sporting a flashlight mounted on his forehead getting two phone call two minutes apart mid-robbery.

Robbery in progress: This man was caught on a surveillance camera on Christmas Eve ransacking a scratch-off lottery ticket display case in The Bronx 

Hold my calls! The burglary was interrupted by a call that came on the thief's smartphone 

Not in a rush: The brazen perpetrator paused what he was doing to have a brief phone chat 

Each time, the man is seen pulling his smartphone, which appears to be a iPhone, out of his pocket and chatting for a few seconds before hanging up and proceeding with the robbery.

The first phone call comes in at 4.48am as the man is busy rifling through New York State Lottery scratch-off tickets and stuffing them into a plastic bag.

He pulls out his phone, has a brief exchange and pockets it before returning to the task at hand.

At 4.50am, the screen on his phone lights up again, interrupting the robbery for a second time.

Targeted: The robbery happened inside Pastora Restaurant and Pizzeria on East 167th Street in The Bronx

Well equipped: The man broke into the eatery armed with a flashlight mounted on his head 

Ring, ring! Two minutes later, the thief answered his phone a second time 

Chat: The suspect spent a couple of seconds of the phone before hanging up, all the while scanning the display case for more loot 

Wanted: Police released the video hoping to catch the phone-obsessed burglar 

After concluding the conversation, the suspect spends a few more seconds unceremoniously tearing off the lottery tickets of his choice.

With his loot in hand, the man flees the neighborhood restaurant on foot.

The New York Police Department released the minute-long surveillance footage on YouTube last week asking the public to help them locate the suspect.
