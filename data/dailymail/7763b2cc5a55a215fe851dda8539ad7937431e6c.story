The Dallas emergency-room doctor who initially treated a Liberian man infected with Ebola has said he didn't know the man's home country or that he had a 103-degree fever shortly before he left the hospital.

Thomas Eric Duncan was released in the early hours of September 26, about half an hour after his medical records indicate he had a fever that high - a key potential symptom of Ebola, The Dallas Morning News reported.

Dr. Joseph Howard Meier told the newspaper he didn't see that temperature reading on Duncan's medical chart.

'I was unaware of a 103-degree fever,' Meier said in written answers to questions released by his attorney. 'It appears in the chart, but I did not see it.'

Duncan returned to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas two days later in an ambulance and was quickly diagnosed with Ebola. He died October 8.

Duncan's sister and fiancee have said he told medical staff in the emergency room during that first visit that he was from Liberia, though the hospital's medical records only indicate Duncan said he was from Africa, The Dallas Morning News reported.

'I have a general recollection of Mr. Duncan, but I don’t recall the specifics of our discussions,' Meier told the newspaper, answering a question about if he spoke to Duncan regarding travel history. 'However, I routinely pair the recent travel question with the sick contact question so it is likely that I did so in this instance.'

The hospital has already acknowledged mistakes in its care of Duncan and said its records system previously didn't make a patient's travel history clear, the newspaper pointed out.

Duncan's case set off a scramble by authorities to monitor dozens of people who potentially had contact with him, including in the days after his release from the hospital. None of those people ended up testing positive for Ebola. Two Presbyterian nurses were infected while treating him, but have since recovered.

In his written responses to The Dallas Morning News, Meier also said 'As medical professionals we aspire to perfection in the diagnosis and treatment of all our patients and have regrets when an incorrect diagnosis occurs.'

'It’s very easy to make a diagnosis of any condition after the patient’s medical evaluation confirms the final diagnosis,' he said. 'Unfortunately, such 20/20 hindsight is not available to medical professionals caring for patients in real time.'

Meier said 'If [Duncan] told me he came from Liberia, this would have prompted me to contact the CDC and begin an evaluation for Ebola, but the likelihood would have still been low since Mr. Duncan denied any sick contacts.'

But he was less sure about the 103-degree reading.

'Given what little information I had, a 103 temperature would most likely not have helped with the diagnosis of Ebola,' Meier said. 'Although, if it did not quickly improve, he could have possibly been admitted to the hospital.'

Asked about whether he would do anything differently, Meier told The Dallas Morning News that 'Hindsight is always 20/20 so it’s virtually impossible to answer this question. Based on the information I had at the time, I believe that the care and treatment were appropriate.'
