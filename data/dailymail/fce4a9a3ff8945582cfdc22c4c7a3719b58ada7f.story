California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer of California said Thursday in a YouTube video that she won't run for re-election in 2016, sparking immediate discussions about an arms race among Golden State liberals to succeed her.

A fearless backer of abortion rights, gun control and environmental regulation, Boxer boasted that 'I have about a thousand accomplishments' 

First elected to Congress in 1983 and sent to the Senate ten years later, the 74-year-old Boxer told supporters in the brief video that she doesn't feel old. 

'I feel as young as I did when I got elected,' Boxer claimed.

But she would have been 82 if she had won and completed a fifth consecutive Senate term.

'WHAT?' House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was shocked to learn from a reporter that her fellow California liberal lioness was calling it quits

'I am never going to retire. The work is too important. But I will not be running for the Senate in 2016,' Boxer said.

She has said previously that she is proudest of the vote she cast against the war in Iraq during the George W. Bush presidency. 

Leading Democrats now expected to contend for her seat include Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, Attorney General Kamala Harris and Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom.

Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg has also been long-rumored as eyeing the seat.

Sandberg was chief of staff to Treasury Sec. Larry Summers when Bill Clinton was president, and could fund her own U.S. Senate race without missing the money.

With Boxer out of the race, at least, Hillary Clinton would be free of the angst-inducing endorsement choice between her old political ally and one of her husband's former advisers. 

The renewed energy surrounding a hotly contested Senate primary could create problems for Democrats, however.

In California's 'jungle primary' system, the top two vote-getters advance to a runoff in the general election regardless of their party.

While that could mean an expensive and divisive two-Democrat slug fest in November 2016, it could also present an opportunity for Republican challengers if too many liberals enter the race and find their votes split.

NOT RUNNING: 2010 Republican Senate candidate Carly Fiorina said through a spokeswoman that she has no intention of making a second bid for Boxer's U.S. Senate seat

GOP candidates could wind up in both of the top slots if only two ran and a more fractured Democratic field included five or more hopefuls. 

Boxer is best known in California as an environmentalist warrior, writing and passing laws that reclassified more than 1 million acres of land there as 'wilderness,' a designation that bans motor vehicles, new roads and all mining.

She also led efforts to prevent oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. 

But her most memorable moment on Capitol Hill was a momentary gender-politics flare-up involving U.S. Army General Michael Walsh – who called her 'ma'am' during a 2009 Senate hearing.

'Do me a favor,' she interrupted. 'Can you say "senator" instead of "ma'am"?' 

'It’s just a thing. I worked so hard to get that title, so I’d appreciate it. Thank you.'

Gen. Walsh quickly obliged – 'Yes, senator.'

In the military, regulations require addressing superiors – including members of Congress – as 'ma'am' or 'sir.' But among feminists the term 'ma'am' it can be seen as demeaning or patronizing.

Elaine Donnelly, president of the Center for Military Readiness, told the Washington Times the following day that Boxer was 'embarrassing herself by showing hypersensitivity and insecurity that is unbecoming to a United States senator.'

'I've always been suspicious of women who are insulted by pronouns,' Donnelly jabbed. 

The episode became political grist during the 2010 election, when parody filmmaker David Zucker – of 'Airplane!' fame – made an online ad mocking her.

The 2-minute spot included everyone from Indian chiefs and nuns to Eagle scouts and surgeons insisting on being called by their proper titles.

'We've called her "senator" for 20 years,' the ad's voiceover intoned. 'It's time to call her "ma'am" again.'

Boxer bested former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina by 10 points to win re-election.

Fiorina spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores told DailyMail.com that she won't be running in California again.

The one-time candidate has 'called Virginia home since 2011 to be near her grandkids,' Flores said. 'She and Frank also lived in virginia for 7 years in the 1980s.'

FIorina is, however, scheduled to appear at the Iowa Freedom Summit on January 24, fueling rumors of presidential aspirations. 

People close to fIrebrand GOP Rep. Darrell Issa and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, both Californians, told reporters on Thursday that neither will run for the open Senate seat next year.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a fellow California Democrat, was visibly shocked on Thursday when a reporter asked her about Boxer's retirement during a regular weekly press briefing.

The news had broken while Pelosi was at the podium taking questions.

'What?' she asked.

Pelosi said the senator had phoned her office during the morning but she never took the call.

'She called, she wanted to talk to me personally. I thought she wanted to have dinner tonight,' Pelosi chuckled.

She said Boxer's retirement 'will be a great loss to the United States, the people of California and, the country.'

Boxer's popularity among Californians has been on a downward slide for the past few years. One September 2014 poll from the Public Policy Institute of California put her approval rating at just 41 per cent.

Dianne Feinstein, California's senior senator, praised Boxer's 'hard work in support of women and families, the environment, human rights and her tireless efforts to modernize our country’s infrastructure.'

'She is never one to shy away from any challenge, and I can’t thank her enough for being such a resilient collaborator,' Sen. Feinstein said in a statement. 'We blazed many trails together, and now I’m eager to see where her next steps take her.'
