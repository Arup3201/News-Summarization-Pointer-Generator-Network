As the players retreated to the pavilion in dwindling light, it was clear that one Test team had again increased its standing on day one at The Oval. 

Australia.

What a job they did on England in the winter, that Alastair Cook and his colleagues should have made such hard work of these Indian tourists this summer. 

How did Cook nearly lose his job, and his marbles, to this lot? How were England staring at a series defeat coming out of that second Test at Lord’s? 

Australia really did a number on England in the last Ashes series. 

Shaken: Alastair Cook and England have made hard work of the five-Test series against India this summer

Stirred: Australia did such a number on England that their confidence was shaken going up against India

It has taken them to here, almost, to recover their confidence and swagger. India’s failed attempt to wage disciplinary war on James Anderson after Trent Bridge appears to have united England and, in doing so, healed some of the wounds of the winter. 

Until that point, Australia had rendered England vulnerable and meek, their captain a shell of himself, even the younger members of the squad catching the fear that seemed to pervade the dressing-room at the first hint of crisis.

Some fragility remains. England are still at risk from a tail-end with its dander up and in the last two years have given up 50 runs or more to the 10th-wicket partnership on eight occasions. 

So it was here. The stand between India’s captain MS Dhoni and the returning fast bowler Ishant Sharma was worth 58 from 98 balls, the most successful Indian pairing of the day by a margin of 34. 

England seem unable to get the job finished under pressure — a remnant, perhaps, of a similar failing in the back-to-back Ashes series.

There is no doubt Australia hurt them and one wonders in what direction this series would have swung had their opponents been made of sterner stuff. As it is, India have lived down to the national stereotype, lousy tourists lacking the appetite for the challenge presented by a five-Test series.

Increasingly, there is a disconnect between these countries. In England, the Test is valued above all, the one-day game a lucrative sideshow. Yet Indian cricketers are revered through the IPL competition, and the limited overs internationals are the only ones that now fill stadiums to capacity and beyond.

Some think India will be more engaged this summer once the long-form fixtures are done. What a pity.

It makes the events of July, when England struggled so pitifully, ever more mysterious. England bowled extremely well on Friday— as impressively as they have done in this campaign — yet without doubt India have lost their edge. 

‘Believe me, they are not this bad,’ Sunil Gavaskar wailed during his commentary, as wickets fell with alarming regularity. Yet they are. Any team that loses its focus is precisely this bad.

And England lost their way in Australia this winter. Battered into submission, they became every bit as clueless as India were on Friday, a malaise that has taken close to six months to shake off. They are coming out of the slump now, slowly. 

Chris Jordan opened his first spell with two wicket maidens, the first time an England bowler has made that happen since Monty Panesar against Pakistan in 2006.

In the circumstances, then, the innings played by Dhoni in defiance of England’s bowlers was a small wonder. It can be argued that he should be doing more as captain to inspire this squad, but his performance with the bat on Friday was the definition of resistance.

Chris Jordan's two wicket maidens was an England bowler's first since Monty Panesar over Pakistan in 2006

Dhoni made 82 in a total score of 148, the first time an Indian captain has been responsible for more than 50 per cent of his team’s total. 

His ally, Sharma, made just seven in a stand of 58. Sharma rode his luck, as did India, dropped by Ian Bell just five balls into his innings with the score on 95. 

Had India failed to make three figures, however, there really could have been no complaints, but then The Oval crowd would have missed Dhoni’s knock which included 15 fours, plus a six off the mercurial Jordan.

The sight of his team-mates playing like men with scarce interest in the art of Test batting only put Dhoni’s achievement in sharper relief. He was the sole Indian batsman who played as if not ticking off the days to Heathrow’s departure lounge. 

Strange, considering India have close to three weeks of one-day cricket remaining when the final Test is over.

Proud: MS Dhoni looks like one of the few Indian batsmen that doesn't have his eyes fixed on Heathrow yet

This was the match in which Jimmy Anderson could realistically overtake Sir Ian Botham’s record of 383 Test wickets. He began the game on 376, needing only eight in two innings to be crowned England’s greatest bowler (although, as Botham archly observed, that still leaves him 15 Test centuries shy of true parity).

When Anderson claimed the wicket of Gautam Gambhir after just four balls of play, it appeared the milestone could be on — certainly over two innings — but India, too willing to give up their wickets, soon dashed that hope. 

Anderson’s quest was quickly hampered by a fairer division of the spoils with Stuart Broad (two), Jordan (three) and Chris Woakes (three) all successful. Anderson picked up the spare.

As England’s opening partnership steered a way past India’s 10th-wicket benchmark of 58, the narrative became increasingly familiar.

Given the meagre nature of India’s score they needed to send England to bed two or three wickets down, but there is no Mitchell Johnson to inspire fear and an early breakthrough.

India will claim they were cursed by misfortune when Cook looked to be out lbw to Bhuvneshwar Kumar with the score on 20. The appeal was rejected, much to Kumar’s fury, yet with no DRS to correct errors, India simply had to live with it. This is not the first time Cook has benefited from a little luck in this Test series.

By next summer, he could be back to his best. He will need to be. Australia are here again, and they are better than this bunch; either of them, on the evidence of the passing summer.

Help: Anderson shared the wicket spoils with Stuart Broad (two), Jordan (three) and Chris Woakes (three)

Record in sight: Anderson needs six more in order to overtake Sir Ian Botham’s record of 383 Test wickets
