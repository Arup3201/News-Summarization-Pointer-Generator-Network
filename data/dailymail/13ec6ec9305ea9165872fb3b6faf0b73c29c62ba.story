Fighting for life: Ryan Hooley fractured his skull in five places when he fell between floors at the discount clothes chain's Nottingham store at around 2pm yesterday

A six-year-old boy is fighting for his life in hospital after plunging 35 feet from an escalator while shopping at Primark.

Ryan Hooley
fractured his skull in five places yesterday when he fell between floors at the discount clothes chain's Nottingham store during the busy lunchtime rush.

The youngster, from the city's Beeston area, was rushed by paramedics to Queens's Medical Centre after the accident where doctors have placed him in an induced coma.

Nottinghamshire Police said the the city's council has launched an investigation into the accident alongside The Health and Safety Executive.

A spokesman for the Queens's Medical Centre, in Nottingham, described Ryan's state as critical but stable.

Ryan's parents Kate and Andrew, who were at his bedside today, told how a routine shopping trip turned to a 'nightmare'.

Ryan Hooley's parents, Kate and Andrew Hooley, are keeping a vigil at their son's bedside at Nottingham's Queens Medical Centre.

Kate said: 'It was a nice day out with the kids, I took them shopping, and was going to get something for dinner when I took a detour through Primark.

'He was there one second, and gone the next. It's your worst nightmare come true.'

Andrew said: 'I think there could definitely be better safety especially for the rails up on the first floor.

'They could be a lot higher than they are at the minute, a lot, lot higher, and a lot safer.'

The boy's uncle said: '[Kate and Andrew] were originally told by doctors to expect the worst. Ryan's condition is extremely serious and doctors have induced a coma.

'He's suffered five fractures to his skull. We are expecting to hear more in the next few hours'

The uncle, who did not want to be named but has spent nine years in the army, added: 'It's perhaps surprising Ryan hasn't suffered more broken bones, I have worked at height before and known people die falling less distance.

'It's thought perhaps Ryan landed on clothes racks in the store which may have soften his fall instead of him going straight onto a hard floor.'

His uncle said police had been in 
touch with Andrew and doctors had told him Ryan could be taken out of 
the coma within 24 to 48 hours.

He said: 'I have been to that Primark
store and rode the escalators as an adult, but obviously not as a 
child. I know there will be CCTV in the store and we are just trying to 
work out what happened to Ryan.

A woman, who did not want to be 
named, said: 'I saw him fall from one floor to another and he landed on 
some clothes rails. It was awful.'

Another shopper said: 'I could clearly see one woman sat on the floor, screaming and crying.'

An ambulance service spokesman said the boy was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre with head injuries.

A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark's Nottingham store closed early following an incident in the store.

'The safety of our customers in our 
stores is of paramount concern to us. We are now working with the 
relevant authorities to investigate this incident.'

A
Nottingham City Council spokesman said: 'We have been notified of an 
accident at Primark and, as health and safety in retail premises is 
overseen by councils, our health and safety officers are investigating 
the circumstances. We are unable to say anything further at this stage.'

Serious condition: A spokesman for the Queens's Medical Centre, in Nottingham, where Ryan is being cared for, described Ryan's state as critical but stable

This was not the first time a child has been injured falling from an escalator in Primark.

In 2008, three-year-old Elsie Parry fell 100 feet after she reached the second floor of the Primark shop in Liverpool.

The little girl is thought to have slipped though a gap in a 'glass wall' at the top of the department store escalator, plummeting to the basement floor as horrified shoppers looked on.

She suffered a number of injuries including a broken arm and leg, a ruptured spleen and liver, fractured ribs, a cracked skull and a brain haemorrhage.

Since the accident she has made a full recovery and returned, but not before she learned to walk again.
