As Carole Middleton arrived at Wimbledon today it was easy to see where her daughters Kate and Pippa get their good looks from.

The mother-of-three belied her 58 years as she strolled through the grounds in an eye-catching bright blue dress with a cropped white blazer.

Although she's set to become a grandmother next month, she could have passed for the older sister of her pregnant daughter with her fresh face and brunette hair.

She also proved once again she shares her daughter's fashion sense as she wore the same nude LK Bennett court shoes Pippa and Kate are fond of wearing.

Along with her husband, Michael, 64, she then took a seat in the royal box on centre court to enjoy the championship tennis.

She was joined there by an array of famous faces including presenter Bruce Forsyth and double Olympic champion Mo Farah.

Carole looked to be having a whale of a time as she shared a joke with actor Alessandro Nivola and tried to beat Mo to catch a tennis ball hit into the box from the court during the first match.

Carole has passed her love of the game on to her three children who are all avid fans of the sport and Pippa is also a keen player.

Earlier in the month she joined Pippa to watch Andy Murray play in the Queen's tournament.

But she wasn't joined by any of her off spring today as Pippa, 29, and James, 26, had been in the royal box on Monday to see the first day of play which included Roger Federer and Andy Murray's first round matches. The Duchess of Cambridge is not expected to attend this year as she is currently heavily pregnant.

The Middletons were able too see a bumper crop of world class tennis players as they watched Eugenie Bouchard defeat Ana Ivanovic and then charismatic Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga against Ernests Gulbis.

They will then be able to see Federer in action as he takes on Sergiy Stakhovsky later today on centre court but they will not see Britain's number one player as Murray will play on court one.

Carole will soon become the grandmother to the heir to the throne when her daughter gives birth and is expected to be present at the labour in the private Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington West London, where Prince William was born in 1982.

Sources told the Daily Mail last week that Kate, 31, is particularly keen to have the support of her family around her because father-to-be William, also 31, may be on duty in North Wales, where he is still working as a Search and Rescue pilot at RAF Valley on Anglesey, when the baby arrives.

She's been spotted shopping for baby products with the Duchess on numerous occasions as the excitement builds for her first grandchild - who might been seen at Wimbledon themselves in years to come if the family passion for tennis is passed on.
