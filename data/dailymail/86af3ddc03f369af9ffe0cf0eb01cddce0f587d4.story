Mankind is on the brink of 'committing suicide on a grand scale' unless rapid progress is made on green issues, the Prince of Wales warned today.

In very strong language, Prince Charles claimed the planet was doomed to an 'unimaginable future' if the problems of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere, intensive farming using pesticides and the depletion of natural resources were not addressed.

The Prince, often accused of using his position to influence public policy, is usually tempered when giving his views about the environment.

But in an apocalyptic warning of the toxic planet facing future generations, he claimed the world was heading towards a 'terrifying point of no return'.

Letters: Prince Charles has often written to ministers and Whitehall departments

In a swipe at critics of his green views, he said he had once been written off as 'a crank', but now his fears for the environment have been backed by scientific evidence.

His comments came in a pre-recorded video speech accepting a lifetime achievement award at the  7th International Green Awards at Battersea Power Station in London.

He told the ceremony that fossil fuels and supplies of fresh water were under pressure while 'vast amounts of CO2' were still pumped into the atmosphere.

The Prince said: 'Humanity and the Earth will soon begin to suffer some very grim consequence.

'It’s therefore an act of suicide on a grand scale to ride so roughshod over those checks and balances and flout nature’s necessary limits as blatantly as we do.

“The longer we go on ignoring what is already happening and denying what will happen in the future, the more profoundly we condemn our grandchildren and their children to an unbearably toxic and unstable existence. We simply have to turn the tide.'

Speaking of his early warnings of the environmental threats to the planet he said the lifetime achievement award was an acknowledgement for what he described as his 'rather inadequate efforts' to create change.

He added: 'All those years ago when I began to 
see that this could be so, I found myself labelled with every term that 
describes a crank.

“I
 don’t actually recommend it as a pastime but, extraordinary as it may 
seem, nowadays … that intuitive feeling has been backed up by a mass of 
scientific evidence in every possible field confirming that our 
predominant approach is having a very adverse effect on nature.'

Over the years, the Prince has courted controversy because of his involvement in public affairs - writing to councils and government ministers with his views ranging from architecture to alternative medicine.

The government has blocked the release of secret letters Prince of Wales wrote to ministers because they would 'seriously damage' his political neutrality and his role as future king.

The letters were requested under the Freedom of Information Act, but yesterday the attorney general stopped the release saying they were 'particularly frank' and 
would 'potentially have undermined his position of political neutrality'
if published.

He added
 that any suggestion he was 'disagreeing with government policy' would 
be 'seriously damaging to his role as future monarch'.

The High Court had previously ruled that
two dozen ‘black spider’ letters – which Charles sent during 
the last Labour government – should be revealed.

A
 judge said it was in the public interest to release the letters, which 
were described in court as ‘advocacy correspondence’ through which the 
Prince of Wales had sought to influence government policy.

But yesterday the Government’s chief legal officer overturned the ruling.

Last month the government blocked the release of secret letters Prince Charles wrote to ministers because they would 'seriously damage' his political neutrality and his role as future king.

The letters were requested under the Freedom of Information Act, but the Attorney General Dominic Grieve stopped the release saying they were 'particularly frank' and would 'potentially have undermined his position of political neutrality' if published.

The High Court had previously ruled that two dozen ‘black spider’ letters – which Charles sent during the last Labour government – should be revealed.

A judge said it was in the public interest to release the letters, which were described in court as ‘advocacy correspondence’ through which the Prince of Wales had sought to influence government policy.

In 2009, he was accused of meddling in government policy after it emerged he had written to eight Whitehall departments in three years.

He sent personal letters to the Treasury, the Foreign Office and the Education Department – while his aides sent letters to other senior Cabinet members.

Freedom of Information requests revealed advisers to the Prince pressed ministers to consider his views on matters including hospital building and the design of ecotowns

His most public intervention came in 2010 over a £3 billion scheme to redevelop the Chelsea Royal Barracks by the Qataris.

The project was axed after the Prince lobbied the Prime Minister of Qatar claiming it was a 'gigantic experiment with the very soul of our city'.

Dr Benny Peiser, director of Lord Lawson’s Global Warming Policy Foundation, told the Independent that the Prince’s views were still out of step with mainstream thinking.
