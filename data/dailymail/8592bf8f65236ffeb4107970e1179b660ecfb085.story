When Christina Beckett learned that her husband had accidentally misplaced an SD card containing irreplaceable pictures of their newborn son, she was certain she would never see them again.

'I was heartbroken,' the young mother from Virginia tearfully said, recalling the moment a few weeks ago when her husband, Chris, told her he had inadvertently slipped the SD card into a videogame case and later traded the game in.

Mrs Beckett, of Newport News, was devastated by the loss because the memory card contained photos documenting the first two months of their son Peyton's life, including him on the scales immediately after delivery and photos of Christina cradling him in her arms for the first time.

Fail: Chris and Christina Beckett were certain they would never see their son's first photos after the husband accidentally misplaced them  

Oops: Chris Beckett, of Virginia, inadvertently slipped an SD card containing photos of his newborn son inside an Xbox videogame case

Irreplaceable: The memory card contained photos covering the first two months of Peyton Beckett's life 

Slip-up: Beckett has traded in the videogame at this Gamestop store in Newport News, not realizing the camera chip was still inside 

Chris Beckett explained that he had purchased the Xbox game Destiny and unthinkingly tucked the memory card from the couple's camera behind a tab inside the case.

Earlier this month, Beckett took the videogame down to the Gamestop store at the Jefferson Commons mall and traded it on, unaware that the memory card with the precious baby pictures was still inside.

‘I just kept saying, “I can’t believe you did this, I can’t believe you did this,”’ Christina told NewsChannel3 last week.

The new mother raced to the game store in her pajamas that night to try and track down the Xbox game while her husband was busy tearing apart their home in search of the SD card.

But all of their efforts were in vain: the illusive chip was nowhere to be found.

After exhausting all possible avenues of locating the card, the Becketts offered a $200 reward to the person who returns their misplaced SD card.

And just in time for Christmas, the Becketts received the good news: their precious photos have been recovered.

Reunited: Two days before Christmas, Christina Beckett was contacted by Zach Zimmerman (right) telling him he was the one who had purchased the traded-in game with their SD card 

Happy end: Mrs BEckett handed the Good Samaritan a $200 reward for coming forward 

New life: Among the photos found on the recovered card was this image of newborn Peyton immediately after delivery

Christmas miracle: Christina Beckett said having the photos of her son back in her possession is the perfect Christmas gift 

The couple were contacted this week by Zach Zimmerman, a gamer who had purchased Chris Beckett’s traded-in Xbox game.

Zimmerman said he noticed at once the memory card tucked behind a tab, but then completely forgot about it until he saw NewsChannel 3's report about the Becketts’ lost pictures.

On Tuesday, an overjoyed Christina Beckett met with Zimmerman at the Gamestop store and was at last reunited with the illusive card.

‘I could not have asked for a better Christmas gift.’ Beckett gushed.

A grateful Zach Zimmerman claimed his $200 reward, telling Mrs Beckett that she has just doubled his income, and that now he will be able to buy Christmas presents.
