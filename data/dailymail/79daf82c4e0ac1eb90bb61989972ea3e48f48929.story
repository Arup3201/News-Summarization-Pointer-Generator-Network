Tottenham continued a happy pattern of results with Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen both scoring again to heap more misery on Nigel Pearson’s Leicester, who have now gone 13 games without a win.

Walthamstow’s finest and the man from Middelfart, Denmark, have scored one apiece in three of Spurs’ last four Barclays Premier League away games, going on to win 2-1 each time. As the sequence often goes, Kane scores, then Eriksen seals all three points — even on occasions like this when Spurs possibly don’t deserve it.

It happened at Hull first, then Swansea and this game unfolded accordingly with Kane netting the opener before Leonardo Ulloa grabbed one back for the home side. But midfielder Eriksen popped up to secure a fourth consecutive top-flight win for Spurs.

‘I’m very happy for them both,’ said manager Mauricio Pochettino. ‘They are playing with the confidence to run free and shoot. I’m happy for the team, too. It was a very important three points from a difficult game.’ 

For vast swathes of the second half Leicester dominated but lacked a final devastating touch. Pearson, whose side are now six points from safety, is aware of the ominous statistic that only two sides have escaped relegation after being bottom at Christmas. He was Bryan Robson’s assistant in 2005 when West Bromwich Albion secured Premier League survival on the final day of the season, a feat since nicknamed the Great Escape.

‘It’s not Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, there’s no one answer,’ said Pearson this week after being asked what Leicester needed to do to avoid relegation. He might first look at bolstering his strike force.

‘I’m not digging my head in the sand, we’re in trouble,’ he said. ‘But performances like this would suggest we have capabilities to turn things around. We certainly had them defending pretty desperately at times. I’m loath to play the bad-luck card, but we are close to making things happen.’

Kane did not bowl anyone over with his ability when he spent a short time at Leicester in 2013. The striker spent the majority of his loan spell watching from the bench, scoring just twice in three months.

It took only 58 seconds for him to prove to the King Power Stadium crowd he is much improved since then. Now a focal point of Tottenham’s campaign, the 21-year-old’s opener in the first minute was his 15th in 23 games. Only Sergio Aguero boasts more this season.

Kane, who was heavily taunted by Foxes fans, looked like a player riding on the wave of confidence when Nacer Chadli’s ball found him in the box inside one minute. He controlled with his right foot and slotted it past Ben Hamer with his left.

But he was left holding his head in his hands just before half time when he missed a gilt-edged opportunity to as good as seal all three points for his side, wasting a free header from six yards out by somehow steering the ball wide of the post.

His opposite number Ulloa could sympathise — the Argentine failed to capitalise on two good chances in the first half. First Danny Drinkwater slotted a neat ball through but the striker wasted a delicate first touch by scuffing his effort well wide. Then Riyad Mahrez played a pinpoint ball into the six-yard box, but Ulloa’s diving header bounced off the inside of the post. 

Ulloa finally got the leveller in the 49th minute, after a ball into the box by Mahrez. There was justice for Ulloa, who was being grabbed around his chest by Federico Fazio. Despite that, Ulloa managed to direct the ball past Hugo Lloris at the near post.

It looked like Mahrez, who was probably Leciester’s best player, might put his side ahead when his sweetly struck dipping free-kick from 22 yards out evaded the wall but bounced off the crossbar.

Eriksen popped up with the winner in the 70th minute. Kane won a free-kick on the left-hand side of the box and Eriksen’s curling effort bounced awkwardly and sneaked past Hamer at the near post.

Mahrez troubled Spurs again in the 88th minute when his superb effort saw Lloris palm the ball into the path of Jeffrey Schlupp, who couldn’t get his shot away. Mahrez and Schlupp were excellent but Pearson is without both for six weeks when they are away for the Africa Cup of Nations.

Another blow for the struggling manager.
