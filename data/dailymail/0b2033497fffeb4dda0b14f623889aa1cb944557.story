Hyundai has been forced to remove an advert for one of its cars showing a man attempting to commit suicide after outraged customers complained to the company.

The Korean automaker said the ad was posted in an effort to 'get consumers feedback'.

The commercial showed a man shutting himself in his car and trying to take his own life by suffocating himself.

Bad taste: Hyundai has been forced to apologise for an advert trying to promote the zero carbon emissions of one of its cars by featuring a man failing to commit suicide

The aim of the short film was to promote the hydrogen fuel call car's water emissions of one of Hyundai's vehicles.

The emissions released by the car are water as opposed to the carbon monoxide released by petrol engines, which is potentially lethal if inhaled.

In the world of advertising, there's a fine line between the creative and the insensitive.

Hyundai has released several apology statements.

'Hyundai Motor deeply and sincerely apologizes for the offensive viral film. The ad was created by an affiliate advertising agency, Innocean Europe, without Hyundai’s request or approval. The film runs counter to our values as a company and as members of the community. We are very sorry for any offense or distress the video caused. More to the point, Hyundai apologizes to those who have been personally impacted by tragedy.' Hyundai said in a statement.

A separate statement was also released by the company in North America:

'We at Hyundai Motor America are shocked and saddened by the depiction of a suicide attempt in an inappropriate European video featuring a Hyundai. Suicide merits thoughtful discussion, not this type of treatment.'

BlatAnt: The commercial makes it clear that the man intended to kill himself by breathing in the exhaust fumes from his car

Failed: The advert ends with the man getting out of his vehicle and returning inside having failed to kill himself

The company has said the commercial never appeared on the company website or their own YouTube channel.

The advert has since been removed from YouTube and MailOnline is not showing the video.

The commercial for the ix35 commercial was called 'Pipe Job'.

The ad ends with an exterior shot of the house as the garage lights turn on and the door opens.

The Future? The advert was supposed to showcase Hyundai's new ix35 Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV), the first hydrogen-powered fuel cell car

As he walks back inside, his suicide attempt apparently unsuccessful, the tagline reads 'The ix35 with 100 per cent water emissions' appears on the screen.

The one-minute video was made by a German ad agency Innocean. The firm has also released a statement justifying their cause:

'This viral film was created and posted on Youtube for one day by Innocean Worldwide Europe to  get consumers’ feedback on creative idea employing hyperbole to dramatize a product advantage without any other commercial purpose.'

Although many have criticised the company for being insensitive, at least one commentator on YouTube pointed out the effectiveness of the advertisement’s message.

'I know how controversial this advert is
becoming and whether you agree with it or not it’s worked,' the comment
read. 'You cannot deny that. The job is done and everyone now knows 
about the new Hyundai with 100 percent water emissions. Advertising at 
its best.'

Shifting the blame: Hyundai say the advert for its Hyundai's hydrogen-powered car was produced by an outside ad agency

Hyundai has apologized and pulled an ad that portrayed a man trying to commit suicide. The video was made by a German ad agency and was supposed to advertise the company's new hydrogen-powered vehicles.

Holly Brockwell, who identified herself as a digital copywriter in London, wrote on her blog that she felt 'sick' after watching the advert, saying her father had committed suicide when she was a child.

'I understand better than most people the need to do... something talkable, even something outrageous to get those all-important viewing figures. What I don't understand is why a group of strangers have just brought me to tears in order to sell me a car,' she said in an open letter to Hyundai and Innocean.

'My dad never drove a Hyundai. Thanks to you, neither will I.'
