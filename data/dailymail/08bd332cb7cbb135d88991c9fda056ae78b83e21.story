Elisabeth Hasselbeck did not show up for her co-hosting duties on Fox & Friends on Wednesday after undergoing surgery on Tuesday.

Her co-host Steve Doocy told viewers Hasselbeck, 37, would be M.I.A. for a while, but he failed to disclose what why she required an operation.

'In case you were wondering where Elisabeth is today and this week, well, she had some surgery yesterday and she's going to be out for a couple of weeks,' Doocy said.

Mystery surgery: Elisabeth Hasselbeck was conspicuously absent from Fox & Friends on Wednesday

Fox called Hasselbeck's surgical procedure 'a private matter.' 

In the former The View host's place Wednesday was Fox News' Kimberly Guilfoyle.

Another of Hasselbeck's Fox co-hosts, Brian Kilmeade, seemed confident she'd recover quickly from the unknown ailment.

'She is strong, she is tough, and a better athlete than me,' Kilmeade said. 'We heard from her last night and she said she is feeling good. So, in a short time, she'll be back on the set.'

Fox News reps told The Wrap:  

'Elisabeth has asked for all to respect her wishes for privacy in regards to further details at this time.'

She finished fourth and was soon chosen to host the Style Network's The Look For Less in 2002.

The following year, she rose to stardom when she was hired at age 26 to co-host The View.

She's moved on to Fox in 2013.
