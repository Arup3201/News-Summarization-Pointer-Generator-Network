The burgundy-coloured splatter wouldn't look out of place at another of Catalan city Sitges' famed events, a yearly international film festival specialising in horror and fantasy.

But there's nothing to fear about this Barefoot Grape Crushing Competition, which ran on Sunday as part of the 53rd Annual Sitges Wine Festival, or Festa de La Verema, which celebrates the annual harvest.

The squishing of grapes in front of a historic church has been a pivotal part of the Spanish festival's programme for 36 years as groups of locals ditch their shoes and produce the raw material for their signature drop.

The Penedes region produces about 90 per cent of the world's cava and while not all of the grapes are squashed in this ancient manner, the locals are certainly adept at extracting all of the juice possible from their grapes.

Teams compete with a duo together in a wooden half barrel doing the stomping - otherwise known as the fun bit - while another member squeezes the crushed grapes with their hands over a wire mesh to ensure every last drop of the previous liquid is liberated.

The winning team is simply the one to produce the most juice.

Potentially not the most politically correct of festivals, other events include a beauty competition and the weighing of the heir and heiress of the event using wine bottles. 

Sitges is 35km from Barcelona and before the economic boom in the 1960s turned it into a popular tourist resort, the area's primary industry was wine.

Other events include barrel rolling contests and the best of the regions food is showcased, with local restaurants changing their menus to the more grape focused than usual.
