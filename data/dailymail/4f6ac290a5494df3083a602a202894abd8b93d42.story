Police suspect that the driver of the tragic crash that killed three people on Sunday may have been distracted by a family member when the accident happened. 

Darren and Susana Milne were driving with their two sons in a silver Toyota station wagon heading north on Enterprise Drive at Berkeley Vale on the NSW Central Coast on Sunday afternoon when the car veered off the road and hit a tree. 

Darren, 42, Susana, 39, and their seven-year-old son died in the crash. The boy’s older brother, 11, was flown to The Children’s Hospital at Westmead and is in a critical condition. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Inspector Colin Lott of the Tuggerah Lakes Local Area Command said Mr Milne could have been distracted when the car veered off the road.

The car did not appear to brake as it veered off the road and slammed into a tree. He said the most likely cause of the crash was inattention.

‘It was not a savage turn and the car was only a few metres off the road,’ Inspector Lott said. ‘Most likely the driver turned to speak to the children.’

A NSW police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia that any claims that Mr Milne was distracted by a family member while he was driving was 'just speculation'.

'That the driver was distracted by one of his family is just one possibility. The investigation is still ongoing,' the police spokeswoman said.

Witnesses told police the car was travelling between 90 and 100km/h when the crash took place.

7 News reports doctors are working to save the life of a Sydney boy and whether he pulls through, he will be have to deal with the shocking reality that the crash claimed the rest of his family. 

'It's always a difficult scene for any fatality but to see potentially a whole family lost makes it even more distressing,' Inspector Lott said.

Insp Lott said crash investigators would check the vehicle to ensure there was no mechanical failure prior to the accident.
