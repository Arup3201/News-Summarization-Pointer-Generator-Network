England players past and present have lavished praise on Rooney ahead of his 100th cap, including the captain he has succeeded, Steven Gerrard. 

‘I think it would be fully deserved for a player of his calibre and for what he’s done for Manchester United even though it kills me saying it,’ Gerrard told ITV Sport.

‘He’s taken that onto the international stage and he’s been consistent with goals and performances.

‘In years to come anyone who is looking back at records and looks at goals and caps, Wayne Rooney’s name will come up and I think he deserves both accolades.’

Stewart Downing was the only absentee on Friday.

The West Ham midfielder took a knock in Thursday's session and was rested as a precaution by head coach Roy Hodgson, but is expected to be available for the Wembley clash.

Hodgson, who lost midfielders Michael Carrick and Andros Townsend to injury earlier this week, had no other squad members sitting out the final session at St George's Park on Friday before the team head south to the capital.
