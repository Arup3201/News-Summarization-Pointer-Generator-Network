Boots is to start selling e-cigarettes from next week.

The high street chemist will stock the brand Puritane, made by a subsidiary of Imperial Tobacco.

A spokesperson for Boots said: 'From listening to our customers, we also
 know many people are looking for access to an alternative to smoking, 
such as e- cigarettes.

'From 24 February 2014 we will begin selling a high-quality, safety 
reviewed and rigorously tested e-cigarette called Puritane to people 
aged 18 and over.'

Boots says it is working with the Imperial Tobacco subsidiary Fontem Ventures, which it's claimed operates separately from the tobacco firm.

It has spent two years working with Fontem to develop 'a high quality (pharmaceutical grade nicotine), safety reviewed and rigorously tested e-cigarette'.

The e-cigarette will cost £7.99 for a disposable version and £22.99 for the starter kit which contains a battery, a charger and two cartomisers.

An e-cigarette contains three components: a battery, an atomiser and a cartridge containing nicotine suspended in propylene glycol and water.

When the user sucks on the e-cigarette, the liquid in the cartridge is heated so that some of it evaporates. This vapour delivers nicotine into the user's lungs.

There is no smoke, but some nicotine vapour is released into the surrounding air as the user exhales.

Some e-cigarettes have an indicator light at the end which glows when the user is inhaling to give an added touch of realism.

Until now, the company has resisted selling e-cigarettes, but rival  Lloyds Pharmacy stocks BAT’s 
Vype.

The move goes against advice issued by pharmacists’ professional body, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, which advises against pharmacies selling e-cigarettes until they become regulated products.

The Pharmaceutical Journal reports that Puritane will only be available in Boots and will not be advertised.

It is understood that customers wishing to buy the product will have to have a discussion with a pharmacist to ensure they are sold 'appropriately'.

The magazine also reports that the 
pharmacy chain does not want to be seen to be advocating e-cigarettes 
over nicotine replacement therapy such as patches and gum.

On average, some 7 per cent of EU 
citizens have used electronic cigarettes in a quit smoking attempt, 
while in the UK, this figure rises to 9 per cent.

The
 Medicines and Healthcare 
Products Regulatory Agency said last year that e-cigarettes would be 
regulated as medicines from 2016 in order to help people stop smoking.

A spokesperson for the health charity ASH
 - Action on Smoking and Health - told MailOnline: 'The current evidence
 would suggest that e-cigarettes are helping some smokers to move away 
from smoking which is positive. 

'Using an e-cigarette poses much less risk to health than smoking – for the smoker and those around them.

'We want to see safe and effective products on the market which support as many smokers as possible to quit.

'At the moment the quality of these products is highly variable and none are licensed as medicines.

'We support them being made available to those who want to use them, however, until they are licenced as medicines it is important that health professionals continue to direct smokers to products which are licenced and known to be effective. '

An estimated 1.3 million people in the UK are thought to use e-cigarettes.

The majority of them buy products that are manufactured in China where there is very little regulation of their production.

Regardless of the health impacts, many of Britain’s biggest companies have felt required to ban e-cigarettes because they look too similar to the tobacco versions.

McDonald’s, Wetherspoons and The Slug and Lettuce have all banned e-cigarettes as the debate about their safety rages on.
