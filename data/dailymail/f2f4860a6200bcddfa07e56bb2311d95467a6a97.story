If you liked Suri Cruise's Burn Book, you'll love this. A blogger has put together a Pinterest board detailing the adventures of her imaginary daughter Quinoa, an impossibly cool little girl with a wardrobe to die for. 

Called My Imaginary Well-Dressed Toddler Daughter the page brings together dozens of photographs of 'Quinoa' complete with wryly observed spoof commentary.

Quinoa and pals Chevron, Fendi and 
Dolce (actually regular child models posing in high fashion photoshoots) dress to impress but look fashionably bored while making 
scathing comments about their classmates' bad hair or frumpy clothes.

Gems include: 'Quinoa loves her friend Hugo, but wishes that he didn't try quite so 
hard,' and 'Know what really gets Quinoa down in the dumps? Pleather'.

Creative:
Tiffany, an aspiring novelist, says once she started putting the photos
together on Pinterest her sense of humour got the better of her

Inspired: Tiffany Beveridge's Pinterest page My Imaginary Well Dressed 
Toddler Daughter focuses on the adventures of Quinoa, the couture-clad 
little girl she never had

Nonchalant: Quinoa and friends manage to look fashionably bored in every shot

Elsewhere, a photo of Quinoa dressed in hotpants, waistcoat and a slouchy beanie hat looking forlornly into the distance is accompanied by the comment: 'One time, when Quinoa and I got separated in a busy train station, she thankfully remembered our safety training: stay in one place, look spectacular and don't talk to poor people.'

The brains behind the blog, Australian writer and aspiring novelist Tiffany Beveridge, said the idea came about after she became frustrated looking at all the beautiful girls' clothing available to buy - but with two sons, she didn't have a daughter to indulge in.

So she invented one - and made her the most nonchalantly high fashion, cooler-than-thou child she could muster up. The results are hilarious - and have already gained Tiffany thousands of followers on her MIWDTD page.

Tiffany tells Hillary Manton on her blog that MIWDTD started 'very organically' a year and a half ago.

Funny: 'Quinoa loves her friend Hugo, but wishes that he didn't try quite so hard,' and 'Know what really gets Quinoa down in the dumps? Pleather'

'I kept seeing cute things on Pinterest for girls, but felt I had no claim to them since I only have boys,' she said. 'Then I thought, why not? After all, Pinterest is really just an adult Fantasy Land. So I named the board for my imaginary daughter and started re-pinning clothes from friends that I thought were cute and fun.

'And then I guess my sense of humor 
got the better of me. I mean, come on, if I'm going to spend time 
dressing an imaginary daughter on Pinterest, why not go all the way?

She
was surprised by the reaction to the way she had used the site - more 
frequently used as a straightforward place for people to post their 
visual inspiration rather than a humorous site, or photo blog site like 
Tumblr, for instance.

Fantasy
land: Tiffany says the page came about organically, and actually 
started as a moodboard for her to post the little girls' clothes she 
loved but, as she has two sons, could not buy

But Tiffany says she found it a natural place to tell a story - and says the use of humour works well in the medium.

'I think Pinterest has always been about story telling, just maybe not in the way that I’ve done,' she said.

'Take a look at someone’s Pinterest boards and you’ll get a good idea about who they are, about their dreams and wishes - it tells a story about them. I hadn’t realised at the time that what I was doing was such a new concept, but judging from the response, I think it’s shown to be a great medium for creating a story.

As for that name - which you could well imagine cropping up in the next batch of celebrity babies - Tiffany says she came to the name of her daughter after noticing that quinoa was cropping up in endless recipes over Pinterest.

'I remember thinking how funny it was that a grain had become trendy,' Tiffany says. 'Like, so trendy somebody was probably going to name their kid Quinoa. And then I realised that person would be me.'

Parody: The name Quinoa was created after Tiffany noticed the grain had become so fashionable someone was bounded to give it to their child as a name - then realised it was going to be her

Familiar face: Five-year-old Instagram style icon Alonso Mateo makes it onto Quinoa's page as discerning friend Ridley

'Friends, I'd like to introduce you to someone very special--my imaginary well-dressed toddler daughter. Her name is Quinoa, and I found her on Pinterest, begging me to give her an imaginary home filled with designer clothing and incredible lighting. She's a lovely, lovely human being. Would you like to see what she's been up to lately?She rides around town on her mini Vespa scooter, but she always stops for pedestrians.She loves to dress up for church in Chanel and roller skates, because she absolutely adores a juxtaposition.One of her favorite activities is twirling, and nobody does it better than Quinoa.Please don't confuse twirling with spinning; they are very different activities (though she is equally talented at both).Every night, she lays out her impeccable outfit for the next day......then prays for all the children of the world, that they might be as happy, healthy, and well-dressed as she.

Meet Quinoa: Tiffany introduced the concept of her imaginary daughter and friends on her blog, The Would-be Writers Guild

Did I mention that she's thoughtful and well-spoken? She attended the funeral of a classmate's hamster and gave a touching eulogy.Where does she shop, you ask? Where doesn't she shop? is the answer!You want to watch Indiana Jones with her? She's got an outfit for that.Sometimes she lets me dress her up as a Von Trapp child and we sing about raindrops on roses and all of our favorite things.She sure loves our country, right down to the toes of her red designer boots. In fact, she can recite the Pledge of Allegiance in seventeen languages.Even when she's not trying, she manages to look super cool, just like a Hollywood starlet running to Target for some tampons.She's adorable at all times, even when a large spider is crawling toward her on the floor.You should see her dance. She's got the moves like Jagger, and the charm of Gene Kelley, all wrapped up in a size 4T.Before you accuse her of being shallow and obsessed with her looks, you should know that she's a human-rights activist, president of seven book clubs, and is weeks away from a degree in Marine Biology.Oh yes, my little Quinoa is the kind of imaginary daughter every mother dreams of. I consider myself very, very lucky to have her in my life. Wouldn't you?'
