There were charmingly affectionate scenes at the Chelsea Flower Show today, as Prince Harry warmly greeted his family with kisses as they attended the opening of his charity garden.

It was something of a family jolly for the royals at today's VIP opening, and aside from the glorious displays of blooms, it was a chance to offer a show of support to the  unexpected garden designer - Prince Harry.

The 28-year-old helicopter pilot was at Chelsea for the first time with his charity Sentebale, which hopes its African-inspired garden will highlight its work aids orphans in the impoverished kingdom of Lesotho.

It was something of a family jolly for the royals at today's VIP opening of the Chelsea Flower Show, as Prince Harry greeted his father with a kiss

Aside from the glorious displays of blooms, it was a chance to offer a show of support to an unexpected garden designer - Prince Harry, who seemed extremely happy to see his family

The affectionate mood was clearly infectious as the Prince of Wales greets the Duke of Edinburgh with a half hug and kiss during a tour of the B&Q Sentebale Forget-Me-Not Garden

It is the first time that Sentebale has undertaken such a project and the prince has been closely involved in its creation – even examining designs emailed to him by designer Jinny Blom while stationed on the frontline in Afghanistan. 

First up was Uncle Andrew and his daughter, Princess Beatrice, who said afterwards: 'I think it is beautiful and loved the story behind it.'

Next was Uncle Edward - who had to be torn away from the strimmer display, according to Harry - with his father and step-mother hot on his heels.

Charles looked proud as punch at his son's efforts and told him:'This is the great garden is it, after all that effort? I was wondering if it didn't exist.'

Not to be left out the Duchess of Cornwall leans in for a friendly welcome too

And she was even treated to a peck on both of her cheeks by Prince Philip

Princess Beatrice also met with Prince Harry at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show, where he unveiled the Sentebale garden

Harry couldn't resist jesting with his father: 'If there is anything here which might catch your eye we could probably come to a deal. You can't have it, but we can come to a deal.'

'A deal?! ' said Charles with mock outrage.

The Prince of Wales then joked that the large round stone that is one of the main features of the garden could be a dance floor.

It was only then that Harry noticed his grandfather, Prince Philip, waiting to come in. 

'Looking they're even queuing,' he joked.

When Charles failed to notice the other VIP guest, Harry ribbed him: 'Err, pa, meet your father!',  prompting Charles to look up with an exclamation of surprise.

The Prince of Wales was heard joking that the large round stone that is one of the main features of the garden could be a dance floor

The prince even teased Philip that a circular stone centrepiece to his garden span round with flashing lights rather like a nightclub podium

'You were meant to be looking at strimmers and tractors, Grandpa, I didn't know you were coming. Fantastic!' said Harry.

'Hopefully you like it. You've been coming here for years and your opinion is highly regarded.'Are we going to see any of this at Sandringham or Balmoral?'

The prince even teased Philip that a circular stone centrepiece to his garden span round with flashing lights rather like a nightclub podium.

'Really?' Philip enquired earnestly.

'No, Grandpa, they wouldn't let us,' Harry joked.

Last to arrive was the Queen who delighted at her grandson's efforts but apparently told Harry to send a few plants to his father's Stumpery at Highgrove as he 'needed a bit of greenery'.

When the Queen stood with her grandson on the stone circle, which is decorated with hearts and crowns, he told her: “Pa thought it was going to spin round – but sadly it doesn’t.

Miss Blom, who has been working on the design since last August with Harry, said afterwards: 'The Queen liked it. The Prince of Wales would like the plants in the middle to go to the stumpery at Highgrove. The Queen thinks it needs it – it needs some greenery. So we are going to send them down.'

She added: 'She has been coming here (to Chelsea) for nearly 60 years. She said she thought it might be her sixtieth year.

Sentebale was set up by Harry in 2006 following a gap year visit to the tiny - and hugely impoverished - African kingdom of Lesotho.

He was so moved by the experience that he vowed to spend the rest of his life helping the youngest victims of the country’s HIV/AIDS epidemic.

In a country of just 1.8 million people, 23 per cent of adults are HIV positive and their life expectancy has plummeted to just 41 – leaving almost a generation orphaned.

The name Sentebale was chosen as it means ‘forget me not’ in the language of Lesotho, a tribute to both Harry’s mother and that of the children themselves.

The charity hopes that by showing at Chelsea it will raise its profile and fundraising activities.

The garden’s creator, Jinny Blom, said she had been inspired by the landscape of Lesotho itself as well as Harry’s experience of losing his mother Diana, Princess of Wales A pattern of hearts and crowns has been engraved on a circular terrace in the garden, acting as a memorial to the late princess.
