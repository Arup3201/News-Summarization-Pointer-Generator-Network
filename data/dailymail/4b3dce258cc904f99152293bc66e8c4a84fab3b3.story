A teenage girl who plunged from a tower block while trying to avoid arrest during a morning raid had been wanted by police since last summer.

Convicted robber Shanise Paris-Goff, 18, fell from a bedroom window ledge at the 17th storey high-rise flat, while officers stormed the flat.

Scotland Yard had appealed in July, last year, for help to find her after she failed to register with her probation officer following her early release from a young offenders' institution in April, last year.

Shanise Paris-Goff plunged to her death from the 17th floor of a block of flats in Woolwich on Monday

She had served nearly two years of a three-year sentence for a series of muggings, attempted robbery and assault.

They finally tracked her down to her boyfriend's high-rise flat and is thought to have panicked on seeing the officers.

The teenager, who dubbed herself 
'Reckless Shen', scrambled on to a bedroom window ledge at the flat in 
Woolwich, South East London where she plunged to her death.

On her Facebook page while on the 
loose, the tearaway taunted them, saying 'Catch me if you can' and '****
 the feds and **** the law'.

Miss Paris-Goff, who was also known as Sherise Steabler, was said to have been released from prison in April last year under licence

Death: The 17th-storey window from which Shanise plunged to her death

She was sentenced at Croydon Crown Court in May 2009 and released on April 20 last year on licence and subject to a curfew.

The teenager, from St Paul's Cray, 
near Orpington, Kent, who also went by the name Shenice and Sherise 
Steabler, appears to have spent her days posting updates on Facebook 
about smoking cannabis and moaning about her curfew.

Eight days after her release, she wrote: 'Probation is a lonnnnnnng tome [time]! I'm a criminal get me outta here!'

Then on May 26, she said: '**** dis 
curfew **** its depresin ma life.'

But after breaching the terms of her 
release by not registering with the Probation Service or turning up to 
any meetings, her licence was revoked three months later.

After going into hiding, she taunted police on June 17 last year, saying: 'Katch me if yuh kann!'
  Friends urged her to change her ways 
at the beginning of this year, with one asking: 'Where is your life 
going? Seriously. Think about it.'

But Shanise retorted: 'I hear yuh buh I'm only gonna live once so ima do it my way!!'

In an bizarre rant posted on New 
Year's Eve, she had written: '**** the new year! Were all gonna die! 
Hope yuh lot r ready kah I am!'

Meticulous: Forensic officers scour the grounds for evidence after Shanise's death

Shanise Paris-Goff plunged to her death from the 17th floor of a block of flats in Woolwich yesterday

On her homepage, she described 
herself as a beautiful, outgoing girl with a loud mouth, writing: 'I'm 
Only Gonna Live Once So I Do **** My Way!!

'I've Made A lot Of Mistakes In The 
Short Period Of Time I've Lived Buh I Say **** It S*** Happens Life Goes
 Orn!' She added: 'I'm One Ina Million!!'

Last night her parents were said to be too upset to speak about her death but friends and family paid tribute on Facebook.

Her cousin, Krystle Goff wrote: 'Ur at peace now. Make sure yuh party hard up ther. I love you xxx.'
  An inquiry into her death will be held
 by the Independent Police Complaints Commission and the Met Force's 
Directorate of Professional Standards.

Neighbours told how they heard a woman scream 'Get off me'.

The two plain-clothes officers who went to the one-bedroomed flat will be questioned about her final movements.

Shortly after they arrived, police said Shanise retreated to the bedroom alone, half closing the door behind her.

Seconds later she fell. Her death was witnessed by children on the estate who screamed in horror.
  Officers later arrested her boyfriend Mason Okotie, 18, on suspicion of assisting an offender.
