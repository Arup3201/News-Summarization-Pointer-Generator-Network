Noah Ritter became an internet sensation after an interview in which he just can't stop saying the word 'apparently' garnered more than 4.6million views on YouTube.

But - apparently - the adorable five-year-old is not actually sure what his favorite word even means.

In an interview with the Today show this morning, the Pottstown, Pennsylvania youngster earnestly admitted: 'No, I don't know how to spell "apparently". I don't know what it means, but I use it in, "Wow, this is apparently annoying."'

Big word for a small boy: Overnight internet star Noah Ritter, five, has admitted that he's not actually sure what his favorite word, 'apparently', actually means

Enjoying his fifteen minutes of fame: When asked what it's been like to be an overnight star, he gushed rather eloquently: 'It's like being a thousand drops of heaven'

What's more, he then informed the crew that he's just about ready to retire the word altogether. 'I'm tired of it,' he said while perched on a swing in his back yard.

Still, there's no doubt that the confident redhead has thoroughly enjoyed his 15 minutes of fame.

When asked what it's been like to be an overnight star, he gushed rather eloquently: 'It's like being a thousand drops of heaven.'

In Noah's original live television interview, which appeared on WNEP TV on Friday, a newscaster is seen approaching him on the opening day of the Wayne County Fair in nearby Honesdale. 

While reporter Sofia Ojeda was seeking a verdict on the ride he had just been on with his grandfather, Noah had his own agenda.

Exhibiting a fondness for the word 'apparently', he said: 'It was great and apparently I’ve never 
been on live television but apparently sometimes I don’t watch the news 
because I’m a kid and apparently every time Grandpa just gives me the 
remote I have to watch the Powerball.'

The preschooler was clearly excited to share his views, confidently holding the microphone and speaking in a somewhat newscaster-y voice.

Still attempting to get her soundbite, Ms Ojeda asked again how Noah had enjoyed his ride, only to get more of his adorable perspective on life.

'Well, it was great because apparently 
you’re spinning around and apparently every time you get dizzy, that’s 
all you do is get dizzy,' he said. 'I’ve never ever been 
on live television. I've never been on live television.'

The amused reporter, who is seen crouching down to speak at his level, asks: 'Are you excited?'

To which Noah replies: 'Yeah, and apparently I only went down the super slide. . . I was scared half to death. I just freak out.'

Noah used the word 'apparently' no less than eight times during the one-and-a-half-minute interview, and repeated that he had never been on live television three times.

Noah's grandfather, Jack Borowski, who had accompanied him to the fair, told ABC News: 'Noah is pretty talkative. He has a large vocabulary.'

Apparently, he's now famous: Noah's performance has been watched over 4million times on YouTube

He added that the youngster appears to be enjoying his newfound fame.

'We were watching it on the computer and
 it replayed on the local news,' Mr Borowski said. 'He’s going, "That’s 
me. I’m a celebrity."'

But for Noah, who is spending the summer with his grandfather, TV fame comes a lowly third place in his list of favorite things. Mr Borowski says his first loves are dinosaurs and swimming.

'We go down to the history museum in Philadelphia about once a month because he loves the dinosaurs,' he said. 'And we go for swim lessons every Saturday morning because he loves to swim.'
