Summer barbecues are no longer confined to dry land, thanks to the BBQ Donut boat.

Designed by inventor Sebastian Schmitt, the bright orange vessel is the perfect venue for up to ten friends wanting a barbecue with a difference.

But at £13,000, it costs a fair bit more than a throwaway BBQ from Tesco.

Good times: Groups of friends share food while floating on BBQ Donuts

Measuring 
three-and-a-half-metres in diameter, there are two size models of the 
boat - both customisable with the option of LED lighting.

Containing
 a five HP engine with a 12-litre tank, the basic BBQ-donut provides 
between six to eight hours of driving time and costs 15,990 euros.

A low-smoke charcoal kettle grill has been installed in the centre - set up to ensure maximum safety and ease of use.

Holiday offer: A branded BBQ Donut which allows guests to arrange a meal on the water

The grill can later be removed to provide the perfect ice bucket - rooted in the middle of a moulded table so food remains safely on plates.

And boarding the floating food grill is easy thanks to its moveable side section.

The
 adjustable sun shade means the feast - and ride - can be enjoyed for 
hours with ample storage space for necessities underneath the seats.

Sebastian, 37, came up with the idea while studying architecture.

He said: 'I was sitting and chilling with my friends on a lake near Mainz, Germany.

'I thought, instead of grilling on land it must be possible to grill on water. But in a good looking and chilled design.'

He sketched and designed the bbq-donut himself - which has since been sold in 40 countries.
