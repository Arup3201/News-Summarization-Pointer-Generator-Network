Council members were sent ducking for cover after a gunman opened fire outside a city building in Minnesota yesterday evening.

The suspect started shooting outside New Hope City Hall at about 7.15pm, moments after a swearing-in ceremony for two new officers had concluded.

The newly sworn-in officers and others were leaving the city council chambers when they encountered a man who opened fire with a 'long gun'. 

After shots rang out at New Hope City Hall in Minnesota yesterday evening, members of the council were sent ducking for cover. Two police officers were struck and other officers  returned fire, killing the gunman

Two New Hope police officers were struck and other officers immediately returned fire, killing the gunman. No one else was injured.  

Chief Deputy Mike Carlson with the Hennepin County Sheriff's Department did not identify the gunman or reveal a possible motive for the attack. 

Cable-access video of the scene inside the council chambers was posted to YouTube.

In the video, council members take cover behind their desks as shots ring out. 

One man pulls out a handgun and tells his fellow council members to 'get down'.

'Get down! Everybody get down!' he says. 'If this is being taped, go to commercial, go away from this.'

'Somebody got shot,' another council member adds. 

Ducking for cover seemed like a good idea after the unnamed gunman began shooting on Monday night 

The wounded officers are in good condition and are expected to survive. 

They have not been named and it is not clear if they were the newly sworn-in officers or veterans of the force. 

Authorities are continuing to investigate the incident, but they are not looking for any additional suspects.

New Hope City Hall is across the street from a retirement community.

'To have it happen right across the street from our home, with police officers in parking lots with drawn guns, it's scary, very scary,' resident Linda Townsend told CBS Minnesota.
