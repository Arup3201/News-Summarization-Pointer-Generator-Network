Diners at a Manhattan sushi destination known for its famous clientel discovered a roach infestation in the worst possible way: it fell right on top of them.

Blue Ribbon Sushi in Soho was hit with an indoor rain storm of roaches Wednesday as several of the creepy-crawlies fell from the ceiling and onto a table and even patrons' legs.

Luckily there have been no reports that high-profile fans of the posh Japanese joint like Gwyneth Paltrow, Faith Hill and Taylor Swift were around to see it.

Famous fans: Taylor Swift and model Cara Delevigne are two of the celebrities pictured most recently leaving the Soho hot spot Blue Ribbon Sushi, where roaches reportedly rained down on customers Monday

Consciously unsettling: Gwyneth Paltrow and Faith Hill have also been spotted lunching at the Soho sushi hot spot where several roaches tumbled down on customers from above

According to the New York Observer, a male diner was lunching at Blue Ribbon when a critter tumbled down onto his table.

Four more roaches followed suit, with one evening landing on his leg.

'These weren’t small cockroaches,' he told the Observer. 'A person from the restaurant said, "Maybe it’s about to rain, this hasn’t happened before.”'

While none of the bugs fell directly onto food, another diner reportedly had one crawl right onto his leg.

A customer said that five roaches rained down from the ceiling on Monday at the hip eatery

The Observer source said proprietors only comped half the patrons' food bills.

Eric Bromberg, who co-owns the restaunt and several others carrying the Blue Ribbon name, says the issue has been resolved.

'Once we knew we had an issue, we scheduled our exterminator to come that day, as soon as possible, and we waged war.

'After many hours we found the source — located next door — and rectified the issue. The entire restaurant has been thoroughly searched and cleaned and we are moving ahead with service as usual.'

Not a refund? No roaches landed on any of the unique sushi or sashimi creations and proprietors, who say the problem has been fixed, gave diners half off
