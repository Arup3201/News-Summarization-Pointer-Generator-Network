Fracking could decide the next election, it was claimed today with more than three-quarters of the Tories' top target seats been opened up for oil and gas exploration.

Energy minister Matthew Hancock struggled on live radio this morning to name a single village which would welcome fracking on their doorstep,

As Greenpeace claimed dozens of marginal seats were at risk, Tory MPs called for more financial compensation for areas which could be chosen as drilling sites.

The Government today launched the latest bidding round for onshore oil and gas licences, which covers around half the country.

Shale gas development will be all but banned in National Parks and other protected countryside – and permitted only in ‘exceptional circumstances’.

The move from the Department for Energy and Climate Change is likely to be seen as an attempt to head off a potential revolt in Middle England over fracking in the run up to next year’s election.

But Greenpeace warned that the licensing area also covered freshwater aquifers and intruded on 10 national parks.

The Government has committed to going 'all out for shale', claiming development of the gas and oil resource is needed to improve energy security, boost jobs and the economy and bring down energy prices.

But opponents say it causes disruption and damaging development in the countryside, can cause minor earthquakes and the risk of water pollution, and that exploiting new oil and gas resources is not compatible with tackling climate change.

Mr Hancock, appointed energy minister in this month’s reshuffle, was challenged on BBC Radio 4 to name anywhere which is 'welcoming the frackers in' he just changed the subject.

He added: ‘There is the potential under the land. Now, it is only potential; we’ve got to get out and explore where it is, but I’m also determined that we should do this in a way that is sensitive.

‘For instance, we’ve increased the planning guidelines, the protections on national parks and on areas of outstanding national beauty in order to do this in a sensitive way because we’ve got to make the most of the energy resources that we’ve got as a country, but we’ve also got to protect our beautiful countryside.’

Three areas of Britain, in the north and south of England and in Scotland, have been identified by the British Geological Survey (BGS) as prospective areas for shale gas and oil.

But the latest licensing round opens up a far larger area for potential fracking or other oil and gas exploration - though it is likely that energy companies will focus on areas where resources are easiest to access.

Analysis by Greenpeace suggests that 24 of the 31 constituencies represented by MPs who are in the Cabinet are affected by the new licence area, while 31 out of 40 target seats in the Conservative's 2015 election strategy are also affected.

The licencing area reaches into 92 per cent of Labour-held seats, covering 506 constituencies in total, affects 10 out of 13 national parks, 47 per cent of major aquifers and all 10 of the UK's largest cities, Greenpeace said.

Greenpeace UK energy campaigner Simon Clydesdale said that putting out the new licensing round after MPs had gone on their summer holidays showed how 'politically toxic' an issue fracking had become.

'Just a few months ago ministers were falling over each other to make big announcements about shale gas.

'Now, with MPs in Tory heartlands feeling the heat and all but seven Cabinet ministers threatened by drilling in their constituencies, there could be a high political price to pay for this shale steamroller at next year's general election.'

Tory MP Eric Ollerenshaw warned fracking would be a ‘serious’ issue in his Lancaster and Fleetwood constituency at the next election.

He told BBC Radio’s World at One: ‘We still believe there should be a greater payback to local areas.

'In Lancashire, we've been used to coalmining, we've got nuclear, we're covered by wind turbines on sea and hills.

‘So this kind of industry is not particularly new and one can see the possibility of jobs. But there still is some concerns about the environmental damage and some concerns about what is the payback.’

Cllr Mike Jones, from the Local Government Association, said: ‘Communities, through their democratically-elected councils and the planning system, will decide whether fracking is right for them.

‘Given the significant tax breaks being proposed for the firms involved and likely returns, an offer from the industry to local communities of one per cent of revenues and compensation schemes is not enough, and we are seeking a better deal for residents if extraction of oil and gas takes place.’

The analysis by Greenpeace comes after a ComRes poll of more than 1,000 people in the 40 most marginal constituencies found low support for fracking from voters across the political spectrum.

The poll for industry body RenewableUK found that just 15 per cent of those intending to vote Tory thought developing shale oil and gas was a top priority for ensuring energy security, compared to 43 per cent who thought the greatest focus should be on more renewables.

Of those planning to vote Ukip, just 11 per cent put fracking for shale as a top priority, while 52 per cent listed developing new renewables as the highest priority. Would-be Labour and Lib Dem voters were also much more in favour of renewables than fracking.
