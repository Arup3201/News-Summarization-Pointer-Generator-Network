After fighting to stay cool, Steve McClaren now has a battle of greater significance. His Derby County team must arrest their alarming slump if this season is not to finish in even deeper disappointment than the last.

Wolves inflicted another defeat with a determined display and have the play-offs firmly in sight. Derby were top after 33 games, 11 points ahead of Kenny Jackett’s side. After a sixth match without a win the gap is just two. Derby do not look safe in fifth. Wolves are in the prowl in seventh.

McClaren was furious with referee Keith Stroud’s call that denied his team an opening goal. He will be angry with his defenders for the Wolves goals.

In the 69th minute goalkeeper Lee Grant elected to punch rather than catch the ball after Craig Forsyth had slashed a clearance skywards. Grant succeeded only in diverting it horribly into his own net.

Forsyth was at fault earlier. Three minutes after the interval he erred in sending a clearance to Kevin McDonald, who fed the Nouha Dicko. The Mali striker dispatched his finish through the legs of two Derby defenders.

The match was utterly absorbing. Derby hit the woodwork twice, Wolves once. There were shots, saves, and in the 39th minute a real shocker. Amid the end-to-end chances, Stroud intervened in entirely unnecessary fashion.

Jesse Lingard slipped a pass to Darren Bent, who was tugged down by Wolves captain Danny Batth as he ran clear. In an instant Tom Ince arrived to pop the ball into the unguarded net.

But Stroud had blown to award the visitors a free-kick. He compounded the error by failing to administer a card of any colour despite the foul warranting red for denying a goalscoring opportunity.

McClaren, sitting in the stands, ripped the headset from his ear and made his way to the touchline to remonstrate. Growing animated, he was mocked by Wolves fans. ‘Where’s your brolly gone?’ they sang.

Craig Bryson fired the free-kick at goal and Tomasz Kuszczak, not for the first or last time, dived to save. The Polish goalkeeper had earlier made fine stops from a Lingard piledriver and a long-ranger by Ince.

Ince was targeted by Wolves fans for his England Under-21 withdrawal. ‘Eng-ur-land,’ they chanted. He nearly silenced them in the 25th minute with a curling shot that hit the bar.

Wolves were more than competing. In the 27th minute a cross by Dicko was deflected to Benik Afobe whose volley was kept out by Lee Grant. Dicko sent another effort just wide.

He made no mistake with his goal to send Molineux wild.

Derby pressed hard in the second period and Kuszczak produced his finest save by getting his fingertips to Bryson’s sweet drive, diverting the ball onto the post. 

Wolves hit the woodwork too, when McDonald sent Afobe clear with a long pass. The Wolves striker smacked the crossbar. Grant then gifted the hosts the clincher and Derby’s race was run.

Afterwards, McClaren had one thing on his mind. ‘It’s cost us the game,’ he said of Stroud’s decision. ‘He will watch it again and know he is wrong.’

McClaren implements a no-swear policy but admitted he breached it when trying to make sense of the officiating. He spoke to the referees assessor to air his grievance.

‘We try not to complain too much about referees like we see in the game,’ he said. ‘But it is very difficult to keep our humility.’

McClaren believes his side can ‘absolutely’ win all their remaining seven games to reassert a push for automatic promotion. A play-off place is the minimum requirement. He hopes his injured players including Chris Martin, Jeff Hendrick, and George Thorne will all be back after the international break.

Jackett wants two points per match in the run-in to reach the play-offs just a season after winning League One. ‘We’re in with a really good shout of being able to take one of those three promotion places,’ he said. ‘We have potency up front and pace that disturbs defenders.

‘When Derby beat us by five (in November), at that junction it looked like a chasm between the two clubs. Derby have been setting the benchmark for quality in the Championship. So for us to be two points behind we’re delighted.’
