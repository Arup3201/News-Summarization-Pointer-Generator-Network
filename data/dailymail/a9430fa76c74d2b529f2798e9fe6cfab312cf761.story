Dennis Eugene Emery, 57, cocked the gun, pointed it at the animal and then for some reason turned it around right as it fired, shooting himself in the face

A man accidentally shot himself dead while threatening to kill one of the family dogs during a heated argument with his wife at their home in Florida.

Police say Dennis Eugene Emery, 57, cocked the gun, pointed it at the animal and then for some reason turned it around right as it fired, shooting himself in the face.

He had been fighting with his wife Francisca and warned her that he would shoot one of their dogs in their Pinellas Park home, before producing the revolver.

'He was involved in a domestic disturbance with his wife,' Sergeant Adam Geissenberger of the Pinellas Park Police Department told Fox 13.

'During that disturbance he retrieves a firearm, he produces the firearm, and he threatens to shoot one of the family's animals.'

'It's a shame. It's a damn shame. I never figured him to be irresponsible with a handgun,' next door neighbor Dallas Collins said.

Mr Collins told the news channel that Emery's wife owned 13 border collies, and the dogs' barking was a constant source of tension between the couple.

According to the Tampa Bay Times, police said the argument started because Emery was upset as he could not find his lighter.

He picked up a revolver and pulled back the hammer to emphasize his threat to shoot the animal. As he released the hammer while also turning the gun to his face, the revolver fired.

Police said Emery had experienced 34 run-ins with the law since 2012. He was arrested three times in five days in October. 

Charges against him for aggravated assault, resisting arrest, and leaving the scene of a crash were pending at the time of his death.

Investigators originally received conflicting reports over whether the shooting was unintentional or  suicide, but they now say they believe it to be an accident.

Sgt Geissenberger added: 'Loss of life, regardless of the situation, is very tragic and now this family has to deal with the loss of a loved one very close to the holidays.'
