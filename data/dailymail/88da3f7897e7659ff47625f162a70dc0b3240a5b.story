Democrats in Washington are either indestructible or in denial, with high-profile left-wingers insisting they won't lose control of the U.S. Senate to Republicans on Tuesday.

Vice President Joe Biden said Monday that he is sure it isn't going to happen.

'I predict we're gonna – we're gonna keep the Senate,'  he told a CNN interviewer. 'I've been in 66, 67 races all told, and I don't get the feeling that the oddsmakers are getting.'

Prognosticators everywhere from right-wing websites to the left-leaning Washington Post – which puts the odds of a Republican takeover at a whopping 96 per cent – say he's not merely suffering a Cassandra complex, doomed to be ever-correct but never believed.

His boss, Barack Obama, is on his side.

GROUND GAME: DNC chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (in purple) insists that her party won't give up the Senate gavel to the GOP – 'We're going to hold the Senate,' she says  

Asked if the president shares Biden's optimism, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Monday that 'he does.'  

Obama, he said, believes voters will remain focused on the need to 'be supportive of a candidate who is fighting for policies that benefit middle-class families.'

Earnest went further, predicting that Democrats would do the better job getting voters to the polls, 'backed by a tried-and-true ground campaign strategy that, in the context of a very close race, could provide the two- or three-vote margin that could eventually make up the difference.'

Last week he insisted that the White House remained 'confident,' saying that the president's progressive policy vision is 'in the best interest of the country.'

'Many Democratic candidates have been able to apply the lessons learned from the success of the Obama campaign in 2012 to benefit their own campaigns,' he cautioned, refusing to give ground on the question of Tuesday's results. 

He also referred reporters to the Democratic National Committee for a 'more granular' analysis. 

Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the DNC's chairwoman, has fired rhetorical salvos in recent days that make the Obama administration's predictions sound weak and tentative.

'We're going to hold the Senate,' she said Sunday on the ABC News program 'This Week.'

Slamming her GOP counterpart Reince Priebus for his get-out-the-vote effort, she said Democrats 'have a ground game that I know [he] would take over theirs any day of the week."

Priebus disagreed.

'Our ground game is whipping their ground game,' he retorted. 'We're going to have a great night.' 

Claiming that polling margins were too narrow to call many crucial states one way or another, Wasserman Schultz stood firm.

'When we keep races this close,' she said, 'Democrats win.'

WOUNDED: Obama's 41 per cent approval rating is lower than the 44 per cent he had four years ago – when Democrats lost big in the last midterm election

TROUBLE AT 1600: Josh Earnest, the White House's chief spokesman, acknowledged the Democrats' uphill climb but claimed they would beat back Republicans in enough statewide races to hold on to power

On the even of the 2010 midterm election that Obama later acknowledged was a 'shellacking' for his party, his job approval rating stood at 44 per cent. Monday morning's final poll from Gallup put that number at a more dismal 41 per cent.

The GOP needs to pick up just six Senate seats on Tuesday to control both the House and Senate for the first time in a decade.

It's possible but unlikely that potential run-off elections in Georgia and Louisiana could muddy the waters until as late as January 6. 

Earnest tacitly acknowledged at the White House that Obama might have to tweak his approach to governing if Republicans manage their hoped-for Senate takeover.

'Every time you have a midterm or presidential election, the consequences are significant,' he conceded. 

But 'I do think,' he said, 'the Democrats will retain the majority.'

Regardless of a shift in its tactical toolbox, he assured reporters that the administration would keep the same policy focus 'regardless of who is in the majority in the Senate.'

'I continue to think it's gonna be Democrats, but we'll see,' Earnest said.
