A former police chief allegedly tried to commit suicide after being charged with the sexual abuse of a four-year-old female relative.

Andrew Demers Jr, a 73-year-old married grandfather, reportedly tried to kill himself days before an investigation was launched into whether he engaged in unlawful sexual conduct with a child.

The former chief of the Maine State Police confessed from his intensive care bed last week at the Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston, according to the sheriff's office.

Andrew Demers Jr, 73, the former chief of Maine State Police, was charged with unlawful sexual contact with a four-year-old female relative on Monday

Demers, who was named a Legendary Trooper ten years ago, turned himself in on Monday at the county jail. He was released on $5,000 cash bail.

He was charged with a single count of unlawful sexual contact and faces up to ten years in prison.

Demers, who served as an officer for 26 years, was chief of state police for six years from 1987 until 1993 when he retired. 

The investigation began after police were tipped off on March 10 about the allegations involving a female relative.

The alleged abuse had been taking place at Demers' house in New Gloucester for several months, according to the Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce. No other victims have been named.

The sheriff said it is unclear if the suicide attempt and the fact Demers was about to be investigated by police were related. 

Demers’ attorney, Walter McKee, told the Press Herald that it was wrong of detectives to interview his client in the ICU. He added: 'Is the ICU really the place you want to conduct a reliable interview involving serious allegations?'

Due to new legislation, the former police chief will not lose his police pension if convicted.

Demers came under fire in the 1970s when it was alleged that he turned a blind eye to allegations of abuse against several boys by the founder of the Cole Farms Restaurant in Gray, who was a close personal friend.

Restaurateur Warren Cole was charged with sexually molesting a boy from 1986-7. He was jailed in 1992.
