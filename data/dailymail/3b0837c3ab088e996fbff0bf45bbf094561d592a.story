The terms and conditions on tickets for the PDC World Darts Championships at Alexandra Palace said the wearing of football shirts was forbidden in order not to stir up club rivalry.

However, the nearest to a crowd disturbance after the final last Sunday involved two Crystal Palace players Jason Puncheon and Barry Bannan, who went to the event following the club’s FA Cup third-round win at Dover Athletic.

Witnesses report that a highly-agitated Puncheon had to be restrained by Bannan after being taunted by football fans as he left the venue following Gary Anderson’s victory.

Puncheon, whose high and wide penalty miss against Tottenham a year ago has been described as the worst ever, was said to have been eager to confront his hecklers head-on but he was sensibly bundled into a car by Bannan and other friends.

A PDC darts spokesman said: ‘The two Palace players had paid for VIP seats and they left the venue without incident.’

A spokesman for Crystal Palace did not dispute what happened but did not comment.

The unusual kick-off time of 7.55pm for BBC’s coverage of the AFC Wimbledon vs Liverpool FA Cup tie on Monday has prompted conspiracy theories about the Beeb wanting to start the second half before the return of acclaimed series Broadchurch on ITV. 

Host Gary Lineker urged viewers at the interval to stay with the Cup drama. However, the Beeb insist the start time was planned to give them the required build-up period and that live games in previous rounds had the same schedule.

Geoff Boycott, blocked from a knighthood by the Cabinet Office because of his disputed conviction in France 16 years ago for an alleged attack on former girlfriend Margaret Moore, would not have had his worthy cause helped by his choice of PR advisor in his legal fight against the French justice system. It was disgraced celebrity publicist Max Clifford, jailed for eight years last May for a string of indecent assaults.

Uefa chief Michel Platini was seen deep in conversation with Prince Ali in the gardens of the Mamounia Hotel during last month’s FIFA summit in Marrakech, but there is no UEFA deal in place to support the Jordanian’s candidature against Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency. 

Prince Ali, who will struggle for votes even from within his own Asian confederation, will discover that UEFA is split over Blatter, who enjoys considerable support in Eastern Europe. Not having all UEFA behind him was the reason Holland’s Michael van Praag did not stand.

MCC goes star crazy

The endless internal warfare within MCC now sees Lord’s members irate that the management committee have given a preferential star to four candidates — including Mike Gatting — that they would most like to see elected from the seven standing for election.

Those snubbed include Mark Williams, nominated by Mike Atherton and Sir John Major. Williams is standing for re-election and supports the aborted Lord’s Vision redevelopment.

Vocal member Paddy Briggs, in a letter to chairman Oliver Stocken, describes the star system as ‘authoritarian and secretive cronyism’, adding: ‘Any candidate who disagrees with the party line receives no starring. It is undemocratic, elitist and self-aggrandising.’

Mike Gatting, pictured at Wimbledon, is among a list of four preferential candidates 

The England footballers’ code of conduct, introduced in 2012 following a series of indiscretions, has been mothballed. But it will surely have to be dusted down for a decision on Saido Berahino’s immediate international future if he is found guilty of drink driving. 

The West Brom striker was stopped by police on the M6 in October but the FA knew nothing about the arrest when he was called up in November. Berahino was charged and will appear at North Cheshire magistrates on January 19.

The Leeds pantomime season continues with owner Massimo Cellino, faced with being banned until March for failing the owners’ and directors’ test, telling his driver Pete Lockwood, the players’ liaison officer, that he intends to install him as president in any absence. 

Lockwood said: ‘We had a laugh about it. I think it was just a flippant remark, but you never know with the chairman.’
