She's famous for her broad smile and sparkling white teeth but an animated Duchess of Cambridge proved that she's not one to stand around and grin when there's talking to be done.

During this morning's tour of Kensington, the Duchess showed off a full range of expressions, from big smiles to bashful glances.

Some of the more pained looks could have been the result of a particularly large kick from the fourth in line to the throne, who, said Kate, is now moving around constantly.

'It's moving all the time,' said the Duchess, who was chatting to 17-year-old Martina McDonagh at the time. 'I can feel it kicking now.'

The Duchess, who is six months pregnant, is due to give birth to her second child at the end of April but admitted that she and Prince William still don't know the sex of their unborn child.

Today's animated pictures of the Duchess are in stark contrast to those taken last Monday, which showed a tired-looking Kate shopping in London.

In those, the 33-year-old looked worn out by the rigours of pregnancy although that was partly the result, said insiders, of her reining in her beauty regime in order to keep her baby healthy.

By Thursday, when Kate was introduced to flamboyant Turner-prize winning artist Grayson Perry during a visit to a Ladbroke Grove primary school, that had all changed with the Duchess back on polished form.

She proved an eager visitor once again on Friday when she followed up her visit to an art studio run by The Art Room charity with a trip to meet foster carers in Islington.

There, an animated Kate chatted happily with foster parents and children, before declaring herself smitten with one adorable six-month-old baby girl.

Today saw a return to royal form with the Duchess, clearly enjoying the burst of health bestowed on pregnant women, joking with schoolchildren and chatting to parents and teachers.

By the time she was introduced to two-year-old Ryan Dixon, who promptly burst into tears at the sight of her during a visit to Family Friends, she was in such a good mood, she cheerfully laughed off the moment and smilingly accepted a posy from his mother instead.
