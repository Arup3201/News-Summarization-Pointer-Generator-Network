A police station in South Australia has been given the all clear after testing revealed no toxic substances were contained in a letter opened by an officer.

Two police officers reportedly felt unwell and Victor Harbor police station was locked down after a feared biohazard attack in Adelaide. The station has now reopened.

But Chief Inspector Ashley Gordon later said only one officer was involved and it might have been a coincidence that she felt nauseated.

Victor Harbor police station in Adelaide has been locked down following a suspected biohazard attack

The letter had been tested and did not contain anything toxic or any threats, he said.

In the past day or so, a couple of letters had been sent, apparently by the same person, to police around the state, but they also did not contain threats or anything toxic.

'We have advised our officers to keep a lookout for these letters,' Insp Gordon told AAP.

A suspicious letter was sent to the Victor Harbor police station on Wednesday morning and the officer-in-charge, a 42-year-old female, began to feel unwell after opening the letter.

Ambulance and fire service crews were called to the police station just before noon.

A witness told advertiser.com.au that the letter was from China and was believed to have contained biohazardous chemicals.

A spokesperson for SA Ambulance told MailOnline that the two officers complained of ‘feeling generally unwell’ but were both conscious. One had complained of feeling dizzy.

The 42-year-old woman was treated for dizziness and one officer was transferred to Victor Harbor Hospital.

The spokesperson said the officer was hospitalised as a 'precautionary measure' and the illnesses were 'nothing serious'.

The police station has been locked down and MFS firefighters entered the building wearing hazmat equipment.

They removed the letter, which was wrapped in yellow plastic, before decontaminating the police station.

A spokesperson for South Australian police confirmed that the station had been evacuated due to the letter, but they could not confirm where the letter came from or what it contained.
