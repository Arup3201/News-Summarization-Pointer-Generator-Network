A senior RAF officer who served as a personal aide to the Queen was knocked down and killed by a van driver as he cycled home, a court has heard.

Group Captain Tom Barrett from Beaconsfield, Bucks, was hit by transit driver Paul Luker as he rode home along the A40 in March last year.

Gp Capt Barrett was rushed to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, but later died from multiple injuries.

Trial: Paul Luker, left, is accused of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving after Group Captain Tom Barrett was knocked down as he rode his bike on the A40

The 44-year-old was Station Commander of RAF Northolt and had served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He had also been awarded an OBE.

Harrow Crown Court heard that Gp Capt Barrett, a married father-of-two, was an avid cyclist and often used his journey home from the base as a training exercise for races.

The jury was told that on March 10 last year he left shortly before 5pm and joined the inside lane of the A40.

He had travelled less than a mile when he was hit by a transit van being driven by Luker, 51, of Farnham Royal, Bucks.

Motorists who witnessed the crash described hearing a 'loud bang' and seeing a 'twisted wheel' flying through the air after the crash.

Adina Ezekiel, prosecuting said: 'He was thrown off his bicycle and he landed on the roadside.

'His life was pronounced extinct later that day.'

Miss Ezekiel added: 'He sometimes used his journey home as an opportunity for training and this was one such occasion.

'When he left work, he was wearing cycling gear, including a helmet, heart rate monitor and dark clothing.

'He joined the A40 at the Polish War Memorial and it is agreed evidence that Gp Capt Barrett cycled before the collision was about 0.8miles. 

'The result of the impact is that Gp Capt Barrett was thrown forward, his feet were clipped into his bicycle so they remained attached.'

The court heard that Luker told police at the roadside that he was 'dazzled' by the sun.

Gp Capt Barrett died of multiple injuries at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, following the collision with the van

He said: 'I was on the inside lane, 
the slow lane, and the sun was low at the time, my sight was pretty bad 
but before I knew it, I had hit the cyclist.  'I tried to move out of 
his way but it was too late.

'My wing clipped him, I tried to brake but by that time it was too late and I just saw him flying off his bike.' 

But Miss Ezekiel said that Mr Luker told police he didn't see the 
cyclist at all. He had been dazzled by sunlight and was not aware that 
he hit Gp Capt Barrett.

'The prosecution are not suggesting 
that Mr Luker set out deliberately or maliciously to collide with Gp 
Capt Barrett's bicycle.

'But the question is whether the driving was careless or inconsiderate.

'The prosecution say he should have adapted his driving style if the conditions were not better for him to see.'

Motorist Rakhi Mangtani, who was driving behind Luker, told how she head a 'loud bang' and saw a wheel flying through the air over the top of her car, after the crash. 

'The wheel was twisted and other bits of black debris were flying in the air, which I swerved to avoid,' she said. 

'The driver didn't seem to stop immediately after the wheel flew over my car, it certainly wasn't an emergency stop.

Ms Mantangi added she then ran towards the scene of the crash.

'I could see the cyclist lying on the pavement. He was lying far over to the left on the grass verge.'

Luker, who was not arrested until April 1, denies causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
