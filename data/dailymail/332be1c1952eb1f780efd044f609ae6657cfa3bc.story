If you've used Gmail recently you might want to check you didn't send confidential or potentially embarrassing messages to the wrong people.

A bug in the email provider's autocomplete tool has resulted in random addresses being added to emails.

And if the sender didn't spot the mistake before hitting send, private information could have been shared with the wrong person.

When a user type an address in Gmail Google suggests addresses from their Contacts list (pictured). Gmail is supposed to prioritise addresses the user sends mail to most often, but the bug means random and less frequent addresses are being placed at the top of the list. Emails are then  sent without being checked

Twitter users began complaining about the bug at the weekend and more reports emerged yesterday.

One wrote: 'For a company as awesome as Google, Gmail is making me [miss] the old days of Outlook...Takes forever to load, freezes, autocomplete bugs etc.'

While another added: 'Good to know I'm not the only one.'

When a user type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of a message on Gmail, Google will suggest addresses from their Contacts list. 

Users can choose the name at the top of the list by hitting Enter, or can scroll down to select an alternative. 

If Gmail doesn't suggest the address the user wants they can continue typing.

A Google spokesperson said: We're aware of an issue with Gmail and auto-complete and are currently investigating. 

Apologies for any inconvenience.'

But a number of Twitter users are criticising affected users for not checking, moving the fault away from Google.
