A man enlisted the help of family, friends and about 40 professional dancers to ask his girlfriend to marry him, putting all other proposals to shame.

Bret surprised the 'girl of his dreams,' Jovan, by flying in her mother, stepfather, brother, sisters and best friend from home.

Jovan was having lunch at a cafe in Los Angeles with her friend Connie, when the elaborate spectacle began.

Connie briefly stepped away and returned strumming a guitar and lip-synching to Geronimo, by the Australian band Sheppard.

Soon, various friends and family members entered as ballet dancers, street performers and cheerleaders got in on the action.

Finally, Bret got down on one knee and popped the question.

'Jovan, every bone in my body, every breath in my lungs wants to spend the rest of my life with you. It would be my honor if you would marry me,' he said.

'Would you marry me, Jovan?'

The bride-to-be tearfully said yes and the two embraced, as the crowd cheered and clapped.

According to E!, the couple met in Chicago, Jovan's hometown, then ran into each other the following week in Orlando.

After dating long-distance, Jovan moved to Los Angeles for Bret and hadn't seen her family or friends until the proposal.

The production was put together by NBC in promotion of its upcoming comedy Marry Me, which premieres Tuesday at 9pm.

The proposal video has garnered more than one million views on YouTube since it was posted Friday.
