Convicted: James Keaney pictured at the High Court Glasgow. He has been convicted of raping and physically abusing two women

A security guard has been convicted of raping and physically abusing two girlfriends.

One of his victims said that James Keaney, 36, went from 'nicey-nicey to monster'.

The High Court in Glasgow heard that the brutality began in each case when the women became pregnant.

One of the women aged 37, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was raped when she returned home from hospital with her baby.

Keaney, of Castlemilk, Glasgow, dragged the terrified woman across the kitchen floor and had sex with her against her will.

As he raped her Keaney said: 'That's what you get for having a child to someone else.'

This woman told prosecutor Paul Kearney that the abuse began early in her pregnancy and was like 'A blot out of the blue.'

She said: 'The first time was a slap which made my face swell up.'

After that she said that she was abused almost daily and regularly raped by Keaney.

Keaney, who was controlling, watched her when she went shopping and would interrogate her about anyone she spoke to.

If he didn't believe what she was telling him he would drag her about the house by the arm and hair.

Sick Keaney would also tie her up with belts and fling her in a hall cupboard.

His second victim aged 32, also suffered the same fate when she became pregnant.

Keaney would prevent her seeing her family. He would take the house keys with him and also put the baby's pram in his car.

He also listen in to her phone calls and she told the court: 'If I saw a boy I knew from school I wouldn't even look at him because of the accusations and interrogations that would follow.'

High court: The court heard that the two women did not know each other and both did not go to the police

Prosecutor Mr Kearney told the court: 'This was a clear course of conduct on his part characterised by intimidation and physical and sexual abuse in private behind locked doors.'

The court heard that the two women did not know each other and both did not go to the police.

They were both contacted during a police investigation.

Mr Kearney added: 'These women were strangers to each other yet gave similar accounts of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of the accused.

'Their only link was to have a relationship with a man who systematically lowered their self worth, belittled and assaulted them, controlled them, dominated them, assaulted them and raped them.'

Keaney was convicted of raping and physically abusing the two women. The offences were committed between 1996 and 2005 at addresses in Glasgow.

In evidence Keaney claimed both women were liars and had made up the allegations to get at him.

When asked by defence QC Garry Allan if his manner went - as one of his victims claimed - from 'nicey-nicey to monster' he replied: 'No, I don't conduct myself in that manner at all.'

Keaney was given bail by judge Norman Ritchie QC and will be sentenced next month.
