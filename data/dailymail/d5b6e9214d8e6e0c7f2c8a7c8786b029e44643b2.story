Roy Hodgson is likely to make changes for the dead rubber against Costa Rica on Tuesday - but he still needs to win the game to avoid humiliation.

Luke Shaw may get an early chance to fill the left-back berth in place of Leighton Baines and Ross Barkley may get a first start if England switch to a 4-3-3 - Raheem Sterling dropping out - to give them more solidity in midfield.Â

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is likely to emerge from the bench if his recovery from injury continues.

Hodgson, though, looks set to keep faith with the majority of the side which lost the opening two matches against Italy and Uruguay and condemned England to their first group-stage exit since 1958.

That means no start for the likes of Adam Lallana and Jack Wilshere - players who have been used as substitutes so far - and no sentimental inclusion for Frank Lampard.

Probable England XI against Costa Rica (4-3-3): Hart; Johnson, Cahill, Jagielka, Shaw; Barkley, Gerrard, Henderson; Rooney, Sturridge, Welbeck
