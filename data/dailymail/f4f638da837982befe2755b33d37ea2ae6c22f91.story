Elegant in a crimson coat and a matching tartan scarf, the Duchess of Cornwall was every inch the royal style icon as she welcomed HMS Astute back to port.

The Royal Navy submarine has just completed its first tour of duty and has spent the last eight months patrolling the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal.

Camilla, 67, who last week joined the Prince of Wales at the funeral of their friend, the Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, was greeted by Astute's Commanding Officer, Gareth Jenkins, as she arrived at HM Naval Base Clyde.

All smiles: Camilla, who is Astute's 'Lady Sponsor', was all smiles as she toured the submarine

Once there, the Duchess, who is known by her Rothesay title while in Scotland, was given a tour of the base, before being invited to board Astute.

Described by the Ministry of Defence as being 'more complex than a space shuttle', Astute is the first of the advanced Astute class submarines to go into service.

Despite early teething problems, including an incident in which the £1bn boat ran aground on rocks off the Isle of Skye during sea trials, the submarine is one of the deadliest ever built.

Carried on board the nuclear-powered Astute are 38 Spearfish heavy torpedoes and Tomahawk Block IV cruise missiles, the latter with the capacity to hit targets with 450kg of high explosive from 1,240 miles away.

The Duchess, who holds the honorary title of Lady Sponsor of HMS Astute, has long been associated with the vessel and officially launched it in 2007.

Camilla was also present for Astute's commissioning ceremony in 2010, when the submarine was officially given her HMS prefix and welcomed into the Royal Navy.

The vessel was finally declared fully operational in May, three months after leaving the UK on her maiden voyage.

Ambush, the first of Astute's sister ships, is also complete and scheduled to begin her maiden deployment before the end of 2014.

Although she does, like Astute, have a formidable number of military uses, Ambush has no royal sponsor, but is affiliated with the city of Derby.

Astute's home port, HM Naval Base Clyde, is also home to the UK's nuclear deterrent Trident and will also become the base for the remaining Astute class submarines, Artful, Audacious, Anson, Agamemnon and Ajax.

Maiden deployment: Astute has been patrolling the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal since February 

Advanced: Astute is one of the most technologically advanced submarines ever built in Britain

Powerful: The vessel carries Tomahawk Block IV missiles which can be fired from 1,250 miles distant

Like HM Naval Base Clyde, the Duchess is set for a busy few weeks, after it was announced that she and Prince Charles will embark on a tour of Mexico and Colombia at the end of October.

During the visit, the royal couple will join President Santos of Colombia for a ceremony in capital Bogotá to remember the estimated 200,000 victims of the drug-fuelled war that has plagued the country in recent decades.

In Mexico, the pair will travel to four different cities, including Real del Monte, a town that has close links with Cornwall and a taste for pasties as a result.
