MPs have been treated to expensive trips abroad and lavish days out through their membership of parliamentary special interest groups meant to bring issues of concern to the forefront of the political agenda.

The system allowing MPs to set up all-party parliamentary groups (known as APPGs) has come under fire after it emerged MP Patrick Mercer created one for Fiji after allegedly being paid thousands of pounds by lobbyists.

Mr Mercer even admitted in secretly recorded 
conversations that APPGs can be 'utterly useless' but could still be 
appealing to MPs seeking trips to exotic locations.

Globe-trotters: Among the most expensive trips funded in connection with APPGs was Conservative MP for Selby and Ainsty Nigel Adams' £8,578 visit to New Orleans in October which was funded by Eggborough Power Station in North Yorkshire

The Commons register of 
interests shows that 60 MPs have been on trips in connection with APPGs in 
recent months. The cost of the trips amount to £175,000 which has been funded by third parties such as banks, charities and oil companies.

APPGs have no 
legislative power, but are an effective way of bringing together 
parliamentarians with interested parties and lobbyists. They also allow campaign groups, charities, 
and other non-governmental organisations active in the field to become 
involved in discussions and influence politicians.

But while many MPs undertake educational
visits funded by a charity, NGO or private company as part of the work 
of an APPG, the 'cash-for-access' scandal has called into question 
whether the system is being abused.

According to the Sunday Telegraph, Conservative MP for Tamworth Chris Pincher took a four-day trip to Azerbaijan in connection with the country's APPG. The £2,975 trip was funded by the European Azerbaijan Society.

Tory MP for Harrow East Bob Blackman and Labour MP for Jarrow Stephen Hepburn appear to have joined Mr Pincher on the trip last July. 

The European Azerbaijan Society also funded trips for seven other MPs and spent about £1,000 for Labour MP for Slough Fiona Mactaggart to enjoy a day in a box within the royal enclosure at the Royal Windsor Horse Show in May last year.

Tory MP for Beverley and Holderness and chairman of the APPG on the global legislators organisation (Globe) Graham Stuart took a six-day trip to Rio de Janeiro to chair a session of the World Summit of Legislators. The £5,025.89 trip, which included flights and hotel expenses, in June last year was funded by Globe.

Tory MP for Maldon and chairman of the British Ukraine all-party parliamentary group John Whittingdale took a trip to Yalta for four days in September. The £2,520 trip was paid by the British Ukrainian Society.

One of the priciest trips to be funded in connection with an APPG was Conservative MP for Selby and Ainsty Nigel Adams' £8,578 visit to New Orleans in October which was funded by Eggborough Power Station in North Yorkshire.Meanwhile Simon Hughes, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, visited Cyprus and Turkey between May and June last year with funding of £920 - £740 of which was provided by the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.

Numerous governments have also funded MPs to visit their countries in connection with APPGs.

A review into APPGs was announced by the
Commons standards committee in January following a working group set up
by Speaker John Bercow whose recommendations included the need for 
'greater transparency'.

The 'cash-for-access' controversy has reignited calls for the Government to press ahead with promised legislation both for a statutory register of lobbyists and the power for constituents to 'recall' MPs who breach the rules.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has made clear his determination to secure the register - blaming the Tories for the lack of action.

Calling for cross-party talks on a register, shadow cabinet office minister Jon Trickett MP said: 'We have seen no action from this Tory-led Government, despite David Cameron himself warning that lobbying was the next great scandal waiting to happen.'

David Prince, interim chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said it warned in January that lobbying remained a 'significant and continuing risk to ethical standards' but that a register would not solve all the problems.
