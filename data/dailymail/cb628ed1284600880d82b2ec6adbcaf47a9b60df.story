Snuggling up to your loved one and enjoying a special dinner doesn't have to be exclusive to humans on Valentine's Day.

These amazing pictures show animals in the wild enjoying their own moments of romance on the day many couples celebrate their love for one another.

They were captured by British wildlife photographer, Margot Raggett, while staying at Entim Camp in Kenya's Maasai Mara National Reserve.

She has been a resident photographer at the camp after travelling there in 2010 and fell in love with both the place and the wildlife. 

She said: 'I am often very moved at the love you see in the animal world. Lions in particular are so strongly bonded they show their affection to each other all the time, greeting every time they've been apart even if for just a few minutes.'

Among the photo set are lions affectionately nudging each others heads, zebras standing together in pride and hippos enjoying a 'kiss'.
