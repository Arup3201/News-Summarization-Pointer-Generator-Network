Read Sportsmail's Graham Poll's damning verdict of the officiating during Chelsea and Everton clash at Goodison Park in August.

Linesman Ron Ganfield has been dropped from this weekend’s Barclays Premier League fixture list, less than a fortnight after being heavily criticised for his part in Chelsea’s 6-3 win over Everton.

Ganfield missed a series of key incidents in the match at Goodison Park, including a blatant handball outside of the area by Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard.

He also failed to flag an offside that should have seen Chelsea’s second goal by Branislav Ivanovic dismissed.

Errors: Assistant referee Ron Ganfield missed several key incidents at Goodison Park during Chelsea's win

Clear: Everton's keeper Tim Howard evidently held the ball outside the box but Ganfield missed the moment

Key mistake: Chelsea’s second goal by Branislav Ivanovic should have been dismissed for offside

The errors led Sportsmail’s Graham Poll to describe it as ‘the worst assistant refereeing performance I have ever seen’.

The Professional Game Match Officials Limited have not selected Ganfield for any top flight games after the international break on September 14, 15 and 16, but insist the decision has nothing to do with his performance on Merseyside.

‘We have 17 Select Group referees and 36 assistant referees, so there will always be rotation of them from week to week,' a PGMOL official told Sportsmail.

Huge win: Summer signing Diego Costa was instrumental with two goals as Chelsea won 6-3 at Everton

Appointments are pencilled in weeks ahead and routinely made available to the public on the Monday before the weekend’s fixtures.

Jon Moss, the referee from Chelsea's emphatic win over Everton on August 30, will act as fourth official for Arsenal's match with Manchester City once the Premier League football returns.
