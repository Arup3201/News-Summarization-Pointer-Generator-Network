A British woman who was allegedly kidnapped and gang-raped by three men in Dubai found herself in the dock for drinking without an alcohol licence.

The 28-year-old expatriate, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted to police she had been drinking when the alleged attack took place and was prosecuted and fined £169.

Under Islamic law in the United Arab Emirates, drinking without an alcohol licence is a crime.

Two of the Iranians accused of raping her are facing trial while a third defendant cannot be traced.

The woman, who works in a managerial position, said her ordeal lasted hours with the alleged rapists filming the attack and taunting her, despite her pleas to be let go.

Dubai Court of First Instance heard she was subjected to a sustained attack after being taken hostage and driven to a flat in Naif, a rundown area of Dubai.

She eventually escaped when the defendants left her on a mattress to find her own way home.

The defendants' lawyer Saeed al Gilani has claimed she made up the story after watching 'too many action movies'.

He added: 'She has a boyfriend who threw her out of his flat when he heard she'd had a relationship with the defendants. She then went to police and claimed she was raped.'

Prosecutors claimed the alleged victim had spent six hours at Rock Bottom, the same bar in Bur Dubai where missing Scottish sailor Timmy MacColl was last seen.

However the woman, who cannot be named, said that she was out with her boyfriend and he went home but realised he didn't have the keys to their flat.

She then went to Rock Bottom to meet a friend to get her car keys and because she was driving she said she did not have much to drink. It was at the bar that she believes her drink was spiked.

She left at 3am on July 6 and got into a cab, asking the driver to take her to Arabian Ranches residential area.

The 37-year-old Pakistani taxi driver told the court she was 'very drunk' and fell asleep on the back seat, but the victim believes that she appeared this way because of the drugs she had been spiked with.

Ordeal: The woman had visited a bar in Dubai and said said she was kidnapped by three Iranian 
men who claimed they knew her when she got out of a taxi

He said when she woke up, she changed
 her mind and told him to go to Jumeirah Beach Residence instead, 
stopping at a cash machine. She got out of the car but got back in 
without taking out any money.

When they finally reached their 
destination, he told how she stumbled inside without paying the £10 fare
 and had to be persuaded by security to return to the car.

Foreigners jailed in Dubai are deported immediately after completing their sentences.

The
 woman reportedly got into the driver's seat of the taxi, prompting him 
to remove his car keys, when a red Hyundai pulled up alongside them.

The three Iranian men in the car claimed they knew the woman, paid the taxi driver £17 and escorted her to their Hyundai.

She was taken to the apartment in Naif, where the three men allegedly took turns to rape her while filming the attack.

The woman said in a statement: 'I begged them to let me go but they didn't and were laughing at me.'

When she tried to escape by running 
toward the door and window, she was repeatedly dragged back onto a 
mattress, injuring her hand and foot, the court heard.

'They ignored my pleas and laughed at me, speaking to each other in broken English,' she said.

The men, all aged 20, left her dazed and lying on a mattress in the unlocked flat, giving her a chance to escape.

She caught a taxi back to her apartment at 8.30am, where her flatmate found her in a 'confused' state.

The 26-year-old friend said: 'She told me she had been raped. She changed her dress.

'We went to lodge a complaint at Rashidiya police station.'

The
 flatmate warned her not to shower before filing a complaint. Blood 
tests taken later that day did not show any traces of alcohol.

But
 judge Jamal Abdel Majeed, sitting in Dubai Misdemeanours Court, found 
the woman guilty of illegally consuming alcohol as she did not own an 
alcohol licence and admitted she had been drinking.

Two of the men accused of raping her are on trial but deny charges of kidnap and rape. The third man has not been traced.

Investigating
 officers said one of the accused, who has not been named, said he was 
'scared of kidnapping a British woman' but blamed his co-defendant for 
persuading him to carry out the attack by saying: 'She is drunk and 
won't recognise us.'

First 
corporal Marwan Salem, of Dubai police, said they lured her into their 
car by pretending the vehicle was hers. He added her underwear and 
belongings were found in the flat.

A forensic report showed she was injured during the alleged incident. The trial will continue on Wednesday.

Recruitment consultant Rebecca Blake, 29, (pictured) was sentenced to three months in a Dubai jail for having drunken sex in the back of a taxi. She was arrested earlier this year after partially stripping off in the back of the cab after a 10-hour drinking binge. DNA tests to find evidence of intercourse came back negative.

Last year, British tourist Lee Bradley Brown, 39, was allegedly beaten to death by officers in a Dubai police station after being arrested for swearing.

In 2010 Charlotte Adams, 26, from Essex, and Ayman Najafi, 25, of North London, were jailed for a 'peck on the cheek' in a restaurant.

Vince Acors, 35, and Michelle Palmer, 37, were convicted of public indecency and having unmarried sex while on a Dubai beach in 2008. They were jailed for three months and ordered to pay fines of £155 each.

BBC Radio One DJ Grooverider,(pictured) real name is Raymond Bingham, was jailed in 2008 for four years in Dubai after taking 2.16 grams of cannabis into the UAE. He was pardoned after serving seven months

British women, Sally Antia, 44, and Marnie Pearce, 40, have both been jailed for adultery in Dubai.

In 2009 Roxanne Hillier, 22, the daughter of a British businessman, served a three-month sentence in neighbouring Sharjah after she was accused of sleeping with the boss of the dive shop where she worked.
