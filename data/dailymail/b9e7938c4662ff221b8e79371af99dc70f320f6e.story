Angel di Maria doesn't often need to be carried by his team-mates, but on Friday Manchester United's British record signing hitched a lift to the training pitches with Juan Mata and David de Gea.

The former Real Madrid star, who moved to Old Trafford for £60million, has made a strong impression since arriving from Spain, with a goal in a superb  display in the win over Queens Park Rangers last weekend.

And the winger seems to be settling in well to life at United, joking around with his Spanish-speaking team-mates at United's Carrington training ground ahead of Sunday's Premier League clash against Leicester City and getting on the shoulders of Mata and then De Gea.

Goalkeeper David de Gea also gave Di Maria a lift during Friday's session, and United's record signing seemed to be having a great time 

Loan signing Radamel Falcao looked eager to kick-start his Manchester United career with a goal and could be set to make his first start at the King Power Stadium

Louis van Gaal's side will be keen to show that their dominant win against QPR was not only a one-off by being head and shoulders above Nigel Pearson's side at the King Power Stadium.

However, the Dutchman will know his team need to be at their best against a Leicester side who held Arsenal to a draw at home and beat Stoke City at the Britannia in their last outing.

The attacking display against QPR at Old Trafford was certainly impressive, with Di Maria to the fore, but centre back Jonny Evans insists that United have improved defensively as well, after a shaky start. 

Falcao looks delighted to be training with Louis van Gaal's side but will have an even wider smile if he can grab his first goal for the club against Leicester

Evans told United Review that the club's new defensive signings can have a major impact as the club look to continue a run of consecutive clean sheets. 

Luke Shaw, a £27million signing from Southampton, is expected to make his debut on Saturday, while Marcos Rojo had his first outing against QPR, and Evans is certain that they possess the quality to succeed at Old Trafford.

'I had the chance to work with Luke in pre-season,' said Evans. 'There is no doubt he is going to be the best left back in the world,'

'I watched Marcos at the World Cup and thought he was excellent for Argentina whether he played at left back or left wing back - and he can play centre back too,' he said.

Rojo is expected to start in a central role alongside Evans at Leicester for the first time since his move from Sporting Lisbon.

Giggs and Rooney appeared to be having a good time ahead of Friday's training session with the England captain looking in fine spirits
