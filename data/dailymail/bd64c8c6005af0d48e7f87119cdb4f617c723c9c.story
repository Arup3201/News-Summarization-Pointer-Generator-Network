An outraged all-girls private school student has claimed her yearbook photo was heavily retouched without her permission and now claims it looks like her 'prettier twin sister'. 

The student from the private St Teresa's Academy in Kansas City, Missouri, was furious when she saw the image as she believed it was beyond recognition.

She initially noticed the perceived problems with her picture when students were given their new ID cards - the images from which will be used in their end-of-year publication.

In response the teenager vented her anger by positing on Reddit, claiming that the pictures had been edited 'past smoothing out blemishes'.

Other pupils were also horrified at the changes, claiming that they had been made to look 'slimmer' on their cheek and face and had freckles removed from their nose. 

Before and after: The student, believed to be from St Teresa's Aacademy in Kansas City, Missouri, was furious when she saw the image that would be put in her yearbook was touched up without her permission

'I go to an all girls high school and today every senior got a new student ID. We had gotten one in the beginning of the school year and we were all unsure as to why we were given a second. After closer inspection we realized that our photos had be retouched far past smoothing out blemishes.

The student then listed what she believed had been done to the image including: Face smoothing, skin recoloring, lip recoloring, eyebrow smoothing and reshaping, and face thinning

The post continued: 'I was outraged! I have a round face that I have grown to love and now I get my photo back with a different face. The new photo no longer even looks like me but rather a prettier twin sister. 

'When we go and have our photos taken we are flat out told that our skin will be retouched to hide blemishes. We are not told, however, that more drastic changes are made.

'Going to an all girls school we are constantly reminded about positive body image and accepting ourselves for who we are. Having these changes made to make me appear thinner makes me wonder how must our school practices what they preach.'

The girl then met with her officials from her high school faculty who agreed that the untouched photos would be used in the yearbook.

The girl added: 'When our yearbook teacher saw the photos he was outraged along with all the other staff members of the school. They understood that the new edited photos are not what the students look like.

Response: The Catholic private school has said they did not ask for the photos to be edited and, following a meeting with students, have agreed to use the originals in the end-of-year publication

'I would like to thank all of the positive comments about how wrong this is and how there need to be changes in this. My school has proved that they are fully behind positive body image by printing the untouched photos.'

The student, who has not been named, was not alone as other students also criticized what had happened.

Senior Lily O’Neill, 17, a member of the yearbook staff told the Kansas City Star: 'My face was slimmer. My cheeks were slimmer. My neck was slimmer. … I didn’t have any freckles on my nose.

In response to the allegations, St. Teresa’s President Nan Tiehen Bone told the Star that it was a mistake on behalf of the photo company, DeCloud Studios.

She added that the school actually dissuades their students from wearing too much make up.

Susan Hoefer, from the DeCloud, admitted that an error had been made in the processing.

She told the paper: 'It’s very simple. The IDs were run through an automated retouching program, which they shouldn’t have been. It was an honest mistake.'
