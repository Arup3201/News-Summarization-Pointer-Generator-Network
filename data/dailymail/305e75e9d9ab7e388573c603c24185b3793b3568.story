A former middle school band teacher is facing up to three years in prison after pleading guilty to having sex with a 14-year-old student over a six-month period.

Bridgett Szychulski, 31, was the band teacher for the Lenape Middle School in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, at the time of the 2012 incident.

She pleaded guilty on Tuesday to charges of statutory sexual assault and aggravated indecent assault on a minor.

Szychulski is accused of having sex with the 14-year-old boy ‘at least’ three times - once in her vehicle and twice at the middle school, including her office and a storage room near the band room - and sending him lewd text messages.

Prosecutors say she could receive two to three years in prison when she is sentenced in about 90 days.

A judge deferred sentencing to allow an evaluation of whether she should be considered a sexually violent predator. The mother-of-two will remain free on bail while awaiting sentencing.

The investigation began in September after a tip to a child-abuse hotline.

Szychulski, who was pregnant at the time of her arrest, was suspended from her teaching duties in the Central Bucks district.

Szychulski, who is married and lives with her husband and two children in Philadelphia, had taught in the district for seven years and was most recently a band teacher at Central Bucks South High School.
