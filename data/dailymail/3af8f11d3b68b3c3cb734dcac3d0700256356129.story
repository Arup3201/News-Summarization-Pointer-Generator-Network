A man who underwent surgery to remove his 132lbs scrotum has said it has made his life a misery after the operation left him with a one-inch penis.

Wesley Warren Jr. was so desperate to rid himself of the ten stone testicles that he considered selling them on eBay to pay for the operation.

Fortunately for the 48-year-old a team of surgeons in California agreed to carry out the 13-hour operation for free - but Mr Warren is not happy about the results.

Unhappy: Wesley Warren expected his life to be transformed after he had his 132 lbs scrotum removed, but the surgery has left him 'disfigured'

Before the operation Mr Warren, from Las Vegas, struggled with the simplest of tasks and was forced to wear a hooded top as trousers to fit his giant scrotum.

Now however, he says he will never be able to have a relationship with a woman again after the surgery reduced his penis to an inch long.

'I know the majority of people are probably expecting me to express extreme happiness and glee that my life has been transformed since the sac has been removed - but it’s not as simple as that,' he told The Sun.

'I’m grateful to have been pulled out of the fire, I was getting burned, but now I’m dealing with the first degree burns. I’m still disfigured.'

Talking about his life before the operation he describes himself as a prisoner to his testicles and that the growth ruled his life.

'I could only walk in baby steps – I had to stop every 30 seconds,' he told the paper.

'It
 was just horrible. I couldn’t get in and out of a vehicle and even then
 I fell down on to the pavement and it took four grown men to try and 
lift me up.

He was so 
desperate to have the life-changing surgery that he considered 
auctioning off the sac online after it had been removed.

He
 explained to his surgegion, Dr Joel Gelman that he wanted to retain the
 giant scrotum to pay for his hospital bill, but fortunately Dr Gelman 
agreed to carry out the operation for free, which has been documented in
 a Bodyshock Special on Channel 4, to be shown on Monday.

'There
 are a lot of shows about makeovers, but this is a real makeover,' Dr. 
Gelman, who heads the Center for Reconstructive Urology at the 
University of California, Irvine, said of the procedure.

'He's basically a new man.'

On April 8, Dr Gelman and three other 
physicians cut away simultaneously on the grossly enlarged protective 
sac of skin and muscles that contained Warren's testicles and penis, 
according to the Las Vegas Review Journal.

The mass caused by the condition, known as scrotal lymphedema, had grown to 132 pounds in less than two years.

Mr Warren, who has blood pressure problems and asthma, had previously spoken of his fear of dying during surgery.

The watermelon-size scrotum Mr Warren 
carried between his legs landed him on the Howard Stern Show and Comedy 
Central and made him a local celebrity in his hometown.

When Warren spoke with a reporter for the Las Vegas Review-Journal in
 October 2011, he became emotional as he described the pain and 
humiliation of carrying the deformed genitals. He said he suffered from 
deep bouts of depression and health complications.

Fear: Warren was also afraid of dying on the operating table or losing his penis and his testicles if the complex procedure went wrong

His 
penis was buried so deeply in the abnormal growth that he was forced to 
urinate on himself and said only wanted to urinate like a normal man and have a romantic relationship with a woman.

'I don't like being a freak, who would?' he told the Review-Journal.

The
 massive swelling was caused by fluid building up in his scrotum. Doctors
 had to remove the excess tissue and then completely rebuild his 
scrotum.

There was 
also a chance that complications could force the surgeons to cut off his
 genitals if his scrotum didn't stop bleeding.

'I still haven't lost a patient or a testicle (in patients with problems similar to Warren's),' Dr Gelman told the Review Journal.

The extremely rare condition is much more common in Africa and Southeast Asia, where it is caused by parasites, than it is in the western world. 

Mr Warren says he contracted it somehow when he hit his testicle with his own leg while turning in bed one morning but Dr Gelman said he 'had no idea' how the man contracted it.

Wesley Warren's story will be shown in The Man With The 10-stone Testicles: A Bodyshock Special on Channel 4 on Monday, June 24 at 9pm
