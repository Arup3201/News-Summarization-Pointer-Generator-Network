This is the pretty policewoman and mother-of-two who was found brutally murdered and dumped in secluded woodland.

Detective Constable Heather Cooper, 33, was 
battered around the head with a baseball bat and stabbed in the throat 
before her body was dumped in Blackdown Forest, Sussex, and covered with leaves.

Her former partner Peter Foster was remanded in custody today, having been charged with murdering her at their £700,000 home on October 16.

Ms Cooper, who had recently given birth, was found in
the early hours of Monday morning by colleagues after concerns were 
raised about her safety over the weekend.

The picture, believed to have been taken several years ago, shows the mother-of-two in happier times.

Mr Foster, a former detective who worked for Surrey Police until he was made redundant, spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address at the brief two-minute hearing at Worthing Magistrates' Court.

He wore jeans and a T-shirt and showed no emotion as the murder charge against him was read out to the packed courtroom.

After being remanded in custody he thanked the magistrate. He is due appear before a Judge at Lewes Crown Court tomorrow for a preliminary hearing.

Police said a knife and a baseball bat had been discovered at the family home where they believe the murder took place.

A post-mortem examination showed Ms Cooper had sustained 'blunt force trauma to the head and an incised wound to the throat.'

Her
shocked family said in an emotional statement: 'As a family we are 
devastated by the loss of Heather in such tragic circumstances.

Police were called to the family's home in West Street, Haslemere on 
Sunday. Ms Cooper's' body was found four miles away in Tennyson Lane 
in Blackdown Woods

'She was a much-loved daughter, sister and granddaughter as well as a devoted mother to her children.

'Heather was popular amongst everyone she knew and we have been touched by all the flowers and tributes we have received from her friends and her colleagues.

'She was extremely proud to serve as a
police officer, often going above and beyond in her duty, and her 
dedication and professionalism was recognised and commended.

'Heather always had lots of energy, so much so her initials H.S.C. could have stood for "High Speed Cooper".

'She loved life and she lived it to the full.'

Surrey and Sussex Assistant Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney said: 'Heather's death has had a profound effect on all who knew her and we are doing everything we can to support her family at this difficult time.

'She was an exceptional officer and much loved among her police colleagues, many of whom were also her friends.

'The police service is in many ways like a family. The death of any officer is always a time of sadness but to lose Heather under such circumstances has been particularly hard to bear.

'I cannot praise enough the professionalism of Heather's friends and colleagues within the force, many of whom have continued to do their jobs at a time of personal grief.'
