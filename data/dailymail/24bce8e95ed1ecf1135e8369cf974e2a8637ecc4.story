Mystery: Paulina Starczewska's body had been buried on a campsite in Landsmeer, outside Amsterdam

A suspected killer buried a woman’s body underneath his caravan and lived above the corpse for five months, an extradition hearing was told.

Darius Majchrzak, 39, and his partner Samea Kubiak, 35, are accused of strangling Paulina Starczewska before hiding her body more than a decade ago.

The couple, who now live in the West Midlands, were only linked to the unsolved killing after Kubiak confessed to police when they attended a domestic incident outside their home.

She was flown to Holland and led officers to the body, which had been buried on a campsite in Landsmeer, outside Amsterdam.

Kubiak claimed Majchrzak had strangled the victim to death after trying to sexually assault both women following a booze and drug-fuelled party.

The couple had continued living at the campsite for another five months, despite the body being buried just yards away, she said.

A judge at Westminster Magistrates’ Court ordered Majchrzak should be extradited to the Netherlands to face a murder charge and an associated offence relating to unlawful burial.

Kubiak, who also faces similar allegations, will learn whether she will be extradited today.

The couple left the campsite for France shortly after the killing in early 2000, before settling in Dudley six years ago.

Both were arrested in May after police were called to a domestic incident outside their home in Occupation Street, Dudley.

Kubiak was initially treated as a witness but became a suspect after she returned to the UK, and was arrested by West Midlands Police on the request of Dutch authorities.

Ordering Majchrzak’s extradition, District Judge Michael Snow said: ‘It is apparent that the Dutch authorities knew nothing about the murder of Ms Starczewska until Ms Kubiak reported it to the police in May 2012.

‘After contact between the Dutch and UK authorities, Ms Kubiak travelled to Holland where she identified the location of the body of Ms Starczewska.’

The extradition request was not an abuse of process and complied with the European Convention on Human Rights, he added.

Majchrzak has seven days to appeal the decision and has been remanded in custody pending his removal to Holland.
