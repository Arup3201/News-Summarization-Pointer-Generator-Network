A teenager who killed herself the day after a social worker assessed her as not posing a high risk to herself was 'failed by professionals from all agencies', a damning report says.

Helena Farrell, 15, hanged herself at a beauty spot near her home in Kendal, Cumbria on January 4, 2013, the day after she was seen by a social worker at Cumbria's Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS).

The teenager, a pupil at Kirkbie Kendal School, in Kendal, was academically very able and gifted in sports and music, playing hockey and also attending the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester.

Helena Farrell was 'failed by professionals from all agencies', according to a new report into her death

Helena's father, Enda Farrell, and his wife, Maria, feel their daughter was let down by by the system

An inquest into her death heard last week that Helena, who had suffered from bulimia after and alleged sex attack on a school trip and who was upset over a failed relationship, had taken an overdose, self-harmed, and written letters of farewell to friends of relatives

But Helena, whose mother, Maria, is a GP, had not been deemed to be a risk to herself, and a referral to a mental health service near her home led to no action being taken for a month.  When she did see a CAMHS social worker, she was judged to be posing no imminent risk to herself.

A new report of a review into Helena's death and the events leading up to it was published today by Cumbria Local Safeguarding Children Board.

The report, in which Helena is referred to as 'Child J', slams the social workers who dealt with her for blaming her behaviour on 'a normal histrionic adolescent response' to her failed relationship.

It says: 'The failure of professionals from all agencies to recognise the full extent of Child J's difficulties and take protective action is at first baffling in the face of mounting evidence that she was at high risk of suicide.'

The 42-page review identified a 'lack of knowledge among a range of professionals' about the evidence for high-risk indicators for teenage suicide leaving them 'ill-equipped' to recognise the signs and respond accordingly.

Let down: Helena displayed 'mounting evidence that she was at high risk of suicide', the review report said

And it said there was a 'lack of appreciation of the "inner world of teenagers"' and 'false reassurance' that children would receive the help they needed.

The report also questioned whether health professionals relied on the ability of Helena's parents, 'apparently engaged, professional parents', to protect her, and whether this affected their judgement in deciding on the need for intervention in Helena's case.

Helena's parents, Enda and Maria Farrell, who are originally from Galway, Ireland, have said they felt their daughter was let down by the system supposed to help children and young people suffering mental anguish.

And during the inquest last week, Coroner for south and east Cumbria, Ian Smith, heard that the CAMHS was in disarray.

Richard Simpson, assistant director (children's services) for Barnardo's Cumbria and chairman of Cumbria Local Safeguarding Children Board at the time of the report's writing, said: 'The review report asks some serious and difficult questions for which there are few simple or straightforward answers.

The teenager's problems had been written off as 'normal, histrionic adolescent response' by professionals

'It is impossible to guarantee that a situation like this will not happen again, but the action plan that has been developed is our considered response to the findings and outlines the steps that will be taken to minimise that risk as far as possible.

'When any child dies it is a tragedy, but especially so in these circumstances. If there are families or young people out there struggling with similar issues, I strongly encourage them seek out help.'

NHS Cumbria Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) clinical GP lead, children and safeguarding, Dr Amanda Boardman, said: 'Helena was a beautiful and talented young lady and will be deeply missed by all that knew her.

'Working with our partners, we are responding to the changing needs of children and teenagers in a world unrecognisable 20 years ago.

'The explosion of social media and pressures felt by young people has never been greater, and we are adapting and changing the services designed to protect children and young people to meet their needs.'
