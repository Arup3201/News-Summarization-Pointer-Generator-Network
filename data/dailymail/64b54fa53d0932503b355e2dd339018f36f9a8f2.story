James Thompson: He died on the same day as the Alps massacre. Now his daughter Joy Martinolich wants his remains to be exhumed

The body of the secret  ex-husband of an Alps massacre victim should be exhumed to find out if he was poisoned, his daughter said yesterday.

Joy Martinolich wants the remains of James Thompson to be dug up by the FBI and tested for evidence that he did not die of a heart attack as has long been thought.

She also appealed for the French police to contact her family to ‘eliminate my father from the investigation’ and find out who was the target of the mass shooting.

Miss Martinolich spoke out after a French detective identified her father as having been married to Iqbal Al-Hilli, 47, between February 1999 and December 2000.

Mrs Al-Hilli, a Briton of Iraqi origin, was shot dead on September 5, 2012 along with her  50-year-old husband Saad  Al-Hilli, her mother Suhaila  al-Allaf, 74, and French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45.

Their daughters Zainab, seven at the time, and Zeena, who was four, survived the attack, which happened in a forest in the French Alps near Lake Annecy.

On the same day, Mr Thompson, a former oil industry worker from Natchez, Mississippi, died aged 60 in the US after slumping at the wheel as he drove home. He suffered from high blood pressure and was said officially to have died from a heart attack. 

But Benoit Vinnemann, a senior French detective, has raised the possibility that Mrs Al-Hilli’s covert relationship with Mr Thompson may have provided a motive for the murders.

And Miss Martinolich, 38, said that in light of the potential link to such a mysterious case, she wants his body examined.

She said that no autopsy was carried out on Mr Thompson, meaning questions about potential toxins in his system remain unanswered.

Miss Martinolich said her family might be divided about whether to go forward with the exhumation. Her brother Joshua would probably oppose it and she was not sure about her aunt Judith Weatherly.

But she said: ‘I would not have a problem with the exhumation for the simple fact that the corpse there is not my father, it’s just the shell of him.

‘If there is something in his body I would want to know what it is. If the FBI agree, I would comply with it.’

There are a range of theories about why the Al-Hillis, of Claygate, Surrey, were targeted.

The family originally came from Iraq, and one theory is that their links to the regime of former dictator Saddam Hussein may be a reason for their murders.

There have also been claims that Mr Al-Hilli was involved in a dispute over a family inheritance with his brother Zaid Al-Hilli, 54, of Chessington, Surrey.

Last year he was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder but then released because of a complete lack of evidence.

In
 February Eric Devouassoux, 48, a former policeman from the Annecy area,
 was also arrested over the killings and spent four days in custody.

The
 gun collector is still being investigated for arms trafficking, but 
there has been no legal action linked to the four murders.

Investigators
 say that whoever carried out the crime is likely to be a trained 
marksman, and to know the local area well. Miss Martinolich said: ‘If 
the French police get in contact we will help them in any way.

‘Do they even know who was the intended target? It could have been Iqbal.

‘Eliminating my father from the investigation and knowing he had a heart attack would be something we would like to know.’

Miss Martinolich said her father married Iqbal, a dentist, so that she could get a green card and live in the US. In exchange, she bought him a Honda car and fixed his teeth.

But she returned to the UK because she was homesick and her family did not want her to marry outside her culture.
