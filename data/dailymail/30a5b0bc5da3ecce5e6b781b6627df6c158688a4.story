A gang that allegedly specialized in organized, armed and violent crime that were often referred to as 'Joloperros' - Spanish for 'stick-up guys' - will finally go to trial this summer for their role in the elaborate kidnapping and assault of two men in Boston.

The FBI says the 'Veloz Crew' - headed by Danny Veloz, who is known as 'The Maestro' - went to elaborate lengths to kidnap a man they believed to be a major dealer of homemade Percocet pills, which deliver a heroin-like high.

The plot was one of many underground kidnappings that police say targeted dealers in order to obtain large ransoms of cash or drugs, believing that going after criminals reduced the risk of involving authorities.

The Joloperros tagged the victim's car with a GPS tracker and monitored his movements for months on a big-screen TV inside Veloz's house,The Boston Herald reported.

Elaborate plot: The FBI says the 'Veloz Crew', headed by Danny Veloz  (left), planned the July 2012 kidnapping for weeks, targeting a man they believed was a major dealer in homemade Percocet and pretending to police and wearing skeleton masks when they abducted the victim

'Kidnap bag': The gang would pose as police, or use skeleton masks to disguise themselves, before swiping their targets off the street, sometimes in broad daylight

The tracking device would call Veloz's cellphone once the target's car started moving. 

On July 12, 2012, they were ready to pounce.

The gang had a kidnap bag full of police shirts, skeleton masks and guns.

According to The Herald, Jose Guzman, Henry Maldonado, Thomas Wallace, Luis Reynoso, and Gadiel Romero all suited up and got into  a white Toyota minivan. 

Veloz, the leader, was on the phone to Guzman from another location. 

As the victim pulled into his driveway about 7 p.m., the abductors pulled in behind and came out with guns.

Both the target and the man he was with were abducted.

The target was hit in the head with a handgun, causing 'blood to spray throughout the van,' according to an affidavit. 

The two were taken to Maldonado’s apartment in Manchester, N.H., where the crew demanded payment.

The target victim refused to cooperate, and was beaten and burned with a hot iron, the affidavit said.

He suffered several burn injuries.

However the victim was lucky enough to escape through a bathroom window and found his way to a neighbor's house for help. 

Police descended on the property arrested three suspects who were leaving the premises.

Another suspect was found hiding, according to Fox 25.

Inside the alleged kidnapper's apartment, authorities found their tools of the trade: police gear, a mask and guns. Four irons were also seized, one of which "appeared to have human flesh on it," records show. 

Police in Boston have been focusing on this case and others like for over two years. 

Lawrence Mayor Daniel Rivera told The Herald: 'Today we are adding more police officers and we’re making this place inhospitable for those guys to do business here. ... We have to fight the crime that we have every day, but in order to ensure that this doesn’t ever happen again, we have to create an environment where every family feels safe by putting enough police officers on the street.'
