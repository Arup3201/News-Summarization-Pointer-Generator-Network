Battle: MP Tim Yeo is fighting to save his political career following the Commons sleaze inquiry

The plot to sack veteran Tory MP Tim Yeo gathered pace last night after 12 members of his constituency party executive issued a public call for him to quit politics.

They challenged Mr Yeo’s claim he was ‘exonerated’ in a Commons sleaze inquiry. They also accused him of neglecting his constituency.

The new attack is led by South Suffolk Conservative Association members Nick Antill, the treasurer, and businessman Simon Barrett.

They have written to Conservative MPs who support Mr Yeo.

Mr Yeo was deselected by the local association executive in a secret ballot in November.

But he has asked for a ballot of local party members, which if they back him would trump the executive.

‘There is a common feeling he has not spent enough time in his constituency,’ say the local activists.

The ‘Yeo must go’ letter criticises his speech to an executive meeting of the association where he was asked about claims he abused his position as chairman of the Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee to help environmental companies lobby Ministers. 

Mr Yeo said he was ‘totally exonerated’ by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, who said he had not broken any rules.

But the letter says the Commissioner warned that the affair had ‘affected his reputation’ and he ‘should consider more carefully his comments in future’.

Ballot papers to 600 members of South Suffolk Conservatives are being sent out this weekend. Mr Yeo’s fate will be announced on February 3. 

Mr Yeo last night stood by his claim that he was ‘exonerated’ by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner.

Asked about other criticisms by activists, he said: ‘I look forward to the result of the ballot.’ 

Mr Yeo said he was ‘extremely surprised’ at the claims made by the 12 executive rebels. 

‘The letter’s contents contradict repeat allegations now exposed as completely false and are not relevant to the executive’s decision about my reselection,’ he said.
