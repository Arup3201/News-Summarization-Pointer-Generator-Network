A schoolgirl threw herself under a train after receiving a text message from a boy cancelling a trip to the cinema, an inquest heard yesterday.

Gabrielle Joseph, 16, told friends on Facebook: ‘I am going to kill myself tonight’ because she was so upset at being turned down for the date, due on the following night.

The young model died little more than an hour later.

'Devastating loss': Gabrielle Joseph dreamed of a career as a fashion model and had begun putting together a portfolio

Gabrielle was described as a ‘bubbly’ 
and ‘outgoing’ teenager with a busy life attending college and holding 
two part-time jobs, including one at the popular Hollister fashion 
store.

She had ambitions of being a top 
model, and on her own website wrote: ‘In order to be irreplaceable, one
 must always be different.’

Her father Terry described her as being ‘groggy and pale’ on the day of her death near her home in Briton Ferry, South Wales.

An inquest heard that she had been 
left ‘distressed’ by the text at 8.15pm last Easter Monday cancelling 
the date and that 75 minutes later she died from multiple injuries after
 she was hit by the train near her home.

Gabrielle wrote a three-page Facebook 
message to friends telling of her upset at the text from a boy who 
cancelled their movie date for the next night.

Within an hour she was hit by the 75mph Milford Haven to Cardiff train.

'Happy-go-lucky': Gabrielle, pictured enjoying a night out with fellow models from clothing chain Hollister, posted a message on Facebook before her death

Coroner Philip Rogers gave copies of the message to the jury but he did not read it aloud.

He said: ‘The last part of the message is a clear indication on Gabby’s part that she is going to take her own life.’

The jury in Swansea returned a verdict
 of suicide. Gabrielle, who was studying for her A-levels and lived with
 mother Julie, a hairdresser, and father Terry, worked at the Hollister 
fashion chain where staff are referred to as ‘models’.

Weeks before her death her portrait had been chosen as an image of the week by Digital Photographer magazine.

One colleague at Hollister said: ‘She was known in the store as a happy, party girl. She was absolutely 
lovely, we will all miss her.’

Tributes: Friends left tributes at Briton Ferry railway station where the teenager was found dead on Easter Monday in April

Her mother said in April following the death: ‘She was the most beautiful girl in the world, both inside and out.

‘Nothing will take away the pain and 
devastation this has brought to us as a family. We wouldn’t want anyone 
to go through this.’

A statement from her family after the inquest said they were ‘devastated by the loss of our precious Gabrielle’.

It added: ‘We have received an 
overwhelming amount of support from family and friends, to whom we will 
always be extremely grateful.

‘We are trying to move forward  
positively by attempting to increase awareness and understanding of the 
issues surrounding youth suicide and the impact it has on those left 
behind.

‘We would like to take this 
opportunity to urge young people to share their problems by talking to 
someone they trust. No problem is insurmountable and there is always 
help available.’
