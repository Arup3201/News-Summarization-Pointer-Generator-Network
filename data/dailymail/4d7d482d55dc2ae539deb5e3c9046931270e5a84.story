After crossing the border into Texas, illegal immigrants face a long, dangerous trip through hot desert scrub brush before reaching civilization. Not all of them make it.

On Monday, the remains of one immigrant was found under a mesquite tree on a ranch near Falfurrias, Texas. A Breitbart Texas reporter was present as a local sheriff's deputy arrived to oversee the scene.

The body was found picked apart by wild animals. The skull was ten feet away from the rest of the body.

Horrific: The skull of an illegal immigrant was found ten feet from the rest of his body after it was picked apart by wild animals

The remains were found under a mesquite tree on a remote part of a ranch in rural Brooks County in South Texas

The body was one of 41 already discovered this year in rural Brooks County, a rural area of South Texas that is 944 square miles and home to just 7,200 people. There were 12 found in June alone.

One sheriff's deputy says only one in ten immigrants who die crossing the border are ever found.

This body was discovered by workers on Cage Ranch outside Falfurrias. Another illegal immigrant told Border Patrol officers about finding the remains, according to Breitbart.

The Brooks County Sheriff's Office confirmed to MailOnline that officers discovered a body believed to be an illegal immigrant at the ranch on Monday.

The Border Patrol searched and discovered the body under a tree - a 30-minute drive up a winding, rough dirt road.

Authorities said immigrants usually die from a combination of heat exhaustion and thirst.

It's not yet clear what happened to the person who was found in Falfurrias this week.

The remains of more than 160 migrants were found in a mass grave in Falfurrias. The immigrants were all found dead across the county

Authorities say the immigrants are often lied to by the coyotes who help smuggle them across the border. The traffickers often tell immigrants they have just a short hike to meet people who will help them get settled in the U.S.

Instead, they are in for miles and miles of trekking through the desert.

The deaths of so many immigrants puts a financial strain on tiny Brooks County, which is also one of the poorest in Texas. 

For each one found, the country must spent $2,500 for the medical examiner to review the remains and for a funeral home to bury them.

In recent years, a mass grave was found in Falfurrias - with remains haphazardly buried - some in plastic shopping bags, others piled with several bodies on top of each other. 

Authorities are investigating a local funeral home over allegations it mishandled the burial of more than 160 migrants.
