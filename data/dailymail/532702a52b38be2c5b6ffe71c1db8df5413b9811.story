Car giant Volvo is developing 'no death' cars that drive themselves and are impossible to crash – ready for launch in showrooms within eight years.

The computerised vehicles will  be fitted with high-tech sensors and will 'refuse to be steered' into other objects.

Volvo says they will be  on sale to customers by 2020, but that some of the life-saving technology will be incorporated into its vehicles even earlier – from 2014 – it says.

Key elements of the Highway Code are to be re-written to stop driverless cars bringing gridlock, pictured Volvo S40s have been  fitted with dozens of sensors allowing it to monitor pedestrians and other traffic

Sensors will also work at high speeds, ensuring the car is a safe distance from surrounding vehicles

Ford’s global  chairman Bill Ford 
Jnr,  great grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford, announced earlier
 this year that motorists will soon be able to tell their car ‘switch 
to auto-pilot’.

He stressed that much of the 
technology was already being developed, trialled and tested at Ford 
engineering and  research  centres, such as at Aachen in Germany and 
Dunton in Essex. Mr Ford predicts:

Volvo's head of government affairs 
Anders Eugensson said: ‘Our vision is that no one is killed or injured 
in a new Volvo by 2020.’

Swedish-based
 Volvo  - now owned by China's Geely group - said the first versions of 
its crash-free cars would meant for driving in towns at a maximum speed 
of 31mph.

It
 is part of the race by leading car manufacturers including Volvo, Ford
 Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Vauxhall and even Google to build fully automomous 
‘Robo-cars’ that can drive themselves – like the one which actor Will 
Smith drove in the sci-fi movie ‘I, Robot.’

The
 biggest hurdle is not the technology which is largely developed – but 
public acceptance of it and and issues of who would be liable if a 
crashproof car did actually crash: the driver or the manufacturer?

Volvo’s
 Mr Eugensson said;’We have tested prototypes on thousands of miles of 
test drives on public roads in Spain and on the company's test track in 
western Sweden.

‘The car of the future will be like the farmer's horse.'

'The farmer can steer the horse and carriage but if he falls asleep the horse will refuse to walk into a tree or off a cliff.’

The
 85-year-old company - which has always prided itself on producing the 
world's safest cars and developed the three-point seat-belt - said it 
hoped to launch the first vehicles in 2014 at speeds of up to 31 mph – 
for use in heavy urban traffic -  with totally accident free vehicles at
 higher speeds by 2020.

Moves
 are already underway to amend international law under the Vienna 
Convention on Road traffic which would remove current blocks on fully 
autonomous vehicles.

he convention, which underpins EU and UK law, says the driver must be in control of the vehicle at all times.

New technology means that need not be the case.

Volvo
 has had 50 engineers working with automotive partners such as Ricardo 
U.K. on the new crash-proof car technology over the last several years.

Its
 prototypes have run thousands of miles of test drives on public roads 
in Spain and on the company’s test track in western Sweden.

Marcus Rothoff, head of developing 
Volvo’s driver assistance technology said: 'We are convinced this is the
 future and we want to get there first’.

Volvo has built some of the collision sensors into its current S40, and plans to have more advanced systems in cars by 2014

For sceptics who say it’s pie in the 
sky, industry experts and bosses  point out that the same was said of 
satellite-navigation, air-bags, self-parking car systems, sensors which 
‘see’ white lines and  keep vehicles in their motorway lanes, collision 
avoidance and  autonomous cruise control that brakes automatically the 
car if it comes to close to the vehicle in front - all of which are 
features on cars  sold in showrooms today.

Mercedes-Benz’s next generation 
flagship  S-Class which goes on sale next early year. Incorporates a 
self-braking system that operates at speeds of up to 124 mph on German 
motorways, as well as in towns.

US internet search engine Google has also been testing its own prototype of a self-driving car since 2010.

Volvo
 is also working on a system  to enable motorists  to safely  and 
legally read, send e-mails make phone calls or have a snooze while 
driving at the wheel under a new ‘commuter car ’ system it  has 
developed. 

It turns convoys of vehicles into self-driving ‘road-trains.’

The Swedish car maker’s project 
permits  lines of up to six cars dive autonomously almost bumper to 
bumper  while driver switches off, does some office work, reads a book 
or has a snooze while letting the road-train convoy  take the strain.

Each car’s braking, acceleration 
and steering is instead all controlled electronically by a lead  truck –
 driven by a professional driver -  at the head of the line.

The truck uses  radio signals to control the cars behind it.

All the vehicles are fitted with  a
 special computerised control unit fitted to their engine management 
systems to tell the car when to accelerate, brake and steer without any 
input from the driver.

Once a vehicle is ‘locked on’  to 
the convoy a system of lasers and sensors helps keep the cars a safe 
distance from one another.

The technology has been developed for Volvo by British firm Ricardo.

Drivers can signal their intention 
to leave the convoy and resume control of the car by simply pressing a 
button on the dashboard.

Volvo has spent the last three 
years working on the Safe Road Trains for the Environment project known 
as SARTRE – in a play on the name of the French existentialist 
philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre who famously and here fittingly  said: 
‘Hell is other people’ and ‘Man is condemned to be free. ’

Volvo has begun testing the driverless-car technology. Here, a driver drinks tea as his car automatically drives itself, keeping a safe distance from the lorry in front

It has been made possible thanks to £5.1million of funding from the European union.

Experts say self-drive cars are potentially safer because they take the risk of human error out of motoring.

Volvo says the car train is ideal for lengthy motorway journeys.

Not only do drivers make better use of their time, but the smoother journey cuts fuel consumption by 20 per cent.
