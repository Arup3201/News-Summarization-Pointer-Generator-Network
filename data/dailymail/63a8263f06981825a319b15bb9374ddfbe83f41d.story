A New York theater is ignoring the age rating of a film with explicit lesbian sex scenes and allowing viewers under the age of 17 to watch it.

One scene in Blue Is the Warmest Color includes a no-holds-barred twelve minute 
erotic sex sequence between two women, played by Lea Seydoux and Adele 
Exarchopoulos, that leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination.

But the IFC Center in Greenwich Village has said it will not turn 
away teen-aged viewers.

Decision: The IFC Center in Greenwich Village has said it will not turn away teen-aged viewers

The theater falls under the same corporate umbrella as Sundance Selects reported The New York Times.

In a statement, John Vanco, senior veep and general manager of the IFC Center, said that 'high school age patrons 'would be admitted.'

'This is not a movie for young children, but it is our judgment that it is not inappropriate for mature, inquiring teenagers who are looking ahead to the emotional challenges and opportunities that adulthood holds,' Vanco said.

The theater added on Thursday: 'The 
MPAA rating is a voluntary guideline that we as a theater are not 
obligated to enforce. In this case we feel it is unnecessarily 
restrictive and we will indeed admit high school age patrons to 
screenings of this perceptive and moving film at the IFC Center.'

Flicks Theatre in Boise, Idaho, has also announced that they will not be screening the film.

The owner told The Hollywood Reporter
'It isn't because we're prudes,' but said the decision was made because
the theater's liquor license prohibits it from showing films featuring 
'acts of simulated acts of sexual intercourse'

The
steamy three-hour movie about a young lesbian love affair was awarded 
the prestigious Palme d’Or award at the Cannes Film Festival earlier 
this year.

Since then 
Seydoux has accused director Abdellatif Kechiche of being difficult to 
work with on set and said she would not work with him again.

She
told the Daily Beast that she felt 'trapped' on the set iand that she 
didn't feel respected while shooting the film's racy sex scenes.

She
said: [Kechiche] became so crazy that he picked up the little monitor 
he was viewing it through and threw it into the street, screaming, “I 
can’t work under these conditions!”'

But
Kechiche hit back in an open letter slamming his outspoken star: 'Miss 
Seydoux, who after having repeatedly thanking me publicly and privately 
and having wept in my arms at Cannes for allowing her to take on this 
noble role … has, against all odds and all personal coherence, radically
changed her attitude towards me.'
