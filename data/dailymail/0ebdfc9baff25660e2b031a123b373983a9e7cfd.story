There comes a time when, however glamorous you are, the only thing that matters is being comfortable.

And frankly, if you can’t wear a purple tracksuit and a straw hat when you’re nearly 73, when can you?

Faye Dunaway was perfectly happy to opt for comfort over style as she left the Dorchester Hotel in London following a lavish New Year’s Eve party thrown by Prince Azim of Brunei.

Perhaps she’d had a little too much fun though – she wasn’t wearing a scrap of make-up, and her eyes looked tired beneath the brim of her hat.

The actress, most famous for her role opposite Warren Beatty in 1967 film Bonnie And Clyde, was flown over to London from the U.S. as a guest of the 31-year-old billionaire playboy prince.

Other celebrities at the party included Stephanie Beacham and John Travolta.

Miss Dunaway, who turns 73 later this month, was photographed on New Year’s Day as she prepared to return to Los Angeles, where she lives in a modest three-bedroom bungalow – despite being able to charge £1million a film.
