A 57-year-old Manhattan housewife has been arrested for allegedly offering an undercover officer posing as a hit man $60,000 worth of German stamps as payment for killing her unemployed husband in a dispute over money.

Elena Sava Adams was arrested in Brooklyn Thursday during a meeting with a man she thought to be an assassin to discuss the hit, which was supposed to take place Sunday.

According to investigators, Mrs Adams wanted to have her spouse, 66-year-old Irving Adams, run over by a car because she believed that he had been hiding a substantial sum of money from her after losing his job as chief compliance officer at Israel Discount Bank of New York.

Motive: Mrs Adams allegedly suspected her unemployed banker husband of hiding money from her and wanted to collect his insurance policy after his death

Police say that Mrs Adams initially shared her plan to have her husband eliminated with a friend, who in turn went to the authorities, CBS New York reported.

As part of Elena Adams' alleged plot, she and her husband, who live in lower Manhattan, were supposed to have lunch at a restaurant Sunday near Avenue Z and East 11th Street in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn.

Police say that if her plan had worked, Mr Adams would have been struck and killed by a vehicle driven by the assassin while crossing the street with his wife, who then would have been able to collect his accidental death insurance policy.

On Thursday, Elena Sava Adams, a Romanian national, arrived in Sheepshead Bay to meet up with the undercover investigator from the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office posing as a hit man.

Payment: Elena Adams allegedly offered the bogus assassin $60,000 worth of rare German stamps (not pictured) for the contract

Prosecutors say the 57-year-old handed him a photo of her husband, $10,000 in jewelery and a collection of German postage stamps she said were worth $60,000.

Unbeknownst to Adams, her rendezvous with the would-be assassin held inside his car on Shore Parkway was recorded.

'It would look legitimate, just like an accident,' Elena allegedly told the officer, according to the prosecutor. 'If I'm lucky, you will make extra.’

Moments later, she was arrested by police and hauled off to the nearby 61st Precinct.

Officials say the Manhattan resident chose Sheepshead Bay as the location for her husband's assassination because she believed there were fewer surveillance cameras in Brooklyn than in New York City.

On Friday, Elena Adams was charged with conspiracy and solicitation charges in connection to the failed murder-for-hire plot, the New York Daily News reported. A judge ordered Adams held without bail and warned her to stay away from her husband.

The Adamses lived in the same high-rise apartment building in Battery Park City where New York city Commissioner Ray Kelly resides, the New York Post reported.

The middle-aged couple have been described as odd by some of their neighbors, one of whom told the site DNAInfo.com that the two lived on a diet of Krispy Kream donuts and pizza.

The unnamed resident added that even though it has been reported that Irving Adams has been out of work for the past five years, he and his wife appeared to be far from destitute, jetting off to ski vacations in Colorado several times a year.

The man said that Elena Adams even showed him photos from her trips on her phone, and once mentioned that she owns a house in Romania.

According to another account from a neighbor who spoke to the New York Daily News, the Adamses’ relationship was far from ideal, saying that the wife would talk on the phone in the hallway because she could not stand to be in the apartment with her husband.
