Manchester United's stars have continued to drive their Merecedes, Porsches and Range Rovers to and from training - despite club sponsors Chevrolet shipping in a fleet of vehicles specifically for that purpose.

The American manufacturer was hoping to gain some publicity from the likes of Wayne Rooney, Angel Di Maria and Radamel Falcao sitting behind the wheel of their cars.

But the transporter lorry-load of 15 - including Chevrolet Camaros and Stingrays - delivered in April sit unused in a corner of the Carrington car park.

It's embarrassing for the club's hierarchy because Chevrolet pay £47m-a-year to have their names adorning United's shirts.

Despite the shipment of free cars, United's squad continue to drive their own to and from training every day.

Rooney and Di Maria have Range Rovers, Robin van Persie has a Porsche 911 while Juan Mata and Luke Shaw drive 4x4s.

Manager Louis van Gaal does drive a Chevrolet Captiva - a 4x4 - but it is his own.

A United club source confirmed that the fleet of cars sent by Chevrolet are used only by the training ground staff.

A Chevrolet spokesman insisted that the players were under no obligation to drive the cars provided, calling it a 'voluntary drive programme.'

United signed the £350m, seven-year deal with Chevrolet in July 2012 as a replacement for Aon and the car maker's logo started appearing on their shirts this season.
