Arrest: Randy Johnson, 51, allegedly kidnapped and sexually assaulted a teenage girl

A 51-year-old man who allegedly kidnapped a 14-year-old girl with Down syndrome has now been charged with sexual assault.

Randy Johnson was arrested at a trailer park in Harlingen, Texas on Wednesday morning after the girl vanished from her family's home 350 miles away in Magnolia on Monday.

Her family is now traveling south to meet the girl, who was taken to hospital after the arrest. Her mental disabilities cause
 her to act like a five or six year old, her family previously said.

'She is fine, she is a little scared, because no one is with her,' her father told KHOU. 'They asked us if we can head down there to pick her up.'

Her mother added: 'I just want to hug her. That's it. I just want to wrap her in my arms and hug her and not let her ever go.'

The girl, whom MailOnline is not naming because she is the alleged victim of a sexual assault, has Down Syndrome, autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD).

Police had issued an Amber Alert earlier this week after the teenager vanished on Monday and authorities were able to track Johnson down using his cell phone.

Johnson, who had worked with the victim's father, moved into her family's home after suffering from colon cancer.

But after eight months, they kicked him out for getting 'too close' to their daughter.

'We were literally listening to every conversation, and it was in code,' her mother said. 'So once we decided what the codes were, it was like, you have to go, you can't be here.'

On Monday, she went outside to check the mail but never came home, and witnesses said they had last seen her by the mailbox on a cell phone.

The teenager's aunt said that she had recently taken a cell phone from the girl, so Johnson must have given her another one.

After she disappeared, her parents said they received a call from Johnson.

'He
 calls us and says, "Y'all will never see her again" and 
things like that,' her father said. '"Where we're going you 
can't get there". Not even ten minutes later he calls back and goes, 
"La-la-la-la".'

The parents 
added that Johnson claimed he was going to be passing through a 
checkpoint, but pointed out that the family had no IDs to be able to do 
the same.

Johnson was at the Cameron County Jail on Wednesday, being held on kidnapping charges and aggravated sexual assault of a child.

He is expected to be 
extradited to Montgomery to face official charges.
