Fernando Torres insists Atletico Madrid can threaten the duopoly of Barcelona and Real Madrid in 'any competition' - ahead of Wednesday night's Copa del Rey clash with Lionel Messi and Co.

The former Chelsea and Liverpool striker appeared to end years of torment by returning to his first club and scoring twice as Atleti eliminated Los Blancos 4-2 (agg) in the previous round of the cup competition.

After winning the La Liga title last season and with their Champions League campaign on track, Torres believes Atletico can consistently challenge Spain's traditional big two clubs.

'Thank God there's a third team in the form of Atletico, who have been able to beat them and who can stand up to them in every competition these days. We are a difficult team to beat,' he told TVE. 

The Catalans defeated Atletico Madrid 3-1 in the league earlier this month and Torres accepts Luis Enrique's side are difficult to beat if they are allowed to control the game.

'When they are feeling good, when they feel comfortable and they are in their element, then they win their games, as they did against Deportivo,' he said.

Interest in Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone is unlikely to die down if his success continues

The success of Madrid's second club under coach Diego Simeone has led to interest in the Argentinian coach from several high profile European clubs, with Torres conceding that is unlikely to cease.  

'He'll have offers. I'm sure he has had, he has, and he will have offers, whatever players he has and whatever shape the team is in.'

Simeone himself claims he is happy at the Vicente Calderon, saying he would not leave for 'a great offer from Madrid or even Brazil'.
