Angry: Zyad Younan, 41, says he was drugged and scammed out of $135,000 by strippers

A cardiologist who is being sued for $135,000 in unpaid bills by a New York strip club has detailed how he was allegedly lured into a stripper crime ring, drugged and then robbed of the sum.

Zyad Younan, 41, has accused Karina Pascucci, 26, Samantha Barbash, 40, and Marsi Rosen, 28, of slipping a substance into his drink before racking up the huge debts while he was unconscious or not in control of his actions.

The three women worked for Scores, a strip club that is now suing Younan for the bill after he told American Express he had been swindled and they reversed the charges.

But Younan has finally given his side of the story in papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court and has blamed the club as well as the women, the New York Daily News reported.

'Scores along with (the dancers) engaged in a conspiracy and scheme to steal money from Younan by drugging him, taking possession of his credit card without his knowledge or permission, and charging unauthorized and exorbitant amounts to that credit card,' the court papers say.

Younan, who is single, explained that he first became involved with the women when he went out to dinner with at a Manhattan restaurant and was approached by Pascucci, who claimed she was a nursing student.

They swapped numbers and she later asked him out to dinner. They enjoyed several dinners together, as well as a concert, and on some occasions, she brought Rosen and Barbash with her, falsely claiming they were her relatives.

'Scam': He said he was approached by Karina Pascucci, left, while out having dinner and they went out several times. She introduced him to 2 friends she claimed were relatives, including Marsi Rosen, right

During those evenings out, the women slipped a drug into his drink that 'caused him to enter a semi-conscious state, lose the ability to act voluntarily and make knowing decisions, as well as lose his memory,' the suit claims.

He said he was shocked when he got an American Express bill for $135,303.14 in charges to a strip club - which he didn't even remember going to.

He reported the charges as fraudulent and American Express reversed the charges - which left Scores and the three women irritated, he said.

'Karina desperately attempted to persuade Younan to pay the amounts allegedly due to Scores by claiming the charges were not fraudulent and that Scores had videotape of Younan at the club,' the papers claim.

'Ringleader': She also introduced him to Samantha Barbash, pictured, and as he partied with the three women, they drugged him and then used his credit card to rack up massive debts at a strip club, he said

The women harrassed him with phone calls and text messages, he claimed, forcing him to tell Pascucci to make them stop, adding: 'I don’t need to speak with swindlers.'

But they didn't stop, and Scores staff also began contacting him, he said.

The club then filed suit against him and argued that it had Younan on video four times over a 10-day period in November handing out big tips and going to a private room with five women.

Their lawsuit alleges Younan 'voluntarily came to plaintiff’s place of business and requested that plaintiff provide him with food, beverages and services'.

Costs at the club can certainly soar; it costs you $20 to get through the door and bottles of champagne can sometimes cost more than $1,000. A meal at the club can cost $250, and guests are allowed to leave tips for the dancers on their credit cards, the Daily News previously reported.

Scene: The women allegedly took the doctor - and their other victims - to Scores, where they were scammed out of thousands on their credit cards. The club has denied they are to blame for the spending

Younan, a cardiologist at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Jersey, is seeking unspecified money damages for battery, theft, conspiracy and defamation.

Pascucci, Barbash and Rosen were arrested last month with two others for allegedly drugging and scamming wealthy men and scamming them out of almost $200,000.

After their arrests, they were accused of prowling bars in Manhattan and Long Island for their victims over a four month period beginning in September 2013.

A banker, a lawyer and a real estate attorney were also among their alleged victims.

No criminal charges have been filed against Scores but the investigation is ongoing. The club did not return MailOnline's call for comment.

Zyad Younan 'was approached by Karina Pascucci, 26, in a bar and asked him out on a date so she could scam him with two others strippers'

Pascucci, Samantha Barbash and Marsi Rosen 'slipped a drug into his drink before taking him to a club where they charged him $135,000'

He said he only became aware of his 'spending' when he got an AmEx bill and he got the charges reversed

The women and two others have been arrested in the 'scam' but the club, which has sued Younan, claims he readily spent the money on strippers
