It may seem the perfect Halloween prank, but astronomers say they have spotted a mysterious 'eye' on Saturn.

The giant eye appears to be looking directly at the Hubble space telescope, which captured the image.

However, Nasa says that in fact the image shows a shadow over a storm. 

Lokking right back at you: On April 21, 2014, when Hubble was being used to monitor changes in Jupiter's immense Great Red Spot (GRS) storm, a shadow caused this 'eye' to appear.

During the exposures, the shadow of the Jovian moon Ganymede swept across the center of the GRS.This gave the giant planet the uncanny appearance of having a pupil in the center of a 10,000-mile-diameter 'eye.'

 A bizarre six-sided storm churning Saturn’s north pole has flummoxed astronomers ever since it was first spotted thirty years ago.

Now, astronomers believe they may have solved one of its biggest mysteries by working out how it operates - and discovering the rotation period of Saturn in the process.

The giant storm operates rather like the jet stream on Earth they say - explaining why it never appears to move.

It is one of many unusual storms on Saturn.

The unusual structure with a hexagonal shape surrounding Saturn's north pole was spotted on the planet for the first time thirty years ago.

This bizarre six-sided storm churning Saturn’s north pole has flummoxed astronomers ever since it was first spotted thirty years ago.

The hexagon is a wavy jet stream of 200 mph winds and spans 20,000 miles (30,000 kilometers) across - more than twice the diameter of Earth.

Nothing similar with such a regular geometry had ever been seen on any planet in the Solar System.

The Planetary Sciences Group has now been able to study and measure the phenomenon and, establish its rotation period, and that of Saturn - the only planet in the Solar System whose rotation time remains unknown.

Researchers found seasonal variations do not affect the hexagon and its jet stream at all, so concluded both are part of an extensive wave, deeply rooted in Saturn's atmosphere.

The latest images gave the giant planet the uncanny appearance of having a pupil in the center of a 10,000-mile-diameter 'eye.' 'For a moment, Jupiter 'stared' back at Hubble like a one-eyed giant Cyclops,' Nasa said.

The UPV/EHU researchers suggest that the hexagon and its stream are the manifestation of a 'Rossby wave' similar to those that form in the mid-latitudes of the earth.

On our planet the jet stream meanders from west to east and brings, associated with it, the system of areas of low pressure and anticyclones which we have been seeing regularly on weather maps.

On Saturn, a hydrogen gas planet, ten times the size of the Earth, cold in its upper clouds, without a solid surface, and with an atmosphere as deep as that of an ocean, 'the hexagonal wavy motion of the jet stream is expected to be propagated vertically and reveal to us aspects of the planet’s hidden atmosphere,' said Agustín Sánchez-Lavega, Head of the Planetary Sciences research group.
