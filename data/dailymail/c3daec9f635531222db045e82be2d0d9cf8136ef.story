A California zoo has begun holding regular iPad gaming sessions - for its penguins. 

Staff at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach say its animals love to play a game originally designed for cats.

However, instead of using paws, they peck at the screen to try and catch a stray mouse that runs around in the game.

Magellanic Penguins were named after the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, who was the first to sail from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean in the mid-1500s through what is now called the Strait of Magellan.

They build their nests during the breeding season along the rocky, sandy beaches of the southern coasts of Argentina and Chile and on the Falkland Islands.

A temperate species, Magellanic Penguins are usually about two to two-and-a-half feet tall and weigh between six and fifteen pounds when fully grown. 

Sara Mandel at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach said she originally tried out the game at home.

'It's a game called 'Game for Cats' - but we found the penguins like to hang out with it.

'I'd originally bought it for my cats, but I put in down in their enclosure and two of the penguins just started pecking at it.'

The team were astonished when the birds instantly took to the game, chasing an on-screen mouse and managing to score highly on the game by tapping their beaks on the screen.

Two Magellanic penguins, Jeremy and Newson, began the game, but Mandel says many of the animals now regularly play.

'The animals all started playing with it. 

'We even find they get so engrossed we can examine them.'

However, she is hopeful that an ever better game could come along for the animals. 

'We know they like this game, and we know they like shiny objects - so we are hoping someone will put the two together.'

Zoo volunteer Hugo Ryono first experiments with the game at the zoo in 2013.

He had the idea after a discussion with keepers about the iPad app 'Game for Cats' and wondering if it could be used as an enrichment aid for the penguins.

Sara Mandel at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach said she originally tried out the game at home.

'Just like cats penguins are very 
curious and the idea of these birds following a virtual mouse on a 
screen was just too appealing to me not to try out. 

'Dusting off my old iPad 1 and loading Game for Cats app on it we set up a penguin video arcade in the exhibit last week.'

'Sure enough when Jeremy and Newsom 
noticed the iPad in the exhibit they both waddled on over. Jeremy was 
the first to try it out but Newsom was the one that really got into it. 

'Stalking the virtual mouse intently he tried to pick it up repeatedly with his beak.

'Newsom especially seemed to like the squeak that the mouse made when he put his beak on the virtual critter.

'The mouse was self reinforcing for this penguin.

'Newsom set the penguin high score of 1600 for the game.'
