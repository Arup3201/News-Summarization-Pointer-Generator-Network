Ronald Koeman will ask Southampton's board for January transfer reinforcements to boost his side's chances of staying the Premier League's top-four course.

Boss Koeman has admitted Saints have 'a long way to go' to learn how to handle life at the Premier League's sharp end.

The former Holland defender will target seasoned campaigners who know how to secure Champions League football if handed a sizeable January transfer kitty.

Koeman is determined to bolster Southampton's strength and depth, admitting the St Mary's club lag behind traditional Premier League powers in squad size.

'I will speak to the board of the club, about what we need and what we would like to do,' said Koeman.

'This is the hardest league (in the world) because you can lose against everybody.

'You have to be prepared every game and you can't play on 70 per cent.

'You have to be 100 per cent and that's difficult for us, because we need everybody.

'Everybody needs to be fit and we don't have the numbers and players that the big teams have, and that's difficult.'

The early season's great success story, Saints face a daunting December run of seven games in 25 days, Wednesday's trip to Arsenal preceding clashes with Manchester United, Everton and Chelsea.

Saints surrendered second spot to Manchester City on Sunday, with Yaya Toure, Frank Lampard and Gael Clichy completing a routine 3-0 win for Manuel Pellegrini's men.

Manager Mauricio Pochettino's summer departure to Spurs sparked a player drain of top talent that had all and sundry tipping Saints to struggle for survival.

Instead new boss Koeman has recruited wisely, shaken off those pre-season fears and guided Saints to even greater heights.

Now the former Barcelona star has called on Saints to cast aside disappointment after Sunday's loss to City, to adapt quickly to life at the Premier League's sharp end.

'We can talk about how to handle it all, we can show them clips from games for example, but finally that is for the player by himself to change and to learn off that, and we speak about that,' said Koeman.

'The club doesn't have the experience of other teams.

'The players don't have that experience that the players of the big teams have, that's the difference.

'We'd like to be that: the club likes to be where we are and everybody wants to keep that position.

'That's difficult, because we have different players.

'We have younger players and we don't have that experience.

'That's always important to stay at the top, that's what we are working towards, but it's a long way to go.

'In the summer the first question was 'what about relegation', then two months later it was 'how about the Champions League'.

'Now people ask 'will you slip down', and that's understandable, that's football life.

'It means a lot to the start of our season, how other teams are looking at us.

'They realise it's difficult to beat Southampton.

'We will not be nervous after Sunday's result, or nervous to be high in the table: situations are always changing so fast in football.

'We have a fantastic spirit though, and we have very good, professional players.

'They know exactly what they must do to be good professionals, but we have to learn, we have to learn from the mistakes.'
