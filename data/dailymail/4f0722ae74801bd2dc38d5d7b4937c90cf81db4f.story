Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge has defended team-mate Mario Balotelli, claiming that the Italian is misunderstood.

Sturridge has been left watching from the sidelines in recent months due to injury, with the 25-year-old last appearing for the Reds on August 31.

And as Balotelli faces criticism for his poor form since arriving at Anfield - although he responded by scoring against Swansea City in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday night - Sturridge has jumped to his defence.

Sturridge told Mirror Online: 'Mario is really cool and I get along with him - I enjoy working with him.

'But everyone says similar things about him like he is wild and then he ends up getting stereotyped.

'He is under the microscope and he is at that level where he is known around the world and he does get scrutinised.

'I think the average 24-year-old or guys who go to university who are a little younger will have done a lot crazier things than him.

'Everyone makes mistakes and has flaws - he is just finding his way.'
