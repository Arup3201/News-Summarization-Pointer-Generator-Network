A cycling fanatic has recreated some of the most memorable artworks and pop culture images - using scrap bike parts.

Jenny Beatty, 31, has fashioned familiar works including Andy Warhol Campbell's Soup can, a poster of Breaking Bad's Walter White and even the famous Nirvana Nevermind album cover.

Other works include a Star Wars Stormtrooper, Spongebob Squarepants, and film posters of Silence of the Lambs and Clockwork Orange.

There are even some retro designs such as TV puppet character Alf, the 1982 Tron film and the Pac Man video game.

The New York-based artist's 100 Hoopties project is a design challenge project where every day for one hundred days - from 7 April to 15 July - an iconic poster design will be reanimated through scrapped bicycle parts.

Jenny has used recycled bicycle parts including chains, reflectors, handlebar plugs, pulley cages, springs, and brake bolts and pads.

Posters from two of the scariest films ever, A Clockwork Orange from 1971 (left) and The Silence of the Lambs from 1991 feature in this unique 100-day artistic project in New York

Alf (left) was considered one of the funniest characters on TV when his sitcom ran from 1986 to 1990, while Breaking Bad's Walter White (right) is one of the most popular

Nirvana's Nevermind album cover from 1991 was conceived by the band's late singer Kurt Cobain

The "I Want to Believe' poster from 1992 appeared on Fox Mulder's office in the sci-fi series, The X Files, while 'SpongeBob SquarePants has been loved by children since 1999

Tron (left), was not popular on release in 1982, and only developed a cult following later. But Steven Speilberg's shark thriller Jaws (right) became one of the highest grossing films of all time when it was released in 1975Â 

Pac Man was one of the first mass market video games and it took the planet by storm when it was released in 1980. The dot-munching creation is now one of the 100 art works by Jenny Beatty using bike parts

Andy Warhol's Campbells Soup can (left, 1962) and the Obey Giant icon (right, 1992) are two of the most famous pieces of modern art. While they were created 30 years apart, they have both been copied and reproduced across the world
