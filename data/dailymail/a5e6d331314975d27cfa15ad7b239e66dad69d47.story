Two experienced American climbers died while scaling Argentina’s tallest mountain, it was revealed today.

Friends David Reinhart and Eric Nourse, joined by Eric’s twin brother Greg, were around 22,000 feet on Mount Aconcagua when Reinhart began experiencing severe symptoms of altitude sickness. 

Both Reinhart, 42, and Eric Nourse, 41, who had gone to seek help, perished on the steep slopes of the mountain. Greg Nourse alone survived.

Loss: David Reinhart, a 42-year-old real estate executive from Portland, Oregon, began suffering symptoms of altitude sickness; Eric Nourse went to find help first, and was later followed by his brother Greg

According to Spanish-language news reports, the three alpinists were planning on scaling the summit of Aconcagua, which stands at 22,841 feet above sea level.

The route they chose ran along a glacier, and is considered to be one of the most dangerous passages to the summit, Argentinian news outlets reported.

As they were ascending last Friday, Reinhart developed altitude sickness that required immediate medical attention. The team used a satellite radio to call for help on Saturday.

There are conflicting reports as to who remained with Reinhart and who first went to seek help. Matt Felton, who worked with Reinhart at a commercial real-estate company in Portland, Oregon, told the Oregonian that it was Eric who went to find help.

Felton said: ‘(Reinhart)was doing something he really loved. He was doing it with his best friend.’His brother Greg remained with Reinhart to keep him warm on the frigid glacier. Greg then left to go find help.

An Argentinian rescue squad found Eric Nourse in critical condition. He later died from pulmonary edema, where fluid fills the lungs, despite workers administering CPR to him.

The condition is a common result of serious altitude sickness.

According to the Oregonian, the Reinhart family later chartered a private plane to find Reinhart’s body. The rescue team found Greg Nourse alive but in need of medical care. He was admitted to a hospital in Mendoza.

An Argentinian spokesperson told Spanish news agency Telam that Reinhart was ‘found dead in the rocky area called second band, at about 6,600 meters above sea level.’ 

Reinhart’s brother, Craig Reinhart, told the Oregonian by phone that his brother and their friends loved to travel the world and often would go on expeditions without guides.

‘They loved the outdoors, they loved each other and their families,’ he said from Argentina.

He flew down to the South American country to arrange for his brother and Eric Nourse’s bodies to be sent back to the U.S.

On their Facebook pages, each of the men is pictured camping, hiking, and going on other outdoor pursuits. They had been on expeditions in the Alps and had once scaled Mt McKinley. 

Reinhart is survived by his wife Char, as well as three brothers. Eric Nourse’s marital status is unclear.

The mountain is located in the western province of Mendoza.
