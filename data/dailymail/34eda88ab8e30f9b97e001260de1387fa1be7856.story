Hull unveiled a new club crest on Friday morning, with the design not incorporating the team name.

The fresh logo features the tiger's head which has been depicted on four of the club's seven previous badges, but does not have the club's name on it.

That is sure to spark debate among supporters who earlier this year successfully lobbied against a name change.

Chairman Assem Allam wanted to rebrand the club from Hull City AFC to Hull Tigers, citing the word city as 'common' and claiming the club would be more marketable on the continent if known as 'Tigers'.

His wish was not granted by the Football Association but the club continues to use the name Hull City Tigers in statements and commercial operations.

Allam had said he would appeal the decision - which came in April - but there has been no official comment since.

Allam's son and vice-chairman, Ehab, said the new crest, which has the club's formation year of 1904 on it, helps celebrate Hull's history as they head into European football for the first time.

'This is a more stripped back and modern approach which still celebrates the club's heritage and history by focusing on our famous and well established Tiger's head,' he said.

'We have also introduced "1904" to the crest to document the year our club was formed.

'Our first ever step into European competition is a new era for us all and we are all excited about the season ahead.'
