A South Florida man left a note for his family saying he was going to relax in the sauna on Sunday but when he failed to return hours later his daughter made the horrifying discovery that he had cooked to death.

Lara Antiporek and her mother Ronnie Antiporek believe that a faulty timer on the sauna at Eden Isles Condominiums led to Dennis Antiporek's untimely death and they plan to sue the housing complex.

Lara was the unfortunate loved one who found her father's blackened remains inside of the sauna. She tearfully recalled not recognizing the 'black' man inside but when she saw her dad's clothing hanging on the hook she soon realized her father's skin was dark because he had been cooked to death.

'When I opened the door, I looked and there was a black man in the sauna. It wasn’t my dad so I shut the door and I looked, the clothes hanging, it was his clothes,' Lara Antiporek told CBS. 

'While I called 911, I was opening the door so I could breathe,' Laura Antiporek told Local 10.

Ronnie recalls seeing her husband of nearly 50 years' skin smeared on the floor and the bench of the sauna.

Ronnie says she can't shake the blood curdling images of her husband's corpse from her mind no matter how hard she tries.

'I close my eyes and I just see his face charred,' said Ronnie Antiporek in shock.

Dennis and Ronnie's love first ignited in high school. Dennis would have been 69 soon and he also would have celebrated his 50th wedding anniversary.

The family has hired an attorney to file a wrongful death lawsuit against the condominium for what they believe is not checking the safety of the sauna and for having a faulty timer.

'First and foremost, we want to make sure that this community maintains a level of safety for all residents,' said Attorney Joseph Madalon to CBS.

'We believe at this point in time that he died by asphyxiation by becoming overheated,' family attorney Douglas Ede said to Local 10.
