Braces from Olivier Giroud and Santi Cazorla secured victory for Arsenal as Arsene Wenger's side put their recent Premier League troubles behind them 

The Gunners moved within two points of the Premier League's top four after this 4-1 demolition of Newcastle.  

Sportsmail's Matt Barlow was at the Emirates to run the rule over both sets of teams...

ARSENAL (4-1-4-1)

Wojciech Szczesny 6

Entirely redundant until terrific save to deny Gouffran before the interval and barely tested again before Newcastle’s goal.

Hector Bellerin 7 

Good pace and got forward well. One great first-half diagonal run and set up Giroud’s second. Booked for an innocuous tap on Dummett. 

Mathieu Debuchy 7 

Settled well at centre-half and surprisingly strong in the air against Ameobi. 

Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin (right) showed good pace and got forward often against the Magpies 

Per Mertesacker 6.5 

Hit the bar early on but the captain will have been disappointed his defensive unit leaked a soft-goal from a free-kick. 

Kieran Gibbs 6.5 

Combined well with Welbeck on the left. Defended well and went close with volley slammed into the side-netting. 

Mathieu Flamini 6 

Arsenal wobbled briefly for five minutes either side of half-time but were mostly in control and he wasn’t tested greatly

Gunners forward Alexis Sanchez (right) controls possession as Jack Colback watches on 

Alexis Sanchez 7.5 

The usual powerball performance. Strong and dangerous out wide or through the centre. Delivered the cross for Giroud’s first goal. 

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 7

Terrific energy and changes of pace. This formation gives Arsenal so much in attack but little help for Flamini shielding defence.

Santi Cazorla 7.5

Not everything came off for him on his 30th birthday but scored with a delicious chip from a tight angle and added the fourth with a Panenka penalty. 

Santi Cazorla bagged a brace for the Gunners including a superbly taken late penalty at the Emirates 

Danny Welbeck 7 

Effective and threatened goal, even from wide on left. Had one harshly disallowed and volleyed another just wide.

Olivier Giroud 8 

Majestic header to open scoring and his link-up play was excellent. Also won important headers in his own box.

SUBS ON: Podolski (for Giroud 73), Coquelin (Sanchez 87), Maitland-Niles (Oxlade-Chamberlain 90)

SUBS: Martinez, Ajayi, Campbell, Sanogo.

BOOKINGS: Bellerin, Oxlade-Chamberlain.

MANAGER: Arsene Wenger 7.5.

Newcastle United goalkeeper Jak Alnwick struggled on his first start between the posts 

NEWCASTLE 4-2-3-1

Jak Alnwick 4.5 

A day to forget for the 21-year-old on his first start. Seemed nervous, hesitant and barely protected against Arsenal’s rampaging attackers. Early goal only added to anxieties.

Daryl Janmaat 5 

Overwhelmed at times by the speed and movement of Arsenal’s attacking players and barely able to support in attack.

Fabricio Coloccini 6 

Made some key tackles but his defence simply could not cope with Giroud and the runners around him. Might have conceded more. 6.

Fabricio Coloccini (right) made some key tackles but struggled to cope with the pace of Arsenal's attack 

Mike Williamson 5.5 

Also suffered against a fluent attacking force and did not look comfortable all game.

Paul Dummett 6 

Quick, committed and aggressive, although he struggled to contain Sanchez and conceded a penalty with a foul on Welbeck.

Cheick Tiote 5 

Lucky to avoid an early red for studs-up follow through into Sanchez midriff after five minutes. Booked later for chopping down the Ox. 

Cheick Tiote was fortunate not to be sent off early in the contest after his reckless tackle on Sanchez 

Jack Colback 6.5 

Good passing and dead-ball delivery. His midfield consistency must be one of the few positives to take back to Tyneside. 

Ayoze Perez 5 

Moved around into different positions but made no impact until after the substitutions, when he scored with header from Colback free-kick.

Sammy Ameobi 4.5 

Dominated in air by Debuchy while in centre. Worked hard when on the left but offered little going forward and hooked after less than an hour. 

Newcastle's Sammy Ameobi heads clear under pressure from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 

Yoan Gouffran 5

In for suspended Sissoko. Header forced a good save from Szczesny and a scramble but otherwise rarely involved.

Papiss Cisse 4 

Seven in the Premier League before this but entirely anonymous. Few chances and link-up play poor. 

SUBS ON: Rivieire (for Ameobi 56) Cabella (for Cisse 56), Armstrong (for Perez 82)

SUBS: Woodman, Armstrong, Anita, Haidara, Vuckic,

BOOKINGS: Tiote, Janmeet.

MANAGER: Alan Pardew 5.5.
