Margaret Thatcher's hometown is divided over proposals to name a new bypass after the former prime minister.

The people of Grantham, Lincolnshire, are eagerly awaiting a new relief road and supporters are clamouring for it to be named in her honour.

There is no permanent memorial to of Britain's first female prime minister, who died in 2013, in the town, except for a small plaque commemorating her birthplace.

Proposals to name a bypass in Margaret Thatcher's hometown in her honour has divided the town. Pictured, the former prime minister at the Conservative Party conference in 1989

So Ray Wootten, a Conservative councillor for Lincolnshire county council, was eager to remedy that and registered the names Lady Thatcher Way, Margaret Thatcher Way and Baroness Thatcher Way for the bypass.

He said he proposed the idea in a bid to provide a fitting memorial to the town's most famous export - but he admits the town is divided over the issue. 

Councillor Ray Wootten thinks naming the bypass after Baroness Thatcher would be a fitting tribute

Councillor Wootten added a previous proposal to build a statue in Baroness Thatcher's honour several years ago had sparked the same controversy. 

He told MailOnline: 'It's certainly caused a stir. The town is divided.

'It was the same thing with the statue four or five years ago. 

'I raised the idea of a statue and a tourist trail and the response was "We shouldn't commemorate her life and there are far more important people than Mrs Thatcher". 

'But we need to really celebrate her life and her career. 

'Mrs Thatcher certainly changed the world in which we live in today.

'She really put the great back in Great Britain.'

He added: 'I have received people from Canada, Japan, France and Germany who all wanted to visit Grantham and couldn't understand why there isn't anything to commemorate Mrs Thatcher.

'Some months ago, I made enquiries as to whether anybody had registered names for the bypass - which was no.

'So I stuck my head above the parapet and registered Lady Thatcher Way, Baroness Thatcher Way and Margaret Thatcher Way.' 

But Labour politicians in the town are strongly against the idea, claiming it would be wrong to name the bypass after such a controversial person.  

Councillor Wootten's idea of a Margaret Thatcher tourist trail also sparked controversy. Pictured, her birthplace - a corner shop in North Parade, Grantham
