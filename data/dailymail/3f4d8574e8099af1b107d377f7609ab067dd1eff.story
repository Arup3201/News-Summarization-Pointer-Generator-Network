Allison Peery did not to expect to have such an exciting New Years Eve.

Boarding a Delta Airlines flight from San Francisco to their home of Minneapolis on Wednesday, the pregnant first-time mom was not due for a couple of weeks.

After experiencing back pain while getting on the plane, Peery said she knew immediately what was happening.

And if further confirmation was needed, her waters then broke. 

Dramatic welcome to the world: Karl William Peery was born in Salt Lake City on New Years Eve after his mother went into labor just minutes into a flight

Healthy: Little Karl was not expected for another few weeks, but weighed in at 4 lbs and 6 oz

Shocked: Alison Peery said she 'immediately' knew she was in labor on the Delta flight 

'I could tell right away,' she told Good 4 Utah.

The pregnancy advanced quickly. 

'I was getting contractions about every minute almost immediately, which was scary,' Peery said.#

'Right away they announced that there was a medical emergency and asked if there was any doctors or nurses on board.'

Fortunately there was a pediatrician on the flight, who got straight up to help.

Airline staff cleared an aisle and set up a privacy curtain. 

Praise: Mrs Peery said the Delta staff were excellent at looking after her, along with a doctor on board 

'They were great, like helping me breathe because we hadn't done our classes yet, so we were really kind of out of our element,' Peery said.

But it suddenly became clear the flight was not going to make it to Minneapolis.

The plane had only been in the air for 30 minutes of the four hour flight. 

The pilot made a decision to make an emergency landing in Salt Lake City.

Emergency crews rushed Peery to the University of Utah Hospital, where doctors performed a cesarean section after realizing the baby was breech. 

Elated: Alison Peery and her husband were not expecting such a dramatic birth for their first child 

Karl William Peery was born healthy despite the early delivery.

He weighed in at 4 lbs and 6 oz.

His mother said she learnt a very valuable lesson though when expecting her second child.

'I'm going to not fly during my next pregnancy, or leave my state,' she said.
