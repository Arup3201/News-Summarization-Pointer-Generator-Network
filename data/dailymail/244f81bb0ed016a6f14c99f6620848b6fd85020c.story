A man from Florida hated his job so much that he staged a fake break-in at his house and called police so he would have an excuse to stay at home. 

Dwayne Yeager, 31, of Brandon, Florida, called police at 7.25am on Monday to report that a burglar had broken into his house.

The father is believed to work in a fabrication job at Dooson Hydro Technology.

According to a police report, Yeager said the windows in his son's bedroom were open and that he saw a white Honda Civic pull away when he arrived.

Worse than calling in sick: Dwayne Yeager staged a break-in at his house so he didn't have to go to work

In a call to police which was recorded and replayed on Bay News 9 he said: 'My TV's in there on the ground' and described the car as a 'white, kind of little Honda Civic pulling away. White, it had kind of like a black fender.'

However, when police arrived they found no sign of forced entry and surveillance video appears to capture Yeager setting up the break-in. 

Neighbours say they saw Yeager leave, return home and open the windows himself, according to CBS Tampa. 

'Thatâ€™s just absolutely ridiculous,' neighbour Doris Morell told Bay News 9. 'I mean, who would do that? Thatâ€™s just absurd.'

According to police, Yeager eventually admitted he ransacked his own home to make it look like it had been broken into before calling police to avoid going to work.

The report said : 'He stated his wife was adamant that he go to work and he didn't want to.'  

Yeager was held in custody and accused of providing false information. He was later released on $500 bail.
