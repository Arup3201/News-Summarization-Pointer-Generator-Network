The Highland estate made famous by the popular TV series Monarch of the Glen has gone on the market for the first time in 200 years for £7million.

Balavil House was known as Kilwillie Castle and its 7,000 acres near Kinguissie, Inverness, as the fictional estate of Glenbogle by fans of the BBC programme, starring the late Richard Briers.

The estate, which allows visitors to stalk red deer, shoot grouse and pheasant and even catch salmon, has been owned by Allan Macpherson-Fletcher's family since 1790.

Monarch of the Glen, first aired in 2000 and followed Archie MacDonald, a young restaurateur is called back to his childhood home of Glenbogle where he is told he is the new Laird of Glenbogle

But now he wants to retire and pass the land onto a younger shooting enthusiast.

He said: 'Balavil has provided great fun for family, friends and clients over the years but, after running the estate for 40 years, the time has come to retire.

'We hope that someone with vision will take the estate forward into the next chapter of its rich history.'

Andrew Rettie, of selling agents Strutt and Parker, said: 'A jewel in the crown of Scottish sporting estates, Balavil encompasses the very best the Highlands can offer, from spectacular sport to a house made for entertaining.

'In addition, the welcome and hospitality offered by the Macpherson-Fletchers in running the house as a business is second to none and known throughout the UK and further afield.

'They have made Balavil House a centrepiece of the estate. Buyers will not necessarily choose to continue with the business but they have the potential to do so if they so wish.

'Visiting Balavil is a unique experience and, of course, it offers the opportunity to achieve a Macnab, a hallowed challenge sought after by many a sportsman.'

The 6,846-acre estate is made up of 600 acres of forestry, flowing landscaped parkland, eight houses and cottages, a hill farm with a cow herd and a flock of sheep.

In 1790, it was bought by Allan's great, great, great, great uncle, James 'Ossian' Macpherson - who was known for translating ancient Gaelic manuscripts from the third century bard, Ossian.

Ossian was considered the most important literary figure in Europe and Napoleon never travelled without his copy of The Poems of Ossian.

James commissioned Robert Adam to build Balavil House, incorporating the walls of the original castle.

The name Balavil derives from the French belle ville, beautiful town, which Macpherson adopted as the name of the estate in 1790.

But in recent years, the house has become a regular appearance on television programmes.

It featured as Kilwillie Castle in the Monarch of the Glen and it was also the location for an episode of the Kill it, Cook it, Eat with presenter Julia Bradbury.

It also once played host to chefs Sophie Grigson and the Two Hairy Bikers.
