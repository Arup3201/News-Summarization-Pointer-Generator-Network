Decline: Frozen burger sales have dropped by 43 per cent since evidence of horse meat contamination first emerged

Supermarket shoppers are abandoning the frozen food aisles as sales of burgers and ready meals plummet in the wake of the horse meat scandal.

Frozen burger sales are down by 43 per cent  and frozen ready meals by 13 per cent since traces of horse DNA were first found in products on sale in Britain on January 16.

Despite the evidence of customers turning their backs on frozen food, surveys have revealed significant numbers of consumers would be happy to eat horse meat - provided it was labelled correctly.

Two polls found large numbers of Britons would eat horse meat as long as it was 'safe' and properly labelled.

The evidence of British meat eaters' willingness to try horse emerged after it was discovered in a huge consignment of meatballs being served up in Ikea restaurants last week.

French owned catering firm Sodexo withdrew the suspect products from outlets in the UK and 12 other countries on Friday - without telling consumers why.

Details of the contaminated frozen beef products only emerged following the publication of test results by food watchdogs in the Czech Republic.

Last week also saw supermarket giant Tesco make the shocking admission that the 'minced beef' in its Everyday Value range frozen bolognese contained up to 100 per cent horse meat.

The ready meals were produced by Comigel, a French firm also linked to contaminated products at Findus and Aldi.

New figures for 
the 12 weeks to February 17 indicate how consumers have responded to the
scandal, and suggests shoppers are changing the products they buy 
rather than the supermarkets they buy them from.

Edward 
Garner, director of Kantar Worldpanel, which compiled the figures, said: 'The issue has so far only affected the performance of 
individual markets rather than where consumers are choosing to shop.

'For the four weeks ending February 
17, frozen burger sales were down by 43 per cent and frozen ready meals 
declined by 13 per cent, clearly demonstrating a change in shopping 
habits.

'Tesco's share has come under 
pressure this period with a drop from 30.1 per cent a year ago to 29.7 
per cent now,' said Mr Garner.

He added that the decline should not 
be attributed entirely to horse meat contamination, as the supermarket 
giant introduced heavy promotions this time in 2012 which have not been 
repeated for 2013.

Nestle - the world’s biggest food comapny - announces it is removing beef ready meals from sale in Italy and Spain after its own tests found more than one per cent horsemeat DNA in its beef ravioli and tortellini.

Birds Eye removes three beef ready meals from sale in the UK and Ireland after one of its products being sold in Belgium tested positive for horse DNA

Pub giant Whitbread - which owns Beefeater, Brewers Fayre, Table Table, Taybarns and Premier Inn - confirms it has found horsemeat in its products.

Tesco reveals its Everyday value spaghetti bolognese contained up to 100 per cent horsemeat.

Revealed that packs of Findus frozen lasagne meals being sold around the UK contained up to 100 per cent horse meat. The lasagne packs were manufactured by French company, Comigel, at a plant in Metz, which produces food for supermarkets in Britain and Europe.

Comigel makes a range of beef products for Tesco and Aldi. Both stores begin removing those products as a ‘precautionary measure’.

Asda removes four own-label brands of frozen burgers from sale following the discovery of beef contaminated with horse meat at a manufacturer in Northern Ireland.

Burger King admits to selling burgers contaminated with horsemeat,

Emerges that Asda and Co-op have also been selling burgers contaminated with horsemeat.

Hotel chain Premier Inn removes beef burgers supplied by the company from its restaurants.

It has also revealed schools and hospitals have been serving beef contaminated with horsemeat.

Last week it emerged horse meat had been detected in meatballs on sale in Ikea's in-house restaurants.

'Not repeating this offer will have adversely affected its share,' he said.

He added: 'Waitrose and Aldi deliver all-time record shares this period of 4.8 per cent and 3.3 per cent respectively,' he said.

Mr Garner added that 10.1 per cent 
growth at Iceland indicated the frozen food category as a whole 'remains
robust' despite the impact on burger and ready meal sales.

A survey of almost 14,000 meat eaters found 51 per cent would buy horse meat as long as they knew it was bred for eating and was therefore safe.

Of those who said they would eat horse meat, 29 per cent said it would need to be cheaper than beef.

However, 48 per cent said they would refuse horse meat outright, even it if was free, according to the survey conducted by MoneySavingExpert.com.

Founder Martin Lewis said: 'With a majority of meat-eaters saying they would consider buying horse meat, the mislabelling scandal may have opened the door for providers of horse meat into the UK.

'Many who have, albeit unwittingly, already eaten it, now say if it were properly labelled they'd give it a go.'

A separate survey by Ipsos Mori found consumers aged 45 to 54 are the most likely to be willing horse meat consumers (38 per cent), while those aged 16 to 24 are the least likely (21 per cent).

It revealed 33 per cent of Britons expect to buy fewer ready meals in future and 18 per cent will choose fewer Findus products in particular, with 43 per cent saying they considered the company's response to the crisis to be 'poor'.

However they are slightly less critical of other food brands affected by the scandal, with 35 per cent rating Tesco's response as poor and 34 per cent disapproving of Aldi's reaction, while 12 per cent said they planned to reduce their spending at Tesco.

The majority (59 per cent) said the Government should do more to regulate food safety.Ipsos Mori spokesman Stephen Yap said: 'Our findings clearly show that the news of horse meat entering the food supply is having a profound impact on British consumers and has eroded trust in food suppliers.

'Findus in particular is bearing the brunt of public anger, with widespread calls for greater government intervention.

'As the scandal deepens and new instances of horse meat contamination are uncovered on an almost daily basis, regulators and the food industry must work quickly and take decisive steps to restore consumer confidence that could be damaged for a long time to come.'

The Co-Operative said today that none of its own brand minced beef products tested for horsemeat contamination were affected.

Peter Marks, the Group Chief Executive, said in a message to company members: 'In
total, 101 of our products were tested for contamination as part of a 
mass testing exercise called for by the Food Standards Agency.

'None
of these products which cover the totality of our current minced beef 
food range, have been found to contain any trace of horse DNA.

'Previously,
you may recall, we did discover two lines of our frozen beef burgers 
that did contain horse meat and we immediately removed these from our 
shelves.

Mr Marks said 
the firm was 'pleased' with the results but added: 'We are far from 
complacent about a matter which has clearly shaken customer confidence 
in the food you eat.

'Our independent testing will continue on a rolling basis to ensure ongoing scrutiny,' he said.

The Co-Operative will review its meat supply chain and introduce 'greater transparency' in the process, said Mr Marks.

'Let
me repeat the sincere apology I made to our customers and members last 
week and assure you that we will do all we can to reinforce the 
integrity of our products and the trust that we have spent generations 
building up,' he added.
