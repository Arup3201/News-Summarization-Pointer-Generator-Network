Soft-top cars are most likely to be bought by women in their 50s, figures reveal.

Nearly 7 per cent of females in that age group drive convertibles, say the insurers Diamond.

While there are three times as many men buying soft-tops as there were 15 years ago, the number of women owners has quadrupled.

Motor industry analysts say the boom is being driven by older women freed from the constraints of family car ownership.

Convertibles account for around 4 per cent – 1.3million – of the cars on Britain’s roads and the most likely owner is a female investment manager aged 51 to 60 driving a Mercedes costing more than £33,000.

AA president Edmund King said: ‘Many women who have put family behind them can at last afford the car they want, rather than the car they need.’

Male buyers are also most likely in their 50s, according to figures based on 3.5million insurance policies. For both sexes, the next most common age group for owners is 41 to 50. Convertible ownership seems to follow income and family commitments.

Younger women may not be able to afford one, while for young mothers they are less practical than a sports utility vehicle or family estate.

The Mini Cooper is the second most popular car for women

So women below the age of 20 are least likely to have one at just 1.31 per cent. This increases to 2.76 per cent in their early-20s, 3.35 per cent in the mid-20s and 3.24 per cent in the late-20s. It then dips slightly to 3.01 per cent in the early-30s before rising again to 3.43 per cent in the late-30s and surging once the milestone of 40 is reached.

Women are taken with more affordable models like Mini One and Mini Cooper convertibles, the Peugeot 206 and 307 CC coupe cabriolets, Volkswagen Beetle and Ford Streetka.

And aside from investment managers, the top jobs of roadster ladies include company director, management consultant, merchant banker and marketing chief. Female lawyers, business consultants and sales managers are also addicted to getting the roof down.

The AA said demand for new convertibles halved after the recession and a succession of wet summers before a resurgence in interest last year. They now account for around 4 per cent  of cars on Britain’s roads – 1.3 million in total.

Mr King said: ‘People might imagine that convertible cars would have greatest appeal among younger drivers. But the realities of family life and affordability are most likely to dictate a choice of car that reflects their circumstances.’
