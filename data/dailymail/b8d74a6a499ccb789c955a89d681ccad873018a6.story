She's the fourth-generation Australian jewellery designer whose exquisite designs are red carpet favourites for celebrities.

Now Margot McKinney can add Dita Von Teese to the list of stars wearing her designs, after the burlesque performer donned Ms McKinney's Diamond, Sapphire and Aquamarine Bow Earrings with 12.62ct Laguna Blue Sapphire this week.

Von Teese wore the one-of-a-kind earrings to the Genlux Issue Release Event at Luxe Hotel in Beverly Hills on Wednesday night.

'Dita has such marvellous style and is truly a unique fashion icon. She wears my pieces with aplomb,' said Ms McKinney said.

'It's fabulous to see international celebrities choosing to wear Australian designs and showcase them to the world.

'We really do have some of the most stunning natural stones and gems and I'm delighted that she has chosen to wear them on the red carpet.'

Her designs have previously been worn by other celebrities including Paula Abdul, Idina Menzel, Rebecca Gibney and Anna McGahan.

Rebecca Gibney wore untreated Sapphires 5.06ct and 5.04ct with 39.18ct brilliant and rose cut Diamonds

Paula Abdul wore Kunzite 61.24ct Earrings with Pink Sapphire and Cognac and Diamond Tops

Anna McGahan wore Green Berryl 85.11ct Pendant Earrings with Sapphires, Tsavorite Garnets and Diamonds with a 9.37ct pair of Kunzite

Ms McKinney has enjoyed success in the US, signing with leading luxury department store Neiman Marcus in 2008 where she sells her unique pieces.

Many of her designs feature precious stones from Australia.

'When I'm in these wonderful stores, I talk a lot about Australia and about the wealth of gems that we have - pearls, opals, sapphires and pink diamonds,' she said.

Ms McKinney is a fourth generation McKinney, a well-established family of fine jewellers from Queensland who last year celebrated 130 of family business.

The business was started in 1884 in Toowoomba by her great-great-grandfather John McKinney, who opened a luxury store with wife Sarah after arriving from Ireland.
