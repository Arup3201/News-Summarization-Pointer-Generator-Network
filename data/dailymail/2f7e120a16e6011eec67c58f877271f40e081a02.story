Star Wars fans' expectations went sky-high after a photograph of the Millennium Falcon and an X-wing fighter was taken from the air and published online.

The picture, showing the spacecraft on set at Greenham Common near Newbury in Berkshire, was taken from a flight school plane flying over the area.

It was published on Twitter by Airbourne Aviation Ltd who said: 'Come and book a trail flight with us and fly over the StarWarsEpisodeVII set. Your never know what you might see.!![sic]'

The former airfield was famous in the 1980s for the women's peace camp that sprang up around it in protest at the stationing of nuclear weapons on the site.

One fan, Tom Bexx said: 'Newbury has become cool THE millennium falcon is here', with another, JasonJ, writing: 'It's not easy to try & hide the Millennium Falcon! Beautiful set'.

Star Wars: Episode VII, which is due to be released in cinemas in December 2015, reunites many of the cast of the original films including Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher.

The movie's filming schedule was thrown into chaos in June when Ford, who plays Han Solo, suffered a broken leg after the hydraulic door of the Millennium Falcon fell on him at Pinewood. He has since recovered.

The new film will be set 40 years after the original films in the same fantasy galaxy, and fans have been buzzing with anticipation about what will happen in the latest instalment of the hugely successful space series.

Mark Hamill, who plays Luke Skywalker, said the old guard were there to support the new members of the cast recruited by director JJ Abrams. 

He said: 'It was certainly unexpected. I already had a beginning, middle and end. I never thought we'd come back. To go on to those sets that evoked so many memories, it is just astonishing.

'It just seems like an unexpected gift.'

The cast and crew have also filmed scenes at the remote Irish island of Skellig Michael, the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, and at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire.
