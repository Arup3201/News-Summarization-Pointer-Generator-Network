She is known for her unflappable and mild-mannered on-screen persona.

Until, that is, presenter Holly Willoughby came face-to-face with former Apprentice star Katie Hopkins.

The two blondes became embroiled in a heated debate after Hopkins, 38, claimed it was acceptable to judge children based on their names.

Hopkins criticised names like Tyler, Charmaine and Chardonnay, Holly replied: 'That's terrible, listen to what you're saying'

Katie: There's a whole set of things that go with those sorts of children and that's why I don't like them

Asked about popular baby names on ITV’s 
This Morning show on Wednesday, Miss Hopkins began to criticise ‘lower 
class’ children with names like Chantelle, Charmaine, Chardonnay and 
Tyler.

‘I think you can tell a great deal 
from a name,’ said mother-of-three Miss Hopkins, 38. ‘For me, there’s 
certain names that I hear and I think “urgh”. 

‘For me, a name is a shortcut of 
finding out what class a child comes from and makes me ask: “Do I want 
my children to play with them?”

‘When I hear screeched across the 
playground: “Tyler! Come back ‘ere.” It’s the Tylers, the Charmains the 
Chantelles, the Chardonnays.’

Cult feminist and funnywoman Caitlin Moran slammed Katie's judgemental views

Marie Claire and Michael Vine were unimpressed - as were the vast majority of Twitter users on the subject

She added: ‘There’s a whole set of 
things that go with children like that, who are quite a disruptive 
influence in school and that’s why I don’t like those kind of children.

‘I tend to think that children who 
have intelligent names tend to have fairly intelligent parents and they 
make much better playdates for my children.

‘We are really time short in this world and we need shortcuts to make decisions. It’s very effective.’

Miss Willoughby, 32, was 
flabbergasted, responding: ‘Listen to what you are saying. You judge 
children on names. That’s extraordinary.’

Co-host Phillip Schofield was then 
forced to intervene, asking the women to speak one at a time as the 
argument threatened to boil over.

'I can't believe that you're such an insufferable snob' said Anna May Mangan, who was judged as a child

Phillip Schofield threw his head back in bewilderment as Holly said 'Oh stop, stop right there'

The audience seemed to agree with Anna May (and Holly) saying people shouldn't be judged by their name

But the exchange of words only ended after an increasingly irate Miss Willoughby snapped: ‘Oh stop. Stop right there.’

Viewers took to Twitter in the 
aftermath of the interview to criticise Miss Hopkins, with one writing: 
‘I wouldn’t want my children associating with a woman like her. Call me 
stuck up!’

Another added: ‘Katie Hopkins is an appalling woman, how can she be so judgmental?’

And the nine-minute debate has now 
become an internet sensation, with 3.5million people viewing the clip on
 YouTube in only two days.
