Bryan Kryscio who is accused of stealing an ambulance from a hospital and then telling police he took it to drive to a strip club 

A man who is accused of stealing an ambulance from a hospital in Michigan told police when he was arrested that he took the vehicle so he could drive to a strip club.

Bryan Kryscio was arrested on Sunday after he was found behind the wheel of the emergency vehicle when police pulled him over.

But when they asked him why he took the ambulance he told them he was on his way to a pole dancing club.

Earlier in the evening, officers had been called to McLaren Oakland Hospital in Pontiac, after reports that an ambulance was taken after it was left outside unlocked with the engine running.

According to foxdc.com, emergency workers were returning a stretcher to the ambulance when they saw it being driven off.

One of the ambulance workers had left their cell phone inside and officers were able to use it to trace the vehicle to Sterling Heights, 14 miles away.

Krysico, who is homeless and said to have mental health issues, was then found behind the wheel and immediately arrested.

When officers then asked him why he took the ambulance, he told them he was on his way to the 'Booby Trap', a topless bar in Detroit to see pole dancing, even though the club has been closed for years.

Police confirmed that even though the ambulance had been taken there wasn't any damage and it was returned to the emergency services.

Undersheriff Mike McCabe of Oakland County Police told the Detroit Free Press: 'The caller advised that the ambulance was not locked and that a cellular phone had been left inside.

'The medication box, EMS radio and EKG monitor were all intact.'

Officers had been called to McLaren Oakland Hospital in Pontiac, Michigan, pictured, earlier in the evening after staff reported the theft of an ambulance 

Police also added that he has convictions for robbery in Florida, as well as breaking and entering, trespassing and possession of marijuana convictions in Michigan.

Kryscio, 50, was arraigned yesterday on a charge of unlawfully driving away an automobile and is currently being held at Oakland County Jail.

He is scheduled to appear at Pontiac District Court later this month.
