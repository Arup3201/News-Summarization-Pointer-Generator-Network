Cristiano Ronaldo was treated to a brand new Audi S8 earlier this week, but the Real Madrid forward swapped his flashy sports car for two wheels on Wednesday.

The Ballon d'Or nominee stepped out in a hat and scarf and a pair of sunglasses as he set off on a leisurely bike ride.

The 29-year-old watched from the stands with his son Cristiano Ronaldo Jnr as Real Madrid completed a 9-1 aggregate win against Cornella with a 5-0 rout at the Bernabeu on Tuesday night.

But Ronaldo should  return to action when Real Madrid welcome Celta Vigo to the Spanish capital on Saturday looking to extend their 17-game winning streak.

Ronaldo has scored 28 goals this season is just 22 appearances, a return that has helped Real to the top of the league and earned him another Ballon d'Or nomination.

The Portugal international is battling against Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer to be crowned the world's best player for the second year running.
