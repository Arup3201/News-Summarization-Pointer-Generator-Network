Lawyers will argue Wednesday whether a man accused of pushing his wife off a cliff to her death in Colorado's Rocky Mountain National Park as they celebrated their wedding anniversary should remain in jail.

The federal detention hearing comes after Harold Henthorn, 58, was indicted last week on a charge of first-degree murder in the death of Toni Henthorn, 50.

An autopsy report says she fell or was pushed over the ledge when she paused to take a photo during a hike on Sept. 29, 2012. The couple was visiting the park for their 12th wedding anniversary.

This week, a federal grand jury indicted Harold Henthorn on a charge of first-degree murder more than two years after his wife, Toni, tumbled face first to her death off a ledge in Colorado's Rocky Mountain National Park. Harold is accused of the murder

Only after her death did Toni Henthorn's relatives realize she was covered by three life insurance policies totaling $4.5 million. A claim was sent in for one policy days after she died, court records show.

Harold Henthorn's attorney, Craig L. Truman, has said that the case is complicated and that 'justice will be done' once the facts come to light.

Loss: His first wife, Sandra Lynn, was killed in a freak accident when their car crushed her as she changed a flat tire

Toni Henthorn was an ophthalmologist with her own practice in Jackson, Mississippi, when she met her husband, who told her he was wealthy and persuaded her to move with him to the Denver suburb of Highland Ranch, her brother, Todd Bertolet told The Associated Press.

But once in Colorado, he seemed controlling and obsessed with money, Bertolet said.

Toni Henthorn's relatives were not convinced her husband owned his own business, even though he would take regular work trips without explanation.

Bertolet said Harold Henthorn was reluctant to talk about the death of his first wife, Sandra Lynn Henthorn, 30, who was crushed to death in 1995 when a car slipped off a jack while she and Harold were changing a flat tire.  

Reports emerged showing that Dr Henthorn, who had one daughter, had life insurance policies to the value of $4.5 million - and that a claim was made on one of the policies just two days after her death.

The indictment says Harold Henthorn, who was the only witness to her death, 'willfully, deliberately, maliciously and with premeditation and malice aforethought did unlawfully kill his wife', CBS reported.

After she passed away, it emerged that his first wife had also died in mysterious circumstances, and the investigation into that death has since been re-opened.

Sandra Lynn Henthorn, 37, was crushed to death after the couple's car slipped off a jack while she and Harold Henthorn were trying to change a flat tire one late night  in 1995.

He told authorities that his wife had been reaching under the car to help him change the front tire on their Jeep Cherokee on the rural road, when the jack slipped.

Detectives closed the case just one week after the investigation, ruling the death an accident, but the Douglas County Sheriff's Office told CBS4 that they have now re-opened the investigation.

A source told the channel that Henthorn had taken out a $300,000 insurance policy on his wife.

It added that three life insurance policies had been taken out on his second wife - each valued at $1.5 million - and that efforts had been made to collect on it on the first business day after her death.

One of the policies named the Harold and Toni Henthorn Trust as the beneficiary and a claim was sent in for the policy on October 1, 2012, CBS reported. No payment was made, however.

It is not clear who attempted to file a claim for the policy. The claim was made before her body was cremated or a memorial service was held.

Dr Henthorn, an ophthalmologist, had been married to her husband for 12 years. She left behind a daughter, then seven.

Toni Henthorn's family told CBS4 that they learned of her husband's arrest on Thursday morning.

Her brother Todd Bertolet expressed relief that federal authorities had made an arrest.

'We've always had the utmost confidence in very talented people with the FBI and the National Park Service,' he said.

'We've always felt that justice would come one day and this is a satisfactory day in knowing that justice for Toni is proceeding along.'

Harold Henthorn's attorney, Craig Truman, added: 'We know when all the facts are known in this difficult case that justice will be done.'
