GCHQ 'losing web security experts' because they can't match Google's high salaries

Al Qaeda has explicitly called for ‘cyber-jihad’ and there have been a series of attempts by terrorists to ‘invade’ Facebook, the Government's new counter-terrorism strategy said today.

Terrorists are increasingly using online technology to plan and disguise attacks and there will be more cyber-terrorism in the future, it said.

‘Since the death of Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda has explicitly called not only for acts of lone or individual terrorism, but also for 'cyber-jihad',’ it added.

Home Secretary Theresa May launched the new counter-terrorism strategy which warned that since the death of Osama bin Laden Al 
Qaeda had called for 'cyber-jihad'

The use of social networking sites and video sharing is now ‘commonplace’, the strategy said. ‘There have been a number of attempts by terrorist and extremist groups to "invade" Facebook.

‘Twitter will be used to re-post media or forum articles enabling extremist content to be shared more quickly, widely and amongst people who would not normally search for extremist content.’

And experts have estimated that there are already thousands of terrorist-related websites, adding: 'A few dozen are highly influential and frequented by terrorists.'

The strategy comes the day after the UK threat level from international terrorism was downgraded from severe to substantial, meaning there is still a ‘strong possibility’ of an attack and one may well happen without further warning'.

Crimes linked to Facebook reached more than 100,000 across the country in the last five years, according to a report out in December.

Callers
have alerted officers to alleged acts of terrorism, sudden deaths, 
missing pets, sexual offences, hate crimes and even firearms offences.

Police
chiefs in 16 forces received 7,545 calls from the public last year, 
compared to just 1,411 calls related to Facebook to police in 2005.

The website launched in February 2004 and now has over 750million active users.

The
government is to launch another cyber strategy later this year, funded 
by part of the £650million put aside for cyber-security under their 
strategic defence and security review last October.

Launching the Government's counter-terrorism strategy, Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘Advances in technology mean our response must improve to keep pace.

‘Terrorists are increasingly using online technology, including Google Earth and Street View, for attack planning.’

She went on: ‘The marauding attacks in Mumbai in 2008 were directed by people using off-the-shelf secure communications technology to stay in contact with each other.

‘Software to encrypt mobile phone voice and text functions is widely available and improving.

‘Peer-to-peer networks can be used to distribute files and information rapidly and securely.

‘And cloud computing offers new means for storing, sharing and distributing material online.

‘It can be encrypted and configured to work with mobile devices, leaving little or no trace of the data behind.

‘And while radicalisation continues primarily to be a social process, terrorists are making more and more use of new technologies to communicate their propaganda.’

Mrs May added: ‘To tackle these new and emerging threats, our own technology must constantly evolve and adapt.’

Britain's top secret electronic spy agency - is struggling to retain key cyber security specialists because it cannot match the wages offered by firms such as Microsoft and Google, it was disclosed today.

The parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) said it was 'concerned' GCHQ was unable to retain a 'suitable cadre of internet specialists' to deal with the growing threat of cyber warfare.

In its annual report, the committee - made up of senior MPs and peers - also rebuked GCHQ for losing track of equipment worth up to £1 million over the past 10 years.

While it said that the majority of items attracted no security risk, GCHQ had admitted that in 5 per cent of cases - covering around 450 items - it could not guarantee that this was the case.

'Although the committee has no reason to believe national security has been compromised, the agencies must do all they can to avoid the loss of potentially sensitive equipment,' the report said.

'The public interest requires that GCHQ learns from the repeated mistakes of the past.'

The report disclosed that in evidence to the committee, the GCHQ director Iain Lobban said he was struggling to recruit and retain the 'real internet whizzes' he needed to counter the growing threat of cyber warfare.

'They will be working for Microsoft or Google or Amazon or whoever. And I can't compete with their salaries,' he said.

'Month-on-month, we are losing whizzes who'll basically say 'I'm sorry, I am going to take three times the salary and the car and whatever else'.'

Overall the committee expressed concern that the 11.3 per cent budget cut for the intelligence agencies - including MI5 and MI6 as well as GCHQ - imposed in the comprehensive spending review would affect their ability to 'maintain current levels of coverage of all aspects of the threat'.

It warned that the situation could worsen if inflation remained at current levels and said it was 'essential' that the spending review settlement could be reopened if there was a 'significant change in the threat'.

The ISC said that MI5, the Security Service, had given assurances it was able to respond to the increased terrorist threat in Northern Ireland, but the committee warned that in the context of declining resources, it would 'affect the service's capability in other areas, which is a matter of concern'.

At the same time, the committee warned that the 2012 London Olympics would 'inevitably' lead to resources being diverted from MI5's other work during that period and 'thus expose the UK to greater risk'.

'The National Security Council must take such steps as are necessary to minimise the risk to the UK,' the report said.
