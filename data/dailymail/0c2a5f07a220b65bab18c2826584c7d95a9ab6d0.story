Most holidaymakers will only see majestic killer whales in captivity at aquariums around the world.

But these sailors managed to capture a rare glimpse of orcas in the wild as they came within feet of the beautiful mammals.

Not only did the pod approach the sailing boat off the coast of Chile, the spectacular animals appeared unperturbed by their audience as they played with a dinghy tied to the back of their vessel.

The amazing up-close footage was filmed in Northern Patagonia, at the mouth of the Reloncavi Estuary.

The filmmaker Jose Jiminez said: 'I was sailing toward the estuary and in the distance I saw some weird splashes. There were no waves in the area, the wind had just picked up but in no means enough for walls of water seen from over a mile and a half away. 

'So as I got closer, I zoomed in with a telephoto lens and shot some pictures then zoomed into the picture and saw Orcas leaping out of the water! 

The young killer whales swim up extremely close to the boat as it motors along towards the estuary

The two whales seem to enjoy swimming in the drag of the boat underneath the small dinghy

'We kept on sailing and as we got closer, I turned the motor off and waited, I’ve been around whales before and know not to get in their way. 

'The juvenile Orcas came over with the Alpha male while the females stayed away with the baby calves.'

In the video, the two young orcas approach the boat and begin swimming behind where it is creating a drag.

The family caught the amazing scene on video before the young whales swam off to rejoin their pod

In the video, the viewers exclaim in Spanish: 'They are playing!'

The orcas can be seen swimming on their sides right under the small boat being dragged behind the fishing vessel as if they are playing.

While the larger whale waits further off, the two younger mammals criss cross under the boat and put on a show for the sailors.

Eventually, the playful whales swim off into the distance and back to their pod.
