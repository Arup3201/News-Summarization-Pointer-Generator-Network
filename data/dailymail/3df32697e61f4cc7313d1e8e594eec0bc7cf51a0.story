It took a trip to the capital of excess to help an overweight party girl realise it was time to change her ways.

After gaining a stone in just a week while on holiday in Las Vegas, Jazz Odeyingbo, 22, from Chelmsford, Essex, knew she had to take control of her weight problem. 

Jazz had already put on two stone in the months before her trip to the casino city, so by the time she flew home, she was 16 stone and a dress size 16.

Jazz, who works for her step-father, David King's, furniture company, said she didn't go on a bikini diet before her holiday. 

'There is a 24-hour McDonalds next to my flat and sometimes I would go there for breakfast, lunch and dinner,' she said.

Then while in Vegas, she enjoyed the large portions, all-you-can-eat buffets and indulgent cocktails to the full without worrying about her waistline. 

She explained: 'It was a crazy holiday where I would start the day with ice cream for breakfast, followed by pancakes with maple syrup. 

'For lunch and dinner I would just binge on the hotel buffet - going back for lots more helpings. 

'It was boiling hot so I'd be drinking highly sugared Fanta all day and then going boozing and clubbing at night. 

Beat the bulge: Jazz booked into a boot camp to help her lose weight

No pain, no gain: The 22-year-old found the exercise difficult at first but soon began to enjoy it and lose weight

'I worked out that I had put on 2lbs for each day of the holiday and a whopping stone for the whole week.' 

On her return, Jazz's boyfriend, Nile Morson, 24, didn't put any pressure on her to get in shape but Jazz's weight gain made her feel less confident. 

'I love going clubbing and enjoy getting a little attention for my looks and suddenly I wasn't getting any at all,' she said. 'It was because I was a size 16 and fat.' 

Jazz decided to beat the bulge head on by signing up for an extreme military-style boot camp popular with reality TV stars including The Only Way Is Essex's Gemma Collins and James 'Arg' Argent and Made In Chelsea's Binky Felstead and Spencer Matthews. 

Hard work: Jazz put her all into the boot camp activities and lost three stone in six weeks

Zip back: Now Jazz is feeling full of confidence

The celebrities have boasted of losing a stone in a week following the strict regimes laid down by their ex-special forces trainers at the No 1 Boot Camp in Norfolk. 

But the Boot Camp didn't come cheap and  Jazz had to ask her step-father if he could give her time off work and pay £4,000 for her to have a four-week stay.

She said: 'I was so shy and nervous. I could hardly speak to any of the other bootcampers because I was so anxious,' she said of her arrival. 

'On my second day of exercising I couldn't walk back from the beach as my legs were so sore, so they had to pick me up in the car while I was crying my eyes out. 

'I could hardly walk on the hikes in the afternoons and was always struggling along at the back.'

But she said the pounds started to come off giving her cause to carry on. 

'When I had my first week's weigh-in and I had lost 13lbs! 

'That was all the incentive I needed and I started pushing harder and harder,' she said.

Then by the end of her four-week booking, she wasn't ready to leave so extended her stay. 

'As I approached my fourth week, I knew that I was not ready to leave, so I booked another two weeks,' she explained. 

Working hard wasn't a problem for Jazz who put all her efforts into the workouts including long hikes and tough obstacle courses.

After six weeks, she had lost three stone and two dress sizes meaning she's now a size 12. 

'I lost three stone - all the weight and that extra flab I had put on in Vegas, she said. 'But more importantly I have totally turned life around.'

While the price tag might seem hefty Jazz says it was worth every penny for her. 

'I paid 4,000 because I wanted a single room on my own for such a long stay. 

'I could have done it more cheaply if I had shared. I was lucky that my step father helped me with the cost.

'It was money very well spent. You get full on fitness training throughout the week starting with the dreaded 7am wake-up call and ending with the equally dreaded ice bath which aids muscle recovery.

'What the trainers are trying to do is not just to achieve weight loss but promote overall lifestyle change. So you learn about nutrition and where you have been going wrong previously in your eating habits. They create exercise programmes suitable to you - they deal with a wide variety of clients, from heavily overweight people working out for the first time to fitness fanatics who are really honing their bodies.

'I was starting from scratch and really needed to learn how to exercise effectively and how to fuel my body in a healthy way which would promote weight.'I live a completely different life now following my experience at No 1 Boot Camp. I have ditched so many of my bad habits and the healthier options I am choosing now seem much more natural.' 

Now Jazz eats more healthily and exercises regularly and is so confident in her new body that she is launching a new online fashion business, Hanging Pretty. 

She said: 'When I was overweight I was depressed and had no confidence. Now I have got all my old zip back. I cannot wait to launch the new business and start a whole new chapter in my life.'
