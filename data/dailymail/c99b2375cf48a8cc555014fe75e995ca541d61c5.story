Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel have conducted a series of counter-terrorism exercises in Brisbane in preparation for the G20 summit next month.

Soldiers were tested by staged terrorism and hostage situations using tactical equipment, simulated ammunition and hand-held pyrotechnics at the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services Academy on Tuesday.

Defence have worked closely with state and federal agencies for 18 months to prepare for the summit, ADF commander for the G20 commitment Major General Stuart Smith said at the academy following the drills.

Authorities are also preparing for non-terror-related disruption from protesters, as it has emerged Queensland police will formally ban two individuals from attending the G20 summit and track destructive protest groups during final preparations for the event.

Much of the Brisbane CBD and South Bank area will become a restricted or declared zone from November 14, when a sophisticated security operation will be initiated to protect world leaders.

It will involve 4500 Queensland police officers, 1500 interstate and New Zealand officers, Australian Federal Police and defence.

More than 900 soldiers will be based in Brisbane for the event, with a further 1000 on call, however Maj Gen Smith said it would be up to the QPS or federal authorities to ask for assistance.

'It's really a background support that we're providing, only those niche search capabilities and counter-terrorism and air support that may be provided,' he said.

'So I surmise you won't see a great presence by the military.'

Authorities have also announce plans to open a 24-hour court to deal with the expected mass arrests.

The court, which will open on November 10, mirrors the approach of Toronto police during the 2010 summit, when 1100 people were arrested and dealt with in a specialised court.  

Specialist soldiers and military dogs would be used to sweep conference venues, hotels and waterways prior to the summit, he said.

Brisbane residents have been warned to expect further rehearsals by defence aircraft as they prepare for the summit.

Meanwhile, the number of known protest groups planning to attend the G20 has risen to 24.

Police are eager to communicate with protest groups but would not tolerate destructive behaviour, Assistant Commissioner Katarina Carroll said.

'We know from these events around the world, they do attract an element of people who will come to create disorder,' Ms Carroll told reporters in Brisbane.

'We're quite aware of who those groups are and certainly we'll be keeping an eye on them as we lead into G20.'

The two banned individuals would be served with official documents under special G20 legislation 'in the next week or two', but Ms Carroll would not comment on their identity.

As the summit draws nearer, speculation has mounted that international protest groups may be considering a presence in Brisbane.

The 'Black Bloc' technique used by some violent, anonymous protesters at past G20 events was one of numerous tactics used by groups, Ms Carroll said.

Police have information on Black Bloc protesters, but Ms Carroll refused to elaborate.

Locally, a number of online anarchist groups have emerged and threatened to hold violent protests before the summit.

One group, calling itself Plan B, says it opposes the G20 group of nations, who will meet on November 15-16 at Brisbane's Convention and Exhibition Centre.

Anonymous anarchists have posted on their website: 'We are encouraging individuals and groups to take action which they see as effective and necessary given their circumstances. We do not see property destruction as an inherently violent act.'

In a separate post, they wrote: 'While the p**s are helplessly patrolling the streets of Brisbane's CBD in their ridiculous armour with their intimidating vehicles, decentralised waves of creation and destruction will ebb and flow right across the country.' 

Other groups such as the Autonomous Action Radio, which broadcasts a weekly community radio show, has created posters which are on display across Brisbane depicting balaclava-clad protesters throwing objects and toppling over bins.

The poster carries the accompanying message 'Smash the G20. For decentralised attacks on capital in mid-November: Capitalism is stumbling, let's make sure it falls. ' 

Another recently formed group is the Brisbane Street Medics, who say they are 'Street Medics serving the activist community in Brisbane, Australia,' on their official Facebook page.

In addition to local factions, there are concerns that notorious international groups such as Black Bloc, thought to be responsible for the riot in the 2010 G20 summit in Toronto, are attempting to mobilise in Brisbane.

Associate Professor Janet Ransley, who heads Griffith University's School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, told Brisbane Times  'I think it would be naive to think that Black Bloc and some of those groups are not mobilising.

'I know there has been some chatter on social media about them trying to get a presence in Brisbane.' Ms Ransley said. 

Assistant Commissioner Katarina Carroll, who is responsible for the Queensland police's response to the G20 protests, says they will keep a close eye on all the groups involved.  

 'Our top priority at all times is to ensure that members of the Queensland community are safe. Our top priority at all times is to ensure that members of the Queensland community are safe,' Ms Carroll said. 

There are currently 21 planned protests to the event, but more clandestine are radical protests are expected to appear on the day.

The 2010 G20 Toronto summit protests saw $750,000 worth of damage wreaked on the streets, including police cars being set ablaze and mass looting of stores.
