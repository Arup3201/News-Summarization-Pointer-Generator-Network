Living life in the fast lane you wouldn't of thought there is much that could phase Formula One driver Daniel Ricciardo, but the Red Bull driver was left red-faced after an exchange with Kylie Minogue.

The duo appeared together on Australian TV show The Project on Monday as they seemed equally star-struck with one another.

Pop princess Minogue pulled out three pictures of the 25-year-old racer and asked him for autographs on each one of them.

'Can I ask A favour?' the singer said to Ricciardo. 'Can I get not one, not two, but three autographs?'

Ricciardo, who this week begins the 2015 season at his home Grand Prix in Melbourne, was clearly taken aback by the request.

'Is this serious? I'm blushing,' Ricciardo replied.

Minogue shared this picture of the pair laughing together on her official Instagram account

The Australian duo posed for a picture backstage, which the singer also uploaded to social media

The 25-year-old admitted that he was made to blush by the pop star after her request for an autograph

'One is for me and two for my nephews because I'm going to be the best auntie,' Minogue told Ricciardo.

The F1 racer then joked that she would be receiving an authentic signature unlike the copied version most fans get.

'This will be an authentic autograph - not one of those printed ones I give to all my fans,' he quipped.
