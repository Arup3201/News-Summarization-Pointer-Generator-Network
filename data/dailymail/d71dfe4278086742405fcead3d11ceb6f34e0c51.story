Dramatic footage of a polar bear tending her newborn cubs in the flagship BBC show Frozen Planet was filmed in a Dutch zoo using fake snow.

In one of the most engaging moments of its Winter episode, the tiny bears are shown mewling at their mother and nuzzling her for milk.

Eight million viewers were led to believe the scene had been captured by BBC cameramen inside an  underground cave in the brutal sub-zero temperatures of the Arctic wilderness.

Not as it seems: The 'den' in the wildlife park was constructed out of plaster and wood, built below the zoo's polar bear enclosure. It was fitted with cameras shortly before the birth

But the footage, narrated by Sir David Attenborough, and interspersed with real shots of the Arctic, was in fact filmed in a den made of plaster and wood in a wildlife enclosure.

The truth behind the fakery is only revealed in a hard-to-find video among 14 other clips accompanying the Winter episode of the series on the BBC website.

John Whittingdale MP, chairman of the Commons culture, media and sports committee, said it was ‘hugely disappointing’ viewers were misled. 

BBC editorial guidelines on wildlife programmes say that when it is impractical or unsafe to film something in the wild ‘it can be editorially and ethically justified to use captive animals’.

The guidelines add: ‘But we must never claim that such sequences were shot in the actual location depicted in the film.’

Mr Whittingdale said: ‘Broadcasters should not seek to give viewers a false impression. If this was not filmed in the wild it would have been much better to have made that clear in the commentary.

Faked? What the viewers saw on Frozen Planet turned out not to be filmed in the wild, but in a Netherlands zoo

Mixed: The scene was mixed with real footage of polar bears in the wild, which may have misled viewers

Panorama: The BBC apologised in June after it was found ‘likely’ that Panorama had faked scenes of boys said to be working in an Indian sweatshop. 

Blue Peter: BBC fined £50,000 in June 2007 after a young studio guest posed as a caller when the telephone system failed during a 2006 phone-in. 

Children in Need: A fictitious winner’s details were broadcast during Children in Need on BBC1 Scotland in November 2005 after no calls came through from the public. 

A Year With The Queen: BBC apologised to the Queen in 2007 after a trailer wrongly implied that she had stormed out of a sitting with photographer Annie Leibovitz. 

The Liz Kershaw Show: BBC6 Music found to have repeatedly faked competitions where no prizes existed and that callers had been members of the production team or their friends.

‘It is questionable how many people would
visit the website and find the video clip which explained the 
circumstances of the filming.’

The den scenes are featured in episode five of the BBC’s £16million Frozen Planet series.

At no point are viewers told they were filmed last Christmas in a den underneath a zoo’s polar bear enclosure. The den was fitted with cameras shortly before the birth of the cubs.

Only viewers who visited the  Frozen Planet website and found a video by the producer Kathryn Jeffs would have found the truth.

She said it would be impractical to 
film the carnivores in the wild, adding: ‘The problem for us is that they
give birth in these dens of ice and there’s absolutely no way we can 
get our cameras down there.’ 

The documentary drew in eight million viewers transfixed by moving scenes of a polar cub being born

This is not the first time Sir David Attenborough has been accused of misleading viewers in his wildlife documentaries.

In 1997, in the most memorable scene of Polar Bear, Arctic Warrior, a mother bear was filmed giving birth to and snuggling with her newborn cub. Viewers were led to believe the scene took place in the Arctic. In fact, it was filmed in a zoo in Frankfurt, Germany.

In 2001,
Sir David was accused of using deceptive techniques in Blue Planet when
it included a lobster spawning scene that was filmed in a British 
aquarium. Viewers were led to believe the scene was taking place off the
coast of Nova Scotia.

And in 2008, Sir David was accused of 
staging a confrontation between himself and a cobra in a South African 
desert for the series, Life in Cold Blood.

Sir David, 85, also defended the methods used by Frozen Planet. He said: ‘If you had tried to put a camera in the wild in a polar bear den, she would either have killed the cub or the cameraman.’

He added: ‘It’s not falsehood, and we don’t keep it secret either.’

The BBC said the way the scene had been captured was ‘clearly explained’ on the website.

It said it had received only five complaints following the revelations.

A spokesman added: ‘This particular sequence would be impossible to film in the wild.’

The series website has been extremely popular with our viewers, who regularly look at it for background information and extra clips from Frozen Planet.

'That segment was on the relevant programme page and the series website is given at the end of each episode.'
