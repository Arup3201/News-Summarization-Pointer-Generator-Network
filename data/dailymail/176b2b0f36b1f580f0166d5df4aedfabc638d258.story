Members of the 2011 Cronulla Sharks team could escape with bans of just one month if they admit to taking banned substances in their controversial supplements program, following an investigation that was labelled Australia's 'darkest day in sport'.

Players including captain Paul Gallen would need to accept heavily discounted suspensions of between one to six months in a bid to restore stability in the ailing club after 18 months of scrutiny over their supplements program.

The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) started investigating Cronulla in February 2013 over the use of banned substances during an 11 week period at the start of the 2011 season. 

Past and present Cronulla Sharks including captain Paul Gallen could face bans of up to six months as part of the ASADA investigation

The Sharks have paid a high price as a result of the investigation, which has set the club back $4 million, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

The club faces finishing the NRL competition in last position after losing all but five games this season. Coach Shane Flanagan was suspended and the club has played most of this season without a sponsor due to the drug scandal and it paid a $600,000 fine to the NRL.

AFL club Essendon have also faced scrutiny following a supplements scandal.

Thirty-four current and former Essendon players were issued show-cause notices in June by the anti-doping agency.

Coach James Hird was suspended ahead of the club's hierarchy launching legal action against the ASADA investigation last week as their battle continues.  

It's believed 17 Sharks players will be offered bans of up to six months and all would be back playing after the first month of next season.

The retirement of John Morris will mean only six players will remain from those who played in 2011.

Remaining players Sam Tagataese and Ricky Luetele were cleared by ASADA, as well as New Zealand Warrior Chad Townsend.

But that means captain Paul Gallen, Anthony Tupou, Nathan Gardner and Wade Graham could still face sanctions at the ends of the season.

If Gallen was to be suspended he would miss the Four Nations tournament for Australia.

No players would be able to train with their clubs or have an official role until after the ban.

Former Sharks players at other clubs are expected to be offered similar deals including Gold Coast's Luke Douglas and Albert Kelly, Newcastle's Jeremy Smith and Kade Snowden and North Queensland player Matthew Wright.

Other players including Ben Pomeroy, Paul Aiton and Josh Cordoba moved into Super League.

During 2011, 31 players were used during the season, but it's believed the investigation targeted 17 who played from round two to five.

Players have claimed their innocence throughout the investigation.

Gallen previously said he never considered taking a bans for being 'truthful and honest'.

On the eve of State of Origin II Gallen said said the stress of the investigation had effected the mental health of players and even prevented him and his wife having another child.

'From day one, from the time Cronulla got brought into it which was a week or so after that press conference, I don't know anything,' Gallen said.

'Nothing has changed for me. I have been told to turn up to a meeting. I turned up at that meeting. Other than that, I don't know anything.'
