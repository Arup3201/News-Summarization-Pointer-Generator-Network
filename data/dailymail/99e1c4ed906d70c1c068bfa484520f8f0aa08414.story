South Africa batsman AB de Villiers scored the fastest-ever one-day international century as South Africa piled on the runs in a crushing 148-run defeat of the West Indies.

The number three needed 31 deliveries to reach the milestone in the second ODI in Johannesburg, five fewer than previous record holder Corey Anderson, who needed 36 balls to pass the mark against the same opposition last year.

The Proteas ended their innings on 439 for two, four runs shy of the highest ever ODI score by a team - set by Sri Lanka in 2006 against Holland.

And it was a target that proved well beyond the tourists, who reached 291 for seven in reply with Dwayne Smith (64) and Denesh Ramdin (57) the highlights of a respectable - if futile - chase.

1. 31 balls - AB De Villiers (South Africa vs West Indies, Johannesburg, January 2015)

2. 36 balls – Corey Anderson (New Zealand vs West Indies, Queesntown, January 2014)

3. 37 balls – Shahid Afridi (Pakistan vs Sri Lanka, Nairobi, October 1996)

4. 44 balls – Mark Boucher (South Africa vs Zimbabwe, Potchefstroom, September 2006)

5. 45 balls – Brian Lara (West Indies vs Bangladesh, Dhaka, October 1999)

= 45 balls – Shahid Afridi (Pakistan vs India, Kanpur, April 2005)

South Africa openers Hashim Amla and Rilee Rossouw also scored centuries as they made 247 in just over 38 overs for the first wicket.

Rossouw scored 128 from 115 balls before he was caught at mid-off to give Jerome Taylor a wicket, while Amla finished unbeaten on 153 from 142 deliveries.

But it was largely the De Villiers show and he quickly broke Sanath Jayasuriya's 19-year record for the fastest ODI fifty, taking a mere 16 deliveries to achieve the feat by launching Jason Holder over the long-off boundary.

He then needed a further 15 balls to break Anderson's year-old fastest ODI century record - smashing 10 sixes and eight fours in doing so.

Any West Indian hopes that De Villiers would subsequently relax were soon dismissed as he and Amla continued to pepper the New Wanderers Stadium boundary on regular occasion.

De Villiers soon set his sights on breaking another record - the most sixes in an individual ODI innings - and equalled the record Rohit Sharma set in 2013 against Australia when he smashed his 16th maximum on the penultimate ball of the penultimate over.

The wicketkeeper-batsman could not score another to make the record his own, however, when he went for another huge hit off Andre Russell and was caught at deep extra cover with two balls left having scored 149 from 44 balls.

De Villers received a standing ovation from the crowd at the Wanderers as he made his way off the field, and he was saluted by West Indian batsman Chris Gayle.

De Villiers and Gayle, who are team-mates in the Indian Premier League with the Royal Challengers Bangalore, then shook hands just before end end of South Africa's innings. 

Amla and David Miller saw out proceedings for South Africa, while West Indies' daunting task became even more difficult when Chris Gayle pulled Morne Morkel to Farhaan Behardien for 19.

Leon Johnson came and went for a single but Smith and Marlon Samuels tried to make a fight of it with a fourth-wicket stand of 59 before the former was removed by Behardien.

Vernon Philander then ended Samuels' stay on 40 before another successful partnership of 83 was built between Ramdin and Jonathan Carter.

However, the runs could not come quickly enough despite their best efforts and Carter fell for 40 to Dale Steyn with Russell soon following for a duck.

De Villiers is all smiles after hitting a century against the West Indies at the Wanderers Stadium

1. 443-9 – SRI LANKA vs Netherlands, Amstelveen, July 2006

2. 439-2 – SOUTH AFRICA vs West Indies, Johannesburg, January 2015

3. 438-9 – SOUTH AFRICA vs Australia, Johannesburg, March 2006

4. 434-4 – AUSTRALIA vs South Africa, Johannesburg, March 2006

5. 418-5 – SOUTH AFRICA vs Zimbabwe, Potchefstroom, September 2006

= 418-5 – INDIA vs West Indies, Indore, December 2011

Ramdin was the last wicket to fall, Faf du Plessis taking the catch at deep square leg to give Morkel his second scalp, with the damage largely done before West Indies had even arrived at the crease.

Speaking on Sky Sports, De Villiers said: 'I think I was on 92 when I realised it had to be close.

'I was never sure how many balls it was that Corey Anderson took to get to 100 but I knew I had to be close and I wasn't going to take ones in the 90s. 

'(Coach) Russell (Domingo) actually made a really good call towards the end of the innings asking me to go in. I wanted David (Miller) to go in to go and take the left-arm spinner on.

'I sort of played my knock even before I went out to bat and the word aggression was probably the thing for me today. I wanted to go from the word go.'
