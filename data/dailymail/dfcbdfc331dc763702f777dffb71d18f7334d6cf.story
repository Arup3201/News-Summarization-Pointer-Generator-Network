Hundreds of bailiffs plan to start bulldozing Dale Farm tomorrow, after the travellers finally lost their court battle to stay on the illegal site.

A Court of Appeal judge yesterday put an end to their farcical attempts to stop their eviction, following years of protracted legal wrangling.

Bailiffs and police officers will begin moving into key positions next to Europe's largest illegal traveller site today.

A source close to the £22million operation said officials will attempt to gauge the strength  of the opposition on Tuesday before forcing their way through the barricades on Wednesday.

Last night menacing anarchists living on the site in Crays Hill, Essex, went into 'lockdown' to stop bailiffs entering.

The huge metal gates at the front of the site were locked and every other entry point was heavily fortified with high  metal fencing, barbed wire, gas cylinders, car tyres and old washing machines.

Dozens of activists returned to the site yesterday in the hope of taking part in the 'Battle of Basildon'. One shouted: 'This time it’s war - bring it on.'

Protesters send out emails and text messages to sympathetic friends in an attempt to increase their numbers.

A month ago Basildon Council, which is responsible for clearing the greenbelt site, sent hundreds of bailiffs to Dale Farm to start the eviction.

But they were forced to turn back from the illegal camp after the travellers’ lodged an 11th hour legal bid to stay.

Should the Dale Farm travellers be forcibly removed?

This time Basildon Council will not tell the travellers exactly when they plan to evict them in an attempt to stop any last minute delays.

Tony Ball, leader of the council said: ‘We will not be giving further notice of when a site clearance will now begin.

‘We are required to give 48-hours-notice to three plots and that we will do but the rest of the site will now be cleared at a time of our choosing.

‘The recent court proceedings were merely a temporary suspension. Our job is now to clear this site in a safe and dignified manner and this is what we intend to do.’

At the Court of appeal yesterday Lord
Justice Sullivan said there was no evidence likely to persuade appeal 
judges that the council's decision to enforce eviction notices was 
unlawful.

He said there
would be a ‘loss of public confidence’ if the breaches of planning law 
and breaches of criminal law were allowed to continue.

Applications for three judicial reviews, which sought to argue that the eviction was in breach of the travellers’ human rights, were turned down.

Travellers moved onto the greenbelt site a decade ago after the buying land and set up homes without planning permission.

The eviction is expected to cost up to £22million and involve around 400 residents being removed from the site, including about 100 children.

Len Gridley, 52, who has spent a decade fighting for the travellers to be evicted from land at the bottom of his garden, said he was cautiously optimistic that the clearance would start soon. 

Or will you? The travellers now face removal by bailiffs if they refuse to leave the land

‘I think they might actually have reached a point where it could happen but until I have waved goodbye to that last caravan I will never be sure,’ he said.

‘We have been at this point already before and then the travellers have another trick up their sleeve so we shall see.’

Candy Sheridan, vice-chair of the Gypsy Council and an adviser to the Dale Farm travellers, said: ‘It seems like the end of the road.’

Dale Farm resident Kathleen McCarthy 
added: 'The lawyers say this is the end. We'll have to fight the 
bailiffs off. We're already in lockdown.'

'We've been left with no choice - we really have nowhere else to go. Do you think we'd put ourselves through this if we did?

'The
law is prejudiced against travellers. We were told 15 years ago to get 
off the road and buy our own land, but now they are forcing us and our 
kids out on to the road again.

'The barricades are all that stand between
us and homelessness now.'
