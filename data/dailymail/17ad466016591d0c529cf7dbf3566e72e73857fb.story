Simon Cowell and Rylan Clark have both admitted to freezing time with the help of Botox - and it seems that the public are catching on.

One Harley Street clinic has seen male patient visits increase by 25 per cent during 2013.

Dr Yannis Alexandrides, founder of 111 
Harley Street, has seen a rapidly growing male patient base over the 
past five years, with demand reaching unprecedented levels this year.

Speaking about the rise, he said: ‘Men used to book appointments first thing in the morning or late at night so there was no risk of being faced with a waiting room with other people; there was a genuine fear of the stigma attached to visiting a cosmetic surgeon.

'Male patients now visit during peak hours, whether it be on a lunch break for a Botox treatment, or taking an afternoon off for an anti-ageing Fraxel laser session.'

The demand for non-surgical treatments showed peaks at certain times during the year, with an influx pre-Christmas and during February bonus season.

This is reportedly down to workers aiming to look 'calm and de-stressed'.

'Workers are under tremendous pressure to achieve, and my male patients want lasting results that look natural.

'A
 single Botox treatment can last four months while the thought of 
applying cosmetics each day is daunting', Dr Alexandrides explained.

His clinic isn't the only one seeing an increase in Brotox.

In 2012 The Private Clinic on Harley Street treated three times as many men with Botox as it did in 2011 with patient numbers set to have risen further by the end of 2013.

Men now account for almost 20 per cent of Botox patients at The Private Clinic’s UK-wide practices.

Dr Dennis Wolf, Joint Medical Director at The Private Clinic of Harley Street, said: 'I think it’s fair to say that today men have a more open attitude towards cosmetic procedures. I also think men are now more aware of the treatments that are available to them.

'If we look back 5-10 years, you would find a far lower number of men willing to have cosmetic treatments to improve the way they look; not because they did not want to undergo the procedure, but perhaps because they were embarrassed or did not want others to see them as vain. 

'Now, however, perceptions have changed and people don’t associate cosmetic treatments solely with women.

'Also, increasingly men in the public eye are looking younger and healthier far later in life. This is another factor that may be having an impact on the number of men considering the possibility of undergoing cosmetic procedures.

'Over time the age range of men that I have treated with Botox has also widened. Where it was once predominately men in their 30s, now I see more men in their 40s and 50s. I also treat men in a wider range of professions.

'Those whose appearance is an important part of their job, those in competitive environments and those who have to have direct contact with clients or customers every day, are the men I probably see most often. 

'The priority for a lot of men is to look subtly younger by removing or reducing the visibility of lines around the eyes, forehead and mouth.'
