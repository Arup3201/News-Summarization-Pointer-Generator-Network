With their emotion and precise detail, these images look like the work of a gifted photographer.

But in fact they are all hyper-realistic paintings and drawings created by Scottish artist Paul Cadden.

The 49-year-old travelled around the world taking thousands of photographs of everyday situations to draw when he returned home.

Stunning: This spectacular drawing, created by artist Paul Cadden, from Glasgow, Scotland, depicts a man walking with an umbrella in Hong Kong

Emotive: The 49-year-old travelled around the world taking thousands of photographs of everyday situations, such as this elderly couple sitting on a step in Barcelona

Realistic: He then brought the photos - including these two women - to life by recreating the images on a piece of regular paper using an ordinary pencil or paints

He then brought the photos to life by recreating the images on a piece of regular paper - using just an ordinary pencil and watercolour paints.

His spectacular works include an 
elderly couple sitting on a step in Barcelona, a man walking with an umbrella in 
Hong Kong and stunning close-up portraits.

The images recreate the photos in incredible detail - from the wrinkles on an old man's face to the small words on a leaflet.

It is no surprise then that it takes Mr Cadden up to three months to complete one painting or drawing.

Hyperrealism was born from photorealism, which are paintings based on photographs but created in a non-photographic medium.

Mr Cadden, from Glasgow, Scotland, said: 'I travelled to China and went to Hong Kong for three weeks because I was invited to give a talk to a school about my work.

Incredible: Mr Cadden's paintings and drawings recreate the photos in incredible detail - from the wrinkles on an old man's face to the small print on these empty cans

Worth the time: It takes Mr Cadden up to three months to complete each work of art. He chose to recreate his favourite photographs out of around 20,000 pictures

'In my spare time I walked around 
Hong Kong, and I also visited Guangzhou in China. I then travelled to 
Barcelona in Spain and once again took pictures of everyday situations 
and scenarios.

'I was constantly taking photographs - I probably took around 20,000 pictures.'

The artist said he particularly enjoys drawing 'ordinary' people in 'everyday' situations.

'All
 of my pictures are just of ordinary people doing normal and everyday 
things,' he said. 'I think there is a real beauty in the simplistic 
nature of my work.

True to life: The artist's collection features a body of work entitled 'Scottish landscapes'. The images, including this watercolour painting, depict grim and grotty areas of the country

'We now live in the world of Instagram and people are constantly taking photographs - but do we actually look at what we are taking pictures of?'

Mr Cadden's collection features a body of work entitled 'Scottish landscapes' - depicting grim and grotty areas of the country.

'I was born in Glasgow and I can say in my 49 years of living here, nothing has changed,' he said.

'When most people think of Scottish landscapes they imagine the highlands, countryside, tartan and bagpipes. But there are a lot of people living in poverty in the city.

'Nothing has changed': This black-and-white pencil drawing shows litter on the streets of Glasgow. Mr Cadden hopes it will encourage discussion on the 'real' Scotland

Unbelievable: The artist said he particularly enjoys drawing 'ordinary' people in 'everyday' situations

'I wanted to start a debate about what people think of Scotland. Of course there are lovely parts to the country, but there are also some areas which are pretty grim. It's great to get people's thoughts on the real Scotland.'

Some of the pictures are watercolour paintings which took the artist around six weeks to complete.

'I've been drawing since I was six years old and have wanted to be an artist for as long as I can remember,' said Mr Cadden.

'Hyperrealism tends to create an emotional, social and cultural impact and differs from photorealism which is far more technical.

Precise: Mr Cadden puts the finishing touches to his hyper-realistic drawing of a man walking with an umbrella in Hong Kong

Amazing: The artist poses with his completed masterpiece. He claims his work is different to that of other hyper-realist artists because he uses a pencil instead of an airbrush

'I take everyday objects and scenes of people and then create a drawing which carries an emotional impact - it can be quite beautiful.

'Some of the drawings take me up to three months to complete as I can't stay on the same picture for too long - it drives me mad.

'What makes me different from other hyperrealist artists is that I predominantly work in pencil, while many others tend to use an airbrush.'
