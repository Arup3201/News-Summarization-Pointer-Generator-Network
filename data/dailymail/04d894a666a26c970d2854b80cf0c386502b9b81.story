Jon Bon Jovi was pictured just hours before his daughter allegedly overdosed on heroin at her $55,000-a-year liberal arts college.

Stephanie Rose Bongiovi, 19, is set to face court on multiple drug charges after police discovered heroin and marijuana in her dorm room at Hamilton College in Upstate New York.

She was released from the hospital on Wednesday after the frightening emergency that had her rushed to the hospital at 2am.

Officers visited Stephanie, Bon Jovi's only daughter, in her hospital bed and charged her with possession of heroin, marijuana possession, criminally using drug paraphernalia and a marijuana citation.

The aging rock star, 55, has declined to comment, but has remade himself from a 1980s sex symbol into a responsible father of four living in suburban Red Bank, New Jersey.

On Tuesday afternoon, Bon Jovi appeared at a groundbreaking ceremony for the JBJ Soul Homes, a low-income housing project in Philadelphia that bears his name.

The $16million development is funded, in part, by his charity.

The ceremony drew 200 people, including Mayor Michael Nutter and leaders of the Greater Exodus Baptist Church, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.

Just hours later, Stephanie was rushed to the hospital from her dorm room at Hamilton - a well respected, $55,000-a-year liberal arts institution school called a 'Little Ivy' for its rigorous academics and high entrance standards.

Stephanie - also an aspiring model - was not handcuffed or fingerprinted, though she will have to make a court appearance in the coming days.

Police also arrested and charged 21-year-old student Ian S. Grant, also from Red Bank, who was in the room with Stephanie Bongiovi at the time of her overdose.

MailOnline contacted representatives for the Bon Jovi frontman - who had no comment on the matter for the time being.

Hamilton College has released a 
statement, saying it is co-operating with the police investigation - but
would not say what action it will be taking against Stephanie.

It says say the 'alleged actions' not
only violate state law, but also contravene college policy - stressing 
the primary concern is with 'the safety of our students'.

The statement, obtained by WKTV, reads: 'The 
college is cooperating with the police investigation. 

'Our first concern 
is always for the safety of our students. Out of respect for the privacy
of our students and in accordance with federal regulations we do not 
discuss individual health or disciplinary matters.'

Stephanie is Jon's only daughter and the oldest of his four children, who he shares with wife Dorothea Hurley.

The news will no doubt come as a huge blow to Jon, 50, who these days prides himself on his family-man reputation.

The singer has been married to his 
wife Dorothea - his childhood sweetheart - for 23 years and is regarded 
as having one of the strongest marriages in Hollywood.

He has admitted to dabbling in drugs himself in the past - but says he 'wised up quickly'.

In
a 2007 interview with Best Life magazine, he confessed: 'I did the drug
thing very young and wised up very young too, because I 
was into drugs a little too much.

'I've never been a drug guy.
I've always felt I didn't have the mental stability to handle drugs.'

Bon Jovi is scheduled to perform at a benefit concert for Hamilton in Times Square on December 5.
