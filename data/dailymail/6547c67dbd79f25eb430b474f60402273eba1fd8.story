Chris Hughton will be a leading contender to replace Pepe Mel should he leave West Bromwich next week.

Baggies boss Mel will hold summit talks with chairman Jeremy Peace following Sunday's clash against Stoke, with the Spaniard expected to leave Hawthorns next week.

Peace has already begun looking at candidates to replace the Spaniard, while talks with prospective new signings are taking place under the proviso that Mel will leave the club.

And Sportsmail understands Hughton is fast emerging as the Midlands club's top managerial target.

The 55-year-old has been out of work since being dismissed by Norwich at the start of April and would give major consideration to taking the reins at West Brom.

Malky Mackay, who is able to work again after dropping his legal case against Cardiff, is also a contender.

Mel has been earmarked as a potential replacement for Bernd Schuster at La Liga club Malaga, an opportunity that could give the 51-year-old a chance to make an instant return to the game.

The manager has virtually assured West Brom's top-flight status going into the final game of the season, but has won just three of 16 games since his arrival in January.
