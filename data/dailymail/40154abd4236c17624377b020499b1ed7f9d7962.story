Police who smashed their way into the home of a 75-year-old grandmother after mistaking her bungalow for a drugs den have apologised - by giving the pensioner an orchid.

Shirley Williams feared police had arrived to deliver bad news about her husband Geoff who was in hospital after a major cancer operation when she spotted an officers running across her front garden.

But instead of hearing the doorbell ring, the pensioner was stunned when officers battered their way through her UPVC front door at 8.50am in the morning.

Ordeal: Police burst into the home of Shirley Williams, 75, after mistaking her bungalow in Deganway, Llandudno, for a drugs den

She said: 'There was an almighty bang three times as they battered the door. I went to the door and police were shouting "open the door". I had the keys in my pocket.

'As I opened the door a plainclothes policeman came across and said "stop, I think we have got it wrong".'

Mrs Williams had moved into the rented bungalow in a normally quiet neighbourhood at Deganwy, Llandudno, only days earlier. North Wales police were seeking a previous tenant who’d moved out weeks earlier.

The retired cook, who has angina and a 
pacemaker fitted, said today: 'It was terrible. Someone must have known 
he had gone because the house had been empty since August until we moved
in.

Damage: Four officers battered down the door of Mrs Williams' home - leaving a large crack visible

'If patrols had been coming up and down the road they could have seen this. I wonder why someone hasn’t checked?

'It was terrifying. I’ve had the doors locked and the lights on since. I’ve been trembling.

'I know they have to do their job but it’s something the police ought to watch. It could have been someone who had a heart attack with the shock. It might have been tragic for someone else.'

There were believed to be four officers in all. Paramedics were called to check her over after the shock of the encounter.

A plainclothes officer and another policeman later turned up with an orchid as an apology for the mistake. Mrs Williams added: 'They kept saying "we’re sorry, we’re sorry, we thought he was here".'

Mrs Williams is now waiting for a new door.

Chief Inspector Andrew Williams said: 'Officers attended at an address in Deganwy last week as part of a series of pro-active warrants executed across Conwy and Denbighshire. On entering the address and speaking to the occupier it became apparent that the previous tenants had very recently moved out.

'Officers apologised immediately to the occupant and checked upon her welfare. An officer has since visited the occupier again to extend our sincere apologies.

'Arrangements are also in hand to repair damage caused.'
