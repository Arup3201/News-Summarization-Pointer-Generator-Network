Rapist: Defendant Sir Young, 20, pleaded guilty to the rape of a fellow student at Booker T. Washington High School, Dallas, when he was 18 and she was 14

A high school rapist has been ordered to do 250 hours volunteer work - at a rape crisis center.

Defendant Sir Young, 20, had pleaded guilty to the rape of a fellow pupil at Booker T. Washington High School, Dallas, when he was 18 and she was 14.

He was facing up to 20 years in prison, but State District Judge Jeanine Howard stunned the Dallas court by making the bizarre order as part of a five-year probation sentence.

Prosecutor Josh Healy said Young's victim, who is now 17, had been left in tears by the ruling and that she and her family told him they were 'shocked'  and 'extremely disappointed'.

And now Judge Howard has been forced into an embarrassing U-turn after the chief of the local rape crisis center refused to allow Young to carry out the community service portion of his sentence there.

Bobbie Villareal, executve director of the Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center, told WFAA.com: 'I’m sure she probably thought that it was his way of giving back perhaps.

'But it’s just not an appropriate place for him to do his community supervision.'

Ms Villareal slammed the 'lenient' conditions passed down by Judge Howard, who is known in legal circles for her creative approach to sentencing.

'It is a deterrent to all survivors when you see a very lenient sentence like this passed down,' she said.

'It sends a devastating message to survivors of sexual assault. That victim’s family definitely didn’t feel like there was justice for her and for other survivors of sexual assault.'

Young's sentence of deferred adjudication probation means that if he meets various terms laid down by Judge Howard, he will not have a permanent criminal record.

As well as the community service order, he must also spend 45 days in jail, as well as a further 24 hours in jail every October 4 - the date of the rape - for the duration of his probation.

It came after Young admitted raping the girl at school in October 2011.

Changes: Booker T. Washington High School has since added a window to the room where the rape happened

The court heard that the pair were kissing in a practice room at the performing arts school, but that she had told him to stop when he began rubbing her body, reported Dallas Morning News.

Ignoring her pleas, he instead pulled off her leggings and raped her.

'I didn’t want to do anything other than kiss,' the victim told the court, adding that she had told Young 'no' and 'stop' before and during the attack.

Booker T. Washington High School has since added a window to the room and installed CCTV cameras.
