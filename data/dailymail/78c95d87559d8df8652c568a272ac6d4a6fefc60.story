Strivers in work will be hit less hard than the workless by plans to cap state benefits, figures suggest.

Labour will today vote against plans to cap increases in welfare handouts at one per cent for the next three years, saying six out of ten people hit by the changes will be in work.

But the Institute for Fiscal Studies yesterday released figures showing that workers will lose less than those who live entirely on benefits.

The IFS said 7million workers would lose an average of £165 a year, while  2.8million without a job will lose £215 a year in 2015-16 – a £50 bigger hit to those who don’t work.

Ministers say a working couple will also see their income tax cut by £1,200 as a result of changes to the personal  allowance, which come in from April, far outweighing the losses to tax credits.

Former home secretary Jacqui Smith said it will let the Tories 'paint us as a party which cares more about those unwilling to work than those struggling in work'

But the IFS also revealed that the proportion of those hit by the changes would fall far more heavily on the workless.

While nine in ten workless households will see their entitlements reduced, 3million of the 7million working families hit will be affected only by a cap in rises to child benefit and only 4million will lose out as a result of other changes.

If just working tax credits are counted, three out of ten people in work will lose out.

Today’s vote has been called by the Government to try to lay out a key dividing line ahead of the next election.

Some Labour MPs believe Ed Miliband and Ed Balls have put Labour on the wrong side of public opinion by opposing the cap, which polls suggest is popular with voters.

Former home secretary Jacqui Smith said it will let the Tories ‘paint us as a party which cares more about those unwilling to work than those struggling in work’.

The Tory Party has released figures showing that Labour has opposed welfare savings that amount to £83billion by 2015/16 and would have to raise borrowing or debt by the equivalent of £5,000 per family.

The Tories are unveiling a campaign poster that says: ‘Today Labour are voting to increase benefits by more than workers’ wages. Conservatives: Standing Up for Working People.’
