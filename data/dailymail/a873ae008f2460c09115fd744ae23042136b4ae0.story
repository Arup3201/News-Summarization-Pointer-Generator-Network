The first human cases of a mosquito borne virus, previously only found in animals, have been found in Vermont causing widespread fear of an impending epidemic.

The Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) virus, which can be deadly a third of the time, has struck two victims who have been hospitalized with flu like symptoms.

But health officials fear the virus could develop into a serious strain of the illness that can be fatal.

Public health officials fear the easy spread of the mosquito-borne virus, similar to the West Nile virus

The two cases for the state were found in residents in Rutland and Addison counties, in western Vermont, though no information has been released about the identities of the patients.

In humans, the virus can develop into two types of illness.

The first, which is least worrisome, causes flu like symptoms and typically lasts one or two weeks.

But the more serious form attacks the central nervous system, causing fever, headache, irritability, restlessness, drowsiness, convulsions and coma.

It causes death in a third of all cases, which have been found mainly in Massachusetts, and can leave survivors with serious neurological damage.

'It's impossible to tell which people will develop the more severe illness,' Vermont State Epidemiologist Dr Patsy Kelso told WFFF-TV.

'Like I said with eastern equine virus a number of people develop that more serious illness and it's fatal about a third of the time,' she added.  

EEE is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito and has been found in other areas in New England

EEE is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito and has been found in other communities across New England.

In Vermont, it was first discovered in emus in the state in September 2011.

There is a vaccine for horses, emus, llamas and alpacas but no vaccine for humans.

'Last year there was an emu farm that had a die off from eastern equine and so we've been anticipating that we might see some human cases and unfortunately we have this year,' Kelso said.

'The reason we're seeing it here now is the weather. Hot dry summers are perfect for mosquitoes, conditions that have been seen all over Vermont this year.'

Public health officials in Vermont fear the fast spread of the illness and local officials are working on measures to keep the virus contained.

Officials in Vermont will spray pesticides to control the mosquito population, using aerial spraying similar to this twin-engine plane used in Dallas to control the West Nile virus

The EEE virus, as well as West Nile Virus, were both detected in mosquito pools in the two counties.

The Vermont Department of Health and Agency of Agriculture will be spraying pesticides from aircraft to control mosquitoes.

'The severe form of EEE is a terrible disease, and we want to take every reasonable action to prevent people from becoming infected,' Health Commissioner Harry Chen said in a statement.

'These viruses will continue to circulate until the first freeze. Although spraying will help reduce the risk of infection, it's important that we all take personal precautions to avoid mosquito bites no matter where we live,' the statement added.

In addition to spraying for mosquitoes, officials are warning Vermont residents to wear long sleeves shirts and pants and to avoid being outdoors after dark.#

The West Nile virus was first discovered in the U.S. in 1999.

So far in 2012, 66 people have died from West Nile virus infections and the number of people infected is now at 1,590, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
