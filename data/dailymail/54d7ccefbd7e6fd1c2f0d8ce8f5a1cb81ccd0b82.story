An urgent probe is under way into exam marking amid claims some teachers are checking A-level and GCSE scripts in the pub or early in the morning before a full day at work.

Exams watchdog Ofqual announced it was conducting a major review of the quality of marking amid concern that thousands of pupils are being awarded the wrong grades.

A dossier produced by head teachers last month lifted the lid on ‘truly shocking’ problems including ‘rogue’ markers and wild fluctuations in results.

The unprecedented inquiry – due to report in spring next year – will expose what is ‘good, bad and indifferent’ about marking, what checks are in place to ensure errors are picked up and whether schools are receiving value for money.

More than 15million GCSE and A-level papers are marked every summer in six weeks.

According to a report last month by the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, representing 250 private schools, marking is blighted by ‘persistent and widespread incompetence’.

It said the ‘malaise’ ran far deeper than this year’s problems with GCSE English, which have attracted hundreds of complaints and a legal challenge over late changes to grade bands.

Speaking at a conference staged by Cambridge Assessment, which runs the OCR board, Ofqual chief Glenys Stacey said: ‘We need to listen to what we’re told about the quality of exam marking.’

Questioning Mrs Stacey, Bernadette Brooks, of DRS Data Services which works with exam boards, said: ‘What about the support for teachers in the classroom who we have online at five o’clock every morning on our systems and they come en masse at 4.30 again in the evening during that very pressurised [marking] period?’

'You get the stories about the people who do it down
the pub over a pint with the football match on in the background'

Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the inquiry had ‘huge issues’ to address. ‘You get the stories about the people who do it down the pub over a pint with the football match on in the background,’ he added.

Graham Stuart, Tory chairman of the Commons Education Select Committee, said: ‘What I hope comes out of the Ofqual review is a better understanding of the pressures involved and the trade off that needs to take place to make it work.’
