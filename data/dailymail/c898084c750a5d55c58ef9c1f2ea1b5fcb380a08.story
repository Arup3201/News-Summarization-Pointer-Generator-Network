A devoted wife died of cancer after washing her husband and son's work overalls everyday for 20 years.

Grandmother Valerie Ward, 78, breathed in asbestos fibres as she shook out her painter husband Eric and son Adrian's work clothes, with the couple both contracting cancer.

While Eric survived Valerie died just ten weeks after being diagnosed with mesothelioma on her lungs, an inquest heard.

A verdict of death by industrial disease was recorded confirming that she died from 
mesothelioma as the result of washing the overalls when her husband and son 
returned from Aberthaw Power Station near Cardiff.

Her daughter Avril Ward, 49, said: 'Mum died probably 10 years before she should have.

'My dad worked at the power station for 20 odd years and was a fitter's mate before he became a painter there.

'Mum always washed his overalls after work. She wasn't aware of the dangers of the dust and fibres on them.

'He lost a lot of colleagues and friends to mesothelioma. Not a lot was known about it then and very little protection was offered at that time.'

Husband Eric, now 85, is being treated for asbestos plaques in his lungs but has been left devastated mourning his wife.

Avril said: 'Mum and dad were sweethearts and had a fantastic life together.

'They did everything together and when dad retired they travelled the world and had 58 wonderful years together.

'It was just 10 weeks from when mum was diagnosed to when she died. It was very quick.'

Her family won a compensation payment of £8,775 which was donated to a hospice run by the Marie Curie Cancer Care charity.

Valerie, of Barry, South Wales, died in the Holm Towers hospice run by the charity.

Her daughter said: 'Mum went to Holm Towers and we were very grateful she was able to go to the hospice as she had multiple cancers.

'We want people to be made aware of asbestos as it doesn't come out until later in life long after you've been exposed to it.

'It's a shock to lose a parent and as quickly as we did.

'Whatever we were going to get was always going to go to Holm Towers. It's nice to be able to give something back they were amazing.'

A spokesman for solicitors Lyons Davidson, who worked with the family, said Britain has the highest incidences of mesothelioma in the world.

She said: 'Twice as many people in this country die from mesothelioma as die in road accidents.'
