A man who was allegedly involved in a fiery car crash on a busy freeway and then carjacked the good Samaritan who stopped to help has been caught by police.

The 30-year-old driver was spotted walking through traffic erratically after allegedly crashing his green Nissan patrol into a light pole on the Mitchell Freeway in Perth at 5am on Friday.

A construction worker, who only wanted to be known as Chad, was still wiping the sleep from his eyes when he saw the car explode into flames.

The 35-year-old was one of several people to stop and try to help the driver.

But while they were helping him and directing traffic, the man got into Chad's white Rodeo truck with the keys still in it and drove off. 

Chad described the man who stole the uninsured ute as a 'low life'.

'I wouldn't mind going a couple of rounds with him,' he said. 

The car explosed into flames after crashing into the light pole and caused major peak hour delays
