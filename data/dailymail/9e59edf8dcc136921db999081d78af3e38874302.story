World indoor bronze medallist Andrew Osagie saw his hopes of a 800m Commonwealth Games medal ended by a disqualification after tangling with Wales' Joe Thomas just before they crossed the line on Tuesday.

The pair exchanged cross words after finishing, Osagie coming home in third and Thomas, in fourth, but the Welshman was bumped up a place after the officials took exception to his rival's actions and qualified for the semi-finals.

England have appealed against the disqualification and Osagie, who did appear to block Thomas off down the inside, said he did nothing wrong.

The Essex athlete said: 'There was a scuffle, there were people looking for gaps that weren't there. At that sort of pace, everyone comes into play.

'I would say it was not his space, you can always go round people. If you don't you will cause a collision. That happened to me at the trials and somebody clipped my hamstring, and that has affected me coming into these championships.'

Elsewhere, David Rudisha, whose 800m Olympic gold and world record in London provided one of the highlights of those Games, treated Hampden to a dominant qualifying run.

The Kenyan, back after injury ruled him out of the 2013 World Championships, produced a customary display of front-running to win his heat in one minute and 46.89 secs.

England's John Lane lay third and Ashley Bryant fourth after seven events of the decathlon, while, in the absence of Ennis-Hill and Katarina Johnson-Thompson, Jessica Taylor lay third after two events of the heptathlon.

Upset: Osagie took to Twitter to vent his anger at the decision

Your fault: The English 800m runner wasn't happy with training partner
