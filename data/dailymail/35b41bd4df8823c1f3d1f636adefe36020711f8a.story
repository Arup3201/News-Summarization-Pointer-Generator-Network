Two Colorado parents have taken their 12 children out of school in order to roam the country while living in an RV.

Dan and Susie Kellogg decided to cram their kids- who vary in age between three-months and 19-years-old- into a camper after selling their Glenwood Springs, Colorado house.

Inspired by a two-month test vacation last summer during which they visited 22 states and indulged their family wide love of kayaking, the Kellogg's are committed to proving that you do not need to be tied down in order to have a fulfilling existence.

Indeed, Susie, Dan, Kerry, 19, Grady, 16, Brody, 15, Kady, 14, Kenny, 12, Dally, 10, Cardy, 9, Maddy, 7, Rowdy, 5, Emmy, 4, Ellie, 3 and new-born Coby see themselves as a modern day wagon trail moving away from civilization.

'Is that crazy? Are we crazy? We have to be a little bit, right?' said Susie to The Denver Post.

No longer slaves to car pools and their work cubicles, the Kellogg family plan to home school their kids using the Internet out of the RV and enter kayak events on rivers and streams all over - no matter the weather.

'We will be a bit cramped, but we will stop at laundromats to do the wash … they offer six machines in a row … so we can get it done in no time,' said mom, Susie Kellogg to Fox News.

'We give up things such as going to the bathroom anytime we want to go, but we do take ‘R&R’ stops at hotels and motels.'

Despite only giving birth to baby Coby in November, Dan and Susie are more than ready they claim to spend each and every day together as a family.

While Dan continues to work as a software engineer remotely, the Kellogg family financial future is a main consideration for leaving the rat race behind.

'We wanted to get rid of the mortgage,' said Susie to the Today Show.

'Get rid of the car payments and breathe.'

Each child was only allowed to bring two of their favourite items - meaning that one Kellogg's kid couldn't bring their favourite trampoline with them.

'It's amazing when you realize how many things you don't really need,' says Dan.

'We are simplifying our life. It's liberating.'

Mom Susie and dad Dan have decided to give their children a different life to those of normal children and encourage outdoor pursuits

On the Open Road: The Kellogg family became committed to a life on the freeways after a two-month test vacation last summer during which they visited 22 states

Kerry, 19, Grady, 16, Brody, 15, Kady, 14, Kenny, 12, Dally, 10, Cardy, 9, Maddy, 7, Rowdy, 5, Emmy, 4, Ellie, 3 and new-born Coby see themselves as a modern day wagon trail away from civilization

The Kelloggs claim to have set off for the same reason the pioneers did:  Freedom -- from ordinary lives.

'This is what freedom is,' Dan said, waving his hand at the open road. 'You go after it.'

Last summer, the family spent two months testing the waters of the RV life, touring 22 states and competing in nearly every junior kayaking competition in the country.

'Everything we have done comes from wanting to be free,' said Susie to The Denver Post.

'I think we were sold when we got back to Glenwood and every single one of us was a little bummed to be coming home,' explains Dan.

The Kellogg's have put no time limit on their experiment and have sold their home of nearly a decade in Colorado to finance their lifestyle

The Kellogg's want their children to be free.

'I want them to live life in the moment and not be living for tomorrow or ‘After my kids are grown,’ or ‘Thank God it’s Friday.’ said Susie to Today.

'Every single day is a weekend.'
