AFC Wimbledon striker Adebayo Akinfenwa has posted a picture of an industrial sized tank on his Instagram. Oh and there’s an old army vehicle in there somewhere as well.

Akinfenwa captioned the photo: ‘Sometimes it's kool to hang out with ppl dat u have the same interest.'

Pictured in his own brand clothing range, ‘Beast Mode On’, Akinfenwa flexes his muscles as he poses with the military tank.

The 32-year-old is known for his heavy build and physical strength, and according to top selling video game franchise FIFA - is the strongest player in the world.

Akinfenwa has 11 goals in 32 games so far this season for the League Two outfit, most notably scoring the equaliser in their narrow FA Cup third round defeat against Liverpool earlier this month.

The 16 stone forward is a big hit with the Wimbledon faithful - scoring an impressive 11 goals already this term

The 16 stone forward can impressively bench press 180kg, almost double the striker’s body weight.

The ‘Beast’ also sent a warning to Chelsea forward Diego Costa on Instagram on Wednesday night, over the Chelsea striker’s treatment of Akinfenwa’s self-confessed hero Steven Gerrard.

Accompanied by pictures of Costa and Gerrard playing against each other in the Capital One Cup semi-final Akinfenwa wrote: ‘Be careful #DiegoCosta bcuz #Adebayo #Akinfenwa will come for you. #LiverpoolFC #LFC #YNWA #GERARRD.’
