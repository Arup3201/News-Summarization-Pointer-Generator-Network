Mark Hughes and Sir Alex Ferguson never saw eye to eye during their spell together at Manchester United, however the Stoke boss turned to his former manager for reassurance that sparked his management career back into life.

Hughes, who takes his Stoke side to Blackburn where his management career began on Saturday in the FA Cup fifth-round, endured a turbulent spell in charge of free-spending Queens Park Rangers before being sacked in 2012 after just 11 months in charge.

As a result Hughes turned to Ferguson, who he played under between 1988-95 at Old Trafford, and points to a 90 minute chat with the Scot that reinvigorated his desire to take charge of a side again.

‘As a player I didn’t ask too much of Sir Alex, really. I didn’t need to have a relationship with him to be honest,’ Hughes told the Sun.

‘I talked to him just before he retired. I went to see him after the QPR thing just because I had never done it before. I asked his advice, we talked football. I thought it was something I would regret If I didn’t do it because I was never the kind of player that would knock on his door and say “Can I have a word, boss?”’

Hughes was grateful Ferguson gave him so much time and hailed it as a turning point: ‘Sometimes you just need a bit of reassurance,’ added Hughes. ‘

'He assured me in terms of where my standing was in the game and that was good, he’s a huge influence. It was something I needed to do and I’m glad I did it.’
