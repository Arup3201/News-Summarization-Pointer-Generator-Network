Paintings' re-emergence coincides with planned auction of other expedition memorabilia, including Scott's last letter

The evocative ‘lost’ paintings produced by a polar explorer who later perished alongside Captain Scott on his doomed expedition to the South Pole have emerged 100 years on.

Dr Edward Wilson sketched the unforgiving landscapes of Antarctica while the party spent months waiting at base camp before they could set off for the Pole.

The artist was unable to use his watercolour paints outdoors as they would have frozen in the bone-chilling temperatures of -70F.

Instead he made pencilled notes about what colours to use on the drawings and then painted them in the comparative warmth of their base hut at Cape Evans.

The paintings produced from April to June 1911 show a snow-covered wilderness shrouded in darkness that only a handful of men had visited before.

One, painted from a hilltop, shows a desolate snowy scene with two tiny figures from the expedition team walking along the sea ice.

Other paintings are of two explorers exercising ponies they took with them and a handful of men heaving sledges across the ice.

There is a painting of Henry ‘Birdie’ Bowers checking a thermometer under moonlight. He also went on to die on the ill-fated Terra Nova mission.

Another illustration shows a cluster of Emperor Penguins at an ice barrier at Cape Crozier that Dr Wilson spent six weeks travelling to in order to gather rare eggs.

The 17 paintings were recovered from the base hut and published in Scott’s Last Expedition Diaries in 1913, the last time they were assembled together.

Only one or two were printed in later editions of the book.

Nine of the original paintings were donated by Dr Wilson’s family to a museum in Cumbria, but they have only recently gone on display for the first time.

The 17 images have now been printed in their entirety in a new edition of Scott’s diaries.

Dr Peter Lloyd Jones, chairman of the Captain Scott Society, said: ‘Wilson was a tremendous graphic artist and was considered to be the perfect person to send on the mission.

‘As an illustrator to the expedition and is one of the best artists to have ever gone to Antarctica.

‘He produced some very evocative images under very difficult circumstances. They are pensive and thoughtful images, not incredibly exciting but very reflective.’

Dr Lloyd Jones added that the pictures have not been distributed widely and until now have been seen by very few people.

While the photographs taken on the expedition have become increasingly accessible, the sketches have not, he said.

After seeing out the austral winter of 1911, Captain Scott’s ‘Polar Party’ of 16 men set off in the November to be the first people to reach the South Pole.

The supporting party of 11 men returned as planned at various stages during the 800 mile trek, leaving Captain Scott, Dr Wilson, Captain Lawrence Oates, Petty Office Edger Evans and Lt Bowers.

The men made it to the South Pole on January 17, 1912 only to find Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen had beaten them to it a month before.

On their return journey, the five men endured dreadful conditions and suffered from a lack of food and frostbite.

PO Evans died on February 17 and a flagging Captain Oates famously died on March 16 after walking out of the tent into a blizzard to give the remaining three a chance of survival.

Captain Scott, Dr Wilson and Lt Bowers died in the tent on or about March 29. Their bodies were found eight months later by a rescue party.

Meanwhile as the prints have been reprinted, the centenary of Scott's journey is also being marked by a Polar Sale at Bonhams, which will see items from the voyage and other commemorative pieces go under the hammer.

Scott's final letter, written to Sir Edgar Speyer includes the line  'We have seen the Pole and we shall die like gentlemen'. It was found eight months later by a search party and forms part of the sale to be held on March 30.

A collection of Dunn Bennett bone china from the ward room of the Terra Nova expedition ship will also go on sale, as well as a watch inscribed to Peter Scott in memory of his late father Captain Scott.
