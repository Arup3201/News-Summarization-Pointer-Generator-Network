An animal rights organisation has released undercover video footage of a Canadian veal farm which appears to show calves being forced into small pens, beaten and left to suffer.

Mercy For Animals Canada captured the shocking footage over an eight week period at a veal factory farm in Quebec.

The footage appears to show the young animals being forced into tiny crates, in which they are unable to turn around, as well as being punched and kicked.

Undercover footage which appears to show calves being forced into small pens and beaten at a Canadian veal factory farm has been released by an animals rights organisation

The footage appears to show the animals being abused at the site in Quebec

The footage, taken over an eight week period, appears to show the animals being kicked and punched

The group also claims sick and injured animals were left to suffer in the crates without proper veterinary care.

In one shocking scene, a calf appears to be shot by a rifle. The injured animal however does not die immediately and has to be shot for a second time.

The undercover investigation, which took place between December 2013 and February 2014, has now prompted an investigation by Montreal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, CTV News has reported.

Krista Osborne, of Mercy For Animals Canada, said: 'Their short lives are filled with fear, violence and prolonged suffering.'

Dr. John Webster, Professor of Animal Husbandry at the University of Bristol, and Europe's leading expert on dairy cattle welfare, said: 'In all my experience, this is the worst, cruellest system that I have ever seen, in every sense, housing, health and stockmanship.

'[T]he system as seen on the video is now
 illegal in Europe, both in regard to individual housing, and denial of 
access to solid feed containing sufficient digestible fibre.'

The footage shows the calves crammed into tiny pens, in which they are even unable to turn around

The footage has also been shown to Fabien
 Fontaine, a member of the Quebec Veal Association and the owner of 
Delimax Veal, it has been reported.

Delimax delivers the calves to the barn before picking them up to take to the slaughter house and also delivers the milk by-products the calves are fed.

Fontaine told CTV W5 that Delimax does not own the operation and described the video as 'sickening and unacceptable.'

He also said he had not been aware of any mistreatment of calves at the site and said the future for milk-fed calves in Quebec would soon be more humane.

He took a news team to another operation where calves were raised in group pens, had more room to move and were occasionally fed grain and corn as a treat.

Andre Blais, Delimax's head of development and commercialization, said the farm was not owned by his company.

Mercy For Animals Canada claims sick and injured animals were left to suffer in the crates without proper veterinary care

Veal crates were made illegal in the UK in 1990 and banned by the European Union in 2007

He told QMI Agency: 'They're not our animals. The people who raise them don't work for us.They are a client, and we sell their services.'

Twyla Francois, Mercy For Animals's director of investigations in Canada, told The Huffington Post: 'The Canadian veal industry treats baby calves like mere meat-producing machines. Their short lives are filled with misery, violence, and deprivation.'

Mercy For Animals is now calling on the Retail Council of Canada to prohibit veal crates in its members grocers' supply chains.

Veal crates were made illegal in the UK in 1990 and banned by the European Union in 2007.

A number of U.S. states have also banned crates. The American Veal Association wants them eliminated completely by 2017.
