Florida authorities are on the hunt for a 6-foot-long alligator after it attacked a canoeing woman and bit into her leg.

Andrea Reese, 20, of Uniontown, Ohio, was attacked seemingly without provocation Thursday and though she declined interviews hospital staff at Tampa General say she is in good condition.

A search is now on for the animal which authorities say must be put down as it has proven itself a danger.

Authorities say that although the attack appears to have been without cause they must now euthanize the alligator (not pictured)

The Tampa Bay Times reports the woman had no food, small animals, or anything else that could attract an alligator.

She sustained bites to her left thigh and calf.

One other woman in the canoe, Morgan Fusselman, 20, was not injured.

The women rented the canoe from Canoe Escape on the 23-acre park of Lower Hillsborough Wilderness Preserve and had been boating about 45 minutes downriver when the attack occurred.

'It's the last thing you want to hear. You know it's a possibility, 
but the probability is just not there,' Canoe Escape manager Michael Cole told The Tampa Bay Times. 'But in the outdoors, 
anything is possible and freakish accidents can occur.'

Cole said himself and three paramedics took three canoes to travel out to the women and transport them back to safety and medical attention.

Warning signs were posted throughout the area that alligators were present

Cole, 23, said such an incident had not occurred in at least two decades.

Vernon Yates, director of Wildlife Rescue & Rehabilitation in Seminole, said it's possible someone could bump into an alligator in the water without seeing it.

'You don't know what happened to the alligator five minutes before she came up on it,'Â  he said.

However trappers are now attempting to euthanize the animal.

"It's uncommon, specifically because as we know so far it was 
unprovoked," Baryl Martin, spokesman for the Florida Wildlife and 
Conservation Commission, told USA Today.
