Rebellion: Jenny Winder, left, head teacher at Elstow School near Bedford, has now cancelled a Caribbean holiday she booked during term time

A head teacher branded a 'hypocrite' after she booked a Caribbean holiday for during term time has today caved in to pressure from parents and cancelled it.

Jenny Winder, 53, head of Elstow Primary School near Bedford, had wanted a week off after the Christmas holidays ended for an exotic beach break.

This was despite it being after the start of school term and parents being told in no uncertain terms that they cannot take their children out of lessons.

Today Bedford Borough Council confirmed Mrs Winder has 'cancelled the proposed leave and will be in work from the start of the new spring term on the January 5, 2015'.

Earlier today parent governor Reverend Jeremy Crocker called on Mrs Winder to cancel her holiday and apologise because her proposed holiday was blatant 'double standards'.

He also said she sent a letter to parents falsely claiming her holiday was 'unanimously' backed by governors like him.

Her school, which she has run for 14 years, warns had parents who take their children out of school during term time facing fines of £60 per child for unauthorised absences. 

Mrs Winder had refused to give an explanation or apologise for trying to take the time off.

She said: 'My private life is exactly what it says - private.'

Her holiday was approved as 'appropriate' by a sub-committee of the school's governors and chairman Kevin Hunter said Mrs Winder was 'devoted' and 'well-liked'.  

But parent governor Reverend Crocker said the sub-committee was presented with the decision as though it had already been made.

He said he raised it with Mr Hunter because he had 'misgivings about the double-standard of a head teacher taking a holiday in term-time'.

He added that Mrs Winder sent a letter to parents saying the vote to allow her to take the holiday was 'unanimous' despite this being untrue.

Rev Crocker, who is rector at three local churches, said he wanted to clarify his own position and said Mrs Winter should apologise to staff and parents and cancel her holiday.

He said: 'I hold the view that the chair of governors should resign, Mrs Winder should apologise to both the staff and parents and she should not go on the holiday.' 

Complaint: Local vicar and governor Reverend Jeremy Crocker said that the head should say sorry and cancel her holiday - and also claims a letter she sent to parents about the issue was untrue

In its last Ofsted inspection in 2009, Elstow School was rated as outstanding and Mrs Winder is thought to be paid around £45,000 a year.

The website for the school, which caters for four to 11-year-olds reminds parents  to book breaks 'only in holiday time' and encourages pupils to achieve 'highest possible levels of attendance'.

It adds that the school 'will not authorise' such absences and parents are fined £60 per parent per child per period of absence, which rises to £120 if not paid within 21 days.

On her Friends Reunited page, the head describes herself as a former PE teacher now ‘too old, fat and unfit’ to teach the subject so has become a head instead.

The mother-of-one, who is separated from her son’s father, is understood to be travelling to the Caribbean, where average daytime temperatures in January are around 28C, with her partner. 

However, one parent of children at the school said: 'Mrs Winder is taking a week off in the New Year after the children have gone back. 

Some parents, whose children attend the school, pictured, have branded Mrs Winder 'a hypocrite' for booking the holiday 

'This is so unfair as teachers already get so many holidays and yet we wouldn't be allowed to take our children out of school for even a day.' 

Parents who have branded Mrs Winder a 'hypocrite' for taking a holiday during school time have pointed to new measures, which mean they can be fined for taking their children on a term-time holiday.

Previously, head teachers had the discretion to allow pupils up to 10 days of leave from school each year.

However, under new measures brought in by former Education Secretary Michael Gove, children can only be taken out of school in 'exceptional circumstances'.

Parents who take their children out of school without authorisation, they can face a fine of £60 for every child.

Those who refuse to pay can be prosecuted, fined £2,500 and even face jail.

In the Bedford Borough Council area, where Elstow School is located, 432 parents were issued with a fixed penalty notice for taking their children out of school, when their absence was not authorised between September 2013 and July 2014.

This compares to just 39 fixed penalty notices, which were issued between September 2012 and July 2013.  

Earlier this year, one of the first couples to be prosecuted for taking their family on holiday during term time were Stewart and Natasha Sutherland from Shropshire.

The couple took their three children Keane, six, Sian, 13, and Rhiannan, 15, to the Greek island of Rhodes last September.

Mr Sutherland, who works for the Ministry of Defence Guard Service said at the time that it was the first family holiday in five years as the couple had struggled to get time off work together. 

After refusing to pay the fines, they were prosecuted at Telford Magistrates Court and fined £630.

Speaking at the time Mr Sutherland said: 'I know education is important but there's a bigger picture. Family time is important too.'

It has been estimated that more than 24,000 children skip school every day to go on family holidays as parents ignore the threat of fines to escape peak-time price hikes.
