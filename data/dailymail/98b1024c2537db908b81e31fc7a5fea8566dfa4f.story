The latest Doctor Who series kicks off tonight, with fans of the show holding their breath for Peter Capaldi’s debut as the twelfth incarnation of the eponymous hero. 

And a café in Bristol has decided to honour the popular BBC show in a very unique way.

The Time Lord's famous blue box has been converted into a toilet for the café's customers, complete with flashing lights and Tardis sound effects.

The cafe's owners bought the replica Tardis for £1,800 on eBay and paid to have it fitted out as a toilet

Owner Claire Hoggans says customers are constantly asking whether the 'Who Loo' is bigger on the inside

The café's owners Justin and Claire Hoggans picked up the replica for £1,800 on eBay and spent almost as much again getting it fitted out by a carpenter in York. 

And since installing the ‘Who Loo’, as they have called it, the Hoggans have had a steady stream of visitors to their Warmley Waiting Room Cafe on the Bristol & Bath Railway Path.

The Tardis has been fitted with a Victorian-style toilet and sink, along with a hand dryer, tiled floor and walls and a new fibreglass roof.

It also features Tardis sound effects, which are operated via a doorbell in the café, and flashing lights that are operated by a motion sensor as people go in and out to spend a penny.

The Tardis is set to become a tourist attraction in the area, with customers lining up to have their photograph taken in front of the unique toilet.

Claire, 47, said: ‘We enjoy Doctor Who but we are not crazy, Trekkie-type people.’

Justin, 41, added: ‘We've always loved Doctor Who and we went to a B&B that had a Tardis as a changing room for their hot tub, which our kids loved.

‘This gave me the idea. Lots of people, young and old seem to love it - it's a talking point and a bit of fun, but also functional.

‘We get asked numerous times a day 'is it bigger on the inside?’’

Debut: Peter Capaldi is set to star in his first full episode as the Time Lord in Deep Breath tonight, which will see him transported to Victorian London where a dinosaur is running rampant

Doctor Who returns to BBC One tonight at 7.50pm with Peter Capaldi as the twelfth Doctor.

It was first screened in 1963 and has since gained cult status with 800 episodes produced.

'Tardis' stands for Time and Relative Dimensions in Space.

The official BBC Tardis materialised in London's Parliament Square yesterday as the stars of the show posed for publicity photographs ahead of tonight’s launch.

Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman, who plays the Doctor’s assistant Clara Oswald, perched on a rock side next to a giant dinosaur skull.

Peter, 56, stars in his first full episode as the Time Lord in Deep Breath tonight, which will see the Doctor transported to Victorian London where a dinosaur is running rampant.
