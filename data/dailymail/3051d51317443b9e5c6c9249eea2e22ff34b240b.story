Detroit Lions' star wide receiver Calvin Johnson is slowly returning to full fitness ahead of Sunday’s game against Atlanta Falcons, but still has a long way to go before being passed fit for the Wembley showpiece.

Johnson has been watching from the sidelines since injuring his ankle during Detroit’s week-five defeat by Buffalo Bills, but travelled with the team to England on Tuesday with a view to making a comeback against the Falcons.

‘He was limited (in practice on Wednesday),’ head coach Jim Caldwell said at the team’s Pennyhill Park base on Thursday.

‘He did what the doctors allowed him to do. Typically, when they ramp up their activity that way, the most important thing is how they feel the next day.

‘Today he came back feeling good and that’s encouraging.’

Johnson did not suffer any adverse reaction after being put through his paces in two practice sessions

Johnson practised again on Thursday at Lions HQ in Bagshot, and looked to be moving more freely.

Before practice, Johnson said: ‘We are moving in a positive direction. Right now it is getting better on a daily basis.

‘We are doing everything from straightforward running to moving laterally as well and things are going good.’

Johnson still hopes to step out in front of 84,000 fans at Wembley Stadium on Sunday

The 29-year-old is prepared to wait until Sunday before being given the all clear to play in front of 84,000 fans at Wembley in the latest International Series fixture.

‘It might go all the way to Sunday,’ he said. ‘I want to push it, but we’re trying to be smart about it and taking good advice from our training staff.’
