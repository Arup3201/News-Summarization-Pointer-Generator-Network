French designer Roland Mouret might think the 'Kate effect' is nothing to the 'Kim effect', but that hasn't stopped eco-label Beulah from reissuing the pale blue chiffon dress the Duchess of Cambridge sported on tour in the Far East.

The Duchess, who turned 31 on Wednesday, wore the £540 dress to visit Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur's Assyakirin Mosque in September - sparking a stampede among fashion fans.

Beulah designer Lady Natasha Rufus Isaacs is an old friend of the Duchess - and is engaged to her ex-boyfriend Rupert Finch.

According to the Grazia website, the relaunched dress will be sold exclusively at Harvey Nichols.

But Beulah aren't the only designers to reissue pieces in order to capitalise on the Kate effect.

Kate's cream silk Whistles engagement blouse was relaunched after selling out, as were her black LK. Bennett espadrille wedges.

More recently, designer Rebecca Taylor reissued a blue tweed skirt suit after the Duchess was seen wearing it at a charity event in May.

Missoni also re-released a blue tweed coat, part of diffusion line M Missoni, that was snapped up two years after it first hit the catwalk by the thrifty Duchess at discount outlet Bicester Village.

Although the Duchess was lucky enough to get hers for less, copy-Kates had to pay the full price of £670 when the piece went on sale again at the M Missoni flagship store in London.

But despite Kate's star power, not 
everyone is convinced by the 'Kate effect', with French designer, Roland
Mouret, saying that reality star Kim Kardashian sells more clothes.

'You don’t see hundreds of women running around looking like her [Kate Middleton],' he told the Telegraph newspaper.

'To be honest, we’re more likely to get orders on a dress that Kim Kardashian’s worn.'

He added: 'She’s highly attuned to those details that will provoke a tabloid frenzy and above all, she does not want a tabloid frenzy.

'She doesn’t seem to feel the need to dress sexily to woo the world. She’s dressing for William and herself.'

Whistles CEO Jane Shepherd also questioned Kate's ability to sell clothes - despite being the brains behind one of the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite brands.

'It raises our profile, it’s great, we get known in countries we’re not known in,' she told Grazia magazine.

'But it’s not going to turn us into a success overnight because she wears it. Fortunately, she looks great in it and it’s a great advert, but no more than that.'

Sold out: This emerald green Mulberry dress sparked a shopping frenzy after the Duchess of Cambridge wore it to an event at the Natural History Museum. The Christopher Kane coat-dress (right) worn to the Olympics Opening Ceremony proved similarly popular
