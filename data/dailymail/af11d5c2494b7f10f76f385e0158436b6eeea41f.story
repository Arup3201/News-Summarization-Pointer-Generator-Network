The 19-year-old college student accused of poisoning her roommate’s iced tea with bleach has been arrested again for allegedly making contact with the young woman at a bar.

Kayla A. Bonkowski, 19, who was charged with a felony last November for allegedly spiking her roommate’s drink, had her bond revoked after showing up at a bar in Wayside Central, Michigan and making her alleged victim feel uncomfortable.

Bonkowski’s $20,000 bond is now revoked and she is back in jail.

Prosecutors allege that Bonkowski was at Wayside Central Bar and was staring at her alleged victim, Emily Joseph.

They added that the Central Michigan 
University student violated the two conditions of her bond, which were 
not to make any contact with her former roommate, and not to enter a 
drinking establishment, MLive.com reported.

The poisoning occurred on November 7 at the students' apartment in Union Township, located near
the Mount Pleasant school of Central Michigan University, authorities said.

Miss Joseph was taken to hospital for treatment but later released. After she filed a complaint, Bonkowski was arrested.

The 19-year-old 'verbally admitted' to police that she put bleach in the drink because 'Joseph is mean', according to ABC.

The college student faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
