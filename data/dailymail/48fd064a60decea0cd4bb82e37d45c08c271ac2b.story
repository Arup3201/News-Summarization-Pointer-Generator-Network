Katie Tuite, 23, watched all the tragic drama of a high-speed pursuit involving an allegedly stolen Audi and police cars from the passenger seat but was not charged over the chase which led to the death of toddler Tatalena Tauaifaga.

The female passenger faced court on a raft of unrelated offences just hours before the alleged driver was arrested. 

Christopher Chandler, was arrested by police at a home in Gorokan on the Central Coast on Wednesday afternoon at 4.50pm.

Police believe that he was driving a stolen Audi during the police chase which ended horribly wrong, after 17-month-old Tatalena Tauai-fage was struck and killed by a vehicle while playing in the backyard of her Constitution Hill home last Thursday.

Chandler has been taken to Wyong Police Station to assist police with their investigations and is expected to charged with car theft.

Investigations are ongoing to determine if the Audi or the police vehicle were responsible the baby’s fatal injuries.

Whilst Chandler has remained on the run, his passenger Tuite was arrested on the day of the toddler's tragic death.  

She was remanded in Darlinghurst, in possession of drugs methyl-amphetamine (ice) and buprenorphine, near where Chandler, 22, had dumped the Audi.

Magistrate Les Mabbutt refused her bail application after hearing of Tuite's own reign of terror.

 Police prosecutors detailing her own personal crime spree over the past 18 months; including offences ranging from aggravated robbery, serious assault, stealing, possession of housebreaking equipment and providing police with more than 20 false names and information.

Her distraught family have reached out to Tuite, assuring her that they still love her and are devastated by the problems that drugs have allegedly brought into her life.

Katie’s sister-in-law Samantha said they know there is still a chance the 23-year-old can turn her life around. 

We didn’t want it to be like this, we want her to change her life and start doing good,' she told Nine.

'We all know that she’s got the potential to do it.'

Tuile's mother also cried when explaining how devastated she feels after the tragic death of baby Tatalena.  

‘I’m so sorry… I wake up in the morning and see those baby’s eyes in my eyes.' 

Tuite, sporting Asian symbol tattoos on her arms and prison greens, appeared by video link from inside Silverwater Jail, where she will remain until her next court appearance, set down for January 29 

Police prosecutors claimed 'the defendant's record extends over the last 18 months from August 29 last year and since there have been continuous offences. (She) continues to make choices with further undesirable people'.

Magistrate Mabbutt said: 'The range of the offences are grave matters, the accused has a length history and has outstanding matters, the offences overall have to be considered serious.

'The accused has a history of violence,' he stated, adding that they would most likely like to 'full-time custody'.

Detectives working on the Constitution Hill case have received vital information as to the whereabouts of Christopher Chandler who was allegedly behind the wheel of a stolen Audi which eluded police last week

Meantime, it's believed senior detectives have received information about Chandler's recent movements, a police source revealing that they are confident of an imminent arrest.

The manhunt has not only focused on premises he's known to have visited across Sydney's west but also beyond, amid fears he may have fled interstate. He has been on the run since leading five police vehicles on a wild chase through the streets of Constitution Hill.

Police would make no official comment on the manhunt except to say 'investigations are continuing to try and locate him'.

Friends lay flowers outside the family home of 17-month-old Tatalena, who was killed as she played with two of her sisters in the usually quite cul-de-sac of Bessbrook Way last Thursday

17-month-old Tatalena was killed as she played with two of her sisters in the usually quiet cul-de-sac of Bessbrook Way.

Forensic analysis is yet to determine whether it was the stolen vehicle or a police car which struck the toddler.

Chandler is accused of crashing the car through two fences at the end of Bessbrook Way, and through a backyard, as he tried to elude authorities before speeding through a park where up to 15 children, including several of Tatalena's eight siblings were playing cricket with friends, just moments earlier.

He is believed to have then driven through surrounding suburbs, avoiding detection before ditching the Audi in the city's east, running off and leaving his passenger behind. She was arrested by Kings Cross Police and charged with drugs offences.

Chandler is believed to have been wanted for questioning over a spate of armed robberies and it's been reported police were in fact monitoring his movements on the day of the pursuit, fearing he was set to strike again.

Neighbours have revealed that police were spotted searching at least one home where one of Chandler's friends lived in Constitution Hill, in the days after the fatal pursuit.

Locals said Chandler had grown up in the community with his brother and mother but had lived elsewhere in recent years.

Police have urged the public not to approach Chandler if they see him.
