A row has broken out after Ryanair pilots accused the airline of putting cost-cutting ahead of passenger safety by forcing crews to fly with limited fuel in order to save money.

Speaking anonymously on a Dutch television programme, four pilots said they often found themselves on the brink of making distress calls during flights because their planes were so low on fuel.

But Ryanair has strenuously denied the pilots' claims that they are under pressure from management to carry as little fuel as is legally allowed to help keep costs down.

The pilots said on the programme that the 'stress' of the situation was affecting their decision-making while at the helm of 
passenger jets.

When asked by Dutch television programme KRO Reporter if he ever felt pressure to take less fuel on a journey than he would like, one unidentified pilot replied: 'You feel it everyday.'

Another explained that the less weight a plane carries, the less fuel it burns, making flights more cost efficient.

Former Ryanair pilot Ian Somner, who also appeared on the programme, described an 'oppressive regime' at the airline where he said staff were 'bullied' by management.

The claims emerged after the airline was told to carry out a review of its fuel policy in September when three of its planes were forced to make emergency landings in Spain on one day when they started to run out.

But the airline told the MailOnline today that the claims, published in the Sun newspaper, were 'false rubbish'.

A spokesman said: 'These claims have no validity and originate from a Dutch TV programme which featured anonymous contributors in darkened rooms.Â 

'The reason these anonymous contributors did not want their identities revealed is because there was no truth to their claims.'

Ryanair said all its pilots were allowed to take as much fuel as they wished to take, which in all cases was more than the minimum reserve amount.

The spokesman added that Ryanair was issuing defamation proceedings against the Sun in the wake of its article.
