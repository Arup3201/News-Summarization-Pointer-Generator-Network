Attorney Gloria Allred today challenged Bill Cosby to pay $100 million in damages to the women who claim he sexually assaulted them.

The lawyer introduced three alleged victims - two who have never spoken before - and as they broke down in tears, she told Cosby he could waive the statute of limitations so all the women accusing him of assault could have their day in court.

If not, she said, he could stump up $100 million - and the money would be handed out to the women by a committee of retired judges.

Options:  Gloria Allred says Cosby can either stump up $100m to his alleged victims - or waive the statute of limitations so they can have their day in court

Speaking at her California law offices, Miss Allred said she had been forced to tell many women who had contacted her to report abuse at the hands of the comic legend that they were too late to file a lawsuit due to the statute of limitations.

However, she said: 'Today, I am here to propose two new solutions to this public dilemma and a away to determine if Bill Cosby is a saint of a sexual predator.'

She said that if Cosby, now 77, is 'confident' he has done nothing wrong, he could waive the statute of limitations, adding: 'Then his alleged victims would have an opportunity to have their allegations dealt with on their merits.

'Bill Cosby would have an opportunity to address there allegations in a court of law and the victims and Mr Cosby would have an opportunity to have a judge and jury decide who should be believed.'

This would be similar, Miss Allred said, to the Catholic Church cases in California, which involved allegations of sexual abuse by priests.  A law allowed victims to sue within a one year period.

Alternatively, Miss Allred said, if Cosby did not want to waive the statute of limitations, he could pour $100 million into a fund, adding that anyone who claims to be a victim could put their case in front of a panel of retired judges, who would act as arbitrators, who would then decided if their case had merit - and how much damages they would be awarded.

Cosby has an estimated fortune of $400 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. He has made his fortune through numerous endorsements including Jell-O, Coca-Cola and Ford - and dominating TV in the 1980s with The Cosby Show. 

Cosby’s syndication deal in 1988 also earned him a fortune. Rights to air The Cosby Show for three years were sold to Fox for $550 million.

He currently lives with his wife of 51 years, Camille, in a compound in Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts, that includes two large farmhouses. They couple moved in in 1971 and also bought several acres around the town for conservation purposes.

However, Miss Allred said: 'It's time for justice and accountability and we challenge him to end this nightmare, both for him and the alleged victims by accepting either of the options that I proposed and we look forward to his response.' 

Chelan Lasha, from California - now believed to be a 46-year-old Grandmother - told how Cosby attacked her when she was just 17 in 1986 when she was an aspiring model.

Weeping, she said her stepmother had sent pictures of her to the star and he called her at home in Las Vegas, inviting her to the Hilton Las Vegas, where he was performing and she had a job.

She then went up to Elvis Presley suite to meet him and after telling him she had a cold, he gave her a blue pill, which he said was an antihistimine, with a double shot of Amaretto.

She said: 'He was rubbing my neck and saying that he might have to have someone come in and give me stress therapy.'

She claimed he told her to change into a Hilton bathrobe and wet her hair to see the modelling scout. 

Someone did briefly come up to the room, pertaining to be from the Ford Modelling Agency -telling her to she needed to lose 10 pounds - and taking some pictures.

Then, Chelan said, Cosby walked her to the bedroom and gave her another shot of Amaretto, which he claimed would help her cold. 

'I laid down,' she said: 'He laid down next to me on the bed and began pinching my left nipple and humping my leg while he was grunting.

'I could not open my eyes. I couldn't move or say anything. I felt something warm on my legs. Then I blacked out.' 

No comment: Bill Cosby today thanked Whoopi Goldberg and singer Jill Scott for their support on Twitter - but has made no public statement 

'Thirteen to sixteen hours later I woke up by hearing Mr Cosby clapping his hands and saying 'Daddy says wake up'. He gave me $1500. He said the money was to buy something nice for me and my grandmother and he also invited me to go to the Temptations show with my grandmother.

'My grandmother went but I did not go because I was too sick. Then he invited us to his show. My grandmother really want to go. I did not, but I went with her and heckled him. As a result, I was fired my from job.'  

Chelan was joined by two other women, Helen Hayes, who claims Cosby fondled her breast after stalking her and her friends 'like a predator' after they met in the summer of 1973.

Beth Ferrier, meanwhile, who has already come forward, alleges that she had an affair with Cosby, which ended in him drugging and raping her - and leaving her to come to in her car in an alleyway. 

She was Jane Doe 5 in the civil suit brought against Cosby by Andrea Costand, the first woman to allege he had attacked her, in 2005. Former basketball player Andrea ended up settling out of court.
