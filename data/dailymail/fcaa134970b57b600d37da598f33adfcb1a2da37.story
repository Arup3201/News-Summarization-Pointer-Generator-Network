Disgraced Alex Rodriguez reported for a New York Yankees pre-season training camp two days early and apologized for taking performance-enhancing drugs that led to him being banned for an entire season.

The 39-year-old slugger took his physical and worked out at the Yankees pre-season training complex in Florida, two days before the squad was due to report back.

His impromptu practice came three days ahead of the first scheduled team workout and he faced a flurry of media questions before the arrival of his team mates.

The 39-year-old is preparing for his comeback after being banned for an entire season as a result of taking performance-enhancing drugs 

His impromptu practice came three days ahead of the first scheduled team workout at the minor league facility in Tampa 

'A-Rod' was among more than a dozen players suspended last year as a result of the Biogensis clinic scandal, which saw steroids and human growth hormone distributed to players.

He received the longest ban, in part because of an attempt to impede a Major League Baseball investigation into the matter.

He told reporters at the camp in Tampa: 'Obviously it was a rough year. I'm excited that's behind me.

'Right now I'm just focused on making this team. I'm here early to get a jump start. I'm confident if I stay healthy I can do some good things.

Rodriguez shakes hands with some of the Yankees' coaches after finishing his batting practice. He missed the entire 2014 season due to a drugs ban 

'I made a mistake. I served a big penalty personally and professionally.

'I served the time. I tried to use the time productively. I paid my penalty. I'm moving on and focusing on 2015.

'There were plenty of mistakes in a lot of ways. I cringe sometimes when I look at the things I did. No mistake that I made has any good answer or justification.

'I've created a big headache for a lot of people so I don't blame whoever is mad at me.'

Rodriguez, a three-time American League Most Valuable Player, was originally given a 211-game ban but it was later reduced to 162 games, the entire 2014 campaign.

Rodriguez said the layoff might help his fitness by not putting his body through a season or risking injury.

When he went to enter the facility in Tampa, Florida, the sportsman was surrounded by fans and waiting reporters and photographers 

He told the media gathered at the training ground ''I made a mistake. I served a big penalty personally and professionally' 

He added: 'The time off has benefitted me. I feel healthy and ready to go.

'It's the first time I get a full year off and get to train instead of rehab.

'It's going to take some time for me. I haven't faced live pitching in a long time. It's one of the hardest things to do in sports. We'll see how it goes. I'm up for the challenge.'

Last week, Rodriguez issued an open letter of apology to fans, teammates, the Yankees and Major League Baseball for his actions as he begins to try and work his way back onto a team that he helped to a World Series crown in 2009.

The Yankees set to pay him $61 million over the next three seasons and manager Joe Girardi is expected to evaluate how well he can play at other fielding positions and designated hitter.

He added: 'I'm willing to try whatever Joe wants me to try. It's a process. It's going to take some time. I'm going to put in a lot of work.

'Winning a world championship. That's the best-case scenario. That's why we're all here.

'And the worst-case scenario? "Not winning a world championship.'

Although his achievements have been tainted by admissions of doping both recently and more than a decade ago for Texas, Rodriguez has 654 career home runs, six shy of Willie Mays for fourth on Major League Baseball's all-time homers list and 108 off the record 762 hit by Barry Bonds.
