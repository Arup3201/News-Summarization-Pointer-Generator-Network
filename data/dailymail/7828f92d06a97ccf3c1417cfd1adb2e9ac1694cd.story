In his first network interview since St. Louis County grand jury declined to indict Officer Darren Wilson for shooting and killing unarmed teenager Michael Brown, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said his department is 'misunderstood'. 

Jackson sat down with CBS News to discuss his police department, racial issues in Ferguson and the riots that occurred in the St. Louis suburb throughout the fall. 

'There is not a racial problem in the police department. We clearly have a racial divide that is perceived by a large part of the community,' Jackson said.

This was Jackson's first network interview since the St. Louis County grand jury declined to indict Officer Darren Wilson for shooting and killing unarmed teenager Michael Brown 

He added that there is no racial profiling happening in Ferguson.

'I challenge that anyone was harassed (by police). Racial profiling is not only prohibited, but it's illegal,' he said. 

Jackson went on to say that his officers have been under a lot of pressure since August, when Brown was shot dead.

'They've taken a lot of abuse. They've been assaulted quite a bit. I think it's taken its toll on them,' he said in the interview. 

Consultants have looked into the police department, Jackson said. Some were hired by the Department of Justice in order to look at work flow and staffing.

The police chief's hope is that Ferguson can have more officers on the streets and participating in community outreach.

He added that the force is recruiting African Americans and that more minority candidates have applied than had before it was announced Wilson would not be indicted. 

The police force was 'just overwhelmed' by the riots that occurred after the announcement and the force had no help from the National Guard during the first night of riots.

This interview comes after it was announced that the Department of Justice is expected not to charge Wilson for the shooting of Brown.

Justice Department officials are, however, planning to sue the Ferguson Police Department for racially discriminatory practices unless the department agrees to make changes, CNN reported.

The shooting of Brown became one of the focal points in the debate over unjust policing in the United States and led to a federal probe of both the incident and the Ferguson police department. 

The probe included Justice officials conducting a 'patterns and practices' investigation of the police department and a separate investigation to determine if Wilson violated Brown's civil rights.

After a St. Louis County grand jury decided not to indict and Missouri authorities concluded an investigation without recommending charges, the federal probe is the only remaining investigation probing whether to charge Wilson.

Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr did not provide a comment for the CNN report.

Attorney General Eric Holder said earlier this week at a National Press Club event he is 'confident' there will be a decision before the nominee to be his replacement, Loretta Lynch, is confirmed by the Senate.

Wilson resigned from the force in November, days after the grand jury announcement, which set off looting and fires that destroyed several businesses in and around Ferguson. 

The shooting months earlier had already spurred weeks of sometimes violent protests and a national debate over race relations and police use of force.

Less than a week before Holder's announcement, St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch vigorously defended his handling of the Ferguson police shooting during a law school lecture at his alma mater, ignoring protesters who repeatedly disrupted his speech.

Minutes after the lecture at a Saint Louis University academic symposium on policing began, an audience member wearing a judicial robe interrupted to accuse the elected prosecutor of misconduct for his office's role in the grand jury process that ended with Darren Wilson not being indicted.

Campus police escorted several protesters from the room at the request of school President Fred Pestello. 

Meanwhile, McCulloch continued giving his speech as people in the crowd kept making comments, their voices often competing with his. 

One of the lecture's organizers banged a gavel in an unsuccessful attempt to restore order.
