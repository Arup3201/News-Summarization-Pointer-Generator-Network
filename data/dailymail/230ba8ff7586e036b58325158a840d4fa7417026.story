A recent report found that as people upgrade from the iPhone 5S to the 6 and 6 Plus, the amount they use their devices increases.

In particular, people with an iPhone 5S were found to use their phones 55 per cent of the time compared to 80 per cent for the 6 Plus.

And now a separate study has discovered that all of this extra use equates to twice the amount of mobile data, on average.

The figures are taken from Florida-based Citrix’s latest Mobile Analytics Report that collected data usage from mobile network subscribers. The report found iPhone 6 Plus owners use twice the amount of data than the iPhone 6 and this is linked to 6 Plus users being more engaged with their devices

The figures were taken from Florida-based Citrix’s latest Mobile Analytics Report that collected data usage from mobile network subscribers.

By studying business and personal use, the report found iPhone 6 Plus owners use twice the amount of data as iPhone 6 users, and 10 times as much as those who own the 3GS.

'iPhone 6 Plus subscribers generate the most data volume, double that of an iPhone 6,' explained the report. 

Pocket studied more than two million articles and videos opened using its app.

It compared the before-and-after behaviour of iPhone and iPad users and found people with an iPhone 5S use their phone 55 per cent of the time. 

This increases to 72 per cent for the iPhone 6 and 80 per cent for the iPhone 6 Plus - both at the detriment of the iPad.  

Those with the iPhone 6 now open 33 per cent more articles and videos in Pocket than they did with a 5 or 5S, and those with the 6 Plus open 65 per cent more items than they did with a smaller phone.

'This increase impacts subscribers when choosing a new device [and] clearly the phablet sized iPhone 6 Plus shows data usage patterns more akin to tablet usage.'

In a blog post, the firm added: 'Advice to those seeking to upgrade to an iPhone 6 Plus: your data plan bill is about to get bigger!'

Citrix links this to the fact iPhone 6 Plus users are typically more engaged with their devices.

These claims are in reference to previous research, including stats by Pocket app, which found people with the iPhone 6 open 33 per cent more articles and videos than they did with a 5S, and those with a 6 Plus open 65 per cent more items than before.

Pocket found that users with both an iPhone and an iPad watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus.

Citrix’s report also found that 4G networks are increasing the amount of data being used.

Almost 80 per cent of mobile Netflix subscribers watch videos on their phones for more than five minutes at a time, 22 per cent watch for between five and 15 minutes, and 21 per cent watch for 30 to 60 minutes at time.

And the majority of this content is viewed on 4G networks.

Analysis from Quartz also suggested that the way the cameras capture data on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus could also be to blame for the surge in data.

‘Both phones tout very similar 8-megapixel cameras, but the image stabilisation found only on the iPhone 6 Plus allows it to capture more detail, which translates to larger file sizes,’ explained Alice Truong.

She references, in particular, two identical photos taken by BGR editor-in-chief Jonathan Geller.

An image taken on the iPhone 6 took up 3MB of space, while the iPhone 6 Plus image was 4MB.

If these photos are then stored online or shared on social networks, this requires more data.
