A newly-crowned carnival princess has been stripped of her title after organisers spotted an 'inappropriate' piercing on her neck.

Sharlie Lightfoot, 15, of Faversham, Kent, was chosen to represent Teynham earlier this month and was due to make her first public appearance at Sittingbourne Carnival next month.

But this week the teenager was sacked from the job for the piercing at the back of her neck, which organisers saw on her Facebook page.

Axed: Sharlie Lightfoot, 15, of Faversham, Kent, who was stripped of her carnival princess title for her metal bar neck piercing

Fuming, Miss Lightfoot said there had been 'no mention' of piercings when she was awarded the role, something the organisers admit.

The teen said she would not have had the piercing if she had known it would cost her the title, but did admit to having a tattoo, despite being underage.

Miss Lightfoot said: 'I signed a contract and it didn't say anything about piercings so I never imagined I'd get sacked for it.

'I had a tattoo clearly on show when I was selected and no one seemed to mind that, so I didn't think twice about the piercing.

'Being in a carnival means everything to me. I have always wanted to do it.'

Honour: Miss Lightfoot's mother Jodie said it had been her daughter's dream to represent the town of Teynham in the carnival line-up

Miss Lightfoot has offered to replace the metal bar with a transparent one or to take it out completely but she was told by organisers that it was too late.

Miss Lightfood's mother, Jodie, 33, said: 'It was her dream. It is so unfair they have taken it away from her.'

Teynham carnival chairman, Terry West, said: 'I saw the picture and decided it wasn't satisfactory for a girl representing Teynham, so the only thing I could do was to take away her sash.

'You hope the girls will set an example as they are meeting mayors, MPs and councillors. I don't think a neck piercing is appropriate.

'Unfortunately she has ruined it for herself. But she is welcome to try again next year - without the piercing.'

Mr West admitted he had never specified a policy on body piercings but would formulate new rules for next year's court.
