The partner of comic author Tom Sharpe who died in Spain last year has driven his ashes 1,200 miles to a small Northumberland church for an impromptu burial service.

His partner of ten years,  Montserrat Verdaguer i Clavera, left the Costa Brava with the author's ashes in the passenger seat  and travelling through Spain and France before boarding the Channel Tunnel to England.

Ms Clavera dug a hole with her bare hands in St Aidan's cemetery, Thokrington before holding the unconventional service. She placed a cuban cigar, a pen as well as a bottle of whisky on the small mound.

The author had written of his desire 
to return to Thokrington as his father had been based at St Aidan's 
Church and is buried in the cemetery.

One
 of the photographs brought by Ms Clavera to Northumberland was an image
 of the writer as a chlid standing beside his father outside the church.

The prolific author 
had several of his novels adapted for film and television moved to Spain
 in the mid 1990s where he befriended his partner and her late husband.

After Ms Clavera's husband died, the widow moved in with Mr Sharpe.

Ms Clavera discovered the writer's wish to return to Northumberland while looking through some papers after his death.

Ms Clavera brought a photograph of the young Tom Sharpe taken by his father George in Thockrington, and placed it alongside a Cuban cigar, a bottle of Grouse whisky and the writer's favourite pen.

She said: 'In this ancient church in Northumberland in which your father was buried, you will remain for eternity. In the middle of nowhere, in an empty place, surrounded by grass and sheep. Tom Sharpe, rest in peace forever.' 

She said she first met the author in 1994 when he bought a house in Spain. When her husband died a decade ago, she moved in with Mr Sharpe.

'He was a marvellous man. Very intelligent, very nice. Sometimes he had an explosion - he could get very cross about things. Then 10 or 15 minutes later he’d be fine.'

Ms Clavera
 met Mr Sharpe's friend Charlie Harrison who had known the writer for 
the past 25 years. Mr Harrison befriended the author when he was visiting the area.

He said: 'I saw this chap looking confused. I went over to help. He said he was looking for Pasture House as his father had lived there. I asked: "Are you Tom Sharpe? I saw you on the TV aweek ago." We became good friends.

'Tom loved this area. His grandfather William was a stonemason for the Belsay estate.

'He would come back at every opportunity and had friends round this area. He was a wonderful guy, but I used to say he was a bit crazy. He had some funny ideas. He would have loved this.'

The 900-year-old graveyard attached to 
St Aidan's is also the final resting place of William Beveridge, who 
wrote the report which led to the foundation of the welfare state and 
female aviation pioneer Connie Leathart.

Rev Michael Slade said he would like to know where the writer is buried 'to keep a record for posterity's sake'.

However, Church authorities want to speak to Mr Sharpe's family about the unauthorised burial. Martin
 Sheppard, spokesman for the Diocese of Newcastle said: 'There are rules
 and regulations, traditions and customs around churchyards to keep them as they are.

'That’s why people want to be buried there, it’s a particular kind of place.'

Mr Sheppard refused to say whether Mr Sharpe's ashes would have to be removed from the graveyard.

He said: 'I don’t want to speculate on what might happen.'

Several of Sharpe's novels were adapted for television and film such as WIlt (left) starring Griff Rhys Jones and Mel Smith and Porterhouse Blue (right) featuring David Jason
