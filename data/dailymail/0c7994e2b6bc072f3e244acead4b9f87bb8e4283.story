Russell Slade insists he is focussing on nothing but Leyton Orient's League One play-off final at Wembley on Sunday amid interest from West Bromwich Albion.

Slade, who was named the this season's League Managers Association League One manager of the year alongside Wolves boss Kenny Jackett, is a target for West Brom who sacked former boss Pepe Mel two weeks ago.

But the 53-year-old is refusing to look beyond Sunday afternoon against Rotherham when he attempts to get Orient into the second tier of English football for the first time in 32 years.

In demand: Leyton Orient boss Russell Slade is the focus of interest from Premier League club West Brom

Focussed: Slade says top-flight interest is 'nice' but he's concentrating on Orient's play-off final at Wembley

Slade said: 'It's been brought to my attention, I honestly didn't know about it before.

'Other than my chairman banging on about how good I am it's probably appreciated in other quarters the kind of job we've done here.

'It's nice to be recognised for the work we've done on no money and had a relatively successful season. It will only be truly successful if we get promoted on Sunday.'

He added: 'It's nice to be linked to a Premier League club when you're a League One manager, of course.

'But the total focus is my football club. For me, I just want to get us up into the Championship. I've got a two-year deal here.'Â
