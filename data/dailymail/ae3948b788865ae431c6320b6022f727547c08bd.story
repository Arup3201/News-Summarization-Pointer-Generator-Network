A Florida judge has slapped Democratic congressman Alan Grayson with a restraining order after his estranged wife complained that he had battered her over the weekend and said she feared for her safety and the safety of their two smallest children.

Lolita Grayson's sworn complaint says the congressman 'showed up, unannounced' as she was preparing to take the two young children to a play date and asked to speak with her inside their house.

When she refused, according to a sheriff's office document, he 'deliberately and with force pushed [Lolita] very hard against the front door, causing [her] to fall to the ground as a result.'

After telling her husband not to touch her, Lolita said, she pushed him in the face and struck him in the stomach with her knee 'in order to protect and defend herself,' then called 911.

Rep. Grayson roughhoused with son Stone Grayson in 2010 while son Storm Grayson played, shortly after he lost his House seat -- which he regained two years later

Grayson's press secretary, Lauren 
Doney was quick to deny the charge, which sheriff's paperwork said 
sparked  a 'domestic-violence battery' investigation.

The accusations 'are absolutely false, completely unfounded, and clearly designed to vilify and harm Congressman Grayson,' Doney said in a statement.

'Congressman Grayson firmly denies Ms. Grayson's frivolous accusations.'

A member of Grayson's staff told the  Orlando Sentinel that he watched the exchange from 15 feet away, and denied that his boss assaulted anyone.

'Absolutely not,' said Juan Lopez, the congressman's director of constituent services. 'It's just unfortunate that this is happening and that she would say something like this.'

Grayson's office piled on later in the day, saying that '[s]adly, it was Ms. Grayson who physically attacked the congressman as he attempted to visit with his children.'

'He did not respond to Ms. Grayson’s violent assault,' read a statement.

Grayson caught flak from anti-Obamacare Republicans when he claimed during a House speech that the GOP wanted sick Americans to 'DIE QUICKLY'

Grayson once compared tea party conservatives to the Ku Klux Klan, claiming that both were equal sources of hate and intolerance

But Lolita Grayson's petition added that while she spoke with the emergency operator, Rep. Grayson told her within earshot of their kids that she 'would receive nothing' in their divorce and would be left 'in the gutter.'

She also alleges that 'from time to time' in the past, the congressman 'has battered [her] and the parties' minor children' in incidents that did not lead her to file for injunctions from the courts.

The result, she claims, is that his 'history of violence' toward her has made her fear for her safety.

The Sentinel reported that the congressman's wife filed for divorce two months ago, and that her attorneys filed photos showing 'large bruises to her left leg and left shoulder.'

The Orange County Sheriff's Office declined to provide the photos to MailOnline. A hearing is scheduled on March 20. The injunction will remain in force at least until that date.

Grayson is a Democratic lightning rod in the House of Representatives. In October his re-election campaign emailed a fundraising solicitation that compared the conservative tea party to the Ku Klux Klan.

A burning cross took the place of the 'T' in 'Tea Party.'

Grayson's campaign slogan, 'A Congressman With Guts,' may come back to haunt him in divorce proceedings if his wife's charges are substantiated

He later defended the mailing, citing 'overwhelming evidence that the tea party is the home of bigotry and discrimination in America today, just as the KKK was for an earlier generation.'

In September 2009 Grayson combated Republicans' objections to the Affordable Care Act by slamming the GOP's proposed alternatives in fiery rhetoric on the House floor.

'If you get sick, America,' he said, 'the Republican health care plan is this: Die quickly.'

Signs behind him during the short speech read, 'The Republican health care plan: Don't get sick. And if you do get sick ... DIE QUICKLY.'

Tennessee Republican Rep. Jimmy Duncan broke with decorum on the spot to lay into Grayson, saying, 'That is about the most mean-spirited partisan statement that I've ever heard made on this floor, and I, for one, don't appreciate it.'

Offering a passive-aggressive apology, Grayson later returned to the floor to say that '“I apologize to the dead and their families that we haven't voted sooner to end this holocaust in America.'

Grayson has also used targeted websites to oppose military action in Syria and to shame Republicans with a lengthy list of Americans he claimed had died because they lacked health insurance.

An aide to retired Army Lt. Col. Allen West, who defeated Grayson in a 2010 election before losing the seat back to him in 2012, declined comment.

Col. West has been married for 25 years and has two teenage daughters with his wife Angela.
