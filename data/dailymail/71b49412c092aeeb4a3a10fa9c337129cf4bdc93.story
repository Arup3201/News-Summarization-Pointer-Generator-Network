He's famous for his casual style, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg put on a tie to meet Japan's Prime Minister on Thursday and claimed he is different like his portrayal in The Social Network.

The billionaire says Japan's massive tsunami inspired him to seek more ways for his social network to help people hit by natural disasters.

Zuckerberg, who is visiting Japan after a stop in China, told Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda that he believes Facebook can be used to help people in disasters keep in touch and provide them with crucial information.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda and said he was inspired by the tsunami to find ways for his social network to help out during disasters

He did not go into details during the brief meeting.

Noda expressed his appreciation and said he felt odd meeting the young entrepreneur after seeing the hit movie The Social Network, which was based on Zuckerberg's life and the legal problems he had with others during Facebook's early days.

Laughing, Zuckerberg said the Hollywood portrayal of him wasn't completely on target.

'Very different,' he said.

The young tycoon laughed and seemed at ease during the meeting, during which he claimed he is 'very different' from how The Social Network movie portrayed him

Earlier in the week Zuckerberg and his girlfriend were spotted in Shanghai.

They look like a typical couple out exploring an unfamiliar city during a trip overseas but the casually-dressed tourists walking the back streets of Shanghai were not backpackers, rather it was the billionaire Facebook founder and his girlfriend Priscilla Chan.

The pair took in the sites near Fuxing Road in the Chinese financial center.

And, true to hi-tech form, when they appeared to get lost, Miss Chan, who is Chinese-American and originally from Boston, pulled out an iPad to pinpoint their location.

Sharp dressed man: Zuckerberg's suit, tie and polished shoes in Tokyo were a far cry from his casual everyday wear and the jeans, trainers and hoodie that he donned in Shanghai earlier this week. In The Social Network his character, played by Jesse Eisenberg, wears sandals and pajamas to an important meeting

The sighting of Mr Zuckerberg - wearing his trademark hooded top and jeans - led
to speculation that Facebook could be looking for business 
opportunities in China, the world's largest online marketplace.

It is believed that the social network's CEO flew into the country aboard a private jet with Apple chief executive Tim Cook.

Facebook is now used by 845million people across the world, but remains blocked by the Chinese authorities.

Along with Twitter and YouTube, it cannot be accessed in the country because of what is nicknamed the Great Firewall.

Mr Zuckerberg has been learning 
Mandarin for a couple of years and has never been coy about his dreams 
of breaking into the Chinese market.

At a speaking engagement in October 2010, he asked: 'How can you connect the whole world if you leave out 1.6 billion people?

'Our theory is that if we can show 
that we as a western company can succeed in a place where no other 
country has, then we can start to figure out the right partnerships we 
would need to succeed in China on our terms.'

Mr Zuckerberg and Miss Chan have been seeing each other for eight years after meeting when they were both studying at Harvard.

At time they were both ordinary students. The Facebook founder is now one of the youngest billionaires in the world.
