Mo'ne Davis captivated the nation during her run in the Little League World Series, but the first girl to pitch a shut out won't play in the final.

Davis' Taney Dragons of Philadelphia lost to Chicago's Jackie Robinson West team Thursday night at a game held in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.

Jackie Robinson West, a team made up of all black players, will now move on to play Las Vegas on Saturday in the championship.

Swing: Davis hits the ball in the second inning against the Jackie Robinson West on Thursday

The Dragons started the game off in the lead, with 2-0 but quickly lost that by the bottom of the first inning when Robinson came up 4-2.

Robinson led the way for the rest of the game, settling with 6-4 in the sixth inning.

The team will face off against Las Vegas at 3:30pm on Saturday. The winner of that game will play in the World Series final on Sunday.

While girls have played in the World Series before, none before had pitched a no-hitter like 13-year-old Davis did last Friday. She is the 18th girl to appear in the tournament.  

She has also become the first Little League player of either gender to score a Sports Illustrated cover - and Wednesday's performance puts her in good company. 

Moving on: The Jackie Robinson West crew will go on to play Las Vegas on Saturday 

Honor: The disappointing performance came after it was announced that she will become the first Little Leaguer - of either gender - to ever grace the cover of Sports Illustrated. It is due out August 25

Now that her time in the tournament is over, Davis is likely looking forward to starting the eighth grade.

In her interview with Sports Illustrated, Davis said her first love is basketball and that she hopes to one day play for the legendary University of Connecticut team.

She started playing baseball after a coach spotted her skills throwing a football.

She is the only girl on her team.
