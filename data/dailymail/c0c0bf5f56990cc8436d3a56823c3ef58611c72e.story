A Minnesota man has confessed and apologized for defacing a Montana monument, saying he did it out of love for his new bride who was dealing with a cancer scare.

Cole Randall, 23, said it was just a misguided declaration of love when he carved a pair of names into the national monument Pompeys Pillar on October 10.

In Randall's statement, released today, he confessed that his misguided judgement came to play when his honeymoon with Shpresa Lleshaj was cut short in October when she found 'a suspicious lump on her breast', the Star Tribune reported.

Crazy in love: Cole Randall and Shpresa Lieshiaj, aka Flora Cash, visited Pompeys Pillar and left an inscription of their names on it

'Senseless vandalism': Randall was arrested for creating this graffiti, found just three feet from the 1806 signature of Captain William Clark which made Pomeys Pillar a landmark

He wrote: 'I was scared... terrified 
actually, worst-case scenarios raced through my mind. When love and fear
of loss team up, we sometimes lose our better judgment... if something 
were to happen to my wife, I could come back to this place years from 
now and see her and my names together.'

Officials have to perform 'damage assessment' to the sandstone column before deciding if felony charges will be filed.

The
monument also bears the inscription of the passage of the Lewis and 
Clark expedition that explored the American West 207 years ago.

Randall's letter said that he and Clark were both following an American Indian tradition of leaving their names.

However, in 1991 the monument was purchased by the federal government and signs were put up prohibiting defacing the monument.

Randall says he's prepared to face the consequences of his actions.

National monument: Deputies were alarmed to find the carving so close to this historical etching, one of the last remaining pieces of physical evidence of the Lewis and Clark expedition

Cole
Randall and Shpresa Lieshiaj perform as folk duo Flora Cash. They were 
questioned at Pompeys Pillar several weeks ago after setting off a 
silent alarm.

It wasn't
until a week later that a staff member inspecting the grounds noticed 
that the monument, inscribed with Captain William Clark's signature in 
1806, had been vandalized.

The carving reads ‘Cole + 
Shpresa 10/10/2013’ with a love heart and was found by shocked deputies at 
the famous monument in Montana.

Randall ignored the warning signs, security cameras and railings.

The
1806 signature is one of the last remaining pieces of physical evidence
of the Lewis and Clark expedition, the first explorers to cross the 
western region of America.

Jonathan Peart, the director of Friends of Pompeys Pillar, told 3KRTV.com:
‘This belongs to all of us - to you, to me to every American out there 
and to deface this is just a senseless act of vandalism and violence to 
something that has historical and cultural importance.’

A silent alarm alerted Bureau of Land Management (BLM) deputies that someone had climbed over the guard rail on October 10.

Consequences: The couple were questioned after setting off a silent alarm but when the vandalism was discovered officials sought a more serious response

Historical importance: The man faces felony charges for defacing Pomeys Pillar (pictured), a 150-foot sandstone butte in the Yellowstone Valley

To remove the graffiti will cost between $4,000 and $5,000, according to the Friends of Pompeys Pillar.

The monument is open to the public on foot every day of the year but barriers restrict visitor access to the signature.

Captain William Clark scrawled his name and the date, July 25, 1806, on the 150-foot sandstone butte in the Yellowstone Valley after his return to America. The signature looks as it did some 200 years ago.

The monument, 25 miles northeast of Billings, Montana, attracts some 50,000 every year. It was named a national monument in 2001.

The Flora Cash Facebook site and blog have been disabled.

According to the Billings Gazette, the monument was also defaced in June 2012.

National treasure: The graffiti is estimated to cost between $4,000 and $5,000 to remove from the National Monument
