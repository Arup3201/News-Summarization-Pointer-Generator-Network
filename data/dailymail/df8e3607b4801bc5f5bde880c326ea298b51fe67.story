Scotland Yard Commissioner: Bernard Hogan-Howe has said burglary is at a 27-year low

Burglary victims reacted with fury yesterday after Britain’s most senior police officer claimed that families were safer in their homes than they had been for a generation.

Scotland Yard commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe said  burglary was at a 27-year low  and people should not ‘despair about crime’ because statistics showed it was falling.

However, his comments were criticised by victims and campaigners last night, who said the crime continues to ‘wreck lives’.

It also comes just a week after  the most senior judge in England and Wales defended the right of householders to protect themselves and their home from intruders.

At a meeting with London Mayor Boris Johnson, Mr Hogan-Howe said: ‘Although people sometimes despair about crime, burglary is at a 27-year low right around the country. Burglary is going down.

‘People often don’t think they’re safe in their house; they’re actually more safe than they have ever been in a generation.’

A total of 245,317 house burglaries were recorded in 2011/12, compared with 519,265 in 1997, the crime survey of England and Wales reveals.

In London, the overall burglary rate fell by 3.4 per cent, although some boroughs have seen increases of almost a third.

Last night, burglary victim Jayne Chedgzoy challenged Mr Hogan-Howe to come to her home to see the lingering impact that burglars have had on her family.

The 46-year-old said her life was 
shattered when thieves broke into her house in Rotherham and stole 
thousands of pounds saved for her disabled daughter, as well as her 
wedding and engagement rings.

‘People might well say that burglary 
is not a problem but that is nonsense,’ she said. ‘It’s very real to 
people like me and he wants to come up around here.

'Traumatic': The charity Victim Support has said burglary remains a 'very real threat'

‘I lock all the doors and windows at 
8pm every night. It will never leave me. You’ve got to live with this 
for the rest of your life.’ Last week, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord 
Judge, became the latest  high-profile official to speak out on the 
right of householders to defend their property after a Leicestershire 
couple were arrested over the shooting of two intruders.

‘If your home is burgled and you’re in
 there, you have the right to get rid of the burglar,’ Lord Judge said. 
‘When you’re at home you want to feel safe, and in my opinion you’re 
entitled to feel safe and secure.’

Javed Khan, of Victim Support, said: ‘We know that burglary remains a very real threat.

‘Having your home broken into is traumatic and can leave people feeling unsafe and anxious.

‘People can reduce the risk of  burglary by making sure their home is as secure as it can be.’

Mr Hogan-Howe added that he remains determined to catch burglars and that the numbers of those traced has improved dramatically.

He said: 'I would never diminish someone having their house burgled. Numerically it is not a frequent offence but it is a very serious one which is why we always treat it seriously but we are seeing an improvement in burglary.'
