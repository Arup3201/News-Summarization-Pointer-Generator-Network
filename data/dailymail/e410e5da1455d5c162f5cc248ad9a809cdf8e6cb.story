Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent.

We'll start in Spain where the focus is on Real Madrid president Florentino Perez and the emergency press conference called on Thursday to express his support for Carlo Ancelotti.

After originally reporting that Ancelotti would be sacked if his side lost to Barcelona next week, Marca report that 'Perez contradicts' the Madrid daily newspaper while labelling the situation as 'Florentino's war'.  

Marca lead with Florentino Perez's 'war' against the press following his emergency press conference

AS use the headline 'Florentino dressed up as (Jose) Mourinho' as they cover Perez's 'attack'

Perez jumped to the defence of both Real Madrid boss Ancelotti and record signing Gareth Bale on Thursday

In direct response to Marca's original report, Perez said on Thursday: 'I want to state categorically that the club has full confidence in our coach and in our players. 

'And I want to say, contrary to a report published today, that whatever happens in the coming days and weeks Carlo Ancelotti will remain the coach of Real Madrid.

'To use the fact that we are not on our best form at the moment to report information that is not true is unacceptable.'

Marca's front page features five different images of Perez as the president 'defends Iker (Casillas), Cristiano (Ronaldo) and (Gareth) Bale and asks for unity'.

AS also cover the emergency press conference, covering a range of quotes from Perez, including: 'I understand that some media want to have influence, but they are going too far.'

Away from the Perez saga, AS also report that Barcelona star Sergio Busquets will 'find it difficult' to be fit in time for the El Clasico on March 22 as he looks to recover from ankle ligament damage.   

Marca ran with the headline: 'Not One More' and claimed the Italian was close to the sack on Thursday

Over to Italy now, where the main focus is on how the Italian's teams got on in Thursday night's Europa League clashes. 

Corriere dello Sport hail 'King' Gonzalo Higuain for a brilliant hat-trick against Dinamo Moscow as the Argentina striker guided Rafael Benitez's team to a 3-1 last 16 first leg victory. 

La Gazzetta dello Sport hone in on Inter Milan's 3-1 'ugly' defeat against in-form Wolfsburg as the Italian outlet point fingers at manager Roberto Mancini for his 'unconvincing changes'.
