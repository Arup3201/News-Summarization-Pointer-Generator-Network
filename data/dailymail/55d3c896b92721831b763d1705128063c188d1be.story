President John F Kennedy had a speech prepared in October 1962 announcing to the American people a full scale invasion of Cuba, it has been revealed.

He planned to deliver the speech if Soviet ships carrying strategic nuclear missiles reached the island, according to papers released from Robert F Kennedy’s personal files by the John F Kennedy Presidential Library.

The Cuban Missile Crisis began 50 years ago this week, but even now the world is still learning just how close it was to nuclear Armageddon during those 13 tense days.

'My fellow Americans, with a heavy heart, and in necessary fulfillment of my oath of office, I have ordered - and the United States Air Force has now carried out - military operations with conventional weapons only, to remove a major nuclear weapons build-up from the soil of Cuba,' read a draft speech JFK planned to read.

Those remarks were among the many private thoughts revealed in new papers released by the estate of Robert F Kennedy, who served as Attorney General and his brother's closest confidant during the missile crisis.

Harvard University professor and Cuban Missile Crisis scholar Graham Allison writes in the Christian Science Monitor that an American strike would have been an almost certain precursor to World War III, which would have cost hundreds of millions of lives - at least.

RFK detailed a plan offered by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to bomb Cuba with 500 sorties and then invade with 90,000 American troops if Soviet ships broke a blockade and brought strategic nuclear missiles to the nation 90 miles off the coast of Florida.

'If we go in, we go in hard,' RFK wrote.

Brink of war: The National Security Council provided JFK's key advice during the missile crisis, though RFK said only his brother was able to lead the world away from the edge of disaster

RFK scribbled notes during a meeting about a possible airstrike on Cuba. 'Invasion must follow!!' was McNamara's message.

The strategic nature of the Russians' nuclear weapons was one of the reasons why their close proximity caused such alarm at the White House.

Strategic nuclear weapons are used to attack, as their name suggests, particular strategic targets, such as military installations, missile command centers or cities.

Tactical nuclear weapons tend to be smaller devices that are used on the battlefield.

Professor Allison believes that the Russians would have responded to an invasion with tactical nuclear rockets - striking American ships and troops.

Americans had no knowledge that these smaller nuclear weapons were already on the island.

The Americans would have likely used nuclear weapons of their own, almost certainly drawing in a further Soviet nuclear response.

RFK's papers reveal that outcome didn't happen only because JFK and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev both realized the severity of what was coming.

The Soviet ships carrying missiles to Cuba turned back thanks to a series of public, private and secret concessions - including the withdrawal of NATO missiles from Turkey.

Though the documents, released just shy of the 50th
anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis, don't rewrite Cold War history, they
do provide insight into the personal thoughts of the era's key figures,
historians say.

Kennedy advised John F. Kennedy during the Bay of Pigs
invasion and the missile crisis, key moments during his brother's presidency.

His title as attorney general ‘disguised his real position,
which was the closest adviser to the president and the president's confidant
and the person the president trusted most,’ said journalist and historian
Michael Dobbs, who blogs for Foreign Policy.

‘That's the interesting point of
this, that he kind of reflects his brother's thinking.’

The seven boxes of newly released material include
telegrams, reports, meeting transcripts and handwritten notes by Kennedy, some
with doodles and quotes in the margins.

Historical marginalia: Robert Kennedy doodled the Liberty Bell and wrote down a quote from a Polish World War II memorial in Italy

‘It gives you a sort of insight into what was on his mind,
what he doodled,’ Dobbs said. ‘It's interesting from a human perspective.’

One page, sandwiched between lined pages of notes on the Bay
of Pigs invasion, includes a sketch of the Liberty Bell with a summarized quote
from a Polish World War II memorial in Italy.

‘We the Soldiers of Poland for your liberty and ours give
our souls to god, our bodies to Italy and our hearts to Poland,’ Kennedy wrote
in pencil.

The 1961 botched invasion sought to oust communists with the
help of anti-Castro Cuban exiles and veiled U.S. support. More than 100 members
of the CIA-sponsored invasion team were killed and many were captured by Cuban
forces.

One CIA document offers a profile of Castro: It calls him
intelligent but ‘not very stable’ and ‘touchy, impatient and rash.’

Another outlines plans to assassinate Castro, including a
1964 plan with connections to the Mafia.

The mob and ‘patriotic Cuban exiles’
eventually settled on a payment of $100,000 for assassinating Castro, $20,000
for his brother Raul and $20,000 for revolutionary Ernesto Che Guevara, plus
$2,500 for expenses.

Another prominent thread throughout the documents is the
13-day crisis over Soviet missiles in Cuba.

On one white page from a meeting on October 16, 1962, the first
day of the crisis, Kennedy wrote out two columns: proponents of a blockade
against Cuba and supporters of a military strike.

‘It's interesting to see in his handwriting who's on which
side,’ Dobbs said.

The blockade won out.

How Fidel recruited SS troops for the Cold War:

Nazi training: The ex-Cuban leader, pictured in 2004, allegedly hired ex-SS officers to train his troops

Fidel Castro recruited former members of the Nazi SS to train Cuban troops during the Cold War, newly-released German secret service files have revealed.

The then Communist President of Cuba also bought Belgian-fabricated arms from two middle-men who had strong links to the extreme German right.

It sheds light on the extent Castro, who in public was stringently committed to socialism, was willing to go in order to further his grip on the island nation and prevent an invasion from the U.S.

Bodo Hechelhammer, historical investigations director at German foreign intelligence agency Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) said: 'Evidently, the Cuban revolutionary army did not fear contagion from personal links to Nazism, so long as it served its objectives.'

The documents, released by the BND and published online by German newspaper Die Welt, show a series of plans developed in October 1962 - at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

JFK's 'threesome with Elizabeth Taylor and actor Robert Slack':

In a week of revelations about JFK's times as President, another alleged event came from an unexpected source.

A biography on Elizabeth Taylor released this week claims that the actress slept with Presidents Ronald Reagan and John F Kennedy.

The former liaison allegedly occurred when she was a teenager, with the latter encounter reportedly taking place as a threesome with actor Robert Stack.

The authors claim 
it was a nude dip in JFK's pool that would turn into a threesome between
the actress, the politician and actor Robert Stack.

The
book also claims that Taylor counted Peter Lawford, Errol Flynn, Tony 
Curtis, Paul Newman and Frank Sinatra as lovers - her romance with Ol' 
Blue Eyes becoming one of the more serious.
