Four people were killed today when their business jet from the UK struck a power pylon in thick fog as it was coming into land at an airfield in Germany.

The aircraft - with two businessmen and two passengers aboard - was travelling from Shoreham airport in West Sussex to the landing strip at Foehren 15 miles from Trier when it crashed into a landfill site. Â 

A spokesman for Trier-Fohren airfield said all the deceased were German.

Wreckage: This is the burnt-out wreckage of the business jet that crashed in Germany today, killing four people

Disaster: The plane from the UK struck a power pylon in thick fog as it was coming into land at an airfield

Crash: The aircraft - with two businessmen and two passengers aboard - was travelling from Shoreham airport in West Sussex to the landing strip at Foehren 15 miles from Trier when it crashed into a landfill site

'On board were two passengers and two pilots,' said Stephan Christ, local civil defence organiser.

'We
 believe the passengers are businessmen from the Trier area. They hit a 
high power mast on the way into land. The power in the area has been 
switched off.'

The 
twin-engine jet plane with American registration burst into flames upon
 impact. Media reports said it burned for 90 minutes before firemen 
using a mixture of water and foam extinguished the flames.

'There was not a chance for anyone on board to live through this,' said a police spokesman.

The aircraft, a Cessna Citation 501, came down near the Trier-Koblenz motorway near the picturesque Moselle River.

Horrific: The twin-engine jet plane with American registration is believed to have burst into flames upon impact

Response: Media reports said the aircraft burned for 90 minutes before firemen extinguished the flames

A
 wing of the aircraft was still hanging from power lines hours after the
 midday collision. The airplane crashed some 300ft from the pylon but it
 was not immediately clear if the crash occurred as a result of striking
 the pylon or if the plane hit it on its doomed descent.

Local
 newspaper Trierische Volksfreunde said the plane had been chartered - 
or was owned - by a business in the region but the firm was not named.

Air
 traffic investigators sealed off the site after the flames were 
extinguished. German authorities have not released the names of the 
victims.

There was no immediate word on a possible cause for the crash.
