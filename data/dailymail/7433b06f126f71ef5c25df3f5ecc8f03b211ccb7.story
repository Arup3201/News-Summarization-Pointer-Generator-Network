Back in the game: 17-year-old Erin Cox played her first volleyball game since being suspended for trying to give a drunken friend a ride home from a party

Erin Cox, 17, played her first volleyball game last night since being benched for five games and stripped of her title as team captain for trying to give a drunken friend a ride home.

Erin's return to the court was triumphant, contributing 16 assists in North Andover High School's the 3-0 victory over Billerica. But her parent's legal battle against the school district for the harsh discipline of their daughter is ongoing.

It was earlier reported that a police officer actually vouched for Erin's sobriety at the party, but that school administrators decided to punish Erin anyway because of a zero tolerance for underage drinking.Â 

As Erin's parents attempt to sue the school in federal court, their lawyer Wendy Murphy released the content of that email to the North Andover Citizen.

In the email, Officer Brian Neeley of the Boxford Police describes breaking up the party and speaking with Erin while she waited for her mother to arrive.

'Erin did not have the slightest odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from her person,' he wrote.

'She was polite, articulate, steady on her feet, and very remorseful for her decision to go into the residence but was only helping out a friend that had called her for a ride.'

Earlier that night, Erin was finishing up her shift at a local restaurant when she got a text message from a friend asking her to pick her up at a party because she was too drunk to drive home.

Shortly after arriving at the house to help her friend, police arrived and cited the 15 North Andover students inside.

Despite Officer Neeley's vouch for her innocence, the school suspended Erin from volleyball for five games and took away her title of team captain.

No excuse: One of the police officers who broke up the party sent an email to school administrators, vouching for Erin's sobriety but that didn't stop them from punishing her. Above, Erin (#12) with her North Andover team

This prompted Erin's outraged parents to file a lawsuit against the school. While a state judge ruled that he didn't have jurisdiction in the case, the Cox family are continuing to seek legal damages from the school through federal court.

The lawsuit has made Erin's story national news, and many are blaming the school for seemingly discouraging students from being sober drivers.

The Boston Globe published an editorial today, condemning the school administration's behavior.

'North Andover - and all other communities - should make clear that sober students who provide rides for intoxicated friends won't be subject to punishment,' the editorial board wrote. 'The toll of drunken driving is simply too high to discourage this form of safe transportation.'

But so far, the school administration has defended their position.

Right and wrong: So far, the school has refused to back down on their decision to punish Erin

'While some may decry the Administration's actions as unfair or inconsistent with the principles of due process, our Administration wholeheartedly disagrees,' Superintendent Kevin Hutchinson told FoxNews.com.

'To be clear, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that participation in interscholastic athletics is a privilege. Rather than simply revoking the privilege, our Administration has consistently afforded its student-athletes a reasonable opportunity to be heard before a disciplinary decision is made,' Hutchinson said.

However, the administration's decision to punish Erin may have consequences far beyond the walls of North Andover. Her parents are worried the suspension may have impact on Erin's ability to play volleyball in college.

'They aren't sure and have gotten mixed answers,' Ms Murphy said.

While Erin told the Boston Herald on Sunday that she felt 'defeated' for trying to do the right thing - she also said she would still make the same decision if she could do it all over.

But Erin is being rewarded for her good deed - just not through the school. 33-year-old Matt Holland, a one-time high school athlete himself, started 'The Erin Cox Fund' on the web site GoFundMe.com.

Mr Holland's original goal was to raise $1,000 in a scholarship fund for Erin, but it seems the fund got more donations than he expected and was more recently changed to $6,500. As over Saturday morning, Erin's scholarship fund had gathered $5,875.
