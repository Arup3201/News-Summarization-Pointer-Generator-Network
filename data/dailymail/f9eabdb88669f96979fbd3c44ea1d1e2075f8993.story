A driver who apparently collided with a cyclist after a row on the road bragged on Twitter she had 'purposefully run him over' and was 'definitely still drunk' at the time.

The motorist, named online as Daisy Abela from Bromley, has since apologised and says she has spoken to the Metropolitan Police about her 'exaggerated' comments, which were picked up by cyclists who began haranguing her.

She wrote on Saturday morning: 'Just had
a full on barney with a cyclist he started banging on my roof so I 
purposely run him over LOL see yaaaaa #c****'

It comes months after accountancy 
trainee Emma Way, 21, boasted about having knocked a cyclist off his bike and
through a hedge on Twitter, and she has since been charged with various driving offences.

Row: Tweeting under the name Daisy Abela, this driver said she had 'purposely' knocked down a cyclist after a row

Incident: Miss Abela claimed that as she overtook a group of cyclists, one pulled out towards her which led to an altercation (file picture)

In this new Twitter storm Miss Abela wrote: 'I was definitely still drunk! If there's anything I hate in this world it's f****** cyclists.

'I didn't kill the poor f*****. I knocked him off his bike but still managed to continue my journey with 1 wing mirror lol.'

The tweets led to her getting abuse on Twitter and also on cycling forums, where she was called an 'anti-cyclist moron'.

But today Miss Abela has clarified her comments and said the incident was 'not a drunken hit and run' and the tweets were a 'stupid joke'.

'I would like to start off firstly by apologising for any offence I may have caused other cyclists with my tweets on Saturday,' she wrote.

'I did not intend to upset anybody. Truth is I was joking with a friend, I thought it was a conversation between two people. This incident was NOT a drunken hit and run.

'My comments were terribly exaggerated and made in anger after being physically and verbally attacked by the cyclist.

'This was investigated by the Metropolitan Police and has been resolved'.

Argument: Tweeting a friend Miss Abela explained how she had driven off with one wing mirror, but she has since said this was exaggerated

Claim: This tweet also said 'I was definitely still drunk' and that the driver hates cyclists

Explaining her side of the story she wrote:  'On Saturday morning at around 9am I was driving behind a group of 
cyclists riding 3 a breast when I attempted to overtake at a clear 
point.  As I did so, a fourth cyclist also tried to get ahead of the others leading to a near collision.

'I then shouted out of my open window ;you're going to cause a crash 
riding like that.

'The cyclist caught up with me. He began hammering on my roof. And spitting at me as he shouted through my window "what's your f****** problem with cyclists?

'Then there was a brief collision in which nobody was hurt. Not a "hit 
and run". This could equally have been caused by him cycling into me.

'I did not lose a wing mirror it was merely pushed in. I appreciate how my tweet may have been misinterpreted.

'Nobody was injured during the incident, there was no impact on the cyclist as he continued to scream abuse as he rode off!'

The other individual involved has not come forward.

MailOnline has made several attempts to contact the Twitter user for comment and the Metropolitan Police says it is unable to confirm the incident was reported to them.

Accountancy trainee Emma Way's boasts about having knocked a cyclist off his bike and through a hedge on Twitter made national news.

Collision: Emma Way (left) tweeted she 
'definitely knocked a cyclist off his bike earlier'. Toby Hockley 
(right), 29, came forward as the cyclist involved in the collision and alleged he was 'lucky to be alive' following the crash

Confession: This tweet by user EmmaWay20 was met with shock and prompted an investigation by Norfolk police

Writing under the name @emmaway20, she tweeted: ‘Definitely knocked a cyclist off his bike earlier – I have right of way he doesn’t even pay road tax! #bloodycyclists’.

After police tracked her down she was charged with driving without due care and attention and failing to stop after an accident.

She also has to answer a charge of failing to report the accident after the incident in Rockland All Saints, Norfolk on May 19, and will appear in court this month.
