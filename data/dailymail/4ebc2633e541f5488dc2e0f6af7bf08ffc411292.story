It was the first lighthouse to be powered by electricity and could be seen by ships from 26 miles away.

So it is only fitting that Souter Lighthouse, one of the most iconic on the British coastline, gets a well-deserved spruce-up.

A team will set about giving the impressive structure a spring clean in a job that is expected to last most of the summer, and, judging from these incredible pictures, it is not hard to see why.

Intricate job: Hundreds of glass prisms need cleaning in Souter Lighthouse, South Tyneside. It was the world's first lighthouse to be powered by electricity

Iconic: The lighthouse is one of the most recognisable on the British coastline and was first opened in the 1871

Picturesque: The famous structure is situated in the village of Marsden, South Tyneside

The lighthouse was built due to the dangerous reefs directly under the water in the surrounding area. In one year alone - 1860 - there were 20 shipwrecks

With broken glass to repair and corroded paint to gloss over, the team face quite a task to restore the structure to its former glory.

Located in the village of Marsden, South Tyneside, It opened in 1871 and was decommissioned in 1988, before the National Trust acquired it and opened it to the public in 1990.            

The clean-up comes ahead of a special event on June 22 when the cliff-tops at Souter will witness a large-scale performance devised by artists Lise Autogena and Joshua Portway.

The Foghorn Requiem celebrates the passing of the foghorn from the British coastal landscape and into maritime heritage with a musical performance. 

It will involve an armada of vessels positioned offshore, the Souter Lighthouse Foghorn and on-shore musicians.  

Nick Dolan, Souter Lighthouse property 
manager, said work was being carried out on metalwork and glass panes 
throughout the historic building.                                

Vital: The lighthouse stopped ships crashing on what was one of the rockiest and most dangerous stretches of coastline on the North Sea

He said: 'It's especially important to get us pristine for the visitor over May half-term and the summer.                                            

'As ever with a historic property like this it's all go to make sure we are looking pristine.'
