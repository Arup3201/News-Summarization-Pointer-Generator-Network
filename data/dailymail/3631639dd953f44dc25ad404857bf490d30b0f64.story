A secretary who hurled racist abuse at fellow passengers on a Tube train while drunk had brought shame to Britain, a judge said yesterday.

Jacqueline Woodhouse, 42, was jailed for 21 weeks for her foul-mouthed tirade. She snarled at shocked commuters seated beside her: ‘I used to live in England and now I live in the United Nations.’

Woodhouse’s champagne-fuelled rant was recorded by a passenger, who posted the seven-minute clip on YouTube where it caused a sensation.

Vile: A child in the Central Line carriage looks on as Jacqueline Woodhouse hurls abuse at other passengers

Racist ranter Jacqueline Woodhouse, left, 42, arrives at Westminster Magistrates' Court yesterday to face sentencing - she was jailed for 21 weeks. The expletive-laden rant at passengers on the Central line in January was filmed by Galbant Singh Juttla, right, who also attended court.

At Westminster Magistrates’ Court, the
 judge also gave Woodhouse an anti-social behaviour order banning her 
from travelling on the Underground or the Docklands Light Railway while 
drunk for five years after it emerged that she had been fined for a 
similar rant on the DLR in 2008.

District Judge Michael Snow said of 
the video clip capturing her latest outburst: ‘Anyone viewing that would
 feel a deep sense of shame that our fellow citizens could be subject to
 such behaviour.’

The seven-minute clip was captured by 
fellow passenger Galbant Singh Juttla who was making his way home from a
 funeral at the time.

He became distressed by Woodhouse racially abusing a black woman who had bumped into her accidentally.

Today at Westminster Magistrates’ 
Court in central London, district judge Michael Snow sentenced her to 21
 weeks behind bars - but she will be eligible for release in just over 
10 weeks.

Previously the court was told that 
Woodhouse had drunk an 'unknown' quantity of champagne at a retirement 
party before getting on the Tube at 11pm.

Foul-mouthed: Woodhouse was caught on camera making racist remarks as she travelled on the Underground

Woodhouse, of Romford in Essex, admitted causing harassment alarm and distress to Mr Juttla earlier this month.

In the video which was played in court
 earlier this month, the clip begins with Woodhouse shouting in a thick 
Essex accent about 'foreign s*** heads'.

She turns to her passengers and asks: 'Where do you come from? Where do you come from? Where do you come from?

'I would like to know if any of you are illegal? I am sure like 30 per cent of you are.'

She then turns on the Pakistani man 
sitting next to her, who is singing his national anthem, and threatens 
to 'punch him in the face.'

'I wouldn’t mind if you loved our country,' she adds.

She then turns to Mr Juttla's camera, as he assures her he would rather be listening to his music than to her.

Woodhouse ignores the anger of other passengers as she continues her aggressive seven-minute tirade

'Oh look he’s filming, hello,' she says. 'Hello government.'

She goes on: 'Why don’t you tell me where you’re from?'

He replies: 'I am British.'

She gets her phone out of her black handbag and looks as if she is filming him too.

Mr Juttla warns her: 'Watch what you are saying.'

She replies: 'I used to live in England and now I live in the United Nations.'

As he tells her to keep her mouth 
shut, informing her that she has had too much to drink, she becomes 
extremely agitated and starts screaming.

'It’s not your country anyway so what’s your problem?' she yells. 'It’s been overtaken by people like you.'

The court heard that Mr Juttla decided to film Woodhouse after she started berating an unidentified black female.

She then sat down between two men and began another barrage of abuse.

Speaking after Woodhouse was jailed, 
Mr Juttla from Ilford, Essex said: 'This sends a message to her and 
other people like her not to carry on.

'I don't accept that I am not British and I am certainly not unemployed.

'I think the judge made the right decision, although maybe he could have given her a bit longer.'

Appalling behaviour: The court was told that Woodhouse had drunk an 'unknown' quantity of champagne at a retirement party before getting on the Tube at 11pm

Mr Juttla, a single father-of-two added: 'I was pretty shocked, and I don't want to go through anything like this again.

'I was born in this country, and I don't accept any of this behaviour.'

Rebecca Lee, defending Woodhouse, said
 she was 'deeply ashamed' of her behaviour but claimed she was often 
anxious on the tube due to terrorist events of 2005.

Ms Lee asked that a community order be
 considered and stressed her client would be willing to attend a 
diversity awareness and prejudice training course.

She added: 'She is horrified to see it
 (the clip) and offers her very sincere apologies in particular to the 
individuals involved but also to all of those on the train that day and 
the others who are many who have seen this clip online.

'She is dismayed not only for those 
who were present but also because she has friends and family members who
 are black and Asian.'

Ms Lee also explained her client 
recognised her actions were linked to heavy alcohol consumption, adding 
she had sought help from her GP and counselling since the incident.

In addition the court heard that Woodhouse had lost her job and was now claiming benefits.

Ms Lee concluded: 'She is a person who has a great deal more to be said about her than what is reflected on those video clips.'

But Judge Snow insisted the offence merited a custodial sentence.

'She threatened violence against more than one person. It took place over a prolonged period.

'Those who were not frightened 
admirably challenged her, on occasions trying to deflate her grossly 
offensive behaviour with humour.

'Her appalling behaviour went beyond 
that which I have described, the language making it clear it was 
motivated by hostility to her fellow passengers who were not white 
British.'

He refused to give Woodhouse any 
credit for changing her plea to guilty the day before the trial, 
claiming the witnesses had already suffered 'inevitable worry'.

He also said he found it hard to accept the sincerity of her shame.

Woodhouse, who was said to be in a 
'loving' relationship with her partner of 12 years, was supported in 
court by one of her sisters and a niece.

Spate of incidents: Police took Emma West into custody in December after a video (pictured) appeared on the internet showing a woman apparently abusing tram passengers

The publicity and attention to her 
case was said to have taken a 'considerable toll' on her mental health 
and she was prescribed medication for depression.

She appeared to show no emotion as she was led from the dock.

She attended court today wearing a black and white floral dress and dark sunglasses.

As she walked along the pavement, arm-in-arm with a woman dressed in a suit, she held a large black umbrella over her face.

The prosecutor also told the court 
that Woodhouse had been convicted of an identical rant on a Docklands 
Light Railway train in December 2008 for which she was fined.

Before officers asked Mr Juttla to take the video down, it had been watched 21,000 times.

Since duplicates have been made, it has been watched by hundreds of thousands of people.

The video emerged after a spate of 
similar clips were uploaded on to the internet. Emma West was charged 
with a racially aggravated public order offence in connection with an 
incident on a tram in December.

Another video called 'Welcome to London' showed a woman holding a pink rose on the London Underground as she abused passengers.

Another was of a drunk woman who tried
 to punch a black passenger on a London bus, but ended up falling over 
herself then being thrown into the street.

Woodhouse, of Romford, Essex, admitted racially aggravated intentional harassment.
