Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein has compared the  attack on French satire magazine Charlie Hebdo to the Kristallnacht in Nazi Germany.

The 62-year-old said the Charlie Hebdo attack and the hostage taking at a kosher supermarket in Paris last week 'draws a parallel to the horrors of the Nazis'.

Weinstein also appeared to be defending the US's sometimes controversial anti-terror measures, writing that we 'must sympathise with the Secret Service' even though there will be 'casualties'. 

Film exec Harvey Weinstein, pictured at last night's Golden Globes After Party with Taylor Swift, Este Haim, Jaime King, and Lorde, has compared the Paris attacks to the Nazi attacks against Jews during WWII

In a column for entertainment-trade magazine Variety, the film producer and executive, who was raised in a Jewish family in New York, writes: 'The tragedy in France is a stunning blow against freedom of speech and freedom of joy. 

'It draws a parallel to the horrors of the Nazis and their mad attempt at Kristallnacht to destroy books. 

'These are the works of fanatics - irrational thinking and scapegoating to compensate for misappropriated ideas. 

This has become a fight, good versus evil. This is a time for nations to unite, to share information and realize we live in a world where technology has evened the score and made the bad guys even more dangerous.'

Harvey Weinstein, pictured last night with wife and Georgina Chapman, also defended the war on terror

In defence of the war on terror, he continued: 'Now we have to use our technology and share things to make the good guys better, more capable, more efficient. 

'No one's talking about torture or the violation of human rights, but for God's sake we have to sympathize with our Secret Service and the other organizations of men and women protecting our safety daily. 

'We have to know there will be mistakes and casualties along the way, but we the people have to support those who protect us, more than ever.

'Let the humor, the wisdom, of Charlie Hebdo live, by us winning the war that they fought on the pages of their beautiful newspaper. 

'Laughter and satire will never disappear, and will always be the most effective tools for a free world.

Weinstein's column was published the day after one of the surviving Charlie Hebdo cartoonists said the publication 'vomit on all these people who suddenly say they are our friends'.

Bernard Holtrop, who uses the pen name Willem, was not in the office during the massacre on Wednesday which killed eight of his colleagues and four other victims.

'It really makes me laugh,' he told the Dutch newspaper Volkskrant.

'A few years ago, thousands of people took to the streets in Pakistan to demonstrate against Charlie Hebdo. They didn't know what it was. Now it's the opposite.'

Jihadist brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi shot dead eight members of staff and many of the magazine's top cartoonists, in the attack against Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday.

Editor Stephane Charbonnier, known as Charb, a guest editor, a maintenance worker and two police officers were also gunned down.

The pair were killed during a stand-off between police on the outskirts of the city on Friday after they took refuge in a printworks.
