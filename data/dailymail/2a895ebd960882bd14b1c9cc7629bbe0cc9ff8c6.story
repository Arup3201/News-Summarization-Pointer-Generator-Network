A mother has shared a heartbreaking photo diary of her terminally ill daughter's life as she vows to make wishes come true for other dying children. 

When Emma Whitfield was told her young daughter, Evie Kean, had just months to live, she was determined to fit a lifetime of memories into whatever time they had left together. 

She didn't ask Evie to write a bucket list because she did not want her child to know she was dying, so she instead asked the eight-year-old to list all the things she would do if she were the Queen – and then secretly set to work making them happen. 

Made her dreams come true: Emma, pictured with Evie, who passed away peacefully in January, says the happy memories of fulfilling Evie's wishes give her some comfort 

Evie's wishes included meeting boy band One Direction, visiting Legoland and owning her own dog. 

And when she died 10 months later, in January this year, mother of three Emma had ticked off all the items on the 'secret bucket list' without her daughter ever knowing it existed. 

Now Emma, a dinner lady at Evie's old primary school in Hull, says that thanks to various charities, she has a lifetime of memories to cherish. 

'My daughter was dying but making all her dreams come true made her so happy and that to me is priceless,' says Emma, 32. 'Asking her to write a bucket list would have been awful so instead I managed to get her to tell me without her knowing how ill she was.'

Shock diagnosis: There was no indication that anything was wrong until Evie fainted at school in February 2013 and it was eventually revealed she had an inoperable brain tumour and had only months to live 

Puppy love: The day before her ninth birthday in May, Evie was given a dog she named Lucy

There was no indication that anything was wrong until Evie fainted at school in February 2013. When she came round slurring, staff feared she had suffered a stroke and called an ambulance. Emma, who was working as a PA at the time, raced to the hospital. 

She says: 'I was terrified but when I got there Evie was sat up in A&E, laughing and smiling. The only thing I noticed was that her speech sounded a bit babyish.'

Doctors at Leeds General Infirmary decided to run tests and an MRI scan came back with devastating results. Evie had a large tumour on her brain stem which was later found to be cancerous.

Two weeks after Evie had fainted, while she lay in a hospital bed surrounded by family, doctors took Emma and her mother Marjorie, 76, into a side room and explained that the tumour was inoperable. 

Royal treatment: Emma got the chance to meet some of her Disney heroes in the months after her diagnosis 

Happy memories: Evie, right with her siblings Lottie, four and Riley, three, was delighted by the fact she didn't have to queue up to meet the characters when the family went to Disneyland Paris to fulfill one of her wishes 

Family pulled together: Evie's grandfather paid for the whole family to visit Disneyland Paris in between Evie's chemotherapy

Evie had just months to live. Emma says: 'I was so shocked I ran outside. I just couldn't believe what I was hearing. But then I composed myself because I needed to get back to Evie and make sure she was OK.'

And that evening, after discussing what to do, Emma and Evie's stepfather, Shane Gray – who are also parents to Lottie, four and Riley, three – decided not to tell Evie she was dying. 

Emma says: 'Evie was a worrier and I couldn't put that on her shoulders. It would have frightened her.' 

Star pupil:  Evie continued to go to school because she didn't want to fall behind, especially in her favourite subject maths

Dream trips: Visiting Hamley's toy-store (left) and Legoland (right) were two of the things listed by Emma 

Instead Emma gently explained to Evie that she was poorly and the doctors were trying to make her better. 'She seemed happy with that.' 

But that left Emma wanting to make her girl's dreams come true without asking her to write a bucket list. 

'I realised the only way I could do it would be if I tricked her into making it by asking her what she would do if she could do anything in the world. 

'My heart was breaking because I knew what I was really asking her but Evie's face just lit up at the question. 

Poignant party: On Evie's ninth - and last - birthday she had her dream of an ice-skating party granted 

Heartbreaking decision: Emma and her partner chose not to tell Evie, pictured here with siblings Lottie and Riley, that she was dying 

'I could see her mind racing as she came up with all these wonderful ideas.' 

Evie wanted to have an ice-skating birthday party, visit Disneyland and Legoland, see a West End show, go to the zoo and Hamley's toy store plus own a dog and rabbit and meet her beloved boy band One Direction. 

While Evie started an intensive 30-session course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy to try to extend her life, Emma quit her job and started fundraising to make her wishes come true. 

She held parties, bake sales, sold wristbands and was nominated for grants from charities who assist families of terminally ill children. 

The first wish to be granted was by One Direction who sent a film clip, holding up a message: 'Dear Evie, Get well soon, Love One Direction.' 

It arrived in April, a month after the terminal diagnosis was given. 

Animal lover: Emma quit her job to help grant her daughter's wishes, which included going to the zoo

Strong: Emma said she always tried to keep a brave face for Evie 

Emma says: 'I tried to arrange a meeting with them but they were on tour and instead offered to do a message. I told Evie something special was coming in the post. She was thrilled when she saw what it was.

'We watched it in her hospital bed about 500 times. She was over the moon that they knew who she was.' 

Then the day before her ninth birthday in May, Evie was given a Lhasa Apso dog she named Lucy – another tick. 

Emma says: 'She had always wanted one so she couldn't stop smiling.' 

The following day another wish came true when she had an ice skating birthday party for her friends. 

'Evie was too weak to skate after the first hour and had to be pulled in a sledge on the ice. She still loved every minute and was calling out for me to pull her faster. 

Brave and beautiful: Despite the chemotherapy causing her to gain weight, making her a little self-conscious, Emma says Evie was happy to have her mother taking pictures of her experiences  

'I had to hold back tears but I wanted every minute to be a joy because I knew it was her last birthday,' says Emma. 

Then Evie's grandfather paid for them to visit Disneyland Paris.

Emma recalls: 'Evie made us laugh because she worked out that as she was in a wheelchair she didn't have to queue to meet the characters. She felt like a superstar.' 

Next Evie was taken to London to see hit show Mamma Mia! and the following month they took Evie to Legoland.

Snow fun: In December last year the family took Evie to visit Lapland and meet Santa, granting her last wish 

Loss: Heartbroken Emma has taken comfort from the happiness of her daughter's last months

Legacy: Emma is now launching a charity - Evie's Wishes - to help all terminally ill children's dreams come true

Emma says: 'She had lost a bit of hair and had started to gain weight because of her chemotherapy and was feeling self-conscious. But Evie was still happy for me to take lots of pictures.' 

In between the wishes Evie continued to go to school because she didn't want to fall behind, especially in her favourite subject, maths. 

'I didn't have the heart to tell her it didn't matter any more. It mattered to Evie so she kept going,' says Emma. Between June and October she had a second course of chemo and in December last year they visited Lapland to meet Santa.

But after Christmas the child's health went rapidly downhill. And when in early January she complained that she felt too poorly to go to school, Emma knew the end was coming. 

She says: 'Evie never wanted to miss school - but she still insisted on going to buy me a present even though my birthday was a month away. It made me wonder if she knew. 

'But soon she was in pain so nurses came and fitted a morphine drip.' 

Days later Evie died at home, holding her mother's hand. 

Heartbroken Emma took comfort in the happiness of her daughter's last months. 

She says: 'The memories we made are what get me through each day. Lottie and Riley miss her. They think she lives in the clouds. It helps that they talk about her'

Emma is now launching a charity - Evie's Wishes - to help all terminally ill children's dreams come true. 'I want to make sure that can happen for any other family. Evie's wishes made her happy - and as a parent of a dying child that is all you can ask for.'
