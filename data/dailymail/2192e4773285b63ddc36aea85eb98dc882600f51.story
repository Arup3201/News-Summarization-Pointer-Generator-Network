A video clip claiming to show a naked man climbing down the facade of Buckingham Palace on a bed sheet has gone viral on the internet. 

The video show a couple of tourists standing on Constitution Hill, outside Green Park as the Changing of the Guard is taking place. 

As the video zooms towards Buckingham Palace, it appears as if a naked man has clambered out of a window onto a bed sheet and attempts to lower himself to the ground.  

These are the amazing scenes as a naked man apparently climbs from the window of Buckingham Palace

The daredevil is making his escape just as the Changing of the Guard is taking place 

Two tourists seem almost oblivous to the ongoing drama as they wait for the soldiers to pass by 

Despite a naked man just yards away the soldiers seem completely unaware of what is happening over their shoulder. 

The man is seen slowly lowering himself down the rope made from bed sheets over the course of several seconds. 

However, after about ten feet, the man loses his grip and plummets to the ground some 20 feet below him. 

Yet, despite the incident, nobody in the crowd or any of the soldiers appear to react.  

However, the 45 second video is believed to be an elaborate hoax.

When contacted, Buckingham palace declined to comment on the video.

The Metropolitan Police said they have not received any reports of a naked man dangling from a Buckingham Palace window. 

The London Ambulance Service said they have not received any calls to treat a naked man suffering from injuries sustained from a fall from a rope made of bed sheets.

The man appears to have almost made it as he passes a lower window which has the blinds closed 

The man, who appears to be only wearing his left sock, now seems to be in trouble

Shockingly, the man plummets to his doom after he loses his grip on the improvised climbing rope
