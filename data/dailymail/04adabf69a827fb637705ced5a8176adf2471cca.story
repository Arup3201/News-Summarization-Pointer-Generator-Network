It has been revealed the former Playboy playmate found dead this week in Los Angeles was binging on drugs and alcohol hours before her death, according to police.

Cassandra Lynn Hensley consumed large amounts of cocaine and champagne the night she died, police sources told TMZ. She was found dead in a bath tub the following morning.

The woman wasn't feeling well when she landed Tuesday LAX, but went forward with a fitting and a photo shoot before returning to the home of a celebrity photographer she was staying with, the gossip site reported.

The model and the photographer 'had sex and did large amounts of coke and guzzled lots of champagne,' TMZ reported.

They both passed out around 11 p.m., but the photographer awoke a few hours later to find the woman submerged in the bathtub. He was not able to resuscitate her, according to the site.

He called police and though the 
call has not been released, TMZ reports the friend indicated that it may
 have been due to an overdose

First responders were not able to revive Ms Hensley when they arrived at the scene.

TMZ first reported the death on Thursday. No foul play is suspected in the woman's tragic death.

She
 was raised in Ferron, Utah and attended high school where she 
reportedly moved around a lot and got into some trouble, prompting her 
to be kicked out of several schools.

Known best as 'Miss February 2006', Ms 
Hensley has continued her modeling career and was most recently named 
'Angel of the Month' by Philadelphia's Metropolis Nights magazine.

'She was just a nice, outgoing girl who was a little wild,' Aaron Arrington told MailOnline.

Mr
 Arrington went to the same junior high as Ms Hensley and though they 
have been out of touch for some time, he told MailOnline that she had a 
somewhat difficult time growing up.

'She was a nice girl but I think she didn't have a really stable childhood,' he said. 'She was a little rowdy.'

Eventually she moved into the famed Playboy mansion and was living there around the time that she was made a centerfold.

In her 
most recent interview, she made it very clear that she is active in the 
glamor modeling industry and did not let 2006 career highlight put an 
end to her aspirations.

Making a name for herself: In recent months, Cassandra Lynn was working as a hostess at events

'Yes, there is life after Playboy, I have been a part of many great experiences: travel shows, magazine covers, and of course giving advice to young impressionable girls who think they need to act a certain way for a chance to be a model (classy not slutty),' she said to Metropolitian Nights.

Cassandra, whose nickname was 'Butterfly' for the five butterfly tattoos she had on her body, had been working in recent months as an event hostess. 

She recently bought a motorcycle and 
had been learning how to ride it in the months leading up to her death, 
making her decision to co-headline an autoshow afterparty with a fellow 
former playmate in May of last year even more fitting.

She did the same for a golf event outside of Washington, D.C. in September.

Home life: She recently dyed her hair dark brown and regularly updated with selfies and pictures with her dog

The five-foot five-inch model still has a biography on Playboy's archives, wherein she described herself as a hopeless romantic making February the best month for her centerfold debut.

'I love Valentine’s Day. And candy. Especially conversation hearts,' she told the site.

She was active on social media and had more than 7,800 followers on Twitter.

She arranged for her feed to update daily with her horoscope so the latest message posted to her account was set live a day after she was found dead.

'Unspoken obligations prevent you from doing what you wish today,' it read.
