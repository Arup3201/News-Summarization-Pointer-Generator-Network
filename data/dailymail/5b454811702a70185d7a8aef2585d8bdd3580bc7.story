The micro-housing boom taking the U.S. by storm has come under attack from residents who believe they will make cities too overcrowded.

Residents in Seattle are among those fighting back against thousands of tiny apartment homes being built in response to demand for affordable housing.

The 10ft by 10ft 'Apodments', around the same size as a generous parking space, have become increasingly popular in the city in recent years.

Judy Green, 67 says she enjoys living in her 10ft by 10ft micro-apartment in Seattle

Kris King spreads his arms as he shows off his Seattle flat: Even Mr King was initially shocked by the size of the apartment he rented near downtown, which is roughly the size of a large parking space

Not great for dinner parties... King, 36, works as a counselor at a downtown Seattle homeless service centre and pays $750 for his unit, roughly 120 square feet, which includes utilities and Internet

Compact: Mr King stands in the kitchen, which is adjacent to the bed which is next to an open closet

For as little as $500 (£320) a month renters can get a one-bedroom apartment and access to a shared kitchen, often with utilities, furnishings and Internet included.

Most are occupied by young urban singles, retirees who prefer city living, students and others looking to downsize.

Judy Green, 67, lives in an $850 a month apodment which features a sleeping loft, a private toilet and shower, a kitchenette with a sink, fridge and granite countertop, a skylight, two windows and a sliding-glass door to a small private deck.

She is also across the hall from the shared rooftop with a view of the Space Needle.'I think this is a wonderful thing,' she said.

Campaigners say apodment blocks like this are overpopulating and driving out established families

Micro-housing projects are proliferating in many of America's biggest cities including New York, Seattle and San Francisco.

But many established residents are unhappy at the pace of expansion.

Since 2006, Seattle has permitted 48 micro-housing projects. If all are built, they would provide living quarters for about 2,300 people.

Neighborhood
activists estimate that 19 of the developments already are renting or 
are being built within just one square-mile area.

Campaigners say the micro-apartments crowd too many people together, are not compatible with some neighbourhoods, do not encourage people to put down roots, and circumvent planning laws.

'They’re maxing out what they can do under the land use code,' said Patrick Tompkins, who lives in the Capitol Hill, where some projects have replaced family homes, sometimes without much warning.

The tiny units has been around for at least three decades, but micro-apartments have taken off in the last three years, said Bryan Stevens with Seattle’s planning department.

'It’s really coincided with the recession. Apparently there’s pent-up demand,' he said.

Opponent Carl Winter said the projects are seeing older homes torn down to make way for people who may only stay for a few months.

'We’re not concerned with who these people are, but 
with how many there are. This is a massive increase in density,' he told the Seattle Times.

Smallest of them all? Eddie Rabon, 24, in his 'micro' apartment at West 47th Street, New York City, which he claims is just 55 square feet. New York is one of the cities where such micro-habitations are most popular

If they can make it there, they can make it anywhere: Zaarath and Christopher Prokop - and their two cats - live in what they believe the smallest apartment in the city, a 175-square-foot 'microstudio' in Morningside Heights

Mr Winter, is among those lobbying 
Seattle City Council for a moratorium. He believes the city is providing
an incentive for builders by not enforcing the normal regulations.

Builders are claiming they have only 
six or eight kitchens, the definition of a dwelling unit, to bypass the 
need for a full design and environmental review usually required for a 
large-scale development. 

But
conversely, they are using the total number of sleeping units, 56 or 64
for example, to take advantage of a tax exemption scheme by reserving 
some for low-income workers.

Council member Tim Burgess said the city is missing out on a substantial amount of money in lost tax revenue.

'What’s
troubling is the city looks like it’s twisting the rules to favour 
developers, and that’s not appropriate,' he told the Seattle Times.

These 300sq feet microapartments were given the go ahead in San Francisco recently

Cosy and comfortable... Miss Grundberg models the fold-out bed in the studio, which was showcased in an exhibition dubbed 'Making Room: New Housing for New Yorkers'

Perfect for minimalists: The closet is pictured inside the concept apartment, which was unveiled by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in January

Don't leave a mess: With such limited surface space and a tiny sink, one imagines that washing up in this kitchen would not be a chore to be relished

Fold-out everything: Miss Grundberg prepares to set up a folding chair to go with the folding table in this space-efficient dwelling
