Some will take to PlayStation to fill in the down time. Others will be downloading TV hits such as Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones. And their manager, well known for his literary tastes, will in all likelihood curl up with  a John Updike or Philip Roth novel.

But however England’s 23 players choose to pass the time between training and performing at the World Cup in Brazil next month, manager Roy Hodgson says he is not expecting to hear complaints from his squad about boredom or homesickness.

With 29 days to go until the squad depart for their Miami training base before moving on to Rio, and with the England squad to be announced on Monday week, Hodgson has sent the clearest message yet regarding the attitude and behaviour he expects from his team in Brazil.

Don't you dare! England boss Roy Hodgson doesn't expect England players to complain of boredom

Bad attitude: Hodgson believes that complaining of boredom during the World Cup is a 'silly excuse'

Hodgson’s law means there will be no room for sulking or moodiness during the World Cup campaign.

Despite the fact that the previous campaign in South Africa was marred by grumbles about the  remote training ground in Rustenburg, where players had little to do, Hodgson will have no sympathy for any squad members who suggest they are unhappy.

That is partly because England have reversed their policy of using secluded training bases and are staying in the beachside Royal Tulip Hotel in Rio and training at Urca Military base, beneath the landmark Sugarloaf Mountain.

Principally, though, it is because Hodgson does not buy into the idea that players cannot cope with long periods of enforced inactivity between training and games.

‘It’s a complete nonsense,’ said Hodgson. ‘It’s one of those silly excuses that people use. You really cannot have that attitude.

‘I don’t think it’s our job to keep the players occupied. I think when you sign up for the World Cup you sign up for the World Cup as it’s going to be.

1 Does he go with 107-cap Ashley Cole (below, right) or the youthful verve of Luke Shaw, 19 (right), voted the best left-back in the country?

2 With Kyle Walker out, does Hodgson bring in Kyle Naughton or Nathaniel Clyne as back-up for Glen Johnson — or take seven defenders and trust Phil Jones or Chris Smalling to step in?

3 Could John Stones squeeze in after an impressive few months at Everton?

4 In midfield, does Hodgson go for Michael Carrick to steady the ship or Ross Barkley to add to his attacking options?

5 Up front, does he pick Rickie Lambert — if only for the fact he has never missed a penalty — or give Jermain Defoe, now with Toronto FC, one last hurrah?

‘You know from May 19, hopefully through to the final, you’re going to be away, you’ll be with another group of players and  maybe there will be only one training session a day,  so there will be a lot of  free time.

‘You’re not going to be with your wife, you’re going to see your kids. This is something you sign up for. And once you sign up for that, you shouldn’t then be saying: “Oh, I’m missing my family; oh I’m bored. What can you do to help me?” Because there’s nothing we can do to help you.’

England have lurched between polar opposite approaches to the base camp in past World Cup finals.

In Germany 2006, they resembled a travelling circus, when wives and girlfriends took over Baden-Baden, with daily parties and regular contact with players making England a laughing stock to other nations.

Spartan: England players complained of boredom under Fabio Capello's strict regime in South Africa 2010

Current England coach Gary Neville was part of that squad and criticised the arrangements.

In South Africa, manager Fabio Capello picked one of the most remote training grounds possible in Rustenburg, with all facilities on site, so there was no need or even any temptation to go off site — although for several players that proved too stifling and lacking  in stimulation.

At Euro 2012 under Hodgson, the FA instigated  a policy of staying in city-centre hotels and allowing players more freedom. Squad members were regularly seen strolling through Krakow and eating out at nearby restaurants.

In Rio, as well as the usual array of PlayStation games, table tennis, pool and TV downloads, players will be allowed to unwind over a round of golf on the 18-hole course adjacent to their Royal Tulip base. ‘We’ll put on the same as every other team,’ said Hodgson.

Right on course: A round of golf is likely to be a popular pastime among players in Brazil

‘There will be leisure activities, they’ll get free time in the afternoon. If they want to have a game of golf, listen  to their music or watch a video on TV, they can.

‘But what we can’t reproduce is that you go to training in the morning and then you go home to your wife and family and do whatever you want to do  for the rest of the day. It’s  a World Cup. So I’ve got no truck with that whatsoever.

‘If I got the 30 players together and told them, “Right, we’re going to be living together, we’re not going to be training every minute of the day, there’ll be free time and you’ve got to find a way of using that free time. Out of you 30 here, put your hands up if you don’t fancy that?” — there wouldn’t be one.

Get on with it! The England manager argues that players must have boredom to deal with in everyday life

‘They’re all going to say, “Yeah, we understand that, we want to go. It’s been my dream. All my life I’ve dreamed it”.

‘Unfortunately, no one will say that in advance, and then some of them will go to the World Cup and play badly and say to you guys, “I was bored”. And you’ll write, “Poor fella”.

‘It’s like a soldier signing up for the army, then saying, “I’m a bit bored sitting around these barracks every day with nothing to do”. They must have plenty of boredom in their lives but they cope with it.’
