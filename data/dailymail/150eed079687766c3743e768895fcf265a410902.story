This is the moment a homeless man whose frostbitten fingers have been left deformed after years of living on the street stunned customers in a second hand store with his god given talent for music.

David Allen Welsh grew up riding on trains and flitting between homeless shelters in Iowa and North and South Dakota after losing his home at the age of six.

After settling in the Pacific Northwest ten years ago, the 50-year-old has been visiting Second Hand Solutions in Vancouver, Washington, twice a month for the last year to play the piano.

David Welsh, 50, has been visiting the second hand store in Vancouver twice a month for the past year to play the piano

Mr Walsh recalls teaching himself how to play the instrument on borrowed pianos at homeless shelters throughout his childhood.

Despite bringing classical music enthusiasts to tears with his performances, the man cannot read a single note.

'I showed a video of him playing to a piano teacher and she pointed out immediately that he's using his left hand as a primary and his right hand to play the melody,' said Rebecca Gore, the store's assistant manager.

'I don't know how to play music, but I like what I hear in my head,' the 50-year-old told ABC news.

'Sometimes I don't even know what key I'm pushing. My eyes aren't even open, I'm just letting the music play the music.'

James Maynard, a customer who lives next door to the store, welled up when he heard the man playing.

The man has been left with numb, frostbitten fingers after spending so many years on the streets

'He started to play and I choked on my coffee and it started coming out my nose!' said the longtime classical music enthusiast.

'I had tears coming to my eyes when I saw his fingers go down one end of the piano to the other.'

Mr Welsh says sharing his gift has helped him through tough times, and that it's as though his fingers are moved by a divine power.

'My custom is to sit and close my eyes and say "Dad, do what you do, it's your gift,"' he said. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

'A lot of people in the room had the same spiritual experience.'
