Good news for consumers - Optus will pay customers who terminate contracts with  rivals up to $200 in an aggressive bid to claw back ground in the cut-throat mobile market.

Under a new offer launched on Sunday, people who abandon their existing contracts and move to 24-month Optus plans will have the money added to their plan's credit to help offset cancellation charges.

The move is timed to take advantage of the pre-Christmas influx of new smartphone models, such as the iPhone 6, which Apple is expected to unveil this week.

'It is a key period for consumers,' said Vicki Brady, Optus' customer chief.

'People don't want to have to wait out the last few months of their contract to get that latest smartphone.'

Customers eager to upgrade to newer models can earn extra credit on their new plan when they trade-in their existing phone.

The aggressive move is a notable departure from conventional price competition, but unsurprising given Optus' poor recent performance in the mobile space, said Telsyte senior analyst Foad Fadaghi.

Australia's second-biggest telco lost 126,000 mobile subscribers in the last financial year to Telstra, with the overall figure falling to 9.4 million.

Meanwhile, Telstra added close to one million new mobile subscribers as it reached a total of some 16 million, which includes non-smartphone users. Vodaphone has five million subscribers.  

'Telstra has been the fastest growing contracted vendor in the market,' Said Fadaghi.

'This is a shot across the bow.' 

But it also comes as Australians increasingly abandon high-value lock-in contracts and opt instead for flexible pay-as-you-go and prepaid plans, which allow for more frequent phone changes.

'This won't appeal to everyone,' Brady allowed.

'But it certainly appeals to a very big portion of the market who are still happy to take a contracted plan and get a brand new smartphone without having to pay for it outright.'

Fadaghi said Optus' rivals would likely launch aggressive counter strategies in the coming months.

'This is a win for consumers if we see increased competition around the launch of the new (Apple) handset (and) some of the barriers come down for switching,' Mr Fadaghi said.

The mobile phone sector is a multi-billion dollar industry, and according to News Corp Australia, to every three Australians there are four mobiles.
