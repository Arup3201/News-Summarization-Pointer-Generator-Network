The 'White Widow' Samantha Lewthwaite is being guarded by a squad of elite terrorists who are ready to kill anyone who goes near her, it was reported today.

The British-born Muslim convert is on the run after she was suspected of helping coordinate the September attack on a Nairobi shopping mall in which 67 people were killed.

Reports suggest she is now being protected by a band of loyal al-Qaeda fighters, who move her between locations on camel or donkey to avoid detection.

Mother-of-four Lewthwaite, 30, originally from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, is said to be one of the leading players in Somalia's radical al-Shabaab group, which is linked to al-Qaeda.

The Daily Mirror reported today she is 'prized' by the group and is being looked after by a well-trained band of men, who clothe their whole bodies apart from their eyes and have threatened locals not to come near them.

A colonel from the Somalian National Army told the paper: 'She is being protected by some of their best fighters. They are moving her all the time, sometimes by camel or donkey.'

The most recent sighting of the Briton is believed to have been when she moved by camel to Baidoa, where the Somali National Army is fighting a group of approximately 8,000 terrorists.

It is claimed she is now 'prized' among al Shabaab fighters, who are believed to have carried out more attacks in Kenya at the weekend

It was reported today that her group stay on the move to avoid a force of 10,000 troops sent to the troubled region by the UN.

Samantha Lewthwaite is the widow of 7/7 bomber 
Germaine Lindsay, who blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train between
 King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square stations.

She was the daughter of a former soldier before converting to Islam.

The British Muslim
 convert is linked to the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi in which 67 
people were killed, and is thought to be hiding in Somalia.

Interpol
 issued a 'Red Notice' warrant for her arrest shortly after the attacks 
for terrorist offences in Mombasa dating back to 2011.

The 29-year-old is
 the world's most wanted woman after being accused of allegedly ordering
 the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, 
and three others with links to al-Shabaab.

They are reportedly living in forests and caves and getting milk from nomadic farmers in the region.

It has been
 claimed Lewthwaite, the widow of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, is 
among those planning revenge attacks following the death of al-Qaeda 
leader Abubakar Shariff Ahmed.

Ahmed was 
killed by unidentified gunmen last month as he and a friend were walking
 from a court in Mombasa, Kenya to a nearby mosque.

Ahmed,
 who had denied meeting Lewthwaite, was suspected of helping more than 
100 Britons to join al-Shabaab, which carried out the Westgate Mall 
shootings in Kenya seven months ago.

Since his death, Kenya has seen a rise in the number of attacks, with a series of bombings over the last week.

Blasts
 in Nairobi and Mombasa killed seven people this weekend and, though 
they have not claimed responsibilty, al-Shabaab is suspected of being involved.

Deputy President William Ruto insisted his country has the situation under control yesterday.

He said: 'We have disrupted a lot of schemes of the terrorists in our country.

'We are on top of this situation. What you see are desperate kicks of a dying horse.'

The
 US Embassy in Nairobi told its citizens to avoid any travel to Monbasa 'for the time being' after attacks in the coastal city on Saturday.

Lewthwaite is believed to have fled Nairobi in Kenya to Somalia after attacks and was most recently spotted in Baidoa
