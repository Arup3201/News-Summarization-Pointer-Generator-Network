Roberto di Matteo played it low-key before the kick-off, keeping his distance from Chelsea personnel. 

There were touchline hugs for doctors Paco Biosca and Eva Carneiro as he ducked down the tunnel after completing a pre-match interview and a brief hand-slap with Jose Mourinho who waited for him by the end of the tunnel but the Schalke boss kept well clear of the players until after the game.

Petr Cech was back on the bench after starting in the last two European games.

But, the keen drummer would have appreciated the pre-match soundtrack, featuring plenty of Krautrock.

Di Matteo’s low key manner did not stop the 2,000 Chelsea fans singing his name in the 16th minute. Nice touch and he responded with a thumbs-up.

Next to the very shiny scalp of Di Matteo on the Schalke bench was the equally shiny scalp of his assistant Attilio Lombardo, once the manager of Crystal Palace.
