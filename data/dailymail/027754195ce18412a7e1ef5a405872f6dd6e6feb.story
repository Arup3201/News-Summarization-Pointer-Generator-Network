A New Jersey native and track star at an Ivy League University has been missing since Christmas and his family has blamed it on his deteriorating emotional state caused by the male enhancement supplements he was taking.

Timothy Hamlett, a track star at the University of Pennsylvania, has been missing since December 26, and his mother Katherine Hamlett has no idea is he is alive or dead.

Hamlett was last seen the day after Christmas wearing an Adidas track jacket, true religion jeans, and sneakers at around 6:30 p.m.

He allegedly lied to his parents and told them he was going to visit his friend nearby but then instead planned on visiting a friend in Manhattan.

He took a Jitney but hasn't been seen since entering Manhattan.

Hamlett’s mother and a neurologist confirmed in December that Timothy Hamlett's behavior had changed recently as a result of overuse of athletic supplements, reported CBS.

'Our son did not experience any issues until he started taking these supplements,' Katherine Hamlett told The Daily Beast.

'And people look at us cross-eyed and I know there’s a lot of skepticism. But if you look at the history he goes all the way through school—no issues whatsoever and then he starts taking these supplements and everything in his life, literally everything in his life changes.'

Teaneck New Jersey Police said that Hamlett probably entered a park near West 174th street after getting off the jitney because both his iPhone and wallet turned up in the hands of local kids playing there.

Changing behavior: 'After taking the cordyceps my son starting believing in these supplements and what he was doing,' said dad Archibald Hamlett who later said his son's behavior became 'schizophrenic'

At 2:24 a.m. on December 31, both of Hamlett’s parents received phone calls from a blocked number.

His mother said the phone calls were silent and that the police are currently trying to track the location of the blocked caller’s phone.

A subway booth clerk at a subway station on 157th Street told the Hamlett family that she sold Hamlett a subway card around 8:00 a.m. on Saturday morning.

She said she was confident it was him because he was not one of the regulars and she did not usually see young people at that hour of the morning.

Parents Archibald and Katherine Hamlett believe that they would know where their son was had he not taken the supplements he began purchasing in 2013 following a sports injury.

Pygeum, Cordyceps, and Ginseng Panax were among some of the herbal supplements Hamlett was taking, said his mother.

Hamlett was also taking Vitalikor Male Enhancement, Big Jim, and Twins Male Enhancement Huge Penis Enlargement.

'What you’re taking is anybody’s guess,' Paul Offit, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases and the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told The Daily Beast.

'You’re assuming what’s on the labels is in the bottles.'

Edgar Miller, deputy director of Johns Hopkins Institute for Clinical and Translational Science, told The Daily Beast that herbal supplements can possibly make a person crazy and cause kidney and liver failure.

'Do a fistful of herbs and spices and supplements cause a psychosis? I don’t know these particular supplements,' he said.

'It sounded like some of them might be hormonally active and then the question is can hormones cause problems like that? Possibly,' he said.

Hamlett's mother said that up until taking supplements that her son had a likable and warm personality and was known to make jokes.

'Something wasn’t right' his mother said.

'Now we’re looking at a person who is isolated. This was a supplement-induced psychosis.'

Hamlett began taking supplements after being injured in a race against Harvard in 2013.

'Someone from Harvard spiked him,' his mother added.

'I can remember him distinctly calling me saying ‘I got injured. They’re taking care of me. But I got spiked.'

Shortly after Hamlett was injured he began taking supplements like cordyceps, a fungus extracted from caterpillars in China.

When Hamlett's father asked his son why he was taking it he replied, 'It’s not banned.'

'After taking the cordyceps my son starting believing in these supplements and what he was doing,' said dad Archibald Hamlett.

'He had gone from high school running a two-minute 800-meter to almost three years of training in less than a year,' Hamlett's dad continued.

'Some of the ones where it’s dietary or male enhancement—someone of his age wouldn’t need that,' the father said.

'But if you look at the situation where you need stamina and strength for long distances—these things give you some get-up-and-go or more fight and determination,' he added.

Hamlett's dad said that his coach began adding pressure on him to perform which pushed him even further into his supplement addiction.

'He looked at Timothy as a prodigy and was expecting a lot out of him. And he was expecting a lot out of himself. That’s why he changed from the 400 to the 800. That’s a lot of pressure,' said his dad of the coach’s expectations.

Soon after taking supplements Hamlett's grades declined and the family said they ordered an MRI of his brain to determine if there were any cysts.

Hamlett's parents described his state as schizophrenic at times.

'He’s not engaging with his roommates. And he’s staying in the bathroom for long amounts of time. And talking to himself,' said his mother.

Hamlett's mother said her son's memory also began slipping.

'What’s your name? What’s your major?' his mother recalled her son asking a friend.

'Then later in the conversation he asks again, what’s your major?’'

Finally Hamlett's parents pulled him from the University of Pennsylvania and tried to get him help.

In May of 2014 Hamlett was charged in a 'vandalism binge' that included shattering windows in nine homes and three parked cars in Teaneck Township in May, according to NorthJersey.com.

In one vandalism case, an 18-year-old woman needed to get stitches after she was cut on the head by shattered glass when a brick was thrown through a window in her home.

Hamlett's backpack came back positive for 'brick residue.'

When asked if pending charges might cause Hamlett to run away, his lawyer Jason Foy said, 'this is not the case your run from.'

Hamlett's parents hope that someday their son will return safely so they can get him the help he needs.
