Louis van Gaal failed to get his first win as Manchester United manager after being held to a 1-1 draw with Sunderland.

United's Spanish playmaker Juan Mata opened the scoring before the Black Cats' £10 million summer signing Jack Rodwell equalised in the second-half.

Crock star: Jack Rodwell almost hurt himself while celebrating his equaliser against Manchester United

Rodwell has had his fitness problems in recent years and he very nearly had another celebrating his equaliser against Van Gaal’s team. 

The midfielder, who joined Sunderland from champions Manchester City over the summer, slipped before crashing down on his backside in front of the ecstatic home fans. His joyous team-mates quickly hauled him back to his feet and, thankfully, Rodwell was OK.

Here's one I made earlier: Referee Martin Atkinson (R) was able to recycle his vanishing spray

We had our first instance of vanishing spray being recycled. United had only just defended a free-kick from the right channel when Santiago Vergini seized upon the clearance only to be chopped down again by Ashley Young in exactly the same spot. 

Referee Martin Atkinson  merely had to ‘touch up’ his earlier effort.

We've heard of the Black Cats, but what about the white dogs? A pair of huskies — complete with Sunderland shirts and red and white ribbons — were spotted outside the ground before the game.

It’s just a shame Sunderland lacked the attacking bite to see off United, whose forward line was similarly toothless. United had 10 shots on goal, but could not add to Juan Mata’s 17th-minute opener.

In-house publications are often criticised for their blinkered view of proceedings. However you cannot level that accusation at Manchester United’s official Twitter feed.

Honesty is the best policy? Manchester United's Twitter feed gave a frank assessment of the game

For with 85 minutes on the clock they posted: ‘Time is running out at the Stadium of Light and, in truth, Sunderland look the more likely winners at the moment’. A stern-faced Van Gaal, watching from the dugout, would likely have shared that assessment.

Sunderland may have edged the contest but their wait for a win over United at the Stadium of Light in the Premier League will enter its 19th year next season. For while they broke an Old Trafford duck dating back to 1968 last season, they’re yet to beat United at home in the post-Roker Park era. 

Home disadvantage? Sunderland have not beaten United at the Stadium of Light in 19 years

The hosts had 11 shots on United’s goal and earned a glut of free-kicks in attacking areas but couldn’t find the goal to give them their first home league win over United since March 1997.
