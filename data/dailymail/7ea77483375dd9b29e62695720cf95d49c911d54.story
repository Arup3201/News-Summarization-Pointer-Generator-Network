Inter Milan want to take Cardiff midfielder Gary Medel on
loan with view to a permanent deal.

Inter are willing to offer £8million at the
end of next season for the 26-year-old who cost Cardiff £11m from Sevilla. 

Medel signed for the Welsh club last summer, and made 34 appearances in the Premier League last season.

Wanted: Inter are after Cardiff and Chile midfielder Gary Medel

Enforcer: The midfielder made 34 appearances for Cardiff in the Premier League last season

But his performances could not help the club avoid relegation.

He has most recently turned out for Chile at the World Cup, where his heroic displays helped his side progress from Group B - including a 2-0 victory over Spain.

But they eventually fell to Brazil in the second round, losing on penalties after the game finished 1-1.
