Not only has Fifty Shades of Grey brought BDSM to the mainstream, E.L. James' erotic novel and its film adaptation have inspired a bondage friendly dating app that is similar to Tinder - but kinkier.

Whiplr is a free location-based messaging app that discretely allows users to channel their inner Christian Grey by connecting them with people who share similar interests in BDSM or other fetishes.

'The inspiration comes directly from the kink community where people are looking for ways to find and meet other like-minded people,” Whiplr Chief Commercial Officer Daniel Sevitt told the The Daily Dot in an email.

Modern dating: The new Whiplr app for iOS and Android phones was released today and allows users to connect with potential BDSM play partners who have similar fetishes and kinks

He added: 'I think the genius of Fifty Shades of Grey was that it tapped into something that was already happening.'

According to the app's description, it is 'the world's first and only location-based messaging app to help you connect with potential play partners online or in person'.  

The free download, which was released today on iOS and Android, allows users to message, call and video chat their potential partners without ever having to leave the app's interface.

'Download today and embark on your personal "Fifty Shades of Grey" journey!' reads the app's description.

Most importantly the login remains anonymous and private, so users don't have to worry about Whiplr linking to their Facebook pages or sharing their personal information. 

In addition to the app's secure login, you can keep your messages and videos from falling into the wrong hands thanks to the app's ability to delete shared content from both your device and the Whiplr user to whom you sent it to. 

After joining, users are prompted to upload a photo and fill out a profile that includes gender, location, a 'kink category' and level of experience.

Preferences are broadly categorized by fashion, objects, behavior, materials, accessories, and sounds, and every experience level - including the merely curious - are welcome. 

And the truly shy can start a conversation by sending an animated 'Spark'. 

The free version of Whiplr has daily allotments, which allows users to browse up to 100 profiles, start up to 10 chat sessions, initiate three voice or video calls, send three 'Sparks' and swipe through 25 profiles over the course of 24 hours.

But for those who find themselves spending all their time on Whiplr, the restrictions can be lifted by purchasing monthly subscriptions, which range from $19.95 for a one month of service to $119.95 for a year. 

Of course, Fifty Shades of Grey has inspired more than just this a dating app.

Since the release of the trilogy's first book in 2012, companies have been motivated to cater to its fans by offering titillating hotel packages, as well as themed sex toys and lingerie. 

With two more films on the way, it was only a matter of time before a company found a way to help people meet their very own Christian Grey.
