Louis van Gaal won’t be daunted by taking over at Manchester United and is ‘relishing’ the opportunity to revive the club’s fortunes, according to his assistant Ryan Giggs.

The Dutchman will arrive at Old Trafford next week after he fulfils his World Cup commitments with Holland following Saturday’s Third Place Playoff against hosts Brazil.

Giggs has had limited contact with the 62-year-old during the tournament but insists that he cannot wait to take up his new role.

Incoming: Van Gaal will not be 'afraid of taking over' at Old Trafford but wants to win the league

Speaking at a press conference to 
announce Van Gaal’s first home game - a friendly against Valencia at Old 
Trafford on August 12 - Giggs said: ‘He’s a got a clear philosophy and he
 sticks to it.

'He won’t be afraid to take over Manchester United, he will relish it and look forward to it.

‘He has been at big clubs like Barcelona and Bayern Munich, and in my mind Manchester United is the biggest.

‘He is not scared about the challenge. He is not apprehensive. He can’t wait and he has got the experience.

‘It won’t be easy and it never is because the Premier League is a difficult league to win.

‘It’s disappointing for him that Holland went out (on Wednesday) but it’s been a fantastic campaign starting with a fantastic result no one could foresee to beat Spain 5-1.

‘To get to the semi finals of the World Cup is a great achievement. It has excited everyone. He has mixed up his formations and juggled the players. He would have wanted to go further but it wasn’t to be.

‘I spoke to him a couple of times and swapped a few emails but it’s been difficult because he’s been travelling.’

Van Gaal will have little time to get to know his new players before United leave on the club’s pre-season tour of America a week on Friday.

Man in charge: Ryan Giggs has been retained in his new position as assistant manager to Van Gaal

But
 Giggs believes that United will benefit from England’s early exit from 
the World Cup with Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck, Phil Jones, Chris 
Smalling and Luke Shaw now able to be on the trip from the start, along 
with the likes of David De Gea, Juan Mata, Antonio Valencia and Shinji 
Kagawa.

He added: ‘The 
new manager will be joining us next week, probably in the early or 
middle part of the week, when he can meet the players.

‘It’s worked out quite well that the lads who unfortunately went out of the World Cup early can now travel.

‘We’ll have nine or 10 big names from the World Cup which is great for the fans in the USA and for the club as well.’

In
 Van Gaal’s absence, Giggs has been overseeing training with the help of
 new coaches Albert Stuivenberg and Marcel Bout who started work at 
Carrington on Monday.

The
 former United winger confirmed that they have been working to Van 
Gaal’s instructions, with the players ordered to do a double training 
session – including a rare evening workout – on Tuesday.

He
 said: ‘Everything is planned through Louis, Albert and Marcel. They 
know how he works. The blueprint is prepared by Louis and we’re just 
following his plans.

‘It’s
 not ideal because you want all your players and manager there but it 
can be like this in a World Cup year. The difference is the manager 
involved in World Cup this time.

‘Preparations
 have gone well but we’ll all be together within a week and he can get 
to know the players. There’s plenty of time before the season starts.’

Giggs
 was asked about his meeting with Van Gaal in Holland in May when he was
 offered the job as No.2 and discussed the club with the new manager.

He
 said: ‘Basically it was just a couple of hours I spent with him going 
through the players at the club - ones going and maybe those coming in. 
It was just a chance to hear how he works and what he expects and for me
 to give an insight into Manchester United and anything I could help him
 with. It was not dwelling on last season.

‘We
 went through players who are here and he likes. I get to know the 
players we are looking at but some of them could still be part of the 
World Cup or on holiday. I’m not sure how many more will come in. We 
will have to wait and see. Everyone is excited by this new era.

'We are all pulling in the direction and we need to do that to get back to the top.’
