Malaysia's defence minister says his step-grandmother is the country's only national yet to be identified and recovered from the MH17 crash site.

Hishammuddin Hussein visited Perth on Wednesday to officially launch the Malaysian contracted MH370 search vessel and its underwater probe.

When asked what he thought about Prime Minister Tony Abbott's comment to 'shirt-front' Russian president Vladimir Putin, Mr Hussein said finger-pointing was only complicating an already complicated issue.

The prime minister grabbed global headlines after pledging to 'shirt front' Mr Putin during the G20 leader meeting.

But he later insisted he would hold robust talks with the Russian president over the 'murder' of 38 Australians who died when MH17 was shot down over east Ukraine.

Mr Hishammuddin said of the 43 Malaysians who died in the crash, 42 had been recovered.

'There's only one missing, and that's my step-grandmother,' Mr Hishammuddin said.

But the minister said he had put aside his personal feelings on that because he didn't want to risk the lives of security forces going into a war zone.

'To complicate that with finger-pointing - I would leave it to the criminal investigation committee,' he said.

'We will find justice for MH17.'

'How we find that justice must be detached from any other geo-political consideration.' 

Mr Hussein has vowed they 'will find justice for MH17'
