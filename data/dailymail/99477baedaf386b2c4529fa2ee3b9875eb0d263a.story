Writer's block? Playwright Sir Tom Stoppard, 76, says he is struggling to find enough thinking time to come up with new ideas

Playwright Sir Tom Stoppard has admitted he has forgotten how to write a play.

The Oscar-winning script-writer, who has penned more than 30 plays during his career, said his brain 'just isn't good enough anymore' and is struggling to focus.

The 76-year-old, who wrote the screenplay for the Academy Award-winning film Shakespeare in Love, said it now takes him over a week to concentrate on a new project.

Even though he has work planned for the next six months he is worried he does not have enough thinking time.

Stoppard has written extensively for BBC radio in a career spanning more than 50 years.

He has also been involved in writing Hollywood blockbusters such as Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.

His last major work, an adaption of Parade's End which was nominated for an Emmy last month, took four years to complete.

He told the Times2: 'When I was younger, I could do something useful just being free for half a day.

'But now I need five days to get the world I've left out of my head and ten days or a fortnight not talking to anyone to hold what I need to hold inside my head.

'I can't just put things aside for a day and come back.'

Stoppard's most recent work for the theatre was Rock'n'Roll for the Royal Court in 2006. He has not revealed the title of his next play but has hinted it will be based on the intersection between 'science and metaphysics.'

In 1939, Stoppard left Czechoslovakia as a child refugee, fleeing Nazi occupation, and settled with his family in Britain after the war.

Deciding against a university education, he became a playwright  in 1960 after stints as a journalist and a drama critic.

Stoppard did not receive an official credit for his work on Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, but director Steven Spielberg said, 'he was responsible for almost every 
line of dialogue in the film'.

He also worked in a similar capacity with Tim Burton on his film Sleepy Hollow.

Earlier this year, Stoppard wrote the play Darkside for BBC Radio 2, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd's album, The Dark Side of the Moon.

In 2008, Stoppard was voted number 76 on the Time 100, Time magazine's list of the most influential people in the world.
