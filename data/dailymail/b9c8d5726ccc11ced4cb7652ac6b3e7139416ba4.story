Vietnamese police are designing a new Spider Gun-type device to help launch fine fishing nets at errant motorists to snare illegal boy racers on the streets of the northern province of Thanh Hoa.

For years officers have launched fine fishing nets into the paths of runaway bikers, causing their wheels to clog up and their bikes to grind to a halt.

But today the police force are working on a new weapon - a 'fishnet launcher'.

Vietnamese police are designing a new Spider Gun-type device to help launch fine fishing nets at errant motorists to snare illegal boy racers on the streets of the northern province of Thanh Hoa

For years officers have launched the nets at the wheels of motorcycles to stop them in their tracks

The new design for a Spider Gun, resembles a standard gun. Vietnamese police say the new weapon should be ready for mass production soon

The nets get caught around the rear wheels, clogging the mechanism and causing the bikes to grind to a halt

The device, which resembles a gun, should be ready for mass production soon.

In October 2011 the Thanh Hoa police first used fishing nets, manually throwing them at the rear wheels of drivers flouting the law.

But the controversial measure was suspended in March last year, before being revived recently to stop illegal racers over Christmas.

Lieutenant Colonel My Duy Xuan, chief of the town traffic police, told Live Leak: 'The new launcher is expected to be more effective in stopping illegal racers driving at any speed.'

He said the force plan to continue using the nets, adding that they have also been improved.

'We fold the net and use specialized lead weights to make the flinging easier and more accurate as well as force the bike to decelerate slowly and not in a sudden manner like before,' he said.

Officers using the method managed to seize 10 motorbikes on Christmas Eve.

Police have denied claims the nets are fired over the heads if motorists, saying they are aimed at the back wheels of the motorcycles

Police stressed the measure is safe and effective. It is understood it will only be used to catch illegal street racers at night.

Thanh Hoa police chief Colonel Le Van Nghiem said despite reports, officers do not throw the nets over the heads of riders.

He said the force has faced a rise in street racing in the last few years, with youngsters performing tricks on the streets late at night, without helmets for protection.

He said many people were too frightened to go out at night after a series of crashes.

Between January and March last year, the police seized more than 200 motorbikes after employing the use of the nets.
