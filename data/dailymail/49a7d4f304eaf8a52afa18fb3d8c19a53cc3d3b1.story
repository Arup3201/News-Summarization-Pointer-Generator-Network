The Pakistani schoolgirl shot by a Taliban gunman because she championed education for girls and other Western values was today transferred to a specialist hospital.

Surgeons yesterday announced Malala Yousufzai, 14, was in a stable condition after removing a bullet from her neck.

But following Taliban threats to kill her, authorities in Pakistan decided to move her to a hospital in the army garrison town of Rawalpindi for her own safety.

Malala was shot, along with two other
girls, by a gunman who boarded her school bus in Swat on Tuesday. The 
would-be assassin blasted her in the neck and head but she survived.

One of the other victims has now recovered, while the other remains in a critical condition.

Authorities today announced they have identified her attacker and offered a 10,000,000 rupee (£119,000) reward for his capture.

Regional governor Masood Kausar said: 
'The security agencies are closely working with each other and they have
a lot of information about the perpetrators. We hope our security 
agencies will soon capture them and bring to justice.'

The shooting has drawn condemnation 
from world leaders and many Pakistanis. Yesterday there were protests 
against the Taliban across the country in support of Malala.

Her father, Ziauddin Yousufzai, who 
runs a girls' school, said his daughter had defied threats for years, 
believing the good work she was doing for her community was her best 
protection.

'Pray for her,' her distraught uncle Faiz Mohammad said as Malala was taken from the hospital in Peshawar to the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology in Rawalpindi.

A husband-and-wife team of two 
British doctors who were attending a seminar in Pakistan today joined 
local surgeons in treating Yousufzai.

And yesterday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the United States had offered any assistance necessary.

'The President found the news reprehensible and disgusting and tragic,' Carney told reporters.

'Directing violence at children is 
barbaric, it's cowardly, and our hearts go out to her and the others who
were wounded as well as their families.'

Yousufzai had spent the last three years campaigning for girls' education after the Taliban shut down girls' schools.

She received Pakistan's highest civilian award but also a number of death threats.

Fury over the attack has spread across 
the country, with demonstrators protesting in Lahore, Peshawar, 
Islamabad and Mingora yesterday.

Many schools in Swat Valley closed 
their doors in protest over the shooting, and the country's army chief 
vowed to fight on against militants as anger erupted across the nation.

The Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) 
have taken responsibility for the assassination attempt and told a 
Pakistani newspaper they will target her again if she survives.

A man approached the school bus and 
asked which one of the girls was Malala, Rasool Shah, Mingora police 
chief said.

Malala was pointed out by a girl near her, but after the young activist lied about her identity the gunman shot both of them.

A spokesman for the TTP told Pakistani
newspaper The Express Tribune that Malala was shot because she was a 
’secular-minded lady’ and that this should serve as a warning for other 
young people like her.

The country's top military officer, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, issued a strongly-worded statement condemning the attack.

The powerful army chief rarely makes such public pronouncements, even when it comes to military matters.

Referring
to the 2009 military operation that saved Swat Valley from Taliban 
control, he said: 'In attacking Malala, the terrorists 
have failed to grasp that she is not only an individual, but an icon of 
courage and hope who vindicates the great sacrifices that the people of 
Swat and the nation gave, for wresting the valley from the scourge of 
terrorism.'

As well as 
the closure of schools, flags in front of the Mingora government 
headquarters were at half-mast, and police officers stood guard outside 
Malala's family's house in case they were also targeted by Taliban 
assassins.

Attempt: A Pakistani Taliban organisation have taken responsibility for the shooting which also injured another girl on the bus leaving their school in Mingora

Speaking from an undisclosed location, Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan said that Malala would not be safe if she survives.

The failed assassination displayed 
the viciousness of Islamic militants in Swat Valley, an area which has struggled
with militant insurgent influence despite military operations.

At
one time the picturesque region - nicknamed the Switzerland of Pakistan
- was a popular tourist destination for Pakistanis. Honeymooners 
vacationed along the river.

Then the Taliban in 2007 began infiltrating the valley, eventually assuming near-total control of the region before being ejected in a massive Pakistani military operation in 2009.
