A New Hampshire girl got exactly what she was after Thursday after licking a flag pole during last week's wicked winter weather.

Maddie Gilmartin, 12, says the idea just came to her and she acted on it without thinking twice.

'Did I really just do that to myself,' the East Kingston girl recalls thinking as she waited 15 minutes for her parents to free her.

Oops: Maddie Gilmartin, 12, made the once-a-lifetime mistake of licking a flagpole in her front yard during llast week's blizzard

Gilmartin was with her father during the huge blizzard last week that dumped over a foot of snow in parts of the Northeast.

The high was 17 degrees Fahrenheit in Gilmartin's New England town that day.

While her dad was far down the driveway plowing snow, the idea came to her.

'It just kind of popped into my head, "Hey what would happen if I stuck my tongue to a flag pole?"' Maddie Gilmartin told WMUR. 'At the moment, I was like, it will come right off.'

But she was wrong. And unfortunately, the first thing she tried to do was pull.

It was a moment straight out of the classic holiday film A Christmas Story. Only Maddie had never seen the film.

'It just kind of popped into my head': Maddie says she just licked the pole believing her tongue couldn't possibly become stuck

'I see her standing at the flag pole, her arms are waving,' said her dad Shawn Gilmartin.  'I'm not sure what's going on until I got closer.' He and his wife helped get their daughter loose after 15 minutes. It will take 6 months for the swelling to go down completely

'I see her standing at the flag pole, her arms are waving,' said her dad Shawn Gilmartin.  'I'm not sure what's going on until I got closer.'

By the time he realized his daughter's sill mistake, she'd made things worse for herself.

'She tried to pull her tongue off of it as soon as it happened and that's what made it bleed,' said Shawn Gilmartin.  'I had my hands cupped, I was blowing, breathing on her lips and tongue.'

Shawn and his wife frantically grappled for a way to release their daughter and eventually settled on warm water as they waited for paramedics.

Maddie is expcted to recover, but doctors say it will take up to six months for the swelling in her mouth to go down.

Which means Maddie will have plenty of time to keep pondering the question that went through her head just after her tongue hit the pole: 'Like, did I really just do that?'
