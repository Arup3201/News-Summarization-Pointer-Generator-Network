'We pulled off on the side of the road,' said 3TV producer Jason Berry, who was driving on Interstate 10 from Tucson to Phoenix. 'There was a gas station probably about 50 feet in front of us and we couldn't see it, so we were out there for probably about 20-30 minutes just kind of waiting it out.' 

One Phoenix resident captured the remarkable event with a camera, strapped to a drone. The resulting footage gives a bird's eye view of his neighborhood, in the moments before the dust arrived.

The weather also caused about 1,200 customers in the San Tan Valley to lost electricity. 

The Phoenix area is expected to receive two inches of rain by Tuesday morning.
