Army chiefs have made an extraordinary appeal to dozens of former paratroopers at the centre of the Bloody Sunday controversy to volunteer their names and addresses to a new investigation by police in Northern Ireland.

The move has sparked a bitter backlash from some Parachute Regiment veterans who fear that the identities will become known of those involved on the streets of Londonderry in 1972 when 14 people died.

The identities of the soldiers – some now in their 60s and 70s – have been protected by successive inquiries over four decades.

Forty-year controversy: Soldiers arrest a man on Bloody Sunday. Army chiefs have appealed to paratroopers involved to volunteer their names and addresses to a new investigation

Police say the new and complex inquiry is expected to last four years and could lead to criminal prosecutions of veteran paratroopers.

Last night one former paratrooper, who was on duty on Bloody Sunday, said: ‘This has caused considerable anger and the implications are huge.

‘Even 40 years on some of us are authorised to carry personal protection weapons because of the obvious threat to our lives and those of our families.

‘We see this as a clear warning that the identities of those soldiers doing their duty that day in appalling circumstances and under attack on the streets of Britain are in real danger of leaking out with obvious consequences.

‘The Ministry of Defence is clearly not in a position to guarantee our anonymity so many will be reluctant to co-operate, making the police inquiry something of a farce.’

A letter from Caron Tassel, of the directorate of judicial engagement policy at the MoD, is being sent to regimental associations asking for those involved during Bloody Sunday to contact the ministry.

It has been sanctioned by the Parachute Regiment’s Colonel Commandant, Lieutenant General Jacko Page. The letter contains the warning: ‘We feel it is only fair to let witnesses know that we may be required to disclose those details to the police at some stage.’

And to the concern of veteran Paras, there is no reassurance that identities will be protected. The letter only says: ‘We are aware that a number of witnesses to the Saville Inquiry were granted anonymity and may be concerned whether the police investigation will affect that.

Fourteen people died after paratroopers opened fire on demonstrators in January 1972

‘We understand those concerns and will be raising this with the Police Service of Northern Ireland so they can take this into account when planning their inquiry.’

Last month police commanders briefed relatives of the 14 who died after paratroopers opened fire on demonstrators in January 1972 that a new investigation would be launched. It came after they and prosecutors reviewed the findings of the Saville public inquiry.

Following a 12-year inquiry costing £195million, Lord Saville found that the killings were unjustified and that none of the dead posed a threat when they were shot. That contradicted the long-standing official version of events, outlined in the 1972 Widgery report, which had exonerated the soldiers. The Saville inquiry prompted David Cameron to apologise to the relatives.

Crucially, statements given by witnesses, who were only identified by a letter, to the Saville inquiry cannot be used as evidence in criminal proceedings.

The letter stresses: ‘The purpose of this letter is to reassure you of the MoD’s policy to support its people, whether serving or veterans, in circumstances when their actions, conducted in good faith whilst on operations, come under judicial scrutiny.’

But another former paratrooper, who served in the regiment in 1972, added: ‘We now have known terrorists in our Parliament and we don’t know who to trust. The authorities will not be getting my address and that is for sure.’

Last night the MoD said: ‘We may be obliged to provide the PSNI with details of former soldiers. We will take great care to identify the names that are subject to an anonymity order clearly so that they continue to be protected.’
