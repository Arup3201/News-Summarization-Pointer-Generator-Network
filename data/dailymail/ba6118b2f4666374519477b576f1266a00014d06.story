There was great deal of political unrest among nightclubbers on the eve of Queensland's state elections after they were sent an anti-Labor text message by popular party venues. 

The SMS from nightclubs Family and Cloudland, owned by the Katarzyna Group, reminded patrons of the opposition party's policy to 'shut pubs and clubs early'.

And club-goers wasted no time in expressing their outrage as their protest was heard loud and clear by flooding the club Facebook pages with complaints.

This comes as Queenslanders hit polling booths across the Sunshine State on Saturday with the Liberal National Party set to cop a battering, but hold onto power.

The short text message, sent on Friday afternoon, urged patrons to be mindful of some of Labor's plans for nightclubs in Queensland.

'Be careful with your vote on Saturday,' it read.

'Labor wants to shut pubs and clubs early.'

Cloudland's Facebook page was soon filled with backlash from club members, some saying the 'text message was a big mistake'.

Another angered patron wrote: 'Don't send me text messages telling me how a certain party's policies may affect your revenue. I know how to vote.'

Further comments also indicated patrons of Family also received the same text message. 

Daily Mail Australia have reached out to the Katarzyna Group for comment.

Cloudland particularly received a lot of backlash on their Facebook page just before the state election

One club member was 'disgusted with Cloudland' for their political text message

Another club-goer wrote that it was 'inappropriate to use my details to push' the nightclub's political agenda

Further comments on social media also indicated patrons of Family also received the same text message

The final opinion polls suggest there will be a swing to Labor of 8-12 per cent on Saturday, meaning the opposition could pick up between 15-30 seats.

This comes as the latest Newspoll shows the LNP is set to retain government in Queensland but with a much-reduced majority. 

About 2.5 million Queenslanders are expected to lodge their vote in Saturday's state election.

The Electoral Commission of Queensland says 328,601 people have already voted in pre-polling.

Voting is compulsory and polling booths close at 6pm.
