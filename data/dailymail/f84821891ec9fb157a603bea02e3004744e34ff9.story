Charge: A think-tank suggests the NHS could use money earned from GP visits towards opening hours

Patients should be charged £10 a night to stay in hospital and £10 every time they see their GP, according to a think-tank.

It also wants to raise prescription fees, make dying patients pay for end-of-life care and impose £10 fines for every missed appointment.

Reform, an independent think-tank, says the charges could be used to improve certain NHS services such as funding surgeries to open at weekends.

It also claims the fees are ‘unavoidable’ as the NHS is incurring billions of debts footing the bill for the care of the aging population.

But campaigners fear such charges will unfairly penalise the elderly and those with long-term conditions and may deter them from seeking help.

Estimates show the health service will have annual debts of £30billion by 2020 and there are growing concerns that standards are far worse compared to other countries in Europe.

Around two-thirds of Western countries charge patients to see their GP ranging from 80p in France to £18 in Sweden, with an extra £5 for a home visit.

And half make patients pay for hospitals visits or stays including Sweden where they are £7.50 per night and Portugal which makes them pay £8 every time they go to A&E.

Thomas Cawston, research director at the think-tank said: ‘The Government must find a way of generating more money for the NHS.

‘We currently have a system which is very generous.

‘A lot of people who are reasonably well off wouldn’t mind paying £10 for a GP appointment on a Saturday morning, for example.’

‘Few will want to debate higher NHS charges but the funding outlook for the service makes it unavoidable. Prescription charges are the easiest route to new revenue, with exemptions for people on low incomes built in.’

The think-tank also recommends charging patients £10 for every night they spend in hospital and would consider making them pay for unnecessary A&E visits.

Poll: More than half of GPs are in favour of the change, with some suggesting charges of up to £25

It would also raise prescription costs from £7.85 to £10 and make the elderly and pregnant women pay - currently they are exempt from charges.

Controversially, it wants to impose a means-tested system for end of life care meaning the majority of dying patients would pay for pain relief and extra nursing.

This summer a poll found that half of GPs are in favour of charging patients for appointments - with some wanting to impose fees of between £5 and £25 a time.

A poll of 440 GPs by Pulse magazine found that 51 per cent were in favour of making patients pay to deter them for turning up unnecessarily.

One, Dr Shailendra Bhatt, a GP in Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire, said: ‘I work in a walk-in centre.

‘The amount of people who come through the door for practically no reason at all and say “I was out and saw this sign for a walk-in centre where one can see a doctor, so I came in.”

‘People don’t value the things if they get it cheap, worse still if they get it for nothing.’
