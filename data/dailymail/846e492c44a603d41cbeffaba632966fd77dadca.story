Manchester United star Ryan Giggs has given a tour of his new Hotel Football - and admits he couldn't resist being the first to have a kick-about on the rooftop pitch. 

The Reds' assistant manager was one of the first to stay overnight at the venue on Tuesday, as staff prepare for its public opening day on March 2. 

Giggs and ex-teammate and now Sky Sports pundit and England coach Gary Neville launched a joint hospitality company – GG Hospitality – with ambitions of developing a worldwide football-themed hotel and restaurant empire.

The hotel officially opens on March 2, but is holding 'soft launches' at the restaurant for the next couple of weeks

And Giggs took advantage of all of the hotel facilities, including the rooftop where he famously had a kickabout with his fellow former United legends Paul Scholes, Gary and Phil Neville and Nicky Butt, when the area was still a building site.

He said: 'I think Cafe Football is my favourite part of the hotel, but what is great is there are so many different elements to the offering here.

'It's great to have the five-a-side pitch on the rooftop with fantastic views of Manchester United, Salford Quays and the city in the background. 

'Me and the kids had a kick-about up there last night. But what is great is you could go up there and get married, or have a kids' party, or it could be a Ministry of Sound club night.'

Giggs said he and the GG Hospitality team have been delighted with how the hotel has now come together after years in the planning.

Ryan Giggs tested out the food offerings in the restaurant and was impressed with his pizza and fish and chips

He said: 'It's been four or five years in the making so it's nice to experience it and see it finally coming to fruition. 

'Obviously here it's right in the shadow of Old Trafford, but Hotel Football is something we hope to take around the UK and eventually around the world, so it's more a celebration of football in general.'

Meanwhile Giggs couldn't resist tasting a whole host of Cafe Football's menu. 

The restaurant and cafe areas have a relaxed feel and the sport of football is certainly not thrust in your face 

As well as being a tribute to the beautiful game, there are other sports or activities to amuse guests

He added: 'You can tell I've retired now. I had a little pizza to start, then fish and chips and finished it off with Vimto trifle.

'A lot of the menu is stuff from your childhood, like bubble gum ice cream.'.

Talking about the new development, Gary Neville said: 'Ryan and I have spent so much of our lives playing at Old Trafford and appreciate everyone who supported us there over the years.

'To make sure that the hotel appeals to everyone, not just football fans, we are working with some of the most talented people in the industry to create something unique and inviting – with a focus on excellent customer service.'

The hotel officially opens on March 2, but is holding 'soft launches' at the restaurant for the next couple of weeks, with 50 per cent off in the restaurant, and rooms available from £50 a night.

The 10-storey building will also house a supporters club, and Neville has previously said it will play host to up to 1,250 fans before matches.

Giggs and Neville were on site and pictured talking to the builders who are working on the project.

The hotel will also hold conferencing and other events, such as the sporting memorabilia show currently on, with signed photos of ex-players

According to 'Caterer and Hotelkeeper', Hotel Football is costing £20million as the players link up with two Singaporean businessmen - Kiam Ho and Andy Yun - as the major shareholders.

Friends of the footballers as well as some fellow players are also reported to be involved in the project.

It is unknown how much money that Neville and Giggs are committing themselves to the company GG Hospitality.

It will be the parent company of Cafe Football, with the first restaurant outlet open in the Westfield Centre in Stratford.

It is expected to seat around 120 people and will be offering affordable food, with two courses available for £16-per-head.
