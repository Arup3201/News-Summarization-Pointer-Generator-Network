Speculation over a secret meeting of potential Liberal leadership hopefuls has led Malcolm Turnbull to live-tweet his train trip to the NSW Central Coast.

2GB talkback radio host Ben Fordham caused a stir on Thursday morning when he tweeted: 'Interesting fact: Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop have arranged to meet at his Sydney home today'. 

After one of Mr Turnbull's spokesmen denied the report to media including Daily Mail Australia, Fordham insisted the Communications Minister himself would not deny the allegation.

So Mr Turnbull tweeted a picture of himself seated on a Sydney train, grinning. The message to Fordham: 'You need to improve (your) surveillance!

Cheeky grin: Malcolm Turnbull tweeted this picture as evidence of his current location

Contenders? Mr Turnbull and Ms Bishop have been at the centre of leadership speculation in recent days, with Ms Bishop issuing a statement earlier this week saying she would not challenge the Prime Minister

'I am on the train to Tuggerah. (Politics in the Pub) North Wyong tonight',' Mr Turnbull said. 

The Communications Minister followed up by insisting he was at a National Broadband Network meeting in North Sydney this morning, where he boarded the train. 

He then posted a series of images of his train crossing the Hawkesbury River, featuring mangroves and settlements along the riverside. 

The trip concluded with Mr Turnbull arriving at Tuggerah train station (and sharing a picture of the moment) before he emphatically insisted he has not and would not meet Ms Bishop today unless she came to the Dam Hotel, North Wyong, this evening. 

The spat provoked Ms Bishop to join the fray, insisting she was in Canberra this morning and a shopping centre in Penrith, greater western Sydney, with a local MP after that. 

'I did not meet Malcolm Turnbull at his home - I even told you (the) Qantas flight I was on! So what's the point you're (not) making?' she wrote, even adding in her trademark emoji in a later post. 

Regardless, Mr Turnbull and Ms Bishop are set to cross paths this weekend, according to reports. 

Earlier this week, News Corp reported the power-duo will be guests of honour at the Liberal Party Bellevue Hill Branch's brunch on Sunday. 

Ms Bishop was pictured accompanying Liberal MP Fiona Scott to Westfield Penrith. The deputy Liberal leader is often in demand for electorate visits
