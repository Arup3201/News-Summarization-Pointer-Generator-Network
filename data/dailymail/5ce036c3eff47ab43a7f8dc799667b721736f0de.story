Unbeknown to her, Mr Anderson, an engineer, had gone off to do some last-minute ring shopping.

He roped in the nurses at North Hills Hospital in Forth Worth to make the moment as romantic as possible for his wife-to-be - who works for American Airlines.

Ashleigh Campbell, a nurse, told KTVT: 'The dad came out and told us that he wanted to get married. At first, we didn't think he meant now.'

Mr Anderson said that he had proposed because he did not like the idea of his partner, whom be became engaged to in August last year, having their daughter without a ring on her finger.

Baby girl Janelle arrived half an hour after her parents tied the knot

While Mr Anderson rushed to find a 
wedding ring, Ms Campbell called in her father, who is a preacher to 
perform the impromptu service.

The nurses decorated the very expectant mother's birthing room, draping white sheets over the window.

As Brandi's water broke, the brief ceremony began with her saying her vows through moans from her labor pains.

The
 couple's six-year-old son acted as a ring bearer as the couple were 
married in just a few minutes.

Half an hour into their 'honeymoon',
 they received the perfect wedding gift - a baby girl who the couple named 
Janelle.
