Two British girls locked up in Peruvian jail have not eaten for seven days and are said to be terrified and hysterical after they were arrested on suspicion of trying to smuggle £1.5million of cocaine out of the country.

Michaella McCollum Connolly, 20, and Melissa
Reid, 19, are being held in maximum security cells following claims the pair may have been working for a South American cartel.

Twelve guards armed with automatic assault rifles and handguns patrol the perimeter of the building.

Michaella McCollum Connolly was arrested last Tuesday along with Melissa Reid on suspicion of smuggling £1.5million of cocaine. Both are being held in a prison in Peru which they have described as hell

One guard told The Daily Mirror: 
'Ever since they arrived both have refused to eat or drink. They have 
starved themselves while saying they are innocent. If they are found 
guilty they will see what hell is really like.

'One has gone to pieces. She is 
hysterical. She keeps crying saying there has been a huge mistake. They 
are both starting to realise just how serious this is.'

As far as their parents knew, Miss
Reid and Miss McCollum Connolly were spending the summer working 
in bars and clubs around the Mediterranean. But now they are facing up to 25 years in jail if convicted.

The girls' families are today preparing to fly to the country.

Hell: The notorious Santa Monica women's prison in Lima where the girls could end up if convicted

Former counsel general in Lima, Michael Russell, said Peruvian jails are 'pretty dour and horrible'.

'It's all a matter of money, quite 
frankly. You have to buy your space, you have to buy your food. If you 
don't have money you suffer quite a lot.'

Miss
Reid and Miss McCollum Connolly were arrested last Tuesday after 
officers say they found more than 11kg of the Class A drug in their suitcases as 
they checked in for a 6,000-mile flight back to Spain.

The Foreign Office is said to be providing assistance to the girls but according to the guard they have had no visitors.

Shock: The parents of Melissa Reid have yet to come to terms with their daughter's arrest saying they had no idea she had even left the island of Ibiza

Unsure future: Melissa and Michaella are currently held in prison in Lima, Peru

Shocked: Melissa Reid's parents William and Debra said they are struggling to come to terms with the news. They thought their daughter was still in Ibiza

Miss Reid left her job as a sales assistant at Next and travelled to Ibiza in June.

Her mother Debra, 53, said she had been stunned to discover her daughter was no longer there.

She
said: ‘As far as we knew, Melissa was in Ibiza. That is where she has 
been. She met the other girl out in Ibiza. I don’t know anything else 
about her.’

Speaking 
from the family’s £400,000 detached home in Lenzie, near Glasgow, her 
53-year-old father William added: ‘We are just trying to come to terms 
with it and we don’t really know anything.’

The family were unsure what to do. 
‘If it was in Spain, it would be easier to jump on a plane out there to 
be close to her, but Peru is a lot further away,’ he said.

The
family of photography student Miss McCollum Connolly, who was studying at Belfast Metropolitan College, launched a 
missing-person appeal after she failed to answer her phone or update her
Facebook page for almost a fortnight.

They
say they did not know the aspiring model from Belfast had left the 
popular Ibizan party town of San Antonio, where she had been working 
occasionally as a nightclub hostess since June.

But Spanish police say Miss McCollum Connolly had not been formally reported missing.

Her mother Nora said: ‘We have been 
speaking to Michaella. It’s a very difficult time. We hadn’t heard from 
her in 12 days, and now this.’

While her sister Samantha told the Irish Independent: 'We're trying not to think of the media right now because some stuff is quite upsetting and there's been some pictures in the paper which are very distressing.'

The pair had posted dozens of photographs on their Facebook pages showing them enjoying the nightlife in Ibiza.

It is feared they may have been 
targeted by one of the drug gangs operating in Ibiza that offer thousands 
of pounds to ‘mules’ who carry cocaine from South America to Europe in 
their suitcases.

A total of 248 suspected mules were 
arrested at Lima’s airport last year and nearly 1,600kg of drugs, mainly
cocaine, confiscated.

Serious: If the girls are convicted, they could be moved to Santa Monica jail - a women's prison with filthy conditions where HIV and tuberculosis are rife

The majority of those arrested are 
Spanish, with most mules heading for Spain, but there is a growing trend
for vulnerable Britons to be targeted as mules.

It is understood the British women 
took an internal flight in Peru to Cuzco, where they were allegedly 
given the cocaine before flying back to Lima.

Police said the pair, who flew to the
country on August 1, were found with 11kg of cocaine hidden in food 
packets in their luggage at Jorge Chávez International Airport.

They had been trying to check in for an Air Europa flight to Madrid on Tuesday, with Palma, Majorca, as their final destination.

A spokesman said: ‘Police searched 
the women’s luggage. They found 18 packets of food products with 
cocaine, which weighed 5.78 kilos, in Melissa Reid’s suitcase.

‘Sixteen packets with cocaine weighing 5.810 kilos were found in Michaella McCollum’s suitcases.’

The pair are being held in a local 
women’s prison, but if convicted they are likely to be sent to a 
notorious women’s jail called Santa Monica in Chorrillos.

The prison was built for just 250 
women but now houses more than 1,000 in filthy conditions  in which HIV 
and tuberculosis  are rife.

Cuzco, a World Heritage Site where 
tourists can begin visits to Machu Picchu, is a favourite cocaine 
pick-up point for drug mules, known locally as burriers.

Anti-drugs police chief Anderson 
Reyes Ugarte said: ‘Before, gangs would target poor people, but recently
the burriers we’re arresting come from Europe, mainly from Spain.

‘I suppose this situation is the result of the economic crisis and unemployment.’
