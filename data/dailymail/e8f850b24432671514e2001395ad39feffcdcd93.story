The fall from grace for former NSW Labor Party heavyweights Eddie Obeid and Ian Macdonald is complete, with both set to face prosecution next month.

The Independent Commission Against Corruption revealed on Thursday that the former NSW Ministers will be prosecuted for the offence of misconduct in public office.

A defiant Mr Obeid, however, declared his innocence in 'every instance' as the corrupt former ALP power-broker faces prosecution.

Eddie Obeid fronted the media on Thursday saying 'those inquiries were nothing but sham inquiries that wanted to make ICAC look good'

Obeid will face court for corruptly lobbying public servants to extend leases for family-owned businesses in Sydney's Circular Quay.

The former minister has been the subject of eight corruption probes and found corrupt by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on a number of occasions.

He still maintains he has done nothing wrong.

'Innocent in every instance,' he told reporters outside his mansion in Sydney's Hunters Hill.

'Those inquiries were nothing but sham inquiries that wanted to make ICAC look good.'

He said the ICAC had 'a lot to answer'.

'We have our complaints and we'll see how they handle that,' he said.
