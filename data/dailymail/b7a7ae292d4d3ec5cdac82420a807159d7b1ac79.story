Should Andy Murray’s defence of his Wimbledon title this coming fortnight be disappointingly brief then blame should not be laid at the door of his new coach Amelie Mauresmo.

The reigning champion discovered on Friday that Belgium’s David Goffin, a neat striker of the ball who looks like he might be  the shy one in a boyband, will be his opponent when he steps out on to Centre Court at 1pm on Monday.

And in the unlikely event of the worst happening, he warned against using his mentor  Mauresmo as a scapegoat. ‘I could lose in the first round and it  certainly wouldn’t be her fault,’ said Murray.

‘You cannot, as a coach, change anything in five or six days. It is silly to suggest otherwise. But what I can sense is whether I feel like things we are working on in practice are the right things, whether I feel like we communicate well, tactics and the way we talk after a match.

‘I have enjoyed the last few days. I don’t think the first few (at Queen’s where he lost in the third round) were the perfect place to start.

‘Every time we were on the practice court and she stood  anywhere near me there were the clicks of a hundred cameras. It is normal to be a bit uptight in those circumstances, especially as we did not know each other well at that stage.

‘Since Queen’s we have managed to get away from everything and spend some time together on court. I had dinner with her on Wednesday night. I suppose the thing that has surprised me is that she has fitted in with the team very quickly.’

Unlike what initially seemed  to be the case 12 months ago, Murray’s early draw looks relatively kind, although 23-year-old Goffin is someone whose natural talent exceeds that of his ranking of 104.

He reached Wimbledon’s third round two years ago and defeated Bernard Tomic, who had made the last eight at SW19 12 months before.

Goffin will not blast Murray off the court but is a skilled opponent who is attractive to watch — it is to be hoped he does not become this year’s Steve Darcis, the little-known Belgian who took out Rafael Nadal in the 2013 first round.

Murray should face a relatively easy first week, although big-serving Kevin Anderson would present problems. But to beat David Ferrer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal in five days will be a considerable ask...Rnd    Possible opponent    Rank1st      D Goffin (Bel)             104 2nd     P Andujar (Sp)            79 3rd      R Bautista-Agut (Sp)   28 4th      K Anderson (SA)         18 Q/F     D Ferrer (Sp)               7 S/F     N Djokovic (Ser)            2 F         R Nadal (Sp)                1

Murray is scheduled to meet last year’s runner-up Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals this time. The Serb was practising at Wimbledon yesterday after pulling out of his favoured pre-Wimbledon exhibition on Thursday as a precaution to protect his wrist, which he notably flexed and shook at times yesterday.

Both Nadal and Roger Federer have potentially awkward second rounds. The Spaniard could meet Lukas Rosol, the man who knocked him out at the same stage in 2012, while Federer might meet Frenchman Julien Benneteau, who led him by two sets that same year.

Enough British players have have had the luck of sympathetic draws to encourage thoughts of several home first-round wins, while in the women’s draw the outstanding prospect is a quarter-final between the two favourites, Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova.
