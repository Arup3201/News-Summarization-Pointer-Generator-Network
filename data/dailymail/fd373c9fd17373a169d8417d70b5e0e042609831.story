In court: Eddy Shah arriving at the Old Bailey today where he admitted he lied to police about his sex sessions with a prostitute

Newspaper tycoon Eddy Shah has admitted he lied to police about his sex sessions with a prostitute because he was scared his former Bond girl wife would leave him.

Shah, 69, would meet call girl Susan Davies in top London hotels from the mid-1980s when he was away from his Manchester home.

The businessman was first introduced to her at a book launch at Harrods but when police raided his Cheshire mansion he said he started seeing her after the launch.

According to Shah, his mind went into 'meltdown' and he 'just blurted it out' because he was terrified his disabled wife Jennifer, who featured in the film Casino Royale film, would leave him with their three children.

‘I did lie,’ he told the jury today at the Old Bailey in central London.

‘I lied to the police principally because I was trying to protect my relationship at home.

‘I knew it had been a longer relationship with Susan I don’t know how much longer. Stupidly I tried to lie.

‘Having started that to protect myself at home I kept it going.’

The court has heard Shah slipped thousands of pounds into Davies’s handbag after steamy sessions in his grand suites at hotels like the Grosvenor House and the Intercontinental.

Prosecutors claim she also introduced him to a 14 year-old girl and they had sex up to eight times, sometimes as a threesome.

But Shah insists he never had sex with the teenager. 

He eventually made a statement to police admitting he had lied about the number of times he had sex with co-defendant Davies.

‘It was only after that I realised it was going to go to court and I was not prepared to lie in court that I came back and said this was the length of time I was seeing Susan Davies,’ he told the jury. 

In the first police interview, Shah also suggests he was being blackmailed by Davies.

Shah once owned a portfolio of local papers and started the now defunct Today.

He also owned and ran the Wiltshire Golf and Country Club, in Royal Wootton Bassett, until February this year after putting it on the market for £3.5m.

Shah admits that Davies was one of up to four prostitutes he was seeing when his life got ‘a bit wild’ in the early 1990s. 

But both he and Davies insist the teenager, who is now 34, was never involved in any sexual encounter with them.

Mother-of-four Davies is also accused of introducing the girl to her boyfriend Tony Pallant, 53, for threesomes.

The prosecution claim she was so obsessed with Pallant she arranged for him to have sex with the girl when she was just 13 after buying her a suspender set for her 12th birthday.

Shah, Davies and Pallant are charged with 13 separate sex attacks on the girl between 1991 and 1995.

Shah, of Kington Langley, near Chippenham, Wiltshire, denies six counts of rape between February 1993 and February 1995.

Pallant, 53, of West Malling, Kent, denies two counts of rape between 1992 and 1995 and four charges of indecent assault.

Davies, of Swanley, Kent, denies two charges of aiding and abetting the two alleged rapes by Pallant and the six alleged rapes by Shah, aiding and abetting the four indecent assaults, and a single charge of child cruelty.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
