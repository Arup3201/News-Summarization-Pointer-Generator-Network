A man who was critically injured after taking a single punch during a San Francisco charity race last month has been taken off of life support.

Stephen Martin, 31, was running in the Bay to Breakers race with a group of friends – in lighthearted fun, they had all dressed up as Troll dolls with outlandish wigs. But Martin and another man entered a confrontation, and with a single punch, Martin was in a coma.

Now police are again pleading with those who may have seen or recorded the confrontation, asking for photos and videos taken at the event.

Desperate hunt: San Francisco police are asking for any photos and video from the Bay to Breakers race where Stephen Martin was ultimately killed

Mystery man: Martin, far right, and his friends dressed as Troll dolls; police are seeking the identity of the man in the white 49ers jersey, far left, as a possible suspect

Suspect: Martin was standing with his friends in the Sharon Meadows area of Golden Gate Park hours after the race

The race, which is run by thousands of Bay Area residents annually during the third week of May, is supposed to be a day of fun, where runners traverse 12km across the city and end in Golden Gate Park.

Tragic: Martin's family said they allowed 'nature to take its course' after taking him off life support

It is a long-standing tradition to wear outlandish costumes.

But the blithe afternoon took a tragic turn as Martin, who was standing with his friends in the Sharon Meadows area of Golden Gate Park hours after the race, had a confrontation with another person, apparently over a cell phone.

According to San Francisco Police Cmdr. John Loftus, a confrontation ensued with a group of 12 men and women - some wearing white and red San Francisco 49ers jerseys.

Martin was dressed as a troll in a green wig.

San Jose Mercury News reports that the punch knocked Martin down onto the pavement, where he hit the back of his head. He never regained consciousness.

Police were not sure if the group wearing 49ers jerseys had participated in the race. 

Martin was in a coma for the three weeks following the incident.

His family released a statement after his death saying: 'As per the doctor's recommendation, we took him off life support Friday morning - and allowed nature to take its course.

'Thank you all for your prayers and support.’

On Monday, Police Chief Greg Suhr and top police brass pleaded publicly to those who might have taken photos or videos near the area of the May 20 attack to contact them.

'We can't get enough,' Mr Suhr said. 'Err on the side of caution. If you think you have a photo or video that may be at all helpful, please send it along. ... Let us make the decision on whether it is useful or not.'

Scene of the crime: The attack happened near this path in Golden Gate Park

Expansive: Golden Gate Park consists of 1017 acres of public grounds and is the third most visited park in the U.S.

Mr Loftus showed photos of Martin and his friends posing with some of the alleged suspects before the altercation, including one man with a Niners jersey and a SF tattoo on the right side of his neck and a woman wearing an orange tutu.

Mr Loftus said the suspects may be involved in a gang.

'We're trying to get photos of the actual assault,' he said in a press conference. 'We want to identify all of the people in this photograph. They are all people of interest.'

He added, 'This is a tragic crime. This gentleman finished running the Bay to Breakers race several hours before and was socializing with this group, and now he's dead.'

The 12-kilometer annual race from the city's Financial District to Golden Gate Park is infamous for its wild costumes, nudity and daylong revelry.

In recent years, police have cracked down on runners drinking during the spectacle.

This year's race drew more than 40,000 participants, some of whom were dressed as penguins, superheroes and fruit.

About 19 people were arrested that day.
