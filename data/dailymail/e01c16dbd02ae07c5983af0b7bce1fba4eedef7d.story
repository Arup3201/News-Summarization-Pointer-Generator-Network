A breath test could spot the early signs of Type 1 diabetes in children long before they start to show symptoms, scientists have discovered.

Oxford University researchers are developing a hand-held device which could quickly identify the autoimmune disease, potentially saving many lives.

Unlike Type 2 diabetes, Type 1 diabetes is not caused by lifestyle or diet. The condition, which is thought to be genetic, means the body cannot produce its own insulin, stopping proper regulation of blood sugar.

It affects 400,000 people in Britain, usually first striking in childhood or adolescence. In one in four cases it is only picked up when the patient becomes gravely ill as their blood sugar levels soar.

Scientists hope their new discovery will help spot the condition much earlier, and reduce the rate of children falling into a harmful state called diabetic ketoacidosis – which can lead to coma or death.

The researchers have discovered a chemical produced by children with diabetes which makes their breath smell faintly of pear drops.

Although difficult to pick up by scent alone, they have developed a test which can spot the chemical on the breath of a child, giving an accurate and early indication of future problems.

It could allow a GP to identify the problem before a child is rushed into hospital – the traumatic way in which many people find out they have the disease.

The breakthrough, published today in the Journal of Breath Research, came about after tests on 113 children and teenagers aged seven to 18 at Oxford Children’s Hospital.

They found that children with low levels of insulin produced a chemical called ketone in their breath, giving it a faint smell of pear drops.

The chemical is an early sign of diabetic ketoacidosis, the condition associated with half the deaths of young people with diabetes.

It occurs when a lack of insulin means the body cannot use sugar for energy and starts to break down fat instead.

Ketones are the by-product of the breakdown of fat and, if left unchecked, can build up and cause the body to become acidic.

One specific form of ketone in the breath, called acetone, was found to be an accurate signal of the extent of the child’s diabetes.

The scientists, who hope to use their discovery to produce a handheld breathalyser, would be used in regular check-ups if a child shows early symptoms – which include tiredness, thirst and a lack of energy.

A blood test is currently used to the same effect, but they believe doctors would be more likely to use a breath test on a hunch, and children more likely to accept one.

Professor Gus Hancock, who co-wrote the study, said: ‘While breath acetone has been measured in relatively large cohorts of healthy individuals, most measurements on people with Type 1 diabetes have been carried out on relatively small cohorts, typically made up of less than 20 people, with relatively few measurements on children.

‘Our results have shown that it is realistically possible to use measurements of breath acetone to estimate blood ketones. 

‘We are working on the development of a small hand held device that would allow the possibility of breath measurements for ketone levels and help to identify children with new diabetes before diabetic ketoacidosis supervenes.

‘Currently testing for diabetes requires a blood test which can be traumatic for children.’

He said the test could also be used in already-diagnosed children, to establish when their condition was deteriorating.

‘If the relationship between breath acetone and blood ketone levels is true at higher levels of ketones, a simple breath-test could assist with the management of sick days in children with diabetes, preventing hospital admissions by providing a warning of the possible development of diabetic ketoacidosis.’

The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which raises funds for scientific investigation into Type one diabetes, last night welcomed the breakthrough.

Karen Addington, UK chief executive of JDRF, said: ‘Early diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes is crucial if people are to avoid being hospitalised with diabetic ketoacidosis. This is life-threatening and extremely traumatic for the individual’s wider family.

‘Any new knowledge from research that could help doctors to diagnose people more swiftly is to be very warmly welcomed. I hear far too many stories from people who were turned away by their doctors after their first visit.’

She added: ‘The best known symptoms of Type one diabetes are the “four ts” - more visits to the toilet, increased thirst, increased tiredness, and getting thinner. 

'But sweet-smelling breath, also known as pear drop breath, is another important clue. Some or all of these symptoms can be present.’
