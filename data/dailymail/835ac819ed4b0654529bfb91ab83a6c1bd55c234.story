A mother watched in horror as her seven month old baby boy choked on a plastic tube hidden in a jar of Boots baby food.

Oliver Field is lucky to be alive after accidentally eating the object found in the bottle of organic own-brand food bought in Portsmouth, Hampshire.

His mother, Samantha, said she watched in horror as the baby turned blue and began to lose consciousness.

Choking: Oliver Field, aged seven months, accidentally ate a plastic tube found in a jar of baby food. His mother Samantha, pictured, was able to dislodge it and raise the alarm

Luckily the 25-year-old was able to dislodge the tube before paramedics arrived.

Oliver
was taken Queen Alexandra Hospital, in Portsmouth, where doctors 
discovered he had a scratched throat. He is now recovering.

Samantha, from Portsmouth, said: 'I started feeding him then all of a sudden he started choking.

'It was really frightening. He started going blue and floppy and I was scared.

'I managed to get the tube out and then called 999. Paramedics checked him over and we went to Queen Alexandra Hospital in the ambulance.

'Doctors checked him over and said he’ll be fine, but he had a scratched throat.

Food: The tiny plastic tube (pictured right next to a Biro cap) was found in this bottle of Boots organic noodles in cheese and leek sauce, left

'I was disgusted the tube was in there and now I’m worried it could be in other jars of food.'

Boots today said early investigations had shown the incident was isolated and they have taken the decision not to recall jars of noodles in cheese and leek sauce.

They have offered Samantha £75 in vouchers and to pay for a trip to their local theatre.

A spokesman for Boots said: 'We’d like to take this opportunity to apologise to our customer for what must have been a very frightening experience.

'We take this type of issue very seriously, and the first thing we do is immediately check that there have been no other reported incidents with the product.

'We also alert our supplier so they can also check the batch and the supply chain for any problems.

'In this case our investigations are showing this was an isolated incident and so we haven’t recalled the line.

'We will continue to carefully investigate the issue.'
