Investigation: Sir Cliff Richard with his 'Man Friday' Father John McElynn who is said to be supporting him through the crisis

The BBC was plunged into a new crisis last night after it was publicly blasted by police over its role in the shock Sir Cliff Richard sex abuse investigation.

In an extraordinary attack on the broadcaster’s standards, furious South Yorkshire Police accused the Corporation of breaking its own guidelines.

The force took the highly unusual step of announcing it had written an official letter of complaint to Director-General Lord Tony Hall over the Corporation’s controversial coverage of the case.

The BBC caused a sensation with its coverage when the star’s Berkshire penthouse was searched for five hours last week.

The force revealed it had been contacted ‘weeks ago’ by a BBC reporter who had found out about their ongoing top-secret investigation into shock allegations that Sir Cliff had sexually assaulted a boy at a 1980s concert.

In an astonishing statement published late yesterday, police said they had been ‘reluctant’ to co-operate with the broadcaster but believed if they did not, the BBC would run the story anyway, potentially jeopardising the highly sensitive investigation.

South Yorkshire Police admitted striking an unprecedented deal whereby the BBC would be given exclusive information in advance of the raid – allowing them to show it live on TV – ‘in return for delaying publication’ of their story.

Sir Cliff – who strongly denies the allegations – also expressed anger that the BBC was tipped off about the search before he was.

The police also blasted the BBC for 
its ‘disappointing’ failure to make it clear the police had not been the
 original source of the story. And they called for an investigation into
 the source of the ‘original leak’ to the BBC, piling on the pressure.

South
 Yorkshire Police said: ‘A letter of complaint has been sent to the 
Director-General of the BBC, making it clear that the broadcaster 
appears to have contravened its editorial guidelines.’

Last night, Andrew Bridgen, Tory MP for North-West Leicestershire, said: ‘What the BBC has done

amounts to blackmail.

‘I
 think there should be an external inquiry to find out what happened, 
not an internal BBC one. This is shocking behaviour by a publicly funded
 national broadcaster.’

Last night, the BBC insisted: ‘A BBC journalist approached South Yorkshire Police with information about the investigation.

‘The BBC agreed to follow normal journalistic practice and not to publish a story that might jeopardise a police inquiry.’ 

Sources
 said the publicly funded broadcaster had ‘very unusually’ agreed to the
 police’s request on Friday to make clear they had not been the source.

Senior figures last night said the televised police raid broke all the rules on contact between press and police.

Rank
 and file police officers are said to be angry that the BBC – which 
suffered a crisis over its failure to expose Jimmy Savile’s abuse – 
‘bounced’ police into allowing cameras and even a helicopter to witness 
the search.

In other developments, it can be revealed that:

A planned screening of Sir Cliff’s much-loved film Summer Holiday could be pulled from the Bank Holiday schedule by ITV.

The
 1963 musical is due to be shown on ITV3 on Sunday afternoon during the 
Bank Holiday weekend.An insider said: ‘We will keep the situation under 
review and will make any schedule changes that we

deem
 appropriate.’ The drama surrounding Sir Cliff began on Thursday 
lunchtime when the BBC broadcast exclusive reports that police were 
searching a penthouse apartment in Sunningdale, Berkshire, belonging to 
the star.

Camera crews were 
already in place to watch teams of officers in unmarked cars arriving at
 the premises, while a news helicopter flew overhead.

It
 then emerged that South Yorkshire Police were carrying out the raid as 
part of an investigation into allegations that Richard had sexually 
abused a young boy during a Billy Graham rally at a Sheffield stadium in
 June 1985.

Under pressure to explain the circumstances of the televised raid, the BBC denied it had been tipped off by the force.

Instead,
 the police revealed they had been working with the BBC on the 
investigation before the pop star’s empty home was searched on Thursday.

As of last night, the BBC had received 77 complaints from members of the public about its handling of the case.

Of
 these, 46 said there had been too much coverage and the other 31 
expressed concern about how the Corporation had known about the police 
raid in advance.

The elected crime tsar for South Yorkshire, who holds the Chief Constable to account, last night stepped into the growing row.

Shaun
 Wright, the Labour Police and Crime Commissioner, is said to be taking 
the situation ‘very seriously’. He summoned his office’s chief executive
 and lawyer yesterday to start drawing up a timeline of what happened, 
and will hold a meeting tomorrow to decide what action to take next.

A
 spokesman for Mr Wright said: ‘In light of the outcomes of the Leveson 
Inquiry, the Commissioner will be looking very carefully at the 
catalogue of events which took place in relation to this investigation 
and any necessary actions will be taken.’ 

Cliff Richard has already spoken out against the BBC, claiming they were alerted to the raid before he was

Meanwhile, officers within the force were said to be ‘very, very angry’ about the collaboration with the BBC.

A
 police source said last night: ‘South Yorkshire Police felt they were 
being pushed into going in to investigate at this early stage. They felt
 very pressurised into doing it.

‘It’s
 totally unacceptable to brief the media prior to an investigation 
without the condition that there will be no media coverage until the 
police have been to an address and secured it.

'For the police to have turned up and found the BBC waiting there for them is unacceptable.’

The BBC declined to comment on allegations it pressurised the force.

Sir
 Cliff – who is said to be being supported during the crisis by his ‘Man
 Friday’ Father John McElynn – emerged from his Portugal villa early 
yesterday evening for a game of mixed doubles on his tennis court.

Smiling broadly, the star wore a red baseball cap and a white top with the number 72 on.

‘He was clearly trying to get away from his troubles doing what he loves most,’ said a near neighbour.

Sir
 Cliff said in a statement on Thursday that he had been aware of 
‘completely false’ allegations against him online for many months.
