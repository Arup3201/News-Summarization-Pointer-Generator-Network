Margaret O'Driscoll said she was with her son all night when quizzed by police after shots were fired in Chorlton, but then it turned out she had been texting him the whole time

A mother who gave her son an alibi for a crime he hadn’t committed has been locked up for lying to police.

Fabian O’Driscoll, 20, walked free from court after prosecutors dropped an attempted murder charge against him following a street shooting.

But his mother Margaret, 43, is now beginning an eight-month jail sentence for her needless effort to keep him out of trouble.

Police called at her home looking for 
her son minutes after shots were fired at a 37-year-old man he was 
feuding with on Chorlton’s Merseybank estate.

Ms O’Driscoll, of Waincliffe Avenue, Chorlton, lied to officers and told them he was at home at the time of the crime, sticking to her story in repeated accounts over several weeks - even after CCTV evidence proved he was on the street.

In an ironic twist, the same footage that revealed Ms O’Driscoll had lied about her son’s whereabouts, leading to her conviction, also cleared him.

Fabian O’Driscoll was wearing light-coloured clothing on the night of the shooting - and while the victim had identified him as responsible, the shooter was dressed entirely in black.

Last month, on the day he was due to face trial, the Crown Prosecution Service dropped its case against Fabian O ‘Driscoll, who had been arrested and charged last year.

Meanwhile, Ms O’Driscoll admitted perverting the course of justice, and has now been jailed for eight months.

Hours 
before the .32 bullet was fired at him on September 23, the target of 
the shooting turned up at the home Mr O’Driscoll shares with his mum 
armed with two rottweilers, but no-one was in.

Manchester
 Crown Court heard that the two men crossed paths at Merseybank Avenue 
at 9.30pm that night, when Mr O’Driscoll was part of a group of ten men.
 In the stand-off that followed someone shouted ‘get the ting’ - meaning
 get the gun - and a shot was fired at the victim.

In a text she sent Fabian, Ms O’Driscoll said: 'I told the police you went out at ten - you were in all day’.

He replied with a ‘smiley face’ emoticon, saying ‘luv u mum, ur the best’.

Helen Richardson, defending, said: 'She says she instinctively responded to police in a protective manner to her son.'

Judge Michael Henshell, said: 'The public must realise that to give false alibis will always be dealt with by prison sentences.'

Fabian O’Driscoll insists his mother thought she was telling police the truth.

That is despite the fact the former 
office worker, a mother-of-three from Moss Side, pleaded guilty to lying
 to officers in court.

O’Driscoll,
 20, said: 'I did nothing wrong and she did nothing wrong. I just feel 
disgraced by the system. She was gobsmacked when she was first arrested 
and they pursued and pursued the case.

'My mum didn’t lie intentionally. When she told the police I was at home, that was what she believed.

'I am a grown man I don’t tell my mum every time I leave the house. She thought I was at home.

'She
 pleaded guilty because she couldn’t take any more of the stress and 
worry. She’s never been to prison before. It’s upsetting for everyone. 
Going to be prison will be a huge ordeal for her.

'But I know she’ll cope because she’s a strong woman.'

Margaret O'Driscoll, 43, was jailed for eight months at Manchester Crown Court for her needless effort to keep her son out of trouble.
