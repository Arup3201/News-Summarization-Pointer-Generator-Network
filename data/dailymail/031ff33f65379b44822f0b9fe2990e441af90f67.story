A U.S. politician has resigned after it was revealed he had sent suggestive and harassing text messages to a married female 
lawyer, who he called a ‘sexxxy mama’.

Richard Steinberg, 39,
a Florida House Representative, sent dozens of messages last autumn to Assistant U.S. Attorney Marlene 
Fernandez-Karavetsos, 37.

Mr Steinberg, a married father of a young daughter, has known Mrs Fernandez-Karavetsos professionally for 15 years but did not mention who the creepy messages were from.

Married man: Rep. Richard Steinberg , pictured with his wife Micky in 2008, resigned from the House after it was revealed he had been sending creepy text messages to Assistant U.S. Attorney Marlene Fernandez-Karavetsos in Florida

He resigned from his post on Friday after returning to Florida from Washington when news of the story broke in the Miami Herald.

He asked for privacy while he deals with his personal affairs.

'The events of the past week have been difficult for my family, for me and for everyone involved,' Steinberg said in a written statement.

'As I did earlier this week, I want to once again, very directly and sincerely, apologize to everyone I have hurt.'

Mr Steinberg had earlier said sorry for ‘sending inappropriate and 
unsolicited messages’ and said he ‘regrets’ disrespecting the woman, her
husband and his constituents.

Steinberg, a Democratic state 
representative since 2008, admitted sending unsolicited texts to Mrs 
Fernandez-Karavetsos, an assistant U.S. attorney in Miami.

Federal
authorities were investigating the messages as a possible stalking 
case, an offense that carries a maximum one-year jail sentence.

Rep. Perry Thurston said: 'We're
all concerned about him. We care about him but I think that his family 
comes first and he made a decision based on his family and the fact that
he wanted to just bring all the speculation to an end.

I want to once again, very directly and sincerely, apologize to everyone I have hurt.

'He was one of our best members. He was one who was committed to the process and everyone in the caucus loved and loves him.'

Mrs Fernandez-Karavetsos is married 
to George Karavetsos, also a federal prosecutor and chief of the Miami 
U.S. attorney's narcotics section

In
a meeting with investigators, the attorney said she knew Steinberg 'in a
professional non-intimate way' and provided screen shots of the 
numerous messages on her phone.

According to the warrant filed in 
Miami-Dade County Circuit Court, investigators traced dozens of text 
messages sent under the user name 'itsjustme24680' to the politician's 
home in Miami Beach.

Sinister: Steinberg sent the messages from a phone that disguised the number but this was traced to his internet account

The number associated with that identity was a 'spoof,' according to investigators, meaning the true phone number was hidden on the victim's phone.

The search warrant details some of the texts, which began in August, and show that Mrs Fernandez-Karavetsos tried numerous times to get the sender to stop.

'Sexxxy mama?' read one text.

'How do I know you?' Mrs Fernandez-Karavetsos responded.

Later itsjustme wrote: 'Good morning!'

'Leave me alone' the prosecutor responded.

'Is that any way to treat a friend? LOL' came the response.

Then Mrs Fernandez-Karavetsos wrote: 'This is the last time I'm going to ask, you've been texting long enough- who is this?'

'Considering we're both married parents, probably best I not answer that at this point,' he wrote in reply.

Mrs Fernandez-Karavetsos, her husband and the U.S. Attorney's Office declined to comment on the resignation.

Rep Scott Plakon said Steinberg did the right thing by resigning.

He said: 'We do a lot of important things up here, but I'm glad he's going to attend to his family because that's more important than a lot of other stuff.

'I wish him the best.'
