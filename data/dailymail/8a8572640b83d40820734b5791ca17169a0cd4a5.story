An airline magnate told a court today how he paid for crooked tycoon Asil Nadir to live in luxury as he defended himself against £29million theft charges.

Turkish
businessman Hamat Bagana, gave 70-year-old-Nadir a total of £4.5m, which was 
used to rent a Mayfair townhouse, pay lawyers’ bills and buy a £44,000 
silver Range Rover Vogue for his 28-year-old wife Nur.

The 71- year- old, said it had been an ‘honour and a 
privilege’ and his ‘moral duty’ to support Nadir, who was a ‘hero’ to 
his generation.

Nadir, now 70, claims he has been penniless since the collapse of his Polly Peck business empire in the early 1990s and has not had a bank account or credit card since.

Prosecutors say this represents a ‘straightforward sham’ designed to hide his true wealth from the authorities.

Nadir is fighting attempts to reclaim nearly £29m he was convicted of stealing from the firm earlier this year following a mammoth seven-month trial.

He was originally due to stand trial over the missing millions in 1993, but fled to his native norther Cyprus before the case against him began.

Mr Bagana, who owns Turksih airline Onur Air, claims he handed over £4.5m to the former Polly Peck boss as a gesture of generosity for promoting business in Turkey and northern Cyprus.

Mr Bagana, who first met Nadir around 25 years ago, said: ‘When Mr Nadir made the decision to return to London he asked me a question.

‘He said this is going to be a long and expensive process.

‘He said, “I don’t have the resources to provide for that process."

‘Then he asked me whether I would support him, help him in that respect and I answered him by saying I would do that.

‘A second matter was related to the living standards in London.

‘Because I was going to provide the finances for that purpose he asked me this question, not quite so directly but in a way.

'I answered him by saying, “When you return to London you must live by the standards that you had in the past when you used to live in London, that you have been used to.

‘”I will provide the finances to make sure you are able to do that.'

'However, I was personally against his idea of coming back to London.’

Asked what had expected to get out of giving Nadir the money, he replied: ‘He didn’t give me anything other than his friendship.’

Questioned further about his motives, he said: ‘Mr Nadir is a hero to my generation.

‘The initiatives he started in both northern Cyprus and Turkey in his time have been responsible for the current economic success of both countries, which he did under the umbrella of his company PPI.’ 

Mr Bagana told the court he had visited Nadir’s northern Cyprus home several times and had found it to be ‘tastefully furnished but chiefly economical.’ 

The two discussed wine and champagne, business and politics, he added.

Nadir claims the only work he has done since 1993 is to work as a modestly-paid consultant for the Cyprus Today newspaper.

At the conclusion of his trial in August this year, Nadir was convicted of 10 counts of theft relating to the disappearance of £28.89m - around £61.6m in today’s money - between 1987 and 1990.

He was cleared of three counts alleging he stole £6.5m.

Nadir, of Eaton Square, Belgravia, central London, denied 13 specimen counts of theft.

Prosecutors said the specimen represented the theft of £146,050,000 and US$6,424,724 through 64 transactions.

Mr Bagana is trying to retrieve the £250,000 security he paid for Nadir’s bail on his return to the UK.

Later, Nadir’s sister Bilge Nevzat gave evidence by videolink from Northern Cyprus.

She said Nadir had not worked while in exile. She said: 'He was stuck in half an island that was not recognised by anyone.'

The hearing was adjourned to Friday.

After the case, Nadir’s wife Nur, 28, said reports that she was in Jordan were untrue.

She said: 'I am in Cyprus and I am thinking of moving to Istanbul.'
