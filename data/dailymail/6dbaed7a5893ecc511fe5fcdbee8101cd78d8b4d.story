Roy Keane has been questioned by police after he allegedly got into a row with a taxi driver

Roy Keane has been questioned under caution over an alleged road rage rant with a taxi driver at a set of traffic lights.

The former Manchester United star was said to have launched into a foul-mouthed tirade and made obscene gestures after jumping out his Range Rover in Altrincham, Greater Manchester.

Fateh Kerar, 44, claims the row last month was sparked when he and his female passenger spotted the TV pundit at a cash machine in nearby Hale.

He says he said 'hello' to the 43-year-old and asked him to 'smile' before Keane got into his car and began following his taxi.

It is then alleged that when the cars stopped at traffic lights an 'angry' Keane, who lives in Bowdon, Cheshire, got out and started acting 'very aggressive'. 

Police launched an investigation into the incident at 11.30am on January 30 and Keane was interviewed under caution by officers at a police station earlier this month.

A Greater Manchester Police spokesperson said: 'Mr Keane was interviewed under caution at a police station on February 3.

'We are currently in contact with the CPS about this matter.'

They added that the Crown Prosecution Service will make a decision about whether the assistant manager of Republic of Ireland will face any charges.

However, a CPS spokesperson said they had not received any information from police so they were unable to comment further.

Mr Kerar, 44, claims he was left 'shaking and terrified' by Keane's behaviour.

'He got out of his car in the middle of the road, held two fingers up and walked out in front of me He was pointing and swearing and being very aggressive,' he said.

'He shouldn't be allowed to treat people that way. There were lots of people stood around who couldn't believe what they were seeing.'

Keane refused to comment when questioned by reporters last month.
