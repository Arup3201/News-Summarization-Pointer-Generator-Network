The American news anchor who sensationally quit her job at state-funded Russia Today on air earlier this month has spoken out for the first time about her bold decision and how the channel’s coverage of President Putin sending troops into Ukraine was the final straw for her.

After working out of RT's Washington, DC bureau, for two and a half years, Connecticut-born Liz Wahl said she knew she had to quit.

‘I’d looked the other way as the network smeared America for the sake of making the Kremlin look better by comparison, while it sugarcoated atrocities by one brutal dictator after another,’ she told Politicio Magazine.

Connecticut-born Liz Wahl who sensationally quit her job at state-funded Russia Today on air earlier this month has spoken out for the first time about her bold decision and how the channel's coverage of events in Ukraine that was the final straw for her

When Russia invaded Ukraine, she said she finally came to see just how dangerous a propaganda tool the network was and so she resigned live on TV as a form of protest.

In closing statements during her 5 p.m. broadcast on March 5, Wahl said: ‘I cannot be part of a network funded by the Russian government that whitewashes the actions of Putin.’

‘I am proud to be an American and believe in disseminating the truth. And that is why, after this newscast, I am resigning.’

Afterwards as Wahl got up from the anchor chair and started to gather her belongings, she said her heart was racing as she was told her Russian news director wanted to see her in his office.

Despite misgivings about joining a network funded by the Russian government, Wahl joined Russia Today in September 2011 after it was pitched to her as a channel that would take on the 'stories the mainstream media ignores'

‘He asked me why I did it, as though I had some reason other than the one I had just announced on live TV. I explained that it really was because of the propaganda RT was pushing about Ukraine,’ she said.

Wahl then left the building and is currently searching for work opportunities with media organizations more dedicated to reporting the truth.

She had joined Russia Today in September 2011 despite misgivings about working for a news network funded by the Russian government, after she was told she would be allowed to take on ‘stories the mainstream media ignores’.

Wahl said she was given no indication that the news would be influenced by Russian politics, but she found it strange that almost all the on-air presenters were American, while her news director was Russian.

No sooner had she started, than colleagues warned her that she would need to let go of any preconceived notions and her journalistic principles.

Wahl has accused the state-funded Russia Today of deliberately smearing America in order to make the Kremlin - and Putin - look good

During her first week in the job the Occupy Wall Street movement began in New York City’s Zuccotti Park and her Russian news director announced that it was going to be their top story.

The network’s coverage deliberately sought to portray America as a country in the midst of a popular uprising, she said and they ‘continued to suck it dry’ even after the numbers of protesters had dwindled.

At the same time, she noted that protests in Moscow about alleged election fraud were all but ignored by the network.

In her resignation, Wahl spoke about how personal the developments in the Ukraine were to her.

Wahl's
 grandparents had emigrated to the United States from Hungary during 
that country's revolution in 1956 because of the threat of Soviet 
forces.

In the wake of her on-air resignation, Wahl appeared on The Colbert Report with Stephen Colbert

In an interview with the Daily Beast, Wahl said the Kremlin's influence over RT was not overt but 'in order to succeed there you don't question'.

She said: 'In a way you kind of suppress any concerns that you have and play the game.'

'It actually makes 
me feel sick that I worked there. It’s not a sound news organization, 
not when your agenda is making America look bad,' she said.

In the wake of Wahl's resignation, the network responded with a statement posted on their website.

'When
 a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her 
organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances 
with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a 
professional.

'But when someone makes a big public show of a personal 
decision, it is nothing more than a self-promotional stunt. We wish Liz 
the best of luck on her chosen path,' the statement read.
