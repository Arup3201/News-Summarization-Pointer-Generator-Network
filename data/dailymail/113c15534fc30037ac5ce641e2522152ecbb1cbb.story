Concern: The opening ceremony for the Commonwealth Games had faced disaster over a music copyright issue

The opening ceremony for the Commonwealth Games faced disaster yesterday – after the organisers realised they did not have permission to use a track by one of the world’s biggest pop stars.

For more than six months, 500 dancers have been rehearsing to the Calvin Harris hit Feel So Close.

But with just five days to go until the showcase event in Glasgow, which will be watched by one billion people, they were told they would have to learn a brand new routine.

Games organisers claimed Harris, 30, had failed to respond to their request for permission to use  his tune – so it would have to  be ditched.

But last night, after being contacted The Mail on Sunday, the multi-millionaire DJ and producer gave the green light for the song to be used.

His US-based spokesman said: ‘Calvin has given his permission for the dance troupe to use his track. It has been cleared and approved.’

Dancers had revealed their shock after being told on Friday by events firm Jack Morton Worldwide – which masterminded the Manchester Commonwealth Games ceremonies – that they would have to perform to a new track.

One said: ‘Everyone booed – we were absolutely gutted.

‘The producer said Calvin was approached last November.  He said he was told Calvin’s publicist had passed the request to him but he hadn’t come back.

‘We were pretty angry and really anxious about getting new music at this short notice. We’re amateurs and what we’re doing is a lot of pressure so we need things to run smoothly.’

Now based in Los Angeles, Harris, who recently broke up with girlfriend Rita Ora, is estimated to have earned  £27 million last year.
