A Ukrainian man believes he has the longest eyelashes in the world - and credits the incredible growth to a special food which he keeps a close-guarded secret.

Valery Smagliy, 58, from Kiev, says he noticed their increased length after changing his diet and thinks the key to their transformation could earn him a fortune.

He has kept the amazing-looking lashes until now as he enjoys the attention they attract from women - but says he has finally decided to trim them.

Secret recipe: Valery Smagliy saw his eyelashes grow to an enormous length after changing his diet and he says he wants to keep the food item responsible for the growth a secret 

Mr Smagliy said: 'I started eating something and noticed that my eyelashes really started growing quickly at the same time, and I'm thinking of marketing it so I'm not giving away the secret of what it is.'

After noticing how jealous women were of the natural enormous eyelashes, he realised his secret could end up being lucrative.

He added: 'Women would stop me in the street and ask me what the secret was, they can see that they are real and not fake.

'And whether it's man or woman, most people don't seem to pay much attention when I'm talking to them because they're always looking at my eyelashes.

'But to be honest they are just heavy now and my eyelids are getting sore. And it's also difficult to see properly with huge grey eyelashes in front of my eye.

Before trimming them he plans to visit the local registry office of the Guinness Book of Records to have them officially measured. 

The lashes currently stand at around 3cm long but Smagliy has decided to trim them as he has tired of the reaction they provoke

According to the Guinness Book of Records, the longest eyelash ever recorded was 6.99 cm (2.75 in) long and belonged to American Stuart Muller's left upper lid. 

The eyelash was measured in Gainesville, Florida, USA on 7 December 2007.

Pondering on his decision to have them cut, Mr Smagliy added: 'I suppose I could go for the world record, but to be honest what's the point? 

'I prefer to be able to see better and I plan to get them cut in a professional salon so I reckon they will still look pretty good afterwards.'

The director of the National Registry of Records, Lana Vetrova said they plan to announce the official length of the eyelashes next week.
