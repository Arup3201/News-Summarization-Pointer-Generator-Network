This vibrant picture looks like a work of art created by a painter with an eye for colour.

In fact, it shows the spectacular effect created when 'rainbow' eucalyptus trees shed their bark, revealing bright splashes of green, orange and purple beneath.

The myriad shades on the trunks were captured in close-up by a nature photographer on the island of Kauai, Hawaii.

The trees shed patches of bark at different times throughout the year, revealing a bright green layer.

The inner bark then darkens and matures into shades of blue, orange and maroon.

Nature photographer Warren Krupsaw, 70, who went in search of the trees while celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary on Hawaii, said witnessing the effect up close left him stunned.

'As a nature photographer I had seen pictures of these remarkable trees before, and I was hoping to spot some on my own,' he said.

'I had spoken to someone who knew of them and I had an idea where to find them on the island.

'Amazement': The photographs were taken after an afternoon rain shower, with the 'saturated' bark resulting in 'saturated' colour

'When I first saw the trees, my initial 
thought was one of amazement - I had never seen such colourful bark,' 
said Mr Krupsaw, who took the photographs just after an afternoon rain 
shower.

The photographer, from Bluemont, Virginia, said he was delighted with the results.

'It was clearing after a brief late-afternoon rain shower, exactly the conditions a serious photographer would hope for as the saturated bark resulted in saturated colours,' he said.

Mr Krupsaw said he had been unsure whether a photograph could do justice to the spectacular effect of the trees in real life.

'I only know what catches my eye,' he said.

'Most people I've spoken to about the trees have trouble believing such a thing is real.'

The tall trees are found in the northern hemisphere, and its natural distribution spans Indonesia and South East Asia.
