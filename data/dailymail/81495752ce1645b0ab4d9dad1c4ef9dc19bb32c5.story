A Battle Creek man who was granted a new trial after his conviction in the 1995 fire-related deaths of two young brothers in southern Michigan has been freed following a plea deal in the case.

Andrew Babick, 48, who had been serving a life sentence for felony murder, left the Calhoun County courthouse Wednesday, the Battle Creek Enquirer reported.

Babick was granted a new trial in November after the Michigan Innocence Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School argued he was convicted because of faulty science pointing to arson.

'I want to thank you guys with all of my heart,' Babick said as he embraced family in the courthouse parking lot. 'I am so happy that it is finally over. I am sad for the family but happy that it is over.'

Rather than going to trial, Babick pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in an agreement with the state attorney general's office.

Babick had already served 18 years in prison, more than the 15-year maximum penalty for the new charge, so Judge Sarah Lincoln ordered his release. 

He was accused of starting a house fire in September 1995 because he was mad at the quality of crack cocaine he had bought from a man at the house earlier that day. Babick denied that.

Two adults escaped, but three-year-old Le'Daryus Fields and two-year-old Le'Tonio Briggs died. 

Babick was convicted and then sentenced December 20, 1996. 

In his guilty plea, Babick said he fell asleep on a couch on the porch of the house while smoking a cigarette.

Imran Syed, an attorney for the Innocence Clinic, said Babick, who entered prison with a drug addition, is a changed man and has a nearly flawless prison record.

He has written childrens’ books with Biblical messages, completed a two-year correspondence course and worked three years to train for adoption of retired Greyhound racing dogs, he said.

Convicted: Babick was accused of setting a house on fire - and killing the boys - after he became angry at a drug dealer who sold him poor quality crack cocaine. But he said he fell asleep with a cigarette on the couch

'He has reformed himself,' Syed said.

Before he was released, the mother and sister of the dead boys spoke to the court and told the Enquirer that she struggled to understand how Babick was walking free. 

'The last time I was in a courtroom was when this man was sentenced for murdering my two sons,' Jacqueline Caldwell said. 

'How do I end up with two deaths and he can come out and hug his family? I was told he would get two life sentences. I told him I would forgive him but I would never forget.'

LeKiya Fields, 24, said she was only five when her brothers were killed.

'I forgive this man, but after taking two lives he can make up for the time that was lost, but I can't,' she said. 'I am reminded of my brothers in an obituary.'
