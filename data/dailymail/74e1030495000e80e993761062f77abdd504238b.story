'Supergran' Ann Timson foiled a raid on a jewellery store by lashing out at armed raiders using only her handbag

'Supergran' Ann Timson, who foiled a raid on a jewellery store by lashing out at armed raiders
using only her handbag, has been honoured.

Then aged 71, the pensioner was shopping in Northampton when she noticed a commotion coming from the direction of Michael Jones Jewellers.

She spotted three mopeds parked nearby
with riders on board, while three other people wearing crash helmets 
and armed with lump hammers were smashing the store’s windows.

Undeterred, Mrs Timson ran towards the mob and began swinging her handbag at one of the riders, who made off.

She then swung her handbag at those smashing the window to try and halt the raid - and the robbers fled the scene.

But one of the would-be thieves was so
distracted by Mrs Timson he fell off his moped, after which she 
continued to lash him with her handbag until other members of the public
intervened.

The man was detained until police arrived and took him into custody.

Mrs Timson’s brave exploits saw her hailed as a 'handbag heroine' and earned her international publicity with footage of her confronting the gang seen by millions of people around the world.

In an interview with NBC last year she insisted she was not a hero but said she had sore legs the next day 
after her lung-busting run down the street because she suffers from 
arthritis.

'The adrenaline was going. I think I was very very angry that they would dare to do that in daylight. Why should they get away with it?' she told the show host.

'I'm not a hero, a heroine or supergran. I'm just a mum that went in thinking a kid was being hit.

'The adrenaline got going the second thought was how dare they do a daylight robbery. I was made.'

She has now been awarded the Queen's Commendation for Bravery.

Meanwhile, Pc Bill Barker who was swept to his death in the Cumbrian floods was honoured with a posthumous Queen's Commendation for Bravery.

The officer plunged into the swollen waters of the River Derwent in the early hours of November 20, 2009, after venturing on to Northside Bridge in Workington to check for casualties below.

The father of four had been sent to the spot to assess the situation after police received reports that the bridge had begun to collapse.

Arriving at the area in darkness, the 44-year-old heard a vehicle may have fallen into the water so he and a colleague stepped out on to the bridge, realising once they were on it that its central section had caved in fully.

Seeing no casualties, they started to leave - but Pc Barker fatally looked over the parapet to check once more that no vehicle or its occupants were visible.

At this moment, the area of the bridge where he was standing broke away and he was carried off by the water.

He was honoured 'for sacrificing his own life while trying to save others'.

The citation for his commendation read: 'While recognising the obvious risks to himself, Pc Barker took steps to check for casualties in need of assistance, and paid the ultimate price for his selfless actions.'

Adan Abobaker was awarded a Queen's Gallantry Medal after diving into the River Thames in London in November 2010 to rescue a woman from the freezing water after hearing the screams of a passerby.

Braving the high tide, strong 
undercurrents and poor visibility, Mr Abobaker dived beneath the water 
several times before reaching her and swimming to safety with her.

He was later treated for hypothermia, but the woman he had rescued made a full recovery.

Meanwhile, former policeman Ken McGonigle was awarded the same medal, but posthumously, for preventing an attack by insurgents in Afghanistan.

He was working as a mentor 
to the Afghan Police in Musa Qala, Helmand Province, on 7 August 2010 
when he was alerted by his Afghan interpreter to an imminent threat.

The father-of-four ran outside to see 
an insurgent armed with an RPG rocket launcher, looking to kill all 
occupants of a helicopter about to lift off.

Mr McGonigle, from Magheramason in 
Northern Ireland’s Co Londonderry, knew that a number of service 
personnel were on board so immediately drew his pistol and engaged the 
gunman at close quarters.

As another insurgent emerged he continued to engage until they disappeared and he could alert colleagues to the danger.

He then led a party of marines to 
where the gunmen were located and the group found four insurgents armed 
with automatic weapons and RPGs.

Mr McGonigle was killed in the ensuing fire fight.

His citation read: 'Without his intervention it is likely that a number of British lives would have been lost.'

Lieutenant Commander Ian Molyneux received a posthumous George Medal

A Royal Navy officer murdered trying 
to stop a sailor carrying out a gun rampage aboard a nuclear-powered 
submarine has been awarded one of the highest medals for bravery.

Lieutenant Commander Ian Molyneux 
receives a posthumous George Medal - second only to the George Cross - 
for attempting to tackle Able Seaman Ryan Donovan as he ran amok on HMS 
Astute while it was docked in Southampton.

His widow Gillian said she felt 'extremely proud and humbled' to know that her husband’s 'remarkable 
bravery' has been recognised.

Lt Cdr Molyneux, 36, a father of four 
from Standish, Wigan, tried to disarm Donovan after hearing shots on 
board the submarine on April 8 last year, but was shot in the head.

The gunman was then wrestled to the 
ground by Southampton City Council’s leader Royston Smith and chief 
executive Alistair Neill, who were visiting the submarine at the time.

In a letter to Lt Cdr Molyneux’s 
widow, First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope said: 'In giving his 
life to save others Ian demonstrated courage of the highest possible 
order. His selfless actions displayed incredible presence of mind and 
singular bravery.'

Donovan was jailed for at least 25 
years in September for murdering Lt Cdr Molyneux and attempting to 
murder Lieutenant Commander Christopher Hodge, Petty Officer Christopher
Brown, and Chief Petty Officer David McCoy.

Mr Smith and Mr Neill are also 
awarded the George Medal in the Civilian Gallantry List today for their 
heroic actions in grabbing the gun from Donovan.
