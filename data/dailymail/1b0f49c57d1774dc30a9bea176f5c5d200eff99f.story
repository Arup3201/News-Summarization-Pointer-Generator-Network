You might think the Tesla Model S is pretty impressive as it is - but one of the world’s most popular electric cars just got a whole lot cooler.

An owner of one of the vehicles has discovered a hidden ‘James Bond’ mode that allows you to turn the car into 007’s famous submersible spy car - on the dashboard at least.

The Easter Egg also lets you set the ‘depth’ of the car (in leagues under the sea, of course) - although it’s probably not advisable to actually test out its sea-faring capabilities.

A Youtube user has revealed a secret Easter Egg in the Tesla Model S car. The US company has included a 'James Bond' mode on the dashboard (shown). Holding the 'T' button brings up an access code window. Typing in '007' then changes the view of the car on the dashboard

The secret feature was posted to YouTube by Model S owner Josh Heffner.

To activate it, users need to hold down the ‘T’ button on the main dashboard of the car.

A window will then appear that asks for an access code, and by typing in zero-zero-seven, James Bond mode can be activated.

Where the image of a Model S car on the dashboard normally appears, instead now the famous Lotus Espirit from the 1977 James Bond movie The Spy Who Loved Me is seen.

 The Tesla Model S dashboard, shown, allows users to select and alter different features of the car

Battery 60kwh

Power 380hp

Transmission Single speed

0-60mph 5.9 seconds

Top speed 120mph (195km/h)

Range 240 miles (385km)

CO2 emissions Zero (road tax exempt) 

Mr Heffner explained that this was a ‘technician login’ that was ‘normally where servicing will get access to their menus and make changes.’

He admits, though, that he hasn’t ‘really found a good way to get rid of it yet’ without having to reset the dashboard.

Interestingly, Tesla CEO Elon Musk actually bought the iconic Bond submarine car back in October 2013 for £560,000 ($866,000).

The Lotus was nicknamed 'Wet Nellie' during filming and was built by a former Navy SEAL at a cost of around £65,000 ($100,000) - the equivalent to £325,000 ($500,000) today.

Although Roger Moore starred as Bond in the film, the submarine car was driven by retired Navy Seal Don Griffin during underwater filming.

There were actually several different Lotus Esprits used to film the sequence where Roger Moore and Barbara Bach escape the enemy by driving off a pier into the sea.

The car that went up for sale is the only one that worked as a self-propelled submarine.

The Easter Egg changes the car on the dashboard into the famous submersible Lotus Espirit from the 1977 movie The Spy Who Loved Me (pictured). And the depth - in 'leagues under the sea' - can also be selected. This is a reference to the 1870 book from French writer Jules Verne

The Tesla Model S (shown) is a full-sized electric five-door, produced by Tesla Motors. It was introduced in June 2012, and can drive 240 miles (385km) on a single charge
