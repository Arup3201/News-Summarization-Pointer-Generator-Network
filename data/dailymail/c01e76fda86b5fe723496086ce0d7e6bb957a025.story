John Terry racially abused an opponent after being taunted about his extra-marital affair with a team-mate’s girlfriend, a court heard yesterday.

The former England football captain called rival player Anton Ferdinand a ‘f****** black c***’ and a ‘f****** k***head’ after Ferdinand goaded him for sleeping with model Vanessa Perroncel, it was alleged.

Ferdinand – brother of Manchester United star Rio – did not realise he 
had been racially insulted until he saw footage of the incident on 
YouTube, Westminster Magistrates’ Court was told.

The Premier League defender is said to have reacted after Ferdinand 
accused him of ‘s******* Bridge’s missus’ – a reference to his 
relationship with Miss Perroncel who was dating his former colleague, 
Wayne Bridge.

Evidence: Anton Ferdinand leaves the court yesterday with friends

The incident came in front of 20,000 fans – as well as a TV audience of 
two million – in a clash between Terry’s Chelsea and Ferdinand’s Queens 
Park Rangers on October 23 last year.

The row began after Terry failed to return the ball to QPR during the 
last few minutes of a tense game at the latter team’s ground in West 
London. Annoyed, Ferdinand began to make lewd ‘fist-pumping’ hand 
gestures at 31-year-old Terry.

His opponent understood the gesture to ‘refer to the well-publicised 
allegation’ that he had had ‘an extra-marital affair with a team-mate’s 
wife’, prosecutor Duncan Penny said.

In response, Terry began shouting at Ferdinand, using a string of swear 
words, Mr Penny said. The prosecutor added: ‘The words were abusive and 
insulting in a straightforward sense.’

They were ‘uttered as an abusive insult demonstrating hostility based on Mr Ferdinand’s membership of a racial group’.

Ferdinand said he had not heard the word ‘black’ – only swear words that he reacted to by raising the issue of Terry’s affair.

After the game, Terry called Ferdinand to his team’s changing room, 
where he is alleged to have said: ‘It’s handbags innit – it’s what 
happens on the pitch.’

The pair shook hands but – after watching footage of the incident with 
his then girlfriend – Ferdinand believed that Terry had made a racist 
comment and became ‘livid’ over what had happened.

No special treatment: Terry was ordered to take his place in the dock after his lawyer asked if he could sit beside him

When he was questioned by police over the incident, Terry admitted using
a racist jibe but claimed he had said it ironically, believing 
Ferdinand had just accused him of making that same remark.

‘Whilst footballers are used to industrial language, saying racist terms
is completely unacceptable whatever the situation,’ he said. ‘I was 
completely taken aback by this remark as I have never been accused of 
something like that.’

The England defender added that he had not been offended by the taunts 
about his alleged affair, because ‘it’s not the first time I’ve heard 
it, so it’s with a pinch of salt’.

Terry, a married father of two who earns £160,000 a week, denies a 
racially aggravated public order offence, which carries a maximum fine 
of £2,500.

Fraternal affection: Rio Ferdinand tweeted support to his brother Anton ahead of the hearing

More than 100 photographers and cameramen lined the entrance to the West London Court awaiting his arrival yesterday morning.

Wearing a tailored grey suit and pink tie, he was bundled by his 
security team through a side door to avoid the huge crowd of press and 
public at the front of the court.

Scandal: Terry's alleged comments came in response to taunts by the other player about his alleged affair with an ex-team-mate's girlfriend, Vanessa Perroncel, pictured, the prosecution said

At the start of the hearing, the England player asked if he could sit 
next to his barrister rather than in the dock. Chief magistrate Howard 
Riddle rejected his request although he briefly permitted him to leave 
the dock so he could watch as footage of the incident was played to the 
court.

Giving evidence yesterday, Ferdinand said: ‘When someone brings your 
colour into it, it takes it to another level and it’s very hurtful.’

But he said he had initially avoided giving a statement to police 
because he wanted the incident to be dealt with by officials at the 
Football Association.

‘This is a footballing issue that happened on the football pitch where 
we work,’ he said. He denied a suggestion that he went to police only 
when persuaded to by his publicist Justin Rigby, who also works for Rio.
 

Ferdinand said: ‘No, I made up my own mind, I wanted to do it.’

The decision to investigate the former England captain was taken when 
police received a complaint from a member of the public after the 
Premier League match.

A lip reader gave evidence saying she had studied the footage and confirmed the use of the word ‘black’.

Terry, whose Chelsea team won the Champions League and the FA Cup in 
May, was part of the England side that reached the quarter finals of 
Euro 2012 last month. He was stripped of the national team’s captaincy 
for a second time this February after the date for his race row trial 
was set.

Ferdinand has played for West Ham, Sunderland and QPR. His brother was Terry’s former defensive partner in the national side.

Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence, attended yesterday’s hearing and sat in the public gallery.

The trial, which is expected to last five days, continues.
