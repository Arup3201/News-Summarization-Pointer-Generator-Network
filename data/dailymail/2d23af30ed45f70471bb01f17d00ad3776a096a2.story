Suicidal: Laura Johnson, 20, leaving court today where she told jurors she has self-harmed since 14 and tried to kill herself six times

A millionaire's daughter accused of 
driving looters around while they robbed people at knifepoint in last 
year's riots was 'obsessed' with the drug dealer she claims forced her 
to be his getaway driver, a court heard today.

Laura Johnson, 20, was 'part and 
parcel' of the criminality of last summer's riots even though she had 
the chance to call the police and drive away from four men who had 
'effectively kidnapped' her, it is alleged.

But the straight-A university student 
behaved as she did because she was 'obsessed' with Emmanuel Okubote, 20 
and had 'fallen for him hard', a jury was told.

Johnson had gone to pick up her friend
Okubote, known as T-Man, from Curry's, in Bromley Road, Catford, south 
east London, when he and three other men wearing hooded tops, bandanas 
and balaclavas, got into the back of her car and ordered her to drive.

Sandy Canavan, prosecuting, told Inner
London Crown Court that even when Johnson found out crack dealer ‘T 
Man’ had been to prison it still did not put her off.

The student had begun a close 
friendship with Okubote during the summer after being introduced to him 
by a friend she met while a mental health unit outpatient.

Phone records revealed that straight-A
university student Johnson, made 80 phone calls to ‘T Man’ in the two 
weeks leading up to August 8th - dubbed the worst night of London’s 
riots last summer.

Johnson, who the jury has heard 
previously tried to kill herself, says she was too frightened to report 
the men or flee during their rioting on August 8.

The defendant denies being a willing 
participant in the gang as they drove around the Catford, Hither Green 
and Charlton areas of London while the men got in and out of the car to 
loot and rob people.

Miss Canavan said the student was making things up as she went along in her defence.

Johnson was in possession of mobile 
phones during her effective 'kidnap', which meant the four men believed 
she would not report them, the barrister said.

Miss Canavan said: 'The only reality 
is you were left with the phones as they (the men) were absolutely sure 
they weren't at any risk of you having access to those because you were 
very much part and parcel of what was taking place.'

Describing the calls Johnson is said to have made to Okubote, Miss Canavan told Johnson: '

Looking at the phone records it looks like you did all the running. Frankly, it looks like you are almost obsessed with him.

'You are constantly ringing him and if you don’t get through you’ll ring again and again determined until you succeed.'

Johnson, who suffers from mental health problems and has tried to kill herself seven times, replied: 'I disagree.

'When you are suicidal you do anything you can to get out of that mentality.'

The court heard Johnson, who claims 
she was raped by two men last July - a month before the riots - and had a
mental breakdown over that and the break up with her ex-boyfriend, even
exchanged flirty texts with ‘T Man’ the day they allegedly went on a 
looting spree.

Frenzy: Johnson's trial heard how hundreds of rioters scurried 'like wild rats' around Stone Lake Retail Park in Charlton (above)

The prosecution claim Johnson, then 
19, was one of hundreds of teenagers who scurried like ‘wild rats’ 
around an under-siege retail park in south east London.

A witness claims he saw the grammar 
school student loading a flatscreen TV into the boot of her car amid the
mayhem as her accomplices ran back and forth with stolen goods.

The defendant entered a petrol station alone that evening to pay for fuel and could have raised the alarm, Miss Canavan said.

'If you had the phones with you, you could have called the police yourself,' she said.

Johnson says looters threatened her and made her drive them around as they robbed people and shops during the summer riots

'I could have, yes,' answered the defendant.

'You could have texted anybody to indicate you were in trouble,' Miss Canavan added.

'I could have, yes,' replied Johnson.

'The reality is you would have got in touch with somebody to say 'I am in trouble, help'.'

The defendant answered 'No I wouldn't', and agreed with the barrister's suggestion that she was 'terrified'.

Johnson, from Orpington, south east 
London, denies three counts of burglary and three alternative counts of 
handling stolen goods.
