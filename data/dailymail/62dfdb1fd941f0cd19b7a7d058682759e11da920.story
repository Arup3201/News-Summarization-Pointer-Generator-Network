When Dele Alli was plucked from MK Dons by Tottenham Hotspur in a £5million deal on transfer deadline day, the name of one former Spurs youngster came to the minds of many - John Bostock.

Could the 18-year-old who has been lighting up League One this season avoid becoming yet another English starlet who failed to live up to expectations after moving to a big club?

MK Dons boss Karl Robinson has insisted in the past that the midfielder possesses a level of maturity beyond his tender years, and the question in the short term is whether Alli can keep his head down and maintain the level of performance that secured his transfer to Spurs in the first place.

For the most part against Bradford City, the evidence suggested yes. 

One thing is for sure, the surface at White Hart Lane will never be as bad as it was at  Valley Parade on Monday night - and Alli's attempts to bring a level of control to midfield were certainly hampered in the early exchanges.

Of course, there was always a chance that his touch suffered in the knowledge that, live on Sky Sports, there would be more eyes upon him than ever before in his short career.  Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino was, in all likelihood, watching on from somewhere.

And tiredness couldn't have helped either. It had, after all, been little over 48 hours since MK Dons played out a 0-0 draw at home to Bristol City.

MK Dons knew that a win would take them top of League One, while Bradford were hoping to end the night in the play-off places - and the first half was not exactly a classic.

Alli showed plenty of hustle and bustle, especially in his attempts to support lone striker Jonson Clarke-Harris at every available opportunity, but the first half was a struggle for the youngster.

Things started better after the interval. One lively run down the right, while ultimately futile, did successfully showcase the strength and speed.

Then, in the 54th minute, Alli opened the scoring after being assisted by the game's key player - the Valley Parade pitch.

Bradford goalkeeper Jordan Pickford scuffed what should have been a straightforward clearance right into the path of Clarke-Harris on the edge of the area, the striker squared to Alli, and he made no mistake in sliding the ball under the red-faced keeper.

Goal number 13 of the season, as cool as you like. Somewhere Pochettino would have been nodding approvingly.

Bradford, however, recently came back from a two-goal deficit to beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Compared to that, MK Dons at home is easy pickings, and just 15 minutes later they were ahead thanks to Billy Clark and James Hanson.

Alli took it upon himself to try and get his side back into the game. First he appeared at left back to halt an opposition attack, then at right back in attempt to drive the Dons forward.

But in the end it was defeat, and his fight to help MK Dons to promotion before his summer departure took something of a setback. 

One thing is for sure, though, Alli is definitely a talent. But if he is to succeed for Tottenham in the future, he will be far better off back on loan at Stadium MK next season - either in the Championship or League One - then warming the bench at White Hart Lane.
