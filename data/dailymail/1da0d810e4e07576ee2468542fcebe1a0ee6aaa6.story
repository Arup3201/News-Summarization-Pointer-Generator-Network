The UK's most photographic animal has been named - as this adorable pet pug. The dog, Rylo, beat 25 fellow finalists to be crowned the nation's most photogenic creature.

In the competition, held by photography company Venture, the pug posed for the camera in a bid to win the top prize.

Rylo's owners Craig Howlett-Wright and David Birks have been awarded a bucket-load of treats after he triumphed in the face of tough competition.

Not so ugly pug: Rylo beat 25 fellow finalists to be crowned the nation's most photogenic creature

Mr Howlett-Wright, from Rotherham, Yorkshire, said: 'We can't believe that Rylo has won the competition.

'He means such a lot to us so for the judges to choose him for the title is incredible.

'The photographer really captured his personality during our shoot, which is what makes the picture so special. The prize means we can have more of the pictures on our walls - we can't wait to choose them and get them home.

'It's incredible to think that Rylo's picture will be in studios around the world - the news hasn't sunk in yet.'

The couple have been handed a year's supply of dog food, vouchers, a VIP tour of Battersea Dogs & Cats Home, vouchers and £500 to spend on pet 'pawtrait'.

The competition was run in association with animal charity Battersea Dogs & Cats Home and Park Bench, with Venture donating £1 for each entry to Battersea.
