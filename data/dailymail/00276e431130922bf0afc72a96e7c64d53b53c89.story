Zara Phillips has become the first senior member of the Royal Family to sell photographs of their new baby to a celebrity magazine – for a reported fee of £150,000.

The Queen’s grand-daughter, her husband Mike Tindall and their five-week-old daughter Mia Grace are today plastered over 13 pages of Hello! magazine, as well as its front cover.

The Mail understands senior officials at Buckingham Palace were not made aware of the lucrative deal in advance and, tellingly, a spokesman for the Queen refused to comment publicly yesterday.

Zara’s willingness to strike a 
commercial deal over her daughter – who is 16th in line to the throne – 
will bring back uncomfortable memories of her brother’s decision to sell
 his wedding pictures to the same magazine for a reported £500,000.

The
 first official pictures of Mia were taken at Zara and Mike’s cottage on
 Princess Anne’s Gatcombe Park estate in Gloucestershire and come just 
days after their publicist denied they were planning to make money out 
of the birth.

Intriguingly, 
the Mail has learnt the deal was brokered late last week by the Olympic 
medal-winning equestrian’s management company, Sports and Entertainment 
Limited, whose managing director is none other than Zara’s brother Peter
 Phillips.

The accompanying 
interview sees Zara and Mike speak about Mia’s birth on January 17 and 
even reveal how Zara called her grandmother as soon as she returned home
 from hospital.

Asked 
whether Palace protocol obliged them to inform the Queen as soon as the 
baby was born, Mike says: ‘I sent a text to all the family. Zara is very
 close to her grandmother, so of course she made a phone call once we 
got back home.’

Former 
world champion three-day eventer Zara, 32, says Mia is ‘pretty relaxed 
and happy so far’ while Mike, 35, describes becoming a father as 
‘awesome’. The couple also reveal they aimed to conceive in time for a 
December or January birth as it will allow Zara to compete in August’s 
World Championships.

Former
 England rugby captain Mike says: ‘I can see that Z [his nickname for 
Zara] is itching to be out there again.’ Zara also says there is a 
Shetland pony lined up for her daughter to learn to ride.

Zara described her husband, here with her at Prince George's christening, as a 'hands-on' father, while he gushed: 'I still keeping looking at Mia and thinking "Oh! We made that!"'

Mia's second cousin Prince George was born at the private Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London

The
 interview was brokered by SEL, an Australian firm dealing in 
sponsorship and client management. Its small London office was set up in
 2012 by Peter.

Like her 
brother, Zara has no Royal title or taxpayer funding. She earns a living
 as a professional equestrian, funding her stables through sponsorship 
deals with firms including Land Rover and Rolex. Last night a source 
close to Zara insisted she and Mike had agreed to the deal as 
‘international sporting figures’ rather than members of the Royal 
Family.

They said: ‘It [the 
magazine deal] was not, initially, something they intended to do. The 
pictures had already been taken by an old schoolfriend of Zara when they
 were approached by Hello! and agreed to sign a deal. It was all very 
sudden.

‘I think Zara 
understands there will be a level of criticism directed at her but she 
clearly felt this was the best way to approach the level of interest in 
Mia and, of course, provide for her future.’

But
 lawyer Niri Shan, head of intellectual property and media and 
entertainment at Taylor Wessing, warned: ‘This is going to make it very 
difficult for them to protect the privacy of their baby when she is photographed in the future, outside of any specific issue of harassment.’

This is not the first time Zara or her family have struck a deal with Hello!:

In
 2002, Zara was paid a reported £125,000 for a photoshoot with her then 
boyfriend, the jockey Richard Johnson. She appeared in the magazine 
again following her 2011 wedding to Mike Tindall.

In
 2009, Mike gave an interview, telling Hello! about his relationship 
with Zara and saying he would propose ‘when the time is right’.

Last
 year, the former England rugby captain spoke again to the magazine 
about, among other things, his life within the Royal Family and how the 
Duchess of Cambridge was ‘a natural mother’.

In 1997, Zara and Peter’s father, Mark Phillips, sold pictures from his wedding to his second wife, Sandy Pflueger, to Hello!. The front cover featured the couple with the two young royals. Two years ago it emerged that they had split.

In 2008, Peter Phillips and his fiancée, Autumn Kelly, posed for a photographic spread in advance of their wedding, including 17 changes of clothes between them.

Peter and Autumn then sold the rights to the wedding for a reported £500,000, including handing over a family portrait featuring the Queen. Aides let it be known that the monarch was deeply unhappy with the decision, while senior members of the Royal Family spoke about feeling ‘betrayal’.
