You won’t be able to blame the treacherous weather now, if you wanted to avoid spending Christmas with the in-laws. And there's pretty much no chance of a White Christmas on the East Coast.

Holiday travellers - well, most of them - today breathed a sigh of relief after a storm that dumped 15 inches of snow and forced the closure of interstates across the Great Plains moved out of the region.

It allowed crews to clear drifts and stranded motorists to leave roadside hotels - but after causing at least two fatal car accidents and a plane crash that killed 11 people in total across the U.S.

Meanwhile hopes were dashed of a White Christmas in New York, Washington D.C. and Boston - as forecasters predict rain is more likely. But there's still a good chance of snow in the inner northeast.

White Christmas? You're most likely to get snow on Christmas Day if you live in one of the white shaded areas - and it's still possible if you're in one of the greyer areas

Lonely: A truck travels along Highway 40 as snow covers the highway and the surrounding plains, west of Hays, Kansas, on Tuesday

Way to go: Snow sticks to road signs along I-70 near Paxico, Kansas, on Tuesday. A deadly storm that halted travel throughout the Great Plains began to weaken on Tuesday

Stuck in: Debbie Weber digs out her driveway in Hays, Kansas, on Tuesday after a winter storm dumped more than 8 inches of snow on the area

The storm crawled from New Mexico and Colorado through Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. The fierce winds and heavy snowfall closed several major roads then weakened on Tuesday towards Missouri.

But another storm threatened some of those areas hit earlier in the week, including the Rockies and parts of Wyoming, New Mexico and western Kansas.

Those areas could see another round of snow and wind over the next few days – potentially bringing a white Christmas - but it won't be as heavy as the recent storm, the National Weather Service said.

‘It's tough to match what we had in some areas with this past storm,’ meteorologist Brian Barjenbruch of the National Weather Service in Topeka, Kansas, said early on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, authorities still reported snow drifts of up to 10ft in southeast Colorado, and Texas officials warned drivers to stay off the road in the Panhandle so crews could remove ice and snow.

Some highways in the western half of the Oklahoma Panhandle remained closed early on Wednesday, with transportation officials warning of hazardous conditions.

At least 40 people were stranded at the Longhorn Motel in Boise City, Oklahoma, where manager Pedro Segovia said blowing snow had created drifts 2ft and 3ft high and closed the main road.

‘Some people cannot even get out of their houses. There is too much snow,’ Mr Segovia said on  Tuesday. ‘It was blowing. We've got big piles. It's real bad.’

Receptionist MaKenzee Grove sympathised with the 50 or so people stranded at the hotel where she works in Guymon, about 60 miles east of Boise City.

‘I have this rinky-dink car that does not do well in this,’ she said. ‘If we wouldn't have had the wind, it wouldn't have been as bad. The winds... made the drifts really bad.’

A few guests traveling to Oklahoma City managed to leave on Tuesday, but others were staying another night until all the roads were clear, Ms Grove said.

Officials reopened Interstate 40 in the Texas Panhandle and New Mexico, and portions of Interstate 70 in western Kansas that had been closed on Tuesday.

Crawling: Inbound traffic on I-25 approaches Santa Fe, New Mexico, in a single file as snow accumulates on the road on Monday as a winter storm hit the area

New Mexico reopened a closed section of Interstate 25, the main route from Santa Fe to the Colorado line, after crews cleared drifts as high as 5ft.

In Kansas, schools in Manhattan 
cancelled classes on Tuesday, anticipating several inches of snow. But 
the National Weather Service reported later that 3 inches or less fell.

A cold rain pelted the Topeka area, turned into a mix of light sleet and snow without much settling and tapered off. The storm became less potent as it moved northeast toward the Great Lakes.

Kansas Highway Patrol Trooper Ben Gardner said the patrol dealt with dozens of accidents in which motorists slid off highways. ‘We had ice-covered roads, covered by snow packed on top,’ he said.

Wreckage: The crash site of a single-engine plane is seen on Monday in Brazos County, Texas. The crash killed five people, including two children. The flight originated in Atlanta and was headed for Waco, Texas

The late-autumn snowstorm lumbered into the region on Monday, turning roads to ice and reducing visibility to zero. Many of the areas hit had enjoyed a relatively balmy 60F just 24 hours earlier.

New York, Boston and Washington D.C. are all very unlikely to experience a White Christmas.

But a storm starting in British Columbia could bring snow to the northeast and New England.

Most others people outside of northern central parts of the U.S. won't have snow at Christmas.

The storm was blamed for at least eleven deaths. Four people were killed when their vehicle collided with a pickup truck in eastern New Mexico on Monday where blizzard-like conditions are rare.

A prison guard and inmate died when a jail van crashed along an icy Colorado roadway. The other five deaths came in central Texas after a light aircraft crash was blamed on the conditions.

Victims were Michael Butler, 33; his wife Kelly, 34; daughter Brooke, 14; and son Braden, 2. The pilot's brother, David Butler, 37, was also killed.
