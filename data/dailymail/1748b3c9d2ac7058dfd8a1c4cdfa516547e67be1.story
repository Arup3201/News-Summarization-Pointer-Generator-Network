This is the dramatic moment a burglar was caught on CCTV smashing his way into a TV antiques expert's shop before escaping with thousands of pounds worth of jewellery.

The footage, posted online by victim Alison Chapman – who regularly appears as a TV expert on shows such as Secret Dealers and David Dickinson's Real Deal – shows the offender forcing his way into her shop with a crowbar.

He can be seen breaking down the front door with the weapon before making his way into the 'Owlets' shop in Hythe, Kent, and smashing multiple glass cabinets.

The intruder can then clearly be seen scooping up gold and silver jewellery, watches and collectables before stuffing them into a bag he has brought with him.

Ms Chapman, 53, has now released the footage of the incident, which occurred in the early hours of Sunday morning, in an attempt to help catch the thief.

Writing on her Facebook page, she said: 'At around 2am some person/s have smashed through the front door of my lovely shop, smashed cabinets and grabbed what they could.

'He spent five minutes trying to get in to the shop "quietly" he triggered the tamper alarm, which goes to the police, then he went "potty" in his panic with his crowbar.

'I am sitting on a train willing it to go faster, trying to get back home to Kent. I'm grateful that it was at night and none of my staff or myself were involved.'

She added: 'We photograph every item of stock. By tomorrow I will easily identify each piece this man stole.

She said police managed to obtain some of the thief's DNA when they visited the shop to investigate the burglary.

She added: 'When he breathes and rests his face on the window pane, that was one place where they got his DNA.'

MS Chapman said it was 'ironic' the raid happened because she was away in Leeds for an auction with famous antique dealer Tim Hogwarth to raise money for kidney research.

A Kent Police spokesman said: 'We are investigating a burglary that took place at approximately 1am on Sunday 16 November at Owlets, in High Street, Hythe.

'A quantity of jewellery was stolen and damage was sustained to a door. Officers continue their enquiries.'
