Comic actor and impersonator Steve Bridges, who was best known for his impressions of President George W. Bush, has died aged 48.

The comedian, who also portrayed presidents Clinton and Obama with the help of prosthetics, was found dead at his Los Angeles home on Saturday.

It is believed Bridges died of natural causes. An autopsy is scheduled, but the Los Angeles County coroner's office said foul play was not suspected.

Loss: Comic and actor Steve Bridges, best known for his impersonations of President George W. Bush (as pictured), has been found dead in his LA home

Bridges, who was a regular on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, began doing impersonations as a child, starting with the Three Stooges.

'Anything I saw on TV, I imitated,' he told Larry King in a CNN interview in 2006.

He had voice coaching and acting classes growing up in Los Angeles, and caught the public's eye with his impressions of Al Gore and Clinton.

In 2003, he was invited to the White House to meet President Bush in the Oval Office.

Good humour: They also spoke together at a 2006 White House dinner

He attended without the prosthetic makeup, but Bush admitted he had seen videos - and was shocked by Bridges's uncanny performances.

According to Bridges, Bush said, 'I tell you: You see a videotape where someone looks like you, acts like you, talks like you - that's weird.'

Of the meeting, Bridges added: 'The President said he really appreciated the tone of my material, how it was all in fun and something heâ€™d feel comfortable having his daughters hear.'

In 2006, they spoke together at the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner - to uproarious laughter from audience.

Adopting the president's mannerisms, 
Bridges told the guests: 'Some of my critics in the international 
community call me arrogant.

'I will not even honour that with a response. Screw them!'

The president added that he was 'absolutely delighted to be here, as is [wife] Laura,' to which Mr Bridges quipped: 'She's hot!'

Bridges told the Washington Post in 2006: 'I try to become that person in a funny way. I try to act like him, from the mannerisms to the phraseology.'

He also underwent a process lasting more than two hours to have makeup and prosthetics applied to fully resemble the presidents.

Bridges built up a repertoire of around 200 impressions, including Homer Simpson, Regis Philbin and Rush Limbaugh. He also impersonated California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and President Jimmy Carter.

As himself: Bridges, 48, is believed to have died from natural causes

Bridges' management wrote on his site: 'It is with great sadness that we announce the death of Steve Bridges. His passing comes as a shock to all of us.

'The cause of death is not known at this time, but we will publish more information as it becomes available.

'Steve brought joy and laughter to 
millions and was a great inspiration to all who knew him. He will be 
sadly missed. Our prayers go to his family at this time.'

Bridges
 is survived by his parents, Tom and Margaret Bridges, two brothers, Jon
 and Philip, and a sister, Elizabeth Bridges, all of Clayton, 
California.
