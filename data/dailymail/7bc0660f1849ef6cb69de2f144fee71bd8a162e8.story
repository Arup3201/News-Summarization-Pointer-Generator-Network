It's one of the most prestigious events on the racing calendar so it's no surprise that visitors to Cheltenham Festival are as well-heeled as it gets.

Next week, crowds clad in fur and fancy hats will descend on the racecourse for four days of racing, champagne breakfasts and royal visitors.

Among them will be the Duchess of Cornwall who is due to present the trophy to the winner of the  Betway Queen Mother Champion Chase on Wednesday.

Prestigious: Cheltenham is one of the most prestigious events on the racing calendar and attracts royalty

Glamorous: Cheltenham is famous for its glamorously dressed racegoers - none with fake tan

Chic: Unlike at other races were glamour reigns supreme, ladies at Cheltenham dress for the weather

But Camilla isn't the only glamorous attendee expected at the racecourse next week, with Zara Tindall, Princess Anne and Autumn Phillips among the event's famous fans.

So who's who at Cheltenham? Femail reveals which royals and A-listers worth looking out for.

CAMILLA, DUCHESS OF CORNWALL

The Duchess has long been a fan of all things equestrian and is an annual visitor to Cheltenham racecourse.

Always impeccably, if cosily, dressed, last year saw her arrive on the arm of her food critic son, Tom Parker-Bowles.

Thumbs up: The Duchess of Cornwall is a keen racing fan and is a regular sight come race day

Presentation: Like last year, the Duchess will present one of the prizes on Ladies Day

Camilla, who is due to present a trophy on Ladies Day this year, spent most of the 2014 event ensconced in a box beside her son - and managed to bag a winner.

The patron of three equine charities, The British Equestrian Federation, The Brooke Hospital for Animals and Ebony Horse Club, the Duchess has been a rider all her life and used to hunt.

Now confined to watching thanks to a painful back, she is almost as enthusiastic about racing as the Queen and last month attended her first race meet of the year when she joined soldiers for the Royal Artillery Gold Cup at Sandown.

ZARA TINDALL

A professional rider in her own right, Zara Tindall, 33, is a familiar sight at the Cheltenham Festival, which she attends each year.

Runner: This year's Cheltenham Festival will see Zara Tindall's horse Monbeg Dude take to the course

Familiar face: Zara, pictured at last year's event, attended every day of last year's Cheltenham Festival

All smiles: Zara, although an eventer herself, is also a National Hunt racing trainer

Royal approval: Princess Anne, a keen racing fan, is a regular visitor to the Cheltenham Festival

Last year, she was there every single day, bringing husband Mike on day one and spending the rest of the week watching the races alongside her mother, Princess Anne.

Although a eventer by trade, Zara is also building up a reputation for training racehorses, most famously her husband's horse Monbeg Dude which competed in last year's Grand National.

The horse, which managed a respectable seventh place finish in the event, is also expected to make an appearance at Cheltenham this year, with Zara and Mike set to cheer him on from the sidelines. 

Zara is also training a horse owned by her mother, who, along with Autumn Phillips, is also expected to be on the guest list at this year's festival. 

PIPPA MIDDLETON

The Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister has become a regular visitor to UK sporting events, among them Wimbledon, Henley and, in 2013, Cheltenham.

Looking good: Pippa Middleton proved she knows her way around a dress code when she visited

Big day out: The Duchess of Cambridge's sister, who attended the 2013 event, failed to bag a winner

Sister act: The event also had a visit from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge the same year

Pictured enjoying the races in the company of Tom Kingston, Miss Middleton got the dress code, which encourages colour, spot on in her yellow coat.

She topped off the look with a cosy fur hat in a style similar to the one worn by the Duchess of Cornwall a year later.

CHANELLE MCCOY

The wife of top jockey AP McCoy, blonde Chanelle is a race day veteran and never puts a (well shod) foot wrong.

Friends: Chanelle at Cheltenham with, left, Zara Tindall, and right, Emma Spencer

A close friend of Zara Tindall, the women were pictured sharing a joke during last year's Cheltenham Festival and were seen together again at Royal Ascot the following June.

This year's event is set to be an emotional one for the 38-year-old, thanks to her husband's imminent retirement.

McCoy, whose career has spanned more than 20 years, has ridden more than 4,000 winners, including victories in the Grand National and the Cheltenham Gold Cup.

Although Chanelle has spoken of her fears for her husband's health in the past, she never fails to turn up to watch him race - always in a suitably glamorous ensemble.

Wondering who to have a flutter on? Ladbrokes' Jessica Bridge reveals which horses are set to be first past the post at Cheltenham Festival.

TUESDAY - CHAMPION HURDLE

HORSE: Faugheen

ODDS: 11/10 

He's called Faugheen the machine for a reason and it's hard to see his unbeaten record coming undone on Tuesday, despite the impressive field. 

Usual jockey, Ruby Walsh, is yet to decide his mount for the race, with stablemate and dual Champion Hurdle winner Hurricane Fly also lining up, but with fingers pointing towards Faugheen it's just another reason to back him.

WEDNESDAY - QUEEN MOTHER CHAMPION CHASE

HORSE: Dodging Bullets

ODDS: 4/1

Possible winner? AP McCoy, pictured at last year's event, will run his final Gold Cup race next week

All eyes might be on Sprinter Sacre and Sire de Grugy, but Dodging Bullets has easily had the most impressive route to this year's Festival, and although a short price the Clarence House Chase winner could and should serve up an upset to the front two in the betting.

THURSDAY: LADBROKES WORLD HURDLE

HORSE: Rock On Ruby

ODDS: 7/1

Old-time favourite Rock On Ruby could make history to become just the third Champion Hurdle winner to also land the World Hurdle trophy. 

He's been jumping and travelling well, and after comprehensively beating Vaniteux back in January he's stamped his position as a serious contender to the younger guard.

FRIDAY - GOLD CUP

HORSE: Carlingford Lough

ODDS: 10/1

It's impossible to not back AP McCoy's last ever ride in the Gold Cup - it would be a fairytale end to a glittering career for the 20-time champion jockey. 

There's still doubts whether favourite Silviniaco Conti can finally make it third time lucky at Cheltenham, but for the old romantics there's only one man that can win this year's Gold Cup, and it's AP McCoy.

CAMILLA BASSETT-SMITH

Famous for her flamboyant taste in hats, TV presenter Camilla is a regular visitor to Cheltenham and is based in nearby Gloucester.

Hat's a winner: TV presenter Camilla Bassett-Smith is famous for her fabulous hats

High-powered: Along with TV presenting, she is also a gold-medal winning gardener

Most of her work is for BBC Wiltshire, although she also boasts acting and modelling credits to her name.

She is also a gold-medal winning gardener, who has shown her work at Chelsea among others, and was part of the production team at Gardener's World.

To racing fans, however, she will always be the glamorous girl in the super-sized hats, with spectacular crimson, nude and chocolate numbers deployed in recent years.

LYSTRA ADAMS

She's not a celebrity and she's certainly not a royal but to racing fans, Lystra Adams, an equine enthusiast from Staffordshire, has become a familiar sight.

Bold choice: Lystra Adams at Cheltenham Festival in 2013, sporting an impressive crimson and black look

She's back! After wowing in crimson in 2013, Ms Adams returned wearing vibrant print the following year

That she has is largely due to her eccentric ensembles which are nearly always colourful and are, without fail, topped by a spectacular hat.

Although Royal Ascot and Glorious Goodwood are also on her racing season itinerary, her flair for colour is particularly noticeable during visits to Cheltenham.

Most impressive was her appearance on St Patrick's Thursday at last year's event, when she arrived clad head-to-toe in emerald green.

Top choice: On St Patrick's Thursday 2014, Ms Adams wore emerald, topped with a peacock feather hat

While Aintree is famous for its scantily clad racegoers and Royal Ascot for its hats, the Cheltenham Festival has become synonymous with an altogether more rural approach to dressing.

Eschewing skyscraper heels and flimsy dresses in favour of elegant wool coats and comfortable patent leather boots, the race meeting offers a masterclass in country chic, complete with lashings of tweed and even a flat cap or two.

Unlike Ascot, organisers at Cheltenham refuse to impose a dress code on guests and, beyond exhortations to wrap up warm and avoid anything that might offend, say anything goes - up to and including fancy dress.

But perhaps a warning isn't required: Although the clothes donned by Gloucestershire's most fashionable might be rural, the looks on show certainly don't lack glamour with oversized sunglasses, pearl necklaces and twinkling diamond stud earrings deployed to up the fashion ante.

Fur  is a recurring motif, as are hats that take inspiration from rural life. Like the stylish effort deployed by Zara Phillips on day one of the 2014 event, many come festooned in pheasant feathers while elegant blooms are a perennial favourite.

Male racegoers aren't immune from the pull of country style either, with most opting for tweed suits or chic red chinos teamed with a preppy navy blazer and artfully knotted tie.

But whether girls in pearls and princess coats or preppy chaps in Prince of Wales check, the Cheltenham Festival is just as stylish as its Berkshire counterpart.

But not everyone pulls it off...

Cheltenham Festival might have a fairly relaxed dress code  but most, with the March weather in mind, arrive sporting a take on practical glamour.

But not everyone gets it right, with everything from thigh-scraping skirts to bizarre hats spotted in the parade ring.

Should you need reminding, below are some of the worst offenders from last year. Remember ladies: just because it's tweed, doesn't mean it's classy. 

Oh dear: It might be tweed but in this case, the short-skirted look certainly isn't classy

Brrr! A patriotic Union Jack ensemble (left) and a shamrock embellished hat (right)

Tally ho! A hunting inspired ensemble from 2014, complete with a pheasant feather hat and a pair of gauntlets

Short and sweet: Two 2014 racegoers chose to brave the chill in short skirts more suitable for summer
