Former Page 3 girl Jilly Johnson described Max Clifford as a ‘gentleman’ yesterday as she defended his reputation.

She told the publicist’s sex assault trial that he was a ‘very honourable man’ who had never behaved inappropriately.

Clifford winked at the ex-glamour model from the dock as she tottered past on high heels after finishing her evidence.

Jilly Johnson, 60, said Max Clifford, 70, was a 'perfect gentleman' who helped her with her career in the 1970s

The 70-year-old PR mogul is standing trial accused of 11 counts of indecent assault – all of which he denies.

He allegedly groped, molested and abused a succession of girls as young as 12 between 1966 and 1984.

His accusers have claimed he wandered around his office naked and made them perform sex acts on him.

But
 yesterday, a woman famous for taking off her clothes told Southwark 
Crown Court in London that Clifford had always behaved impeccably.

The jury had been promised Clifford’s ‘celebrity’ friends had not abandoned him, and blonde Miss Johnson was duly sworn in.

She met Clifford when she was 17 and in 1975 she became the first woman to appear topless in the Daily Mirror.

She
 said she had dressed as ‘provocatively as you could imagine, in mini 
dresses and boots’ when she knew the celebrity fixer in the 1970s.

Now a 60-year-old grandmother, Miss Johnson wore an above-the-knee skirt and a smart jacket as she sat at the witness stand.

Asked
 to explain how Clifford behaved around her, Miss Johnson, a 
twice-married mother-of-one, said: ‘Respectfully, nothing untoward or 
inappropriate.

‘Literally as
 a mentor, as a guide and as a great help. Yes, he was marvellous.’ She 
told the jury of six men and five women: ‘I think he is a very 
honourable man. I don’t see that he could be – in any way, shape or form
 – not that. He is very much a gentleman.’

The
 former model, who was also a member of girl band Blonde on Blonde, said
 Clifford had been crucial in helping her make the transition to 
actress. She subsequently appeared on popular television programmes 
including The Jim Davidson Show and The Des O’Connor Show.

Next
 up in the witness box was a former secretary of Clifford, who attacked 
suggestions that he regarded his offices as his ‘sexual fiefdom’.

The
 ex-model, who cannot be named, told jurors it was ‘absolute nonsense’ 
to suggest the offices in New Bond Street, central London, were 
‘sexually charged’.

She said: ‘The atmosphere was great. A lot of laughs. Max was a practical joker.’

The
 witness said that she  never saw him walk around  naked. She could not 
recall a woman she knew telling her  that Clifford had exposed himself 
to her in his offices.

‘If a
 friend had said she had been assaulted, I think that is something that 
would have stuck in my mind,’ she said. ‘The Max Clifford I knew would 
never assault someone.’

Clifford, who listened from the dock with a hearing aid loop, smiled as the women gave their evidence

A 
former teenage babysitter for Clifford’s daughter Louise told jurors 
that he was ‘always very respectable’. Diedra Taylor said she came 
forward to be a character witness after the publicist was arrested.

Tina
 Tolfrey, a mother who knew Clifford through his work as a patron of 
Chase Children’s Hospice, said he was a ‘hero’ to young people who made 
children’s ‘dreams come true’ by taking them on trips to Disney parks 
and football matches.

‘The kids would look at him as an uncle figure,’ she said. ‘He’s the gentlest, kindest person.’

Clifford, wearing a bright blue blazer, white shirt and black trousers, smiled warmly at the women as they gave evidence.

Earlier
 in the trial, Clifford admitted he was a womaniser who cheated on his 
first wife with four extra-marital affairs, including with a TV dancer 
and a French model.

He told 
how the 1960s and 70s were a time of ‘sexual revolution’ and how he 
attended sex parties with Hollywood sex siren Diana Dors.

But
 he described all his affairs as ‘meaningful relationships’ and insisted
 he had never had any need to force himself on a woman. The trial 
continues on Monday.
