Cascading down a nearly 200 metre drop in Yosemite National Park, Bridalveil Fall is a breathtaking scene.

But occasionally, when conditions permit, the magnificent waterfall is transformed into and even more spectacular sight. With just the right mix of water vapour and light, it becomes an ethereal rainbow haze that permeates the lush vegetation and dramatic rock faces around it.

This spectacular phenomenon only last a few minutes, as the falling sunlight passes across the mountainous backdrop and catches the vaporised water.

Stunning rare moment: This spectacular shot was captured as the late afternoon autumn light caught the mist from Bridalveil Fall, in Yosemite National Park, California. This picture is just one section of the full-frame picture snapped by photographer Mei Xu

But for patient photographer Mei Xu, it was certainly worth the wait.

The fall, which stands at 189 metres, is famous for the mist that wafts off it when the breezes blow and which is said to resemble, as its name dictates, a bride's flowing veil.

Native Americans named the fall Pohono, meaning 'spirit of the puffing wind'. Guarding the entrance to the valley, the Ahwahneechee tribe believed the fall was home to a vengeful spirit, and those leaving the valley would be cursed if they looked at it.

But also, they said inhaling the mist from the fall would bring good luck to anyone looking to marry.

It's clear to see from Ms Xu's incredible picture why native Americans believed there was more to the fall than meets the eye.

At times, when the wind is strong, the water appears to fall sideways, and during lesser water flows, the narrow spurt completely vaporises before it reaches the bottom.

There are a number of vantage and viewpoints set up around the park for onlookers to watch the incredible spectacle. But only few lucky - and patient - observers will witness quite such a breathtaking scene as this.

The magnificent natural phenomena was also captured last year by photographer Justin Lee, who was overjoyed to find himself in exactly the right place at the right time.

Mr Lee, from British Columbia, Canada,
 was standing close to a cliff at the Tunnel View lookout when he 
spotted the colourful scene.

He said at the time: 'The sun has to be in 
position to get the rainbow, and this photo was not planned by me 
beforehand. I just happened to be in the right place at the right time.

'I couldn't believe how lucky I was to see such a sight, and just had to start taking pictures straight away.'

Mr Lee took hundreds of photos of the magical event. He said: 'I was there for about 30 minutes, snapping probably a couple of hundred photos at this particular location.

The ideal conditions for a rainbow are the combination of sunlight and water droplets.

This usually comes in the form of rain, but fine spray from a waterfall is often just as effective.
