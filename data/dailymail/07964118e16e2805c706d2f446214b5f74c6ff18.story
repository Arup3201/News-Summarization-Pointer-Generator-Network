There is a football stadium in the tiny Tunisian settlement Hammamet, hometown of Lazhar Khedira, where the grass is long and dry and the nets have holes in them.

The goalposts are square, not round, dating them to before 1987 when they were banned by FIFA.

There are three white walls surrounding three of the sides and a wire mesh fence behind one of the goals. Tall trees grow at one end and the hum of a busy main road nearby can be heard.

'This is the stadium where Sami Khedira got famous,' one local recalls.

Between the age of 10 and 15, this is where World Cup winner Khedira, born in Stuttgart to a Tunisian father and German mother, Doris, would often come to play when he visited.

Although he has always represented the German national side, from under 17s through to winning 51 caps for the seniors, Tunisia is a large part of his life.

Khedira explains: 'Although Hammamet is not my home, it is the hometown of my father so it is also important for me.

'My entire family lives there. My grandma and my grandpa live there as well as seven aunts and one uncle. I don't even know how many cousins I have there.

'Hammamet for me is a beautiful place for vacation. I really love to go there and visit my family. I like to relax on the beaches and to get away from my daily routine. It is the perfect place for a retreat, where I can feel at home.'

Khedira would also hone his football skills on the beaches when he would go on holiday there as a teenager. He joined Stuttgart's youth team in 1995, aged just eight, so by the time he was visiting his father's family at 15 he was already a star in Hammamet. It did not stop him returning to play with his peers on that pitch with overgrown bushes peering over the walls.

'It was a great honour for our guys to learn from him,' the same local recounts. 'He is very friendly and generous, that's why people like him. In particular they love his kindness.'

Khedira was a local hero, but back in Germany he was fast becoming a star, too.

At Stuttgart he won the Bundesliga title in 2007 then captained the Germany Under 21 side which won the 2009 European Championship, beating England 4-0 in the final.

It was a team which included Manuel Neuer, Benedikt Howedes, Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels and Mesut Ozil, who would all also go on to win the World Cup in 2014.

Swoop: Arsenal have already signed Alexis Sanchez for £30million and are considering Khedira for £20m

A year later he earned a move to Real Madrid where he has since won a La Liga title, two Spanish Cups and the Champions League.

After
 winning the World Cup, Khedira's stock is at an all-time high and his 
refusal to sign a new deal at Real, with only a year left to run on his 
contract, has meant they are willing to cash in. Arsenal see him as the ideal man to plug the gap in their midfield.

Arsene Wenger's side is crammed with attack-minded midfielders and forwards – Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ozil, Rosicky, Alexis Sanchez, Santi Cazorla, Jack Wilshere, Mikel Arteta – but lack a defensive midfield linchpin. Mathieu Flamini did a job there last season but he is not world class.

If an agreement can be met, that humble man who grew up playing on a tatty, battered pitch in Hammamet might well be the perfect fit.
