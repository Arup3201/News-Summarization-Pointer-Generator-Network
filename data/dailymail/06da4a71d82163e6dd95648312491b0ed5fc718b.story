A mother and daughter died in a blaze started by a banned black market cigarette, an inquest heard.

Firefighters issued a warning after the death of Caroline Kaur and daughter Hayleigh at their home in Plumstead, south-east London.

An Indian-made packet of cigarettes was found at the scene and is believed to have been the cause of the fire.

The cigarettes did not have a UK-standard safety feature to stop it burning for long periods.

Caroline Kaur, believed to be in her 50s, and her 23-year-old daughter Hayleigh were the victims of a blaze which destroyed their family home in the early hours of June 18.

Residents described hearing shouts and 'blasts like fireworks' at 1am from the fire which left the house gutted and half the roof destroyed.

The inquest also found a smoke alarm probably saved the lives of other people living in the property.

Three more women, two men and a dog managed to escape the blaze which saw 35 firefighters tackle the inferno for more than two hours.

Rajinder Singh who lost a wife and daughter in the house fire was keen to promote the importance of a working smoke alarm in every home.

He said: 'It is essential everyone tests their smoke alarms and makes sure you replace the batteries immediately if they don't work.

'My wife had replaced the batteries in our smoke alarms just days before the fire and if we hadn't done that it is likely the whole family would have died.'

'It's vital that you know what to do if there is a fire in your home, have a clear escape plan and keep door and window keys where everyone you live with can find them.'

Meanwhile, neighbour Dorothy McCole, who lives opposite, paid tribute to the mother-of-five.

Mrs McCole who worked with the victim at nearby Gallions Mount Primary School, said: 'Caroline was the matriarch in that family - she led the family.

'She was a lovely, lovely person and a leader. All I could see was this house in flames, absolutely massive flames.

'If you can imagine an open fire in a grate - that is what it was like. It was so fierce.'

The brigade has urged all smokers to buy cigarettes that meet European Union safety standards and never to throw cigarettes or hot ash into rubbish bins.

The coroner concluded that both deaths were accidental.
