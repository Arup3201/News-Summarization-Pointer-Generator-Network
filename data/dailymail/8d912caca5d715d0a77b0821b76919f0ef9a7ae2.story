It must be every car fans dream but they might not get much sleep with the engine noise in this superpowered 600bhp bunkbed.

The unusual vehicle, which goes under the hammer next month, boasts a V8 engine, automatic transmission, disc brakes and super-wide Goodyear tyres.

It can in theory be driven in comfort from either the top or bottom bunk.

Auctioneers Historics at Brooklands, Surrey, expect offers in the region of £12,000 to £15,000 for the custom car.

Also on the list for the February 18 auction at Mercedes-Benz World is the iconic ‘Bugaloos Buggy’ made famous by the children's television show in the 1970s.

Broadcaster NBC commissioned George Barris to make the Bugaloo who made the original Batmobile and later versions of the KITT car in Knight Rider.

Using a four-passenger fibreglass body mounted on a Volkswagen floorplan, the car was built to look like a bug - reflecting the programme’s characters who could fly and walk on water - with wings set on a T-shaped roll bar and oversized headlights designed to look like eyes.

The car is fully street legal and also has a guide price of £12,000 to £15,000.

Also going under the hammer is a 23-foot long multi-engined Snake Pit car which is fitted with six synchronised Ford Cobra V8 engines.
