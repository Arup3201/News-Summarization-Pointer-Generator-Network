Together in 2001: If Prince Andrew (left) sets foot in the US, attorneys acting for Virginia Roberts (right) could attempt to hand him deposition papers

Prince Andrew is now unable to visit the United States without running the risk of being ambushed with a subpoena, a lawyer warned yesterday.

If he sets foot there, attorneys acting for Virginia Roberts could attempt to hand him deposition papers, he said. These would oblige him to give evidence on oath – or face the threat of jail.

The legal team representing Miss Roberts has already tried to ambush several people they wish to question with legal papers, including Andrew’s friend Ghislaine Maxwell. 

If they succeeded in passing deposition papers to Andrew, in theory he would be obliged to attend court.

The unwelcome prospect is enough to make royal courtiers think carefully before planning any visits to the US, where Andrew has been many times both in an official capacity and on holiday. 

It is also unknown if he is covered by legal immunity – either as a royal or because he was a Whitehall-backed business envoy – because this has never been tested in international law.

Yesterday leading New York lawyer Dan Bright said Miss Roberts’s attorneys could try to serve papers on Andrew at an airport when he arrived – which could create an embarrassing scene, not least because of his royal protection officers – or could wait until he was at a place, such as a restaurant, where it would be awkward for him to ‘run away’.

Lawyers, or their representatives, have even pretended to be butlers at charity galas to hand papers to a target, he added.

If the prince was handed deposition papers and then refused to attend, he could be held in contempt of court.

‘If he doesn’t show up, lawyers can ask a judge to start a contempt hearing so that if he came back into the country, he could be arrested and put in jail,’ Mr Bright said. 

‘It could be problematic for him if he wants to return to America.’

Andrew’s lawyers would probably try to quash a subpoena, but there was no guarantee of success. 

He said: ‘If the judge really believes that he has vital evidence, then he might not throw it out. 

'In that case, Andrew’s lawyers will probably come to an arrangement under which he will give a deposition but at a time of their choosing. They will also probably ask that it not be made public or leaked.’

Another option to get Andrew to give evidence would be via a British judge. However, such things are hard to enforce, he said.

Harvard law professor: Alan Dershowitz (pictured)

A Harvard law professor accused along with Prince Andrew of abusing Virginia Roberts said yesterday that she had ‘made the whole thing up’ and accused her lawyers of putting ‘real’ rape victims ‘in a terrible position’ with her claims.

On US television, Alan Dershowitz denied ever seeing anything improper or even being around under-age women in the presence of Jeffrey Epstein. 

Miss Roberts alleges Mr Dershowitz came into a room to ‘chat’ with Epstein while she performed a sex act on him.

But the professor said: ‘I’ve never seen her and I’ve never met her. She is categorically lying.’ 

Later on ITV News, he said that, by Miss Roberts’ own account, she was not underage when she met Andrew. 

He added: ‘She claims she got paid for it. She’s admitting that she’s been a prostitute.’
