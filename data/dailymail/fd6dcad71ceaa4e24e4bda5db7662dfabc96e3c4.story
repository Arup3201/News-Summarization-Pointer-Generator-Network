The 16-year-old boy that bypassed security and managed to climb to the top of 1 World Trade Center is now saying he's sorry for the stunt that made national headlines.

'I seriously apologize to anyone who may have been insulted or felt disrespected by my actions,' Justin Casquejo said on his Twitter page Friday afternoon. 'It was not my intention to do so.'

New York Police Department Chief Bill Bratton today also told reporters he was 'disappointed' by the breach.

'We’ll work very closely with the Port Authority to determine exactly what happened,' the New York Post quoted him as saying. 'I’m disappointed that it happened, certainly. We have a lot of focus on that area, but again, the focus will significantly increase as it gets closer to opening.'

Fascinated: Casquejo has long been obsessed with the WTC's Freedom Tower, according to the Post

Casquejo, of nearby Weehawken, New 
Jersey, was arrested at 6 a.m. Sunday and charged with misdemeanor 
criminal trespass, said Joe Pentangelo, a spokesman for the Port 
Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site.

The
 teen accessed the construction site of the nearly completed tower by 
slipping through a 1-foot opening in a fence at around 4.00 a.m., 
Pentangelo said. He then allegedly entered the tower by climbing 
scaffolding.

'He’s a skinny kid who got through a skinny hole,' a police source told the New York Post.

Casquejo is said to have taken an elevator up to the 88th floor despite not having any identification, according to the paper.

He was let off at the 88th floor and hoofed it up to the 104th floor where he sneaked past a sleeping guard to access the roof.

That guard has since been fired, the spokesman said, but the elevator operator was ab;e to keep his job because he is in a union.

Casquejo scaled equipment on the roof to reach the 1,776-foot tall Freedom Tower's antenna.

The daredevil spent two hours perched atop the city before trying to sneak his way out as the sun came up.

'He came here and he ran hog wild,' a site worker told the Post.

Boisterous: Casquejo was much more talkative on Twitter than when reached by the Post

Port Authority police arrested him on the premises. His camera and cellphone were seized after authorities obtained a search warrant.

Officials are still trying to piece together exactly how he was able to elude security measures implemented by agencies including the New York Police Department, Port Authority Police and private security firms.

'I walked around the construction site and figured out how to access the Freedom Tower rooftop,' Casquejo said in court, according to documents cited by the paper.

The investigation was continuing into whether the teen may have entered other parts of the building.

He later tweeted the word 'inspired,' in reference to his now-infamous climb to the top of one of the tallest buildings in the world.

He wasn't nearly as talkative when reached by the post.

'Ha ha, oh yeah, that. Right. I would really love to talk to you guys because I have a lot that I want to say about it,' said the teen. 'I was told that I just can’t [talk] without permission.'

'We take security and these types of infractions very seriously and will prosecute violators,' Joe Dunne, chief security officer for the Port Authority, said in a statement. 'We continue to reassess our security posture at the site and are constantly working to make this site as secure as possible.'
