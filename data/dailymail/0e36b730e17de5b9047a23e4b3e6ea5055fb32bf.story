They took to the streets in their thousands with the intention of voicing their anger to the Coalition in the bitter row over pensions.

But it seems that although many stuck to their task of manning the picket lines in protest, others decided to use their day off for an altogether more leisurely pursuit.

With schools closed due to strike action, many parents and children with a rare weekday off seized the opportunity for an extra day's Christmas shopping.

Many shopping centres which would normally have been only moderately busy were instead crammed with shoppers who had a rare break from work or school.

One centre chief declared: ‘Christmas is well and truly underway at last’, as bargain hunters packed into store aisles.

Bluewater shopping centre in Kent reported a seven per cent increase in footfall, which bosses directly attributed to the national strikes.

Tim Hollands, Assistant General Manager at the centre, said: 'I have no idea why we’ve been so busy but I would suggest that some of the shoppers today were public sector workers and parents with children who aren’t at school.

In Scotland, Glasgow's Silverburn shopping centre reported 15,000 extra visitors than on a normal weekday

'In particular, there are a lot of families at Bluewater today, due to some schools being closed and many parents being off work.'

At the Trafford Centre, Manchester, Gordon McKinnon, Director of Operations, said: 'Christmas is well and truly underway at The Trafford Centre today, as people take advantage of a midweek day off.

'Manchester has experienced a huge jump in footfall, compared to the same day last year.'

Packed: Silverburn in Glasgow was just one of several major shopping centres to report 'significant' increases in visitor numbers

The trend of increased shopping traffic continued elsewhere nationwide, with the Metrocentre in Newcastle also reporting swollen numbers.

Tim Lamb, general manager of Newcastle’s Metrocentre said: ‘It has been a very, very busy day today.’

A spokesman for Brent Cross Shopping Centre, north-west London, said: 'We’ve had a lot of families and parents who have had to look after their kids because of the strike it’s been a great day.

'It’s felt a bit like a busy weekend not a week day.'

North of the border, meanwhile, Silverburn Shopping Centre in Glasgow said it expected up to 15,000 more customers than on a normal weekday, according to the BBC.

The 24-hour walkout by two million workers is being staged amid union fury over plans to reform pensions which will involve members working longer and having to pay more.

It is the biggest strike for over 30 years, with schools, hospitals, courts, transport and government all set to be hit by the walkout.

But Mr Cameron told the House of Commons: ‘So far the evidence would suggest that 40 per cent of schools are open.’

He also said the country had full ambulance service cover and that just 18 out of 900 job centres were closed.

Millions of children stayed at home today as teachers and heads took to the picket lines, affecting almost three in four schools.

The Department for Education (DfE) said it believed that more than half of England's 21,700 state schools - 58 per cent - are closed, with a further 13 per cent partially shut. About 13 per cent are open, the DfE said, while the rest are unknown.

Although Heathrow was today braced for major disruption, some passengers claimed border controls were 'better than usual'

The airport yesterday warned of arrivals expecting a two or three hour wait at passport control, due in part to workers staffing the borders having limited training.

Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said a 'significant' number of civil servants had volunteered to cover for striking Border Agency staff, including a 'considerable' number from the Ministry of Defence.

Even Gabby Bertin, Mr Cameron's long-serving spokeswoman, stood in for UK Border Agency staff at Heathrow today.

Mr Maude, who is the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'There are going to be queues but we have proper contingency plans in place and we have been training people to do what we can to mitigate the impact.'
