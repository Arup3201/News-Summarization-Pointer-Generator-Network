Glenys Stacey, Chief Executive of Ofqual, said there are different views on whether the AS-Level qualification should be kept

Sweeping reforms to school exams could lead to elite A-levels with a tougher grading scale so universities can identify the brightest pupils.

The new-style tests would be given a different set of grades to enable tutors and employers to tell them apart from existing exams.

The reforms would effectively create a two-tier system; old-style A-levels and new versions with beefed-up content, a greater emphasis on essay-writing and a strict limit on exam resits.

The move comes after the headmaster of a leading public school criticised current tests  as ‘mindless “satnav” A-levels’ that did little to inspire pupils and teachers.

The new A-levels would be phased in subject by subject over four years, with traditional disciplines likely to be prioritised. By 2018, all old-style  A-levels would be scrapped.

One of the biggest changes in the proposals, unveiled by exams watchdog Ofqual yesterday, is  an overhaul of the current six-point A* to E grading scale. Gradual grade inflation has led some universities to complain they struggle to identify the brightest applicants from an increasingly well-qualified field.

Alternative grading systems could involve a mixture of  both marks and grades, with students given percentages alongside an overall grade.

However, Ofqual admitted its shake-up would need to ensure there was no discrimination against candidates who had completed their A-levels under the old system.

Ofqual said: ‘This consultation provides an opportunity to revisit the grading structure of A-levels. It may be that there  are better ways to support university selection and secure appropriate differentiation.’

A spokesman for the watchdog added: ‘We are asking whether there are enough points on the grading scale to offer appropriate differentiation.

‘With some subjects being reformed before others, we are asking whether there should be a way to differentiate between new A-levels and those done  the old way. Would it be right to expect employers to check which year exams were taken? Should this be clear from the way that the exams are recorded?’

AS-Levels could be scrapped under plans to reform exams

He added that the proposals aimed to ‘increase the currency’ of A-levels and improve them ‘so they are fit for purpose and held in high public regard’.

Other reforms under consideration include strict rules on the number and mix of essays, multiple-choice questions and  in-depth research A-levels should contain in order to stop teachers ‘playing the system’ by choosing easy exams.

Universities – instead of civil servants – would decide the  content of syllabuses and at least 20 would need to endorse each new qualification before it can be ‘signed off’.

The future of AS-levels – which are taken after a year of sixth-form studies and contribute 50 per cent to the overall A-level grade – is also in doubt.

If A-levels are retained, the opportunities for resitting exams at a later date to inflate final grades would be slashed.

January exam sittings would be axed and teenagers would be given just one chance to retake, the following summer.

Ofqual warned that ‘students do not always treat exams  seriously if they know they have the opportunity to resit’.

Dr Anthony Seldon, master of Wellington College in Berkshire, said: ‘The proposals are a step in the right direction, in that it would be a move away from the mindless “satnav” A-level towards a real test of students’ abilities and the exams would be more likely to inspire challenging and thoughtful teaching.’

However, unions warned against rushing the reforms.

Russell Hobby, of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘It needs to be said that the volume of change in schools at the moment is overwhelming.

‘There is a serious risk that avoidable mistakes will slip in and valuable reforms will be implemented badly in the rush and turbulence.’
