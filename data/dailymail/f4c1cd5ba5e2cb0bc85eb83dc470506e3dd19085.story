Lawyers last night joined calls for the taxman not to be allowed to seize money directly from bank accounts.

Building societies, accountants and small firms have already questioned whether HM Revenue and Customs can be trusted with the powers when it has a record of making mistakes.

The Law Society went further by branding the debt recovery proposals as ‘draconian and regressive’.

Lawyers have joined calls to stop taxman raiding our bank accounts and firms have questioned whether HM Revenue and Customs can be trusted with the powers when it already has a record of making mistakes

Spokesman Gary Richards said lawyers feared HMRC ‘has a tendency to press on even when it has not demonstrated any need for additional powers’.

He added: ‘We agree that tax that is due must be paid, but HMRC’s existing powers – if properly used – are sufficient. There are already streamlined procedures for recovery of tax due in UK courts.

‘We are concerned that the direct recovery of debt from bank accounts without judicial supervision may not comply with data protection or human rights legislation.’

Outlined in George Osborne’s Budget, the plans would allow the taxman to take cash directly from a current account, joint account or Isa, without going through the courts. Around 17,000 people a year could have money seized.

The scheme has been subject to a consultation that opponents said appeared to have been little more than a formality.

Chas Roy-Chowdhury, of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, said the number of groups that had expressed concern should be a wake-up call for the Treasury. He added: ‘The Government must take all the objections on board rather than pushing forward with this and acting like a bull in a china shop.

‘They need to rethink the whole proposal, which we think is defective. The impression we are getting is that they will go ahead with this whatever people say, and probably before the next election.’

The Building Societies Association issued a stark warning about the proposals on Monday, saying savers might go back to storing cash under the mattress if they fear their money is not safe in the bank.

It said HMRC’s record of blunders meant it could not be trusted to be ‘judge, jury and executioner’.

A wide range of organisations have questioned the plans, including the Federation of Small Businesses, civil liberties charity Liberty, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and the British Bankers Association.

HMRC will target only those who owe at least £1,000 and who would have at least £5,000 left in their bank account after the debt is taken. Tax officials should also have contacted them at least four times.

The Money Advice Trust, a debt charity, claimed the safeguards were insufficient.

But an HMRC spokesman said: ‘The Direct Recovery of Debt proposals contain numerous safeguards’, and ‘will level the playing field firmly but fairly’.
