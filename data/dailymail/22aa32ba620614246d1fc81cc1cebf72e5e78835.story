British downhill champion Gee Atherton is more used to racing rivals on two wheels not with two wings.

But the 2012 world championship silver medallist put his reputation on the line when he headed to the mountains of north Wales to race against a peregrine falcon, the fastest bird in the world.

Atherton won his first Downhill World Cup in 2004 aged just 19 and has finished in the top five of the Downhill World Series every year since.

The 28-year-old has been Downhill World Champion, Down Hill World Cup Series Champion, Downhill European Champion and twice British National Downhill Champion.

The video, filmed in association with Red Bull and BBC Earth Unplugged, needed nine cameras to document the unique sequence, including a ‘bird cam’ and a special Skybot Helicam.

Atherton said of the experience: 'It 
was really hard to concentrate knowing the Falcon’s razor sharp talons 
were just centimetres from my head.

'I had the advantage of numerous jumps, drops and turns throughout the course.

'However the Falcon’s agility was hard to beat.'
