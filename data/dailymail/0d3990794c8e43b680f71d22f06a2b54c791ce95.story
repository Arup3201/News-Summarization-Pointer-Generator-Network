Marriage: Rolf Harris and his wife Alwen, who says her husband of 55 years has been painting every day since his arrest

Artist and entertainer Rolf Harris has been painting 'every day' to deal with the trauma of being accused of sexual offences, his wife has said..

Harris, 83, was arrested last month by police investigating allegations of sexual abuse following the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Harris's wife of 55 years, Alwen Hughes, says 'we're still laughing' despite the stress of the Scotland Yard investigation.

The Welsh sculptress
and jeweller met her future husband while they were both art students, 
marrying in March 1958. They have one daughter, Bindi, an artist.

Veteran TV star Harris was originally interviewed by detectives from Scotland Yard's Operation Yewtree in November.

Today Ms Hughes said the allegations had stunned his family and added that they are standing by him as they fight for his name to be cleared.

She said her husband had been painting 'every day' to cope with the devastation of his arrest, and said he had vowed to continue to entertain his fans, despite the allegations.

'We're fine. Yes, it's been quite hard but it's all right, we're still laughing. I hope it will be okay,' she told the Daily Mirror.

Since Harris's arrest vandals have defaced pieces of his art.

Officers were called after paint was splashed across the outside of the Triton Gallery in Torquay, Devon.

Staff say they first received angry threats from a member of the public who insisted they take the artwork down.

Harris, who has denied any wrongdoing, is one of 12 people arrested under Operation Yewtree, the national investigation prompted by allegations against Savile.

He was interviewed under caution on November 29, five days after a search warrant was executed at his home. Following his arrest he was bailed to a date in May.

The Australian-born entertainer was made a CBE in the 2006 Queen's Birthday Honours and was also appointed Officer of the Order of Australia in the honours list last year.

He was recognised for his service to performing and visual arts, to charitable organisations and to international relations through the promotion of Australian culture.

At
last summer’s Diamond Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace, Harris 
famously led the crowd – including Princess Anne – in an impromptu 
rendition of Two Little Boys, his 1969 Christmas No 1 hit.

He is also famed for his 1957 song Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport.

Prior to the announcement of his arrest, Harris had been the only celebrity Yewtree suspect not to have been identified by the mainstream media.

His
detention follows the arrests of pop star Gary Glitter, comedian 
Freddie Starr, DJ Dave Lee Travis, publicist Max Clifford and comedian 
Jim Davidson. Starr, Travis, Clifford and Davidson have all publicly 
denied any wrong-doing and gave statements after their arrests.
