Guests at the wedding of Prince William's friend Thomas van Straubenzee and society bride Lady Melissa Percy were delighted when an RAF helicopter performed a fly-past above the castle reception.

An RAF Sea King returning from a rescue in the Lake District flew low over the Alnwick Castle, in Northumberland, as crew waved at guests, including the prince who is an RAF search and rescue pilot himself.

Earlier the crew had flown a walker to hospital in Carlisle after he broke his collarbone in a 330ft fall near Helvellyn mountain. They paid a visit to the castle as they returned to the nearby RAF Boulmer base.

William was joined by his brother Harry, who is also a close friend of Mr van Straubenzee, but his heavily-pregnant wife the Duchess of Cambridge decided to stay at home.

the town.

Dressed in pale 
espresso floor-length gowns and clutching bouquets, the bridesmaids 
helped the excited-looking bride with her full dress, which was whipped 
up by the north east winds.

Pippa Middleton, resplendent in a 
patterned peplum dress with co-ordinating hat and heels, was greeted at 
the church gates by cries of 'beautiful' from the crowd.

Princesses
Beatrice and Eugenie are also among the Royal contingent at today's 
ceremony. The sisters - Beatrice wearing blue and Eugenie in green - 
were spotted hugging other guests at the gate before walking into the 
picturesque church.

Society
girl Cressida chose a blue and white maxi dress, which she teamed with a
blue sequinned jacket and a cream flower in her hair.

unknown

Royal approval: Prince William and his brother's ex-girlfriend, graduate Chelsy Davy, gathered together to applaud the newly weds

The Duke of Cambridge was without his 
heavily pregnant wife Kate, but there were still plenty of glamorous 
female guests in attendance - including her sister Pippa Middleton, 
Prince Harry's girlfriend Cressida Bonas, Princesses Beatrice and 
Eugenie, and Holly Branson.

The Duchess of Northumberland, 
mother-of-the-bride, told The Journal newspaper ahead of the 
ceremony: 'We are really excited.

'The
weather forecast is not great but Melissa and Thomas do not seem to 
mind. Whatever the weather it is going to be a wonderful day.'

Lady
Melissa is a 26-year-old tennis coach while the groom is a 
chartered-surveyor and long-time friend of both William and Harry.

What an entrance! Lady Melissa Percy was seen 
seen arriving in an ornate horse drawn carriage for her wedding to 
Thomas Van Straubenzee

The brothers were at the 30-year-old's London stag do earlier this month.

Mr
van Straubenzee travelled to New Zealand with William on a gap year and
was reportedly on the phone to Harry when he was mugged in London last 
year. It was said that Harry alerted police and went out to find his 
friend after the ordeal.

Lady Melissa is the Duke of Northumberland's second daughter. She left Alnwick Castle for the church in a restored horse-drawn carriage 
that is almost 200 years old.

When her sister Lady Katie, a 
motorbike mechanic, married at St Michael's Church two years ago, Pippa 
Middleton was a guest. She is friends with Earl George Percy, the Duke's
elder son.

Adorable: The couple appeared to have chosen a

The bride wore a Bruce Oldfield dress with flowers by local florist Caro Dickinson, who has also decorated the church and castle.

After the 5pm service, a reception was held in the castle's State Rooms, followed by dinner in a marquee. There were fireworks in the evening, which the public watched from the pastures below the castle.

Soon
after the wedding, Lady Melissa's dress will be displayed alongside her
sister Katie's wedding dress in The Coach House at Alnwick Castle.

Uniformed police and plain clothes officers kept a close eye on the hundreds gathered to watch the procession.

Block heeled shoes, ankle-length dresses and smaller hats were very much in fashion amongst the guests.

The
couple appeared to have chosen a woodland theme for their nuptials, as 
their pages and young bridesmaids were dressed as Robin Hoods and 
fairies in green.

Chelsy
Davy, an official attendant to the bride, wore a pale espresso-coloured
dress, and looked delighted to help her friend with the gown and its 
long train.

Despite the Summer date for the wedding, strong winds whipped the light fabric up, making the full gown billow in the breeze. Designer Bruce Oldfield was on hand to make sure it looked perfect.
