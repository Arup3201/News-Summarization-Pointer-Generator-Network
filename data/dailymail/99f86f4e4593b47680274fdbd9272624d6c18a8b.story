A straight A student was kicked out of classes after she dyed her hair green to look like singer Avril Lavigne. 

Ellie Douglas is facing weeks of being taught in isolation at Halewood Academy in Liverpool.

The 15-year-old had her hair coloured over the Christmas break in tribute to her pop idol.

But on the first day back at school, she was taken aside and told she had 24 hours to remove the dye and restore her natural hair colour or she would be put in isolation.

She spent three days in an isolation cubicle and was escorted to lessons by a teacher before her father Mark removed her from school.

Ellie says she had showed her headteacher a picture of the colour she wanted before having it done, and he said it would be fine - although she would have to wear her hair up.

Her mother, who lives in Doncaster, paid for her to have the colour done as a Christmas present.

Father Mark Douglas took her to a hairdresser earlier this week but they were told Ellie would have to wait to re-dye it because to do it so soon would damage her hair.

He said that despite having the colour toned down with a colour wash, the school still insisted Ellie remain in isolation.

The earliest she can go back to the hairdresser in Doncaster where she had it done is January 31.

Ellie claimed one teacher told her that red and purple were 'normal' colours, but that her shade was unacceptable.

The student, who is also facing having her prefect badge taken from her, said: 'It's wrong that people are allowed purple and red hair when I can't have blue.

'It's really stressful. Even though it's a Christmas present I've compromised. 

'I'm quite angry and upset that the school won't compromise with me.'

Ellie is predicted to get all As and A-stars in her GCSEs and has ambitions to be a geneticist.

But she has missed mock exams for two of her favourite subjects, Chemistry and Physics, because of being out of school.

Mr Douglas says he plans to raise a formal complaint.

He said: 'She's a prefect and an A-star student. She's never once been in trouble in any school she's been in.

'I just think it's so wrong.'

Halewood Academy has been contacted by MailOnline for comment.
