Smirking: Boden Hughes, 26, had been drinking on board the vessel when he set a pile of clothes alight

A PASSENGER who sparked  an £800,000 blaze while smoking  cannabis on board a ferry has been jailed for 11 years.

Boden Hughes – who had been drinking heavily – risked the lives of almost 1,000 people when he started a fire in cabin 568 on the King Seaways DFDS ferry on December 28.

Some 27 passengers and crew needed treatment for smoke inhalation as flames quickly spread out into the ship’s corridor.

Six people, including a pregnant woman, had to be winched from the vessel by helicopter, Newcastle Crown Court heard.

The fire, which started when the ship was 25 miles out to sea during darkness, caused panic to spread through the boat, with  children standing on deck in tears.

Amid the confusion, Hughes then got involved in a fight with a passenger.

The vessel, which was bound for Amsterdam, was forced to return to its departure point in North Shields, North Tyneside.

The 946 passengers on board faced having their trips cancelled.

Hughes, 27, of Sunderland, admitted reckless arson on the basis he started the fire accidentally when his lighter set ablaze some clothes on his bed.

Judge James Goss, QC, sentenced him to nine years for arson and affray, which he admitted, as well as two years for his involvement in a copper cable theft conspiracy, to which he also pleaded guilty. The judge said the last example of fire on board a similar vessel resulted in the death of 159 people, who perished on the Scandinavia Star in 1990.

The judge said he agreed with  the prosecution’s description of Hughes’s ‘spectacular recklessness’ in using a naked flame to try to smoke cannabis.

‘The consequences could have been disastrous,’ the judge said.

‘Panic was caused, passengers were injured by reason of smoke inhalation and an £800,000 loss caused to the ferry operator.’

He added: ‘Fires on a ship are even more serious than those on land. The escape routes are limited, the stability of the vessel can be affected by use of water to extinguish the flames. This is an offence of the highest culpability.’ The court heard Hughes had boarded the ferry with his girlfriend and another couple.

After drinking in the ship’s bars he had to be helped back to his cabin by a member of the crew.

Fire: The DFDS ferry (file picture) was diverted back to the North Shields terminal after the blaze broke out

Disruption: Passengers disembarking the ferry, which was diverted back to the terminal in December 2013

Costly: The judge said £800,000 in losses were caused to the ferry operator DFDS by the incident

Within minutes a smoke alarm went off 
and staff who went to investigate were met with a smoke-filled corridor.
 Hughes was crawling out of his cabin when the crew arrived.

Prosecutor
 Ian Lowrie, QC, told the court: ‘He was on all fours, half naked, going
 into the direction of the corridor.’ As the crew tried to fight the 
flames – which were eventually extinguished by the ship’s sprinklers – 
an evacuation was put into operation.

Mr Lowrie added: ‘Most of the passengers assembled on the upper decks. They were very scared, children were crying.

‘The crew noted people and  passengers beginning to exhibit  signs of panic.’

The court heard that while crew concentrated on the safety of the passengers, Hughes could still not be calmed.

Mr Lowrie said when he got to the deck he met a passenger and got into a fight.

The
 court heard any fire on board a ship creates a ‘race against time’ 
because any water used on the flames makes the vessel unstable.

The
 £800,000 cost of the blaze comprised £80,000 worth of repairs, a 
£30,000 fee because the ship was forced to change course, £25,000 for 
medical evacuations, £475,000 on passenger refunds, £175,000 loss of 
revenue and £25,000 legal and other costs, the court was told.

Christopher Morrison, defending, said Hughes was ‘extremely sorry to all concerned’, especially those who had to be airlifted.

He
 added: ‘He wants to say sorry to the company, to the passengers whose 
enjoyment was ruined and to all passengers and crew concerned in the 
obvious panic.’
