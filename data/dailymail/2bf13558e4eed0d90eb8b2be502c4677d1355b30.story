Lionel Messi made a young fan's night by scribbling his autograph on to a matchday programme before Argentina's 2-1 win against Croatia at Upton Park. 

The young boy looked delighted after getting the chance to meet the Barcelona superstar ahead of the international friendly at West Ham's home ground. 

Messi scored the winning goal from the penalty spot which would have made the young fan's memento even more special.

Croatia went ahead in the 11th minute through Anas Sharbini, however Argentina claimed the victory thanks to goals by Manchester City forward Sergio Aguero and Messi.

Former West Ham star Carlos Tevez, who replaced Aguero in the 61st minute, received a good reception on his return to Upton Park. 

Tevez and fellow countryman Javier Mascherano plied their trade at West Ham before eventually joining Manchester United and Liverpool respectively.  

One fan made his way on to the field before taking a selfie with the Juventus star.
