It is perhaps a sad indictment of the English game that no Premier League side came in for Britt Assombalonga this summer, but their loss is very much Nottingham Forest’s gain.

The £5.5million Forest’s Kuwaiti owners forked out to sign a 21-year-old striker who had never scored above League One level was a risk clearly no top flight side was prepared to take.

But in his three appearances so far for Stuart Pearce’s outfit, Assombalonga is already looking like a Premier League striker, let alone a Championship one.

Prolific: Assambalonga has scored three goals in his last two games for new side Nottingham Forest

Worth the risk: No Premier League club came in for Assombalonga despite his impressive goalscoring record

From a tap-in to a long-range effort, left foot, right foot or header, the ex-Peterborough and Watford man is capable of any type of finish, as he showed on his way to scoring 33 goals in all competitions for Posh last season. He has three already this campaign.

The English transfer market is an inflated one, of that there is no doubt, but when put into the context of Ross McCormack’s £11.5m move to Fulham, Assombalonga looks a relative snip.

It is, however, easy to see why Wigan manager Uwe Rosler felt the need to bemoan the Championship transfer market after his side’s 1-0 defeat by Cardiff - no slouches themselves when it comes to opening the coffers - on Tuesday night.

‘The transfer market is destroyed this year, in terms of the money that has been paid for certain positions,’ he told BBC Radio Manchester.

‘We have a strong team but where we lack is up front so we need to strengthen in that area. It’s not easy, especially when you’re driving a football club in a responsible way like we do.’

Assombalonga is not alone in learning his trade outside the top flight due to a lack of willingness from Premier League clubs to sign young, home-grown strikers.

Jordan Rhodes cost Blackburn £8million two years ago and has proved to be worth that outlay with a prolific goal return, yet he is still in the Championship. 

Rhodes’ Scotland international team-mate, Derby’s Chris Martin, as well as Bournemouth’s Callum Wilson and Norwich’s Lewis Grabban are all of an ability that would see them playing top flight football by this stage of their careers in any other era.

Highly-rated: Jordan Rhodes has proved to be a quality striker in the Championship

What the current climate does do though is make the Championship increasingly relevant for the English national team.

With a dearth of English strikers currently playing regularly in the top flight, Roy Hodgson may well look to the second tier and specifically Assombalonga to add firepower to his ranks.

But he needs to hurry, earlier this month Assombalonga, who moved to England aged eight months, was put on the provisional list for DR Congo’s 2015 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign.

The Congo-born striker has not yet declared his international allegiance but is still eligible for England’s Under 21 side.

‘Having those two options does give you a bit of relief,’ Assombalonga told Sportsmail last year. ‘If you have got parents from different countries then you do wonder who you should play for.’

One thing is for sure though, regardless of his international future, if Assombalonga can keep up his goalscoring record he will find himself in the Premier League before too long.

Forest sit top of the Championship tree following Tuesday night’s 2-1 win at Bournemouth and on the evidence of the first three games of the season they look to have the best striker in the division too. 

 Cod Army flying high

Fleetwood Town maintained their 100 per cent start to the season in League One with a 2-0 win at Scunthorpe on Tuesday night.

Graham Alexander’s side, who were promoted in May via the play-offs, have conceded just once in their opening three games and already look like contenders for back-to-back promotions.

The only other two sides in the Football League with a perfect record so far are Morecambe and Burton Albion in League Two.

Morecambe’s 1-0 win over Oxford United on Tuesday night consigned the Us to a third consecutive defeat and they already find themselves nine points adrift of Jim Bentley’s side despite the polarised pre-season predictions for both clubs.

Talent scout: Jed Wallace (Portsmouth)

Portsmouth are living up to their billing a pre-season favourites for promotion from League Two after collecting seven points from their opening three games, and Wallace has played a key role so far. 

The attacking midfielder only turned 20 in March but has already scored 15 goals in 75 appearances for Pompey, including two in their first three league games of the season. 

A goal from the former England Under 19 international and one from Craig Westcarr were enough to see of Northampton Town on Tuesday night.
