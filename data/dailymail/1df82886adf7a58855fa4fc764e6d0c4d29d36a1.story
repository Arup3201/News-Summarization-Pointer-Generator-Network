A Mercedes-Benz convertible crashed into a lobby at CNN Center in Atlanta early Friday morning.

Authorities responded to the crash at approximately 4:15am, Atlanta police officer John Chafee told MailOnline in an emailed statement.

Chafee said the driver, 22-year-old Gerlmy Javon Todd, was in possession of marijuana and told police he smoked marijuana before the crash. Todd told police that he fell asleep after driving all night long, Chafee said.

Chafee said that no one was injured.

Todd 'was taken into custody and is being charged with DUI Less Safe, Reckless Driving and Possession of Marijuana,' Chafee said.

Todd has had multiple drug offenses in Florida, the Atlanta-Journal Constitution says.

Though Todd wasn't seen early Friday morning in footage filmed by MyFoxAtlanta, the car's female passenger was seen removing her belongings from the car.

'You're wasting your time,' the woman was filmed saying.

The woman also appeared upset when pressed to speak on-camera by a WTVR crew.

'Can you just tell us what happened?' reporter Rebekka Schramm asked.

'If you give me some money, I will,' the woman said.

When asked by Schramm if she was the driver, the woman said 'Get out of my face - like I'm serious, get out of my face. You look tacky. Your outfit - you need help, lady. Get out of my face like seriously.'

Both Todd and the unidentified female passenger refused medical treatment, Chafee said.

CNN ended up reporting on itself and shared a photo of the crash on Twitter.

'"Breaking" news at CNN Center - a driver crashed into our lobby! Fortunately no injuries,' the channel tweeted.

By 7 a.m., workers were sweeping up glass shards. A section of glass of around 10 feet high and about 15 feet long was completely gone.Â
