Not good enough: Campaigners say restaurant chains and pubs are still full of burgers, nuggets and sausages

Most high-street restaurants and pubs still have menus dominated by nuggets, burgers and sausages, a new study has found.

Healthy
eating campaigners, the Soil Association, says the industry is still 
'churning out the usual suspects' and must improve standards if Britain 
is to win the battle against increasing childhood obesity.

An investigation found eight out of 21 restaurants did not have any vegetables or salad in their children's menus and 11 did not have any fruit on offer as a children's dessert.

The charity also ranked the chains 
based on their nutritional standards, sourcing policies, children's 
facilities and the experiences of 40 families who visited them over a 
period of three months.

Jamie's Italian was ranked top of the
list alongside Wagamama's and Wetherspoons while Burger King, KFC and 
Prezzo were the three lowest.

But overall, 12 out of 21 restaurants have menus filled with nuggets, burgers and sausages.

And 66 per cent of parents think food provision for children in restaurants is not good enough.

In another worrying find in the wake of 
the horsemeat scandal, only one restaurant, Jamie's Italian, could 
reliably tell secret diners where their meat had come from.

Study: The table was based on nutritional standards, sourcing policies, children's facilities and the experience of 40 mystery diners

Jamie Oliver, who launched Jamie’s 
Italian in 2008, said: 'Since the first Jamie’s Italian opened we’ve always kept
things kid-friendly with our funky viewfinder menus and super-tasty 
food, so to come top of the table is a fantastic achievement, and more 
importantly, confirmation that we're doing things right.

'We believe that the quality of the 
kids’ food should to be right up there on the same level as the main 
menu, and I truly believe that we have a brilliant offering that both 
kids love and parents can trust.

'Over the years, I’ve learnt that if 
you give kids a bit of ownership over their food, they’ll really embrace
it, so that's exactly what we’ve done with our “shake me” salads. Every
dish on the kid's menu comes with one and it counts as one of a child’s
five a day. I’ve seen parents completely amazed that their kids are 
eating salad, and that's down to the fact that they’ve been involved and
had fun putting it together.'

Top rated: A survey based on the experiences of 40 families rated Jamie's Italian, pictured, as the best for children's food

Burger King, which admitted that some of its burgers contained contaminated meat earlier this year, came bottom of the list.

A spokesman said: 'At Burger King UK 
Ltd. we are committed to offering a welcoming environment for families 
in our restaurants, and to providing parents with a range of options to 
allow them to make healthy choices for their children.

'This
includes offering them apple fries, milk, water or juice in our kids’ 
meals. Our sourcing policy is rooted in ingredients that deliver the 
best quality, freshness and taste for our food, with more than two 
thirds of our products locally sourced.

Pleased: Chef Jamie Oliver said coming top of the league table was a 'fantastic achievement'

Jamie Oliver, the world's richest chef, has been campaigning for almost a decade to improve the diet of Britain's children.

Back
in 2007, he helped push through a minimum nutritional standard for 
state school meals on the back of his television series Jamie's School 
Dinners.

The father-of-four
went into school canteens and encouraged cooks to drop fatty foods of 
their menus in favour of healthier options.

Sweets, fizzy drinks and crisped were taken out of vending machines.

Some
children complained and took to bringing in crisps and chocolate to 
sell to their classmates, but studies have shown may have led to 
improved exam results.

Scrapping
junk food in primary schools led to a 4.5 per cent boost in English SAT
results the schools where the scheme was first tried.

And
take up of school meals has steadily increased with two-thirds of 
primary school children and a third of high school children now opting 
to eat them.

But Oliver
has recently criticised Education Secretary Michael Gove, accusing him 
of undoing the good work after his controversial decision to allow 
academies to be exempt from minimum nutritional standards.

'Burger King UK Ltd. is committed to working collaboratively with Government, industry and the public health community.'

The ranking of Wetherspoons in third 
place may raise a few eyebrows, but food development manager Jameson 
Robinson said it is not surprising.

'We are very pleased to be recognised for the work we have undertaken on our children’s menu.

'Wetherspoon
serves more than two million children’s meals each year across our pubs
and appreciate the importance of sourcing UK ingredients and offering 
balanced meals.

'We know 
that there is still more work to do to enhance the menu further, 
including offering varying portion sizes and we will be working towards 
this.'

Bottom of the class: Burger King was the lowest-rated restaurant for the quality of its food provision for children

The Out to Lunch 
campaign, launched by the Soil Association and organic baby food brand 
Organix, is calling on all restaurants to improve standards by offering 
the choice of a children's portion of adult meals among other demands.

Joanna
Lewis, from the Soil Association, said: 'Our investigation reveals that
most high street restaurants are not even meeting the most basic 
standards families should expect when they eat out.

'Most
are still churning out children’s menus dominated by the usual suspects
– burgers, nuggets and pizzas –turning the table into a battlefield for
any parents wanting their child to eat well.

'With
one in three children now overweight or obese by the time they leave 
primary school, it’s time for these popular chains to use their 
influence in a positive way.

'Restaurants need to raise the bar and listen to parents who are saying they want fresh food not ready meals for their children, and the same kind of variety you’d expect as an adult.'

Anna Rosier, from Organix, an organic baby food brand which co-authored the research, said the best way for families to force restaurants to improve standards is to 'vote with their feet'.

She said: 'Four out of ten parents told us they eat out once a fortnight or more with their families. If restaurants and pubs want to ensure business stays strong and see customers return, they need to start improving what they’re serving to children.'
