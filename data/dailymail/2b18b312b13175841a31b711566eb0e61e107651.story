Youngest ever: At just 17, MArtha is the youngest ever Bake Off contestant, and says 'my head is always in the kitchen'

While her classmates are up to their eyes in revision and coursework, schoolgirl Martha is up to her elbows in cake mix – as the Great British Bake Off returns.

The 17-year-old is the youngest contestant ever to join the programme, which begins its fifth series in a new slot on BBC One next week.

The pupil from Berkshire said: ‘I may be in school, but my head is always in the kitchen.’

She will be battling it out for the show’s title with rivals including a former Merchant Navy man, a barefoot runner and a part-time beekeeper – as well as 69-year-old Diana, the oldest ever contestant.

And in a bid to whet our appetites for the new series, producers have lifted the lid on some of the Bake Off’s secret ingredients, which include runners stationed at supermarkets, Victoria sponge oven tests and 160 hours of washing up.

Insiders also admitted they were nervous following the last year’s ‘carnage’, when a number of contestants injured themselves with sharp knives. ‘We have new knives every year, and the knives are … good,’ the show’s home economist Faenia Moore said.

‘If [the contestants] are nervous and used to using crummy knives at home, and cutting, and talking to camera, I have to say: “Please watch your fingers.”

‘Last year it was carnage, but this year it’s been injury-free.’

The show has its own washer-upper who cleans every piece of equipment by hand because dishwashers are too noisy during filming.

Iva Vcelak got through 1,000 cloths, 80 sponges and 30 litres of washing-up liquid during 160 hours at the sink this year.

Producers also revealed that before each series, a dozen Victoria sponge mixes are prepared and cooked just to check each oven is working properly.

Fraternising is also strictly off the menu, with judges put up in different hotels to the contestants to maintain a professional distance.

And if you think baking decent fairy cakes will be enough to qualify for the show, think again. The military-style whittling-down operation involves an enormous 16,000 hopefuls and includes a lengthy application form, an interview, auditions and a baking screen test.

‘It is a huge process for us to get to the final 12,’ executive producer Anna Beattie told Radio Times. ‘We usually have two standbys, just in case someone pulls out at the last minute or is ill. But only for the first show or two. Then we are up and running.’

Producers also revealed the extraordinary lengths the behind-the-scenes staff go to in ensuring the show bubbles along smoothly.

On filming days a runner is stationed at the nearest big supermarket, just in case contestants make any last-minute amendments to their recipes.

‘If our bakers want rose petals from Kensington or cheese from Devon, we will get it for them,’ Miss Moore added. ‘I come equipped with duct tape and a marker pen so I can blank out the product name, since there must be no advertising in the show.’

The series starts on Wednesday, August 6, at 8pm on BBC One. There will also be a spin-off show called Extra Slice on BBC Two.
