The duel between Owen Farrell and Jonny Wilkinson will make Saturday's Heineken Cup final extra special.

It is Jonny's last game in Britain before he retires and he is up against the young guy who has taken over the England No 10 shirt he wore for so long.

It's a battle capable of capturing everyone's imagination.

Flat out for glory: Saracens fly-half Owen Farrell leads the charge for European success

In the zone: Saracens fly-half Owen Farrell practices his place-kicking on Friday

It's normal to compare and contrast opposition players but these two have many similarities. They faced each other in the semi-finals last year and, if anything, Owen has become more like Jonny since then.

Farrell comes across as quite shy off the field, uninterested in the limelight and wanting to focus on improving his game, just like Wilkinson. On the field, both are in their element running the show.  Farrell has learned to control and channel his aggression - just as Jonny has always done - and his greater maturity has improved his game.

Defensively, Wilkinson set new standards for his position and Farrell is a hugely committed tackler. He has the same toughness his dad Andy was known for in rugby league and union.

Owen wants the ball all the time, more so than Jonny, but still has to learn when not to commit to rucks. We spent a lot of time stopping Wilkinson from getting drawn into the breakdown and Farrell tends to be in there more than he should. He will learn it is not a slight on his toughness to keep out of that  contact area and focus on running the show. He needs to be on his feet, ready to act as first or second receiver.

Over the past year Farrell has made a lot more half-breaks,  holding up the ball, using his footwork and putting people into space. He is also scoring more tries. This stems from playing flatter to the line, which means you don't have to be super-fast in order to off-load and score.

Jonny is rightly earning huge praise as his career is about to end. At his peak he was the best in his position in the world and I believe Farrell can achieve the same  status. Perhaps we may soon see Wilkinson coaching him as part of the England set-up - now, that could become a great partnership.

Final fling: Jonny Wilkinson's playing his last game in Britain

One of the reasons Wilkinson has been so effective for Toulon has been the presence of Matt Giteau. Having a ball-playing inside centre alongside him is key for Jonny and Giteau is one of the few players I've seen who would have pushed hard to make my 2003 England team. He has special qualities, like Will Greenwood and Mike Catt had, which they used to help bring out the best in Jonny.

He plays so well next to a 12 who keeps talking to him and has the ability to play at 10, so can step in at first receiver if needed. Giteau fulfils that role at Toulon and that takes pressure off Wilkinson. With both men in the side, Toulon have an ideal left-footer, right-footer combination.

Saracens have Brad Barritt, a top defensive player, at 12. He doesn't offer the same attacking support to Farrell. Defence coaches are happy to have a basher in that position - someone who will make tackles and run hard - but against the best teams you need another ball-player who can pass and kick to the highest standards.

As a coach, you know that if you have a genuine 10 standing on either side of a ruck, your team will be a much greater attacking threat than if you just have one man trying to orchestrate everything.

I was in France to watch Toulon play Leinster in the quarter-finals and was very impressed. They have so much power married with great skill but they rely a lot on Mathieu Bastareaud for momentum in midfield.

I would put him in the same bracket as Manu Tuilagi; he could be one of the world's top players but needs to refine his game. He smashes into people time after time, without looking for the off-load, but he does put  his side on the front foot; then Wilkinson and Giteau line up on either side of the ruck, ready to use the space if they get quick ball.

Toulon also have plenty of big, ball-carrying forwards, like Danie Rossouw. They also have a broad skills set. The best example is Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe, the Argentina captain in their back row. Like Wilkinson, he has been a huge asset to the club and sets standards on and off the field.

I know Toulon coach Bernard Laporte from when I was coaching England and he was in charge of France. He has one of the hardest club jobs in rugby. It is a bit like coaching Real Madrid. If you win a trophy, everyone says that is what should happen, because you have so many amazing players. If it goes wrong, your career could be in tatters.

Pressure: Toulon coach Bernard Laporte has one of the hardest club jobs in rugby

Having so many top players at one club requires great management and Bernard deserves credit for creating a positive environment. There is unity and focus among the players, which is not easy to achieve. Some observers have criticised Toulon for using brute force and not creating enough opportunities for runners like Bryan Habana, Drew Mitchell and Delon Armitage. But their approach has been very effective.

A lot of French clubs play in a pragmatic, power-based way, but the French haven't lost their creative spark - not when they have brilliant centres such as Wesley Fofana and Gael Fickou. I'd expect them to be in with a real chance by the time the World Cup arrives.

Danger: Saracens smashed Clermont Auvergne in the Heineken Cup semi-final

I'm a fan of how Saracens have developed and of the relentless nature of their game. Their chairman, Nigel Wray, sets the tone. He has been around since the game went pro and has  committed time, energy and money to make the club a force.

They meet pressure with pressure. There is so much focus on winning turnovers and when they achieve that, they go for the jugular. They play with tempo, attacking intent and an incredible work ethic. All their attributes were displayed in the semi-final last month when they smashed Clermont Auvergne, who I expected to beat them at Twickenham.

Chris Ashton is one of Saracens' most potent weapons.

Whether or not he is the best winger in England is open to debate but if asked if I would like to coach him, the answer would be a definite 'yes'.

Threat: Chris Ashton is one of Saracens' most potent weapons

Ashton is a consistent try-scorer and is very good at tracking the ball but he should work on his tackling and beating defenders on the outside.

His speed isn't in question and if afforded space he'll hurt you, but I'd like to see him master the art of deception better so that he can create space for himself.

It is a contest between Toulon's big-match, big-name players, who will want to win it for Jonny, and Saracens' work ethic and team spirit. If it was a wet winter night, Toulon would be more vulnerable. Under the  Millennium Stadium roof, I think they will win, just.
