For decades they cheerfully offended millions of TV viewers and cinemagoers with their attacks on religion and the Establishment.

But Monty Python have finally succumbed to the censor.

They gave one of their songs a politically correct makeover for the troupe’s sold-out reunion shows at London’s O2.

The stars dropped potentially offensive lines from their 1980 song I Like Chinese.

In the original version of the song, written by Eric Idle, he used to sing: ‘I like Chinese, I like Chinese, They only come up to your knees, Yet they’re always friendly, and they’re ready to please.’

But in the version performed at the O2, Idle now sings: ‘I like Chinese, I like Chinese. They copy everything they sees.

But they’re up on the boom so they’ll do as they please.’

Fellow Python Terry Jones said: ‘Eric obviously knows why he changed the lyrics. I suppose it was dropped for reasons of political correctness.

‘Why keep singing “they only come up to your knees”?’

Jones said the changes had not been an issue for the rest of the team and added that they had been made ‘silently’.

Idle wrote the song for the group’s 1980 Contractual Obligation album. He has also dropped the lines ‘They are cute and they are cuddly and they’re ready to please’ and ‘There’s 900 million of them in the world today. You better learn to like them; that’s what I say’.

The song is one of the musical highlights of the show and is performed with elaborate sets and backing dancers in oriental costume. Idle is later joined on stage by his fellow Pythons who sing the chorus in Mandarin.

New additions to the song include the line: ‘I Like Chinese, I Like Chinese. They’re still a little Communese [sic], But Americans don’t need to fret now China has bought all their debt.’

The ten-night run of shows still contain explicit, bad language and jokes about the Catholic church, including the song Every Sperm Is Sacred.

Some critics have dismissed the show’s scantily clad female dancers as sexist and some of the portrayals as homophobic.

In the past the stars – who provoked uproar with their 1979 film The Life Of Brian – have strongly resisted attempts to censor their work.

The controversial song has always been something of a guilty pleasure for fans, and one tweeted: ‘I’m surprised Monty Python sang I Like Chinese but thankfully the lyrics have been updated!’ But comedian John Sessions said he would have preferred the original version. ‘I think they should have left it exactly as it was. There is far too much PC piety around.’

Eric Idle was unavailable for comment last night.
