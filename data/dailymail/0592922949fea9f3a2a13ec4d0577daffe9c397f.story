Romelu Lukaku is en route to regaining his fitness ahead of the visit of old club Chelsea on Saturday, but Everton manager Roberto Martinez admits he will be without Steven Pienaar.

The duo were injured during the 2-2 draw against Arsenal and Martinez knows Pienaar's groin complaint will see him miss the visit of Jose Mourinho's side to Goodison Park.

But former Chelsea striker Lukaku, having completed a £28million move to Merseyside during the summer, looks likely to feature against his old employers as he has responded to treatment well. 

Chance: Romelu Lukaku leaves the field holding his boot during the 2-2 draw with Arsenal at Goodison Park

Out: Steven Pienaar will not be fit enough to face Chelsea when they visit Merseyside on Saturday evening

Gutted: Manager Roberto Martinez will be without Pienaar but looks likely to have Lukaku back in the running

'They have both been assessed,' said Martinez.

'Stevie P is going to miss the game at the weekend. He is the one that is going to take a little bit of time. Stevie is going to be out and he is going to join Arouna Kone and Bryan Oviedo who are the only other two players that are not available.

'Romelu, we will keep assessing him. He has reacted well in the 48 hours after the game. At the moment it is too early to know if he will be available at the weekend but I am quite positive with Rom.'

Darron Gibson is available  following a slow recovery from knee problems, and could make a first appearance of the season against Chelsea.

'Darron Gibson is fully fit and I consider him part of the squad,' Martinez continued. 'He will be ready from now on to join the group and compete for a place.'
