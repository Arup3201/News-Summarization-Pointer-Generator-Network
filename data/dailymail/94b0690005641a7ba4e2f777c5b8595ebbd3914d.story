Walking up the aisle in their wedding finery, they look like any other nervous couple about to tie the knot.

But this blushing bride has a secret camera hidden in her bouquet – and is about to expose the marriage as a sham.

Playing her part in a TV sting operation, undercover journalist Harriet Morter helped to reveal how easy it is for immigrants to marry Europeans for UK visas.

Sham: Undercover reporter Harriet Morter (right) took part in a TV sting, which involved attempting to set up a sham wedding with her 'fiance' Ali (left), in a bid to show how easy it is for immigrants to marry for passports

Disguise: Despite Ali believing he was marrying to get a passport, the blushing bride had a secret camera hidden in her bouquet to record the dramatic events

She met her Indian ‘fiance’, called Ali, through a self-styled sham marriage fixer who advertised her services on the classifieds website Gumtree.

Ali agreed to pay £5,000 to marry his British bride, while the fixer – known only as Elizabeth – was to take a further £400. Ali even offered Miss Morter an extra £10,000 if she would have a baby with him.

To make their relationship seem more authentic, he hired a Rolls-Royce to drive her to the register office and even took her shopping for a wedding dress.

The most difficult moment came before the big day, when the couple were interviewed by a registrar who wanted to make sure their love was real.

Amazingly, Ali forgot his bride’s address and couldn’t even name the borough where she lived – but they were still allowed to set a wedding date.

The filmmakers said the registrar, who was not named, did report his suspicions to the Home Office but the case simply ‘slipped through the net’.

The sham ceremony was only called off at the last moment, when the registrar asked if anyone present knew of any lawful impediment to the marriage.

At that point, journalist Paul Connolly – who was posing as Miss Morter’s best man with his own hidden camera in his button – stepped up and revealed they had filmed the entire process.

The pair met through a 'fixer' who advertised her services on Gumtree and Ali agreed to pay £5,000 to marry his British bride

In dramatic footage that will be shown on Channel 5 tomorrow, Ali is last seen fleeing from the register office.

Before the ceremony, he had boasted to the undercover team that he would use the marriage to get a British passport.

He explained he had been living on a student visa, despite the fact he never attended classes, and admitted he had been surviving on ‘cash in hand’ work.

As the visa was about to expire, he was urgently looking for a European bride to help him stay in the country.

Ali told Miss Morter she would be free to leave him immediately after the wedding ceremony, although they would have to wait five years before they divorced. 

I object! But Paul Connolly, pictured behind the couple, stopped the ceremony when the registrar asked the congregation if anyone had any objections to the marriage

Rumbled: The journalists said they never expected the ceremony, assuming it would be blocked by the safeguards that are in place - but it wasn't 

He even invented a back-story to help them fool the authorities, claiming they had met a year-and-a-half ago at Mile End tube station in East London when Miss Morter had lost her travel card. He told his prospective bride: ‘When I get the card, you can leave. That’s it, me and you. If I want a passport I need only one signature, that’s it.

‘I want to make money. Why do I have to go to university? I came here to make money.’

Interviewed on the programme, Mark Rimmer, superintendent registrar at Brent Council, said the number of sham marriages was ‘absolutely enormous’. He said: ‘In London we see that possibly one in five of our marriages are suspicious.

‘The goal is always the British passport. It is like gold dust.

‘We had a Lithuanian girl who spoke no English marrying a Pakistani male who spoke British and Urdu. I asked them how they communicate and they told me “through Google translate”.’

The journalists said they have made all their evidence available to the police. Mr Connolly said: ‘Neither Ali nor Elizabeth are hardened criminals. They tried to play the system, but lost.

Getaway: The groom is then seen fleeing from the register office. It is not known whether he was arrested or charged for attempting to set up a sham marriage

‘The truth is we never expected to end our investigation with a sham marriage ceremony. We assumed the road would be blocked by the safeguards that are in place. But it wasn’t.’

It is not known whether Ali or Elizabeth have been arrested or charged for attempting to set up a sham marriage.

Earlier this year, the Home Affairs select committee said that sham marriages are ‘spiralling out of control’ in the UK, with as many as 10,000 fake weddings carried out each year.

The filmmakers refused to name the registry office or the officials who gave permission for the ceremony because they were ‘testing the system, not seeking to... blame individuals’.

The Sham Wedding Crashers will be shown on Channel 5 tomorrow at 9pm.
