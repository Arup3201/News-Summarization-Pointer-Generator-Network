At the age of four, he's already been made a member of Mensa and achieved fame for his intellect.

But that wasn't enough for Sherwyn Sarabi, who is now being compared to Albert Einstein, Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking after recording an IQ score of 160.

The psychologist who tested Sherwyn, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, said his score - the highest possible on the Wechsler Scale - showed he has a 'very superior level of intelligence'.

Sherwyn Sarabi, four, has achieved an IQ score of 160 - the highest possible mark on the Whechsler Scale

His IQ score is the latest in a long line of grand achievements by Sherwyn, who joined Mensa when he was three years old.

He spoke his first words at ten months, was talking in full sentences at 20 months, and has been wowing his parents, teachers and doctors ever since.

Ten months: At less than one year old, Sherwyn spoke his first word

20 months: Ten months later, he was speaking in sentences

Two years: Sherwyn shoots to fame after learning to identify every country in the world. The toddler can also read up to 500 words, describe all major body organs and their functions, count to 200, identify shapes and explain volcanoes and shooting stars

Three years: Is made a member of Mensa and starts going to school

Four years: Sherwyn records an IQ score of 160, putting him on a par with Albert Einstein, Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking.

Now, Sherwyn has a mental age of eight years and nine months - more than twice his actual age - and is studying at that level.

Educational psychologist Dr Peter Congdon said: ‘Sherwyn has a very superior level of intelligence, he is incredibly gifted and his vocabulary is out of this world.

‘His intellect reaches the highest possible levels of reason and when he talks to you he has the social skills of a much older child.'

He added: ‘It is very unusual for a child to have this type of intelligence, he came out at the very top on the tests.

‘I specialise in specially gifted children but when I tested Sherwyn I knew I had come across something very special.’

While most four-year-olds have not yet 
started school, Sherwyn is already studying work for eight and 
nine-year-olds at Rastrick Independent School, Huddersfield.

Sherwyn’s mother, Amanda Sarabi, 37, a former teacher, said: ‘He is a very happy healthy child and loves to talk.

‘He questions everything and I have been doing my best to answer his questions to the best of my knowledge.'

She added: ‘His general knowledge is amazing for a four-year-old - I think it’s because of all the questions he asks all day long.'

Sherwyn, who is an only child, has read more than 940 books and, according to his mother, 'his favourite is the encyclopaedia as he loves learning new things.’

Mrs Sarabi, a former teacher, has given up 
work to care for her construction worker husband, Daroud, 37, as he recovers from a 
serious car accident.
