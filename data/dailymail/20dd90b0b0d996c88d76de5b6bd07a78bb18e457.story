He is Britain’s greatest sailor. So it should be no surprise that Sir Ben Ainslie hasn’t let a little patch of water like the Atlantic get in the way of his latest relationship.

The Olympic hero is dating former Sky Sports presenter Georgie Thompson, who has now made her home in New York – and is perhaps best known for going out with one half of Ant and Dec.

Sir Ben, 36, and Miss Thompson, also 36, have been in a steady relationship since April.

He has a £650,000 home in Lymington, Hampshire, although he has recently been living in San Francisco as he masterminded the US’s victory over New Zealand in the America’s Cup.

Sir Ben, who has won four gold medals and one silver over five Olympic Games, was previously with Dutch sailor Marit Bouwmeester, 25.

She won a silver in last summer’s Olympics at Weymouth on the same day as Sir Ben won his latest gold.

Privately educated Miss Thompson, is the former girlfriend of ITV star Declan Donnelly, one half of Geordie duo Ant and Dec.

The 36-year-old, now presenting for Fox Sports, was dating Declan Donnelly for two years until 2011

They split in 2011 after two years, with his apparent lack of decisiveness about their future together reportedly the issue, although she insists ‘there’s no animosity between us’.

The Leeds University graduate previously worked for Sky TV in the UK and is now a presenter for Fox Sports in the US.

The couple have known each other for three years. In an interview with this Saturday’s forthcoming issue of the Daily Mail’s Weekend magazine, Miss Thompson said: ‘We met through friends at an event – and I don’t really know how to describe it.

They have known each other for three years. Thompson describes their meeting as 'a thunderbolt moment'

‘It was a bit of a thunderbolt moment but a thunderbolt that took years before it became anything real. We were in different places but then in April the stars aligned and it made sense to be together, and we haven’t looked back since. It’s very special – he makes me very happy.’

Now Sir Ben’s America’s Cup stint is over, Miss Thompson says they will be able to spend more time together – although last week he flew back to Britain.

In a recent interview, he hinted that a family may soon be on the cards. ‘I better sort that out at some stage soon,’ he said.

‘I’m getting a bit old, turning into a bit of a wrinkly old seadog.’
