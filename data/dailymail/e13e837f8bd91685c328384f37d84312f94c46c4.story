There were 11 English players on the pitch when Southampton kicked off against Liverpool, and two more came on. What a good advert it was for investing in homegrown talent.

Southampton had six Englishmen in their starting XI, and Roy Hodgson has four of them in his England squad. Adam Lallana was the best player on the pitch in the first half and showed great touch and vision, while Luke Shaw proved why he can be England’s left back for years to come. As Liverpool took over Southampton faded but Liverpool’s English contingent then came to the fore.

Raheem Sterling is one of the country’s best wingers but came on to play at the point of a midfield diamond. It shows how much Brendan Rodgers works with his young players and improves them. Daniel Sturridge continues to play well and Steven Gerrard was as reliable as ever. Liverpool’s title challenge rolls on and it was satisfying to see two sides playing good football with a core of English players.

The League Cup might not be the biggest competition in the world, but that won’t matter one bit to Manuel Pellegrini. When he arrived he was criticised for not winning a major trophy but he has played a strong side throughout, just as Jose Mourinho did in his first season at Chelsea, and now he has one in the bag. They might struggle to get through in the Champions League but who’s to say they can’t go on and win a domestic treble?

Maiden: Manuel Pellegrini won his first piece of silverware as Manchester City boss

Stunner: Yaya Toure scored a brilliant goal to equalise at Wembley

It was a good weekend for goals with Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri scoring cracking efforts in the cup final. But Christian Benteke’s first goal was one of the best I’ve seen in a long time.

It was an important result too for Aston Villa. They have had some problems playing at home this season — sometimes the players seem to freeze up — but it should be a joy. A result like this will get the confidence flowing again.

Brilliant: Christian Benteke scored a wonder goal against Norwich

We can’t be sure of what Jose Mourinho did or didn’t say in the dressing room at Fulham but one thing is for certain: it worked.

Jose claims he gave his players the silent treatment but Andre Schurrle said his manager had a few words.

When I was a player I never had a boss that didn’t say anything at half-time. There were plenty who would chuck things around — my dad liked to throw a sandwich or two at Bournemouth — but it was rarely quiet. Maybe he has just started a new trend? Whatever he did, it had the desired effect.

Silent treatment: Jose Mourinho didn't say anything at half-time of Chelsea's win at Fulham

Improved: Drawing 0-0 at half-time, Chelsea went on to win 3-1 thanks to an Andre Schurrle hat-trick

Andre Schurrle is the third German to score a Premier League hat-trick after Fredi Bobic and Jurgen Klinsmann.

There has been a lot of talk about Chelsea’s forwards this season but the club has always had good goalscoring midfielders. Frank Lampard has done it for years, Eden Hazard gets his share and Andre Schurrle could join them.  He seemed a bit out of the frame, so I was slightly surprised by his hat-trick, but credit to Mourinho for playing him there. Schurrle is so fast and used that pace to get in behind the Fulham defence. He linked up well with Hazard, no more so than for his first goal, as our graphic below shows.

Opener: Schurrle applied a calm finish to a neat team move for the first goal

What Alan Pardew did was one of the most extraordinary things I’ve seen in football.

You cannot behave like that and it’s the last thing you would expect from a manager.

He is supposed to set the standard and football should do more to try and prevent incidents like this. But let’s not kid ourselves. The game has always had tension bubbling just under the surface.

Extraordinary: Newcastle boss Alan Pardew headbutted Hull City's David Meyler

That is no excuse and Pardew deserves to be reprimanded but there are short memories in football.

Luis Suarez bit a man last year but has been the player of the season so far. If it goes well on the pitch your problems can be quickly forgiven.

Newcastle acted quickly to punish Pardew so it seems they want to keep him. With a ready-made excuse this would have been an easy time to sack him and I feared for Pardew: it’s a lot easier to dismiss a manager than it is to get rid of a player worth £50m. But it looks like the club are standing by their man, for now at least.

Fine: Pardew was fined £100,000 by the club for his actions

All credit to Stoke for the way they beat Arsenal. They can add that to impressive home wins over Chelsea and Man United and a good draw with Man City, but it is clear Arsenal are missing Aaron Ramsey. At the start of the season his driving runs and goals took Arsenal to the top of the table and they need him back ASAP. They also miss Theo Walcott’s pace, and it was a shame that he was in the studio with me on Saturday rather than on the pitch working his magic.

Sparkling: Ramsey was in brilliant form earlier this season before he was struck down with injury

When Spurs signed Roberto Soldado I thought they had a real player on their hands. You don’t score the goals he did in La Liga without quality. For whatever reason it’s not quite worked out for him but now he has one I would not be surprised at all if he goes on a scoring run.

Relief: Tottenham striker Roberto Soldado scored his first goal of 2014

Felix Magath might be the first German manager in the Premier League, but there is one in the Championship who has his side flying. Since taking over Uwe Rosler has nine wins in 14 league games with Wigan and has taken them from 15th to sixth. Don’t be surprised if he is the next German managing in the top flight.

Struggling: The Premier League's first German manager, Fulham's Felix Magath, is still languishing at the bottom

Flying high: Wigan boss Uwe Rosler has nine wins in 14 since taking over
