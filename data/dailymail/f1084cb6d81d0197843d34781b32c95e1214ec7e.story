Wear Spanx 'so you don't have to worry about sucking in all the time or being bloated'.

Switch your glasses for contact lenses because 'poking your eyes is worth it just this once'.

And make sure you choose 'something cute and Alpha Chi' for your Facebook profile picture.

These are just a few of the terrifying beauty and social standards that the sorority girls of Alpha Chi Omega at the University of Southern California are told to adhere to during Polish Week.

Strict: The beauty and social standards that the sorority girls of Alpha Chi Omega (pictured) at the University of Southern California have to adhere to during Polish Week have been revealed in an anonymous email

The strict guidelines were revealed in an  email, titled: 'Personal Development/Recruitment Info' and sent to Jezebel by an anonymous sorority girl, who has since graduated from the university.

They standards were written up and distributed to AXO girls in 2013. But to this day, the sorority continues to uphold such provisions, according to the news site. 

For the duration of the seven days - the week before the sorority rush starts - girls must wear their hair 'curly or straight', with 'one normal color - no crazy ombre, no color you wouldn't see in nature'.

They should also don proper undergarments, have neat eyebrows ('I know "full" eyebrows are in style right now, but "full" does not mean "BUSHY" or "WILD") and apply a full face of make-up.

This includes the use of foundation, concealer, mascara, 'something pinky neutral for lips', blot powder, eyeliner, neutral eyeshadow, bronzer and blush, as well as 'neutral pink' nail varnish. 

'If you are not wearing makeup, I will stop you and apply it myself,' the author of the guidelines wrote. 'I don't care if you're late for class I don't care if you're a sophomore or super senior. I will stop you.' 

Sorority Appearance Guidelines by jezebel2

In their wardrobes, AXO girls should possess gold sandals, a seaglass top, a black dress, a red dress, a Tiffany blue necklace, nude wedges and nude heels if they wish to remain popular.

And in terms of their diets, they must 'stay away from fried and super sugary foods' and exercise.

'Being sick or feeling gross during recruitment sucks. Start eating healthy today and you'll feel so much better by the time polish week and recruitment starts,' the author states.

'Stay away from fried and super sugary foods. Your face will seriously brighten up. Also, exercise. Start now and you'll have way more energy and endurance for the long hours of recruitment.' 

For a fuller list of the sorority's 2013 guidelines, see below:

Spanx

'I cannot express how important Spanx are to make you look your best! Even if you are very thin, Spanx give you a better "line" when you wear clothes (no awkward bumps!).

'Plus you don't have to worry about sucking in all the time or being bloated! Just make sure they don't show when you're wearing clothes (don't get ones with long legs when you're wearing shorts).'

Hair

'Please get your hair trimmed, roots touched up etc before work week... Remember: Your hair needs to be one normal color. No crazy ombre, no color you wouldn't see in nature.

'(Also if you're thinking about going from black to blonde or vice versa, do so after recruitment. You won't know for sure what it looks like, and if you hate it... that won't fly.'

'For recruitment, your hair has to be curly or straight. No waves.'

The guidelines add that if you have straight hair and want to wear it curly - 'don't'. 'It needs to be able to hold for 15-hour days and hairspray crunchy hair or limp hair is not acceptable,' they state.

Health

'Being sick or feeling gross during recruitment sucks. Start eating healthy today and you'll feel so much better by the time polish week and recruitment starts.

'Stay away from fried and super sugary foods. Your face will seriously brighten up. Also, exercise. Start now and you'll have way more energy and endurance for the long hours of recruitment.'

Eyebrows

'Bad eyebrows will make you look less beautiful than you actually are! Your eyebrows need to look neat (as in not messy) for recruitment.

'I know "full" eyebrows are in style right now, but "full" does not mean "BUSHY" or "WILD". If you have SPARSE BROWS then you need to fill them in. There are plenty of eyebrow kits out there.' 

Makeup

Girls must wear foundation, concealer, mascara, 'something pinky neutral for lips', blot powder, eyeliner, neutral eyeshadow, bronzer and blush.

'If you are not wearing makeup, I will stop you and apply it myself. I don't care if you're late for class. I don't care if you're a sophomore or super senior. I will stop you.'

Glasses

'We would like to strongly encourage that you wear contacts during recruitment. Obviously if that is not an option for you or if you are uncomfortable doing so it is by no means mandatory.

'However, we want the PNMs to be able to see your lovely eyes the best they can and strongly encourage wearing contacts over glasses. Poking your eyes is worth it just this once, promise!'

Social media

'Please make your profile pics, cover photos, etc. something cute and Alpha Chi. Don't use a picture where we're making ugly faces or are in a visibly not sober state!

'It might look fun to you, but it could appear sloppy or weird to outsiders.'
