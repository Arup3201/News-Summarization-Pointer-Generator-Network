Vicious: Father-of-six Nicholas Gough, who admitted wounding with intent

A teacher bit off his wife’s nose during a row – then tried to persuade her to tell doctors the family dog did it.

Nicholas Gough, 59, attacked his wife Lynne in their garden gazebo after drinking a bottle of wine.

The ‘possessive’ science teacher swore at the 52-year-old and held her down on the floor. He then sank his teeth into the end of her nose, leaving her face pouring with blood.

After the attack, Gough tried to persuade his wife to blame the injury on their pet.

Instead she reported him to the police and yesterday he was jailed for five years after admitting wounding with intent.

Sentencing him at Wolverhampton Crown Court, Judge Martin Walsh said the attack had left his wife ‘disfigured’ for life.

‘You grabbed her by the throat and tried to kill her,’ he said. ‘She has had to have three operations and required plastic surgery.’

Mrs Gough watched in the public gallery surrounded by family as the sentence was passed. Neither she nor her former husband showed any emotion as the sentence was handed out.

The couple had been married for 24 years and had three children together, as well as three others between them from previous relationships, the court heard.

Gough was a ‘well respected’ teacher of science at the West Bromwich Phoenix Collegiate Academy, and also worked as a volunteer for the NHS in his spare time.

But beneath the façade of their happy marriage, Gough was a jealous and possessive husband who constantly accused his wife of being unfaithful. In June last year, Mrs Gough left her husband for a work colleague, saying she had ‘had enough’ of his controlling behaviour.

But after her new partner died suddenly the following month, she reconciled their marriage and returned to their four-bedroom home near Wolverhampton. On the night of the attack last September, Gough had returned from work and drunk a bottle of wine in just half an hour.

Seeing his wife was upset over her deceased partner’s birthday,  he became ‘aggressive’, the prosecution said. Gough launched a tirade of abuse at his wife and accused her of having an affair with a soldier.

Hoping he would calm down, she left the house, returning 15 minutes later to sit in the gazebo of their garden.

But five minutes later, Gough reappeared and launched his attack. ‘He repeatedly punched Mrs Gough to the face using  both of his hands,’ prosecutor Sati Ruck said.

‘The defendant dragged her down the bench by her legs, pinned her arms down, placed his mouth over her nose and said, “No one will want you after what I am going to do to you”.

‘He then bit the tip of her nose.

‘The defendant then leaned in close and said, “Stop screaming, I am going to kill you”. He tried to strangle her, and said, “If I can’t have you no one else will”.’

Defending the teacher, John Rowe said he had suffered a breakdown due to the pressures on their marriage, as well as those he was facing at work.‘He stands before you a man in turmoil,’ Mr Rowe said.

‘He accepts responsibility for his actions. He can’t fully remember the incident.’

Mr Rowe added: ‘He was a positive role model for teachers and pupils at the school.

‘He was clearly a man who was a positive part of society for 59 years. He has found himself in a waking nightmare, a man tormented to despair at the thought of what he has done, the pain he has inflicted on his wife.’
