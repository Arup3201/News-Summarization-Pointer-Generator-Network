France's largest bank, BNP Paribas, has agreed to pay around £5.2 billion in compensation to resolve criminal allegations that it breached U.S. trade sanctions against blacklisted countries.

After months of negotiations the bank admitted violating sanctions by processing billions of dollars in illegal transactions on behalf of clients in Sudan, Cuba and Iran.

The transactions, which prosecutors say 
were processed through BNP's New York branch office between 2004 and 2012, were handled at the same time as human rights abuses - 
including the genocide in Sudan - were occurring in those countries.

Compensation: France's largest bank, BNP Paribas, has agreed to pay around £5.2 billion to resolve criminal allegations that it breached U.S. trade sanctions against blacklisted countries

Sanctions had been imposed on the countries by the U.S. in order to block 
their participation in the global financial system.

The U.S. Justice Department announced yesterday that the bank had admitted state charges in New York, and it is understood to be planning a further guilty 
plea in federal court next month.

'Sanctions are a key tool in protecting U.S. national security interests, but they only work if they are strictly enforced,' said Attorney General Eric Holder.

'If sanctions are to have teeth, violations must be strictly punished.'

The aim of such sanctions is to cut off an enemy nation's access to banks and other sources of capital, limiting its economic growth and ability to buy weapons, food and other items available through global trade.

The restrictions on dealings with sanctioned countries generally apply to U.S. banks and foreign banks with U.S. operations.

Sum: The deal, worth around $8.9 billion, or £5.2 billion, is the largest sanctions case brought by the Justice Department and the largest penalty in any criminal case involving a bank

The deal, worth around $8.9 billion, or £5.2 billion, is the largest sanctions case brought by the U.S. Justice Department and the largest penalty in any criminal case involving a bank.

Prosecutors say the penalty was necessary not only because of the sheer volume of the illicit transactions but also because of the bank's efforts to hide them and executives' lack of cooperation with the Justice Department.

In recent weeks, as the BNP deal inched closer, French officials had expressed deep concern about the punishment.

They lobbied for White House intervention and warned that a large penalty could affect the entire European economy and hold up a trans-Atlantic free trade agreement.

The French economy minister last week asked the Justice Department to be 'fair and proportionate' when deciding on the potential penalty.

President Francois Hollande wrote to the Obama administration in April asking for a 'reasonable' solution, but the US President deflected calls to get involved in the dispute.

On
 Monday, Paris-based BNP entered a guilty plea in state court in New 
York City to falsifying business records. The bank is expected to plead 
guilty in federal court on July 9 for conspiring to violate the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Trading With the 
Enemy Act.

It has also agreed to fire multiple senior executives and will lose its ability to process certain transactions in U.S. dollars for one year. No individual BNP executives were charged.

'We deeply regret the past misconduct that led to this settlement,' Jean-Laurent Bonnafe, CEO of BNP, said in a statement.

Probe: Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said the investigation into BNP started with a tip off to his office

'The failures that have come to light 
in the course of this investigation run contrary to the principles on 
which BNP Paribas has always sought to operate.'

The
 bank said in addition to provisions it has already taken, it will book a
 charge of 5.8 billion euros ($7.9 billion, or £4.6 billion) in the 
second quarter of this financial year.

Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said the investigation into BNP started with a tip off to his office.

'It is not hyperbole to say that the most important values in the international community — respect for human rights, peaceful coexistence, and a world free of terrorism — depend in large part on the effectiveness of these sanctions,' he added.

In recent years, U.S. authorities have pursued other large foreign banks for sanctions violations, though those matters have been resolved for smaller cash sums.

HSBC, Europe's largest bank, agreed to a $1.9 billion, or £1.1 billion, settlement with U.S. and New York authorities in connection with the transfer of billions of dollars on behalf of Iran, Cuba, Libya, Sudan and Myanmar.

Standard Chartered paid $340 million (£199 million) in a settlement with New York state regulators, who accused the bank of scheming with the Iranian government to launder billions of dollars.

The bank also paid $327 million (£191 million) to settle U.S. and New York charges related to currency transactions for Iranian, Sudanese, Libyan and Burmese entities, that were said to have been concealed from regulators.

In two separate similar investigations in France, authorities are also looking at Credit Agricole and Societe Generale, according to those involved in the probe. Together with BNP Paribas, they constitute France's top three banks.

The BNP announcement comes weeks after Credit Suisse struck a $2.6 billion (£1.5 billion) plea deal with the Justice Department for helping wealthy Americans avoid taxes.

Shortly before that case was brought, Mr Holder — whose Justice Department has been accused of not being aggressive enough in confronting bank misconduct — issued a video message declaring that no bank was too large to prosecute.
