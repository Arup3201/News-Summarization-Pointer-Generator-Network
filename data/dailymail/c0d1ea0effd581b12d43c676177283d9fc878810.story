A female prison officer has appeared in court charged with helping convicts smuggle drugs into the prison where she worked.

Julie Turton, 53, spoke only to confirm her name in a hearing at Birmingham Magistrates Court today.

She is accused of helping 25-year-old prisoner Arteef Hussain and his wife Shelah Arif, 25, smuggle cannabis into HMP Birmingham.

Turton has been charged with misconduct in a public office, conspiring to convey cannabis and supplying a Class-B drug.

The scheme is thought to have begun in November 2011 and continued to May of this year.

Hussain appeared via videolink from prison. Wearing a black tracksuit, he also remained silent except from confirming his name.

He is charged with conspiring to convey cannabis into a prison.

Arif also appeared, and was charged with the same crime and also one count of possessing a Class-B drug with intent to supply.

Turton, who lives in Birmingham, was bailed, and the case adjourned until a hearing at Birmingham Crown Court next week.

Head of the bench Michael Kershaw said: 'You will have unconditional bail'.

He too was bailed and ordered to attend another hearing next week.
