Obamacare is more unpopular than ever, a new poll finds, just as the state and federal health exchanges central to the health care reform law reopen for business. 

Americans looking to purchase health insurance for the upcoming year through the health care marketplace could do so beginning on Saturday. 

A Gallup poll released this morning shows that many are none too happy about, however, with just 37 percent of survey-takers saying they approved of the law requiring them to purchase health insurance or be fined by the government if they are not already insured by their employer.

Open enrollment into the federal health exchanges began on Saturday - just as a poll came out showing that most Americans disapprove of the health care reform law

The percentage of Americans who support the law has not topped the percentage who don't for the last two years.

But Gallup's latest poll shows perceptions of Obamacare steadily turning negative since this summer after briefly ticking upward earlier this year, and disapproval of the president's signature law now stands at a peak 56 percent. 

The negative survey follows reports from independent analysts that many of the 7 million Americans who participated in the health exchanges last year and plan to re-enroll this year will have to change plans if they don't want to see their premiums increase.

According to PricewaterhouseCoopers's Health Research Institute, premiums will rise on average 3.5 percent in 2015, though enrollees in some states could significantly lower premiums than before while others see wildly higher costs.

Republicans in Congress have pointed to the increased costs as a key reason  to gut the health care reform law, passed in 2010 when Democrats ruled the roost, and start from scratch.

The Affordable Care Act is anything but affordable, they have said, and Americans would be better off without it. 

Many Republicans who won midterm elections made Obamacare repeal a central theme of their campaigns, and the GOP has said one of their first acts in the new legislative session will be to call a vote on the issue. As of January, the Republican Party will control both the House and the Senate and will therefore be able to bring legislation undoing the law to the floor.

Republicans will hold a maximum of 54 seats in the Senate if they win a runoff election in Louisiana next month, however, putting them far short of the 67 votes they would need to overcome President Barack Obama's inevitable veto of the repeal legislation.

Recognizing that repeal is politically impractical, they have vowed to chip away at the law wherever possible until they receive the power to strip it entirely.

Obamacare approval hit a new low today, according to Gallup's latest survey

Meanwhile, a news report released this morning that coincides with the start of the second round of Obamacare enrollments claims that many of the positive comments posted throughout the last two years on a pro-Obamacare Facebook page operated by the president's allies were created by the same core group of users trying to tip the scales of the debate toward their side of the issue.

According to the Washington Times, 60 percent of the 226,838 comments posted on Organizing for Action's Obamacare Facebook page between September 2012 and October 2014 were created by fewer than 100 unique Facebook users - some of whom used multiple aliases to spread their message. 

One California woman who supports the law, Cindi Huynh, used four different Facebook accounts to post an average of 59 flatting comments about the law a day over a 60-day period, making her the top commenter for those two months.

Huynh told the Times she was not paid to post on the site, but its analysis of her posts shows that she only posted on the site during traditional work hours and never on weekends.

That was also the case for the other top 25 posters to the page, the Times found. 

Another woman named Wanda Milner who lives in Canada wrote 4,695 adulatory posts throughout the two-year period the Times' analysts reviewed, though Milner told the news publication that posts from other accounts in her name were not written by her and were instead meant to mock her zealous advocacy of the law.

Despite living outside the country, Milner says she too was not paid for her posts. Rather she said is just strongly supportive of health care overhaul in the U.S.

The managers of the page declined to return the Washington Times' request for confirmation that the Obamacare advocates were not being paid to promote the law.

At least one of the prolific posters, a retired veteran named Paul J. Nunley who lives in New Mexico, was protesting the law on the page, the Times also found.

Nunley wrote 2,316 anti-Obamacare posts in 60 days and was the second highest commenter during that period, just behind Huynh.

He told the Washington Times he's made it his full-time job to post on the page and 'rid it of misinformation.'
