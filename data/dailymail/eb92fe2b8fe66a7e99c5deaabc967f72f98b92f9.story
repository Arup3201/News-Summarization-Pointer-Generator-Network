A Japanese robot designed to withstand high levels of radiation and extreme heat at damaged nuclear plants froze as it was unveiled for the first time yesterday.

The failure occurred as Toshiba presented the four-legged device, forcing embarrassed technicians to meekly carry it away.

Although it is a world leader in robotics, Japan did not have a device capable of entering the damaged Fukushima nuclear facility after last year's devastating earthquake and tsunami.

Embarrassment: Toshiba engineers carry away their company's new four-legged, nuclear-proof robot after it froze during a its first public demonstration on its testing ground at the firm's Yokohama complex yesterday

Instead, authorities were forced to bring in U.S. robots to survey the extent of the damage inside the devastated reactor buildings.

Toshiba's machine, which was designed to plug the gap, is able to carry up to 20kg of equipment and is capable of lifting itself up if it falls over on uneven surfaces and amid debris.

Standing just over one metre tall, the Tetrapod robot weighs 65kg and is equipped with sensors to detect radiation levels and a camera so investigators can operate the machine from a safe distance.

Its multiple-jointed legs are controlled via a dedicated movement algorithm that gives it the ability to negotiate uneven surfaces, avoid objects and even climb stairs to reach areas wheeled robots cannot access.

The machine also carries a smaller companion robot mounted with a second camera which can be deployed via a folding arm to enter narrow spaces and tubes its mothership is too large to enter.

Toshiba said it is still developing the capabilities and operation of the robot to give it the ability to carry and install radiation shielding, stem flows of water and remove obstacles from its path.

However, it seems that they also have some more basic technical glitches to iron out as, during the demonstration, the robot experienced a case of stage fright.

The shuffling Tetrapod locked up and suddenly froze after it tried to balance itself.

It is the second time such Japanese robotic technology has experienced problems.

Last October, a crawling robot developed by the Chiba Institute of Technology lost connection with operators and was abandoned inside Fukushima's No. 2 reactor building.

Japan is home to the largest number of industrial robots in the world, and although still at a relatively early stage in their development, they are already being put to a range of uses in Japan, from making sushi, to passing Tokyo Universityâ€™s entrance examinations, The Register reported.
