For 50 years, Harry Redknapp has been one of football’s most colourful and outspoken characters. Now he’s written a book every fan will want to read.

In his new book 'A Man Walks On To a Pitch' - serialised exclusively by Sportsmail this week - Redknapp reveals the ways in which Arsene Wenger introduced new coaching techniques into the Premier League.

The arrival of Arsene Wenger in 1996 certainly heralded a change in English football. He was very successful very quickly, and suddenly all the talk was about his revolutionary new training methods.

He only trains for an hour… does everything on the stopwatch… the players are wearing heart monitors at training… he gives them supplements… Prozone is one of the biggest changes.

Last season, when QPR were due to play Blackpool, our most recent scout’s report had them operating with four at the back and two holding midfield players. In the old days, that would have been all that was available.

Now we’ve got machines that can call up game after game, personnel, the most detailed statistics, changes in the gameplan. So we knew that for most of the season they had played three centre-halves, and pushed the full-backs on and that would be how they intended to play if everyone was fit.

The aids for a manager are incredible now. When I began, we might have one report on the opposition. That aside, you just played - sorted your own team out and went from there.

If they had a player you fancied was good you might tell one of the lads to watch him, give him an idea of what to expect - but there was no detail. Don Revie at Leeds United was the only one who went into depth, and his dossiers were the talk of football.

Wenger used stop watches and other methods in order to ensure he got the maximum out of his players

Giggs would have solved England's problems... he was born to play left wing

Ravel Morrison has the class of Bale but his attitude is holding back his talent 

Vieira and Keane are warriors... they were even prepared to do battle while working on TV!

Why Redknapp fears that the English manager is in danger of becoming extinct  

Vieira nearly crossed North London to join Spurs... and  Suarez was close to signing too 

Pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players... the Premier League killed all that!

Other managers were still not convinced they were a good idea. Play your own game, that was the mantra. No managers changed their team to accommodate the opposition. Nobody mirrored formations.

These days, if the England manager is caught out tactically he gets slaughtered; but, even a few years before the Premier League, if the same man came in and said the other team were using wing-backs so he would go with a back three too, and flood midfield, he would have been called a coward. Why are we worrying about them? We’re England - let them worry about us!

I must admit, I find the point of Prozone baffling at times. Yes, you’ve got it - but so has the team you are playing. So while you’re watching them, they’re watching you, and while you’re changing to deal with them, they’re doing the same. We all go along with it, but where’s the edge?
