When a Virginia Tech student sent a request to a record label asking that the 1990s grunge- rock band Nirvana record a video message for the college's homecoming week, the student may have wanted to consult with Google before making the request.

Had the student - who only is identified as the school's mascot - done so, it would have become very clear that the request wasn't going to happen. The reason: the band split up nearly 20 years ago after its famous front-man, Kurt Cobain, committed suicide in 1994.Â 

Oops!

In the request, sent to the record label Sub Pop, the co-ed asks that the band record a video message saying, 'what's up Virginia Tech? This is Nirvana! Just wanted to wish you guys a
Happy Homecoming Week and good luck at the game this Saturday. LETS GO 
HOKIES!'

The student promises that if the band fulfills the request, the homecoming committee will 'include any links to downloads, Facebook pages, Twitter pages, and/or 
Artist Management Agencies' for the band.

The student goes on to add that if Nirvana would make the video, the band would be 'among artists that include Big N Rich, Ying Yang Twins, the 
Cataracs, Slightly Stoopid and three famous NFL Players.'

Presumably, those three unnamed NFL players currently are living.

Despite being apparently oblivious to the fact that one of the most famous rock stars of the last 25 years has been dead for nearly 20 of them, the student doesn't appear to realize the gender of the three members of the band.

'As Virginia Tech loves Nirvana, we'd love to have her in our video,' the student writes.

Nirvana, of course, was comprised of three men.

Confused by the embarrassingly outdated request, employees at Sub Pop decided to have a little fun.

Using Mark Arm, who played in the Nirvana contemporary band Mudhoney, as a stand-in for Cobain, they recorded a message for the school - but Arm doesn't cheer for the Hokies, he cheers for a sandwich.

'Let's go hoagies,' he and other employees yell at the end of the video.
