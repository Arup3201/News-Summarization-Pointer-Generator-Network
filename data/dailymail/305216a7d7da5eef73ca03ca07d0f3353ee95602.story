Harry Wentworth-Stanley is that type of male who has a peculiar effect on the opposite sex. Even the most reserved young ladies are provoked into throwing themselves at him.

The fact that he does nothing to encourage such attention (he seems almost bemused by it) simply spurs on the girls even more. 

He is absurdly handsome, ridiculously tall (6 ft 4 in), a brilliant sportsman — dashing on the polo field and an accomplished off-piste skier — clever, charming and well-read.

His background, too, is impeccable. His mother, Clare, is the Marchioness of Milford Haven, having acquired the title upon her second marriage to Harry’s stepfather, the Marquess of Milford Haven. His father is Nick Wentworth-Stanley, a debonair Old Etonian. Indeed, if Harry weren’t such a nice chap, it might seem unfair that he has been bestowed with so many advantages in life. 

For the eminently eligible Harry Wentworth-Stanley is ‘the other Harry’ — the Harry who was photographed holding hands with Cressida Bonas, Prince Harry’s former girlfriend, on Valentine’s night.

Cressida’s two-year romance with the Prince ended last April. Now, there is every indication she has moved on with another Harry. But all is not quite what it seems, for Cressida’s new man was actually on the romance scene first — and, as we will see, never really went away.

Cressida, who turned 26 last week, had a serious relationship with Harry Wentworth-Stanley when they were both students at Leeds University. The couple were known to their crowd — for reasons that aren’t entirely clear — as ‘Water-Cress’. Friends say she was heartbroken when he took off for a gap year to Argentina in 2011 after graduating, and the romance petered out.

Indeed, Cressida wasn’t quite over Harry when another Harry — Prince Harry himself — began pursuing her in the summer of 2012 and a romance began. There were concerts, rugby matches, skiing trips and cosy nights in at Kensington Palace. For a time, they were happy. If not forgotten, the other Harry was relegated to the back of her mind.

But just months into her new relationship, Harry Wentworth-Stanley returned from Argentina. It seems he was keen to pick up with Cressida exactly where he had left off.

According to a friend, he had been smitten by a girl in Buenos Aires, but it had come to nothing. Soon, there were reports Harry W-S was trying to win back Cressida while Prince Harry was on a tour of duty in Afghanistan. We don’t know whether that was correct or not, but the following summer, Cressida and Harry W-S were seen ‘flirting’ in a bar.

Cracks soon began to appear in Cressida’s romance with the Prince. Cressida, who enjoys the limelight to a degree (she’s a fledgling actress, after all) was disturbed to find herself photographed by strangers on their phones in the street. But she was keen on the Prince and wanted a serious relationship with a degree of commitment.

They split last April — the final straw for Cressida apparently being the Prince’s refusal to pay her £650 air fare to attend his friend Guy Pelly’s wedding in New York.

In the meantime, it seems the other Harry was playing a waiting game. Their recent date suggests a rekindling of the romance. ‘Cressida was dotty about Harry at university and, when he went off to Argentina, she was heartbroken,’ says a friend.

‘Then the antidote came along in the form of Prince Harry. Now that’s all over, it’s not surprising that she and Harry W-S are gravitating towards one another again.

‘They’ve stayed close since the split, and he has always been a threat to Prince Harry.’

It isn’t clear whether Harry and Cressida are officially an item yet, but appearances suggest they are. His admirers will be devastated. ‘Harry has girls swooning over him, but he is a level-headed young man and deals with it all with a grin and good grace,’ says the friend.

‘He has invitations pouring in night after night, but he avoids the limelight. He prefers weekends in country houses, riding, walking his dogs and swimming. Mr Wentworth-Stanley, 26, is not the idle trust-fund aristo of popular stereotype. He is training to become a surveyor with Savills and lives in a relatively modest flat in Notting Hill.

On the surface, he appears to have led a charmed life and, for most of his childhood, that was so.

He inherited his looks from his mother, Clare, a beauty who remains stunning at 54. There was a brother, James, four years his senior, and younger sister Louisa. When Harry was a child, his mother and father divorced. In 1997, Clare married George, Marquess of Milford Haven, a cousin of the Queen, himself divorced with two children.

The family settled at Great Trippetts, an estate set in 1,000 acres in the Sussex Downs. For a time, life was perfect. Clare stayed on good terms with her former husband, Nick Wentworth-Stanley, who went on to marry Dutch beauty Millie Brenninkmeyer, with whom he had three more children.

Shortly before Christmas 2006, the Marquess and Marchioness and their children went to stay with Nick and his wife in Worcestershire. James, Harry’s elder brother, was recovering from a relatively minor procedure. The operation was a success, but James had become very anxious in the days that followed.

One evening, the family were gathered in the house when they heard a shot fired. They rushed outside to find James lying dead.

The family was shattered by the tragedy.

Clare was floored by her son’s suicide. Touchingly, it was Harry, then 17, who helped her through it. She said in an interview 18 months after James’ death: ‘For the sake of the other children, you have to set an example. If you are strong, it gives them permission to be strong. If you fall to bits, they will.

‘The day after James died, his brother Harry said his biggest fear was that it would destroy me, and that would destroy everything else. It suddenly made me feel how important I was.’

Harry had to grow up quickly. ‘He was an absolute rock to his mother,’ says a friend. ‘After James died, he became much more grown-up.’

Prince Harry’s life, too, has been overshadowed by the tragic death of his mother, Diana, in the car crash in Paris in 1997.

But the two Harrys appear to have coped with the hand they have been dealt in different ways. While Harry Wentworth-Stanley has become mature and grounded, Prince Harry, at times, can seem like a lost soul.

Cressida, pictured in January this year, received favourable reviews for her appearance in the play There’s A Monster In The Lake, and was described as a ‘fantastic’ actress by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein

‘He’s a bit of a Peter Pan in a way,’ says another source. ‘He can’t quite grow up. He wants happiness and security, but when there’s a possibility of finding it, he sabotages it.’

What he thinks of reports of Cressida’s Valentine’s date isn’t clear. According to one friend, however, he sent Cressida a text wishing her a happy birthday. ‘They are still friends — there wasn’t a dramatic falling out,’ says the source.

According to the source, Cressida’s mother, four-times-married Lady Mary Gaye Curzon, was saddened when they split and had hoped there might be a reconciliation. Another of her daughters, Isabella Gough-Calthorpe, had a flirtation with Prince William when he split temporarily from Kate Middleton before their marriage.

She went on to marry Sam Branson, Sir Richard Branson’s son. ‘There is a sense that one of her girls slipped through the net, and she was keen for it not to happen with Cressida,’ says the source. ‘She adored the fact Cressida was Prince Harry’s girlfriend.’

Whether Prince Harry will now be spurred into trying to win back Cressida remains to be seen.

Since splitting from Prince Harry, Cressida’s profile has not dimmed. She received favourable reviews for her appearance in the play There’s A Monster In The Lake, and has a small part in forthcoming film Tulip Fever, which also stars Dame Judi Dench. Last month, movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, the film’s producer, described Cressida, as a ‘fantastic’ actress.

Asked about her relationship with Mr Wentworth-Stanley, Cressida’s representatives said ‘no comment’. Harry’s mother, Lady Milford Haven, said she ‘didn’t get involved in that area of Harry’s life and couldn’t comment’.

But it looks promising. ‘Harry was Cressida’s first real love and he has blossomed into a good-looking, fun-loving, but caring chap,’ says a friend. ‘He has all the right connections, without the royal blood and hang-ups.’

Both Harrys are undoubtedly a catch, but Mr Wentworth-Stanley looks like the best long-term bet.

And if it doesn’t work out with Cressida, he can be consoled that there is a long queue behind her.
