The mother of a six-year-old girl who was found raped and suffocated to death under a tarp in the street has called the neighbor suspected of committing the crime 'a time bomb' waiting to go off.

Laura Gallagher spoke out on Wednesday night for the first time since 17-year-old Tyler Holder was arrested for the murder of little Alanna Gallagher, who was found dead July 1.

The family also revealed they had alerted police to the teenager before, after he allegedly vandalized one of their cars.

Holder, who lived just two doors down from the Gallagher family, is in hospital in critical condition after an officer shot him in the head for opening fire on cops serving his arrest warrant. One of his bullets struck an officer in the groin.

Mrs Gallager became emotional as she spoke about the alleged killer who had been living just yards from her three young children in Saginaw, Texas.

Devastated: Laura Gallagher, whose daughter was found raped and suffocated to death under a tarp in the street, said she was horrified that a killer was roaming the streets so near to children

'Nobody thinks you're down the street from someone developing into a monster,' she told CBS-DFW. 'There's not just our kids, but so many other kids we'd see out playing.

'And you think of all the times that all these kids were walking past that house, and you feel like it was a time bomb slowly building that we didn't know about, and it went off on our baby.'

Her husband Karl added that he had contacted police about Holder in the past for allegedly vandalizing
one of their cars. He said that other cars in the neighborhood were 
targeted too.

Mrs Gallagher said she had not read the affidavit detailing Holder's alleged crimes because it is too graphic.

Heartbreaking: Her body was found under a tarp about a mile from her home hours after she went missing

The probable cause affidavit for the arrest, obtained by WFAA-TV, offers new details 
about the suffering inflicted upon Alanna, who was found under a tarp hours after she went missing.

The little girl, who was known for riding on her purple scooter in search of playmates, had been brutally raped, the affidavit shows.

Her partially clothed body was found by 14-year-old Owen 
Whiddon bound and wrapped in a 
grey tarpaulin in the middle of a street about a mile from her home 
later in the day of her disappearance.

Genetic
evidence was matched through DNA tests to a sample that Holder 
voluntarily provided to police earlier this month, the documents say.

His DNA was also found on the buckle of a belt used to wrap Alanna's body in the tarp.

Four Wal-Mart bags were taped over the girl’s head with red duct tape secured around her neck.

Her wrists and ankles were bound with the same tape and her body and clothes were wet with an unknown liquid.

Police later allegedly found what is believed to be the same kind of duct tape in 
rubbish bags outside the home Holder shared with his mother just two 
doors from where Alanna lived with her family.

Originally,
Saginaw Police had said they had no specific suspects, but the 
affidavit suggests Holder was under suspicion almost immediately.

Within
hours of Alanna’s body being found officers reported seeing Tyler 
Holder 'pacing up and down the sidewalk', the affidavit says.

Residents
allegedly informed police Holder had told them that it was Alanna’s body that had
been found, even before the authorities had revealed the identity of 
the victim.

Scene: On Tuesday, police and FBI agents investigate the scene where the officer and Holder were shot

Violence: A Saginaw police car blocks the entrance to Babbling Brook Dr. where the shootout took place

The next day, as officers searched the Gallagher home, Holder was seen standing across the street watching.

Holder
was questioned early in the investigation and told police on the day of
Alanna's death he woke up about 2pm, watched television and went to 
apply for jobs, having recently been made unemployed by Sonic.

The affidavit reads: 'Holder stated that he had no contact with Alanna Gallagher and that she had never been in his house,'

Holder also denied having a tarpaulin in his back garden.

But
video surveillance obtained from the north and south ends of Babbling 
Brook Drive allegedly  did not show Holder driving his vehicle that day as he had 
said.

On July 5, officers took a DNA sample from his mouth and were notified on Saturday it matched evidence found on Alanna's body, according to the affidavit.

At about 9am on Tuesday, officers arrived Holder's home in unmarked cars. Neighbours heard them pounding on the door shortly before multiple shots rang out.

Detective Charles Lodatto, who was Arlington's detective of the year in 2012, was shot in the groin, and the bullet severed his femoral artery before lodging in his hip.

Arlington Police Chief Will Johnson said he was recovering from his injuries, although he will need more surgeries and has a long road ahead of him.

The Gallagher family donated blood to help the injured officer, NBC-DFW reported.

Holder has now also been charged with attempted capital murder after opening fire and striking Detective Lodatto as officers served his arrest warrant on Monday.

He remains hospitalized at John Peter Smith Hospital under police guard. His bond is set at $500,000.

Classmates of Holder have described how the socially awkward teenager had a love of weapons, carried knives, and would crack sick jokes about rape.

Mikayla Dawson, 16, remembered him as an 'angry person' from Wayside Middle School.

She said: 'He was the kid that you were always 
really nice to because you didn’t know if he was going to come shoot up 
the school.'

Police have now confirmed neighbours have described Holder to them as a 'troublemaker' and that
he had been involved in 'criminal mischief' in the area.

Lauren Allen, 15, recalled a confrontation between her older brother and Holder a few years ago after a rare snowfall, when Holder destroyed a snowman her brother had built.

In retaliation, Lauren's brother threw a snowball at Holder, who 'just turned around and pulled out his pocket knife'.

Lauren added: 'He was weird and creepy, and he’s been violent in the past.'

Alanna's family claim they have been targeted in the aftermath of the horrific incident.

Alanna lived with her siblings, their 
parents Laura and Karl Gallagher, and a second male, Miles McDaniel, who
was in a polyamorous relationship with her parents.

Police
have said that the Gallaghers and McDaniel were home while Alanna 
played outside alone. They are not sure when she was abducted from the 
neighborhood.

Although her body was discovered at about 7.30pm, her father did not report her missing until two hours later.

Last week, a memorial set up for the 
little girl outside her home was set on fire along with the family's car.
