Prince George is having a great time at swimming lessons, the Duchess of Cambridge said today.

Kate told former world and Commonwealth champion swimmer James Hickman that her young son was already a fan of the water - and enjoys 'grabbing things to splash with'.

Mr Hickman, 38, asked her if she had taken the Prince, who celebrated his first birthday recently, swimming yet.

The sportsman, from Manchester, later said: 'She was at the swimming last night, so I was just interested to know if she had taken George swimming.

‘Hopefully if they can get him swimming he could be a future international swimmer. She’s been swimming with him.

‘She said he loves the water and he grabs things to splash with. So, maybe he could be the next royal to take part in the Olympics, and if he was in swimming that would be incredible.'

The Mail revealed last Saturday how George was enjoying weekly swimming lessons with his mother, the Duchess of Cambridge, in the historic pool at Buckingham Palace.

On his first birthday last week, George was seen being driven into Buckingham Palace by his mother, accompanied by his nanny Maria Borallo and a police protection officer, on what was believed to be a visit to his grandparents. In fact, he was off to enjoy his weekly splash-about.

The pool, which is situated at the rear of the palace, was converted from a conservatory in 1938 and has been used by generations of royal children, including Prince Charles and his siblings, Andrew, Edward and Anne.

More recently, George’s late grandmother, Diana, Princess of Wales, visited each week as part of her fitness regime, as well as using it to teach her sons William and Harry how to swim.

Now George is continuing the family tradition with regular dips with his mother when the family are in London. A source said: ‘The Duchess brings him up to the palace every week now.’

At a recent event to highlight his new
 presidency of the British Sub-Aqua Club, Prince William told how George
 loves splashing around and that bath-time has become ‘quite painful’.

His
 own father Prince Charles also revealed he instilled a love of water in
 his son from an early age. ‘I threw him in the swimming pool on 
occasions. Instead of putting him off, it enthused him,’ he said.

'She said he loves the water and he grabs things to splash with. So, maybe he could be the next royal to take part in the Olympics, and if he was in swimming that would be incredible'

James Hickman, former swimmer

Former swimmer Mr
 Hickman had chatted to Kate at a reception hosted by the charity SportsAid,
 which gives financial support to the talented young athletes to help 
them reach the top and compete internationally.

The
 Duchess is the charity’s patron and its newest ambassador is tennis 
star Laura Robson, who was also at this morning’s reception hosting a 
mentoring session for young sportswomen.

More
 than 450 of the home nations athletes competing at Glasgow 2014 have 
received support from SportsAid, including Bradley Wiggins for Team 
England, Daniel Keatings for Team Scotland, Michael Conlan for Team 
Northern Ireland and Geraint Thomas for Team Wales.

Miss Robson said she was 'so happy' to be involved with SportsAid after it was announced yesterday she was their latest ambassador.

The tennis player added that Kate’s involvement had been a 'massive help' in boosting awareness of the charity’s work.

She said: 'To have someone as high 
profile as the Duchess being part of the organisation makes a massive 
difference. She really wants to get involved, it’s so good to have her 
on board.'

Fifteen-year-old 
swimmer Tom Hamer, who won silver for England in the Commonwealth Games 
Para-sport S14 200 metres freestyle, told how meeting the Duchess was 
more nerve-racking than competing in the final.

He said: 'I was more nervous meeting the Duchess, meeting the royal family is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.'

Kate also watched rower Joshua Armstrong, 16, from Hamilton, being put through his paces on a rowing machine. He said: 'She was asked if she wanted to have a go, but she said she couldn’t because of her skirt.'

He added: 'I was more nervous meeting her than I was when I was competing in the British championships, but when I started talking to her she was really nice.'

While Kate was at the SportsAid reception, the Duke of Cambridge and his brother Prince Harry met young coaches at a training project in Glasgow.
