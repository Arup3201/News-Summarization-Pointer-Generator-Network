Full household: Seventeen years ago the McCaughey children grabbed headlines for being the first world's first set of surviving septuplets.

Dinner times: Now, all grown-up, high school juniors Kenny, Kelsey, Natalie, Brandon, Alexis, Nathan and Joel are gearing up to leave the family home in Des Moines, Iowa, and go solo

In an episode of Oprah: Where Are They Now? airing on Sunday night their parents talked about what it was like raising such a large brood.

Meals are served buffet style and 15 to 17 loads of laundry get done per week.

Family matriarch, Bobbi, 46, said that food shopping remains one of the biggest struggles and she buys everything in bulk in a bid to cut costs.

She recently snapped up 60lbs of hamburgers after spotting them on sale at a local grocery store and she grows fresh produce in the garden. 

Happy and healthy: Natalie, left in hospital and right today, is a promising student and hopes to teach

Strong: Brandon, pictured left and right, enjoys wrestling and hopes to join the military after graduating

Tiny: Kelsey was the lightest baby at 2lb 5oz but she now enjoys soccer and wants a career in cosmetology

Hard workers: Kenny, left, also enjoys wrestling at school, woodworking, fishing and playing the drums

Fighter: Alexis, who suffers from cerebral palsy, is in cheerleading as a manager and hopes to teach

Impressive: Nathan, who also has cerebral palsy, hopes for a career in science after school

Last but not least: Joel was the 8th to be born, weighing just 2lbs 15oz. He now runs track and plays trombone

'We plant a lot of tomatoes because we use a lot of tomatoes. Beans are what's in season right now,' the mother-of-eight said while giving a tour of her allotment.

Bobbi and her husband Kenny, who already had one daughter, famously declined selective reduction after learning they were pregnant with seven children following fertility treatment, saying it was 'in God's hands'.

'I will always remember the day we found out there were so many,' Bobbi previously told the Des Moines Register. 

'It wasn't like "yoohoo!" There were so many doubts. To a lot of people this might sound trite, but God determined the outcome.'

Learning they had septuplets on the way sparked international headlines that would chart the children's every move.

After the babies were born nine weeks prematurely in Des Moines on November 19 1997, joining their big sister, Mikayla Marie, news crews swarmed their modest one-floor home.

Amid the media frenzy, President Bill Clinton personally called the family to congratulate the family, Oprah welcomed them on her show and companies and strangers scrambled to help out the couple.

Among the donations, they received a 5,500 square foot home, a van, a year's worth of Kraft's macaroni and cheese, diapers for the first two years and full college scholarships for any state university in Iowa.

During the early months, the septuplets drank 42 bottles a day and went through 52 diapers.

But over the years, the media coverage has waned and the coupons for free food have run out - encouraging the family to be frugal.

These days, the family spends at least $300 a month on groceries, shopping at food warehouses.

And from their early teenage years, the septuplets have been helping out the family by carrying out chores, such as their own laundry.

The family still lives in the same house that was donated after the births and continues to use the same van.

And while the four boys and three girls are now of driving age, their father, who still works at a metal coating plant, warned that they can only have cars once they get jobs.

'If they want to drive, then they have to save up and buy their own car,' Kenny said, adding that ''they're getting there.'

He is also up against other teenage challenges.

'The biggest challenge is making sure they keep up with certain things but not keep up with certain things, trendy things,' Kenny said of his teenagers. 'Three of them have cellphones and a couple have iPads.'

The family has saved to cover braces for several of the children and the medical needs of Alexis and Nathan, who were born with forms of cerebral palsy.

Both of the children had surgeries, including a spinal surgery to help Nathan walk, over the years but they are doing well, the Des Moines Register reported.

Alexis has also started taking part in beauty pageants for special needs children, taking the 2013 Teen Miss Dreams Made True award in Carroll.

'It feels really awesome,' Alexis told the Carrolls Paper at the time. 'I love just interacting with all the girls because they're really nice.'

Amid the life lessons and support from their parents, the teens are also battling classes at school.

In 2012 they began high school and have become fully immersed in activities; all are part of the band and perform at halftime at football games.

Five have run cross country, another wrestles, one plays soccer and another enters speech contests, while six were on the honor roll, the Register reported.

'It's fun to see the work pay off,' Bobbi said of her children.

As their lives have become busier, they have fallen from television screens and magazines - from Time magazine to Dateline NBC - that they regularly graced throughout their childhoods.

While Bobbi said she missed the media, the children are less bothered.

'It was kinda cool but in other ways I never liked it, all these cameras following you around everywhere,' Nathan said.

With high school graduation on the horizon, the McCaughey teens will soon go their separate ways.

Their father Kenny concluded: 'The kids are getting better at doing their own thing. It's just the gradual road to individual living.'
