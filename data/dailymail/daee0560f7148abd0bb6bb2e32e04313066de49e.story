Southampton forward Lee Barnard told 
tenants living in his 14-bedroom townhouse he would cut their gas and 
electricity cut if they did not leave the property within two weeks.

The 28-year-old, who is due to marry 
Playboy model Tonya French today, bought the property in Chelmsford, 
Essex recently and wrote to the 11 residents telling to leave because he
wanted to renovate the townhouse.

Barnard, a former Tottenham player, 
offered tenants a £100 'incentive', some of whom were people on housing 
and disability benefits, to move out quickly.

The tenants, who have individual flats in the large detached house, should legally have been given two months to quit.

Sandra
Keeble, who has been living in the property for five years, said: 'We 
are being completely bullied. I think it is abhorrent and horrible.

'We were told to get out with our belongings but there was no chance of us finding the money within two weeks.

'Nobody
has a way to contact the new owner - we tried the number at the bottom 
of the letters but it goes straight to voicemail and no-one replies to 
the e-mails we have sent.'

A charity which helps people who have been made homeless has been helping the families look for new accommodation.

Ray Ellis, 52, is on disability benefits and was shocked by the demand to leave so suddenly.

He said: 'I have asked for more time to find somewhere else to go - we are not finding it easy to find an alternative.'

Three of the residents have moved out since the demands were made last month.

Officials from Chelmsford Borough Council have told the residents they are legally allowed to stay.

Barnard, who spent the second half of the season at League One Oldham on loan, blamed the situation on a 'mix up' and said he had been cooperative throughout.

'We wrote to the tenants when we found out that the notice period was not long enough,' he said last night.

'We were happy to extent the notice period and have been in regular contact with the council as well.

'I have not been trying to bully the tenants - I bought the property, I think it is quite run-down and needs a lot of work and I am within my rights to serve the notice period and that is now a sufficient one.  

'It's just a misunderstanding with the handover from the previous owner who said we only had to give them notice of a day, so with the rent-free period and £100 we felt it was a good offer.

'The council are fully aware of the situation and are happy with the arrangements - the first letters were just sent out with the wrong date.'

A Chelmsford City Council spokesman said: 'I confirm tenants did contact us and they were advised they have been served an illegal notice and that they don't have to leave by June 1.

'We informed them of their rights and offered our help and support in finding new housing when the tenancy ends.

'The new owner has been advised of their legal obligations and the new owners have been completely compliant and are now following the correct legal process.'
