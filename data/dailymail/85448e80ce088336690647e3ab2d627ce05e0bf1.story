A woman whose body was discovered alongside that of her husband after a fire was started in her home was stabbed to death, it has emerged.

Mahnaz Rafie died from multiple stab wounds before the gas supply in the house's kitchen was tampered with to start a blaze, detectives found.

The 48-year-old's mother, Dolleh Joseph, and husband, Hassan Rafie, died in the fire that police have been treating as a possible case of murder-suicide.

Investigation: Detectives were investigating whether the incident had been a case of murder suicide

Scene: Firefighters arrived at the house at about 2am on December 10 and found two bodies, believed to be Hassan Rafie and his wife Mahnaz, in the kitchen

Emergency services were called to the 
house in Heaton, Bolton at about 2am on December 9 after neighbours reported 
hearing an explosion before seeing the property fill with smoke.

The
 bodies of Mrs Rafie and her husband,who would have celebrated their 
25th wedding anniversary next week, were found in the kitchen.

Mrs Rafie's 74-year-old mother was rescued from an upstairs bedroom but died later in hospital from smoke inhalation and burns.

Police are not looking for anyone in connection with the case which has been referred to the Bolton Coroner.

Inquiries: Fire officials have said the investigation at the scene would last for several days

Suspicious: Police have described the fire, which was thought to have started in the kitchen, as suspicious

A statement on behalf of their two sons said: 'We are deeply saddened and heartbroken by the tragic loss of our family.

'Our
 parents would next week have been celebrating 25 years of marriage 
through which they worked together through the greatest difficulties to 
build a successful life from scratch.

'They were loved by all that knew them.

'Our
 father, a successful architect and businessman, was extremely respected
 in the community, he took many people under his wings and took the 
world's problems on his shoulders.

'Our mother, our best friend, our angel, was an extremely strong lady who was deeply and sincerely loved by all.'

Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.

The couple's home had been on the market for some time before the fire, it has been revealed.

Reports suggest their relationship had recently become strained and Mrs Rafie, 48, had threatened to leave.

Neighbours said the Rafie family, thought to be of Iranian origin, have lived in the house for about ten years.

It is thought Mrs Rafieâ€™s mother, from London, was staying with the couple after being diagnosed with cancer.

The couple have two sons Ommid, a newly qualified doctor, and Arash who is currently a medical student.
