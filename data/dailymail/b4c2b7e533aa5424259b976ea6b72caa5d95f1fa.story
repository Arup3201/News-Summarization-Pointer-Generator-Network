His ruggedly handsome looks helped him win roles in dozens of films including Sunday in New York and The Train Robbers. He also voiced the character of Pongo in 101 Dalmatians.

Taylor’s final role was in Inglourious Basterds, Quentin Tarantino’s 2009 film in which he played Winston Churchill.

In Alfred Hitchcock’s 1963 film The Birds, he helped co-star Tippi Hedren battle swarms of vicious birds that were attacking a Californian coastal town.

Miss Hedren paid tribute to Taylor, saying in a statement: ‘There are so many incredible feelings I have for him. Rod was a great pal to me and a real strength.’

He is survived by his wife of 34 years, Carol Kikumura, and daughter Felicia, from his second marriage to Mary Hilem.
