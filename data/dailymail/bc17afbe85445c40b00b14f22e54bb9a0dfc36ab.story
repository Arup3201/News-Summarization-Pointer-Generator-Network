Manuel Pellegrini looks likely to continue as Manchester City manager, in part due to the lack of suitable candidates to replace him this summer.

Serious questions are being asked of Pellegrini after another chastening defeat by Barcelona in the Champions League and what has so far been a weak defence of the Premier League title.

But although there is deep concern at the Etihad about City’s lack of progress this season, it is understood there are no plans to sack him at the end of the campaign. However, Pellegrini’s position would be untenable if his team finish outside the top four.

The club are already working on summer transfer targets identified by the Chilean - primarily Paul Pogba

The club are already working on summer transfer targets identified by the Chilean — primarily Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba — and the feeling is that he will survive into the final year of his three-year contract as City wait for No 1 target Pep Guardiola to end his spell at Bayern Munich.

Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone and Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti have been touted as possible replacements, though Simeone is not liked by the City board, while Ancelotti’s links with the club are, according to sources, the result of allies putting his name forward as he looks to find a way out of an increasingly unhappy spell at Real Madrid.

Guardiola talks regularly with City chief executive Ferran Soriano and football director Txiki Begiristain, though any switch is unlikely until 2016 when the Spaniard’s contract expires. 

City, meanwhile, could lose highly-rated head of youth Patrick Vieira. The ex-Arsenal star is out of contract in the summer and no talks about an extension have taken place.
