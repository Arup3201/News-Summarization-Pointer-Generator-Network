The daughter of a Navy vet killed by an Ohio drunk driver says her father’s confessed killer was just trying to avoid a harsh jail sentence by confessing in a YouTube video that has since gone viral.

Angela Canzani believes Matthew Cordle, who says he hit and killed Vincent Canzani, 61, on June 22 in, was ‘totally misleading’ with his confession because he was already suspected of the crime.

The accusation comes just a day after Canzani’s own ex-wife applauded Cordle’s decision to confess, calling him an ‘honest man.’

SCROLL DOWN FOR THE VIDEO

Video confession: The 3.5 minute video starts out with his face blurred and voice altered as he explains how he was driving drunk when he killed someone

Moment of truth: Matthew Cordle identifies himself when the effects are taken away and says that he will plead guilty to any charges that he faces stemming from the June 22 accident

‘There was a traffic cam. There was a 
third car involved,’ Canzani told NBC News. ‘So people are kind of 
looking at this like he’s just coming out of nowhere…Like he’s some hero
or something.’

A hero is exactly how Canzani says her father’s confessed killer is hoping to appear.

Cordle
has not yet been charged, but likely will be charged with aggravated 
vehicular homicide with an alcohol specification, which carries a 
maximum of eight years in prison upon conviction.

‘It’s
making it look like he’s confessing to a crime,’ Canzani said of 
Cordle’s video, which was released this week to promote a not-for-profit
web start up called 'Because I Said I Would' which promotes the use of 
'promise cards' where individuals set goals for themselves.

Though Cordle has received widespread praise since his confession hit YouTube, Canzani remain dubious.

Victim: Vincent Canzani was 61 at the time of his death (pictured recently at right) and previously served in the Navy (seen in his uniform in an undated photo at left)

‘If
he wanted to raise awareness, I mean, I would’ve commended him for that
down the road, but the video is totally misleading. The motives, I 
believe, are so he’ll get a lighter sentence.

‘There’s a way to go about it and that wasn’t it.’

On Friday, the
ex-wife of Mr Canzini told MailOnline she 'applauded' the decision of 
Cordle - who now faces criminal charges brought by the county prosecutor.

Cordle
says in the video he 'made a mistake' when he decided to drive his 
truck home after 'drinking heavily' and hit the other car, killing Mr 
Canzani, of suburban Columbus.

The
video begins with Cordle's face blurred as he describes how he has 
struggled with depression and was simply trying to have a good time with
friends going 'from bar to bar' the night of the accident.

Cordle's face becomes clear as he reveals his name and confesses to killing Mr Canzani.

'When
I get charged I'll plead guilty and take full responsibility for 
everything I've done to Vincent and his family,' Cordle says.

Later,
he says he understands that by releasing the video he's giving 
prosecutors 'everything they need to put me away for a very long time.'

The
video was released in connection to a start-up called Because I Said I 
Would, a non-profit aimed at encouraging individuals to stay true to 
their personal commitments.

Since leaving the Navy, he flourished 
as 'a gifted photographer' and was survived by two daughters and three 
great grandchildren.

Today,
Cheryl Olcott, who was married to Mr Canzani for 10 years, said that 
she is praying for him - and even forgave him for not coming forward for
two months.

Mrs Olcott, 
said: 'I applaud Matt for stepping up to the plate. He's taken full 
responsibility. He is an honest man who has spoken the truth. It's 
unfortunate that the whole cycle of events has happened this way. I pray
for Matthew Cordle.'

Asked if she would have preferred it if Cordle had admitted his guilt right away, she said: 'You can't change what's happened, that's all I know. I'm not a judge. There's only one judge and that's the big guy upstairs. Matthew is a good man. I commend him for that'.

Mrs Oclott, who love in Norwalk, Ohio, said she'd followed the case closely and remembered their time together fondly. 'There were a lot of good times,' she said.

Problems: The county prosecutor said that Matthew Cordle was considered a suspect in the case but had not been charged. In light of the video, he will presumably be charged with aggravated vehicular homicide

She added Mr Canzani was an only child whose parents have died and said that he was estranged from his two grown-up daughters.

She said: 'He had no-one. He hasn't spoken with his daughters his whole life. He didn't raise them.'

Franklin County prosecutor Ron O'Brien on Thursday said Cordle was a suspect in the deadly crash but hadn't been charged.

O'Brien said he saw the video on Wednesday and will ask a grand jury to indict Cordle for aggravated vehicular homicide.

O'Brien said Cordle's blood sample from the night of the crash tested positive for alcohol and negative for drugs.

In the video, Cordle says that at the time of the accident he consulted with some ‘high-powered attorneys who told me similar cases where the drivers got off.’

‘They were convinced that they could get my blood test thrown out and all I would have to do for that was lie,’ he said.

His pledge: Cordle, 22, said that he was fully aware of the legal implications of making the video

Defense attorney George Breitmayer III said the video 'is a strong testament' to Cordle's character. He said Cordle intends to co-operate with prosecutors.

Police in June said Canzani, of Gahanna, died at the scene after his Jeep was struck on Interstate 670.

Cordle ends the video confession by 'begging' viewers to not drink and drive.

'I can't bring Mr Canzani back, and I can't erase what I've done, but you can still be saved. Your victims can still be saved,’ he said.

The video was released in conjunction with a not-for-profit start up called Because I Said I Would, which is focused around having individuals make commitments to themselves and their goals using index cards.

Its website says that it aims to become a 'a social movement dedicated to bettering humanity through the power of a promise'.

The organization was founded by Alex Sheen who was inspired by his father, who died of lung cancer last September. At his father's funeral, they handed out promise cards in tribute to how his father always kept his promises.

In a message that was posted on the group's website when the confession video was published, Mr Sheen says that Mr Cordle was the one to reach out to him via Facebook message about the hit-and-run.

'After getting to know Matt, I can say with confidence that he truly regrets his decision that night. He describes the guilt he has as “insurmountable,”' Mr Sheen wrote in the post.

'Against all legal advice, Matthew decided to make this video and release it prior to any charges being filed against him. His goal is to raise awareness about the terrible consequences that drunk driving can have on innocent people.'

Cordle's confession is not the only high-profile action the group has been involved with. 

After the three young women were 
discovered in Ariel Castro's Cleveland home, Mr Sheen was moved to 
launch a ten-day walking campaign across the state in their honor.

Movement: The group's founder, Alex Sheen (seen closest to the camera) was inspired to go on a 10-day state-wide walk to raise awareness for sexual abuse victims after DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight were found

Big finish: He ended the walk by being greeted by Gina DeJesus' mother at the site of the 'House of Horrors', which is just six miles away from where Sheen lives

He said that he lives six miles away from the now-razed 'House of Horrors' and was moved by the girls' perseverance.

He used the walk as a way to raise awareness about sexual assault, and at the end, he was greeted by Gina DeJesus' mother.

Mr Sheen gave her a number of t-shirts with the organization's name printed on them, and in return, she later sent him a picture of Gina wearing the shirt.
