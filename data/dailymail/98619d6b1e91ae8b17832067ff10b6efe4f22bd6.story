Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is joining private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC.

The firm announced Saturday that Geithner will serve as president and managing director of the firm starting March 1, 2014.

Geithner played a central role in devising the U.S. government's response to the financial crisis of 2008-2009.

Few Treasury secretaries received as much scrutiny. Supporters credited Geithner with helping prevent the recession from spiraling into a second Great Depression, but critics said he was too cozy with Wall Street.

Geithner was widely associated with the TARP bank rescue, which was ushered through Congress by former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and then managed by Geithner after the Bush-Obama transition.

The controversial TARP was seen by some as a bailout of fat cat bankers. And some credited it with stabilizing the economy and helping avoid a deeper recession.

When the crisis began, Geithner was president of the New York Federal Reserve, which helps oversee Wall Street. All told, he ran the New York Fed from 2003 until 2009.

Geithner stepped down from Treasury in late January, days after President Barack Obama was sworn in for a second term, and signed a deal with Random House's Crown Publishers to write a behind-the-scenes book about the response to the economic crisis.

The last of Obama's original economic advisers to leave the administration, he was succeeded as Treasury secretary by Jack Lew.

Mr. Geithner has long considered a career in investing once his days in Washington ended. He has been reluctant to take a job with any banks, which he once regulated, and views private-equity firms and other investment managers as different from the institutions he oversaw as New York Fed chief.

He had been weighing job options while writing an account of the financial crisis, due out next year.

Since leaving public service, Geithner had been traveling on the speaking circuit and speaking at corporate events.

Indeed, Mr. Geithner initially seemed unlikely to join Wall Street. While he garnered praise for helping to arrest the financial crisis from worsening, critics repeatedly assailed his policies during the Obama administration as too friendly to the nationâ€™s mega-banks.

One longstanding criticism is that he made permanent the idea that 'too big to fail' institutions would be bailed out if they ran into trouble.

Now he will be joining Warburg Pincus, a 47-year-old private equity firm that oversees $35 billion in assets. Unlike rivals like the Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the firm has stayed privately held and low-profile.

Still, its investments have included buying control of the eye-care company Bausch & Lomb and the luxury retailer Neiman Marcus. Both were sold in multibillion-dollar deals earlier this year.
