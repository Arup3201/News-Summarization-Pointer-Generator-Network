The four police officers involved in the fatal pursuit of Brazilian student Roberto Curti in Sydney's CBD are seeking to permanently halt criminal proceedings against them.

Mr Curti died in the early hours of March 18, 2012, following a chase and violent struggle with police in which he was Tasered, handcuffed, hit with capsicum spray and knelt on.

Police officers Scott James Edmondson, Chin Aun Lim, Daniel David Barling and Damian John Ralph have since been charged over the alleged assault on Mr Curti.

All four have pleaded not guilty.

In a hearing on Monday, Barrister Bret Walker SC told Downing Centre Local Court they were now making an application to stay the proceedings against them.

The prosecution case against the four had been tainted by directed interviews which took place in the days after Mr Curti's death, Mr Walker said.

During the interviews, officers were 'compelled' to answer questions by threat of disciplinary action and therefore their answers should not have been used against them.

Instead, Mr Walker argued, the interviews became 'inextricably entangled' in the ensuing investigation of them.

This meant the prosecution case was 'rooted in an eradicable error', he said.

But Crown Advocate Natalie Adams SC, appearing on behalf of the attorney-general, said only three pages of Lim's interview had ever been handed to the DPP.

If the admissibility of the interviews was in question, Ms Adams said there should be an application for that evidence to be excluded.

'This is not a basis for a stay,' she said, adding that should be a 'last resort'.

Magistrate Mark Buscombe will hand down his decision on the permanent stay application by the four police officers on November 11.
