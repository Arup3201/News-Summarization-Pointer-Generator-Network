A GP is being investigated amid claims he failed to diagnose a two-year-old with leukaemia and dismissed her symptoms as ‘toddler bruising’.

Sarah Sargent, 31, took her daughter, Lacey, to the doctor when worrying bruises began appearing on her body.

She claims Dr David Pelta didn’t even get out of his chair during the brief 30 second check-up at Queensway Surgery in Southend, Essex.

Lacey Sargent was diagnosed with leukaemia after developing bruising. But, when her mother first took her to the GP, she was sent away and told she had 'toddler bruising' She is pictured before her illness

She said he glanced over his desk, said it was ‘toddler bruising’ and there was nothing he could do and then sent them home.

Two days later, Lacey’s condition worsened and Mrs Sargent and her husband Stuart, 30, took their daughter back to see another GP at the surgery.

This time, Dr Michael Jack immediately referred Lacey to Southend Hospital where she was diagnosed with leukaemia.

In the seven months since, Lacey has had numerous blood transfusions and painful bone marrow tests and been forced to take chemotherapy tablets at home.

But the family have finally had some good news after being told the treatment is working.

It means Lacey has just one month left of taking medication before she is slowly weaned off the chemotherapy.

Lacey's mother, Sarah, says Dr David Pelta just spent 30 seconds with her and that he did not check her over

NHS England IS investigating Dr Pelta who has voluntarily left the practice pending their report.

Mrs Sargent, of Southend, Essex, said the GP should be permanently struck off.

The mother-of-three said: ‘I took Lacey to see him and he didn’t even get out of his chair. He just peered over the table and said “it’s just toddler bruising”.

‘I just thought “I’m not a doctor, I don’t know” so I left and made another appointment for blood tests in two weeks’ time.

‘The second doctor examined her four times and immediately admitted her to hospital. He knew what was wrong but didn’t want to say.

After months of chemotherapy, Lacey is now responding well to treatment and will soon be weaned off medication

‘When we found out it was awful. You just don’t expect any of your children to come down with leukaemia.’

She added: ‘It has been horrible but she has been happy the whole way through and I’m so proud of her.

‘There is always a chance that it can come back which is extremely scary. I don’t think I could go through it again.

‘Now we want Dr Pelta struck off. We want to protect other families. You have to do your job properly and he didn’t.’

Mrs Sargent says she spoke about her concerns to a pharmacist before seeing Dr Pelta in August last year and they told her Lacey should have a blood test.

Dr Pelta is also being investigated by the General Medical Council over separate allegations.

He has been placed under a series of restrictions since November last year after concerns over his medical notes.

He is one of four doctors who saw a 20-year-old before she died from heart failure.

Jodie Fields’ family have refused to accept an inquest ruling that she died from Sudden Adult Death Syndrome and say her symptoms should have been picked up sooner.

A GMC spokeswoman said: ‘I can confirm that the GMC is investigating.

‘Dr Pelta has restrictions on his practice while the investigation is on-going. They were imposed on October 17.’

In a statement released by the Medical Protection Society, Dr Pelta, of Westcliff, Essex, said: ‘While matters are being investigated, I voluntarily agreed not to attend the practice.

‘I cannot comment while there is an investigation taking place.’

Ian Stidston, director of commissioning for NHS England Essex, said he couldn’t comment on individual cases.

Fatigue and pale skin - this is because leukaemia can cause anaemia which makes a child feel weak, tired and light-headed.

Infections and fever - children with leukaemia lack normal white blood cells which would normally help fight infection.

Easy bruising or bleeding - this includes frequent nosebleeds, bleeding gums and bleeding a lot from small cuts.

Bone or joint pain - this is caused by a build up of leukaemia cells near the surface of the bone or inside the joint.

Swelling of the abdomen - leukaemia cells may collect in the liver and spleen causing them to enlarge.

Loss of appetite and weight loss - if the spleen and liver swell, they can press against the stomach causing loss of appetite.

Swollen lymph nodes - some leukaemias spread to the lymph nodes causing them to swell.
