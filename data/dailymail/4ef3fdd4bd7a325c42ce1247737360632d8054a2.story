While it may not come as a surprise to most, patriots are outraged to learn more young Australians are able to sing the words to Daft Punk's Get Lucky chorus than both verses of Advance Australia Fair.

More than 1,000 people aged 18 to 29 took part in a survey, which found 84 per cent knew all the words to the chorus of the French duo's mega hit.

But in contrast and sparking the ire of patriots, just 71 per cent of the young people surveyed knew all the words of the national anthem's second verse.

A study has found more young Australians are able to sing the words to Daft Punk's Get Lucky chorus than the whole national anthem

While 84 per cent of young people know the words of the Get Lucky chorus, by Daft Punk, pictured left, media personality Sam Kekovich, pictured right, said it was imperative the national anthem was sung at school, with the study finding just 71 per cent of young people know the words to the anthem's second verse

Get Lucky features U.S. singer Pharrell Williams on vocals and was one of the biggest singles of 2013 internationally and went on to win Record of the Year at the Grammy Awards last year while the online survey by Jack Daniel's focused on the music industry.

Media personality and former Australian rules football player Sam Kekovich said he was not shocked by the finding of the survey, reported the Herald Sun.

'Australia needs to come front and square. It’s imperative we sing the national anthem at schools,” Mr Kekovich said.

'We need to remind young people what the national anthem is about and remembering the sacrifices that Australians have made.'

Former NSW premier Morris Iemma stated a lack of respect was behind the 2005 Cronulla riots and it was important students were taught Australian values such as respect and responsibility.

On the back of this, Mr Iemma announced a plan to make it compulsory for the national anthem to be sung a school assemblies, reported the Sydney Morning Herald. 

The announcement was met with criticism by the NSW Teachers Federation at the time, as most schools already sang the anthem.

Advance Australia Fair was written by Peter Doffs McCormick, who was born in Scotland and arrived in Sydney in 1855.

Before it became Australia's national anthem, Advance Australia Fair was first performed in 1878.

It was not until 1977 that today's national anthem replaced God Save the Queen, beating out other alternatives including Waltzing Matilda in a plebiscite as part of a referendum on a range of issues.
