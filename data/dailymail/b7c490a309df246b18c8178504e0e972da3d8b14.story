The activities of a Chinese IT company are to be probed by security chiefs amid fears of links to cyber-espionage.

Telecoms giant Huawei, which was founded by a former Red Army officer, is a major provider of phone and broad technology in Britain following a multi-billion pound deal with BT in 2005.

But last month an influential committee of MPs raised concerns the equipment could be used by Beijing to spy in the UK.

The company denies both spying and links to the Chinese State and military.

Concerns over a lack of safeguards led to the creation in 2010 of a Cyber Security centre in Oxfordshire known as The Cell - to check and approve Huawei equipment.

But MPs on the Intelligence and Security committee criticised the ‘self-policing’ arrangements after they discovered staff at the centre were employed by the company and not by GCHQ, the government’s listening centre.

Their report said China could ‘intercept covertly or disrupt traffic passing through Huawei-supplied networks’,  adding that oversight of the firm in the UK is ‘feeble’ and suffers from the ‘absence of any strategy’.

Yesterday the Cabinet Office announced a review of the site would be carried out by the national security adviser, Sir Kim Darroch.

He will report to David Cameron later this year.

It will consider whether GCHQ should play a bigger role in the centre’s management or even supply all of its employees.

A Cabinet Office spokesman said it took threats to Critical National Infrastructure very seriously.

But he added: ‘However, we are not complacent and as such we have agreed to the main recommendation of the report to conduct a review of Huawei’s Cyber Security Evaluation Centre to give assurance that we have the right measures and processes in place to protect UK telecommunications.’

Huawei welcomed the review, but defended security arrangements at the site, pointing out that all staff had high level security clearance.

A spokesman said: ‘Huawei shares the same goal as the UK government and the ISC in raising the standards of cyber security in the UK and ensuring that network technology benefits UK consumers.’

The company’s technology is contained within the green boxes on British streets which link households to the national phone network.

Last year a committee of US politicians urged American firms to stop doing business with the company. warning that China could use equipment made by the companies to spy and threaten vital national communications systems.
