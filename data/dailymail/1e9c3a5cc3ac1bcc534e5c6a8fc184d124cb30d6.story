Roger Clemens will face a brand new court battle later this year over charges he lied to Congress about using performance enhancing drugs after an abrupt mistrial was called on Thursday.

The judge declared a mistrial in the baseball star's perjury trial after prosecutors showed jurors evidence the judge had ruled out of bounds.

U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton said the prosecutors made a grave mistake and Clemens could not be assured of a fair trial after jurors were shown the evidence in the second day of testimony.

Former Major League baseball pitcher Roger Clemens refused to comment to the media after a mistrial was called in a federal court in Washington

Walton scheduled a September 2 hearing to determine whether to hold a new trial.

He told jurors he was sorry to have wasted their time and spent so much taxpayer money, only to call off the case.

'There are rules that we play by and those rules are designed to make sure both sides receive a fair trial, ' Walton told the jury, saying such ground rules are critically important when a person's liberty is at stake.

 'If this man got convicted, he would go to jail, ' Walton said.

He said that because prosecutors broke his rules, 'the ability with Mr. Clemens with this jury to get a fair trial with this jury would be very difficult if not impossible. '

Prosecutors suggested the problem could be fixed with an instruction to the jury to disregard the evidence, but Walton seemed skeptical.

He said he could never know what impact the evidence would have during the jury's deliberations  'when we've got a man's liberty at interest. '

But Clemens did stop to autograph a baseball as he left

'I don't see how I un-ring the bell.'

Defense attorney Rusty Hardin patted an unsmiling Clemens on the back as the judge announced his decision. Clemens did not speak to reporters as he left the courtroom and made a telephone call in a private corner of the hallway.

Clemens pitched for the Yankees, Red Sox, Blue Jays and Astros during his career. He was one of four pitchers to strike out more than 4,000 batters

Clemens and his lawyers remain under a court gag order and they declined to comment as they left the courthouse.

The obstruction count charged Clemens with making 15 false or misleading statements, including his repeated denials he didn't take performance-enhancing drugs during his 24-season career and even whether he attended a 1998 pool party at Toronto Blue Jays teammate Jose Canseco's home in Miami.

Clemens, 48, pitched for four teams 
during his 24-year career in baseball, including the New York Yankees, 
Boston Red Sox, Toronto Blue Jays and Houston Astros.

He was one of only four pitchers to strike out more than 4,000 batters.

Clemens won seven Cy Young Awards

After
the mistrial Clemens hugged a couple of court workers, shook hands with
the security guards, and signed autographs and a couple of baseballs 
for fans.

'I'm not going to say anything,' Clemens
said, sounding frustrated at the mass of reporters and camera crews. He
and his legal team ducked into a nearby restaurant to escape the horde 
of news people.

Walton interrupted the prosecution's 
playing of a video from Clemens' 2008 testimony before Congress and had 
the jury removed from the courtroom.

Clemens is accused of lying during that 
testimony when he said he never used performance-enhancing drugs during 
his 24-season career in Major League Baseball.

Clemens' lawyer Rusty Hardin was all smiles as he left the courtroom

One of the chief pieces of evidence 
against Clemens is testimony from his former teammate and close friend, 
Andy Pettitte, who says Clemens told him in 1999 or 2000 that he used 
human growth hormone.

Clemens has said that Pettitte misheard him. Pettitte also says he told his wife, Laura, about the conversation the same day it happened.

Prosecutors had wanted to call Laura Pettitte as a witness to back up her husband's account, but Walton had said he wasn't inclined to have her testify since she didn't speak directly to Clemens.

Walton was angered that in the video prosecutors showed the jury, congressman Elijah Cummings referred to Pettitte's conversation with his wife.

 'I think that a first-year law student would know that you can't bolster the credibility of one witness with clearly inadmissible evidence, ' Walton said.

He said it was the second time that prosecutors had gone against his orders - the other being an incident that happened during opening arguments on Wednesday when assistant U.S. attorney Steven Durham said that Pettite and two other of Clemens' New York teammates, Chuck Knoblauch and Mike Stanton, had used human growth hormone.

Walton said in pre-trial hearings that such testimony could lead jurors to consider Clemens guilty by association.
