West Country girl? A photo of Lizzy Vaid taken from her Twitter page, on which she describes her role as 'assistant to Nigel Farage'

The advert suggests she is simply an ordinary worker from Devon, who  will be casting a vote for Ukip at the European elections.

And while Lizzy Vaid’s claim to back Nigel Farage’s party can’t be questioned, it is not just at the ballot box that she will be putting that support into action. 

It is even doubtful whether she will be voting in the West Country.

For the attractive brunette actually 
lives and works in London as Mr Farage’s personal assistant, and last 
night she was alongside him in Gateshead on the latest leg of his tour 
of Britain ahead of next month’s elections.

Miss
 Vaid appears in a full-page photograph in the party’s manifesto, with 
her quoted as saying: ‘I’ll be voting Ukip because they’re the only 
party listening to what people want.’

But
 on her Twitter account the 27-year-old describes herself as ‘Ukip 
Events Manager and Assistant to Nigel Farage, as well as a lover of 
social occasions’.

The 
photograph adorning her Twitter page shows her sitting next to Mr 
Farage, her arm draped behind him in a Ukip group picture taken in a 
pub; to her right is blonde Alexandra Phillips, head of media for Ukip, 
and the party’s leader, who sits alongside Patrick O’Flynn, its director
 of communications.

Her 
Devon connection remains a mystery. According to Miss Vaid’s LinkedIn 
professional profile, she was educated in Brighton and Lewes, East 
Sussex.

It has also emerged that she appeared on another leaflet earlier this year aimed at voters in the Wythenshawe and Sale East by-election.

Miss Vaid also appears in the party’s television election broadcast.

Embarrassingly, only days ago she tweeted a link to a story about Labour being ‘caught distributing false leaflets about Ukip’, telling followers it was a ‘must read article!’.

When Miss Vaid’s true identity was exposed and her role in the advert questioned, Mr Farage, 50, said: ‘I don’t think you’d ask this question of the Labour party, the Lib Dems or the Conservatives who often have group pictures.

‘You know, the leader with 25  people standing behind them. And you never ask to see the CV of any of those,’ he told Sky News.

He added: ‘The fact that Lizzy Vaid is half-Indian and works for us is as far as we are concerned  a non-issue.

‘She is somebody in our promotional material who is going to  vote Ukip.

‘She joined Ukip, she got a job with Ukip because she believes in what we stand for. What on earth is wrong with that?’

Asked why Miss Vaid is not described 
as a Ukip staff member in the manifesto, Mr Farage replied: ‘I don’t see
 the need. You’re going down this media route, do you want us to say the
 religion of all  our candidates?’

This is not the first time that the Ukip leader had found himself facing problems over women.

Last month ex-Ukip Euro MEP Godfrey Bloom, who had the party whip withdrawn after calling women ‘sluts’, said: ‘We all have our weaknesses. Mine is real ale.

‘I’ve never been partial to crumpet. Nigel’s is women. It’s not something he’s denied.’

Days later Nikki Sinclaire, a former Ukip MEP, used parliamentary privilege in Strasbourg to claim Mr Farage had used public money to employ both his wife, German national Kirsten, and his ‘former mistress’. 

He was alleged to have had an affair with his former spin doctor Annabelle Fuller, 32. Both the Ukip leader and Miss Fuller strongly deny having had an affair.
