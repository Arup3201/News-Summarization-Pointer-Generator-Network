Haunting footage has been released of the moment a Gold Coast home become a sickening crime scene with animal blood scrawled on a garage door and a car set alight during the early hours of Tuesday morning.

The grainy security footage, filmed from a fixed CCTV camera across the street, is the best hope police have of identifying those responsible for the early morning attack on the Hazel Court home at Arundel.

Despite it's poor quality and a lack of light, the video manages to show at least two people loitering at the front of a garage door presumably scribbling the message:  'Whers (sic) my money? Tik Tok!' in cat's blood. The silhouetted figures make it difficult to pinpoint exactly how many people are in the footage but police have confirmed it is more than one.

In the rear of the image, at least two people can be spotted loitering in front of the garage door where it is presumed a message is being scrawled in cat's blood.

The silhouettes are lit up by the flame which is later used to throw into the car parked right to the right of the screen

A burst of bright light fills the screen the moment the flame is thrown at the car

The culprits can then be seen moving towards the car holding a flame fueled by an accelerant, before throwing it inside. The car is quickly engulfed in flames before the footage ends with it still burning.

A Queensland police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia the pivotal moments of the film are at 2.17am and 2.19am in real time where the footage starts and car is set alight.

'At 2.17am you can clearly see people in front of the double garage door, and to the right you can see the small black square which is the car later set set alight.'

Detectives have described the grisly slaughter of the cat, and the message which it was used to write, as 'abhorrent.' The RSPCA has offered its own $5000 reward to anyone that offers up information that leads to an arrest.

A 19-year-old man was taken into police custody on Tuesday but released without charge.

A message was left on a garage door at a Gold Coast home in the early hours of this morning while their car was set on fire

Senior Sergeant William Lithgow from Southport Station told MailOnline the incident appears likely to be an ongoing matter with the occupants.

'It's not a random act, the home was targeted specifically,' he said.

The cat had been 'decapitated and otherwise dismembered', though the animal did not belong to residents at the home, Senior Sergeant Lithgow said.

'Police are continuing to investigate and the occupants are cooperating.'

RSPCA Queensland CEO Mark Townend confirmed that no missing animal report had been filed but investigations in to the owner of the animal were ongoing.

'At the moment there is no lost report for a cat of that description.'

'It is microchipped but the data unfortunately is linked to a few owners back.'

Rhonda Gibson, who lives a few doors down from the targeted house on Hazel Court in Arundel, said the Gold Coast suburb is usually very quiet as most of the residents are either retired or young families.

'It's a really quiet area and there's lots of retired people in the area.'

'Nothing much ever really happens here.'

When news  that a cat had been mutilated a few houses down reached the Gibsons, as cat owners they were very upset.

Residents were seen cleaning the horrific graffiti off their wall alongside their burnt car

'Of course that makes you feel ill, but thankfully it wasn't our cat,' Mrs Gibson said.

She also said residents in the house next-door to the targeted home told her they felt the force of the fiery car when the explosion rattled their windows and shook their home.

There had been no previous trouble in the street, and the residents of the house involved were not known to Mrs Gibson or her husband.

Residents and neighbours were woken by a loud explosion around 2.45am and police found the severely mutilated cat near the burning vehicle.

The cat's head was left at the front door of the house.

People thought to be the homeowners were seen cleaning the graffiti off the garage door later on Tuesday morning.

Detective acting Inspector Greg Aubort said the occupants were disturbed by the message.

However, he would not say whether they had an idea who was responsible or if there were likely to be organised crime links.

'We're interviewing the occupants and looking for motives of any persons of interest that might be involved,' he told said.

Police were called to the Arundel address after reports of an explosion

Insp Aubort said given the nature of the incident, police were eager to catch the culprits as soon as possible.

'It's an abhorrent attack on an animal,' he said.

'I think any case where you have the intentional killing or maiming of an animal is a disgusting act and we'll certainly be looking to prosecute those responsible to full extent of the law.'

RSPCA Queensland has offered a $5000 reward to help catch those responsible for the incident.

'They cannot get away with this,' CEO Mark Townend said.

'This is one of the worst acts of animal cruelty that the RSPCA has seen.'

Mr Townend said he feared the offender would strike again.

'It's a stepping stone to violence against people,' he said.

Investigations are ongoing and anyone with information have been urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
