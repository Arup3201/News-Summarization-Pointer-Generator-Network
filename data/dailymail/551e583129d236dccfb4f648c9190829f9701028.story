An audience of 'pandas' has appeared in a Taiwan theatre to highlight the plight of the endangered animals.

Some 1,600 paper-mache made pandas are on display, designed by French artist Paulo Grangeon, at the National Theatre in Taipei.

The Pandas on Tour exhibition was launched by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in 2008 as a way of highlighting the need to protect endangered species, and has since travelled around the world.

After being asked by the WWF, Grangenon created the 1,600 pandas from recycled paper - to represent the actual amount of real pandas left in the world.

For the Taiwan exhibition, the artist specially created another 200 Formosan black bears in order to support wildlife protection acts for local animals and set a green tree frog made out of paper in the middle of it.
