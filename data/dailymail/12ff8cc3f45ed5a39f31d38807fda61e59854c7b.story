Bonus: Network Rail chief executive David Higgins is to receive £100,000 extra on top of a salary of £577,000

The boss of Network Rail triggered outrage yesterday after pocketing a lavish £100,000 bonus at a time when passengers face soaring fares and overcrowded trains.

One in ten trains ran late last year, but Sir David Higgins was one of five rail executives who shared a £350,000 bonus pool despite missing targets over safety, punctuality and financial efficiency.

Sir David is chief executive of Network Rail, which receives more than £3billion a year of taxpayers’ money.

He received a bonus of £99,082 on top of his salary of £577,000, while four fellow chiefs were paid sums of between £59,000 and £67,000.

If more than 92.5 per cent of trains had run to time, the executives would have been entitled to an even bigger bonus. But the figure was only 90.9 per cent.

There was also a bonus cut of 10 per cent ‘to reflect failings’ in workforce safety.

Maria Eagle, Labour’s shadow transport secretary, said: ‘Commuters facing inflation-busting annual fare rises will be outraged at the scale of the bonus packages being enjoyed by a few at the top of the rail industry.’

Network Rail chairman Richard Parry-Jones defended the payouts, describing 2012 as a year of ‘positive progress’.

He said punctuality rates were ‘particularly impacted by a year of extreme weather, the wettest on record’.

Sir David will get a bonus for 2012-13 of £99,082 while Group finance director Patrick Butcher, who is on a salary of £394,000, will get a bonus of £67,658.

Concerns: The Network Rail remuneration committee reduced bonuses for top bosses by 10 per cent over concerns about staff safety

Robin Gisby, the network operations 
managing director, and Simon Kirby, infrastructure projects managing 
director, will both get bonuses of £63,708.

Paul Plummer, the company's group strategy director, is being awarded a bonus of £59,759.

Network 
Rail’s remuneration committee also claimed more could have been done to 
improve workforce safety and decided to reduce the overall bonus award 
by 10per cent ‘to reflect these failings’.

But Sir David and his fellow top bosses will be getting pay rises of 2.5 per cent for 2013-14 ‘in line with the management pay award for the rest of the company’.

NR chairman Richard Parry-Jones said: ‘2012 was a year of positive progress for the company with some great highs - delivering seamless transport for the Olympics - to lows of frustration with a slowdown in our rate of delivering better train punctuality.

‘While this was particularly impacted by a year of extreme weather, the wettest on record, we are working to improve the resilience of our network to cope with such demands.’

He went on: ‘Our executive bonus payments for this year correctly reflect successes as well as shortcomings and as a result have been significantly reduced from a potential award of 60per cent of salary to 17per cent for the financial year just completed.

‘Bonuses are only awarded for achievements significantly beyond what is expected of an executive in the delivery of their challenging day jobs.

‘The remuneration committee felt that while performance was good in most areas, truly exceptional performance had not been achieved in financial efficiency and asset stewardship, and our train performance targets were not met.

‘But we also needed to recognise the significant successes that had been delivered in the business during the year.’

Crowds: Bonsues were reduced after Network Rail missed targets for 92.5 per cent of trains to arrive on time

A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘As a private sector company, it is for Network Rail's remuneration committee to determine the value of payments.

‘It is the independent Office of Rail Regulation's job to ensure that the company's new incentive schemes only reward where performance delivers real value for taxpayers and farepayers.’

But Manuel Cortes, general secretary of transport Union TSSA, said: ‘The rail industry continues to reward failure on a grand scale. Again, NR have missed their punctuality and safety targets and still awarded directors massive bonuses.

‘As passengers face yearly fare increases, they will be puzzled why the directors across the rail industry, who cannot make their trains run on time, continue to reward themselves with taxpayers' money. Such announcements by the industry are the equivalent of several great train robberies each year."

He went on: ‘It adds insult to injury that Network Rail sought to justify such payments by reducing the payments by only 10 per cent to reflect the failure to improve workforce safety.

‘Coming only a month after NR was yet again being fined over a level crossing death, life is starting to sound very cheap indeed.’
