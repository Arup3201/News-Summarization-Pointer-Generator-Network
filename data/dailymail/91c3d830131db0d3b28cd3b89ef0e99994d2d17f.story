These are the first photos of three boys died along with their grandmother in a house fire after spending the night with her so wouldn't be alone on Christmas. 

Terry Harris, 60, died alongside her grandsons, Kenyon, 14, Broderick, 11 and Braylon, 9.

The grandmother was thought to be trying to rush her three grandchildren out of her front door in Fayette County, Ohio, when they succumbed to the devastating fire which destroyed the house and left their bodies badly burned.

The boys lived just two houses away but wanted to stay overnight to keep their grandmother company. 

The deadly blaze was reported at around 4am on December 26.

By the time the fire was extinguished, most of the single-story, ranch-style home had been destroyed.

Fayette County coroner Dr. Dennis Mesker said the badly burned bodies were turned over to the Montgomery County coroner's office for autopsies and confirmation. 

'They didn't want their grandma to be by herself on Christmas night; that's why they spent the night there,' Fayette County Sheriff Vernon Stanforth said. 'The children just adored their grandmother.'

State Fire Marshal's spokesman William Krugh said state investigators are still trying to determine what caused the blaze.

Stanforth said the grandmother's body was found near the front door, with the children near, so authorities think she was trying to help them get out.

Firefighters sifting through the smoldering debris found the bodies hours after the blaze erupted because the site was too unstable and hot before then.

Wreckage and death: The four badly burned bodies were pulled from the wreckage of this house in Fayette County, Ohio, on the morning of December 26. The boys stayed with their grandmother overnight so she wouldn't be alone on Christmas

Early blaze: The fire was reported to rescuers at 4am. They found the grandmother's body near the door, and believe she was trying to help the children escape

'Devastating': Local officials spoke of the grief experienced by the boys' parents - who live just two houses away - and the wider community

'To lose three children and a grandparent, it's devastating to the family,' Stanforth said by telephone from the Washington Court House area some 40 miles southwest of Columbus.

'The fact that it's the holidays makes it even worse for the community.'

He said that he had known the family for years and that the oldest boy had wrestled competitively.

'They're a very close-knit family,' he said. 'They were good boys.' 

Wrecked: Authorities scoured the site after the fire had gone out - and eventually found the four corpses among the ashes
