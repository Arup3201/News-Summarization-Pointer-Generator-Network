Arrested: Valentina Miu, of east London, was one of three people charged with fraud

Three people charged with fraud after counter-terror police seized fake passports and credit cards appeared in court today - with one wearing a Christmas jumper. 

Muhammed Saleem, 28, Tayyab Al-Riaz, 33, and Valentina Miu, 30, were all arrested on Saturday during anti-terror raids in east London.

Al-Riaz, who is charged with possession of false identity documents with improper intent and one count of possession of articles for use in fraud, was in the dock wearing a festive blue knitted jumper with snowflake patterns on it.

Saleem, from Abbey Wood, London, is accused of being in possession or controlling an article for use in fraud.

It is alleged that he had a number of passports and driving licences for use in the course of, or in connection with, a fraud. 

It is also alleged he was concerned in the acquisition, retention or use of £7,000 of the proceeds of crime.

Miu, of East Ham, east London, wore a red and white striped jumper during the short hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court.

She is charged with an offence under the Proceeds of Crime Act and possession of articles for use in fraud. 

The trio spoke only to confirm their names, dates of births and addresses and gave no indication of plea. 

No bail application was made.

Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle sent them for trial at London's Southwark Crown Court, where they will appear on December 22.
