Tottenham have convinced academy prospect Cameron Carter-Vickers to stay at White Hart Lane and sign his first professional contract after late interest from Arsenal.

The central defender, one of the brightest talents in the academy, has decided to commit his future to Spurs and will sign a two-year deal on his 17th birthday.

The Under 18 ace has also been capped by the United States at youth level.

Carter-Vickers is 6ft 1in and his father was a basketball player in the United States before the family moved to Southend.

He joined Spurs when he was just 11 years old and is widely tipped to become the latest in a long line of central defenders to make it through the academy and into the first team.

In recent years Sol Campbell and Ledley King have both progressed through the youth ranks at White Hart Lane and were regarded as two of the finest central defenders in the history of the Barclays Premier League.
