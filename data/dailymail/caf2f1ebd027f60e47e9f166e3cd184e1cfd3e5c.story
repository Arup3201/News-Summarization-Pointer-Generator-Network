A terminally ill mother of two is urging all mums to do regular checks on their breasts for signs of cancer.

Zoe McIvor, 35, from Eastbourne was told that she could have just months to live after she was diagnosed with cancer in both of her breasts and lungs.

Zoe was initially diagnosed in December 2012 with breast cancer after discovering a 17cm malignant tumour.

Zoe McIvor, 35, has been given less than six months to live following her diagnosis of breast cancer

She had chemotherapy, surgery and 
then radiotherapy but two weeks ago doctors told her the cancer was back
 in both her breasts as well as her lungs, and that it is incurable.

Zoe says that although doctors have said she may have several years left to live, she isn't confident that she will live that long.

'The doctor told me 
timescale-wise I could have between six months and a couple of years to 
live - but didn’t sound convinced.'

Following this devastating news Zoe is urging mothers to be more vigilant when checking their breasts for any signs of abnormailities. 

She said: 'I want women to check their breasts over and over and over again.

'If you find anything go to the doctor. It could be a sign of something more.

'I feel I should wear a sandwich board - Check your breasts.'

Zoe is a single mother and will be leaving behind her two daughters, Keira Charley, 15, and ten-year-old Millie McIvor.

Zoe is putting on a brave face for the girls but is worried about leaving them behind without a mother which is why she is urging other mothers to do regular checks in order to avoid such a tragic fate.

Despite the devastating news, she is trying not to let her illness get in the way of her last few months with her daughters.

'We are going to shows and doing fun things.'

Zoe is aiming to keep her memory alive for her girls by creating some rather unique and personal mementos.

The single mum is dedicating as much times as possible to creating memory boxes for her two children including jewellery imprinted with her thumb print so that the girls will have a permanent memory of their mother.

Zoe says that although she dreads not being in her children's lives, she hopes that the memory box will bring some comfort to them.

'I can’t think about not having them in my life or me not being in their lives. But I am making memory boxes for them.'

'I am putting special things in the memory boxes - photographs and ticket stubs, as well as the jewellery.'Zoe, who worked with children in care before she became ill, has been honest with her daughters about her illness and they are fully aware that their mother may not be with them for much longer.

'It’s terminal. I know that. My daughters know. They know tablets won’t take it away.'

Zoe's friends organised a party to celebrate her life on Thursday at Carousel’s on Brighton's seafront, and they all took ‘no make-up selfies’ to raise money for cancer charities.
