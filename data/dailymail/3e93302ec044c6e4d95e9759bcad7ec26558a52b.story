Belgium manager Marc Wilmots has allayed fears over an injury to Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany.

The centre-back sustained a calf problem in training on Tuesday but after a scan he has been passed fit to train again on Thursday with the chance he could still play in the friendly against Australia later that day.

'Good news for Vincent Kompany, he will do light training tomorrow and we will then see whether he can play. Without taking any risk of course!' Wilmots wrote on Twitter. 

Relief: Manchester City's Vincent Kompany has been passed fit to play after being sent for scans on his calf

Wilmots then tweeted the Belgium line-up for the clash with Australia with Kompany or Laurent Ciman to play.

Tweeting the team on Wednesday lunchtime, Wilmots revealed his starting XI would be: Courtois, Ciman or Kompany, Alderweireld, Lombaerts, Vertonghen, Witsel, Defour, De Bruyne, Mertens, Origi and Mirallas.

The news will come as a relief to City manager Manuel Pellegrini as his side face a testing eight days following the international break.

Following Saturday's 1-0 defeat at home to Stoke, they take on Arsenal and Chelsea in the Premier League either side of trip to Bayern Munich in the Champions League and without Kompany Pellegrini would have had a difficult decision to make on who would stand in.

City's £32million summer signing Eliaquim Mangala has yet to feature in a match day squad since his arrival from Porto in mid-August while last season's back-up Matija Nastasic has not made a squad since playing 90 minutes in the Community Shield defeat to Arsenal.
