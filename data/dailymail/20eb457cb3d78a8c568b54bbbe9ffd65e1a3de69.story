Gordon Brown has pledged to remain a backbencher despite mounting calls for him to return to front-line politics in the wake of his barnstorming pro-Union speech.

The former Labour prime minister is credited with stopping the nationalist poll surge in its tracks.

Former Tory defence secretary Liam Fox said he had ‘played a blinder’ while Labour MP John Mann said it had been ‘Gordon Brown who won it’ – and that he should lead the party north of the border.

No return: Rumours of Mr Brown's return started after he made a comment which some mistakenly interpreted as a hint he may want to stand as an MSP - but he denied any wish to return to mainstream politics

But Mr Brown, who still sits as an MP but is rarely seen in Westminster, says he has ‘no desire to return to the political stage’.

On the final day of campaigning for the Union on Wednesday, the former Labour leader made a powerful speech, urging voters to ‘hold their heads high’ and vote No.

Better Together believes it persuaded many Labour voters to return to the No camp, eclipsing the contribution made by Alistair Darling, the former Labour Chancellor and leader of the Better Together campaign.

Yesterday, Dr Fox praised Mr Brown’s ‘positive contribution’ to the battle, saying he became ‘more likeable’. He added: ‘I think he did play a blinder.

‘And I think what was interesting was when Gordon Brown, who can often seem very cold and calculating, when he actually got his teeth into something that mattered to him he became much more animated, and I think much more likeable as a person.

‘Probably a lesson in there for all of us.’ Speaking before the vote, Mr Mann said: ‘Next first minister or first prime minister? Certainly the person to lead Scottish Labour.’

For Mr Brown, who visited a primary school yesterday morning, a decision to stand in the Scottish Parliament would be a challenge to the present Labour leader north of the border, Johann Lamont.

Rumours of a return started after he made a comment which some mistakenly interpreted as a hint he may want to stand as an MSP in the Scottish Parliament.

He said: ‘If (Alex Salmond) continues to peddle this deception then I will want to join Johann Lamont in fighting him and securing the return of a Labour Government as quickly as possible.’

But on Tuesday, when he was asked if he was going to return to frontline Scottish politics, Mr Brown said: ‘No. I’m in this debate for one reason and one reason only.

‘This is an irreversible decision affecting the future of children in Scotland including my children. This is a decision which will be important for generations to come. This is not like an ordinary vote – this is no going back.

‘That is why I am in this debate and I have no desire to come back into mainstream politics.’
