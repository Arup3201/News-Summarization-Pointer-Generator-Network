Britain has triumphed in the battle of the rosbifs after a French celebrity butcher declared its steaks the best in the world.

Grass-fed British cattle has long been regarded as a cut above that produced by other nations, but now the leaders in the world of gastronomy have declared it the winner.

France’s most famous butcher, Yves-Marie le Bourdonnec, also declares that the only way to save French cows is for them to sleep with the enemy and breed with British cows.

France’s most famous butcher, Yves-Marie le Bourdonnec (pictured) has angered his fellow countrymen by claiming British beef steaks are better than French

‘We have lost the notion in France of what a good steak is In fact, we simply don’t know what it is any more,’ he said. 

‘The best rearers in the world are the British.’

But his remarks have not gone down well in the country that considers itself to be the world capital of gastronomic genius.

Le Bourdonnec has been expelled by the French butchers’ federation, who released a statement saying it was ‘amazed at the media exposure given to a figure who has distinguished himself as a detractor of French rearers and is a paid-up supporter of British farmers.’

In a feature-length documentary, Steak (R)evolution, Le Bourdonnec travels the world from the Pampas of Argentina to the Kobe ranches of Japan in search of the world’s perfect sirloin.

The butcher is notorious in France for refusing to sell to Michelin-starred chefs and instead reserving his finest cuts for ordinary Parisians at his four shops in and around the city.

He previously outraged French culinary connoisseurs when he co-founded a Parisian steak house called The Beef Club serving only British cuts.

In the documentary, he argues that France’s three main breeds of cattle - Blondes d’Aquitaine, Limousins and Charolaises - are tough ‘athletic’ animals bred for work and milking but not for meat.

Le Bourdonnec said British breeds like the Aberdeen Angus (pictured), Galloway, Hereford and Longhorn, when grass-fed make the perfect steak due to a marbling effect which produces tender and flavoursome beef

But the British breeds Aberdeen Angus, Galloway, Hereford and Longhorn, when grass-fed, make the perfect steak due to the marbling effect which produces tender and flavoursome beef.

‘We’ve only really been eating grilled meat in France for the past 30 years, whereas you rosbifs we been doing so since the 16th century and have bred cows for that very purpose, so it’s only natural you have had a head start,’ the film’s producer Franck-Ribiere told The Sunday Telegraph.

‘Our breeds are fine for stews, boeuf bourguignon and pot au feu as they have a lot of collagen, which is good for boiling, but a little fat. A good English roast beef can be eaten alone - you add nothing.’

He is also calling for the French to crossbreed their cows to improve the quality of the country’s beef.

‘This is precisely what we did in wine: we privileged terroir - local soil - over grape variety. Today we have many grape varieties in one area,’ he added.

Emmaunel Rubin, a food critic and co-founder of Le Fooding, a popular restaurant guide, said that he thought people should eat less meat and favour grass-fed - the film’s main message.

But he said he was ‘wary of Robespierre figures’ such as Le Bourdonnec, because the French were used to their national style of beef.

‘A Frenchman against the French in the name of meat? That’s like Asterix against the Gauls. In French we say you should be brave, but not foolhardy.
