An eight-year-old girl from Georgia was bullied so severely that her scalp was ripped and her hair might never grow back.

Aolani Dunbar needed hospital treatment after clumps of hair were ripped from her head by classmates at Roopville Elementary School in Carroll County after she went to school with hair extensions.

Doctors say it might never grow back on the damaged part of her scalp and she might need a skin graft. Aolani also had to shave the rest of her head to avoid infection.

The bullying began after the youngster had hair extensions attached to her natural hair, according to her grandmother Dorris Bearden.

She said the third grader had wanted long hair in the school so she could brush it like other girls.

Bearden said her granddaughter was picked on for two weeks with other girls tugging at the hair.

'She steps in the door of that school and the first thing they do is attack her and start ripping her hair out,' said Bearden.

Bearden, from Carroll County, Georgia, said she alerted teacher's at Aolani's school as soon as she saw the damage to her scalp.

She said one boy received an in school suspension.

Aolani, who has had her head shaved to avoid infection, told WSB-TV Atlanta, that she was picked on as soon as she arrived at school with the hair extensions.

'They kept pulling it and pulling it, especially on the playground,' she said.

'Everybody got a chance, and I was in the gazebo sitting there crying because I have no friends to play with that will protect me.'

The family said Aolani is suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome as a result of the bullying.

Bearden said she burst into tears when she saw the damage to her granddaughterâ€™s scalp.

'It was just horrible,' she said. 'I just cried'.

Other family members who learned about the bullying on a Facebook page have shaved their heads in support of Aolani.

They're also asking people to donate hair to Locks of Love so that they can make a wig for Aolani and other children in need.

'It's not only a temporary effect,' said Bearden. 'It's something that could scar for life.'
