Rail deaths: Charlotte Thompson (left) and Olivia Bazlinton (right) were killed by a train in 2005, a tragedy which has led to 500 of the most dangerous crossings being shut by 2019

Britain's 500 most dangerous level crossings are to be shut after nine were killed and hundreds narrowly avoided death in the past year alone, it was revealed today.

Almost £110million has been set aside for the purge, which will also pay for new bridges, underpasses, gates and signs to make the thousands of others across the UK safer.

Cash will also be spent developing technology to make them more secure.

But how to stop reckless pedestrians and motorists who still cross despite gates crashing down and alarms sounding remains a major problem.

There are 7,000 in the UK and for years there has been growing pressure to act following a spate of deaths.

This has been spearheaded by the parents of Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and her friend Charlotte 
Thompson, 13, who died when they were hit by a train in 2005 as they crossed
 the tracks at Elsenham station footpath crossing in Essex.

It emerged afterwards that four years before they were killed a safety official had raised concerns about the possibility of a tragedy there but it was ignored.

Just last week Chris Bazlinton told MPs at a special hearing that he had received ‘shabby’ treatment following the incident eight years ago and ‘not much has changed at Network Rail in the way that they treat 
these incidents’.

Last year rail bosses were fined £1million for health and safety breaches.

Announcing rail funding for the 2014 to 2019 period today, the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) said it would be increased by £32million, to close around 500 
level crossings within six years. Total funding will now be £109 million.

In total, NR will receive more than £21billion over the next five years to fund the day-to-day running of the rail network.

The ORR will require the company to bring down the cost of running the network by around 20 per cent.

The regulators have given the green light
 to more than £12billion worth of enhancements to Britain's rail network
 to ease congestion and improve performance on the railways.

Also, the ORR will put additional checks 
in place to monitor the company's progress on making the network more 
resilient to bad weather and climate change.

Tougher punishments: New rules will demand better punctuality, after it emerged in August that one in three trains in Britain is late and on some routes more than half fail to arrive on time

Rail regulators have said 90 per cent of trains must run on time over the next five years.

The tough targets set out by Network Rail applies to all regional, London and south east England and Scottish services starting in April 2014.

On long-distance routes, First Great Western must run 90 per cent of trains on time while a target of 88 per cent has been set for the two main London to Scotland routes - the East Coast and West Coast main lines.

The Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) said that by 2019 fewer than three in 100 trains on the West Coast line and around four in 100 on the East Coast line should be hit by cancellation or delays of more than 30 minutes.

ORR chief executive Richard Price said: 'Network Rail has made great strides in improving safety, performance and efficiency on Britain's railways.

'Supported by significant levels of funding from governments, working more closely with the rest of the industry, and learning important lessons from the past, the company is capable of delivering more for customers and taxpayers.'

He went on: 'This plan for Britain's railways between 2014 and 2019 - informed by the public, consumer groups, governments and the industry - requires a safer, higher-performing and more-efficient railway.

'More level crossings will be upgraded or closed; passengers will enjoy better punctuality and suffer fewer cancellations; customers should have a say in shaping billions of pounds of new investment on the network; and the company will continue to bring down the day-to-day costs of running the railways

'With increased levels of funding in vital areas such as safety and closer monitoring from the regulator, we expect

'Network Rail to build on past successes and beat the challenges we have set.'
