Manchester United are moving closer to making £30million England star Luke Shaw their first signing of the summer.

United have been fighting with Barclays Premier League rivals Chelsea for the 18-year-old left back’s signature as the soon-to-be-deposed champions look to bounce back quickly from their wretched first season under David Moyes.

The United manager had feared Chelsea would win the race as Shaw is a boyhood fan of the  London club and had attended their development centre when he was just eight years old.

However, Sportsmail understands that Shaw is attracted by the promise of regular first-team football at United and has told the Old Trafford club he will make the switch if they can agree terms with Southampton.

United have more than £100m available for transfers this summer and are ready to spend big to land Shaw ahead of the departure of current left back Patrice Evra, the 32-year-old fading France defender.

After being caught out last summer when United left it too late to land their major transfer targets, Old Trafford chief executive Ed Woodward wants to close the deal for Shaw before the World Cup in Brazil.

Woodward is also working hard to finalise a big-money move for Sporting Lisbon midfielder William Carvalho.

Sportsmail revealed last month that United had opened negotiations with the Portuguese club for the 21-year-old and they have since been talking to Sporting about finding a way round a £37m buy-out clause that they believe to be excessive.

Nevertheless, Shaw is the current priority as United believe if they can sign him it would send out a message to their rivals and to other targets around Europe that they can still attract the top talent to Old Trafford.

Shaw has one England cap and has been one of the stars of the Premier League season. United will offer him a starting salary of £80,000 a week.
