Rare odds: The gamblers won on a game of mini-baccarat after the deck of cards produced 41 winning hands in a row

A casino is suing a group of gamblers who won $1.5million in a game of mini-baccarat after a deck of unshuffled cards landed 41 winning hands in a row.

The Golden Nugget Atlantic City is refusing to pay the players their winnings even though they broke no rules.

It claims the game was illegal because the cards were unshuffled, despite a promise from their manufacturer that they would be pre-shuffled and ready to use.

The fiasco took place during a low-stakes version of the popular card game where players are dealt hands while trying to predict if they will beat the banker.

But when the 14 players kept seeing the same sequence of cards dealt, over and over and over again, their eyes grew wide and their bets grew bigger, growing from $10 a hand to $5,000.

They became surrounded by casino security guards and management who were convinced they had cheated but unable to prove how.

The April 30 incident was the latest instance of unshuffled cards causing big headaches for an Atlantic City casino.

In December, the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort used unshuffled mini-baccarat cards for 3 1/2 hours before realizing something was wrong.

That episode led to a $91,000 fine against the casino, which fired nine people it said were involved.

But in the case of the Golden Nugget, the gamblers did nothing wrong, and deserve to be paid the nearly $1 million they still have coming to them, according to their lawyer, Benjamin Dash.

'The Golden Nugget appealed to gamblers to come in and play games licensed and sanctioned by the state of New Jersey,' he said. 'My clients did exactly that, and then were denied their winnings.

Gambling mecca: The game took place at eh Golden Nugget casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey

'There is absolutely no law in New Jersey that would permit the Golden Nugget to declare the game illegal because it failed to provide shuffled cards.'

But in a lawsuit filed against the 14
 gamblers in July, that is exactly what the casino seeks, citing state 
gambling regulations requiring all casino games to offer fair odds - to 
both sides.

The 
casino's lawsuit asserts the gamblers and the casino both began the game
 believing it was legal and proper - until the players kept winning over
 and over again.

The Golden 
Nugget said it flooded the area with floor persons, managers, 
supervisors, surveillance and security officers, believing they were 
watching 'a sophisticated swindling and cheating scheme' in progress.

Under the boardwalk: Atlantic City is named 'Gambling Capital of the East Coast', second only to Las Vegas in number of casinos, yearly gaming revenue, and number of rooms

'From the beginning to the end of play, however, plaintiff could not identify any particular act of those players that actually constituted swindling and cheating,' the casino wrote in its lawsuit.

Accordingly, it let nine of the players cash out $558,900 worth of chips. The other players still have $977,800 in chips that they have not yet cashed in.

The game is built on a simple premise: Who will end up with a better hand, the player or the banker?

Gamblers
 are dealt two cards and predict whether they will beat the banker, 
typically a position that rotates among the players at the table.

Smaller
 tables, known as midi-baccarat, start at $100 limits and look more like
 large blackjack tables, skipping the rotating banker and leaving that 
role to the dealer.

Even smaller-limit tables are called mini-baccarat.

The Golden Nugget also asserted in its lawsuit that Gemaco, Inc., a Missouri playing card manufacturer, acknowledged it had provided a defective shipment of cards that were not pre-shuffled. A message left at the company's administrative offices was not immediately returned Monday.

Three of the Golden Nugget gamblers have filed a counter-suit against the casino, alleging the gambling house discriminated against them based on their Chinese heritage.

The three are from Atlantic City, Queens and Brooklyn, N.Y.

One of them, Hua Shi of Brooklyn claims he was sleeping in his room at the casino when someone knocked on the door. When he answered, he was rushed by four Golden Nugget employees who pinned him against the wall and searched him and his belongings, according to his lawsuit.

He said casino personnel held him in a room without food, water or an interpreter for eight hours. After a second search of his room, he was released, his lawsuit asserts.

The casino called the allegations in the gamblers' lawsuit 'completely false.'

'The Golden Nugget values all of its customers and would never discriminate against anyone, including the Asian community,' it said in a statement. 'In fact, the Golden Nugget designed and built an Asian gaming area and restaurant to specifically attract Asian guests to the casino.

'The countersuit has no merit and is nothing more than a ploy by the gamblers and their lawyers to tarnish the Golden Nugget's reputation in order to gain an economic advantage in the lawsuit. We will not let this happen.'

Since the December incident with the mini-baccarat cards, the Trump Taj Mahal has installed a $2.2 million digital recording system which it says has greatly improved its surveillance capabilities, and the surveillance department has added eight officers.
