There’s no escaping the fact that F1 2013 isn’t a complete engine overhaul – rather, a fine-tuned update.

Perhaps the most noticeable tweak, though, is just how more accessible Codemasters have made it compared to its intimidatingly time-consuming rival.

On track: there's plenty here for both hardcore fans of the sport and more causal gamers to enjoy

For starters, there’s the Season Challenge mode – offering a compressed season that can be completed in just a few hours.

Or the pick-up and play Scenario mode that pits your wits against 20 racing challenges. Whereas its predecessor focused on its Career experience (which also returns in full force), it often involved dedicating a large period of time to play through it – scaring away some more casual gamers.

F1 2013 suffers from no such issue, given the amount of short, fast-paced thrills on offer. And with superb graphics, commentary from Sky Sports' David Croft and Anthony Davidson and handling that’s affected by both the finest set-up tweaks and changes in weather, there is plenty here for hardcore fans to enjoy, too.

Hard to master: handling is the toughest thing about F1 2013 - and will take some time to get right

A note about the handling, though. Although last year's edition went some way to allow for driver error, it will still take a lot of practise to ensure you don't finish races with a 30 second penalty.

The mind-numbing Young Driver's Test goes some way to teach you the basics, and the rewind feature makes a return - but the latter still feels slightly out of place in a game that prides itself on delivering unparalleled authenticity.

Away from contemporary F1, and there is the F1 Classics mode - where you race some of the world's best-known drivers of yesteryear around iconic circuits. The absence of KERS and DRS means driver skill and flair becomes more important than ever - and the cars feel noticeably more raw than today's tamed beasts.

Coupled with commentary from Murray Walker, and an optional retro TV filter and it makes for an incredibly authentic, high-speed journey back to the golden age of motorsport.

Authentic: every little detail of the cars have been painstakingly captured

Sadly, there are only a limited number of tracks that come with the standard edition of the game. For more classic cars, drivers and tracks you'll have to buy the Classics Edition or download it.

Aesthetic changes may be minimal - as expected in a yearly update - but overall presentation, much like the latest FIFA incarnate, has improved - most noticeably in the soundtrack.

Multiplayer is catered for via split screen, system link or online while Co-op Championship lets you take on an entire season with a friend.

Brake point: the Young Driver's Test goes some way to help but there's no substitute for racing experience

With next-gen consoles around the corner, it’s only a matter of time before F1 games have the engine rebuild so many fans are waiting for. But for now, F1 2013 is more than enough…

F1 2013 is out on Friday.
