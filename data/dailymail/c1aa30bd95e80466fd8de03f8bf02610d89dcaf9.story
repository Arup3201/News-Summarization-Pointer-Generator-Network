A former candidate for Delaware's Senate accused of molesting a young neighbor more than 25 years ago has pleaded no contest to unlawful sexual contact.

Eric Bodenweiser entered the plea Wednesday in Sussex County Superior Court.

It comes nine months after a judge declared a mistrial in the case when jurors could not agree on a verdict.

No contest: Eric Bodenweiser, a former candidate for Delaware's Senate, was accused of molesting a young neighbor more than 25 years ago. He pleaded no contest to unlawful sexual contact on Wednesday 

A retrial had been scheduled for April in Kent County.

Bodenweiser was charged with multiple counts of unlawful sexual intercourse and unlawful sexual contact and could have been sentenced to life in prison if convicted.

The charges to which he pleaded no contest are punishable by up to one year each in prison.

The News Journal reported that Bodenweiser entered the pleas for 'two counts of third-degree unlawful sexual contact.'

According to the newspaper, prosecuting attorney John Donahue said Wednesday in court the allegations involved a boy under the age of 16.

Bodenweiser won a 2012 GOP primary for a state Senate seat but dropped out of the race before being indicted.

In a statement issued by the Department of Justice, the victim said 'I'm glad that this has finally come to an end and I can finally move forward and get on with my life.'

The News Journal reported that a lawyer for Bodenweiser said Wednesday he is trying to get his client's sex offender registration stipulation waived.

Bodenweiser's sentencing is set to take place May 22, according to the newspaper.
