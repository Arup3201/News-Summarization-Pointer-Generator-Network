The US television show Glee may have to change its name when shown in the UK after losing a High Court battle with a Midlands comedy club.

A judge ruled that the hit musical stole the name trademarked by British chain The Glee Club, which has venues in Birmingham and Nottingham.

Judge Wyand directed Fox TV, which is behind Glee, to pay out £100,000 as an interim payment.

But the order will have to get the backing of the Court of Appeal before it can be fully enforced.

Mark Tughan registered the name ‘The Glee Club’ as a UK trademark in 1999 under Comic Enterprises, some 10 years before the TV show arrived.

He argued that customers were being put off attending his venues in Birmingham, Nottingham, Oxford and Cardiff because people associated them with the teen musical drama.

Senior executives from Rupert Murdoch's Fox TV were flown in to contest the claims, saying they had no prior knowledge that the comedy clubs or their trademark existed.

They argued that changing the name would be costly and complex and accused Comic Enterpises of money-grabbing because it is seeking damages.

But today High Court judges sitting in London ruled that the trademark had been breached and rubbished claims that changing the show’s name in the UK would be difficult.

Judge Wyand said: ‘I find it hard to believe that the cost of the re-titling and publicising of the new name would be so prohibitive compared to the value of the series. I was told many times during the course of the trial how this series is a ‘blockbuster.’

Fox said it would appeal against his ruling.
