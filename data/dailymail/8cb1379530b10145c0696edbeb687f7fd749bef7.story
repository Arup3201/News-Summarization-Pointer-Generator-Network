The links between where you live and the adverse affects on your health are well documented.

Busy roads, power plants and a dense urban neighbourhoods all increase a person's exposure to air pollution, and secondhand smoke - raising the risk of stroke, heart disease and cancer.

But location is also thought to be vital when it comes to the health of your skin.

A new study has found a person's postcode could determine their risk of developing eczema - a painful skin complaint affecting one in five people.

Skincare company Salcura examined almost 24,000 orders for treatments to help ease the condition in adults and children.

And their findings highlighted a direct correlation between hard water and demand for eczema cures.

In the last 18 months, demand for treatments was highest in London, with the West Midlands, Essex and Surrey also appearing in the top five.

Experts noted all are areas of very hard water.

Skincare company Salcura has developed an online portal allowing people to discover if they are at increased risk of eczema because of the water in the area where they live. By entering your postcode on the site, you can discover the hardness of your water supply

The only exception in the top five was Lancashire, an area of soft water. 

The lowest levels of demand for eczema treatments were in Perthshire, Falkirk, Orkney Islands and Clackmannanshire - all areas with soft water, according to Southern Water.

And the company has now devised an online portal to enable people to check the water in their area. 

Dermatologists and the NHS recognise hard water is a common trigger for exacerbating eczema.

The skin requires a certain level of moisture, fats and oils to lubricate the skin, retain water and keep the skin plump.

Past studies have found eczema sufferers often don't produce the necessary levels to maintain healthy skin.

When the skin is dry, gaps can appear between the cells, allowing germs, bacteria and allergens to get through and cause irritation.

That irritation can trigger the symptoms of eczema - itchy, red, inflamed, cracked and sore skin.

Some chemicals can aggravate the condition, with sufferers finding certain detergents, soaps and perfumes can cause problems, stripping the skin of its natural oils. 

Hard water contains a considerable amount of dissolved minerals, such as calcium and magnesium, whereas soft water only contains sodium. 

It can also be responsible for scum on dishes and bathtubs as the minerals make soap less effective.

Dr Stefanie Williams, medical director at European Dermatology London said these minerals lessen moisture levels in our skin, which, in turn, can aggravate skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis.

On top of this - in areas with soft water, people use less soap, shampoo and washing powder on a daily basis, which therefore moderates skin contact to harsh chemicals and potential irritants.

Bio-medical research scientist, Dr Martin Schiele, founder of Salcura, said: 'From a scientific point of view the idea that hard water will have an effect on eczema makes sense on paper.

'I have always believed that it formed part of a wider mix of external factors affecting the prevalence of eczema.

'Where hard water exists, an often invisible layer of minerals deposit on the skin after bathing or washing. 

'Where the skin barrier function is deficient, these alkali deposits can irritate skin and cause inflammation and itching in the same way that other allergens such as chlorine and pollens cause the same sort of problems.'

While the top three areas, showing highest demand for eczema products, all have big populations the sales are not directly related to population size.

Somerset, which is also in the top 10, has roughly the same population as Warwickshire, which comes in the bottom 50. 

The links between hard water and eczema have long been debated by scientists.  

A study by the Centre of Evidence Based Dermatology in the UK in 2010 failed to prove if a water softener in the homes of children with eczema helped to reduce the severity of the condition.

However, an earlier study by Professor Williams of Nottingham University in 1998, found eczema is up to 44 per cent more common in primary school children living in hard water areas, than in those who live in areas where the water is soft. 

NICE also identified hard water as an environmental trigger of eczema, in its 2007 guidelines on atopic eczema in children.

Commenting on the findings of the 2009 Softened Water Eczema Trial, Tony Frost, from the UK Water Treatment Association, said: 'While this trial did not provide the supporting evidence expected, 66 per cent of home owner participants opted to purchase the water softener after the trial.

Eczema causes itchy, red, inflamed, cracked and sore skin. Mother-of-one Henriett Azam said her daughter started to suffer with the painful condition, pictured on her arms, when she was just 10 months old. Cases are usually diagnosed within the first few weeks or months of life

'In addition, water softener suppliers continue to receive customer reports of improvement in eczema conditions after a water softener has been installed.'

Mother-of-one Henriett Azam, from Peterborough - an area of hard water - said she saw a difference in her 10-month-old daughter's eczema in just four weeks, after installing a water softener.

She said: 'I started to see a difference in my daughter's skin in a month, and after two months, her eczema had cleared up completely. 

'Previously, her eczema would be exacerbated when she was hot, and at bath-time – even if we just used water.'

Dr Schiele added: 'These sales figures clearly illustrate that customers living in areas of hard water in the UK are buying more products to treat eczema, than those living in areas of soft water.'

The analysis carried out by Salcura included sales from the Bioskin Junior Range, which has five products including a daily spray, a cream and three bath time products, as well as the adult range of products.

Salcura products contain nutrient based formulations which help to support the skin's natural healing process, effectively delivering proven active ingredients into the skin and restoring moisture.  

Paula Beattie, consultant dermatologist and British Skin Foundation spokeswoman, said: 'There is increasing evidence that children living in areas with domestic hard water have an increased risk of eczema and more severe eczema especially if they have a genetically inherited tendency to dry skin. 

'The reasons for this have not been fully elucidated but using increased amounts of soap to produce the same lather contributes."

And Sandra Lawton OBE, dermatology nurse consultant and BSF spokeswoman, added: 'We know from work previously undertaken that eczema is more common in hard water areas and that a further study showed no benefit of using water softeners. 

'What is important for children with eczema is to use emollients on a regular basis to wash,moisturise and protect their skin.'

Also known as atopic eczema, it is an inflammatory condition affecting the skin.

Atopic is the term used to describe conditions such as asthma, eczema, seasonal rhinitis and hayfever - which often have a genetic basis.

Eczema is the term used to describe the changes in the upper layer of skin.

They can include redness, blistering, oozing, crusting, scaling, thickening and sometimes pigmentation.

The skin condition affects both men and women and is commonly diagnosed in the first weeks or months of life.

Ms Azam, from Peterborough - an area of hard water - said she saw a difference in her 10-month-old daughter's eczema in just four weeks, after installing a water softener, pictured

It is most common in children, affecting at least 10 per cent of infants at some stage.

Eczema often disappears in childhood, but it can carry into adult life.

In rare cases it can develop for the first time in adulthood.

The causes of eczema are still not fully understood.

The condition tends to run in families, with genetic make-up thought to play a part.

The main symptom is an itching sensation.

Scratching to relive an itch may be the cause for many of the changes seen on the skin.

It can be so severe it interrupts a sufferer's sleep.

The condition can affect all areas of the body, including the face.

Most commonly sufferers find the bends of their elbows and knees, the area around their wrists and neck, are affected.

A sufferers skin will be red and dry and scratch marks and bleeding are common.

During a flare up it is common to see small water blisters on the hands and feet, or the affected areas become moist and weepy.

A number of factors can trigger a flare up, including heat, dust and contact with irritants including soaps and detergents.

Having a cold, bacterial and viral infections, stress and dry skin can also result in a flare up.
