Revealing: Meg Hillier said anger had been fuelled by reports that MPs were demanding a pay rise

Politicians are pressing for state regulation of the Press as direct revenge for the expenses scandal, a former minister warned yesterday.

Labour MP Meg Hillier said some MPs were willing to use the power of Parliament ‘to bad effect’ in order to get back at the Press.

Miss Hillier, a former journalist, said anger had been fuelled by reports last month that MPs were demanding a 32 per cent pay rise - with one MP telling her personally that they now backed state regulation.

In an interview with Press Gazette she said: ‘The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority had done this rather bizarre survey asking MPs what we should be paid.

‘So this was published and papers reported it as: “These fat cat MPs all think they should be paid 20 per cent more”. Which was not the case - but that was what the survey sort of suggested - it wasn’t entirely accurate, it was an extrapolation from the survey.

‘And this MP said to me, “well... I wasn’t going to vote for statutory underpinning, but I’m minded now to do so.”

If that happens on something as little as one storm in a teacup story about a little survey of 100 MPs on their salaries, and the coverage of that, what if there is something more?

‘That shows you that the psychology exists in the pack of (not all of the) 650 MPs... that there can be a desire to use the powers that are there to bad effect.’

Miss Hillier said she disagreed with Ed Miliband’s demand for new laws on Press regulation, adding: ‘I just think we have to have a look at where we want to be in 20, 30, 40, 50 years’ time. And once you do this it’s very hard to unwind it.’

Speaking yesterday she said the agenda was also driven partly by a ‘very anti-Murdoch feeling among some of my colleagues’.

Miss Hillier said the media also had a duty to demonstrate that it was willing to act more responsibly in the future.

But she called for politicians to support a free Press - arguing that an unregulated Internet would result in a worse situation.

‘Of course we get criticised in politics,’ she said. ‘I don’t mind as long as it is accurate, and I do think the media has to do more to stand up for good standards.

‘Everyone should be wary of a world where we have to rely on Internet bloggers for news. But if we don’t have a good, professional media we will just have more bloggers.’
