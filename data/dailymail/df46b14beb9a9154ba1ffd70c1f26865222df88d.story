Glasgow's chances of hosting Britain’s Davis Cup quarter-final against France appear to be on rise following initial talks with the LTA.

Although Andy Murray immediately expressed a desire to play the July tie on a grass court, the fact that neither Wimbledon nor the Queen’s Club will be available is believed to be pushing decision makers towards a return to the Emirates Arena.

The only available outdoor grass arena with a big enough capacity is in Eastbourne - but neither the players nor captain Leon Smith are keen on playing at a venue renowned for a lack of atmosphere.

The noise and passion of the Scottish crowd played a huge part in the weekend win over the USA, sparking a debate within the LTA over whether that X factor may outweigh any disadvantage that comes from not playing on grass.

While Murray prefers it to the indoor hard court, he would be favourite to beat any of his French opponents on any surface – while British No 2 James Ward is actually better when he moves on to the artificial surface, potentially the decisive factor when the final call is made.

Sportsmail understands that the city authorities are willing to leave the July 17-19 dates clear in the hope of getting the nod over the coming week or so.

Unfortunately, because it takes about a week to set up the court, a Bette Midler concert would rule out taking the quarter-final to The Hydro, the city’s biggest indoor venue.

But a return to the Emirates, which hosted over 21,000 fans over three days, is very much on the cards.

Although no one from Glasgow Life would comment on their plans yesterday, a spokesman said: ‘The atmosphere at the weekend was electric and Glasgow proved, once again, why we are one of the world’s top sporting cities. Any decision on hosting future Davis Cup ties would be for the LTA.’
