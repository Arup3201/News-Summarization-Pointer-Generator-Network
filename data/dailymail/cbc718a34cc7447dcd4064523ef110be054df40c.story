Swansea have lined up a £1.75million deal to sign Exeter’s midfield starlet Matt Grimes in the January transfer window.

The move will catapult the 19-year-old midfielder from his current £500 a week pay packet to earn £10,000 a week with the Premier League club - which would work out as a 1,900 per cent increase in his wages.

Grimes, who has played three times for England’s Under 20 team, has also been watched by Liverpool and Sunderland.

But Swans boss Garry Monk has beaten them to the punch to sign a player he believes has the passing skills to challenge for a place in his team.

And he has convinced the talented youngster his career will be in safe hands at the Liberty Stadium because his own experience of playing in all four divisions means he’s not afraid to dip into the lower league’s to give talent a chance.

Exeter boss Paul Tisdale agreed the fee was too big for the League Two club to turn down, but wanted to do a deal to loan his star player back for the remainder of this campaign.

But Swansea refused to agree because they want the player to go straight into their first team squad to start learning their style, and believe he could figure in the Premier League before the end of the season.

Grimes, born in Exeter and a product of the League Two club’s youth system, has been earning rave reviews since breaking into Paul Tisdale’s first team at the start of last season.

He won the club’s Player of the Year trophy for his performances in central midfield – although he can also operate on the left.
