Orion Koshinsky, 23, of East Bridgewater, Massachusetts, told passengers on a JetBlue flight he was a soldier to get free drinks, then got drunk, forcing plane to divert

A man headed to rehab in Florida, who told passengers on a flight he was a soldier to score free booze, got drunk and threatened flight attendants, forcing the plane to divert.

Orion Koshinsky, 23, of East Bridgewater, Massachusetts, boarded JetBlue flight 1969 the night of March 6 from Boston to Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

The website The Smoking Gun reported that Koshinsky was making the trip to enter a rehab facility.

After the flight took off, Koshinsky stood up and told passengers, 'I want to make sure everybody on the plane knows I'm in the military and you can buy me drinks,' according to an affidavit signed by an FBI agent who investigated the incident. The affidavit also says that Koshinsky told a flight attendant, 'I'm in the military. What can I get for free?'

Koshinsky has never been in the military. He works at a fruits and vegetables market, according to his Facebook profile.

Passengers then bought Koshinsky three drinks, after which he became disruptive by throwing a passenger's bag into the aisle and cursing loudly.

Lead flight attendant Jeannie Piel then instructed Koshinsky to get out of his seat and go to the lavatory. When Koshinsky didn't respond, Piel attemped to unbuckle his seat belt, at which point he told her, 'Don't touch me. I'll kill you.'

Flight attendants considered cuffing Koshinsky, but decided against it as they thought it might set him off even more.

Piel then called the captain on the intercom. They both decided that Koshinsky was was enough of a threat to land the plane, and the flight was diverted to Jacksonville, Florida. Piel later told FBI investigators Koshinsky's behavior was 'unstable,' adding she was 'very nervous' about 'what he might be capable of.'

Koshinsky was arrested in Jacksonville and charged with interfering with a flight crew, a felony that carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.

On Monday, a federal judge ordered Koshinsky released and sent to Treasure Coast Recovery, in Stuart, about 80 miles north of Fort Lauderdale.
