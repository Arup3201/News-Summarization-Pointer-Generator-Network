The world's most popular Pinterest users are earning up to $250,000 a year, thanks to an increasing number of lucrative endorsements and brand collaborations arranged via a select group of Pinterest-focused talent agencies.

According to Kyla Brennan, founder of HelloSociety, one of the top Pinterest agencies in the country, big name brands, including Kmart, Sephora and Kate Spade, are lining up to work with her clients - many of whom boast upwards of 1.8 million followers on the site.

'Pinterest is built for commerce,' the 29-year-old, whose Los Angeles-based agency pulled 12.5 million in revenue last year, told Re/Code.

Indeed, some of the projects her clients have worked on have proved so successful for brands that they have diverted funds away from advertising on other social media platforms in order to invest more money in Pinterest which, as she points out, is ripe for retail partnerships given its catalogue-like setup.

According to HelloSociety's website, previous projects completed by its pinners include creating recipes to promote major motion pictures, shooting editorial-style outfit inspiration for clothing lines, and coming up with crafts inspired by the spokeswoman for an auto insurance company.

Fashion and beauty brands such as Kate Spade, Gap and Sephora have commissioned boards from HelloSociety's 350-plus pinners.

As opposed to sites like YouTube, where overnight celebrities are made through viral success, many of Pinterest's most followed users are simply those who were early adopters of the platform, and thus were recommended to new users.

One would be hard-pressed to name a famous 'Pinfluencer', and Ms Brennan understands why the idea of one making a six-figure sum could raise skepticism.

'People hear Pinterest star and they’re like, "what?!",' she said. 'But after three years of doing this, seeing clients making hundreds of thousands of dollars and quit their jobs and pin full time, it’s real.'

She adds that it’s much harder to get a huge audience in Pinterest than on other social networks, making Pinfluencers particularly valuable.

'It’s just much rarer than something like YouTube, where you make one viral video and there you are,' she said.
