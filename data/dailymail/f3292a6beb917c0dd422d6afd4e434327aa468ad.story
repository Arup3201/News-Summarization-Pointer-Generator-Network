Since watching the Royal wedding in April 2011 eight-year-old Mia Legname has avidly followed every move made by Prince William and his wife Kate.

While most girls her age are tearing their way through One Direction's 
latest autobiography, Mia collects every single newspaper and magazine 
cutting featuring the Royal couple and records all of their TV 
appearances.

At birthdays and Christmas she asks for souvenir mugs, plates, 
paperweights and even has a replica of Kate Middleton's blue sapphire engagement ring.

Parents Christine and Joe can't walk past a shop 
window without Mia searching for any hint of the royal couple, spending 
hundreds of pounds on Royal-mad Mia.

Christine, 43, said: 'I remember
 watching Diana get married when I was a child, and I wanted my children
 to remember this historic day like I did.

'So I organised a party with a group of friends and their kids, and we sat them all down to watch the wedding.

'After
 about an hour most of them were bored, but not Mia. She was glued to 
the TV screen, completely enthralled in what she was watching.

'After
 that we had to keep every single newspaper and magazine which featured 
the wedding for her - and from there it just snowballed. She became 
absolutely obsessed.'

The avid royalist even persuaded her local 
newsagents to keep all of the coverage to one side for her when Prince 
George was born after reluctantly going on a family holiday to Bulgaria.

Christine
 said: 'Mia was absolutely devastated when she realised that we were 
going to be away on holiday when Prince George was born.

'She had been so excited about the new royal baby, she was so upset when she found out we wouldn't be in the country.

'But
 one of the ladies in the local newsagents said she would keep all of 
the coverage for Mia so she could read all about it when we got home.

'And of course, every morning on holiday we had to check the newspapers and the Internet to see whether he had been born yet.'

Over
 the past three years Mia has built up a horde of regal relics which 
have taken over her bedroom at home in Wrexham, North Wales.

And 
rather than walls dedicated to posters of boy bands, or shelves 
lined with toys, her bedroom serves as a shrine to William and Kate.

Christine
 said: 'It is all about William and Kate for Mia, without a doubt. It is
 her dream in life to be able to meet them one day.

'She isn't interested in boybands or other celebrities. No one else gets a look in.

'Her
 room is just cluttered with posters and cuttings, and her books, boxes 
and boxes of things, she likes to keep absolutely everything.

'We 
have had to put some of the boxes filled with old magazines and cuttings
 in the loft, she just doesn't have the space for it all in her bedroom.
 It's a tip.'

Mia recently added a prized possession to her horde as the schoolgirl received a letter from Buckingham Palace after she sent a homemade Christmas card to Prince George

And Mia recently added a prized possession to her 
horde, the schoolgirl received a letter from Buckingham Palace after she
 sent a homemade Christmas card to Prince George.

The letter included four photo postcards and the message 'Thank you for your Christmas wishes'.

Christine,
 who is also mum to 13-year-old Olivia, said: 'Mia made her own 
Christmas card especially for the Royal family, with a picture of her 
with William and Kate's waxworks at Madame Tussauds.

'We sent it to Buckingham Palace in November with the hope they would receive it.

'We
 sent it in November but when Christmas passed and we hadn't had a 
reply, Mia gave up hope. So I couldn't believe it when we got a reply 
just two weeks ago.

'The letter came when she was at school - but as 
soon as she got home and saw the envelope she was ecstatic. She couldn't
 wait to open it and read what it said.'

Mia said: 'My absolute favourite thing is my replica of Kate Middleton's engagement ring."I love it so much because it is exactly the same as the one that Kate has herself.'
