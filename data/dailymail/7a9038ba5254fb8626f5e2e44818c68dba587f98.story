There has been a huge Spring time boost in houses going up for auction this week, with 2,057 homes under the hammer across Australia.

In capital cities across the country 1,692 properties are listed for auction this week compared to 1,054 for the same period last year.

But what you will find on offer will vary widely depending on where you live in Australia.

'In Melbourne about a third of properties sell at auction but there is only 10 or 20 homes in Perth for auction,' auction expert Robert Larocca told Daily Mail Australia.

This house in Middle Park, Melbourne, Victoria is up for auction on Saturday 06 September. It is a unique property with distinguished interiors of grand proportions

The house boasts three beautiful bedrooms, including a stunning main bedroom with a balcony overlooking the bay (left)

Auctions are a good selling method in a competitive market or when you have a 'reasonably unique property', the RP Data auction spokesperson said.

'In inner-city markets houses are more unique and there is a great scarcity factor. In a competitive market that can be in the seller's favour.'

As the spring auctions kick off, Mr Larocca has given his advice for buying and selling at auction.

There are 765 auctions scheduled in Melbourne this week compared to 901 last week and 530 this time last year.
