Death rates from hip fracture are six times higher at the worst hospitals than they are at the best, according to a report showing some are providing ‘unacceptable’ levels of care to frail patients.

Experts said patients were dying because they were not being operated on soon enough, not being seen by specialists and there were not enough nurses.

Every year, more than 60,000 elderly people are admitted to wards in England because of a hip fracture, of which around 5,000 die within a month.

Those with high death rates within 30 days of admission include:

At the best hospitals, only 2 per cent die within 30 days of admission, but at the worst the death rate is 13 per cent.

Doctors said two units were ‘a consistent cause for concern’: the Luton and Dunstable Hospital (death rate 13 per cent) and Watford General (12 per cent).

Other hospitals with higher rates include Frenchay in Bristol, Norfolk and Norwich and the William Harvey in Ashford, Kent.

Katherine Murphy of the Patients Association said: ‘It is unacceptable that this postcode lottery is allowed to happen and further evidence the elderly get neglected and ignored.’
