A schoolgirl was left looking like a victim of an acid attack after spilling nail glue on her leg while having a do-it-yourself manicure.

Lois Archer, 15, could be scarred for life after the accident, and doctors have told her she may need a skin graft after the wound became infected.

The incident happened when she was at a friend's house earlier this month and the pair were giving each other beauty treatments.

The glue, which was bought online and is manufactured by an obscure chemicals firm, fell onto Lois' leg and left a horrific burn.

Her mother Adrienne, 36, said: 'It was incredible - it is like she was burned in an acid attack.

'Her friend was doing the false nails on her and Lois was holding the glue bottle on her knee - but it slipped and tipped.

'It burnt through her trousers. Her leg was sizzling and smoking and the glue left a big huge burn on her thigh.

'Doctors are going to decide if she needs a skin graft to repair the damage.'

Anger: Mrs Archer has now complained to the local trading standards authority about the manicure glue

Lois, from Cwmavon in South Wales, went to the minor injuries unit at Neath Port Talbot Hospital following the incident on January 5.

However, the injury became infected and the schoolgirl had to be transferred to the burns unit at Morriston Hospital in Swansea.

Her leg was still tingling three days after she was initially hurt, and she has been told further medical intervention may be necessary.

Similar kits are available from multiple websites as well as High Street shops across the UK.

A product identical to the one which left Lois injured is currently on sale via Amazon for £6.40 a bottle, or £10 for a set of six.

Neath Port Talbot Council is now investigating the potentially dangerous substance after Mrs Archer complained to trading standards.
