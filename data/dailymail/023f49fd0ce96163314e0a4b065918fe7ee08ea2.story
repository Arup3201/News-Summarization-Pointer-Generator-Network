After torturing a 67-year-old man and leaving him for dead, these CCTV pictures show the moment two lesbian lovers tried to withdraw their victim's life-savings from a cash machine.

Drug addicts Kelly Barnes, 32, and Jodie Barnes, 31, were convicted of murdering retired bus conductor Barry Reeve.

He was found murdered at his home in Norfolk, Norwich, after the couple punched, stamped and slashed him with a knife, leaving the hapless pensioner dying for up to 48 hours.

CCTV footage shows the pair trying on several occasions to enter Mr Reeve's pin number.

The
court heard how the couple even returned to his home after visiting the
bank machine, stealing valuables and emptying his freezer.

The two women, both from Norwich, who were in a civil partnership, had both denied murder.

But today a jury of eight women and four men found them guilty after five hours of deliberation.

Barry Reeve is thought he lay dying for up to 48 hours after the attack

Members of Mr Reeve's family wept as the verdict was delivered at Norwich Crown Court.

A statement released by Mr Reeve's children said they 'could not be happier with the verdict'.

It added: 'As a family we were deeply shocked and distressed by what happened and 
the consequences for both of us, his son and daughter and his 
grandchildren.

'Our family could not be happier with the verdict, however, no amount of
time these women spend in prison will change what happened and bring 
back our lovely little dad.

'The whole court process has been a very emotional time, however, we 
look upon this as closure and now need to concentrate on our grieving 
and learning to live our lives without Dad whilst trying to come to 
terms with the awful circumstances in which he was taken from us.'

Jodie Barnes, formerly Ramsbottom, who
claimed during the trial that 'God had forgiven her', clutched a Bible 
and looked stunned.

Kelly Barnes shook her head and looked towards her partner.

The pair whispered to each other before Jodie Barnes broke down in tears.

As sentence was passed, Jodie Barnes shouted: 'I didn't lie, I swore on the Bible.'

Jailing them for life, Judge Peter Jacobs said: 'The man who you killed was frail, old and vulnerable and lived on his own.

'His income was limited, he may or may not have had money.

'Both of you have previous convictions for violence and lived chaotic lifestyles.

Kelly Barnes (left) and Jodie Barnes 'took away just about anything of value that Mr Reeve had'

'As a result of the attack, Mr Reeve 
was kicked, stamped upon and punched, then put to the ground in a 
semi-comatose state but he was sufficiently conscious to be able to give
you information.

'Some form of kitchen knife was used to cut this man. Serious, deep incised cuts were made to both cheeks and to his stomach.

'A
forensic pathologist said the obvious: those cuts were made to get 
information, probably both his Pin number and any information about what
was in the property.

Victim Barry Reeve told the pair he didn't have any money

'It
was a grotesque situation that he was lying there slowly dying and you 
were going around his property, stepping over and around his body and 
stealing his property.

'Survival was impossible, death was inevitable.

'You took away just about anything of value that he had.'

He said Mr Reeve's 'mental and 
physical suffering' aggravated the crime and added: 'You were totally 
indifferent as to whether he lived or died.'

Mr Jacobs ordered each to serve a minimum term of 24 years.

Jonathan Goodman, mitigating on behalf of Kelly Barnes, told the court it had not been a pre-meditated attack.

Jodie Barnes's barrister, Graham 
Arnold, said: 'There was no intention to kill. It is distressing that he
was left to die in the way that he was, but there was no attempt to 
finish him off.'

During the trial mother-of-four Kelly 
admitted that they both visited Mr Reeve on February 9 last year after 
Jodie suggested that he might lend them or give them cash.

But
she told a jury that she had nothing to do with harming him and she 
claimed she did not see Jodie assaulting him at his home in Norwich, 
Norfolk.

Kelly claimed that 
Jodie only confessed to her what she had done to Mr Reeve when they met 
up in the gym at a women’s prison in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire.

Kelly
told the jury that Jodie had told her before they visited Mr Reeve that
she had got to know the pensioner through her sister and he had 
previously given her money.

Norfolk Police found a bag that contained Barry Reeve's wallet. The pair who killed him returned to the scene to collect food they had taken from his freezer

She
admitted she was ‘staggering and light-headed’ when they went to his 
bungalow as she had taken drugs including heroin and had been drinking.

When
the pensioner said he didn't have money to lend to the pair, Kelly 
admitted searching the living room for objects to steal and then did the
same in Mr Reeve’s bedroom.

But she insisted that she did not harm Mr Reeve and she was ‘positive’ that she didn’t see Jodie using any violence.

Kelly said that she then saw Jodie looking through drawers in the pensioner’s kitchen and taking food from his freezer.

Kelly said they took property away in five or six bags which they left in his garden by a tree.

She
said they went to a Sainsbury’s store where Jodie tried to use a bank 
card in a cash machine. She claimed that she did not know at the time 
that the card belonged to Mr Reeve.

Police recovered retired bus conductor Barry Reeve's wallet, after the pensioner was found in his home

Evidence: Mr Reeve's blood was found on a pair of jogging bottoms worn by Jodie

They then caught a taxi back to Mr Reeve’s home to collect the stolen property from his garden before returning to the Sainsbury’s store where Jodie tried used the cash machine again.

Kelly admitted using Mr Reeve’s mobile phone after it was taken from his home.

She claimed she did not know how Mr Reeve’s blood got on to her Nike trainers, but she said her clothing sometimes got ‘mixed up’ with Jodie’s clothes when they undressed at night.

The court has heard that Mr Reeve’s blood was also found on a pair of jogging bottoms worn by Jodie.

The pensioner's body was found in his blood splattered home two weeks later after he had died of serious head injuries. He had also developed pneumonia.

Mr Reeve lived off a pension and benefits but had been heard talking about having large sums of money, once claiming that he carried around £2,000 in cash.

Det Chief Insp Andy Guy, from the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Major Investigation Team, said: 'Murder is thankfully a rare crime in Norfolk and Suffolk.

'Even more unusual is the fact that this crime was committed by two young women who clearly were prepared to inflict injuries on an elderly man in order to obtain his PIN number.

'It is beyond comprehension that the pair returned to Barry's home whilst he was dying on the floor in order to steal further items from him.'
