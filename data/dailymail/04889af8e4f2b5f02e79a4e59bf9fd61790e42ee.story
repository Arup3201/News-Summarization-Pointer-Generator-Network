Paul Scholes has questioned Manchester United's transfer policy this summer following their opening day Premier League defeat at home to Swansea.

United have made two signings in Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw but Scholes insists the club should have done better in recruiting more talent to Old Trafford.

Speaking as pundit on BT Sport, the Red Devils legend insisted Louis van Gaal's side lack of midfield quality was to blame for their 2-1 defeat to the Swans.

Cesc Fabregas, Toni Kroos and Arturo Vidal were all top class targets but United have watched the Spaniard join Chelsea for £30million, the German move to Champions League winners Real Madrid for £24m while the Chilean is still at Juventus.

Herrera started Saturday's encounter but Scholes is worried United may not attract the quality of players in the middle of the park who can supply captain Wayne Rooney and co up front before the transfer window closes on September 1.

'We need more players,' Scholes said. 'They miss the likes of [Patrice] Evra, [Nemanja] Vidic, Rio [Ferdinand] and you saw they were inexperienced and got caught.

'But the big thing for me was the quality just wasn’t there in the midfield.

'[Wayne] Rooney and [Juan] Mata couldn't feed off anything. They looked better in the first 20 minutes of the second half and when United got the goal you expected them to kick on and get the crowd going but you didnt see it coming.

'The big thing about Louis van Gaal spending big money now is – who comes in? Is the quality there? The two big players haven’t come – Toni Kross and Cesc Fabregas.'

Scholes also questioned Van Gaal's decision to employ a 3-5-2 formation at Old Trafford, where United's teams have traditionally played more orthodox 4-4-2 formations. 

He said: 'When you look at United the last 20 years its been 4-4-2 or 4-4-1-1 and that where we had all our success. 3-5-2 may be some LVG is a little obsessed with because it worked in the World Cup for him – there’s no doubt about that. 

'But this crowd need a little bit of excitement and for me 3-5-2 is not a boring way of playing but it is a very slow way of playing, all about possession rather than having that thrust and ability to score goals.'
