Is it a bear? Is it a puppy? No, it's Munchkin the Shih Tzu, wearing her rather unscary Halloween outfit.

Cindy Roth from California crafted the fluffy ensemble for her tiny 14-inch-tall puppy out of a plush toy.

She then posted photographs and a video of Munchkin online, with many fans likening the animal to an 'adorable' version of the Star Wars Ewoks.

An 11-second film shows Munchkin bounding up to the camera completely unaware of how funny she looks.

To make the costume, Roth measured Munchkin up and selected an appropriately sized toy.  

She also picked a teddy with similar sandy-colored fur.

She then cut the face, feet and back out of the soft bear and removed all of the stuffing except for the arms.

'I could kiss you forever,' one fan exclaimed. 

Munchkin appears to have a penchant for dressing up and another photo shows her modeling a party hat, complete with pink feather trim.
