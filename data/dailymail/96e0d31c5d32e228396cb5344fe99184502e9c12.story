A brave grandfather has spoken of the horrific moment he saw his blood-soaked two-year-old grandson being 'ripped to pieces' by a crazed dog.

Dave Guess, 49, was bitten on the arm as he stepped in to rescue the boy from the jaws of a Staffordshire bull terrier.

The injured toddler, Kieron Guess, is critically ill in an induced coma after undergoing surgery for seven hours.

It emerged tonight that the dog owner, Garfield King, will not be charged under the Dangerous Dogs Act.

Wiltshire Police said that because the dog was in a privately owned garden at the time of the incident, the Act does not apply.

Kieron's family are now feeling more optimistic for his recovery after doctors told them the boy has started to breath unaided.

Mr Guess said: 'He is breathing on his own now. The ventilator kicks in if he misses a breath, but for the most part he is doing it independently.

'Doctors have started to reduce his coma and he was moving his hands around last night. The nurse has said everything is looking positive at the moment.

'They have said he has lost vision in his left eye but they are going to take a better look at it on Friday. His right one seems fine.

'Luckily they reckon his hearing organs are fine - despite most of his outer ear being ripped off.

'There is still a long way to go, but we are optimistic.'

Keiron had been playing outside his 
house in Swindon, Wiltshire, when his neighbour's dog mauled him, 
tearing at his nose, an ear and an eye.

Victim: Kieren Guess suffered horrific facial injuries in the attack

Describing the attack, Mr Guess said: ‘He was ripping him to pieces - Keiron was a mess.

‘The dog owner was holding Keiron up but the dog was just jumping up and biting him.

‘I took Keiron off him, put him on my shoulders, and ran back into the alleyway.

'I was getting bitten by the dog but eventually managed to get Keiron safe.’

Mr
Guess became involved in a heated exchange yesterday after the dog's 
owner Garfield King blamed the boy's parents for not keeping a closer 
eye on him.

He went face-to-face with Mr King's son Jonathan in a confrontation near their homes.

Mr Guess said said the family were too frightened to return home.

The out-of-control dog, named 'Ratty' has been destroyed, but there is still another one living at Mr King's house.

‘It would be hard for Keiron to come back here after what has gone on - he would be terrified,' said Dave.

‘Something needs to be done. We still don’t know whether the owner will be allowed to keep his other dog yet.

‘But this should never have happened in the first place - the dog had bitten people, including a police officer, and other dogs before.

‘It just does not seem right that no-one will be prosecuted - I saw my grandson get ripped to pieces by that dog. He has massive scars across his face.’

Kieron's other grandfather Shaun Leonard, 46, said the boy looked like he had been 'thrown to a pack of wolves'.

He said: ‘The dog took his left ear off and bit off most of his nose. His left eye was hanging out.

‘He has injuries from his forehead 
right down to his chin. There were holes in his face. The dog also took a
chunk out of the back of his head.’

Speaking today, Chief Inspector Keith Ewart, of Wiltshire Police,
based in Swindon, explained why the dog's owner would not be charged.

He said: 'Our thoughts are with Keiron and his family at
what must be a particularly traumatic time and everyone at Wiltshire 
Police wishes Keiron a speedy recovery.

'We can confirm that this incident happened in a privately owned garden in Swanage Walk in the Moredon area of the town.

'Any investigation must remain within the framework of the law and in 
this case the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 does not apply because the dog was
on private premises at the time of the incident.

'In this case the animal was voluntarily surrendered to the police and 
was examined and found to be a Staffordshire bull terrier.

'It is not illegal to own a Staffordshire bull terrier. However the dog was destroyed with the full consent of the owner.

'Wiltshire Police continue to make enquiries into all aspects of this incident.

Mr Leonard said yesterday that Kieron was 'on the mend' in Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, where Keiron's parents,  Stacey, 22, and 
Anthony, 23, have been at his bedside.

Medics have been tentatively waking the youngster and letting him move around 
before returning him to sleep.

Mr Leonard said: 'He’s on the mend I think and he’s starting to move. They are waking him up, letting him move and putting him back down.

'Keiron’s
got swelling on his face but its starting to go down. The doctors are 
saying they don’t want him to get an infection.

Owner: Neighbour Garfield King outside his home

'They are also saying 
he’s got fluid on his lungs - it’s a bit of blood but that’s 
understandable after what he’s been through.

'Everything we hear now is just a worry.'

Keiron’s family believe the youngster may have wandered through an open gate into Mr King's property, from an alleyway next to their home.

Mr King said: ‘If you’re a parent you have to look after your children 24 hours a day.

'If it wasn’t a dog it could have been a paedophile.’

Mr King's son Jonathan said as he clashed with Dave Guess: ‘I have come up from London to defend my dad.

'He is in a bad way at the moment - he has grandkids himself.

‘We are very apologetic to the family of the child - he is the most important thing right now.

'But the dogs were in the garden and the child has strayed into the garden.’

Wiltshire Police said no arrests had been made.

In September 
last year, a police team raided Mr King’s address, and an officer was 
bitten by a dog after the animal had been Tasered.

It is believed that the police officer who went to the house after the 
mauling of Keiron was the same police officer who was bitten on the hand by the dog last year.

During the raid a local newspaper 
photographer took a photograph of two dogs jumping at the glass door. It
is not known if the picture features the dog which attacked Keiron.

After the raid, Police Constable Mark Giles from 
Wiltshire Police said: ‘The owner was trying to  control the two of them
but they were trying to fight each other and get at us.

‘I had to deploy my Taser to try to prevent them from attacking but one leapt up and bit me even after I hit it in the mouth.’

Speaking about this incident, Chief Inspector Ewart, of Wiltshire Police, added: 'We can confirm that we attended the address where the incident happened
in September 2011 and two dogs were subsequently examined to determine 
whether they were illegally bred.

'A qualified expert examined both dogs and found that they were 
Staffordshire bull terriers and that the owners were lawfully in 
possession.

'No offences were revealed in relation to these dogs.'

Under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, if a
dog bites someone while on its owner’s property, police are not 
required to take action unless the injury is severe or the dog is 
thought to be a danger to others.
