Minimalism may be a hot trend for summer, but one woman has taken it to the extreme.

Except for the rare time she adds a dash of gold or black, Ivania  Carpio, 25, from the Netherlands, dresses exclusively in white.

The Dutch blogger’s dresses, t-shirts, tops, skirts, accessories and even underwear is white.

She doesn’t stop at her wardrobe either: Everything Ivania buys for her home is also white.

She documents her ‘beautiful white life’ on her Love Aesthetic blog and Tumblr account.

Both are filled with pretty pictures taken by Ivania, a journalist, or her photographer boyfriend Romeo Pokomasse.

Now in it's sixth year, Ivania says it is, 'The project I've been involved in for the longest amount of time in my life. My blog has lasted longer than high school.'

Ivania's blog, Love Aesthetics, which she started six years ago, has been covered in many fashion magazines and features pictures of her life in white, pictured here

'By not adding any colour or print, all attention is directed to the techinal details,' says Ivania of her love of white fashion, pictured here

The blog has garnered attention from 
the fashion world and Ivania has been featured in a host of magazines, 
including fashion bible Vogue.

‘I am so attracted to non-colours,’ says Ivania.

'I love seeing other people wear colours, personally I just don't feel comfortable in them.’

Ivania says she find the connotations that come with wearing other colours uncomfortable.

‘When seeing red for example, automatically all cliches come to mind,’ she explains.

‘Red hearts, Santa Claus, the devil, tacky tight dresses, coca cola, Valentine’s Day.

‘I don't get this with white. White evokes more of a feeling; fresh, clean, pure, empty but mostly a feeling of possibilities.

‘And because so little concrete images to mind when seeing white, I can project my own personality and mood onto it.'

She also says that white represents the 'early stages' of clothes.

'When tailoring clothes, the first patterns are also made in a creamy or white fabric,' she explains.

'I think these early stages of garments are beautiful. By not adding any color or print all attention is directed to the technical details and fit, that is what interests me most in fashion.'
