Raheem Sterling appeared to hit back at those criticising him after England manager Roy Hodgson revealed the 19-year-old said he was too tired to start against Estonia.

The Liverpool winger tweeted a cryptic response shortly after midnight on Monday: 'Now listening to... Excuse me for being human. On my way home.'

The message came after Sterling retweeted those criticising his decision, including one post that suggested he should 'try getting up at 5am six days a week and putting in a proper shift'.

Sterling started on the bench for England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia before being brought on in the 64th minute, winning the free kick that led to Wayne Rooney's only goal. 

Sterling failed to complete training on Saturday night after only playing 45 minutes in Thursday's 5-0 win against San Marino at Wembley, and Adam Lallana started in his place on Sunday.

After the 1-0 win, Hodgson said: 'People don't like it when you simplistically tell the truth.

'We were training at The Grove doing a light session but some work in how we wanted to play the game tactically. 

'Just before we started, Raheem had done the warm up and he came to me and said, "Look I really am feeling a bit tired, I'm not in my best form at the moment because I am feeling a bit tired".

'So I said the best thing is Adam Lallana starts the game and you rest and I have got you to bring on from the bench, simple as that.

'As you saw when he came on there is nothing wrong with him and he isn't suffering from anything.' 

Hodgson also claimed Liverpool's poor start to the new Premier League season could be behind Sterling's decision to pull out of the starting line-up in Tallinn.

'There is an awful lot going on in his head,' the England manager added. 'Perhaps it's quite simply the season hasn't started quite as well for Liverpool as they wanted.

'He's a player who's always in the focus and spotlight for England and Liverpool, maybe that's had some effect. But I don't know, it's a theory.

'In mitigation of a young player, when you break into a team like Liverpool and you have a fantastic season, then you go to the World Cup and you do well and people regard you as one of the few who lived up to his reputation.

'Then you come back and you're still only 19 years of age, there are a lot of other things that play a part it people's make up. It isn't quite as simple as the training you're doing maybe taking some juice from your legs.'

Sterling told Roy Hodgson he was feeling tired and not in the right mental state during training on Saturday

Hodgson insists the Liverpool youngster played at his best in the A. Le Coq Arena, and says bringing Sterling on in place of Jordan Henderson should be no cause for concern.

'Don't forget it was two days after quite a difficult game against San Marino. It was two days after the game,' Hodgson continued.

'It was fatigue he hadn't managed to shake off after the San Marino game, it was no more complicated than that. Is it common? I don't really know. 

'At international level, when there are so many good players trying to get their hands on the shirt, I don't think you should keep hold of it when maybe you are feeling yourself that you're not at your best.

'We have to take players' welfare into consideration and there are times when top league teams with Champions League football when players suffer from a physical and mental fatigue.'
