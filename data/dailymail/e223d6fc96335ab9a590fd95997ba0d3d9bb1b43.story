The family of a 107-year-old woman say police treated them like criminals after they were accused of abducting her from a hospital.

Officers demanded that Minetta Webb - who is the second-oldest woman in Britain - be handed over by her family, who had taken her home from Manchester Royal Infirmary just hours earlier.

Hospital staff claimed Minetta was subject to a Deprivation of Liberty Safeguard (DoLS) order.

The family of 107-year-old Minetta Webb (centre) say they were accused of abducting her from Manchester Royal Infirmary. Pictured are daughters Rosemary, 76 and Angela, 68, with grand-daughters Susan, 50 and D'borah, 53.

These allow local authorities, care 
homes and hospitals to restrict the freedom of vulnerable people if it is
 'in their best interests'.

Minetta, who is the great-grandmother of Leeds United captain Lee Peltier, was being treated for an eye infection that had cleared, but after five weeks she developed bed sores.

Her family decided she needed 24-hour care at home and claim doctors agreed to discharge Minetta, but they were stopped by hospital security while leaving with her.

There was a scuffle and Minetta, who has eight children, 17 grandchildren, 28 great grandchildren and 10 great, great grandchildren, had to be carried into a waiting car before being taken home.

But hospital staff dialled 999 and told police she had been abducted.

Minetta's family were left speechless when officers arrived at the house she shares with her daughter Rosemary Peltier, 76, in Fallowfield, Manchester, to say they were taking her away.

Minetta's granddaughter D'borah Peltier, 53, accused police of being 'heavy-handed'.

She said: 'We were shocked when the police turned up and said Minetta had been abducted.

'One of them said: "If you don't let us in to take gran back to hospital were going to have to boot the door down."

'It was absolutely appalling.

'All we wanted to do was take Minetta home, because it was the best place for her to be looked after.

'I felt we've done nothing wrong and I can't understand why we've been treated like criminals.'

Under protection: Manchester Royal Infirmary claimed Minetta was subject to a Deprivation of Liberty Safeguard (DoLS) order

The hospital claims that Minetta was subject to a DoLS order - but her family claim they have never been made aware of any order and police failed to obtain a copy from the hospital.

Police were called to Minetta's home around 10pm on 28 June.

The family claim that seven officers - in four different vehicles - turned up the address and the last officer didn't leave until 2.30am the next morning, despite a paramedic team advising that Minetta should remain there.

Greater Manchester Police say they were forced to act after being contacted by the hospital.

Chief Superintendent Rob Potts said: 'Police attended to check on the welfare of the woman and ensure that her needs were catered for, given the contents of the call made to us by the hospital.

'The officers have been spoken to and I am more than happy from the accounts provided that they acted with the utmost professionalism.

'Ultimately our priority was the same as the family's - the welfare and safety of the woman.

'Once this was established we were able to leave and allow the woman to remain at home.'

He added that he 'strongly' rejected claims officers were heavy-handed.

Minetta's family have accused social services of failing to provide her with adequate care package - forcing them to provide care themselves.

One of her current carers is daughter Angela, 68, who lives in Florida.

Minetta, is now improving after going 'downhill' in hospital, according to grand-daughter Susan Peltier.

Susan, 50, said: 'The problem is social services didn't maintain a proper care package for Minetta.

'They've neglected her and that's why she ended up staying in hospital so long.

'We thought we'd come to an amicable agreement that would allow us to give her the 24-hour care she needs at home.

'It's disgraceful the way they've treated a 107-year-old woman.

Great-grandson Lee, 26, added: 'I'm pretty disappointed at the way my family have been treated.

'I just want the best care for my gran and it's a massive achievement that she's lived so long.'

A spokesperson for the Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, said: 'An incident occurred on Friday, 28 June, when a patient was removed from one of our hospitals against our advice and in breach of a deprivation of liberty order, which had been put in place to protect and safeguard the interests of the patient concerned.

'Greater Manchester Police was alerted of this incident in accordance with hospital /safeguarding protocols.

'Both the circumstances of this patient's removal from hospital and her ongoing care are the subject of ongoing investigation and review by Social Services, GMP and the Trust.

'We are therefore unable to comment further at this time.'

Both the Care Quality Commission and the Mental Health Alliance have criticised DoLS, with the latter describing the system as 'not fit for purpose'.
