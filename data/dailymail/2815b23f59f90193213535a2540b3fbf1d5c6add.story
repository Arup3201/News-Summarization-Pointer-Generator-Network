Investigators want to question two potential witnesses who were near a downtown Los Angeles fire last week that reduced an apartment construction site to ashes.

Authorities released separate videos of two men taken near the scene.

In one, a man wearing a dark jacket and baseball cap appears to attempt to climb over a fence along the edge of the fire, but is pulled to safety by firefighters.

In another, a man with a backpack and sports jersey walks along a darkened street.

A statement Monday from the Los Angeles Fire Department said the men are not considered suspects.

Investigators are asking for the public's help identifying them.

More than 250 firefighters fought the blaze December 8, that sent up flames that were visible for miles.

City arson investigators were joined by a federal team last week at the scorched remains of  apartment complex destroyed by the raging fire that also damaged adjacent office towers.

'It's a city block burned to the ground,' Carlos A. Canino, special agent in charge of the ATF Los Angeles field division, said of the scope of the probe. 

The 1.3 million-square-foot building was still in the wood framing stage when it ignited just before 1:30 a.m. on December 8, leaving an area measuring 900 feet by 200 feet to investigate.

Suspicion of arson arose because of how quickly and completely the building became involved with flames.

'We are not treating this as a criminal investigation, but we are not ruling anything out,' said Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Ralph Terrazas.

Federal assistance came in the form of a national response team from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. They began the day with a safety evaluation of the site.

Investigators will interview witnesses, check security cameras and personal video of the fire, and will use dogs that can sniff fire accelerants.

Canino said there was a great deal of video to review, and a security guard was also being interviewed. He said the fire was initially reported to 911 by a passerby using a cellphone.

The fire set off sprinklers in offices of the city's Department of Aging, ruining 2,000 holiday gift bags containing items such as socks, sweaters and food that were going to be distributed this weekend to senior citizens

The total cost of damage has not been released. The loss of the complex was initially estimated at $10 million. Another $1.5 million in damage was done to an adjacent freeway where flames charred guardrail posts and signs. Traffic-monitoring fiber-optic cables under the pavement may have to be replaced, authorities said.

The intense heat also damaged three nearby office high-rises, blowing out or cracking hundreds of windows. Firefighters had to put out small fires in one tower, where heat also melted office equipment.

The fire set off sprinklers in offices of the city's Department of Aging, ruining 2,000 holiday gift bags containing items such as socks, sweaters and food that were going to be distributed this weekend to senior citizens, mainly the poor and those who live alone, department General Manager Laura Trejo said.

Mayor Eric Garcetti's office launched a campaign Wednesday to replace the gift bags.
