Investigation: JP Morgan banker Gao Jue has sparked a federal inquiry after he allegedly managed to avoid being fired because his father is China's commerce minister, Gao Hucheng (pictured)

A JP Morgan banker has been caught up in a federal inquiry  after he allegedly managed to avoid being sacked for his 'very poor' and 'irresponsible' behavior at work  - because his father is China's commerce minister.

Gao Jue, the son of Gao Hucheng, reportedly performed 'very poorly' in his job interviews, failed to renew his work visa and was described by a senior banker as 'immature, irresponsible and unreliable'.

On one occasion, the 32-year-old  even accidentally sent a sexually explicit email to a human-resources employee at the bank and was given a warning, according to internal emails.

But despite his behavior, he was hired by JP Morgan Chase & Co, kept on during massive job cuts and could have later been offered another position if he had replied to the firm's queries.

The reason for this, according to emails obtained by the Wall Street Journal, was because his father had promised to 'go extra miles' for the multinational bank if it did not fire his son.

Now, federal prosecutors are looking at Gao Jue's hiring as a potential violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, according to the Journal, which cited people with knowledge of the inquiry.

The Act bans giving anything of value to foreign government officials to get ahead in business. Prosecutors are investigating the Asian hiring practices of JP Morgan and other banks.

JP Morgan's decision to hire Gao Jue in the summer of 2007 was reportedly 'widely understood' within the company to have been supported by William Daley, a senior executive at the bank at the time.

Mr Daley, who worked at JP Morgan from 2004 to 2010, is also a former U.S. commerce secretary and served as White House Chief of Staff to President Barack Obama from January 2011 to January 2012.

He had reportedly met with Gao Hucheng, then China's vice minister of commerce, in July 2006, while he was working at JP Morgan. At the time, Gao Jue was in his final year at Purdue University. 

The meeting was apparently set up by Sherry Liu, a Hong Kong-based J.P. Morgan banker, who had previously advised Mr Daily a 'good in-depth relationship' with China would be beneficial to the firm.

Mr Daley later told Ms Liu his meeting with Gao Hucheng - who was promoted to his current position as minister in March 2013 after a high-flying career - had been 'very good', according to the emails. 

Making promises: Gao Jue reportedly performed poorly in job interviews and was described by a senior banker as 'immature, irresponsible and unreliable'. But despite this, he was  kept on by JP Morgan after his father (pictured, left, with US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner) promised to 'go extra miles' for the bank

Several months later, Gao Jue was offered a two-year analyst position at JP Morgan in New York.

Despite the offer, the candidate was said to have performed abysmally in his  interviews. One recruiter, Danielle Domingue, detailed Gao Jue's performance in an email to her colleagues.

According to the Journal, she wrote: 'Jue did very very poorly in interviews - some MDs (managing directors) said he was the worst BA (business analyst) candidate they had ever seen - and we obviously had to extend him an offer.'

During his time at JP Morgan, Gao Jue was accused of performing 'poorly' and behaving in an 'irresponsible and inappropriate' manner.

Below are some of his alleged offenses - and his subsequent treatment by the company. 

ALLEGED BEHAVIOR

- Performed poorly in job interviews (some managing directors reportedly said he was the worst BA candidate they had ever seen)

- Failed to renew his work visa, so the bank had to help him apply for an H-3 training visa, which prohibits 'productive employment'

- Was described by a senior banker as 'immature, irresponsible and unreliable'.

- Sent a sexually explicit email to a human-resources employee at the firm

TREATMENT BY JP MORGAN 

- Was hired by the company following his 'poor' interview performance

- Was kept on amid major job cuts

- Could have later been offered another position if he had replied to the firm's queries

- Was given a written warning for the sexually explicit email

Nearly a year later, Gao Jue received a layoff notice from JP Morgan alongside many of his colleagues. However, after his father reportedly intervened, he was saved from being let go.

'The father indicated to me repeatedly that he is willing to go extra miles to help JPM in whatever way we think he can,' Fang Fang, then CEO of China investment banking for the firm, wrote. 

He added: 'And I do have a few cases where I think we can leverage the father’s connection.' 

During Gao Jue's time at JP Morgan (he was eventually terminated in March 2009 amid major job cuts and now works for Goldman Sachs), he allegedly made a number of mistakes.

One of these was letting his work visa expire, so the bank had to help him apply for an H-3 training visa, which prohibits 'productive employment', according to the emails seen by the Journal.

Another was inadvertently copying a HR employee into an email featuring inappropriate sexual remarks, it is claimed. This move led to Gao Jue being handed a final written warning.

'Jue was given a written (last) warning last Friday and advised that his conduct and activities will be monitored closely and any further violation would lead to termination,' Anil Bhalla, a New York-based senior banker who handled Asia clients, wrote to Mr Fang in an email.

'That said,' he added, 'there is general consensus among the seniors in our group as well reports from people in his previous group that he is immature, irresponsible and unreliable.'

Despite his behavior, Gao Jue was repeatedly saved from being fired, it is alleged. At one point, Mr Fang apparently asked Mr Bhalla if he would take the employee onto his team of analysts.

And later, the firm was reportedly prepared to offer him a position on a different scheme. But amid the support for Gao Jue, Mr Daley reportedly declined to help save his job, saying he should 'move on'. 

'Involved: Gao Jue's hiring was reportedly 'widely understood' within the company to have been supported by William Daley (left), a senior executive at the time. Meanwhile, Fang Fang (right), then CEO of China investment banking for JP Morgan, reportedly said the firm could ' leverage [Gao Hucheng's] connection'

JP Morgan (which Mr Fang has since left), Mr Daley (who is now in charge of US operations at a Swiss hedge fund), Gao Hucheng and his son are not accused of any wrongdoing, it is reported.

Gao Jue's name had not previously been reported in connection with the hiring probe, which JP Morgan disclosed in a 2013 regulatory filing. A JP Morgan spokesman declined to comment.

Th 2013 filing, which was part of a probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice in the US, has damaged JP Morgan's business in Asia, according to the FT.

The bank pulled out of two high-profile initial public offerings, Tianhe Chemicals and Everbright Bank. 

A Goldman Sachs spokesman also declined comment. Mr Daley - whom two employees referred to as being supportive of Gao Jue's initial hiring in emails - refused to discuss Asia hiring practices. 

Former role: Mr Daley, who worked at JPMorgan from 2004 to 2010, is also a former U.S. commerce secretary and served as White House Chief of Staff to President Barack Obama (pictured, right, with Mr Daley) in 2011

Despite the email claims about Mr Daley, the former JP Morgan Chairman of the Midwest did not have an ongoing relationship with Gao Jue nor his father, a person familiar with the matter said.

The Chinese commerce ministry is not a client of JP Morgan nor a banking regulator, but can rule on mergers among multinational companies that do business in China, the Journal reporrted.

The U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are expected to reach a settlement with JP Morgan related to the U.S. antibribery law. This may involve a fine.

It could also reportedly warrant an overhaul of the bank's hiring practices..
