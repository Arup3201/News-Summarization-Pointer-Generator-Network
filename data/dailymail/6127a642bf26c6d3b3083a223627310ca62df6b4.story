Climate-changing microbes, known as Methanosarcina (pictured), may have caused the biggest mass extinction in history

The worst mass extinction in Earth's history - long before dinosaurs roamed the planet - was caused by microbes, according to a new study.

The tiny organisms suddenly began belching out the greenhouse gas methane - which is about 20 per cent more potent than carbon dioxide - some 250 million years ago.

Fumes spurted from the oceans wiping out 90 per cent of all species, from snails and small crustaceans to early forms of lizards and amphibians in less than 20,000 years.

The 'Great Dying' occurred more than 252 million years ago - long before dinosaurs lived roamed Earth - at the end of Permian era.

In the past asteroids, volcanoes and raging coal fires have been blamed but the finger is now being pointed at tiny microbes called Methanosarcina.

These spewed enormous amounts of methane into the atmosphere, dramatically altering the climate and the chemistry of the oceans.

Unable to adapt in time, countless species perished and vanished from the Earth.

Alarmingly, the same effects are starting to happen today as a result of global warming caused by carbon emissions.

Analysis of geological carbon deposits 
reveals a significant boost in levels of carbon-containing gases - 
either carbon dioxide or methane - at the time of the mass extinction.

The Permian extinction, which occurred around 250 million years ago, was one of the biggest catastrophes that caused a majority of the land and aquatic species to become extinct. Pictured is the fossil skull of Dinogorgon Rubidgei, which did not survive the Permian extinction

The Permian extinction, which occurred around 250 million years ago, was one of the biggest catastrophes that caused a majority of the land and aquatic species to become extinct.

Until now, the causes that triggered the collapse of the Permian period have remained a mystery.

Some scientists have suggested extinction was caused by an asteroid strike or a volcanic eruption in an area, what is now called Siberia.

They claim this led to a significant rise in greenhouse gas emissions and caused the mass extinction of the Earth's species.

New research, however, suggests that microbes began belching out the greenhouse gas methane - which is about 20 per cent more potent than carbon dioxide.

Fumes suddenly spurted from the oceans wiping out 90 per cent of all species.

But volcanic eruptions alone could never have produced the amount of carbon laid down in rock sediments during this period, the researchers claim.

'A rapid initial injection of carbon dioxide from a volcano would be followed by a gradual decrease,' said US scientist Dr Gregory Fournier, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

'Instead, we see the opposite: a rapid, continuing increase.

'That suggests a microbial expansion. The growth of microbial populations is among the few phenomena capable of increasing carbon production exponentially, or even faster.'

A timely combination of two factors may have sent Methanosarcina into overdrive, according to the findings reported in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

First, a genetic change allowed it to become a major producer of methane from accumulations of carbon dioxide in the oceans.

Second, a surge in volcanic activity led to a sudden influx of nickel, a vital nutrient that helped the microbes proliferate.
