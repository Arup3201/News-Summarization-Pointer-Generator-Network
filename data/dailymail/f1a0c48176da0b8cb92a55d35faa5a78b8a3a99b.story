Presidential favorite Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday met the man who appears to be angling for his own role on the political world stage - London Mayor Boris Johnson.

The former Secretary of State and Johnson, who is seen by some as a future leader of the Conservative Party and potential British Prime Minister, shook hands for the cameras at her New York office.

There was no mention of gaffe-prone Johnson's 2007 remarks where he referred to Mrs Clinton as a 'sadistic nurse in a mental hospital' in a newspaper column.

Making friends: Mayor of London Boris Johnson meets presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton at her office in New York on Wednesday

Clinton asked the London mayor, who holds dual citizenship of the UK and U.S. 

Clinton and Johnson laughed and joked as they posed for photographers ahead of a 50-minute meeting to discuss terrorism issues facing the UK and U.S. along with the war in Syria and Iraq against ISIS.

It was Clinton's turn to mock the mayor's political ambitions today as she asked whether U.S.-born Mr Johnson had set his sights on the White House.

She said: 'Is he announcing for president? Which one do you think he'll be, Democrat or Republican?'

The jibe came amid criticism of Johnson's 'promotional tour' of the U.S., that some suggest he is using it to boost his chances of being the next Conservative leader - and then potentially British Prime Minister. 

In a 2007 column in The Daily Telegraph, Johnson tore into then-presidential hopeful Clinton.

He wrote that he disliked 'an all-round purse-lipped political correctness' but did grudgingly endorse the then New York senator.

Johnson was on the charm offensive this week, telling The Evening Standard that Clinton was 'an extraordinary politician'.

Johnson was in New York on the fourth day of a six-day trip - his third long-haul mission in the last three months, having already visited Iraq and Far East. 

 It is his second trip to the U.S. in three months.

Johnson, who has dual U.S. and UK nationality as he was born in New York, began his visit with a speech in Boston on how innovation can help the poor.

Following the meeting, Johnson tweeted: 'Just met w/@HillaryClinton for talks on security, the threat of ISIL returnees & the synergy between London & NYC.' 

Mr Johnson also met with former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, as well as the British stars of Broadway and New York fashion week.
