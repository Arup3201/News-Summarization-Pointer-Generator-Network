When Luisa Zissman entered the Big Brother house last week, she looked nothing short of dazzling.

And now FEMAIL can reveal the £1,000 pre-Celebrity BB beauty regime behind The Apprentice star's sophisticated new look.

The 26-year-old indulged in the latest body-sculpting and anti-ageing treatments so that she would look her best on the C5 reality show.

No wonder she looked so good! Luisa Zissman had £1,000 worth of beauty treatments before entering the Celebrity Big Brother House last week, FEMAIL can reveal

Before she went into the house last Friday Luisa had a £145 Skinbreeze facial with facialist Debbie Thomas to get rid of lines on her forehead and around her eyes. 

The Skinbreeze treatment has been 
dubbed the 'NoTox facial' because it claims to mimic the muscle freezing 
properties of Botox but without any injections.

Luisa
 didn't want to use Botox because she didn't think she should have to 
resort to something as extreme as that in order to achieve tight, 
glowing skin.

Speaking
 about the treatment, she said: 'Oh wow, you can actually really see a 
difference. It does feel tighter as well - Botox not necessary now!'.

Luisa also used a £850 Harley Street body-sculpting, fat-freezing treatment called Lipoglaze to take a couple of inches from her hips.

The 90-minute non-invasive treatment at the LoveLite clinic claims to banish over 25 per cent of the fat from the target area without any downtime or after-effects.

Insecure: Luisa was conscious of being in the house with several other beautiful women, like Sam Faiers from TOWIE (R), so she had the treatments to ensure she looked her best

A source close to Luisa has revealed that she was conscious of being in the house with several other beautiful women - like Sam Faiers from TOWIE - and she wanted to look toned and in great shape.

The mother-of-one has previously had the Lipoglaze on her hips, the area that she's most self-conscious about, and she was keen to have a repeat treatment.

She tweeted '@LoveLiteUK ah thanks would love to see you soon I need more Lipoglaze hahaha!! X'

And she also sent out a picture on Instagram of herself having the treatment, which works by freezing the area to minus 10 degrees to kill off the fat cells which then drain away naturally through the body. 

Luisa, who admitted before entering the house that she has 
had romances with both men and women in the past, shared a girl-on-girl kiss with fellow housemate Jasmine Waltz on last night's episode.

While Luisa is best known for appearing 
on The Apprentice, she became infamous when she 
revealed that she regularly took part in sex parties.

She declared at 
the time: 'I have the energy of a Duracell bunny, sex appeal 
of Jessica Rabbit, and a brain like Einstein.'
