Ben Bradlee, the longtime executive editor of The Washington Post during some of its proudest moments, was remembered as a 'journalistic warrior' Wednesday during his funeral at Washington National Cathedral. 

Bradlee, who died last week at age 93, was at the helm of the Washington Post for almost 25-years and was known for his forensic search for the truth in his reporters work and from public officials. 

His funeral drew colleagues past and present including his equally legendary former reporters, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, who with Bradlee helped expose the Watergate scandal in 1972 which eventually brought down President Richard Nixon.

Resembling a funeral for an elected political dignitary more than that of a newspaper editor, Bradlee's service which began at 11am, was marked by elaborate security and leaders from both  parties - including vice president Joe Biden, who broke down in tears during the service.

In a touching gesture before the eulogies began, Bradlee's wife, the writer Sally Quinn, laid a solitary white rose on his coffin and then Bradlee's son Quinn approached the coffin and laid his head down ontop.

After the pageantry of the funeral, invited guests retired to Bradlee's home in the exclusive Washington suburb of Georgetown.

Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry and many government officials and journalists were among hundreds who filled the massive church. 

Few cities could honor a gruff, profane and aggressive journalist quite like Washington. 

Bradlee was a lion of Washington journalism during the glory days of newspapers.  He led the Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of the Watergate scandal that elevated the Post and toppled the presidency of Richard Nixon.

Bradlee died last week at 93 after suffering from Alzheimer's disease in recent years.

Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein were among eight men who paid tribute to the man who led the Post newsroom from 1968 to 1991 - through the coverage of the Watergate scandal that toppled the presidency of Richard Nixon and elevated the newspaper to new heights.

'What is the central part of his character?' Bernstein said. 'It's this: He was not afraid.'

The former Post reporter recalled Bradlee's unwavering support of his young reporters as they confronted the Nixon administration.

'We live now in an era where too many of us are not unafraid,' Bernstein said. 'The dominant political and media culture is too often geared to the lowest common denominator - make noise, get eyeballs, cover the political battles like a football game and manufacture as much controversy as can be ginned up.'

Woodward, who partnered with Bernstein in covering Watergate and now is an associate editor at the Post, said he loved Bradlee and remembered how he prowled the newsroom like a wolf in search of news, gossip or any signs of hidden truth.

'He was a journalistic warrior, unequaled and probably never to be matched,' Woodward said. 'He had the courage of an Army, a lion in all season. He wanted his newspaper ... to be like the Navy destroyer he served on in World War II.'

Other journalists, including Tom Brokaw, also offered tributes.

Donald Graham, whose mother, Katharine Graham, hired Bradlee to lead the newspaper the family controlled until last year, said Bradlee was greater, smarter and even more fun than his reputation.

At times, Bradlee was called a 'male chauvinist pig' for his language and style, but he also had the confidence to work for one of the few women leading a major company in the 1960s and 1970s, Graham said.

'The Post staff could be fairly described as hard bitten. They were a group of men and women who proudly had no heroes,' Graham said. 'But he was our hero, Benjamin C. Bradlee, and he will be always.'

Ben C Bradlee, who transformed the Post into a venerated institution during his 26 years as its executive editor, passed away in his home in Washington last Tuesday night after his health declined due to Alzheimer's disease.

Mr Bradlee joined the Post as managing editor in 1965 before becoming executive editor in 1968, bringing with him a vision that elevated the city paper to one of the top news outlets in the nation.

The Washington Post would earn national acclaim - including more than a dozen Pulizer Prizes - and draw the ire of government officials for several stories pursued by the paper under Mr Bradlee.

The Post broke the first news in 1972 of the Watergate scandal which would eventually take down President Nixon.

Mr Bradlee also oversaw the decision to publish the Pentagon Papers, along with the New York Times, which revealed the extent of US military involvement in Vietnam.

'Ben Bradlee was the best American newspaper editor of his time and had the greatest impact on his newspaper of any modern editor,' said Donald E Graham, who succeeded his mother Katharine as publisher of the Washington Post.

President Barack Obama, who awarded the editor with the Presidential Medal of Freedom last year, issued a statement saying: 'For Benjamin Bradlee, journalism was more than a profession – it was a public good vital to our democracy.
