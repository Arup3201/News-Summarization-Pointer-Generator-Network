Police said Saturday 
they are looking for a transient in the kidnapping of a 10-year-old girl
who was snatched from her San Fernando Valley home before dawn last 
week and abandoned hours later in front of a hospital.

Investigators
identified 30-year-old Tobias Dustin Summers as a suspect in the case 
but couldn't elaborate on the motive or what led them to him.

Police 
don't know if the girl was targeted but said they don't believe Summers 
had a connection to her family.

Police are searching for transient Tobias Dustin Summers, 30, who they say was involved in the kidnapping of a 10-year-old girl

Summers can be recognized by his distinctive arm tattoo

'We have no 
information that the family knew this individual or that the individual 
knew any members of the family,' Los Angeles Police Deputy Chief Kirk 
Albanese said.

About 40 detectives have been 
working around the clock looking for clues since the girl was abducted 
from her home Wednesday.

She was found hours later, wandering near a 
Starbucks several miles away.

The girl was 
barefoot, had bruises and scratches, and wasn't wearing the same clothes
she had on when she vanished.

She told the police two men she didn't 
recognize had taken her from her home.

Police initially said they were looking for two suspects, but now are focusing their efforts on locating Summers.

'This is the only person we are looking for right now,' Albanese said Saturday.

Investigators
have said they believe the girl was driven around the San Fernando 
Valley in a couple of cars and taken to at least two locations, 
including a storage facility, before she was released.

A passer-by who 
recognized her picture from media reports saw her outside the Starbucks 
and called police. The girl had wandered there from the hospital where 
she had been dropped.

Summers, who has a 
distinctive tattoo of a ghoulish face on his right arm, has arrests 
dating back to 2002, police said. Among them are robbery, grand theft 
auto, possession of explosives and kidnapping, authorities said.

Police said they had no details on the prior kidnapping case.

Summers
was released from prison in July on a petty theft conviction as part of
a California law designed to ease crowding in state prisons. He also 
spent six days behind bars in January on a probation violation.

Summers
last checked in with his probation officer at some point earlier this 
month and had been complying with his release terms, police said. He is 
known to frequent the area where the kidnapping took place.

The
Los Angeles Times reported that law enforcement sources said the girl 
was sexually assaulted. The Associated Press does not identify victims 
of sexual assault. Summers isn't a registered sex offender, police said.

Albanese
said Summers had been arrested four years ago for investigation of 
battery that involved child annoyance. Court records show Summers was 
convicted of battery in September 2009 but the child annoyance charge 
was either dismissed or not prosecuted.

Summers
has family in Southern California, according to police, and the FBI 
said it will obtain a warrant for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, 
if the agency determines he has fled the state.

Mystery: The girl suffered lacerations and bruises to her face, had no shoes on and was dressed differently from the clothes she was wearing before she went missing

The girl's parents reported her missing from home before dawn Wednesday.

Police say the child was dropped off by an unknown person in a parking lot near a Goodwill store shortly before 3pm.

A female passerby recognized the girl from the news by her distinctive red hair and alerted police. A patrol officer who responded to the 911 call arrived at Oxnard Street and Canoga Avenue and located the child.

She did not have shoes on and was dressed in a white T-shirt instead of the black shirt she was wearing the night before.

'Her face was white. She looked very 
tired and worried,' Nicolas Jackson, manager of an animation studio
who spotted the girl next to Starbucks, told the Los Angeles Times. 'You could see she had some 
worries for the past few hours.'

First aid: Nicole was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital for treatment

Relieved: The girl's family were notified of her discovery and were later taken by car to the hospital to visit her

She was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital for treatment. According to authorities, the child 
suffered cuts and bruises to her face and appeared confused.

Capt. William Hayes told the LA Times that officers have secured several locations where the then-unidentified perpetrator had allegedly taken the 10-year-old girl using multiple cars in the process.

Police also said they have recovered a black pickup truck that was apparently involved in the kidnapping.Â 

She was last seen in her bedroom just after midnight at her home in Northridge, California.

When her parents checked on her at around 3am, she was gone, police spokesman Richard French said.
