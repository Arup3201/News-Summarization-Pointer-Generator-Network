Hundreds of police have failed new fitness tests which are due to become mandatory later this year, official figures show.

Interim results submitted by 39 forces to the College of Policing showed that 851 officers fell short, with 3 per cent failing overall in more than 30,000 tests.

After taking part in the 15-metre ‘bleep’ shuttle run test, some 253 of the 22,078 policemen who took part (an average of 1 per cent) and 598 of 7,969 policewomen (an average of 8 per cent) were unsuccessful.

The new fitness testing, which will become compulsory in September, was brought in after recommendations made by Tom Winsor, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary.

The worst failure rates were seen in Suffolk (7 per cent), West Midlands (5.8 per cent), West Mercia/Warwickshire (5.6 per cent) and Gwent (5.5 per cent).

Humberside and Northumbria Police were the only two forces out of a total of 43 in England and Wales who boasted a 100 per cent pass rate for men and women.

Data is still not available for the Metropolitan Police, the country's largest force, Lancashire, Gloucestershire and Cumbria.

The Winsor recommendations stated that all police should be made to take a ‘bleep’ test annually, with participants having to complete a 15-metre shuttle run in shorter and shorter periods, reaching level 5.4 – four shuttles at level five.

Police with special responsibilities are expected to perform at higher levels, with dog handlers required to complete level 5.7 and those who handle firearms able to do level 7.6.

Mr Winsor also recommended that from 2018 the tests should be made harder, using challenges based on the type of things an officer might face on duty, but this is being considered by the College of Policing in case it has a detrimental effect on women.

Assistant Chief Constable Rob Price said: ‘The results to date are encouraging and show the vast majority of officers tested are fit.

‘Police forces are sending their results to the college on a quarterly basis and an equality impact assessment is being carried out on those results.

‘New guidance will be issued to forces later this year with a strong emphasis on providing supportive measures to help officers pass the test.’
