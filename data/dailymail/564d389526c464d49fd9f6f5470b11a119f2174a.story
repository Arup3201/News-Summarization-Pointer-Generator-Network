A 6ft 7in soldier nicknamed 'High Tower' was shot and killed by a single machine gun bullet during a training exercise, an inquest has heard.

Ranger Michael Maguire, 21, originally from County Cork, Ireland, was on his lunch break when he was hit in the temple by a shot probably fired by a fellow soldier attacking a static target one kilometre away.

The inquest heard that he was not wearing a helmet at the time and was stood in a secure administrative area of the range in Pembrokeshire, Wales.

Accident: Ranger Michael Maguire, 21, died after being shot in the head during a training exercise

Ranger Maguire had survived a tour of Afghanistan but died after the accident at the Castlemartin Ranges in May last year.

Army medics and civilian paramedics battled to save Ranger Maguire's life before he was urgently airlifted to hospital in Cardiff.

But the soldier, of the 1st Battalion, The Royal Irish Regiment, was pronounced dead within 30 minutes of his arrival.

The inquest in Cardiff heard evidence from Army medic Corporal Michael Gleeson who spoke of the frantic efforts made to keep Mr Maguire alive following the shooting.

Mr Maguire had been standing in a designated administrative area, deemed to be secure, outside the training area with his armour and helmet off.

Cpl Gleeson arrived within two minutes of the shooting: 'I was informed the wound was on the left side of the temple,' he said.

'He was making gurgling sounds and had a little vomit in his mouth. At no time while I was with him was he conscious.'

He said another medic used a manual pump to assist breathing and they rolled him over to resuscitate him.

Missed terribly: Ranger Maguire's family Michael Maguire senior, sister Sheila Maguire and brother Jimmy Maguire have flown to Cardiff from Ireland to hear the inquest into his death

The efforts were continued when civilian paramedics arrived on the scene while awaiting the arrival of an air ambulance.

Earlier the resumed inquest, which sat for two days in November, heard how the group of soldiers were taking part in low level infantry training at the time of the shooting.

It was seen as an early stage in their build up to a second tour of duty in Afghanistan, earmarked for this spring.

The court also heard a statement made by Ranger Maguire's father Michael Maguire senior.

He said: 'He was a sporting, fit lad and very lovable and he was always very happy with army life.'

'I would like to add that I loved Mike dearly and miss him terribly.'

Mary Hassall, Vale of Glamorgan coroner, read the statement into the record to the inquest jury of six women and five men.

Mr Maguire and his daughter Sheila and son Jimmy, who flew over from Ireland for the inquest, listened in silence as the words were read out.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
