Michele Bachmann might be struggling in the polls now but she could well beat all her fellow GOP presidential candidates in another competition.

The Minnesota Representative, 55, packs a punch when she goes hunting and revealed her favourite gun is a semi-automatic AR-15 assault rifle.

She is going pheasant hunting with Iowa Rep Steve King on Friday and claims she learned about gun safety before she was even a teenager.

Sharp shooter: Michele Bachmann, 55, packs a punch when she goes out hunting and revealed her favourite gun is a semi-automatic AR-15 assault rifle

Different types: The AR-15, seen in its various forms, is the civilian version of the U.S. military's M16 automatic or semi-automatic rifle, used in the Vietnam War

'Hey, I'm a pretty good shot,’ she told WHO-AM. ‘I learned how to hunt here in Iowa from my Dad - I went through gun safety when I was 12.’

‘My favourite gun is an AR-15, because you can be so accurate with it. And I scored the best in my class - of any of the men too - in that class.

‘It's a rifle. I love that gun. I love it. It's a great gun.’ Mrs Bachmann refused however to be drawn by WHO-AM on the size of her magazine.

The AR-15 is the civilian version of the U.S. military’s M16 automatic or semi-automatic rifle, which was used during the Vietnam War.

The gun can be configured in many sizes to suit the individual with accessories including silencers, grenade launchers or telescopic sights.

Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, who is also known to enjoy shooting, went hunting with Rep King last week.

Rep King also hunted with Mr Santorum in October in Iowa - and with Texas Governor Rick Perry. All three share a mutual love of guns.

Mrs Bachmann’s outspoken love of hunting has drawn comparisons to former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, who also enjoyed shooting.

Mrs Bachmann has spoken of her love of guns before and said last Wednesday that she has an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association, reported Radio Iowa.

When she was a Minnesota senator the legislature passed a law to make it easier for those with only minimum requirements to get a gun permit.
