A historic pharmaceutical factory best known for being the home of cod liver oil is set to be transformed into a £80million 400-home garden village.

The former Wellcome factory in Dartford, Kent, which once employed 1,300 people, closed in 2008 after more than a century.

But now developers are turning the Mills Pond site into houses and apartments with prices ranging from £150,000.

The Wellcome Factory in 1900 in Dartford, Kent, which became best known for its production of cod liver oil and other pharmaceutical products 

The plant, pictured in 1931 was located close to the River Darent, where the raw materials to make their products was brought to the factory by barge 

The factory was wound down and closed in 2008 and now developers have bought the site, pictured now, to transform it into a 400-home garden village

The plant was famous for producing cod liver oil, malt and saccharin and supplied medicine chests to explorers, aviators and members of the royal family.

The Wellcome Pharmaceutical Factory was found by Henry Wellcome and Silas Burroughs in 1889 after it replaced the Pheonix Paper Mill, which was built on the site in 1852.

It became famous for producing cod liver oil and in its Edwardian heyday, the factory covered 33 acres of land, employing 1,300 people.

It relied on raw materials for its pharmaceutical products to be transported up the nearby River Darent by barge.

Famous explorers who carried Wellcome medicine chests prepared at the site include African pioneer, H M Stanley, Admiral Peary, the first person to reach the North Pole as well as Captain Amundsen, the first to reach the South Pole.

In its later years, it produced medicines including insulin for diabetics, migril which is used to treat migraines, zovirax, a cold sore treatment and retrovir tablets.

In its Edwardian heyday, the Wellcome Factory employed more than 1,300 staff. Pictured are female workers on the plant's packing floor

The packers at the site also produced medicine chest, which were given to several famous explorers as well as the royal family

The factory also employed sales reps to try and sell on their products. The reps are pictured outside Mansion House in Dartford in 1900 

After World War Two, the company opened newer plants on other sites and by 2008, the factory was wound down and then eventually closed by its then owners GlaxoSmithKlline.

Plans to regenerate the former factory's brownfield land Mill Ponds and neighbouring Northern Gateway sites begun in 2010.

Now Weston Homes has purchased the land and are set to redevelop the most historic part of the facility and transform it into a new garden village.

Chairman Bob Weston said: 'Our new £80 million garden village will transform surplus industrial land and bring it back to use as high quality residential housing and commercial premises.

'The Mill Pond and river setting will provide attractive water features for the adjoining homes and the leafy garden suburb inspired design will create a highly attractive place to live.

'It will be ideal for families and executives wanting a home within the M25 providing easy commuting into central London.'

Historians believe that the health benefits of cod liver oil were recognised as far back as the Viking era, when fisherman rubbed it into their joints to ease soreness.

By the 18th century, medics noted that the oil could be used to treat rheumatism, with the first recorded use of cod liver oil by a doctor in Manchester in 1782.

By the 1800s, it was officially recognised by doctors for its health benefits and it started to be used to treat a wide range of conditions.

These include gout, rickets, arthritis, those suffering from vitamin D deficiency and to help repair damaged teeth, skin, hair and nails.

By 1850, the process of extracting the oil from steaming cod livers was perfected, which led to a surge in its consumption and production.

The Wellcome Factory was one of the first to produce cod liver oil in tablet form.
