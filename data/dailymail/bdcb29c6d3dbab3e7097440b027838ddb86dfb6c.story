An Italian businessman who lost more than £19,000 after playing slot machines for 12 hours had to be sedated by paramedics after worried arcade staff called police.

The man, who has not been named by police, turned violent after losing the huge amount of money and accused staff of fixing the machines he was playing.

When police arrived at the arcade in Bergamo, northern Italy, they were unable to calm the man and were forced to call an ambulance was called to 
sedate him and remove him from the premises.

High stakes: The man began threatening and insulting staff at the arcade in Bergamo, Italy, after losing £19,000 on slot machines

The man had arrived at the arcade in with several bags of cash, telling staff he had just secured a 
successful deal and wanted to celebrate his luck.

Staff said he played casino style machines with a minimum 10 Euro (£8) bet for several hours and had racked up several wins before his luck started to turn and he began to lose.

As his money ran out he left the arcade only to return minutes later with more money that he said had been 'loaned' to him by friends but his losing streak continued and at around 3am when he had nothing left to gamble he began threatening and insulting staff.

They called police who tried to calm him down but when they failed to make any impact an ambulance was called to sedate him and take the man to a specialist dependency unit at Bergamo's local hospital.

A staff member said: ‘It's a very 
difficult situation - he has some issues so we would rather not make any
public comment although we have suggested a course of therapy.’

A Bergamo police spokesman said: ‘We were called to intervene at an incident at an arcade in the city where a customer had been playing slot machines for several hours. We understand that he'd lost a considerable amount of money and got quite upset. Officers were unable to calm him down and an ambulance was called to take him away once he had been sedated.’

Slot machine addiction is a growing social phenomenon in Italy with arcades springing up all across the country as hard up Italians try and stretch their wages through gambling and several regional medical authorties have reported a rise in treating those hooked.

In Britain earlier this month campaigners called for a £2 limit on slot machines but the government decided against any changes in the law as they was no evidence to suggest the terminals created serious problems.

Labour says streets are turning into a mini Las Vegas through the spread of the machines with some punters losing hundeds of pounds an hour and turning on staff as a result.
