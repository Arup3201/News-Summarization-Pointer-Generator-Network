A baby was killed by a falling lamppost days after a construction worker inadvertently cut through its foundations.

Engineer Kelvin Elmore – a father himself – said he wished he could ‘take the child’s place’ after learning of his role in the death of Tommy Hollis.

The little boy suffered fatal head injuries shortly before his first birthday when the metal pole toppled and struck him while he slept in his pushchair.

Tragic: Tommy Hollis died a day before his first birthday after a workman mistook the post for a tramline and cut it outside London's Chiswick Town Hall in February 2010

Happy family: Tommy laughs for a photo shoot with his mother, Kate, and 
father, Chris. They attended the hearing, although Mrs Hollis left the 
courtroom when details of her son's injuries were read out.

His parents have called for ‘answers’ over the tragedy, adding: ‘We don’t want any other family to go through what we’ve gone through.’

Yesterday, an inquest at West London Coroner’s Court heard that Mr Elmore had cut through the lamppost’s steel foundation during a project to widen the road.

He told the court: ‘As a father myself,  I cannot express how horrified I am to have had any involvement with the death of a child. If I could take the place of that child, I would.’

Mr Elmore was part of a team moving cables in the ground outside Chiswick town hall in West London on February 18, 2010.

He was attempting to clear obstacles when he came across a section of steel and presumed it to be an old tram line.

He tried to cut through the metal with a steel cutter but found it was attached to concrete and decided to leave it.

It later emerged that it was part of the foundations for the lamppost, which stood 18in from where he tried to cut the steel.

He said: ‘I had believed the piece of steel to be part of a tram line and had no idea it was connected to the lamppost.

‘Had I known that, I would not have continued to work in the vicinity of the lamppost myself.’

Five days later, on February 23, the lamppost fell, fatally injuring Tommy and hitting 62-year-old grandmother Mary Gregory in the lower back.

A pathologist recorded the cause of the baby’s death as ‘severe impact head injury’. Mr Elmore told the inquest that in 17 years in his job, he had never seen a lamppost with such unusual foundations.

He also said that the council had already dug up the road and had not informed him that the lamppost had a piece of steel welded on to it.

He added: ‘I was surprised and shocked at how the lamppost had been modified to anchor it to the ground.’

He also said that he had ‘no idea’ his actions had made the lamppost unstable.

Mr Elmore was found guilty of gross misconduct by employers McNicholas and given a written warning, but was allowed to continue working for the company.

Yesterday, Tommy’s mother Kate, 40, a senior legal counsel at finance firm GE Capital, and her husband Christopher, 42, a pilot, said they still wanted ‘answers’.

Helping others: Mr and Mrs Hollis had another son, Jack, in September. They have set up a charity in Tommy's name to 'give loving care to children, in particular those without parents'

Mrs Hollis added: ‘We still find it incredibly difficult to believe it happened. We waited a long time to have Tommy. He was extra special. He was just a happy, smiley boy who spread joy wherever he went. The reality is it could have been any child.’

The couple, whose have an eight-month-old son called Jack, have set up a charity in Tommy’s memory to raise money for a number of children’s causes.

Tommy’s nanny Anna Martin told the inquest how she tried to resuscitate him after the lamppost fell. She said he was asleep in his pushchair as they strolled from his parents’ house in Chiswick towards a branch of Starbucks for a coffee.

In a statement, she added: ‘I took one hand off the pushchair handles to check the traffic lights.

‘The next thing I remember was  a loud noise which sounded  like something hollow hitting  something.’ She said she pulled  the pushchair back instinctively and realised that Tommy was not moving.

A police officer removes the pram from the scene: Anna Martin said she was wheeling the sleeping toddler past roadworks when she heard a 'hollow' noise followed by a 'terrible scream'

Respect: A couple look at flowers laid at the scene. Nanny Miss Martin tried to revive the little boy with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation but he never regained consciousness

She added: ‘I took him out of his pushchair and saw a long piece of metal that looked like a pipe.

‘I didn’t know what was wrong, but his eyes were closed and he looked like he was sleeping, which worried me. I shouted for help.’

She tried to resuscitate him but he had fallen into an ‘instantaneous coma’ and was airlifted to the Royal London Hospital, where he died two days later.

She said she was always ‘really careful’ around the area because it ‘wasn’t safe’ with all the workmen.

Dominic Long, an inspector for the Health and Safety Executive, said that up to 10 per cent of lampposts had ‘hybrid column’ foundations like the one Mr Elmore cut through. Another expert told the inquest that Mr Elmore should have realised the steel was connected to the lamppost.

Asked whether there was any indication that the two were joined, engineer Clive Lane said: ‘Only its closeness. I think one hopes you would trace the steel back to see where it goes.’ The inquest continues.
