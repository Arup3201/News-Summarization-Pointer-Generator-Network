According to the Sheriff's office: 'On March 20 at approximately 9pm Franklin County received a 911 call in reference to a father and son falling off of White Rock Mountain. 

'Dispatch sent four deputies to the scene, North and South Franklin County EMS Crews, Franklin County Office of Emergency Services, and PV 1st Responders. 

'Upon arrival Deputy Justin Oliver and Mason Berry made there way around a slick trail and found the safest and quickest way to the injured parties at the base of a 100 ft rock face. Regrettably the father was found to be deceased, but the 8 year old male was alive, though seriously injured.
