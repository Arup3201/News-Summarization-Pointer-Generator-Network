Robbie Keane has told the Republic of Ireland to forget the nightmares they have suffered at the hands of Germany in the recent past as they attempt to take the biggest of scalps.

Ireland conceded nine goals, six of them on one horrific night the Aviva Stadium, and scored only once in reply during the last World Cup qualifying campaign, with the Germans running riot on their way to glory in Brazil.

However, as he prepared to lock horns with Joachim Low's men once again in Euro 2016 qualifying battle in Gelsenkirchen on Tuesday evening, Keane insisted all that was history.

The 34-year-old Republic skipper said: 'To be honest with you, I don't think the players are thinking too much about what happened in the past. We have to concentrate on what we are doing now.

'We are certainly a different team than we were a few years ago. The players certainly haven't mentioned it this week, and they shouldn't be, to be honest with you.

'It's a completely different game, and we're going into this game on a good run and with a lot of confidence.

'These games, you have to go and enjoy it. You have seen the stadium here - it's absolutely fantastic. These are games that any player wants to be involved in. You are playing against one of the best teams in the world - go out and enjoy it.

'As long as you know what your jobs are and stick to that, go out and give it a go because you are playing against the World Cup champions.

'We have players in this squad who are very, very comfortable in what they are doing at club level, and they and can bring it on to the international stage, there's no question.

'In the last two games, we have got some great results, so we are clearly confident that we can come here and get something out of the game.'

The two sides will run out at the Veltins Stadium in contrasting moods, with Germany desperate to bounce back from a shock Group D defeat in Poland on Saturday a few hours after Ireland trounced Gibraltar 7-0 in Dublin to maintain a 100 per cent start to their campaign.

Manager Martin O'Neill knows the respective challenges represented by the two opponents could hardly be more different, and, while the approach will undoubtedly change, he is hoping the basics will not.

O'Neill said: 'I don't think Germany will allow us the same sort of space to play in. But we are obviously going to encounter many different problems during the game. The Germans are world champions and they have a habit of qualifying for competitions.

'We have our own plan. I can't turn around say, 'Stick to plans'. Best-laid plans can disappear after five minutes in a match.

'We are going with some confidence into the game. If we are pressed back, then okay, but if we deliberately sit in, then Germany will eventually pick you off

'We want to try to attack as well. It's a game to relish. It's one where we want to go out and do something about the game, not just let the game disappear.'

Germany coach Low made a point of mentioning Ireland's fighting spirit during his own pre-match press conference, and O'Neill was not at all put out by it.

He said: 'I understand that - he's got a fair amount of fight in own team too. I wouldn't decry those attributes - in fact, I am quite pleased that he would mention those.

GERMANY (prob, 4-4-2): Neuer; Rudiger, Boateng, Hummels, Durm; Draxler, Kroos, Bellarabi, Schurrle; Gotze, Muller.

REPUBLIC OF IRELAND (prob, 4-5-1): Forde; Meyler, O'Shea, Wilson, Ward; Walters, Whelan, Gibson, Quinn, McGeady; Keane.

REFEREE: Damir Skomina (Slv).

TV: LIVE on Sky Sports 5 from 7pm (kick-off 7.45).

'We are deficient in certain things, but a bit of fighting spirit, I think, pervades the team and that can help. It will not win you every single game you play in, but it's a grand start.'

Anything other than victory for the home side would represent another significant surprise, although O'Neill does not believe Poland's heroics have changed the face of the group.

He added: 'I think when the 10 games are played, Germany will find themselves in front in the group. They usually do, and I still think they are the best team in it.
