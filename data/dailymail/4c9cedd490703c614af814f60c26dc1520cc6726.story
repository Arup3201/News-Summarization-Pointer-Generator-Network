A heart-wrenching video has been made which shows volunteers who have agreed to work over Christmas Day being rewarded with gifts.

Financial firm Visa Europe delivered a series of gifts to street cleaners at Hounslow Council, midwives at Whittington Hospital Maternity Ward, baggage handlers at Southend Airport and food bank volunteers at the North Paddington food bank.

Among them was 82-year-old Brenda Meadows, who has been volunteering for 65 years and worked every Christmas Day at the food bank for the past 30 years.

Brenda Meadows, 82, has been volunteering for 65 years and worked every Christmas Day at the North Paddington food bank in London for the past 30 years.

Ms Meadows hasn’t seen her family in Australia for 15 years. She was given £2,000 gift voucher to pay for her flights home.

The present was accompanied by a note that said: ‘Thank you for a lifetime of giving.’

Ms Meadow said: ‘I don’t have any family left in the UK so the community is my family now. To me it’s important to give because you are making other people happy.’

One worker was given a Samsung Galaxy tablet, while another was presented with two tickets to the PGA Championship golf tournament at Wentworth golf course.

One baggage handler opened a box containing a 60-minute flying lesson at Southend Flying Club.

Up to 200,000 people across the UK are expected to work on Christmas Day this year.

According to latest figures released by the Trades Union Congress, the national trade union centre in the UK, almost 172,000 employees were in work on Christmas Day in 2010, compared to just over 96,000 in 2004.

NHS and social workers make up the largest group, with over 74,000 people working on 25th December.

While there has been an increase in the number of people working over Christmas, Visa have now forecast that up to £1,800 will be donated every minute this month.

They have predicted that a total of £1 billion will be pledged to charity by the end of 2014, up from £920m in 2013.

The financial firm revealed that donations sent through Visa Europe are up by 13 percent from last year.

Nick Jones, Head of Corporate Social Responsibility at Visa Europe, said: 'Our Christmas video is intended to help recognise and thank those who will be working to help others over the festive period. 

'Supporting good causes and our local community is something that’s important to us as an organisation, and this "Christmas thank you" represents just one small part of our wider Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and volunteering programme.

'In 2014 our 1800 employees selected Save the Children as our chosen charity for employee fundraising, and we are proud to be able to support their work and help make a positive difference to vulnerable children all over the world.'
