Jailed: Cynical con artist David Bowerman, 35, from Chelmsford, Essex,  swindled up to £7.5 million from investors including terminally ill cancer patients through a massive Ponzi scheme

A cynical con artist who swindled up to £7.5 million from investors including terminally ill cancer patients through a massive Ponzi scheme has been jailed.

David Bowerman, 35, from Chelmsford, Essex, enjoyed a lavish lifestyle as he blew a fortune on fast cars, luxury holidays and a toxic gambling habit after investors pumped millions of pounds into his bogus scheme.

More than 250 people were taken in by the intricate con including Manchester City ace Richard Wright, 35, who handed over £400,000.

Bowerman blew investors' cash on three Caribbean cruises and a whole host of flashy cars including a £38k Audi sports car, a BMW and an Aston Martin.

The charismatic con man - who was seen lighting cigarettes with a £50 note - even stole £36,500 from his own mother, Cynthia Bowerman, to fund his affluent lifestyle.

He eventually handed himself in to police in August 2010 as his debts mounted and demands for repayment from frustrated investors became unbearable.

Bowerman did not react as he was sentenced to eight years in prison at Chelmsford Crown Court today.

The former investment advisor wore a grey suit and stared emotionlessly from the dock as the court heard a harrowing list of his many victims.

The list included two terminally ill cancer sufferers who invested in the scheme in the hope of leaving their loved ones with money after they died.

Other victims lost their life savings or pension pots they had worked for years to amass resulting in problems with stress, depression and suicidal thoughts.

The court heard it is unlikely any investor in the scheme will ever be refunded.

Judge Charles Gratwicke said: 'You acted in a totally wicked, disgraceful and cynical manner without any regard for the effects of your dishonesty on those who trusted you.

'Over the five-year period you quite clearly engaged in multiple acts of dishonesty obtaining something in the region of £7.5m.

'There must clearly be a substantial prison sentence to reflect the effect it had on your victims.'

The Ponzi scheme worked by offering existing investors money from new investors to give the impression of a profit-making business.

Bowerman began in early 2005 by selling fake bonds and offering loans under the pretence his experience as an FSA-approved financial advisor would help boost their credit rating.

Records show that the charismatic crook blew vast amounts of his investors' cash with unsuccessful betting sprees at online websites such as www.bet365.com.

Ironically - despite his woeful record with online betting - Bowerman then set up an online bookmaker called Shearer Hare and encouraged friends and family to invest heavily in it - using the funds to give the impression of a profit-making business.

The business generated £4.85m but £3.8m soon disappeared through online betting by Bowerman with an unknown amount being blown on his increasingly lavish lifestyle.

Antony Swift, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant systematically and cynically defrauded family, friends and acquaintances out of large sums of money.

'The total sum is in excess of £7 million.

'He raised funds in order to feed an insatiable gambling habit.

'It was characteristic of the defendant's offending that he would keep going back to get as much as he could off his victims.'

The court heard that nearing the end of Bowerman's five-year con he began targeting big money earners as his debts mounted.

Mr Swift continued: 'His victims included the footballer Richard Wright, Manchester City goalkeeper, and Peter Stroud, former chairman of Chelmsford City football club.

'These people had large amounts of cash at their disposal.

'The defendant needed large amounts of cash to keep his various balls in the air so he persuaded them to invest in separate schemes.

'He was telling them there was a particular betting syndicate guaranteed to make money and large returns - but the returns never came.'

Peter Stroud, 46, the former chairman of FA Cup giant-killers Chelmsford City Football Club, was one of Bowerman's biggest victims after handing over more than £1 million to the former mortgage advisor.

The father-of-four said: 'I hope he dies in prison.

'The impact he has had on so many lives is unbelievable. It has had a massive impact on my family.'I trusted him implicitly.

'He worked for a good company and I had known him for ten years. He was charismatic and flamboyant but what he did, he did with malice.

'He did it to buy himself an Aston Martin and there were pictures of him on Facebook lighting his cigarette with a £50 note he had set fire to.

'That is what a fraudster does and, looking back, I realise there were small signs and I have blamed myself.

'He took over a million pounds from me. I was wealthy and had a good life, the money I gave him was to pay off the mortgage on a new house in Little Waltham and pay off my ex-wife's mortgage.

'You just can't imagine the impact it had. I don't get a good night's sleep now. I get up at 4am.'I had to sell my business and am selling off a home in Cornwall.

'My children were used to a dad who had money and now when they want an ice cream I have to say no.

'There was a moment when I thought everyone would be better off without me, but things are improving now and I have a new company which is doing well.

'It will just be about working hard and in a few years I hope to look back and see this as an experience.'

Bowerman had pleaded guilty to 33 charges of fraud - including 17 offences of fraud by false representation, 14 offences of obtaining money transfer by deception, one of theft and one of participation in a company on a fraudulent basis - when he appeared at an earlier hearing at Chelmsford Crown Court in September 2012.

Christopher Kerr, mitigating, today told the court of his client's 'deep shame' over his actions.

He said: 'He does express deep shame and remorse for he did.

'He is very aware of the very great loss, both financial and emotional, he has caused.

'It is clear the offences were the result of a chronic and acute gambling addiction.

'He did believe he could turn all of this around by gambling. He accepts that that belief was thoroughly deluded and without foundation.

'It was not his intent to cause a loss.'

The court was told that, since handing himself in August 2010 and being released on bail, Bowerman has undergone intensive treatment for gambling addiction and has begun lobbying parliament to regulate the gambling industry.

He has helped set up a campaign group called Gambling Reform and Society Perception (GRASP) and has contributed towards BBC and Channel 4 documentaries on the subject.

BBC presenter Alexis Conran praised Bowerman for being 'instrumental' in helping put together BBC3 documentary 'Gambling Addiction and Me: The Real Hustler' in a character reference read out in court.

He added: 'I am very sure he has helped many gambling addicts and their families avoid ruin.'

Detective Constable Peter Sutton, from the Kent and Essex Fraud Squad, said: 'David Bowerman's criminality touched the lives of over 250 people and netted him in excess of £7.5 million.

'Some of his victims suffered more than once as he continued to abuse their trust whilst he fraudulently raised funds to feed his insatiable appetite for gambling and to finance a lavish lifestyle way beyond his legitimate means.

'The cynical way in which Bowerman exploited the trust of his victims is the worst example seen by the case office in over 28 years of police service.

'Bowerman has caused considerable hardship and loss to his victims from which many are likely never to be able to recover.'
