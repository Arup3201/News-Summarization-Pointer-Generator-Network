Bulgarian and Romanian workers will go to other European countries when an immigration ban is relaxed at the beginning of next year, leading politicians from the two countries said today.

Bulgarian foreign minister Nikolay Mladenov said many of his compatriots would much rather travel to Germany, Spain and Italy, as his country has stronger business links with those countries.

He said there was a danger that fears about thousands of immigrants descending on the UK could 'dampen' relations with Bulgaria.

Romanian ambassador to the UK, Dr Ion Jinga, said many immigrants had already by-passed the restrictions by declaring themselves self-employed and finding jobs in sectors such as construction.

The two men were interviewed by Dermot Murnaghan on Sky News amid fears that when the ban preventing immigrants from the two countries working in the UK comes to an end at the beginning of next year, thousands will arrive and look for jobs.

Bulgaria and Romania joined the European Union in 2007 but under 'transitional arrangements' workers from the two countries were prevented from travelling to the UK.

Mr Mladenov said the relaxing of the restrictions would not lead to a flood of immigrants coming here.

He said: 'I do not expect the UK to be overwhelmed by a wave of our nationals coming over seeking employment for a number of reasons.

'When we look at the experience of other countries over the last seven years, this has not happened and there is no reason to believe that this would happen in the UK in the January of next year.

'We have not seen since Bulgaria's accession to the European Union mass waves of Bulgarians moving across Europe and seeking illegal rights or illegal immigration to other countries.

'We had some issues in the first days after accession but in a number of cases we acted very swiftly and they were addressed, and so there were no lasting concerns.

'The UK would not be the primary 
country of choice for many people to go and work. Our economy is mostly 
connected to the German economy.

'We
have a large number of companies working in places like Spain and 
Italy, where we have long-standing traditions and where the labour 
market had opened to Bulgarians quite some time ago.

'I really don't believe that there is a need to have these fearful debates that are happening.

'On
the contrary, I think people in the United Kingdom, given your history,
must understand that immigration has always been beneficial to your 
economy, just as Britain's membership of the European Union has been 
beneficial to not only jobs creation but prosperity in your country.'

Meanwhile a diplomatic row has broken out after Britain made public last week plans to warn off Romanian migrants.

It emerged the government is considering launching a campaign in Romania and Bulgaria to put people off coming to the UK.

But the Romanian foreign minister has said restrictions on its citizens to work in the UK has caused 'serious concern.'

Dr Jinga said fears that many Romanians would come to the UK was a 'false problem'.

He said: 'Romanians' immigration pattern is not towards the UK but towards Spain, Italy and France, for instance because of the language proximity, Romanian being a Latin language.

'We have one million Romanians already living and working in Spain, one million in Italy, probably half a million in France."

He added: 'Those Romanians who have wanted to come to Britain, they have already done it.'There are some restrictions for some areas of activities but no visa requirements, so those who have wanted to come, they have done it.

'It is always a possibility to find a job, even if it is under restrictions, and that solution is to declare yourself self-employed, and many Romanians have done so.

'For instance in the construction sector, there are many Romanians here and that is why your Olympic village was built up last year.'

New data shows the proportion of people across who say English is not their main language  ranging from 0.7 per cent in Redcar and Cleveland to 41.4 per cent in Newham in London.

The breakdown from the 2011 national census also revealed the second most commonly  spoken language in the country is now Polish.

Polish was virtually unheard on the streets of Britain a decade ago but its use has soared since the country joined the EU in May 2004.

The census figures show that other Eastern European languages are  now in the list of the most popular, including Lithuanian, spoken by 85,000 people, and Latvian, first  language of 32,000.

Romanian and Bulgarian are other languages that can be heard – a year before citizens of Romania and  Bulgaria are allowed access to the UK  in the same way they have been to Poles since 2004.

Romanian is the first language of 68,000 people in England and Wales, and Bulgarian of 38,000 people.
