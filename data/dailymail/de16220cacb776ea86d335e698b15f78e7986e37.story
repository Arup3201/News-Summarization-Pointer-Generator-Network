A golden retriever is recovering after having emergency surgery to remove 16 rocks from his stomach.

The seven-year-old dog found the river rocks in his garden and quickly gobbled them up - but then had to be rushed to a vets in Eden Prairie, Minnesota.

His owners first noticed something was wrong on Tuesday night, when the husband asked his wife: 'Does Gordon's stomach look big to you?'

The following morning, they realized he had a serious problem when he tried to pass the first rock.

His worried owners, who have asked not to be identified, rushed Gordon to Blue Pearl Vets, where an X-ray revealed the pile of rubble in his belly.

Gordon then had to have a two-hour operation to clear the rocks, which weighed 1.79lb, from his stomach.

'Dogs eat a lot of different things. Usually they would eat only one or two rocks,' James Judge, from Blue Pearl Veterinary Partners, told Mail Online.

'I saw an X-ray of a dog that ate a fork once, that was pretty amazing,' he added.

Gordon's owners did not see him eat the rocks, but they believe he found them in their garden. They told the vets they were surprised at what was seen on his X-ray because he always has food available.

Dr Jeff Yu, who performed the operation, 
said: 'You don't see too many dogs that eat this many rocks usually. 
Most dogs will stop after one or two, but Gordon certainly had 
quite the hankering for some rocks.'

Mr Judge said that dogs will sometimes eat rocks, especially if they are under a barbecue, where food has dripped down.

The cost of the operation has not been revealed but surgery can cost up to a couple of thousand pounds, Mr Judge said.

He added that Gordon's unexpected experience was a perfect example of why pet insurance can be so valuable.

Despite his uncomfortable ordeal Gordon is making a good recovery and is expected to go home tomorrow.

'He is still at the hospital but he is wagging his tail and eager to see his owners,' Mr Judge said.
