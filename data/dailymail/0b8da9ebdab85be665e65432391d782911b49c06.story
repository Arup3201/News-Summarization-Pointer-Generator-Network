Survivor: Leon Leyson was the youngest Jewish survivor of the Holocaust spared by being on Schindler's List. Oskar Schindler kept an eye on the Leyson family among the hundreds of other Jews he saved.

The youngest Jewish refugee to be saved from the Holocaust by Oskar Schindler has died.

Leon Leyson, 83, was just 13 when he was taken on as a Schindler employee, he went on to live in Los Angeles, served in the U.S. army and worked as a teacher in industrial arts - keen to give something back to his adoptive country.

Living in Krakow, he was 10 when the Nazis invaded Poland. Jews were forced to live in a ghetto but Leyon's father, Morris was one of the few men allowed out to work, NBC News reports.

He was fortunate to have Oskar Schindler as his boss, a native German shocked by the horrors he saw committed by the Nazis and determined to try and save as many Jews as he could.  

In 1943, Schindler was granted permission to keep his workers in his own factory sub-camp. He secretly brought them more food and enabled them to live in conditions never permitted by the Nazis.

Among them was the Leyson family, a family of seven who had moved to Krakow so Morris could find work.

Because of Schindler's interventions and after being ultimately placed on his list of workers which meant they were save from the death camps, Leon survived alongside his parents and an older brother and sister.

His other two brothers were killed.

'Five of us survived the war, this is the bottom line, out of everyone who was related to me in Poland. And we survived because we were on Schindler's list,' Leon said during an interview in 2008 on NBC4.

The family moved to the U.S. in 1949.

Leyson built up a good relationship with Schindler, who risked his life hiring hundreds of extra Jewish workers during the war, to save them.

Leyson was too small to operate the 
machines properly in Schindler's factory so he stood on an upturned box,
 Schindler called him Little Leyson.

'Occasionally, when he was by himself, he would come and talk to me. He ordered that I get extra rations of food,' Leyson said.

When the Nazis ordered the remaining Jews of Krakow to be sent to Auschwitz., Schindler acted again paying huge bribes and using all of his influence to ensure as many as possible were relocated to outside home town and thus away from the Final Solution.

Schindler also dramatically intervened when Leyson's mother and sister were among 300 Schindler women accidentally re-routed to Auschwitz when they were meant to be being led to safety.

They knew the gas chambers awaited them until they heard Schindler's voice.

'What are you doing with these people? These are my people,' he told the Nazi guards, who let them go after Schindler offered further bribes.

Leyon didn't talk about his wartime experiences until 1993 and Steven Spielberg's acclaimed film Schindler's List prompted him to share his story.

He went on to take part in an educational program where Holocaust survivors spoke in high schools and college campuses providing a personal testimony of the horrors committed by Hitler's Nazi party.

He often told stories of his beloved brother Tsalig, who at 16, chose to go to a death camp with his girlfriend rather than accept Schindler's offer to save him - he didn't want her to be alone.

The young couple was murdered.

Leyson once met Schindler in the U.S. many years on and found that he still remembered him.  

'I know who you are. You are little Leyson!,' he said.

Leyson worked as a teacher at Huntington Park High School, Los Angeles for 39 years.

He lived in Fullerton with his wife, Liz, and had two children.
