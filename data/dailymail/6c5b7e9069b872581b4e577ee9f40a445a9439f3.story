Prince Philip put in a youthful appearance at the Royal Windosr Horse Show today despite his advancing age

He may be about to celebrate his 93rd birthday but Prince Philip clearly isn’t a man to slow down.

The Iron Duke was out carriage driving yesterday in Windsor Great Park - with the energy of someone half his age.

Like his wife, the Queen, who still rides regularly at the age of 88, Philip has refused to give up the sport he loves.

He has always been a keen sportsman, taking up carriage driving in 1971 when he officially retired from playing polo - believing it was the perfect sport for someone in ‘middle age’.

By 1973 he was suitably proficient to take up the sport competitively, representing Britain at several European and World Championships.

He continued to compete in four-in-hand carriage driving with his team of Fell ponies into his early 80s and still enjoys the sport recreationally.

In his book ‘Thirty Years On and Off The Box Seat’ the Duke described the appeal of the sport, saying: ‘I am getting old, my reactions are getting slower, and my memory is unreliable, but I have never lost the sheer pleasure of driving a team through the British countryside.

‘I have been fortunate to have had a longer innings than most, and I have no intention of giving up while I have a team of willing ponies and dedicated staff and while I can still cope with the challenges which carriage driving presents me with.’

Unstoppable: Royal aides have admitted it is difficult to persuade the prince to slow down

He took up carriage driving in 1971 after retiring from polo and competed in it from 1973 onwards

In 2010 he escaped major injury following a carriage driving accident - while a female groom less than half his age had to be taken to hospital.

The prince was out driving in the grounds at Windsor Castle when the ponies pulling his carriage were startled and bolted.

As a result the carriage hit a tree stump, jolting the occupants and leaving the Queen’s husband with ‘a minor injury’ to his ankle.

Sources said he refused to see a doctor or go to hospital and by the afternoon of the same day was ‘out and about’ in the gardens again.

Meanwhile the young female groom, who has not been named, was taken to hospital for an x-ray on an injury to her elbow.

In 2010 the prince was nearly injured after the horses hitched to a carriage his was driving spooked and bolted

The accident ended with a female groom being taken to hospital, but Philip escaped with a 'minor ankle injury' and according to sources was back out in the gardens by the afternoon

In recent years, the prince has suffered several bouts of ill-health, however, the most serious of which was over Christmas 2011 when he was rushed into hospital for emergency heart surgery after suffering a blocked artery, which involved him having a stent fitted

He was also forced to pull out of several key engagements to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012 having developed a severe bladder infection after being forced to stand for hours in driving wind and rain during a celebratory river pageant.

He also spent his birthday - June 10 - last year in hospital after undergoing an ‘exploratory’ operation for unexplained abdominal pain. The results of the tests have never been released.

Yet aides have admitted it is difficult to persuade Philip to slow down, with one saying: ‘No one would ever dare tell him to take it easy - you might as well take your life in your hands.’

‘The Duke cannot bear anyone making a fuss. ‘

Aides said Philip had been out and about in the days before the horse show speaking with stall owners

As well as taking a carriage for a spin, the prince was on hand to dish out awards, such as in the Driving for the Disabled class (pictured)

Philip is already the longest-serving consort in British history and the oldest serving partner of a reigning monarch.

In an interview to mark his 90th birthday with the BBC, the outspoken Duke said he favoured discrimination against older people as ‘you go downhill’ later in life.

He also admitted he was reducing his own workload before he reaches his ‘sell-by date’.

‘There is an ageism in this country, as everywhere, and quite rightly so, because I think you go downhill - physically, mentally and everything,’ he said.

‘I reckon I’ve done my bit, I want to enjoy myself for a bit now. With less responsibility, less rushing about, less preparation, less trying to think of something to say.’

One royal aide said yesterday that Philip had been out and about at Windsor in recent days, helping the Queen to prepare for the annual Royal Windsor Horse Show.

‘The Duke is not competing but he is, as always, continuing to take great interest in the RWHS. He has been out and a about checking on the arrangements and meeting stallholders,’ they said.
