The former wife of NBA star Dwyane Wade is in the midst of an apparent meltdown as she has taken to the streets of Chicago carrying a sign saying the Miami Heat guard has left her homeless and ranting about his '$90 million contracts' in an apparent attempt to humiliate him.

Wade's former bride, Siohvaughn Funches, has been seen carrying the sign, which reads 'NBA Miami Heat star mother of his children on the street,' around Wade's native Chicago, where he and Funches were high school sweethearts and married in 2002.

Wedded bliss didn't last, though, and the couple divorced in 2007 after having two children together, Zaire Blessing Dwyane Wade and Zion Malachi Airamis Wade.

Earlier this month, Funches filed a new lawsuit against Wade - who signed a six-year contract with the Heat in 2010 worth $107 million - over the splitting of proceeds from his many endorsement deals.

With his salary and endorsements, Wade made a total of $26 million last year, landing him at the number 12 spot on Sports Illustrated's 'Fortunate 50' list of the top earners in professions sports.

The lawsuit, filed on July 9, in Cook County Circuit Court, claims that Wade is not depositing proceeds from his endorsement deals into a joint account controlled by the two of them - as required by their 2008 divorce settlement.

That agreement had previously been tossed out in domestic court following the couple's bitter custody battle. It was later restored after Funches appealed the decision.

In the suit, Funches claims she's unable to pay her mortgage and insurance on her home and cars because Wade's withheld his endorsement earnings from companies like Gatorade, T-Mobil and Staples.

Following the couples' divorce, Wade was awarded sole custody of the two children as Funches routinely bashed him in the media.

Funches' latest lawsuit against the hoopster claims breach of contract and civil conspiracy. She seeks a total of $2 million in damages.

Wade, who just won the NBA Championship with the Heat, has been romantically linked to actress Gabrielle Union since 2007.
