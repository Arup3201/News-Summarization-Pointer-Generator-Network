A group of thugs viciously attacked a journalist and left her in a ditch after they followed her down a motorway in Ukraine.

Civic activist Tetyana Chornovol was targeted by the thugs while she was driving outside Kyiv, Ukraine, in the early hours of Christmas Day.

The men tailed the 34-year-old and began to ram her vehicle as she tried to get away.

But the group managed to push her car over to the side of the road where they dragged her out and savagely beat her.

After the terrifying incident, which was captured on a camera installed on the car's dashboard, Chornovol could not call the police because she could barely talk.

Later in the day, police say they identified three suspects and took two of them into custody over the crime.

It is the latest in a string of attacks against journalists and civic activists who have condemened the government.

According to police, Chornovol was driving home to the village of Gora when around 1:30 a.m. her car was blocked by a sport utility car with unknown men inside.

Chornovol tried to turn back, but her car was pushed to the side of the road. After she stopped the car, the men dragged Chornovol out and savagely beat her. After that, the men left Chornovol in the car and pushed it into a roadside ditch.

She was taken to a hospital in Boryspil of Kyiv Oblast where another video captured her writhing in pain before she went into surgery.

In the clip published on YouTube, in
 a hospital bed, the battered Chornovol says, 'They didn't say anything.
 They were just beating.' 

Oblast's press service, told the Kyiv Post. 'Someone saw that her car stood on the road and called the traffic police,' he said 

According to journalist and activist Mustafa Nayyem, Chornovol suffered a concussion and injuries to her face in the beating by a group of men.

President Viktor Yanukovych's press service released a statement on Christmas Day saying that the president condemned this act of violence and ordered Prosecutor General Viktor Pshonka and Interior Minister Vitaliy Zakharchenko to do everything to solve the case of Chornovol's beating.

The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv condemned the attack
 on Chornovol in the statement and called for an investigation, 'which unlike previous such incidents must 
result in those responsible being held fully accountable under the law.'

On
 Christmas Eve right before the beating, Chornovol posted a blog about a
 house being constructed outside Kyiv that allegedly belongs to Interior
 Minister Zakharchenko.
