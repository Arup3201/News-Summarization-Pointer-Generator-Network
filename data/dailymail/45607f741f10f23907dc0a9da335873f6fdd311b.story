Ugandan police have arrested a man they suspect supplied fake drugs to Australian miner Christopher Kirkman, who was found dead in his Ugandan hotel room on Wednesday.

Mr Kirkman was in transit in Entebbe, near the Ugandan capital Kampala, after he missed a connecting flight to Australia. He had been working in the Democratic Republic of Congo with Australian gold mining company, Byrnecut, since February 2013. 

It is believed he had gone out for a drink with a fellow Australian on Wednesday and collapsed later in his hotel room.

Ugandan Police say initial investigations indicate Christopher Kirkman died from a drug overdose after being supplied with fake drugs

Ugandan metropolitan police spokesman Patrick Onyango said that preliminary investigations indicated Mr Kirkman died of a drug overdose and that he suffered from hypertension. 

The other Australian man was reportedly rushed to Entebbe hospital after he also collapsed, but police say that man was recovering after treatment. 

'We have arrested one man who is alleged to have supplied the drugs to the Australian men,' the spokesman said. 

'The one who was taken to hospital is out of danger. We are still carrying out our investigations.'

Police suspect the supplied drugs were fake.

Mr Kirkman had posted on Facebook on Wednesday that he was tired after missing his flight. 

'Well that was an extremely long day, missed the connecting flight so looks like a big night tonight!' he posted on his Facebook wall. 

He had previously posted about flight delays from another Ugandan airport. 

A post-mortem will be conducted to determine the cause of death.

Duncan Bradford, Managing Director of Byrnecut, told the media Christopher had worked for the company since February 2013 and was in transit for his rostered leave in Australia. 

'Byrnecut Offshore is in close contact with DFAT, local Ugandan authorities and Chris’s family and will assist with the repatriation of Chris’s body to Australia,' he said. 

Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was providing consular assistance to the family of a 30-year-old Western Australian man who died in Uganda.
