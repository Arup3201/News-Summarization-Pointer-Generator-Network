'Significant numbers' of older people could run out of money when new pensions reforms are introduced in April

'Significant numbers' of older people could run out of money when new pensions reforms are introduced in April.

In less three months' time, thousands of over-55s will be able to withdraw their pension pots for the first time under plans to allow people to use their retirement savings more like a bank account.

Traditionally, retirees had to use their pension pot to buy an annuity – a guaranteed income for life.

But analysis for Age UK reveals that the freedoms could leave many penniless within a decade of retiring if they are unable to budget effectively and end up blowing the lot.

The charity has called on the Government to put more safeguards in place to prevent scores of older people having to fall back on to the State pension after burning through their nest egg too quickly.

In its new report, entitled Dashboards and Jam Jars, it calculated that if someone withdrew £3,000 a year from the age of 65 from a £29,000 pension pot, paying three per cent in annual interest, they would run out of money by the time they were 75.

Even if returns on their remaining savings were 5 per cent, withdrawing £3,000 a year would still mean they ran out of savings just a year later, at 76.

Taking just £2,000 a year would still only last them until the age of 81.

But with an average life expectancy for 65-year-olds of 83 for men and 85 for women, even modest annual withdrawals would leave 'a significant number of pensioners risk having to survive for several years at the end of their lives without any income from their private pensions', Age UK said.

The report claimed: 'For many this will mean life will become financially much tougher with some struggling to make ends meet.'

A 0.75 per cent cap on management and administration fees will be brought in from April on auto-enrolled workplace schemes, but will not apply to all pensions.

The charity has now called for improved quality standards for pension firms and charge caps on income drawdown products.

The report calculated that a £29,000 pension pot with a 2 per cent set-up charge and a high 2 per cent annual management fee, with £150 a year admin costs, would provide £11,000 less income than a product with a cap of 0.75 per cent.

Age UK called for better money management tools for older people so they avoid running out of money too quickly and quality standards on products likely to be introduced as a result of the changes.

Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK said: 'We welcome people having more flexibility in how to use their pension savings.

'But that makes it even more important that we fully understand the implications and consequences of our financial decisions and can trust the financial services in which we have invested.

'That's why we believe that there must be additional checks and balances introduced to the pensions legislation in addition to the impartial guidance that will be available.

'This is too important to leave to chance.'

They also called for better protection against pension liberation scams, which encourage people to take their money out prematurely, incurring large fines.
