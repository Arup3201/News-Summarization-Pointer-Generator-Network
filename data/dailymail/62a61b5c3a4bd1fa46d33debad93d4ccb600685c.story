A drunken woman was arrested after police say she forced her 7-year-old daughter to spend the night in a dumpster outside a spa in a crime-ridden section of Dallas. 

Alicia Carroll, of Garland, faces a charge of abandoning and endangering a child. The 28-year-old remained in Dallas County Jail Monday on $25,000 bond.

Police say Carroll called police Sunday morning saying the person she left her daughter with on Saturday night would not return the child.

Bad parenting: Alicia Carroll, 28, has been charged with child endangerment after Dallas police say she made her daughter sleep alone in a dumpster 

But according to police documents, the 7-year-old girl said her mother told her to 'hide' in the trash bin after the two exited the popular King Spa and Sauna on Royal Lane.

Officers found the little girl 10 hours later after being flagged down by citizens who saw her looking filthy and barefoot.

When she was interviewed by police, Miss Carroll said she had been drinking at the spa and at around 10pm stepped out to 'clear her head,' leaving her daughter inside with an acquaintance, reported Dallas Morning News. 

However, a King Spa worker told NBC 5 that the mother and daughter left the establishment together after attending a party with friends.

When police finally caught up with the 7-year-old girl at around 11.15am Sunday, she told them that when she and her mother left the spa, Carroll suddenly took off running.

The child claimed that Carroll told her they were being pursued by police and had to go into hiding.

According to investigators, Carroll then placed her daughter in a garbage container in a 'high-crime' area and fled. The little girl eventually fell asleep amid refuse and woke up only 10 hours later.

She was able to scramble out of the dumpster and began walking down Royal Lane towards the spa. Passersby spotted her on the street walking without shoes and called police.

Officers who responded to the scene described the child as thirsty, hungry, and covered in filth and cuts to her arms and legs.

Excuse: The 28-year-old initially told police she had left her daughter with an acquaintance so she could 'clear her head' who then refused to give the child back

When pressed about the incident, Alicia Carroll admitted that she became inebriated after downing two vodka drinks in the spa parking lot and did not remember after happened later.

Carroll returned to the spa at around 9.45am the following day looking for her daughter, but the child was not there and employees could not tell her where she’d gone.

The mother then called police, setting off a frantic ground and air search, which ended when a Good Samaritan called them to report seeing the girl wandering down Royal Lane.

The 7-year-old victim was released into the custody of a relative after undergoing a medical evaluation.
