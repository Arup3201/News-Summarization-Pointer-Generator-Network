A ten metre sinkhole in the middle of the Gold Coast Highway at Broadbeach is causing extensive delays to traffic and will not be fixed for at least another 48 hours.

Motorists have been warned to avoid the area as one southbound lane remains closed on the Gold Coast Highway at Margaret Avenue on the main road which links the holiday strip.

There are delays to repairs because emergency crews must first ensure the electricity is isolated before they can repair damage to the water main and resurface the road.

A ten metre sinkhole at Broadbeach, Queensland caused massive delays for commuters on the Gold Coast Highway on Monday morning

A burst water main caused a 'raging torrent' on Sunday morning, creating a ten metre road collapse at the intersection of the Gold Coast Highway and Margaret Avenue. Only one lane remained open on the busy highway on Sunday.

The Gold Coast City Council confirm crews and utilities providers are working together on the site, with services in the area including high voltage electricity and gas mains.

Crews have been working since Sunday to clear debris from the sinkhole, including road signs and traffic lights.

Repairs to the broken water main and the road will commence once the site is declared safe.

Crews waiting for electricity to be isolated from the site before they can repair the damage on Monday morning. It's expected work could take another three days.

Gold Coast Water Simon Waite said work cannot commence on the main until the electricity has been disconnected from the site, according to ABC news.

'We're currently working with the other services, Energex, the gas company and some of the telcos we have, to isolate the electricity before we can actually get in there and start making the repairs,' Mr Waite said.

Motorists are warned to expect big delays as work continues on the site, with one southbound lane closed on the Gold Coast Highway on Monday morning.

Gold Coast Water Director, Paul Heaton says that with three thousand kilometres of pressure pipe under the Gold Coast's streets, 'every now and then something goes wrong,' according to mygc.com.au. 'Some of the pipes are older than others and obviously like all of us they get tired and eventually fail.'

Gold Coast City council assures residents that the water supply in the region has not been affected.
