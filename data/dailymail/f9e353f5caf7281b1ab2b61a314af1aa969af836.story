At a glance Rob Hefferan's latest work could be mistaken for high-fashion photographs of refined taste.

His romantic images of a bride posing elegantly in a grand lavish house look so realistic, you'd never guess they were paintings.

The painter, 44, from Cheshire, is heavily influenced by grand masters of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. His photorealistic work is astounding both in its realism and the intricate details captured in each frame.

The Swan: Each of Rob's paintings can take up to 150 hours to complete

The series of paintings capture the sophisticated beauty of a bride and her groom posing throughout an extravagant mansion.

Working in oil on canvas on paintings that take an average of about 150 
hours to complete, Rob works from real life and from 
photo shoots which he art directs.

Set in lavish locations and grand 
houses, each shoot consists of professional models, photographer, stylists and make-up artists artists - at a cost of around £6,000.

'The results are worth it', he says.

Working
from ideas he sketches out beforehand he poses his models and 
art directs the photographer to shoot hundreds of images.

'It's similar to a
film director guiding his crew on a film set. Once I have edited the 
shots, I will only use a small amount of images to paint from.'

By the window:Rob's work sells in London galleries for around £9,000 a piece

Mirror Mirror: Deep in thought, Hefferan's 'bride' looks into her own reflection

Hefferan captures every minute 
detail. Every tiny wrinkle in the silken fabric of the bride's dress, 
the intricate details of the ornate decor and the varied textures and 
reflective surfaces throughout the space - nothing goes unnoticed.

Browsing through this series - and all of his fine art work - it's difficult to believe that these pieces are not photographs.

'The bride featured in the painting is a model that I have used regularly and appears in many of my paintings.

'My work is available throughout a network of galleries in the UK, please contact the artist for details, the average price of a painting is around  £9,000.

'I do accept commissions for portrait work and can be contacted via my website.'

Daylight: From attention to shadow, crease and structure, the detail in his work is unbelievable

Deep in thought: The bride featured in the paintings is a model that he uses regularly

Hefferan has painted from an early age.

With
a background in advertising illustration he began to concentrate on his
fine art style around 10 years ago. And now his young daughter, seven, is also a very keen artist and relishes the chance to paint.

Putting his advertising illustration background to good use, Hefferan designed the quality street 75th anniversary limited edition chocolate tin last year, which sold out very quickly.

He has also illustrated the Take That Greatest Hits CD cover see and worked on multiple big advertising campaigns

He is currently working on a new fine art painting collection which he will be releasing in the autumn.

A keen sportsman, Hefferan will be running the 
London Marathon next year for the Dreams Come True charity. As part of his 
fund raising he will be donating a painting to the charity.
