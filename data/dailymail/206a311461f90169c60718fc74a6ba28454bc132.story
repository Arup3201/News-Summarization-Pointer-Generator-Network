Former Manchester United defender Paul McGrath is certain that his old team will pip rivals Liverpool to a top-four finish in the Premier League this season, following The Red Devils' superb 3-0 win over Tottenham on Sunday.

United had gone into that game with a number of doubts cast over their Champions League credentials, having delivered some unconvincing performances in recent weeks.

But on Saturday, they were back to their best with a performance replete with pace and verve that blew Spurs away.

United are currently fourth in the league table with 56 points from 29 games, five ahead of Liverpool who have played one fixture less. Liverpool travel to Swansea on Monday night in the hope of closing that gap, but McGrath feels the momentum is firmly in United's favour.

He told TalkSport, 'Liverpool are the only team who can do a bit of damage to Manchester United. I don't see it happening now though.

'United are clicking into gear at the right time and are relaxed in the way they're playing their football.'

McGrath also singled out Maourane Fellaini for special praise after the Belgian continued a fine run of form with a goal against Spurs.

'Marouane Fellaini is the fulcrum of the side now,' he said. 'I don't think Van Gaal can take him out.

'Fellaini gives them the option of going long, he can hold it up and bring other players into play. He is giving the whole team a great lift.'

McGrath played for United between 1982 and 1989, winning the FA Cup in 1985.
