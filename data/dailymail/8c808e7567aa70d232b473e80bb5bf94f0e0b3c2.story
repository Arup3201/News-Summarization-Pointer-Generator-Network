Swansea City are set to announce the £8million signing of Federico Fernandez after the Napoli defender passed a medical with the Welsh club.

MailOnline Sport understands he wrapped up his health check on Tuesday and only formalities remain before the deal is confirmed.

The 25-year-old, who represented Argentina in the World Cup, will become Swansea’s most expensive defender.

Fernandez will partner Ashley Williams and fill the centre-back void left by Chico Flores’s departure.

Speaking in anticipation of the move, Williams said last week: ‘I saw a little bit of him on TV during the World Cup when he was playing for Argentina, but that's about it.

‘So I'll be doing what the fans do – checking out all his clips on YouTube.

‘All I can say is, if he's been playing for teams as good as Napoli and Argentina, then he is bound to be a good player.

‘We need to strengthen the squad because it's going to be a long, difficult season ahead - just as the others have been.’

Fernandez tweeted last week: ‘Ciao Napoli. Yes ciao, because it is not goodbye forever! It cannot be, because it is difficult to stay away from a city like this.’
