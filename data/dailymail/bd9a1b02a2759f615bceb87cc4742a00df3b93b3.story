A general charged with multiple sex offences, including forcible sodomy and wrongful sexual conduct, is to face a court martial and could 
receive life in prison if convicted, the Army said yesterday.

Among the allegations against 
Brigadier General Jeffrey Sinclair are that he carried on affairs with and 
mistreated subordinate officers and later tried to impede the 
investigation of some of the offenses by deleting nude photos and other 
emails.

A 27-year Army veteran who served 
five combat tours, Sinclair is charged with eight crimes, including one 
count of forcible sodomy; two counts of wrongful sexual conduct; six 
counts of inappropriate sexual relationships, and eight counts of 
violating regulations.

Court Martial: Jeffrey A. Sinclair has been charged with forcible 
sodomy, multiple counts of adultery and having inappropriate 
relationships with several female subordinates. His wife Rebecca Sinclair has stood by her man saying that the decade of 
war has taken its toll on military couples and brought pressure on their
marriages

The case is the latest in a series of
missteps by military leaders: At least five current and former generals
at the rank of one-star or higher have been reprimanded or investigated
for possible misconduct in recent months.

The five pages of allegations involved Sinclair's conduct with five women who were not his wife

The charges involve activities when 
he was in Afghanistan, Iraq, Germany and at Fort Bragg, N.C., and they 
include violating what's known as General Order No. 1 - possessing 
alcohol in a war zone.

Sinclair is also charged with 
disobeying orders, including an order from Maj. Gen. James Huggins, his 
superior officer, to cease contact with one of the women. The charges 
allege that Sinclair willfully disobeyed the order by calling the 
woman's phone.

Army officials said Tuesday that Lt. Gen. Daniel B. Allyn, commander of the 18th Airborne Corps, has referred the case to a general court-martial, and the arraignment is set for Jan. 22 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

Defense: Sinclair's wife of 27 years came to his defense, writing in an op-ed piece that the open-ended wars and years spent apart are partially to blame for sex scandals in the Army

The court martial announcement was 
made early in the day Tuesday, but the charges were not released until 
much later. Throughout the Sinclair case, Army officials have been slow 
to release details of the allegations, which are routinely detailed in 
other cases - usually involving soldiers of lower rank.

Sinclair could face life in prison if convicted on the most serious criminal offenses.

The female captain at the heart of the
Sinclair case admitted she carried on a three-year sexual relationship 
with Sinclair, who is married. Adultery is a crime under military law, 
and the admission could end her career.

She also testified at an evidentiary 
hearing early last month that she repeatedly tried to break off the 
affair with Sinclair, who she says threatened to kill her and her family
if she told anyone about their frequent sexual liaisons in hotels, 
headquarters and war zones.

The woman admitted she typically wanted to 
have sex with the general, though she said that on two occasions in 
Afghanistan he exposed himself and physically forced her to perform oral
sex, even as she sobbed.

Disgraced hero: The 27-year Army veteran was deputy commander in charge of logistics and support for the 82nd Airborne Division in Afghanistan before being abruptly relieved in May

Promiscuous: Prosecutors believe Sinclair committed sex crimes against five women in places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Germany

Trial continues: Sinclair's trial is now in its third day at Fort Bragg and witnesses continue to come forward

Although the allegations involve five women, she was the only one who says he used physical force.

Defense lawyers painted the female 
captain as a liar and a scorned lover who was trying to ruin Sinclair's 
life and military reputation. During the hearings they characterized her
as a "crazy" and manipulative "back-stabber" who blamed others for her 
mistakes.

Two female officers who had served 
with Sinclair testified last month that they had given the general nude 
photos at his request.

His wife, Rebecca Sinclair, stayed 
away from the days-long military hearing but later went public with an 
opinion piece in The Washington Post.

In that column she said she was 
not condoning her husband's infidelity, but she said that the decade of 
war has taken its toll on military couples and brought pressure on their
marriages.

In an interview with the AP, Rebecca 
Sinclair said her husband called her last spring to tell her about the 
affair and allegations, and she said they were trying to mend their 
relationship.

Sinclair was deputy commander in 
charge of logistics and support for the 82nd Airborne Division in 
Afghanistan before being relieved in May during the criminal probe. He 
has been on special assignment since then at Fort Bragg.
