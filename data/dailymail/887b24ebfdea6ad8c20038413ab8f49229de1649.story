Photographer Reuben Krabbe had been dreaming of capturing the Northern Lights for four years.

He finally persuaded a group of skier friends to join him on a risky mission to ski down the snow-capped Tombstone Mountains, in Canada, as the spectacular show glimmered above them.

Krabbe and friends, Tobin Seagel, Dave Gheriani, and Joel Jacques, travelled for six days to reach Tombstone Territorial Park in Yukon, braving avalanches and sub zero temperatures. The off-piste skiing location boasts some of the best views of the Northern Lights in Canada.

Spectacular slalom: Professional ski and mountain bike photographer Reuben Krabbe, 24, travelled with three friends to take pictures of the mystical display

Temperatures at night reached -33 degrees Celsius, but that did not discourage the adventurous group from carrying on with their six day mission

The off-piste skiing location boasts some of the best views of the Northern Lights in Canada, which Krabbe described as 'mesmerising'

When the group started the journey to the 1,500ft mountains, they encountered temperatures dropping to a freezing -33 degrees Celsius.

They were unperturbed, and remained dedicated to their mission to slalom under the natural light show.

Professional ski and mountain bike photogragher Reuben Krabbe, 24, said: 'We all wanted to make the trip happen, and Tobin and I had talked about trying to capture the single photograph of the Northern Lights and a skier.

'We spent a total of six days on the slopes, from leaving our truck to arriving back at it. 

'The moment was very unusual and mesmerising.

'It was difficult to concentrate on a specific task when such a beautiful thing is happening above you.'

The photographer has been skiing since his parents taught him at the age of four, and it has since become a massive part of his life. 

All the skiing conditions on the mission were off-piste, and in avalanche conditions, up the high mountains. 

The team braved avalanche and harsh weather conditions but Krabbe fulfilled his four-year wish to capture the Northern Lights in Canada

The cause of the stunning Northern Lights is solar wind interacting with the Earth's magnetic field, creating the  beautiful, natural light show.

The electrically charged particles are drawn to the Earth's poles and their colours are a result of the different gases in the atmosphere. 

In the northern hemisphere they are known as the aurora borealis, and many tourists flock to witness the ethereal display, despite the often high cost and cold temperatures. 

The mysterious show also occurs in the southern hemisphere, the aurora australis, its main audience being the penguins. 

Krabbe said: 'I love to create images that last in a person's head, and I think about it for a long time before I capture it.

'So, a single shot like the northern lights will always be special.'

Dangerous conditions! The group were not put off by the off-piste, dangerous mountain landscape, and completed their mission to ski under the magical light show
