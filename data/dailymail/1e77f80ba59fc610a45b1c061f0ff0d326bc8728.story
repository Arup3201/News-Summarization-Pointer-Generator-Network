The president of the University of Oklahoma has condemned the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity for the racist chant that emerged this weekend and vowed to discipline the students involved - but stopped short of saying they would be expelled from the university. 

David Boren expressed outrage today at the racist song by members of Sigma Alpha Epsilon and revealed that school officials have already identified at least two of the students seen singing 'There will never be a n***** in SAE' on a party bus over the weekend. 

'We will look at all possible punishment and what is available to us under the law. Under the civil rights law it may be possible for us to take action against certain individuals,' he said. 

'Would I be happy if they left voluntarily? Yes. We don't have room for racists and bigots here.' 

He added: 'I don't want them here. I'll pay the bus fare to get them out. They're not coming back.'

Hundreds of furious students have rallied on campus in Norman this morning to protest the outrageous song by the fraternity brothers.

Boren's comments come as a new video emerges that shows a frat brother trying to stop the recording of the sickening song aboard the Sigma Alpha Epsilon party bus.

As one tuxedo-clad brother gleefully sings, 'You can hang him from a tree, but he'll never sign with me, there will never be a n***** in SAE' - another stands up and waves his hands in front of a cell phone camera, attempting to stop the filming of the shameful song. 

Earlier on Monday, Boren gave the fraternity members less than 24 hours to vacate their house on campus. 

He may have offered to buy the frat members a bus ticket out of town - but it seems some of the members will drive a Cadillac instead. An Escalade SUV was among several vehicles - including two U-Haul trucks that were parked outside the fraternity on Monday morning, according to KOCO-TV. 

Fraternity members refused to talk to members of the press as they packed up their belongings and loaded them into the trucks. 

According to the campus student newspaper, the Oklahoma Daily,  several fraternity members were also seen fleeing the house on Sunday night with packed suitcases.

At a rally on Monday morning, shamed the fraternity brothers, according the Oklahoman newspaper: 'You are disgraceful! Real Sooners are not bigots, real Sooners are not racist.'

The OU mascot is the Sooner - in honor of the homesteaders who took up plots of land across the state in the late 19th century. 

In a statement, he said that the members of SAE have until midnight Tuesday morning to clear everything out of the fraternity house.

'Effective immediately, all ties and affiliations between this University and the local SAE are hereby severed. I direct that the house be closed and that members will remove their personal belongings from the house by midnight tomorrow,' he said.  

A vandal approached the house an spray painted 'Tear It D' across the wall of the frat house - presumably meaning to paint 'tear it down.' 

At the SAE chapter at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, a Confederate flag could be seen hanging in the bedroom of one of the fraternity brothers. It was visible from the street through the fraternity's window, according to the O'Colly student newspaper. It has since been taken down.

Alumni of the fraternity have also begun raising money Howard, the African-American cook who ran the kitchen at the fraternity for more than 10 years. 

Blake Burkhart wrote on the IndieGoGo campaign: 'That man is going to walk up to the SAE house tomorrow morning and hear that he no longer has a job. He is going to learn who has been working for. And through some cruel twist of fate, he has to lose the job that he has held for over a decade. He is going to lose his job because of a bus full of racist kids.'

The campaign has raised more than $11,000 toward its goal of $50,000 to help provide support for Howard after losing his job. 

Also on Monday, rapper Waka Flocka Flame canceled his show at scheduled for this spring at the fraternity house. 

In a statement, the Atlanta-based musician said: 'I must say I'm disgusted and disappointed in the actions of the SAE fraternity at University of Oklahoma and I will be canceling my scheduled performance for them next month. Racism is something I will not tolerate.'

The racist footage that kicked it all off was uploaded to YouTube Sunday and shows members of a Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter singing that there 'will never be a n*****' in their fraternity.

In the brief clip, one two students stand up to a group of their peers, wearing bow ties and dress shirts, in the vile chant, sung to the tune of If You're Happy And You Know It.

The footage is believed to have been filmed on Saturday - when the rest of the nation was focused on Selma, Alabama, where the president said the civil rights movement has not yet completed its long march. 

'There will never be a n***** SAE': The vile chant was made by members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity chapter at the University of Oklahoma

National heads of Sigma Alpha Epsilon closed the fraternity Sunday night after the video was shared widely online, and suspended all of its members. 

During the sickening clip the students are clearly heard singing: 'There will never be a n***** SAE, there will never be a n***** SAE.

'You can hang him from a tree, but he'll never sign with me, there will never be a n***** SAE.'

A female voice in the background can also be heard asking a friend: 'You've never heard it before?' 

The footage shows the group on a bus, apparently headed to a party. It was made public by a black students' pressure group at the university called Unheard.

In the wake of the video, the national leadership of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, which has branches across the country, said the University of Oklahoma chapter would be punished.

Reaction: The national heads of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon have said those responsible will be punished

Brad Cohen, the Eminent Supreme Archon of the organization, confirmed that the video was authentic.

He added that he was 'shocked and disgusted' by it, and said those responsible 'will be dealt with'.

Cohen also said the song, which the video participants seemed to know well, was not part of any SAE traditions.

A statement from SAE said: 'Sigma Alpha Epsilon's national headquarters has closed its Oklahoma Kappa chapter at the University of Oklahoma following the discovery of an inappropriate video.

'In addition, all of the members have been suspended, and those members who are responsible for the incident may have their membership privileges revoked permanently.

'We apologize for the unacceptable and racist behavior of the individuals in the video, and we are disgusted that any member would act in such a way.

'Furthermore, we are embarrassed by this video and offer our empathy not only to anyone outside the organization who is offended but also to our brothers who come from a wide range of backgrounds, cultures and ethnicities.'

SAE has more than 200 chapters across the country, 15,000 undergraduate members and around 200,000 alumni. The mission of Sigma Alpha Epsilon is 'to promote the highest standards of friendship, scholarship, and service for our members based upon the ideals set forth by our Founders and as specifically enunciated in our creed, The True Gentleman.'

For more than half a century, new members are required to memorize and recite the following:

'A True Gentleman is the man whose conduct proceeds from good will and an acute sense of propriety, and whose self-control is equal to all emergencies; who does not make the poor man conscious of his poverty, the obscure man of his obscurity, or any man of his inferiority or deformity; who is himself humbled if necessity compels him to humble another; who does not flatter wealth, cringe before power, or boast of his own possessions or achievements; who speaks with frankness but always with sincerity and sympathy; whose deed follows his word; who thinks of the rights and feelings of others, rather than his own; and who appears well in any company, a man with whom honor is sacred and virtue safe.'
