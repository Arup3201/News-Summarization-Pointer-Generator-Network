Kevin Pietersen has been given no assurances about a return to England’s set-up in a phone call with the new power- broker of English cricket.

Mixed messages coming out of the ECB have left the impression the door is open to the maverick batsman, who was sacked last year after the Ashes debacle.

But incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves, who takes over from Pietersen’s arch-opponent Giles Clarke on May 15, has spoken to the 34-year-old and made it clear there are no guarantees — even if he scores heavily for Surrey on his expected county comeback.

Graves, who instigated the conversation, hoped to keep it confidential but the tenor of the chat was that Pietersen’s England future rests entirely with the selectors, who would consider form as well as other aspects — such as upsetting team spirit — when picking the Test side this summer. A number of players, led by captain Alastair Cook, would strongly resist a KP comeback.

Though Graves told Pietersen he would not interfere with selection, having never done so as chairman of Yorkshire, Pietersen (right) remains so enthused about the slim possibility of playing for England again that he will commit himself to Surrey this season. He said while commentating on Test Match Special at the World Cup: ‘If I can do anything that can help me get back into it for England, then it’s something I want to do.’

Surrey still have to agree the detail of Pietersen’s re-engagement but he is expected to fulfil at least some of his £205,000 IPL contract with Sunrisers Hyderabad. He would then need some practice in red-ball cricket, which he last played in the Sydney Test of January 2014 that completed the 5-0 Ashes whitewash.

England cricket managing director Paul Downton said he watched every ball of that game and had never seen a player so disengaged from his team-mates.

Given the strong opposition of Downton and chairman of selectors James Whitaker, Pietersen’s hopes boil down to the side doing so badly against the West Indies and New Zealand in the next two Test series that radical changes are considered for the Ashes, which starts in July.

Former England captain Michael Vaughan has called England’s current situation a ‘soap opera’, and says the team need to beat the West Indies 3-0 to stop talk of a Pietersen comeback.

‘It is clear that for Kevin to have any hope of playing for England — and it is only a small hope — he has to play county cricket and we will see what happens,’ Vaughan said on TMS.

‘The game needs a change, it needs someone to come in and say the past is the past and to start afresh. Graves is clearly going to do that. Obviously it’s going to ruffle a few feathers but maybe that’s what they need.

‘Maybe this is a fantastic motivational tool. If the team don’t want Pietersen in the side then go to the West Indies and win 3-0. Play better, score more runs and win more games and Pietersen will never play again.’
