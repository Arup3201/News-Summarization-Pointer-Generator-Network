A father was sent home from hospital with pain killers after doctors failed to spot he had a broken neck.

Health chiefs are investigating after Darren Langabeer, 40, was told he could have been 'paralysed for life' by the botched diagnosis.

Landscape gardener Darren was rushed to hospital in agony after allegedly being beaten up in broad daylight.

Darren Langabeer, returned to hospital five days after they sent him home with pins and needles and numbness in his arms

He was given medical scans - and sent home after doctors told him he had a 'trapped nerve.'

But Darren returned to hospital five days later with pins and needles and numbness in his arms.

The father-of-three was told he had a broken neck and needed immediate treatment.

Darren said: 'The doctor told me I could have been paralysed. They said I was lucky to be walking.

'They rushed me straight to the spinal unit in Cardiff and I had to have an operation to fix my neck.

'I’m only 40, and with a young family I was really scared to death. I could have been left in a wheelchair for the rest of my life - how would my family cope?'

Darren said he was assaulted outside shops in his home town of Llanelli, near Swansea.

He was rushed to Glangwili General Hospital in Carmarthen where he was treated and discharged just eight hours later.

Darren, who is self-employed landscape gardener, carried on with his job until the pain became too much for him.

When he returned to the hospital doctors realised their mistake and rushed him to a specialist spine unit in Cardiff.

Darren spent a week recovering at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff and has been told he cannot work or drive for at least three months.

He added: 'I carried on working because they thought it was a trapped nerve. I had days of absolute agony, I’d been carrying around lawn mowers and things.

'I’ve built my business up for three years, and I don’t know what will happen to it now, I don’t know how we’re going to manage if I can’t work.'

Hywel Dda Local Health Board are now investigating why Darren was allowed to be sent home.

A spokeswoman said: 'The health board cannot comment further at this time as a full investigation is ongoing.'

A Dyfed-Powys Police spokeswoman confirmed a man had been arrested in connection with the alleged assault.
