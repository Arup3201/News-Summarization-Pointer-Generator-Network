A California woman was out walking her dog in the pre-dawn hours Tuesday when she was attacked by a man wielding a medieval-style weapon.

Travis Lanning, 34, was arrested at the scene in Sacramento County and charged with assault with a deadly weapon and mayhem.

The victim, an unnamed woman in her 50s, was taken to a hospital with non life-threatening injuries to her head.

Medieval mayhem: Travis Lanning, 34, pictured left in a mugshot and right in a photo from his Facebook page holding a mace, was arrested Tuesday for allegedly beating a woman with the medieval weapon 

Crime scene: The brazen attack took place along Garfield Avenue in the pre-dawn hours of Tuesday morning 

Weapon of choice: Deputies on the scene recovered the spiky club allegedly used in the assault 

A Sacramento sheriff's deputy was patrolling Garfield Avenue at 4.15am when he heard screams and came upon a suspect beating a woman with a mace - a spiked metal club used to bludgeon opponets in medieval combat.

According to the sheriff's office, Travis Lanning approached his victim from behind with the words: 'I'm going to kill you.'

He then allegedly proceeded to strike her over the head with the heavy mace, puncturing her skull. She is expected to make a full recovery.

The victim initially told officials that Lanning also killed her dog, a dachshund mix, with the mace, but the pet was later found unharmed.

Witness Lisa French told CBS Sacramento the woman was 'bleeding all over' after the vicious cudgel attack.

French also described the moment sheriff’s deputies apprehended Lanning, who kept mum and refused to cooperate, forcing them to carry him into an awaiting squad car.

Following his arrest, Lanning was photographed for his mugshot with blood on his forehead and nose. It is unclear if he sustained injuries in the melee, or whether the blood came from his victim’s wounds.

Travis Lanning is being held on $80,000 bail. He is expected to undergo a mental health evaluation and be tested for drugs and alcohol.

Neighbors claimed the 34-year-old suffers from bipolar disorder and has been known in the past to go off his medication, reported the news channel KCRA. Last month, Lanning lost his mother, Leslie Lanning, to pneumonia.

Two weeks ago, he shared photos on his Facebook page showing him posing with a silver mace, which looked identical to the weapon recovered by police from the scene of the brazen early-morning attack.

His social media posts suggest that Lanning has a strong interest in fantasy and Eastern legends, and in February he released what he described as an ‘epic poem’ about the fictional ‘grandmaster monk’ Ten Po.

He also self-published a book of poetry titled Tenebrous Yearning, which to his chagrin has not sold a single copy in three years.
