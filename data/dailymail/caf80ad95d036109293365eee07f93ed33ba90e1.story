Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton returned to England for a night of glamour at the British Fashion Awards with girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger.

Hamilton is still riding high after picking up his second World Championship in Abu Dhabi just over a week ago.

The 29-year-old has been part-taking in an array of media commitments since being crowned champion and is clearly enjoying more time with Scherzinger, who is normally based in America.

Hamilton, who won the F1 title by 67 points over team-mate Nico Rosberg, came face to face with the German for the first time this weekend since the season finale.

The Mercedes pair took part in the manufacturer’s Stars and Cars event in Germany where they celebrated their constructors’ and drivers’ titles with their devoted fans.

Hamilton and Rosberg completed some demonstration laps around a temporary track around the German firm’s museum before the pair mingled with the dedicated fans who supported them all season.
