The Navy SEAL Team Six member who unveiled himself as the man who shot dead Osama bin Laden is reportedly being investigated by military police for leaking secrets.

Robert O'Neill, who came forward as the mystery shooter who killed the al-Qaeda leader during a 2011 raid, allegedly gave away crucial details of the mission and prompted a probe by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS).

He is suspected of leaking classified information, which could lead to criminal charges from the elite federal bureau, according to The Daily Beast.

'Under investigation': According to reports, bin Laden shooter Robert O'Neill is being investigated 

Limelight: O'Neill stepped forward to star in a TV news tell-all about his role in the mission - despite being warned against it by Navy SEAL top brass

On its website the NCIS says that it usually only investigates allegations that could lead to a year or more in prison.

O'Neill was repeatedly warned by Naval top brass not to go on air and speak about his participation in the secretive mission - but appeared anyway and spoke at length about his role.

He gave a long, two-part interview to Fox News in November in which he gave his life story up to the mission, then described it in moment-to-moment detail. He had previously been the subject of an anonymous account in Esquire magazine about the mission.

Some have argued that nothing he said - beyond identifying himself - goes beyond leaks about the operation already made by other authorities, including White House politicians. 

He told how he shot bin Laden three times in the head after leaping from a helicopter and busting into the terrorist compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

His account, in which he fires three bullets into bin Laden's head and splits his skull, has been disputed by other SEAL sources, who say it is impossible to know who fired the fatal shot.

Another member of the elite Team Six, Matt Bissonnette, has also claimed to be the man who killed him, and wrote a book about his exploits.

Before the revelations, SEAL high command distributed a letter urging current and former officers to stick to their non-disclosure agreements. 

Rear Admiral Brian Losey, the commander of the Naval Special Warfare Group, wrote: 'At Naval Special Warfare's core is the SEAL ethos.

 'A critical tenant of our ethos is "I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions."

'Violators of our Ethos are neither Temmates in good standing, not Teammates who represent Naval Special Warfare.

'We do not abide willful or selfish disregard for our core values in return for public notoriety and financial gain, which only diminishes otherwise honorable service, courage and sacrifice.

'Our credibility as a premier fighting force is forged in this sacrifice and has been accomplished with honor, as well as humility.' 

A spokesman told DailyMail.com: 'The NCIS is in receipt of an allegation that Mr O'Neill may have revealed classified information to persons not authorized to receive such information.

'In response, NCIS has initiated an investigation to determine the merit of the allegations.'
