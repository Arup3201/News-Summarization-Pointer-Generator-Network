A 20-year-old man who was among 14 people struck by lightning on Sunday has died in hospital after rare summer thunderstorms swept through Southern California.

Nine other people were hospitalized - including a 15-year-old and one in a critical condition - after the lightning hit Venice Beach in Los Angeles about 2.50pm.

The incident occurred in the 3500 block of South Ocean Front Walk, which is the famed Venice Fishing Pier.

Those enjoying a Sunday afternoon on the beach said they saw the bright flash of the lightning before people started fleeing the water, in what one witness described as like a scene from the film Jaws.

While others were treated at scene and
 released, a swimmer who went missing in the water, sparking a major 
search by lifegaurds, was among those hospitalized, Los Angeles fire spokeswoman Katherine Main said.

Photos of the scene show lifeguards desperately giving CPR to a young man, who they pulled from the water.

Witnesses said the victim did not appear to respond to the CPR.

'The guy wasn't moving. He wasn't responding at all,' Jesus Zamudio of Riverside told The Los Angeles Times.

'It was sad to see, the guy looked young.'

Experts have said that the hundreds of lightning strikes that hit Southern California are rare but there is still a chance of storms today.

The storms were caused as a moisture-laden monsoonal flow spread up from the south and swept across the region, all of the way out to the ocean.

Stuart Seto, a weather specialist with the National Weather Service explained: 'This is pretty rare because usually the flow affects just the deserts and sometimes the mountains.

'The storms began to dissipate as they moved north-west leaving just a chance of storms through Monday, mainly on the deserts and mountains.'

Lightning injuries or fatalities can occur during a direct strike or after a current is passed through the ground or jumps from a taller object, such as a tree, according to the National Weather Service.

Symptoms can range from cardiac arrest and injury to the nervous system to muscle soreness, headache, and confusion.

Steve
 Christensen added that his friend had been body-surfing and was sitting
 on the beach when lifeguards began searching for a missing swimmer.

'He
 (Christensen's friend) went out to the water to find him and walked 
right into him,' Mr Christensen said. 'He was face down on the bottom.'

Mr Christensen added his friend pulled the man, who appeared to be in his 20s, from the water, and lifeguards began CPR before taking him away on a truck.

The identity of the 20-year-old that was killed has not been released. 

Confirmation of the cause of death was pending an autopsy. Los Angeles County Coroner's Lt. Larry Dietz said he also can't confirm whether the man was a swimmer who was pulled from the water and given CPR. 

It is thought the man in a critical condition is a 55-year-old who had been surfing.

Other witnesses told the publication the storm 'came out of nowhere'.

Joe Doro also told NBC Los Angeles: 'It was the loudest thunder I've ever heard.

'It was like a scene out of Jaws, all the mothers were going in to grab their kids and drag them out of the water.

While Stuart Acher said he was struck by lightning while playing volleyball on the beach.

'We
 went about our game and then all of a sudden, there was a big flash of 
light and a boom, and it felt like someone punched me in the back of my 
head,' he told KABC-TV.

'It went down my whole side of my 
right body, and my calves sort of locked up, and I fell over. And I 
looked up and everybody else was, you know, falling over.'

Paramedics examined Acher but he felt all right and went back to playing volleyball.

'The
 majority of the folks that were on the (volleyball) court all felt a 
little tingly,' said another player, Jerome Williams. 'Everyone hit the 
court. It sounded like a sonic boom.'

On Santa Catalina Island, often called
 Catalina Island, off the coast, a 57-year-old man was struck by 
lightning on a golf course and was hospitalized in stable condition, 
said Steve Denning, a law enforcement technician with the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department.

The man was believed to be the 14th person hit in the storm.

Denning did not have other details.

The
 lightning strikes occurred as a thunderstorm hit the island, causing 
minor flooding and setting two small fires in the brushy backcountry 
that were quickly doused, Denning said.

The unusual weather came from monsoon moisture that brought a line of brief but fierce afternoon thunderstorms to the region.

Evacuation: People move off the Venice Beach Boardwalk following lightning strikes on Sunday

The National Weather Service urged 
residents in Venice and surrounding areas to stay indoors if they hear 
thunder because lightning strikes.

The
 Fire Department has also advised anyone in the water at the time to see
 a doctor as electrical burns can sometimes have delayed effects.

Parts
 of Catalina Island received more than three-quarters of an inch of rain
 in about two hours, said Stuart Seto, a weather specialist with the 
National Weather Service in Oxnard.

A moisture-laden monsoonal flow 
usually spawns thunderstorms when it hits hot weather in the deserts and
 sometimes in the mountains this time of year, Mr Seto said.

'This time, it came all around San Diego and northwards,' spreading out into the ocean as well as inland.'

Earlier in the day, hail and rain fell in San Diego, with half an inch of rain reported in Del Mar, according to The L.A. Times.

About 1,000 customers of San Diego Gas & Electric were left without power, officials said.

Further south in Redonda Beach, an extra 300 people were also without power.

Others reported damage to property by the lightning.

A sizable burn mark could be seen on the front of an upper-level apartment, while severe damage was done to a white BMW convertible parked in a driveway.
