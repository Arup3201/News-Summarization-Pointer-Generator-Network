An Egyptian court has sentenced four members of the Muslim Brotherhood to death and the banned group's leader to life in prison.

Mohamed Badie was one of 14 members sentenced to life, alongside his deputy Khairat El-Shater and leading Brotherhood figure and lawmaker Mohamed El-Beltagy. Mr Badie and Mr El-Beltagy both showed their defiance at the verdicts, gesturing behind the heavy screens of their cages to cameras in the Cairo courtroom.

The case stemmed from clashes near the group's headquarters on June 30, 2013, four days before the ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.

The fighting left 11 people dead and 91 wounded. The men were accused of murder and possession of firearms, among other charges.

Other key figures sentenced to life include party head Saad el-Katatni and his deputy, Essam el-Erian.

Four lower-level members of the Brotherhood were sentenced to death for inciting the violence in June 2013. 

Two of those sentenced to death and three sentenced to life were tried in absentia.

The death sentences are subject to appeal and many of the defendants are already serving lengthy sentences on other charges.

Once the top leader of the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, Badie has already been sentenced to multiple life terms, and was one of hundreds given the death sentence in a mass trial that drew international criticism of Egypt's judicial system.

Some 22,000 people have been arrested since Morsi's ouster, including most of the Brotherhood's leaders, as well as non-Islamist activists swept up by police during protests.

President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who as army chief toppled Morsi, describes the Brotherhood as a major security threat.

The movement says it is committed to peaceful activism. 

The same day another Egyptian court listed the Palestinian group Hamas as a terrorist organisation, judicial sources said, part of a sustained crackdown on Islamists in the most populous Arab state. 

Hamas is an offshoot of the Brotherhood, which the authorities have also declared a terrorist group in Egypt and have repressed systematically since the coup against Morsi.

While a court ruled in January that Hamas' armed wing was a terrorist organisation, Saturday's broader ruling against the entire group has potentially greater consequences for the already strained relationship between Cairo and Hamas, which dominates the Gaza Strip on Egypt's border.

'The Egyptian court's decision to list the Hamas movement as a terror organisation is shocking and is dangerous, and it targets the Palestinian people and its factions of resistance,' Hamas said in a statement after the ruling.

'It will have no influence on the Hamas movement,' Hamas said.

After the January decision against Hamas' Qassem Brigades, a source close to the armed wing signalled the group would no longer accept Egypt as a broker between it and Israel.

Cairo has for many years played a central role in engineering ceasefires between Israel and Hamas, including a truce reached between the sides in August that ended a 50-day Gaza war.

A spokesman for the Egyptian government declined to say what actions the government would take to enforce the ruling.

'When a final judgment is issued, we will discuss this,' Hossam al-Qawish said.
