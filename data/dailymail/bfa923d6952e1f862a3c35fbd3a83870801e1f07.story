Dr Martin Weale, a member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, signalled rates could rise by next spring

Households should prepare for interest rates to rise early next year, a senior official at the Bank of England declared last night.

Dr Martin Weale, who sits on the powerful committee which sets rates at the central bank, said borrowing costs are likely to increase in spring 2015.

But he added that the first rate hike since July 2007 could come even sooner than that in a stark warning to borrowers that the era of ultra-cheap home loans is coming to an end.

The explosive comments - the most 
explicit signal yet of when rates will rise - raised the prospect of a 
hike before the General Election in May 2015.

Analyst said guidance on interest rates ‘does not get much more specific than that’.

It
 marked a dramatic change of tack for the Bank which has in the past 
refused to comment on when it plans to raise or cut interest rates.

Governor
 Mark Carney last week hinted that rates could rise next year - but his 
comments were far more measured than those by Dr Weale yesterday.

The
 prospect of higher borrowing costs will alarm millions of households 
who have benefited from cheap mortgages since rates were slashed to an 
all-time low of 0.5 per cent in March 2009.

But
 Dr Weale also suggested that the benefits for savers will be limited 
with rates only expected to rise slowly and stay well below the 5 per 
cent average seen before the financial crisis.

‘I
 think it is very helpful if we try and explain that the most likely 
path for interest rates is that the first rise will come perhaps in the 
spring of next year,’ said Dr Weale. ‘And then the path is likely to be 
relatively gradual.’

He added: ‘I couldn’t rule out the need for a rate rise coming earlier.’

Howard Archer, chief UK economist at 
IHS Global Insight, said: ‘You don’t get much more specific forward 
guidance than that. Martin Weale has certainly delivered.’

Dr
 Weale, a highly respected economist who has sat on the Bank’s monetary 
policy committee since 2010, said the timing of the General Election 
would have little impact on the decision.

‘During an election campaign it would obviously be difficult but the election campaign will last for three weeks,’ he said.

The
 Bank has already moved the day it sets interest rates in May 2015 from 
the seventh - the day voters go to the polls - to the 15th so as not to 
clash with the election.

A rate rise before polling day could spook millions of borrowers worried about their mortgage costs.

But
 it would be welcomed by savers who have been hammered by low returns 
since the financial crisis struck and rates were cut to emergency lows.

Chris
 Williamson, chief economist at research group Markit, said: ‘If the 
economy is judged resilient enough to absorb a rate hike then it’s 
something to celebrate.’

George
 Osborne has said that the discussion around the possibility of higher 
interest rates ‘is a mark of success’ because it shows ‘we have started 
to see the recovery take off’.

It marked a dramatic change of tack for the Bank which has in the past refused to comment on when it plans to raise or cut interest rates

The Bank last week raised its growth forecasts for the UK economy for this year from 2.8 per cent to 3.4 per cent. Economic growth has not been stronger since 2003.

Mr Carney hailed Britain as ‘one of the strongest economies in the advanced world’ as he predicted robust growth, tumbling unemployment and low inflation in the coming years.

Mortgage lender Nationwide estimates that around one million people have got on to the property ladder for the first in the past five years.

Many will have stretched their budget to the limit in order to get on to the ladder - but will now have to find a way to increase their repayments.

Graham Beale, chief executive of Nationwide, has raised fears over ‘a whole generation of borrowers how have never experienced increases in their monthly mortgage payments’.

Mr Carney has insisted that any rate rises will be ‘gradual’ and ‘limited’.

He raised the prospect of rates only rising to 2 per cent by early 2017 and staying at between 2 per cent and 3 per cent until around 2020.

The Canadian, who succeeded Lord King as Governor in July last year, said the MPC will not return rates to the 5 per cent average seen before the financial crisis any time soon.
