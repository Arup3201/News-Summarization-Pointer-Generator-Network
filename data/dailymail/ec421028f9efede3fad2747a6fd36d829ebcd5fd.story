Fierce fighting continued across swathes of Iraq today as Kurdish peshmerga and Iraqi forces beat back ISIS jihadists and advanced deeper into rebel-held territory.

Today there were front line clashes between the groups as the violence spilled into Buyuk Yeniga village, a small township located between halfway Baghdad and Kirkuk.

In recent weeks Iraqi forces, boosted by American airstrikes and a steady stream of armaments, have put ISIS on the back foot with victories in a series of key towns.

million people. Atmeh is close to the border with Turkey

Only two days ago Shiite militias and Kurdish Peshmerga imposed full control over the towns of Amerli, Enjana and Sulaiman Pek, all of which are located in between Baghdad and Kirkuk.

All three towns were ISIS strongholds earlier this year and reason for alarm over the jihadists' growing proximity to Baghdad.

Battles are now raging in and around Kirkuk, which is thought to remain fiercely contested despite a major Iraqi government offensive launched yesterday.

Meanwhile, the ISIS atrocities have continued with militants kidnapping 40 men from a town in Iraq's northern province of Kirkuk today, dragging the men into cars before driving off, according to local residents.

Residents of the Sunni Muslim town of Hawija said by telephone they did not know why the men had been taken from a district on the edge of the town.

They added that Islamic State, which controls Hawija, had not faced any resistance from its inhabitants.

Islamic State has seized hundreds of Iraqi and Syrian soldiers as well as members of other insurgent groups, journalists and civilians. Some have been sold for ransom and others have been killed.

Prime Minister David Cameron's government has announced it may arm Kurdish forces but he has ruled out authorising British airstrikes against Islamic State militants before a new Iraqi government is in place.

Iraq's Prime Minister-designate Haider al-Abadi said last week he was optimistic about forming a new government soon. 

Britain has so far carried out aid drops and surveillance and transported military supplies to Kurdish regional forces allied with the Baghdad central government.

Other European countries, including Germany, France and Italy have already agreed to send Kurdish forces a quantity of light weapons to use against the militants who have swept into northern Iraq.

'We're prepared to do more and we're considering actively whether to give them arms ourselves and whether we can do more directly to train Kurdish militia - we're already playing a role there but we can do more,' Mr Cameron told ITV.

Mr Cameron, hosting a two-day NATO summit in Wales, said he was not ruling anything out in the effort to 'squeeze' the Islamic State (IS) 'out of existence', but signalled Britain would not join US airstrikes before a new Iraqi government is in place.

He told the BBC: 'What is required is a strategy to help those on the ground and to have an Iraqi government there that can make a difference, Kurdish forces that can make a difference and then we ask what more we can do to help them. It needs to be that way round.'
