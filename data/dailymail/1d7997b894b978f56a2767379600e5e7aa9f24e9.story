Arrested: Murder suspect Nazira Maria Cross has been caught in Peru

A woman suspected of poisoning her husband in 2008 and burying his body on their Nevada ranch has been caught in Peru after six years on the run.

Nazira Maria Cross was arrested at her home by Peruvian police on Wednesday morning, after the FBI received a tip off that the murder suspect had fled to the South American country.

The 48-year-old professor is believed to have poisoned Michael Cross in California, before driving to Nevada to bury his body.Â 

Cross, who is originally from Costa RIca, is accused of fleeing the U.S. while authorities waited for autopsy results.

In 2009, she was charged with first-degree murder over the death of the 55-year-old owner of two car dealerships.

The
 FBI claims that Cross poisoned her estranged husband in California in
 July 2008, then drove his body to Lovelock, where they owned property, 
to dispose of his body.

After burying his body, Cross is accused of repeatedly driving over the grave.

A year later the Nevada attorney-general
 charged Cross and her two adult children with faking her death in South
 America to obtain life insurance payouts.

Her daughter was fined $1,000 and her son remains a fugitive, according to the Reno Gazette-Journal.

In a 2012 civil case, a Reno judge ruled that Cross was a 'culpable actor' in her husband's death.

The couple had been married for eight years, but divorced in the January of the year Mr Cross was killed. They had met when he vacationed in Costa Rica.

On the day he was poisoned, neighbors claimed Mr Cross's wife asked for help getting him into her car, and told them he was sick and was on his way to hospital.

When the neighbors didn't hear back from Mr Cross, they called police who discovered his body on the ranch, according to Inside Costa Rica.

Cross's case has been widely featured, and her wanted poster was distributed across the U.S. and internationally. The case was also featured on America's Most Wanted.

The U.S. has made a request for Peru to extradite Cross to face prosecution.
