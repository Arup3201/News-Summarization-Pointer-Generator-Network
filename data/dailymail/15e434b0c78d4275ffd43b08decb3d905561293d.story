George Zimmerman has said he 'absolutely' believes that he is a victim of the fallout following his fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin on February 26, 2012, in Sanford, Florida.

In his second TV interview in a matter of days, Zimmerman also compared himself to ‘all our fallen soldiers’ as he claimed his trail for second-degree murder and manslaughter had been unjust and the result of political pressure.

‘I feel the people in power, like [Florida] Gov. Scott, cowered to political pressure and shredded the Constitution, and spit in the face of all our fallen soldiers, and went through with a malicious prosecution, simply for political pressure,’ said Zimmerman.

In his second TV interview in two days, George Zimmerman has said he 'absolutely' believes that he is a victim of the fallout following his fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in 2012

The interview, conducted with Fusion TV's Derrick Ashong, will air in its entirety on Tuesday evening and in it Zimmerman protests that he has never been racist and that he is living ‘the most Christlike that I can.’

He also told Ashong that he had nothing to say to Trayvon Martin’s parents ‘because of the ongoing civil rights violation investigation by the Department of Justice, I wouldn't say anything to them.’

As well as denying being a racist, Zimmerman claimed he didn’t understand why people are so animated about the racial component of his case.

When asked if the races involved in his case had been reversed, he said he believed that the outcome of the trail would have been identical.

Zimmerman also spoke about his attempts to sell paintings as a means of supporting himself and he was forced to deny that he was profiting off the tragic loss of another person's life.

‘I try to move on with my life and just live the most Christlike that I can,' he said. 'I'm $2.5 million in debt, so I have to do something to earn a living and keep a roof over my head,’ he said.

Ashong also asked Zimmerman if he ever thought he might be able to have anything resembling a normal life.

‘I hate to sound jaded by what's happened, but in all sincerity I plan for the worst and hope for the best,’ said Zimmerman. ‘Whatever it is, I hope that God loves me and uses me for whatever he has planned.’

On the same day that that interview is being televised, it has been reported that Zimmerman has been forced to flee Miami after being chased by a crowd and that there is a $10,000 bounty on his head.

Scapegoat: George Zimmerman, pictured Monday, has accused President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder of making him a 'scapegoat'

Zimmerman, 30, was apparently forced to abandon his home with his family in the aftermath of a televised interview on CNN on Monday morning. Infuriated protesters ambushed him, his girlfriend and her son on the beach.

In his CNN interview, Zimmerman accused President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder of making him a 'scapegoat'.

Speaking on CNN's Chris Cuomo, Zimmerman revealed he still receives death threats seven months after he was acquitted of the murder of Trayvon Martin.

He said he suffered a 
'miscarriage of justice' in his trial for the killing of the Florida teen, and maintains that he acted in self-defense within the law.

When Cuomo asked him what he was being made a scapegoat for, he 
responded: 'The government, the president, the attorney general.

'I don’t know what they're thinking 
or why they're thinking it, all I know is that they're doing it. I don't
 know what agenda they have.'

Law school: Zimmerman, 30, also told Chris Cuomo, left, that he wants to go back to school and get a law degree so he said he can make sure no one else goes through what he did

Zimmerman,
 30, also told Cuomo he wants to go back to school and get a law degree 
so he said he can make sure no one else goes through what he did.

'I would like to professionally continue my education and hopefully become an attorney,' Zimmerman said.

'I
 think that's the best way to stop the miscarriage of justice that 
happened to me from happening to somebody else. I don't think it should 
happen to anyone ever again, not one person.'

Zimmerman, who has remained a fixture
 in news headlines, said he still gets death threats following his 
intensely controversial acquittal in the Martin case.

'I
 have a lot of people saying that, you know, they guarantee that they're
 going to kill me and I'll never be a free man,' he told Cuomo. 'I 
realize that they don't know me. They know who I was portrayed to be.'

He
 also said he's often accused of being racist, but said he was raised by
 Peruvian family members and that some of his family are black.

'Sad. Very sad': How George Zimmerman described himself in the recent interview with Ilia Calderón

He said he'd never stop trying to fight the accusation that he's 'the guy who gets away with killing a black kid.'

'If
 it takes one person a day at a time to help them realize that's not 
what this case was about then that's what I'll do,' Zimmerman said.

The comments come just days after he claimed he is suffering from post-traumatic stress and is homeless after his trial.

Zimmerman made the claims to 
journalist Ilia Calderón, who interviewed him for the Spanish language 
current affairs show Aqui y Ahora that aired on Univision on Sunday at 
7pm.

During the 
interview, Zimmerman also claimed that Martin threatened to kill him 
before he shot and killed the unarmed 17-year-old.

'When
 he saw my handgun and looked at it and told me that he was going to 
kill me that night, uh, that was enough of a threat after the way he had
 attacked me. So, I felt his hand going for my weapon,' Zimmerman said.

Insight: Zimmerman told Calderón that he receives death threats due to bad media coverage, not the fact that he shot Trayvon Martin

When asked how he feels now, Zimmerman responded 'Sad. Very sad.'

He told Calderón that after shooting Martin, his main concern was that he had missed his target.

'I was afraid it had gone through his clothes and that it was going to go... get lost, and, um, you know, go into a house and - because the young man was still talking to me, as I have said. So I thought that it hadn't... affected him, and I got worried, and I said, "I hope that it hasn't - that the bullet hasn't hit a neighbor,"' Zimmerman said.

The much-maligned former insurance 
salesman who has recently taken to selling his unique art on eBay said 
he was '100 per cent' sure of his actions that night, and that had he 
not shot Martin, the teen would have killed him.

Zimmerman
 said that he has had death threats since the trial, which he put down 
to his portrayal in the media and not his shooting of a teenaged boy.

Zimmerman told Calderón that he can no longer lead a normal life and must wear a bullet-proof vest when he is out in public.

Describing himself as 'totally homeless,' Zimmerman said his family helps him 'a lot.'
