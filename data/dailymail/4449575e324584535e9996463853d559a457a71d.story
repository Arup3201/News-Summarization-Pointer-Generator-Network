England will be bidding to host a football tournament in 2018 after all — despite the ignominy that still surrounds their doomed World Cup campaign.

The FA board agreed at their last meeting that England would apply to stage the European Under 17 Championship, with the decision due to be made by the UEFA executive committee in Nyon at the end of this month.

FA relations with FIFA remain at rock bottom, ruling out any ambition of hosting a global competition for the foreseeable future.

But there are no such problems with UEFA, with whom the FA have been bridge-building since the vote debacle in Zurich in 2010.

And that despite three of the UEFA executive — Senes Erzik, Marios Lefkaritis and Angel Maria Villar Llona — taking part in the flawed World Cup election.

The European Under 17 tournament, in which Germany’s World Cup-winning goalscorer Mario Gotze made his name, will feature 16 nations in 2018. The FA plan is for St George’s Park, outside Burton, to be the hub of the event, with other matches at nearby grounds.

There is little or no job security in professional football, so the social media app Network90, designed to connect football people and help them find a role in the game, is starting to make an impression.

This has been helped by the involvement in the burgeoning business of founder and double World Player of the Year Luis Figo. 

His hands-on approach included offering Network90 membership to Holland midfielder Demy de Zeeuw, who had advertised himself for work anywhere in the world on business recruitment site LinkedIn.

The remarkable crowds at Coventry’s Ricoh Arena to watch relocated Wasps point to a healthy Midlands appetite for rugby. Yet the only World Cup 2015 venue that still has tickets available for all three of its matches is Leicester City’s King Power Stadium.

Nearby Welford Road, home to Leicester Tigers, is a rugby stronghold that would surely have sold out by now, but tournament organisers deemed its off-field facilities unsuitable for a World Cup.

Meanwhile, ER2015 sold 200,000 tickets between November and Christmas Day, suggesting a campaign promoting buying tickets as Christmas presents proved successful.

Sky Sports have predictably taken up their option to extend their TV rights contract with the ECB until 2019. 

But this monopoly of live Test cricket comes when two county chief executives, Surrey’s Richard Gould and Yorkshire’s Mark Arthur, have gone public about the need for terrestrial TV exposure to arrest falling participation numbers and dwindling interest in domestic Twenty20.

ITV drop Townsend

ITV Sport, having lost their FA Cup and live Champions League and Europa League rights, will not be renewing the contracts of pundit Andy Townsend and presenter Matt Smith at the end of the season.

The decision was mutual with Townsend, one of the best operators in the difficult role of co-commentator. He wants to work on live football and has offers from international broadcasters.

However, shedding football personnel doesn’t say much about ITV’s ambitions to take Match of the Day highlights off the BBC in the Premier League TV rights auction next month.

David Gill, Manchester United director and England candidate for FIFA’s British vice-presidency, prefers to conduct his football business away from the spotlight. 

So it’s surprising Gill has agreed to talk about the contentious subject of third-party football ownership at a conference in Lisbon next week.

It has emerged Sport England, who spent more than £2m on the flawed SPOGO website to highlight facilities nationwide, used web developers based in Russia. 

However, this arrangement will cease when SPOGO — that was hardly used despite the massive cost — is merged soon with London 2012 legacy site Be Inspired. A Sport England spokesman said: ‘Lots of companies do this to keep costs down and get access to specific expertise.’
