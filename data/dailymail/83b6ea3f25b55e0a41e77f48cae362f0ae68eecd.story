A rare Nazi bling-ring once owned by Adolf Hitler is going up for auction in Maryland next week and is expected to fetch at least £70,000.

The 'Hitler Ring' is made of silver and was 
originally plated with gold, though not much is left after 75 
years.

On the ring is a huge swastika that is supported by other 
swastikas and swords. The piece is crowned by a large ruby and mounted 
in a silver globe which rests on an elaborate foot, also with a swastika.

The ring was made for Adolf Hitler by fanatical Nazi goldsmith Karl Berthold

Set on an elaborate base and inside a silver ball, the ring is made from solid silver and topped with a huge ruby.

Whether the dictator ever wore the kitschy item is unknown, but the fact that is was made for him will be enough to drive prices sky high for collectors of Nazi militaria when bidding begins next week.

Though an official certificate shows it was made for Hitler, we have no way of knowing if he wore it

It is being offered for sale by the Alexander Historical Auctions House in Maryland and comes with documents come with it testifying that it was made for the Fuhrer.

The ring was crafted by the master goldsmith Karl Berthold who was a fanatical Nazi and kicked Jewish craftsmen out of his business in Frankfurt shortly after the regime came to power in 1933 - long before laws forbidding them from working came into place.

He wrote to Hitler saying he had fired the "Bolshevik-Jew servants" and was commissioned by a party functionary to make the ring for the Nazi leader.

The ring was found at Berchtesgaden, Hitler's mountain retreat in Bavaria, in 1945 by American troops.

One of the soldiers pocketed it as a souvenir before selling it on. It was owned by several collectors over the years, the last of whom died two years ago and whose grandson is now selling it.

The Alexander Historical Auctions House is famous for selling Nazi-themed militaria and artefacts. 

Three years ago it sold the diaries of Auschwitz 'Angel of Death' Josef Mengele - the camp doctor who performed terrible medical experiments on inmates - that he kept while on the run in Brazil.

Another more common kind of Nazi ring is the so-called 'death's head ring' awarded by Heinrich Himmler, the chief engineer of the Holocaust, to officers he considered particularly loyal or courageous.

One such ring was auctioned at Northamptonshire-based JP Humbert Auctioneers in 2008.

It had been signed by Himmler (pictured right) himself and was dated to commemorate the Night of the Long Knives, when Hitler purged a section of his own paramilitary which he considered to be challenging his authority.

A second death ring was stolen from a museum in Berchtesgaden in 2005 and was thought to be worth between four and 40 thousand pounds.

The theft prompted a Europe-wide warning from police to collectors to protect their items after Hitler's own gold Nazi party badge was stolen just a few weeks earlier.
