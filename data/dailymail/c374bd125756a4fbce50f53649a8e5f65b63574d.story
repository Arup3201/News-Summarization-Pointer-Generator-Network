Fresh security fears have been raised in Paris after a drone was seen hovering over the current offices of the Charlie Hebdo magazine.

The sighting was one of around a dozen reported over sensitive sites in the French capital in just one day earlier this week.

One of those came from a police officer who claimed he saw an unnamed aircraft flying over the offices of Liberation newspaper where staff from Charlie Hebdo are now based after their building was targeted by Islamic militants in an attack that killed 12 people.

New alert: A drone was seen hovering over the current offices being used by staff at the Charlie Hebdo satirical newspaper (above) following the terror attack on their building that killed 12 people in January

New threat: French law bans small, civilian drones from areas such as nuclear facilities, which are protected by a no-fly zone that spans a 1.6-mile radius and a height of 1,000 metres. The above drone crashed on the grass near the White House in the United States earlier this year

Police pursued the drone, but lost it at the porte de Montreuil, which leads to the ring road southeast of the capital.  

However, it was later spotted at  Porte de Vincennes, where a fanatical accomplice of the Charlie Hebdo killers shot dead four people at a Jewish supermarket, the Daily Telegraph reported. 

Another drone sighting was reported over eastern Paris where witnesses saw three men retrieve the aircraft and drive off in a black car before police could arrest them, a police source said.

No arrests were made over the flights, which also reportedly took place near the River Seine, the Place de la Concorde and the Invalides military museum.

French police have vowed to track down and
arrest the operators of the drones amid fears from the public they could be used to attach explosives or toxic chemicals.

Earlier this week, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told
parliament that some 60 drone flights over Paris and over
nuclear power plants had been reported since October 5.  

Tension: In other sightings, drones were also seen flying around the  Eiffel Tower earlier this year

Drones were also spotted flying near the Invalides military museum, where Napoleon Bonaparte is buried

Flights over Paris without authorisation from aviation
authorities are illegal, as is the use of airspace up to 1,000
metres above a nuclear site.

'We need to be very vigilant on this, we're going to have to
be extremely careful,' government spokesman Stephane Le Foll
told France Info radio, referring to the drones. 

'The day that
we find the people who are doing this, there will be penalties... we will find them, sooner or later.'

France is still on high alert following a series of attacks
in January that killed 20 people, including three attackers.

Interior Minister Cazeneuve also told parliament he wanted
to equip police with 'new legal tools' to crack down on the
illegal use of drones in sensitive areas. 

On Tuesday, a court fined a British journalist 1,000 euros ($1,100) for flying a drone over central Paris and confiscated his machine.

Tristan Redman, 34, from the Qatar-based network Al-Jazeera, was arrested last month in the Bois de Boulogne park on the western edge of the French capital along with two other journalists.

The two others were released and Redman pleaded guilty to flying a drone over the capital, which is illegal under French law.

France remains on high alert after jihadist attacks in and around the French capital in January left 17 people dead.
