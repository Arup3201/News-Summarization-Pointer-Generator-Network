The instigator: Carl Gross Jr. called police to warn father Carl Gross Sr was a danger to his family

Police in Pennsylvania are being sued after a 2012 incident where they shot a 76-year-old man six times with a Taser gun – because the officers thought he was his brother.

Allentown cops approached Robert Gross in the parking lot of a Walmart shopping center, threw him to the ground and repeatedly Tazed him because they thought he was Carl Gross Sr – who stood by and watched.

The fuzz were on the scene because Robert Gross’ nephew Carl Gross Jr called 911 to warn his father was dangerous, according to WFMZ.

Robert Gross drove his brother to the shopping center to visit his granddaughter at the Cost Cutters hair salon, he claims in the suit.

Police approached the two men in the parking lot, screamed and threw him to the ground before shooting him with the Taser guns, the suit claims.

When Robert Gross asked why he was be brutalized by the officers, they replied ‘you know.’

The cops then tossed him in a squad car and placed him under arrest.

The mix-up was only cleared up during a later court date, but the damage was already done. Robert Gross claims he suffered chest pains so bad he felt he might not survive.

Police charged Robert Gross with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct.

‘We argued that the cops mistook him (Robert) for his brother and tried to take him into custody,’ Attorney Kathryn Roberts told the Philadelphia Enquirer. ‘They didn’t dispute that they Tasered him. They didn’t dispute that he got slammed face down to the ground.’

Police insisted during the trial that Robert Gross ‘was argumentative and belligerent and trying to punch them,’ Roberts recalled, adding that he disputed their version of events.

The elderly man was found guilty of disorderly conduct, a violation.

He is seeking $50,000 in damages as well as interest and other costs.
