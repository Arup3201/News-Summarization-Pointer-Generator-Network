Lukas Podolski has insisted Arsenal's domestic season is not over because Chelsea will not run away with the Premier League like Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga.

The 29-year-old striker also said he wants talks with Arsene Wenger as he continues to be left out of the battle to turn the club's season around.

Arsenal have dropped 12 points behind Chelsea after only 11 matches but ahead of the visit of Manchester United on Saturday, Podolski believes the competitive nature of the Premier League means the curtain cannot be brought down on the title race just yet.

The German forward said that England is not like Spain or Germany where one team can dominate the league

He said: 'You can always speak about problems but the season is not finished. The Premier League is the best league in the world. It is not like in Spain where you have two teams or in Germany where you have just Bayern Munich.

'Here you see it every week that every game is tough. Home and away every team is hard to play and you can never say that the three points are easy to get. In other leagues a team might have only three top games in a season but not here. We lost our last game and it's a big match against Manchester United so we have to win it.'

The German forward is yet to start this season in the league and has made only four appearances. His international coach Joachim Low has warned that he needs to be playing regularly next year or face being left out of the squad for Germany's next qualifier against Georgia at the end of March.

Podolski said: 'I have to speak to Wenger because the situation at the moment is not good for me. I have to play. I am happy at Arsenal and happy in London but I don't have the chance to play.

'I know that only 11 can play but when you come on for just 10 or 15 minutes and it happens every week then you cannot be happy. I am happy with the team and the coach and the club, but I am not playing and I cannot be happy with that. I have to speak to Wenger because the situation at the moment is not good for me.'

Podolski would like an emotional return to Cologne but Arsenal want £4 million for the World Cup winner if he goes in January and the Bundesliga club's sporting director Jorg Schmadkte told Bild this week: 'We don't have that money and we can neither pay the transfer fee nor the salary of a player like Podolski.'

Arsenal face United with both teams out of the European places and Podolski said: 'There is always pressure when you are at a big club and you are not in the top four. We know we have to start winning games and picking up points.'

Asked about Arsenal's ability to put a late run of wins together that always manages to put Wenger's team in the Champions League, Podolski said: 'We are capable of that but it would be better that we don't have that run and we make first place and end up as champions.

'It's a long season and there is a long way to go. So far it is not a bad or a good season. We are still there or thereabouts but we have to win games. We have to focus on our game and if we are ready, and if we fight hard, then we will win this game because Manchester United are not where they want to be at the moment. Our players will not need no motivating for this game.'

The arrival of Alexis Sanchez has pushed Podolski further down the pecking order. He is not surprised by the speed at which the former Barcelona forward has adapted to English football.

He said: 'The Premier League is good for him. He is a physical player. He is fast and powerful and the Premier League suits him. He is battling in every game and running a lot and he is making the difference at the moment at Arsenal.'
