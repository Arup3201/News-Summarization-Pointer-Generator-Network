South Korea will strike back quickly if the North stages any attack on its territory, the new president in Seoul warned on Monday, as tensions ratcheted higher on the Korean peninsula amid shrill rhetoric from Pyongyang and the U.S. deployment of radar-evading fighter planes.

North Korea says the region is on the brink of a nuclear war in the wake of United Nations sanctions imposed for its February nuclear test and a series of joint U.S. and South Korean military drills that have included a rare U.S. show of aerial power.

The rogue state announced on Saturday it was entering a 'state of war' with South Korea in response to what it termed the 'hostile' military drills being staged in the South.Â

Yesterday, its top 
decision-making body said nuclear weapons are 'treasure' and the 
'nation's life' and will not be traded for billions of dollars.

But there have been no signs of 
unusual activity in the North's military to suggest an imminent 
aggression, a South Korean defence ministry official said last week.

'If
there is any provocation against South Korea and its people, there 
should be a strong response in initial combat without any political 
considerations,' President Park Geun-hye told the defence minister and 
senior officials at a meeting on Monday.

The
South has changed its rules of engagement to allow local units to 
respond immediately to attacks, rather than waiting for permission from 
Seoul.

Stung by criticism that its response 
to the shelling of a South Korean island in 2010 was tardy and weak, 
Seoul has also threatened to target North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and 
to destroy statues of the ruling Kim dynasty in the event of any new 
attack, a plan that has outraged Pyongyang.

Seoul
and its ally the United States played down Saturday's statement from 
the official KCNA news agency as the latest in a stream of tough talk 
from Pyongyang.

North Korea stepped up its rhetoric 
in early March, when U.S. and South Korean forces began annual military 
drills that involved the flights of U.S. B-2 stealth bombers in a 
practice run, prompting the North to puts its missile units on standby 
to fire at U.S. military bases in the South and in the Pacific.

The
United States also deployed F-22 stealth fighter jets on Sunday to take
part in the drills. The F-22s were deployed in South Korea before, in 
2010.

On its part, North 
Korea has cancelled an armistice agreement with the United States that 
ended the Korean War and cut all hotlines with U.S. forces, the United 
Nations and South Korea.

Park's
intervention came on the heels of a meeting of the North's ruling 
Workers Party Central Committee where leader Kim Jong-un rejected the 
notion that Pyongyang was going to use its nuclear arms development as a
bargaining chip.

'The 
nuclear weapons of Songun Korea are not goods for getting U.S. dollars 
and they are ... (not) to be put on the table of negotiations aimed at 
forcing the (North) to disarm itself,' KCNA news agency quoted him as 
saying.

At the 
meeting, Kim appointed a handful of personal confidants to the party's 
politburo, further consolidating his grip on power in the second full 
year of his reign.

Pyongyang
took part in nuclear disarmament talks for five years aimed at paying 
it off in return for abandoning its atomic weapons programme.

Those
talks fell apart in 2008. Some experts say the talks gave the North 
grounds to pursue a highly enriched uranium programme that took it 
closer to owning a working arsenal.

Songun
is the Korean word for the 'Military First' policy preached by Kim's 
father who used it to justify the use of the impoverished state's scare 
resources to build a 1.2-million strong army and a weapons of mass 
destruction programme.

Escalation: North Korea said on Saturday it was entering a 'state of war' with South Korea in response to what it termed the 'hostile' military drills being staged in the South

Anger: North Korea is furious at the recent UN sanctions imposed for its February nuclear test

White House National Security Council
spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said North Korea's announcement that it was 
in a state of war followed a 'familiar pattern' of rhetoric. China has repeatedly called for restraint on the peninsula.

However, many in South Korea have 
regarded the North's willingness to keep open the Kaesong industrial 
zone, located just a few miles (km) north of the heavily-militarised 
border and operated jointly by both sides, as a sign that Pyongyang will
not risk losing a lucrative source of foreign currency by mounting a 
real act of aggression.

The
Kaesong zone is a vital source of hard currency for the North and 
hundreds of South Korean workers and vehicles enter daily after crossing
the armed border.

It 
was still open on Monday despite threats by Pyongyang to shut it down. 
Closure could also trap hundreds of South Korean workers and managers of
the more than 100 firms that have factories there.

The
North has previously suspended operations at the factory zone at the 
height of political tensions with the South, only to let it resume 
operations later.

The 
United States has sent F-22 stealth fighter jets to join South Korean 
military exercises in a show of support for Seoul as it urged North 
Korea to restrain itself from making threats against the South and its 
allies.

Yesterday, the North's top decision-making body said nuclear weapons are 'treasure' and the
'nation's life' and will not be traded for billions of dollars, the 
latest in a series of provocative statements from the rogue state.

'[North Korea] will achieve nothing by 
threats or provocations, which will only further isolate North Korea and
undermine international efforts to ensure peace and stability in 
north-east Asia,' the US said in a statement.
