British Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday is in danger of turning into a very damp squib after two more big names joined the list of absentees.

Torrential rain turning the track heavy in places has convinced Kevin Ryan not to run French Derby winner The Grey Gatsby. Also out is Clive Brittain’s Coronation Stakes winner Rizeena.

A combination of injury, end-of-season fatigue, alternative targets and unsuitable ground means Australia, Kingman, Kingston Hill, Slade Power, Sole Power plus Mukhadram and Taghrooda, whose retirements were confirmed on Monday, will also be absent.

This is not what organisers dreamed when they created this end-of-season finale but it is certainly what they were warned might happen given Champions Day’s place in the calendar.

The only 2014 Classic winner due to run is Richard Hannon’s 2,000 Guineas victor Night Of Thunder in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes.

Hannon has added Pether’s Moon to the Champion Stakes, one of seven supplementary entries now fancying their chances of grabbing a share of the £4million up for grabs.

‘The race is cutting up a bit and looks like something we should be having a go at,’ said Hannon.

The testing ground will reignite calls for Ascot to look at ways of covering the course. Spokesman Nick Smith said: ‘We have had presentations from people with ideas but it isn’t straight- forward. It is a tentative but possible scenario.’
