An eccentric Australian businessman who is contesting this weekend’s general election claimed today that Rupert Murdoch’s ex-wife Wendi Deng is a Chinese spy ‘and that’s why Rupert got rid of her.’

Multi-millionaire Clive Palmer, 59, renowned for his plans to construct a replica of the Titanic in conjunction with a Chinese company and for his dreams of creating an animated Jurassic Park in Queensland, also said today that he was planning to sue Mr Murdoch.

He was furious about an article in a Murdoch newspaper, The Australian, which questioned his wealth and whether he was a university professor and a mining magnate, as he claims.

Claims: Clive Palmer, an eccentric Australian businessman who is contesting this weekend's general election claimed today that Rupert Murdoch's ex-wife Wendi Deng is a Chinese spy 'and that's why Rupert got rid of her'

In his attack on Mr Murdoch he did not exclude the media magnate’s former wife, Miss Deng - who will be remembered for her defence of her husband when she prevented a protester from smashing a pie into his face during the hacking inquiry before the House of Commons Select Committee in July 2011.

‘You know Rupert Murdoch’s wife Wendi Deng is a Chinese spy and that’s been right across the world,’ he claimed during an interview on the Channel Nine tv network.

‘She’s been spying on Rupert for years, giving money back to Chinese intelligence.

‘She was trained in southern China. I’m telling you the truth.

‘Wendi Deng is a Chinese spy and that’s why Rupert got rid of her.’ 

Along with his claims, Mr Palmer, who 
insists his Palmer United Party will win ‘a lot of Senate seats and a 
lot of House of Representative seats’ in the upcoming election, said he 
was going ahead with his determination to sue Mr Murdoch for the article
 attacking his credibility.

The Australian newspaper said that ‘contrary to the flim-flam and spin, Clive Frederick Palmer is not a professor, not an adviser to the G20, not a mining magnate, not a legal guru and not an advocate for freedom of speech. He’s probably not a billionaire.’

He accused Australian-born Mr Murdoch, who is now a US citizen, of ordering his reporters what to write and said the media magnate needed to be brought to account.

‘Murdoch will be sued by me today and will be brought to Australia to answer these questions in the Supreme Court,’ he told the Seven Network. ‘It’s time this fellow was brought to account, this foreigner who tries to dictate what we do.’
