An unsettling video has emerged purporting to show Islamic State fighters bartering over Yazidi women at a slave girl 'market'.

The terror organisation recently boasted of enslaving women from the Iraqi ethnic minority, and the men appearing in the clip explain it is 'slave market day'.

The clip shows the men negotiating the price of the women, with blue and green-eyed young girls fetching a higher price.

Disturbing: The clip begins with this bearded Islamic State fighter explaining it is slave 'distribution day'  

'We should have our share': ISIS have said captured Yazidi women are divided 'according to Sharia law' 

One unidentified man, pictured left, says he is searching for a girl while another man sitting next to him laughs

Who wants to sell? A man asks who has a slave to sell and one is quickly found and negotiations begin

Exchange: The seller quickly reveals he is happy to part with his young slave girl for Glock pistol

Haggle: But the buyers want to know what the girl looks like before they name a price

It starts with one man saying to the camera: 'Today is the slave market day. Today is the day where this verse applies: 'Except with their wives and the (captives) whom their right hands possess, - for (then) they are not too be blamed'.

He added: 'Today is distribution day God willing. Each one takes his share.'

Another then says: 'I swear man I am searching for a girl. I hope I find one.'

The men laugh and another says: 'Today is the day of (female) slaves and we should have our share.'

Bartering begins after a seller is found, who says he is happy to sell his slave for a Glock pistol.

Sellers offer prices, with one going as high as five banknotes. Subtitles on the clip explain that one banknote is probably the equivalent of 100 dollars. 

Barter: The men begin to negotiate a price with the seller, with some offering money and one offering a gun 

Picky: But the buyers explain the price depends on the young girl's looks and they will need to check her teeth 

But the buyers explain the price they are willing to pay depends on looks and they will need to verify the girl is to their liking.

One says he would need to check the teeth of the 15-year-old being auctioned, and explains: 'If she doesn't have teeth, why would I want her?'

The video was shot in Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, which was seized by ISIS in June, according to Al Aan TV - who translated the clip into English. 

The group have been reported as saying that Yazidi women and children captured during the offensive in Sinjar town were divided among fighters 'according to sharia law'.

Valuable: Blue and green eyes are preferred by the men, who say they will offer a higher price

The men offer money in terms of banknotes, which an English translation says is around 100 dollars

Teeth: But negotiations later stall when it appears the girl, thought to be aged 15, may be missing some teeth

Last month, a young Yazidi woman forced into sex slavery by the Islamic State claimed militants raped her 30 times in just a few hours.

The unidentified woman is understood to have been kept as a prisoner of the jihadists somewhere in western Iraq having been captured by ISIS during the Sinjar massacre in early August.

She allegedly told the fighters she had been raped so frequently that she could no longer use the toilet, adding the ordeal has been so harrowing that she plans to commit suicide even if freed. 

And a 15-year-old girl told how she escaped militants by drugging and shooting two husbands who bought her as a slave.

The teenager, who has been kept anonymous to protect her family, was one of hundreds of women from the Yazidi sect who extremists kidnapped after overrunning their homes on Iraq's Mount Sinjar.   

The UN have confirmed that thousands of Yazidis were slaughtered when ISIS swept through northern Iraq in August.

Researchers concluded that more than 5,000 Yazidi were gunned down in a series of massacres by jihadists.

Thousands of women are also being held in makeshift detention centres, where they either been taken away and sold into slavery or handed over to jihadists as concubines. 

The clip begins with one man addressing the camera: Today is the slave market day. Today is the day where this verse applies: 'Except with their wives and the (captives) whom their right hands possess, - for (then) they are not too be blamed'.

Today is distribution day God willing. Each one takes his share.

Another then says: I swear man I am searching for a girl. I hope I find one.

Another adds: Today is the day of (female) slaves and we should have our share.

The bartering begins with the words: Who wants to sell?

The seller's reply: I want to sell. 

Why?

I pay three banknotes (Subtitles explain one banknote is probably 100 dollars)

I buy her for a pistol.

The price differs if she has blue eyes.

The seller replies: I will sell her for a Glock!

I pay five banknotes.

It depends on how she looks like.

If she is 15 years old, I have to check her... Check her teeth.

If she has green eyes...

If she doesn't have teeth, why would I want her?
