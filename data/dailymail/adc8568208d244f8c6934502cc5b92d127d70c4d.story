Betting shop managers are being told their wages are to be directly linked to how much cash punters pour in to a new generation of high stakes gaming machines branded a ‘social cancer’.

A leaked memo reveals that staff at one of Britain’s biggest bookmakers have been told ‘higher weighting’ is to be attached to profits from fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs).

Critics of the machines, which allow users to wager up to £100 a spin every 20 seconds, say they are highly addictive and make casino-style gambling accessible on the high street.

Leak: The move by Betfred will fuel growing calls for the Government to curb the terminals

Britain’s 33,000 FOBTs – branded the ‘crack cocaine’ of gambling – have been under mounting scrutiny in recent months. They are increasingly key to the bookmaking industry, now raking in more than £1billion a year in profit.

The move by Betfred will fuel growing calls for the Government to curb the terminals. Campaigners want stakes to be cut to a maximum of £2, a reduction in spin rates and a ban on offers of free stakes intended to draw in new punters.

Betfred, named after its co-founder Fred Done, has 1,375 betting shops across the country, in locations ranging from inner cities to leafy suburbs and rural towns.

An internal company memo, setting out a proposed ‘restructure announcement’, shows sales managers will attract ‘per hour’ supplements of 25p, 75p or £1.25 depending on how their shop is graded on three performance indicators. As well as traditional over-the-counter slips and stakes, it says they will include ‘FOBT gross profit (which will attract a higher weighting)’.

The Daily Mail has also seen documents suggesting that some Betfred stores intend to trade until 9pm on Christmas Eve, Boxing Day, New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day, hours after racing has finished – though the firm insisted last night the vast majority would now close at 6.30pm.

Gambling machine: calls are growing to restrict the stakes and prizes available on fixed-odds betting machines

Adrian Parkinson, from the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, said: ‘The proposed restructure is cynically aimed at incentivising shop staff to increase revenue from addictive digital roulette machines in order to increase their hourly wage. It entirely contradicts their commitment to social responsibility.’

Labour MP Tom Watson said: ‘This is an utterly cynical and avaricious measure that is ruining horse racing, destroying bookmaking and creating problem gamblers.’ Conservative MP Stewart Jackson said: ‘There has been significant criticism of the pernicious effect these machines are having. We need to think about the impact not just on problem gamblers but their families.’

A spokesman for Betfred said: ‘Betfred has announced to its staff a proposed restructuring of the company’s shop estate, which we believe will help drive the business forward and give all our employees a defined career path. It is however incorrect to state that the grading of the shops is based purely on gross profit from the fixed odds betting terminals.

‘The grading is based on three factors that reflect the business of a high street betting shop: the number of over-the-counter slips taken, over-the-counter stakes, and gross profit from the fixed odds betting terminals. To do otherwise would be unfair on our staff.’

The Gambling Commission says it is taking time to review FOBTs.
