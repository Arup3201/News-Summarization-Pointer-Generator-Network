As London Fashion Week gets underway, fashionistas everywhere will be trying to outdo each other this weekend. And here's one accessory that's sure to make you stand out - and give you a picture to prove it.

A 20-year-old designer who has dressed Lady Gaga and Rita Ora has created a giant, glittery selfie-taking sombrero.

The bright pink number is the result of a collaboration between London-based Christian Cowan-Sanluis and Acer, and features a top of the range tablet dangling off the side.

The £599 couture hat spins 360 degrees - helping selfie lovers find their best angle - and is available through appointment only. 

Dubbed the 'Christian Cowan-Sanluis x Acer Selfie-Hat', the piece combines the designer's unique and playful style with the Taiwanese tech firm's top-notch technology.

The hat's sparkly pink design is inspired by Cowan-Sanluis' AW14 collection. No starnger to outrageous outfits, Lady Gaga was pictured earlier this year in a version of the hat (minus the tablet) which she teamed with a matching glittery pink suit.

The high tech version comes with a tablet that spins while being worn and helps detect the user's best angle whilst the selfie camera is activated, letting them snap and review photos from any angle desired. 

The selfie sombrero helps the user understand lighting and how various expressions can change your face to create the perfect social media moment.

Users can then access apps such as Facebook or Instagram whilst wearing the hat to up load their selfies instantly and share them with the world.

Christian Cowan-Sanluis is a first year fashion student at London College of Fashion but has already worked with some of the world's most A-list fashion icons. 

He has already presented several collections at London Fashion Week, and Acer say his unique style was the perfect match for their selfie hat project.

'We wanted to work with someone young and fresh, that not only understands the selfie culture, but both currently is part of it and works with people in it', said an Acer spokesman.

Cowan-Sanluis explains: 'With the hat, we wanted to take an element from my last collection, but correspondingly integrate the most popular zeitgeist there is in technology at the moment, the selfie. 

'We also wanted to give it a fun and playful approach, but that in the end helps the user to better understand their face when taking a self-portrait.

'There has been a lot of articles over the last year looking at how the selfie has gotten so big and being monetised on, celebrities such as Kim Kardashian making a selfie book and the term becoming part of mainstream society. 

'But on the other side, a lot of people taking selfies struggle to find the full potential of their front-facing camera when they use their hand. The hat helps to perfect the shot, either if it's a cute, sexy or silly selfie.'

Not afraid to stand out from the crowd: Lady Gaga wore a version of the hat earlier this year

A Selfie-Hat service provides you with a personal introduction to the hat with consultation from Christian Cowan-Sanluis, but it's only available in central London.

The hat will also be available on display during Christian Cowan-Sanluis fashion presentation at LFW today.

As part of the collaboration, the pair have also created 10 limited edition pink sparkly glitter cases with accompanying hats in the same style as that worn by Lady Gaga.

'We wanted to create something to accompany the hat, so the mini-cases are highly sought after and we've already had a few celebrity requests for these exclusive tablets', explains Cowan-Sanluis.
