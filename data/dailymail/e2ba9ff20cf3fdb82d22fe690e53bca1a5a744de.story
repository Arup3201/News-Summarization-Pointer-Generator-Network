Paying the jobless over-generous benefits does not make them happy, a new Europe-wide study reveals.

Researchers at the University of Edinburgh also insisted that extra welfare does not make the unemployed lazy and less likely to look for work.

Instead motivation levels of those without a job are more likely to be affected by the way society views them.

Employment levels across Europe vary widely, in part as countries struggle with the impact of the eurozone crisis

Researchers at the University of Edinburgh compared how unemployment affected people's life satisfaction in all European Union countries and Norway, and found there was no over-riding trend.

The well-being of jobless people is not affected by the level of benefit they receive, they found.

Dr Jan Eichhorn, of the University of Edinburgh's School of Social and Political Science, said: ‘Those who claim that greater unemployment benefits lead to less motivation for people to seek employment should think again - for most people, it is not the degree of state provisions that determines how they personally feel about the experience of being unemployed.

‘Unemployment does not just result in a loss of income but also a change in social position - that is perceived differently in different societies.’

Rates of unemployment vary across Europe, with many countries still struggling under the impacts of the Eurozone crisis.

In the UK, the unemployment rate has fallen to 7.6 per cent, closer to the 7 per cent target set by the Bank of England before interest rates could rise.

But in Spain and Greece it remains at more than a quarter, and is around 17 per cent in Cyprus and Croatia.

The study used data from Eurostat and the European Values Study to examine how the jobless in different countries are motivated to find work.

It found that some of the countries with the most generous benefits have the greatest loss in life satisfaction for their unemployed, and vice versa.

For example, Luxembourg and Finland are in the top 25 per cent for unemployment benefits expenditure yet have high levels of dissatisfaction in people without jobs.

The reverse is true for Romania and Poland, which are in the bottom 25 per cent for benefit provision while their unemployed are among the least affected.

The UK is ranked in the mid 50 per cent 
for the level of benefits provided to the country's unemployed and is 
ranked as 18th for the extent of loss in life-satisfaction of the 
jobless.

It was concluded that cultural and demographic factors have a greater impact on the lives of jobless people, such as having no job in a country that has a proportionally older population and fewer people at working age.

Other factors highlighted by the report as having a negative impact on personal well-being were high inflation levels and income inequality.

The country with the highest level of dis-satisfied unemployed people was Germany, with a rate that was 50 per cent higher than second-placed Hungary.

At the bottom of the table was Romania, which is also in the bottom 25 per cent for benefit provision, while Spain is in the top 25 per cent for benefits expenditure yet unemployed citizens remain relatively unaffected, with the country sitting above Romania in 27th position.
