A state appeals court has ruled that a Long Island father used reasonable force when he spanked his eight-year-old son for cursing at an adult.

Newsday reports that the state Appellate Division dismissed a child neglect proceeding against the man last week.

The father had used the disciplinary action in October 2012 during a party at a friend's house.

Within his rights: A Long Island father has been cleared of a neglect ruling previously filed against him after spanking his eight-year-old son at a party, with an appellate court finding he used 'reasonable force' for the situation

The Suffolk County social service department alleged he used an open hand and a belt on the boy's buttocks, legs and arms after they got home.

The incident occurred in March 2013.

A county family court later found the father in neglect.

The identifies of the father and the child were suppressed as art of the family court ruling.

The appellate division has now said under the circumstances the spanking 'did not constitute excessive corporal punishment'.

'The father's openhanded spanking of the child as a form of discipline after he heard the child curse at an adult was a reasonable use of force,' the appeals court ruling said.

The neglect ruling was dismissed, the court said, because evidence collected at a fact-finding hearing that the father hit his son with a belt 'was insufficient to prove that allegation'.
