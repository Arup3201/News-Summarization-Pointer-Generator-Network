When businessman Ian Bury discovered and detained a suspected metal thief carrying a crowbar, wire strippers, cutters and a screwdriver, at his lighting firm, he assumed it was an open and shut case.

But to his astonishment, police told him the alleged criminal - caught ‘bang to rights’ hiding at the scene - had been released without charge due to a lack of evidence.

The head of a lighting company, which that week had been broken into four times, has spoken of his anger at the outcome.

Raided: Ian Bury thought he had caught the suspected metal thief 'bang to rights' when he discovered a man hiding at his lighting firm building

He said: ‘We couldn’t believe he was let off.’

The incident which led to the suspect’s arrest was the second in 48 hours at Mr Bury’s company, Sparkbrook-based Luminaire.

Thieves first struck at the premises, in Statford Street North, on May 13, then again on May 15 and for a third time on May 16.

Copper piping was taken on each occasion and Mr Bury said the site suffered a fourth break-in on May 19 - but there was nothing left to take.

Mr Bury, 48, said he and some colleagues were making his company’s base secure after the first break-in when they disturbed intruders on May 15.

Furious: Ian Bury's lighting firm had been repeatedly targeted by metal thieves who had stripped his premises of valuable cables and left a trail of destruction

‘In the first raid, the boiler was ripped from the wall and copper pipes, cable and radiators were all taken,’ he said.

‘We must have disturbed the intruders on the second time. One ran off down a passage, down the fire escape route and disappeared.’

Mr Bury and his colleagues caught a second suspect hiding beneath a pile of cardboard and called the West Midlands Police.

But the businessman took a call the next day informing him it had been decided there was not enough evidence to prosecute.

And the firm, which employs 30 people, was then burgled for a third time that night.

A police spokesman said the force had no record of the May 19 raid, but added: ‘We can confirm we are investigating three burglaries at a building on Stratford Street North in Sparkbrook.

Ransacked: Ian Bury inspects some of the damage done during several raids on his lighting firm by metal thieves in the space of a few days

‘One person was arrested on May 15 on suspicion of burglary but was later released without charge. The decision on whether to charge, bail or release a suspect is always made based on the evidence available at the time.

Police patrols were stepped up in the area following the initial burglary.’

Det Sgt John Jacob added: ‘This is still an active investigation and we are following up a number of lines of enquiry. We are also looking to improve CCTV coverage of the area.

‘We will continue to use a wide range of tactics, both overt and covert, to stamp out metal theft; a crime which brings misery to all of the community.’
