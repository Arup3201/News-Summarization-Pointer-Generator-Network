Ukip last night warned they will target Boris Johnson over his support for a migrant amnesty if the Conservatives try to use him to erode their support.

Tory sources yesterday confirmed that the London Mayor will be deployed as a ‘Ukip killer’ in next year’s general election, following confirmation that he wants to return to parliament.

Mr Johnson has agreed to carry out a tour of key marginal seats, where Conservative strategists believe he may be able to persuade traditional voters who have defected to Ukip to return to the Tory fold.

Nigel Farage, right, has warned the Conservative Party that he will target Boris Johnson over migrant amnesty

But Nigel Farage dismissed the threat, saying Ukip would highlight his views on immigration, including support for an amnesty for illegal immigrants.

Mr Farage, who was selected to fight Thanet South, in Kent, on Tuesday night, told the Daily Mail: ‘If Boris wants to explain to our voters why he supports an amnesty for illegal immigrants then he is very welcome to – and we will do what we can to help.

‘Of course Boris is very engaging and entertaining and he will appeal to parts of the Tory grassroots. But, as we pointed out yesterday, he is more Oxbridge than Uxbridge - our voters want representatives who stand up for the concerns of ordinary people whose voice is not heard.’

Mr Johnson has been positioning himself as a Eurosceptic recently. But he takes a much softer line on immigration than either Ukip or David Cameron. As recently as April this year, he attacked the government’s ‘crazy’ immigration crackdown, and he has spoken out repeatedly in favour of an amnesty for illegal immigrants who have been in the UK for years – a policy that even Nick Clegg has now abandoned.

Mr Farage said he was ‘very confident’ that Ukip will win its first seats in parliament next year – and said he would quit as leader if the party fails to make the breakthrough.

The Conservative Party are planning to use Boris Johnson's popularity to block the Ukip threat 

‘The old idea that we cannot win seats at Westminster has gone,’ he said. ‘I am very confident we are going to win some seats – I can’t tell you how many – and in a tight, hung parliament we could even hold the balance of power. If that happens we will drive a very hard bargain that makes sure the British people get a full, free and fair referendum on our continued membership of the EU.’

Mr Johnson has been burnishing his Eurosceptic credentials in recent weeks as part of a drive to position him both to take on Ukip and to eventually replace Mr Cameron as Tory leader.

In a significant intervention this month, Mr Johnson went much further than the Prime Minister on the possibility leaving the EU, saying Britain had ‘nothing to be afraid’ as it could go on to forge a ‘great and glorious future’ if it cut itself free from the shackles of ‘job-destroying’ Brussels.

Mr Johnson and Mr Cameron are said to have made a secret pact under which the Prime Minister would give his old friend and rival a fair wind to return to Westminster in return for the London Mayor pledging not to destabilise his leadership.

Mr Johnson will tour marginal seats in the coming months to drive home the Tory message that voting Ukip risks putting Ed Miliband in Number 10.

Speaking in the wake of his decision on Tuesday to ‘whack in’ an application to become Tory MP for the safe west London seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, he said: ‘A vote for Ukip will kill our chance of a referendum and a renegotiation on Europe. The EU needs reform and only David Cameron and the Conservatives offer that hope.

‘A vote for Ukip Is a vote for Labour – it will give voters who want change, who want to take powers back, exactly the opposite.’
