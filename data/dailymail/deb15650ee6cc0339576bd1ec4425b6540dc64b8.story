An American couple in Texas who officially became the parents of two Congolese orphans in June are still fighting to meet their children and have no idea when their family may finally be whole.

Laura and Greg Richardson became heartbroken and desperate when the African nation halted all adoptions to America in September before Josias and Mercy could make the trip to the states.

Officials in Congo say they fear the kids sent abroad could be mistreated, while the well-off and God-fearing parents of four biological children want the 15- and 18-month old boy and girl out of the war ravaged nation as soon as possible.

Eager: Laura Richardson (left with one of her four biological children) is in an adoption nether realm. She and husband Greg officially became the parents of two Congolese orphans in June, but the African nation froze all adoptions to the U.S. before the children could make it to their new home

Great need: The Richardsons have four biological children aged 2 through 8, and decided to adopt from Congo, where 4 million children live as orphans

'It’s just
 heartbreaking,' Laura Richardson told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. 'We
 are watching our children grow up in pictures. We don’t know what’s 
going on over there, if they are healthy or safe.'

The
 Richardsons' plight feels all the more frustrating because the couple 
had already jumped through all the necessary hoops to officially become 
the parents of Josias and Mercy.

'We are legally their parents,' Laura Richardson said. 'It’s irreversible.'

But
 parents or not, the Richardsons are only able to help raise and nurture
 the Congolese children through the prayers and with the hope their 
government's dictate will soon be reversed.

Their struggle is also a race against time in a sense.

While
 the children are currently living together at an orphanage, children in
 the country face daunting odds just to stay alive on a daily basis.

The
 Democratic Republic of the Congo is now longer in the heat of its 
horrific early 2000s civil war, but the conflict's affects remain acute.

'We
 were praying about it for the longest time, trying to figure out where 
we were being called,' Laura Richardson told the Star-Telegram. 'We saw 
the great need in Congo.'

Going to Congo: 'We are just going to meet them and make sure they are OK,' Laura Richardson said. 'We don¿t really expect they will be able to come home at that point'

There are an astonishing four million orphans in Congo, where 1 in 7 children die before their fifth birthday.

The
 Richardsons and families in like situations have until now spent the 
months since adoptions were halted to the U.S. simply hoping that their 
government officials could find a way to intervene.

Now, they've enlisted the help of Texas Senator John Cornyn to try and help in their cause.

There is also an online petition to urge congress to take action that has seen over 100,000 signees since April 2.

'The
 unexpected delay in the completion of these adoptions has resulted in 
over 460 children continuing to languish in institutions without the 
care of a permanent family,' reads the letter.

For now, the frustrated Richardsons are playing the waiting game.

Signs hang on the doors of each of their rooms reading 'Worth the wait.'

While willing to wait, the Richardsons are not complacent. They plan to visit the children in Congo next month.

'We are just going to meet them and make sure they are OK,' Laura Richardson said. 'We don’t really expect they will be able to come home at that point.'
