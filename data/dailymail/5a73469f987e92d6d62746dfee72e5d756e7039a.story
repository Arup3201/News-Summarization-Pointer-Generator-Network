A couple fell to their deaths after a window they were having sex against gave way in China.

The pair are said to have fallen from the window of an apartment block in the Chinese city of Wuhan when the window they were leaning against shattered.

Witnesses told Chinese media that the couple clung to each other as they fell to the pavement outside.

According to The Sun, a source in China said: 'With the two of them holding each other tight, they fell out of the building.'

Shocking pictures emerged on a local website showing the couple being covered in sheets by police.

Blood is spattered on the pavement nearby and detectives are seen examining the scene.

The couple's bodies were pictured close to a bicycle which was laying on the ground, but there were no reports that anyone on the ground was injured in the incident.

Reports suggest that the windows in the apartment block were of poor quality.

It is thought that the man and woman may have been trying to keep cool by the window when the incident happened.

It is unclear how high up the pair were when they fell.

Wuhan is the most populous city in central China.

With a 3,500 year history it is one of the most ancient and civilised cities in China.
