An ex-orthopedic surgeon and an architect claim to have discovered the holy grail of fashion footwear: high heels that are genuinely comfortable.

Dr Taryn Rose, a 47-year-old single mother-of-three based in California, already built a $40 million business with her first namesake shoe collection, and has now launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund her next chapter: 'wing shoes.'

The collection of heels are the brainchild of architect and designer Enrico Cuini, and have specially constructed carbon fiber 'wings' built into the insoles, which support and cushion all three arches of the foot; the medial, lateral and transverse - rather than just the usual one.

The holy grail? Dr Taryn Rose, a former orthopedic surgeon, and architect Enrico Cuini have created a line of high heeled shoes (pictured, the peep-toe sandal) which boast carbon fiber 'wings' built into the insoles

'The wings "flutter" as you walk to provide a pumping action, which helps blood flow back to your heart from your feet,' Dr Rose tells MailOnline. 'This provides comfort and decreases swelling in your feet.'

She adds: 'These wings make your feet feel stable, supported and secure, and gives them a "platform" to rest on so you feel like you are wearing a much lower heel.

'The pressure is relieved from the balls of your feet and your ankle doesn't wobble.'

Mr Cuini came up with the first prototype, after which he approached Dr Rose to come on board. Formerly a European Windsurfing champion, Mr Cuini introduced strong but flexible materials to the shoes that are traditionally used to shape and streamline surfboards.

'Mr Cuini brings a lot of different perspectives and industries to the shoe industry, which hasn't really changed in 100 years,' Dr Rose points out.

The collection includes flip-flips and sneakers as well as classic stilettos, platform stilettos, wedges, peep-toe sandals and booties; all in a range of colors.

Prices start at $350 and run up to $1995, but donors to the Kickstarter campaign are rewarded with shoes from the line at up to a 50per cent discount. As the company builds its customer base, they aim to lower the prices where possible. 

The campaign, which is hoping to raise $100,000 by November 5, will fund the manufacturing molds needed for the new wing technology.

Dr Rose explains: 'We felt that with Kickstarter, it's a way for us to build the community from day one.

'This is a way for someone to be a part of our company from the very beginning whether it's a $5 pledge or a $10,000 pledge.'

She and Mr Cuini have chosen to donate a sizable portion of the net profits from their shoes to philanthropic causes concerning water, education and health; something that might be unattractive to private investors, but she feels is crucial.

So how did Dr Rose make the transition from orthopedic surgeon, to a shoe business she started in her garage, to a multi-millionaire footwear designer?

'As an orthopedic surgeon - and fashionista - I saw women who wanted to wear fashion shoes but suffered from how uncomfortable they can be...especially high heels.

'And of course, I dealt with several broken ankles from women falling off their heels, usually with the help of a few cocktails.'

Construction: Dr Rose enlisted architect and engineer Enrico Cuini to help design the collection, and the Kickstarter campaign will fund the molds used to construct the shoes (pictured)

Dr Rose, who earned her M.D. from the University of Southern California, was the first to use a memory foam-type material called Poron on shoes she crafted for diabetic patients to absorb shock.

She then had the idea to marry the passion she had for her male dominated field - only around ten per cent of foot surgeons were women at the time - and her love of fashion.

She became the first designer to use Poron in a line of fashion shoes, a collection she designed in her garage 17 years ago with Mr Cuini.

'When I saw the prototype that he had made on my kitchen table it took me two seconds to realize, "this is the real deal... the next big revolution in footwear".'

Then and now: Dr Rose had the idea to marry the passion she had for orthopedic surgery with and her love of fashion, and gave up her medical career in 1997 to start her first shoe label, which she sold off in 2008 

Women loved the shoes and Dr Rose sold her first collection to Nordstrom. Over the next ten years, she stopped practicing as a surgeon and built a $40 million revenue business instead.

'Once I had the time to look at what I had accomplished, I realized I'd actually built a great company,' she recalls. 'It was hard to grasp.'

One of the stunts Dr Rose pulled off to prove the merits of her comfortable high heels was to climb 282 steps in a pair of her three-inch pumps.

She sold her Taryn Rose line in 2008 and spent the next eight years planning her next move. Mr Cuini came back on board two years ago, and inspired by a butterfly, the new wing technology was born.

The surgeon-turned-designer, who is mom to Anneka, 14, Milo, 10, and Peter, 9, estimates she owns around 287 pairs of shoes currently.

'It's human nature to want to be desirable, and high heels do wonders for that,' she says.

'They make your legs appear more toned and elongated, your lower back more arched and your "booty" more prominent.'

And for those of us who can't wait for her wing shoes to go to on sale, estimated to be June 2015, Dr Rose gave us her top tips for high heel shoe-shopping so as to to avoid ending up in pain.

'Shop at the end of the day when your feet are most swollen, and look for shoes with some form of padding for your forefoot, since there's a lot of pressure in that region,' she advises.

'Look for shoes with a built-in platform to decrease the actual pitch of the shoe, and try not to go with shoes narrower than 1 cm of your own foot.'
