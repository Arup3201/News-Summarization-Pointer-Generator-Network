A passenger plane was evacuated and grounded for six hours after its pilot and a cabin crew member brawled just before the aircraft was scheduled to take off.

The Saudi Arabian Airlines flight was preparing to depart Cairo’s international airport for Medina, Saudi Arabia when an argument between the captain and steward turned violent.

More than 150 passengers were removed from the plane without injury and taken to a transit hall while officials separated the combatants.

Once security personnel broke up the fist fight, the steward was treated at the airport for hand injuries.

The pilot suffered an eye injury and was transported to hospital, Stuff.co.nz reported. 

‘The fight took place as the plane was about to take off,’ said Col Mutaz Youssef, duty head of the airport police.

The 153 passengers were put back on the plane, which departed about six hours behind schedule.

It is not known what triggered the fight between the pilot and steward.
