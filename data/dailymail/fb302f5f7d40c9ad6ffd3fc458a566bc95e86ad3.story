Mickey Rooney's widow has officially contested the legendary actor's will, which was signed just weeks before his death last month at 93 and completely cut her from his modest estate.

The Hollywood showbiz veteran died on April 6 with $18,000 to his name, leaving it all to his stepson and nothing to his wife of 37 years, Jan Chamberlain - from whom he was estranged - or his other eight children.

In a challenge that will be argued in Los Angeles County Probate Court on Monday, Chamberlain will claim the will contains a 'blatant misstatement' about agreements between her, the actor and his conservator, according to CNN.

A court filing says Jan Chamberlain signed an agreement waiving all claims to her husband's estate after the couple separated in June 2012.

Fight time: A lawyer for Jan Chamberlain says she's filing objections over Mickey Rooney's will, with a hearing to start the process of probating the will set for Monday in los Angeles. The will left Rooney's estate to a stepson and nothing to his wife or other eight children

Mickey Rooney updated his will weeks before his death and left his entire estate - which amounts to $18,000 - to his stepson Mark Rooney (front left) and Mark's wife Charlene (front right), who Rooney lived with in L.A. Rooney's estranged wife Jan Chamberlain (back right) is now contesting

Family ties: Jan Chamberlain, the mother of Chris and Mark Aber, was Mickey Rooney's eighth and final wife. The pair wed in 1978 - but spent the past two years apart. She is now contesting his will after being completely cut

Allegations: Mickey Rooney's stepson Chris Aber claims the star, who died age 93 on Sunday, ended his days held as a 'hostage' from his wife Jan - and choked to death on his food. He lays the blame at his younger brother Mark

But her lawyer's say this is a 'blatant misstatement'.

'There is NO provision in either of the two settlement agreements ... that terminates or in any way effects (her) rights as surviving spouse,' Chamberlain's attorney, Eugemne Belous, said.

But Rooney's court-appointed conservator, Michael Augustine, who is also the executor in the will and part of his legal team, said Chamerlain's challenge is 'totally without merit'.

'She cannot resist her additional five minutes of fame,' Augustine said.

Rooney's ammended will - which was signed March 11, just over three weeks before he died - named his stepson, Mark Rooney, who lived with in the two years leading up to his death, as the sole benneficiary.

Rooney 'intentionally omitted' and disinherited his eight surviving biological children and two other stepchildren from his last marriage, the will said.

Rooney had no negative feelings toward his surviving children, but they were all financially better off than he was, Augustine said, adding that Rooney believed that what little he had to leave should go to Mark Rooney and his wife, because they had been taking good care of him in his final years.

However another of Rooney's stepsons, Christopher Aber, said the entertainer was a 'hostage' and was forcibly kept apart 
from his eighth and current wife Jan Chamberlain - and alleges the star was so badly 
treated that he died after choking on his food.

Sole beneficiary: Mark Rooney has been looking after his stepfather for the last two years and has inherited the $18,000 estate of Mickey Rooney

Aber squared the blame at his younger brother, Mark Rooney, at whose Studio City home Mickey passed away.

According to Augustine, the actor had been in good spirits and 
was looking forward to continuing to appear in movies after filming a 
scene for the upcoming installment of the Night at the Museum franchise.

Augustine said Rooney, 93, passed a 
physical exam required before he could start filming and his death was due to
 natural causes, including complications related to diabetes.

Police and coroner's officials were informed of Rooney's death but said no investigation was necessary.

Despite a show business career spanning 90 years, Rooney said he had lost most of his fortune because of 'elder abuse' and financial mismanagement by another one of his stepsons.

Augustine said despite an agreement for millions to be repaid to the actor, it was unlikely the estate could ever collect on the judgment.

Christopher Aber was accused of taking $2.8 million from his stepfather, however he vehemently denied the allegations when speaking to The Mail Online.

Final will: Mickey Rooney filed this will just 
weeks before his death aged 93 on Sunday. It makes his stepson Mark 
Rooney the sole beneficiary

Cut out: Mickey Rooney's will shows that his 
wife Jan agreed to give up claims on his estate following their 2012 
separation. This is contested by a source close to Jan and her son Chris
 Aber

Trust: In a document signed in 2003, called The 
Rooney Trust, it states the trust cannot be altered without one of the 
trustees - Mickey Rooney and his estranged wife Jan Chamberlain Rooney -
 signing off

'The sad part is 
that my mother has not been with my father for the last year, they’re 
not divorced, they’re legally married, living separately,' Aber said.

‘Mickey
 has been living apart with my brother. He was put in charge of Mickey, 
and he moved him to Studio City, they got to live freely, getting paid 
to look after him.

‘Well, he choked on his own food when he died, that’s how he died, they should have been looking after him. No-one was there to pat him on the back? I found out when I spoke to the doctors.’

Rooney's will disinherited the actor's eight surviving children, as well as his estranged wife. 

As it stands Jan Rooney will receive her 
husband's Social Security benefits and some of his pension earnings as a
 result of a previous agreement; Augustine said Rooney felt that 
provided adequate care for her.

Disinherited: Mickey Rooney's estranged wife Jan will receive her husband's Social Security benefits and some of his pension earnings as a result of a previous agreement. She is taking the matter to court

The star of the Andy Hardy films and Hollywood's highest paid actor in the late 1930s and early 1940s, Rooney was a product of the industry's old studio system and was not entitled to hefty royalty payments, Augustine said.

After family members resolved a dispute about Rooney's funeral, he was buried at Hollywood Forever Cemetery alongside other screen stars.

Rooney's conservator and Jan Chamberlain agreed to collaborate on a small funeral for family members.

Christopher and Christina Aber, whom Rooney had accused of abuse, will not be permitted to attend.
