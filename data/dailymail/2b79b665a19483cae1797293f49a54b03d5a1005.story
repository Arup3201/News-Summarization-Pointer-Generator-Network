Ireland laid down a heroic World Cup marker by producing a stunning defensive effort to keep Australia at bay in Dublin.

The Aussies fought back from 17-0 down at the Aviva Stadium to take a three-point lead just before half-time.

But Joe Schmidt’s men weren’t to be denied their first autumn Test series clean sweep since 2006 and it leaves Australia — who also lost 29-26 to France — desperate to avoid the humiliation of a hat-trick of November defeats when they round off their tour against England at Twickenham on Saturday

Ireland got off to a lightning start thanks to tries from Simon Zebo and Tommy Bowe, while Johnny Sexton booted 16 points.

Australia scrum-half Nick Phipps crossed twice, with Bernard Foley claiming a third score for the visitors, but Ireland held firm under huge final-quarter pressure.

Captain Paul O’Connell said: ‘It really is a good win. We couldn’t have had a better first 20 minutes and it was frustrating to let them back in in the next 20.

‘But they are a fast side who put you under pressure and are probably further down the road in terms of match play than we are, so the way we finished off the game was very satisfying.’

Ireland will now go into World Cup year with a spring in their step after atoning for last year’s 32-15 defeat to Australia in combative style.

It also provided some relief for coach Schmidt as it was later revealed he had been suffering from the effects of suspected appendicitis all day and had left the ground for medical tests straight after the final whistle.

On the pitch, Sexton kicked an early penalty before teeing up the game’s opening try with a precise kick which allowed Zebo to slide home.

Bowe pulled off a keen-eyed interception and galloped over for a second try but Australia clawed one back when Phipps ntercepted Zebo’s pass to hare home. Foley’s conversion cut the deficit to 10 points.

The Wallabies then scored a controversial second. Phipps’ scoring pass to Foley appeared forward, but was awarded by French television match official Eric Gauzins.

Foley missed the conversion, though Phipps crossed again to level the scores.

Foley’s penalty wrestled the visitors into the lead for the first time before Sexton tied the scores with the last kick of a breathless half.

Sexton posted his third penalty after the restart before Foley responded, and the teams were still locked at 23-23 on the hour.

Rob Kearney launched an ambitious drop-goal attempt from long range after a period of Irish pressure but his effort rebounded off the right-hand post. However, Sexton’s fourth penalty of the night did edge Ireland back into a three-point lead.

Australia duly pegged Ireland back into their half for the remaining 16 minutes but, unlike in times past, this gritty group, conquerors of South Africa and Georgia over the last two weekends, bravely held out for a famous win.
