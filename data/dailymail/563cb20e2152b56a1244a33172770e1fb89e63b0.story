Gwyneth may have given her blessing, but that hasn't stopped eyebrows being raised about ex Chris Martin's rumoured new partner - Hunger Games star, Jennifer Lawrence.

The two have reportedly been 'secretly' dating since July.

Which means 41-year-old Gwyneth must surely be threatened, right? (Really guys? Have you seen those legs?)

There's something very grounded about Jennifer that seems to gel with Chris 

And with a 13-year age gap - Jen's 24, Chris is 37 - can this really work long-term?

The naysayer's say no.

With more than a decade between them, what points of reference do Chris and Jen have? They've grown up with different music, TV, movies, what do they talk about?

Chris has two children already, won't Jen want to have hers with someone who'll experience it with her for the very first time?

What about the power dynamic?

Jen's the younger partner and in the 'pupil' position. Chris has lived longer so probably (hopefully) knows more.

Tracey says acceptance levels of age-gap relationships has never been higher

The power's automatically on his side: won't Jen view him as a teacher or parent, someone to hide things from if she's been 'naughty'?

As the older partner, won't Jen's lack of experience and wisdom be frustrating for Chris?

He's been through all the experiences she's about to and who really wants to go back for round two?

Do age-gap relationships ever really work long-term?

Well, actually, yes they can - and do!

Being around the same age is a rough predictor of having common ground but it doesn't guarantee synchron­isation.

We are all a sum of totals. Our true maturity depends very much on what we've accomplished, our personality, genetics, life experiences, expectations and morals.

There might be 13 years between Chris and Jen but, to my eye, they appear to have a lot more in common than Chris and Gwyneth ever did.

Jen might glam up for the red carpet, but off duty she's parked firmly in the no-makeup and scruffy jeans camp. One reason Gwyneth and Chris didn't work out was she loved getting glammed for the LA premieres and being seen in all the right places.

He reportedly detested it.

Gwyneth is fanatical about health and diet, Chris decided he wasn't vegetarian quick-smart post break-up.

Which is rather handy since Jen's fond of fast food and burgers.

Both women are bright and undeniably elegant (who didn't fall for Jen when she so oh-so-gracefully tripped on her way to receive an Oscar). But there's something very grounded about Jennifer that seems to gel with Chris' consistent shying away from the limelight.

In the face of all that common ground, does it really matter he's been on the planet for 13 more years?

We constantly focus on ways society is failing us but acceptance levels of age-gap relationships has never been higher.

This not only shows maturity of attitude, it's practical too!

God knows, it's hard enough finding a soulmate without having to make sure you're both matching bookends.

I like this new pairing and that Chris and Jen haven't let age get in the way.

May I suggest they relax and enjoy - and if need be, get a few tips from Calista Flockhart and Harrison Ford (22 years difference, together 12 years) and Vivienne Westwood and Andreas Kronthaler (25 years difference, together 24 years) along the way.
