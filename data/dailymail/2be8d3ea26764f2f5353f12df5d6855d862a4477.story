Wasps have announced the appointment of Lee Blackett as their new backs coach for next season.

The 32-year-old will move to the Aviva Premiership side from Championship club Rotherham, where he is currently head coach.

He will replace former Wales fly-half Stephen Jones, who is returning to the Llanelli-based Scarlets in a coaching capacity.

Wasps rugby director Dai Young said: 'We always knew the time would come when Stephen would want to return to Wales with his young family. He has done a great job for us.

'Lee is one of the brightest young coaches in Britain, who has won admiration throughout the game for how he has turned Rotherham Titans into one of the strongest teams outside of the Premiership.

'He has impressed knowledgeable onlookers by his attention to detail, enthusiasm and professionalism, and his proven ability to get the best out of the players he coaches.'Â
