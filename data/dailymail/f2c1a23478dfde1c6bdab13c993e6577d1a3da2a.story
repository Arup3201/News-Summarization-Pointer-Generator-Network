The parents of murdered Queensland teenager Daniel Morcombe have revealed their outrage at news a key police interview will be kept secret to protect the privacy of their son's killer.

Bruce and Denise Morcombe claim details from an interview Northern Territory police conducted with Brett Peter Cowan could be the key to ensuring he never secures parole.

The interview with Cowan is not in relation to Daniel Morcombe but an attack on a six-year-old boy in 1993, Channel Seven reports. But it will not be revealed after it was ruled that doing so would amount to an 'invasion of Mr Cowan's privacy'.

Cowan was in March jailed for life for the 2003 murder of 13-year-old Daniel, who he abused and killed in an abandoned house after abducting the teen from a Sunshine Coast bus stop.

'That intimate detail and certainly that vision has never been seen,' Bruce Morcombe told Seven about the secret interview.

'He's not entitled to rights, he should be exposed for the person he is.'Denise Morcombe claimed that the interview could provide key information that could ensure Cowan never leaves prison, adding: 'We don't want another child to be murdered or molested.'

It comes after the TV network published the first picture of Cowan behind bars, showing a fitter and healthier looking man inside the maximum security Wolston Correctional Centre.

It is the first time Bruce and Denise Morcombe had seen their son's killer since he was led away from Brisbane Supreme Court following his sentencing.

When he was imprisoned, he had special food requests such as Coco Pops rejected, but in his cell he has his own TV, radio, toilet and shower.

Himself a father, Cowan has three children but they won't be seeing their dad for at least 20 years when the 44-year-old is eligible for parole from his maximum security cell.

Himself a father, Cowan has three children but they won't be seeing their dad for at least 20 years when the 44-year-old is eligible for parole from his maximum security cell.

He will be kept in solitary confinement during his time inside purely for his own protection from prison inmates.

In some cases, according to prison staff, Cowan requires high level escorts when he leaves his cell to guard him down the halls during weekly visits to the doctor.

He visits a gym, a concrete room with a single sun-drenched window, which is the only time he ever gets to see life life outside.

Bruce Morcombe said he knows Cowan would be doing it tough, and quite frankly, didn't care much for his treatment behind bars.

In a message to Cowan Mr Morcombe told the father of three neither he nor his wife 'feel sorry for sorry him'

'Suck it up,' he said.

Back in March Cowan was found guilty of murder, indecent treatment of a child and interfering with a corpse.

The Morcombe family declined to be present for the sentencing, in which Supreme Court Judge Roslyn Atkinson spoke at length about Cowan's crimes.

She described his crime as 'entirely abhorrent.' 'You didn't look like a monster, you didn't look like a peadophile, you looked like an ordinary person,' she said.

'You knew if he ran away, you'd be caught. So you killed him. You killed him because you didn't want to get caught.

'Everything you did to that boy is horrific and disgraceful. I've seen no evidence in the months you've been in this court that you ever felt any remorse for what you did.

'You have tragically and pointlessly snuffed out a young life.'
