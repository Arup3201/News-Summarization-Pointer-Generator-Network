Gillian Astbury, 66, a diabetic patient at Stafford Hospital who died after slipping into a fatal diabetic coma in 2007

Just one senior nurse was in charge of 84 beds at scandal-hit Mid-Staffordshire Hospital, a court heard yesterday.

There was ‘no effective oversight’ at the NHS trust, which a major public inquiry said may have needlessly caused the death of 1,200 patients due to appalling failings in care.

Yesterday the full details of blunders made by staff in the death of one patient were laid bare in the first case regarding the hospital to come to court.

Gilian Astbury, 66, was admitted after a fall at home, and was assessed by a doctor to be diabetic, Stafford Crown Court was told.

But she was not given insulin injections after staff failed to read her medical notes and died ten days later after collapsing into a diabetic coma.

The NHS trust, which has already apologised for the ‘dreadful’ care she received and admitted health and safety breaches, now faces a possible fine of £1million.

However, campaigners say the fine will be paid out of  taxpayers’ money and simply hit patient care – and do nothing to hold managers to account.

The family of Mrs Astbury have also made it clear that they would rather see those responsible prosecuted than have resources taken from the hospital.

Emma Jones, a solicitor representing families of those who suffered at the hospital, told BBC Radio 4: ‘They [victims] want a hospital where they can be assured that safe treatment and care is being provided.

'They are not sure fining the trust will achieve that outcome – unless it can be pushed back into patient safety  and care.’

Naomi Chambers, an expert in health policy at Manchester Business School, said the trust was now a ‘hugely toxic brand’ which was struggling to recruit doctors and nurses.

She added: ‘It is absurd on the face of it for one public sector body to be fining another public sector body with no obvious benefit to the taxpayer or for patients.’

She called for a ‘swift decision’ on the dissolution of the hospital, which went into administration last April but a decision to close it has not yet been taken by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt.

In court yesterday Bernard Thorogood, prosecuting on behalf of the Health and Safety Executive, said Mrs Astbury had been let down by the ‘complete absence’ of communication between staff.

Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust has previously admitted health and safety breaches at Stafford Hospital

He said her death was ‘wholly avoidable’ and that overstretched nursing staff were ‘set up to fail’.

‘All the clinical and nursing staff were working in the context of poorly-led and poorly-run systems with no effective management oversight and control’, he said.

It emerged that there was just one senior nurse in charge of 84 beds at the time, following a cost-cutting programme by bosses.

The court heard Mrs Astbury suffered a catalogue of errors in three different wards. She was assessed on arrival in 2007 and described as a ‘brittle’ Type-1 diabetic, who needed daily injections of insulin to control her blood sugar.

However, the chart monitoring her blood glucose level was not completed for several days, a referral to a dietician was never acted on, forms were not signed by senior staff, and the ambulance crews’ record – containing key information – was never attached to Mrs Astbury’s medical notes.

The case has now been adjourned after Mr Justice Haddon-Cave, the judge sitting in the case, said it could have ‘wider implications’ and he wanted to ‘reflect on the submissions’.

'Cure the NHS' campaigners have repeatedly called for answers about the poor standards of care and lack of accountability, including demanding the resignation of NHS boss Sir David Nicholson

He will now reserve sentencing of Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust to a later date.

Mid Staffs last year pleaded guilty to breaching health and safety rules and providing ‘dreadful’ care to Mrs Astbury. It was passed to the crown court as magistrates can only impose a £20,000 fine.

To the dismay of bereaved relatives, not a single manager, doctor or nurse at the trust has been prosecuted for their part in the incident.

Two nurses, however, have been disciplined. Ann King was struck off and Jeannette Coulson was cautioned for misconduct by a professional panel in July last year.

In October, the trust finally admitted to management failures – three years after an inquest jury ruled Mrs Astbury’s death was contributed to by low staffing levels and other systemic failures. The case continues.

Mid Staffs has already apologised for the ‘dreadful’ care Mrs Astbury received in the short time she was at the hospital, during which time she was transferred between three different wards.

It has said practices have ‘improved considerably’ in the intervening years.

Mr Thorogood said the basic failings 
began right after Mrs Astbury was admitted to accident and emergency 
with a suspected fractured arm and pelvis following a fall on April 1, 
2007.

Mr Justice Haddon-Cave
 was told that an initial admission process had been carried out 
correctly, but failings in subsequent handovers meant key information 
about Mrs Astbury was not then passed on.

Described
 as a ‘brittle’ Type-1 diabetic, she needed daily injections of 
slow-acting insulin to control her blood sugar and the admitting doctor 
made a proper assessment of her condition, also setting a trigger level 
under which her blood glucose should be kept, according to Mr Thorogood.

He
 said the admitting A&E nurse who initially assessed Mrs Astbury 
properly recorded her diabetes, her need for a dietician, and also came 
up with a care plan - proving the hospital's staff should have been well
 aware of her condition.

Mr Justice Haddon-Cave adjourned the case saying it could have 'wider implications' and that he wanted to 'reflect on the submissions'

Separately, since Mrs Astbury's death two nurses have been disciplined.

Ann
 King was struck off and Jeannette Coulson was cautioned following a 
Nursing and Midwifery Council panel found them of guilty of misconduct 
in July last year.

In 
October 2013, the trust admitted failing to properly manage and organise
 hospital services including its systems for record-keeping and sharing 
patient information between staff.

The
 case was moved to the crown court for sentencing because the 
magistrates ruled their sentencing powers to issue a fine of up to 
£20,000 would not be sufficient, given the gravity of the offence.

The
 current prosecution was brought three years after an inquest jury ruled
 Mrs Astbury's death was contributed to by low staffing levels and other
 systemic failures.

The 
inquest also concluded that a failure to administer insulin to the 
66-year-old amounted to a gross failure to provide basic care.

‘However before these arrangements could be set up there needed to be a robust handover system,’ added Mr Thorogood.

She
 was transferred from A&E to the hospital's Ward 7 on April 1, but 
by the time of her death in the early hours of April 11, had been the 
victim of a catalogue of errors.

Nurses
 failed to give her daily dose of insulin on the morning of April 10, 
and she collapsed and later died in the early hours of the following 
morning.

Among the failings,
 her fluid monitoring chart was incomplete, and records about food 
intake were contradictory - one said she was eating, another contained a
 referral to the dietician, which was never acted upon.

Her
 patient number was wrongly written from one form to the next, forms 
were simply not signed by senior staff, while on admission the ambulance
 crews' record - containing key information - was never attached to Mrs 
Astbury's medical notes.

In
 one case, the orthopaedic ward where Mrs Astbury was when she died was 
using an obsolete form which had already been phased out in other wards.

A specialist report commissioned by the HSE concluded the passing on of information by nurses ‘fell significantly short’ of the required level and care provided was ‘significantly below the right standard’.

It highlighted problems in information-sharing, hand-overs and record-keeping in eight nurse shifts and up to 11 drug rounds, over the period Mrs Astbury was in hospital.

Outgoing chief executive of the NHS Sir David Nicholson

There is widespread anger at the fact that not a single official has been held to account for the failings at the Mid-Staffordshire Foundation Trust – in particular the outgoing chief executive of NHS England, Sir David Nicholson.

He was head of West Midlands Strategic Health Authority between 2005 and 2006 – the body supervising Mid Staffordshire – but failed to pick up on the horrific standards of care at the start of the scandal.

When the report into the tragedy revealed that up to 1,200 patients may have died needlessly at the trust between 2005 and 2009, Sir David insisted he was not ashamed of his record. His comments led to him being branded ‘The Man With No Shame’ by campaigners and the Press.And only one person has lost their job directly over the disaster – the former chief nurse at Stafford hospital Janice Harry, 60.

She was struck off after it was found she endangered patients.

She made harsh cuts that reduced the number of nurses to dangerous levels. She also refused to adequately staff the A&E department, ignored warnings that patients were at risk and did not provide proper food and fluids for patients in the Emergency Admission Unit.
