Liverpool host Swiss champions Basle at Anfield on Tuesday in a match that will decide their Champions League destiny.

Win and the Reds will progress to the last 16, but anything less and their European campaign will be over by the second week of December.

Here, Sportsmail looks at three reasons for Brendan Rodgers' men to be cheerful and three for them to be fearful...

THREE REASONS TO BE CHEERFUL 

OLYMPIACOS - Group stage (December 8, 2004)

The game that launched the journey to glory in Istanbul.

Steven Gerrard capped a great fightback with a stunning late goal to give Liverpool the 3-1 win needed to qualify.

Florent Sinama-Pongolle and Neil Mellor scored the others.

ROMA - Second group stage (March 19, 2002)

Liverpool were in the same position as they are now - with four points after five games.

Gerard Houllier was back in the dugout after heart surgery to see his side tear into the Italians and advance with a 2-0 win.

SAINT-ETIENNE - Quarter-final (March 16, 1977)

A forerunner for Anfield’s finest European nights.

Kevin Keegan opened the scoring, Dominique Bathenay looked to have dashed dreams of a first European Cup but then Ray Kennedy and David Fairclough put Liverpool through.

THREE REASONS TO BE FEARFUL 

BENFICA - Last 16 (March 8, 2006)

After Istanbul, a 1-0 first-leg deficit seemed a walk in the park but Benfica, helped by two disallowed goals for Liverpool, advanced thanks to clinical finishes from Simao Sabrosa and Fabrizio Miccoli.

NOTTINGHAM FOREST - First round (September 27, 1978)

Commentator Gerald Sinstadt declared ‘the party was over’ for Liverpool after Bob Paisley’s side, who had won back-to-back European Cups, were beaten 2-0 by the team that had replaced them as English champions.

AJAX - Second round (December 14, 1966)

Having been blitzed 5-1 in Amsterdam, Bill Shankly made light of the task facing Liverpool in the return leg.

A young Johan Cruyff, however, had other ideas.

He stole the show with two goals to secure a 2-2 draw at Anfield.
