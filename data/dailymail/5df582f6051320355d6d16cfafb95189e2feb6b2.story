Astronomers have witnessed a supermassive black hole attempting to eat a star by stretching it into a 'noodle shape'.

While scientists have seen black holes swallow stars before, this one is special rare because it's not going down easy.

In fact, the black hole is 'choking' on the star located three billion light years away because its enormous gravity is pulling down hard on one side of stellar body.

When a star encounters a black hole, tidal forces stretch the star into an elongated blob before tearing it apart, as seen in these images from a computer simulation 

The remarkable discovery was made using a tiny telescope at the McDonald Observatory in Texas in January 2009.

With a magnitude of -22.5, this event was as bright as the 'superluminous supernovae' - a new category of the brightest stellar explosions known.

The team nicknamed the 2009 event 'Dougie,' after a character in the cartoon South Park and thought he might be a supernova.

'When we discovered this new object, it looked similar to supernovae we had known already,' said lead author Jozsef Vinko of the University of Szeged in Hungary.

'But when we kept monitoring its light variation, we realised that this was something nobody really saw before.

The giant black hole at the center of the Milky Way may be producing mysterious particles called neutrinos, researchers believe.

If confirmed, this would be the first time that scientists have traced neutrinos back to a black hole.

Researchers say the find could help explain how cosmic rays are produced, and solve a key mystery about how the universe operates.

The evidence came from three Nasa satellites that observe in X-ray light: the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Swift gamma-ray mission, and the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR).

'Figuring out where high-energy neutrinos come from is one of the biggest problems in astrophysics today,' said Yang Bai of the University of Wisconsin in Madison, who co-authored a study about these results published in Physical Review D.

'We now have the first evidence that an astronomical source – the Milky Way's supermassive black hole – may be producing these very energetic neutrinos.'

'Finding out that it was probably a supermassive black hole eating a star was a fascinating experience.

Team member J. Craig Wheeler, leader of the supernova group at the University of Texas at Austin said: 'We got the idea that it might be a 'tidal disruption' event.'

This means that the enormous gravity of a black hole pulls on one side of the star harder than the other side, creating tides that rip the star apart.

'A star wanders near a black hole, the star's side nearer the black hole is pulled' on more than the star's far side, he said.

'These especially large tides can be strong enough that you pull the star out into a noodle' shape.

The star 'doesn't fall directly into the black hole,' Wheeler said. 'It might form a disk first. But the black hole is destined to swallow most of that material.'

Based on the characteristics of the light from Dougie, and their deductions of the star's original mass, the team has determined that Dougie started out as a Sun-like star, before being ripped apart.

Their observations of the host galaxy, coupled with Dougie's behaviour, led them to conclude that the galaxy's central black hole has the 'rather modest' mass of about a million suns, Wheeler said.

Delving into Dougie's behaviour has unexpectedly resulted in learning more about small, distant galaxies, Wheeler said, 'Who knew this little guy had a black hole?'
