A gay couple who claim they were kicked out of a cab on a busy Chicago freeway last year just for sharing a kiss are suing the taxi company that employed the driver.

Matthew McCrea and Steven White filed the lawsuit against Sun Taxi in Cook County Circuit Court, Illinois, on Monday, claiming afterwards that 'there is still discrimination' towards gay people and 'people that are against us'.

The pair already filed a complaint last year with the Illinois Department of Human Rights against the taxi company and the driver, Jama Anshur.

Anshur was fined $1,540 by the Chicago Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection and was also fired over the incident, which took place on May 30 2013.

Mr McCrea and Mr White had flown from L.A. to Chicago O’Hare International Airport and were heading back to Mr McCrea’s apartment when they jumped into the taxi.

After sharing what they say was a short kiss, Anshur became adamant they exit the cab, claiming 'you can't do this -this is public transportation'. 

When they protested, he began 'driving recklessly and swerving into traffic', reports the Chicagoist.

He ejected them on the Kennedy Expressway in the pouring rain at around midnight prompting the couple to call the police.

One-second kiss: In an interview after the incident, the couple demonstrated what the kiss was like that got them thrown out of the taxi on to a busy freeway

When officers arrived, the driver, who was waiting in a grocery store in Park Ridge, said they were 'making sex' in the back of his cab  - a claim strongly denied by Mr McCrea and Mr White. 

The couple say their kiss was a second in length and was something any heterosexual couple could do without drawing any negative repercussions.

Anshur has since claimed: 'I told them to stop, it was raining. I couldn't drive with something like that. I have to drive safely because it's raining,' ABC News reports.

Pick up: The men were collected in a taxi outside Chicago O’Hare International Airport (above -  cab pictured is from a different company and in no way associated with the incident)

In a recent interview with WGN TV, Steven White said: 'Even in states like Illinois, where gays and lesbians are protected by the law, there is still discrimination and there are people that are against us.

'So I think it's just bringing more attention to the issue.'

The pair are suing for an undisclosed amount of money. Sun Taxi company were unavailable for comment today.
