For most youngsters, a withering personal put-down by their hero on social media would be the most crushing of blows to their self-esteem. But then, not all teenagers are like Jason Cummings.

The 19-year-old Hibs striker might have expected his former Easter Road idol Leigh Griffiths to be thrilled for him after he scored a stunning double in the shock 3-1 victory over Rangers at Ibrox last month.

But instead Cummings drew fierce criticism online after boasting in a post-match interview that he had shown ‘the touch of an angel’ in the build-up to his opener against Ally McCoist’s side.

And one of the most scathing barbs came from Celtic star Griffiths, who dismissed the player as ‘a Billy big time’.

However, when asked about his idol’s negative response yesterday after scooping the SPFL young player of the month award for September, Cummings refused to be dragged into a war of words with the man whose feats he hopes to replicate in Leith - and insisted he had taken his jibe as a compliment.

‘I’m on social media and you always get good things and bad things. You just take it with a pinch of salt,’ said Cummings.

‘It’s always from outsiders, the people who are behind it are people who don’t know what they are talking about.

‘I just concentrate on what I do in here and I try and take it out onto the football pitch.

‘I wasn’t bothered about what Leigh said - I loved it! Just for Leigh to even tweet me was great.

‘I’ve always liked him as a player and looked up to him. What he did here was outstanding.

‘The fans loved him because he scored goals and that’s all I want to do. If I could do half of what he did then that would be perfect.

‘The fact he even noticed me shows I am doing the right things - and it’s better being noticed than having nothing to say.’

Cummings only made his Hibs debut last season but has quickly gained a reputation for his eccentric use of language.

The former Hearts kid, released by the Tynecastle club at 16 after suffering a knee injury, was working as a gardener just over a year ago until the Leith club took a chance on him.

And he raised eyebrows last season when he described one of his two goals against Hamilton Accies in the first-leg of their Premiership play-off by saying: ‘It was some zing, I opened a tin of beans there.’

Not even missing a penalty in the second-leg shoot-out, which helped condemn Hibs to relegation, could dent the lad’s confidence for long.

Leigh Griffith's tweet about Cummings was far from endearing, calling the Hibs man '#billybigtime'

Head coach Alan Stubbs, for his part, has confessed that he just has to shake his head at times at Cummings’ wacky one-liners.

But even though the youngster is adamant he will not change his individual off-field style, he insists that he takes his football extremely seriously.

It’s certainly the least Stubbs can expect with his team now 12 points adrift of Championship leaders Hearts following last weekend’s 1-1 draw with Raith Rovers.

Speaking ahead of this afternoon’s home encounter with Ian Murray’s Dumbarton, a match Hibernian must surely win to retain their fading promotion hopes, Cummings acknowledged the seriousness of the club’s plight and the desperate need for points if they are not to completely lose touch with Hearts and Rangers.

But he also summed up his own off-the-wall attitude to life by saying: ‘It’s a short career so you need to enjoy it when it’s happening.

Cummings was not the only Hibs man to pick up an award - Alan Stubbs won Manager of the Month

‘But I do take my football very seriously. I try to eat well and not go out and drink at the weekend, I want to do those things right. I go to the gym and all that.

‘But when it comes to after the game I like to have a laugh. We had just beaten Rangers 3-1 - you can have a laugh then.

‘During the game I don’t do that, I know you can’t muck about.

‘But when the time is right you have to have a laugh. If I didn’t enjoy football I wouldn’t play, and I want to keep enjoying it.

‘It’s all about having a good laugh, isn’t it?

‘This isn’t a dress rehearsal, it’s life. Heff (Paul Heffernan) just taught me that one! You have just got to try and enjoy life and that’s what I am doing. I’m still young so you’ve got to enjoy it.

‘The boys have a bit of banter with me. Someone just called me Angel Gabriel before I came out here.

‘But I love it. They call me everything, I get all sorts, that’s what it’s all about. It’s the job I have always wanted to do and it’s the best job in the world for me.’
