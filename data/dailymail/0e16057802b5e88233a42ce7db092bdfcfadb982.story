John Terry gave England a reminder of what they missed out on at the World Cup by looking sharp during the opening day of Chelsea's pre-season training.

On your toes: Terry was filmed at Chelsea's Cobham training ground undergoing ball work drills

Chelsea's club captain is seen being put through his paces by the Blues staff, undergoing ball work drills as he gears up for another season at Stamford Bridge.

Calls for Terry's intergration back into the England set-up were voiced after the Three Lions registered only a point during this summer's showpiece in Brazil.

The centre-back retired from international duty in September 2012 after winning 78 caps, shortly before he was found guilty by the Football Association of racially abusing QPR's Anton Ferdinand.

Despite appeals for his reinstatement Terry was omitted from Hodgson's World Cup squad, with the former Liverpool and Fulham boss choosing his club colleague Gary Cahill, Everton's Phil Jagielka and Manchester United duo Phil Jones and Chris Smalling as his four central defenders in the squad.

Having moved on from the international scene, the former England captain will be hoping for a better campaign with Chelsea than their last one where they finished empty-handed.
