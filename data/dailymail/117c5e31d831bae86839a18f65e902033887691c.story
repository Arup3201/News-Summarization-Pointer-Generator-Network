China's rise to world dominance is one of the ‘defining facts’ of our age and we must ‘like it or lump it’, David Cameron says today.

In an article that risks angering other European leaders, he will offer to be Beijing’s strongest advocate in the West - saying no country is ‘more ready’ than Britain to welcome China to the ‘top table of global affairs’.

The Prime Minister, who is leading Britain’s largest ever trade delegation to China, suggests the country is on the brink of becoming the leading global economic superpower and it is pointless to see it as a ‘threat’.

Instead he says Britain wants to ‘forge a dialogue of mutual respect and understanding’ and calls on other countries to do the same.

Starting a three-day visit to China, the Prime Minister will propose a free trade deal between the EU and China -  a suggestion which will infuriate many other European leaders.

While all are keen to boost trade with Beijing, there are fears that a full-scale free trade arrangement would lead to China flooding the West with cheap goods, often ripped off from Western manufacturers.

Writing in a Chinese magazine, Mr Cameron insists the country’s unstoppable transformation ‘is one of the defining facts of our lifetime’.

He writes: ‘Last year China became the world’s largest trading nation.

‘Next year China is set to become the world’s largest importer of goods and later this century it will become the world’s biggest economy.’

‘We should be clear that there is a genuine choice for every country over how to respond to this growing openness and success.

‘They can choose to see China’s rise as a threat or an opportunity. They can protect their markets from China or open their markets to China. They can try and shut China out – or welcome China as a partner at the top table of global affairs.

‘Britain’s answer is clear. We want to 
see China succeed. Whether it is welcoming China’s investment in our 
nuclear energy sector, or creating a western hub for the renminbi in the
City of London, we believe that the right way forward is openness, 
dialogue, trade and investment; working together for mutual benefit not 
against each other in a zero-sum game.’

New trade: The Prime Minister, pictured with the largest British trade delegation to ever visit the country, will pledge his support to opening up trade between China and the EU

China’s rise is happening at ‘100 times the scale and ten times the speed of Britain’s own urbanisation two centuries ago’, he adds.

Mr Cameron will offer the Chinese a ‘lasting friendship that can become a blueprint for future co-operation between our countries: a partnership for growth and reform that can help to deliver the Chinese dream – and long-term prosperity for Britain too’.

The Prime Minister last visited China in November 2010, but relations were plunged into the deep freeze when he met the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet, in 2012.

He has apparently since been forgiven by Beijing after making clear Britain does not support Tibetan independence, coupled with indications from Downing Street that he has no plans for a further meeting.

His gushing magazine article goes on to welcome Chinese reforms to ‘free its markets and open them up to foreign participation’.

He writes: ‘There is no greater advocate
of that economic openness than Britain and no better partner for China 
as it opens to the world.

‘Put simply, there is no country in the 
Western world more open to Chinese investment, more able to meet the 
demands of Chinese consumers, or more willing to make the case for 
economic openness in the G8, the G20 and the European Union. And there 
is no country more ready to forge a dialogue of mutual respect and 
understanding.’

Meeting: David Cameron will meet with China's Premier Li Keqiang to discuss a trade agreement between the EU and China

The Prime Minister - who is scheduled to visit Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu during his trip - will suggest that a free trade deal between the EU and China would unleash tens of billions to the European and Chinese economies.

Today, at a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing, the Prime Minister will make clear he is ready to throw his political weight behind an agreement to liberalise trade between China and the EU - the world’s largest trading bloc and China’s biggest trading partner.

Such a deal would deliver a sizeable economic prize with initial economic analysis suggesting it could be worth up to £1.8bn every year to the UK economy alone, he says.

His focus on the deal also underlines his determination to keep Britain inside a reformed EU - a position which risks angering some hardline Eurosceptic Tories.

‘Britain is uniquely placed to make the case for deepening the European Union’s trade and investment relationship with China.

‘Building on the recent launch of EU-China negotiations on investment, and on China’s continued commitment to economic reform, I now want to set a new long-term goal of an ambitious and comprehensive EU-China Free Trade Agreement. And as I have on the EU-US deal, so I will put my full political weight behind such a deal which could be worth tens of billions of dollars every year,’ he adds.

The Government has already started making the case for the deal, raising it with European partners, including at a summit in Vilnius last week, officials say.

The Government believes that a free trade deal would eliminate tariffs in 20 key sectors and would save UK exporters approx $1bn a year. The UK has significant strengths in these high tariff areas, which include vehicles, pharmaceutical, mechanical and electrical goods, and which together account for 36 per cent of UK exports to China.

Inward investment into Britain from China will get a further boost on the trip when the Chinese Ministry responsible for authorising all major overseas investments signs a landmark deal backing Chinese companies to invest in the UK, as well as supporting more investment from British companies into China. This will be the first deal of its kind between China and a European partner.

Mr Cameron is also promising to speed up the process for patents so that businesses concerned about the economic impact of intellectual property infringement in China, estimated to cost from tens of millions to several billion pounds. In 2012, 1 in 4 UK businesses were put off doing business overseas due to concerns around intellectual property theft.

The Prime Minister will today visit Jaguar Land Rover’s training academy in Beijing to mark its official opening as the firm sign sa new agreement to provide 100,000 cars to the National Sales Company in China over the next year, demonstrating the value of the UK market to British companies.

Among more than 100 business figures accompanying the PM are executives from Jaguar Land Rover, Royal Dutch Shell, GlaxoSmithKline, TalkTalk and the football Premier League, as well as many smaller companies and half a dozen Government ministers.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller will push British media and cultural exports, while Environment Secretary Owen Paterson will seek to do a series of deals in food and agriculture. Jeremy Hunt will hold talks on marketing health services to China’s government.

Although Britain is still well behind some other European nations in terms of trade with China, in the first six months of the year exports jumped 20 per cent, while inward investment has climbed to a 30-year high over the last 18 months.
