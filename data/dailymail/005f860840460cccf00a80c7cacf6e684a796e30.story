At least two Australian tourists have been seriously injured in a light plane crash in Zimbabwe.

The Cessna aircraft crashed into a paddock near Lupinyu Business Centre not long after taking off from Victoria Falls international airport on Sunday.

Two Australian tourists and their German pilot have been admitted to Victoria Falls District Hospital, Zimbabwe's The Herald newspaper says.

However, the ABC has reported that three Australians were critically injured in the crash.

Local villagers said the plane turned back to the airport around 11am after an engine failure.

‘Soon after, we heard a loud bang near our fields and we ran and we saw it hitting trees as it crashed,’ one told The Herald.

'We then attended the scene and rescued the victims.'

Another villager said the tourists seemed to have sustained serious injuries because they were bleeding profusely.

'We managed to pull them out of the wreckage before the arrival of the ambulances that later rushed them to hospital in Victoria Falls,' a villager said.

The tourists were said to be on their way to Hwange National Park en-route to Mana Pools.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed embassy staff in Harare are following up the reports and stand ready to provide consular assistance.
