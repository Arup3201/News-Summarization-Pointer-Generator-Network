Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman will undergo knee surgery on Friday, the Serie A side have announced.

Tests carried out this week revealed Strootman is suffering from Cyclops Syndrome, a condition which can cause pain and swelling and is associated with individuals who have undergone cruciate ligament surgery.

The 24-year-old Holland international underwent surgery last March to reconstruct a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and was sidelined for nine months.

A statement from Roma read: 'Yesterday [Wednesday] Kevin Strootman underwent further diagnostic procedures with professors Van Dijk and Kerkhoffs, who previously operated on him.

'The examination revealed a mass of fibrous tissue (known as Cyclops Syndrome), which it is advised should be removed.

'The player is due to undergo arthroscopic surgery in Amsterdam tomorrow [Friday], during which the ligament will also be assessed.'

Strootman, who has been limited to just six league appearances this season, is expected to be sidelined for at least a month.

Roma, coached by Rudi Garcia, are second in the standings, seven points adrift of league leaders Juventus.

The Giallorossi have reached the Coppa Italia quarter-finals and play Feyenoord in the last 32 of the Europa League next month.
