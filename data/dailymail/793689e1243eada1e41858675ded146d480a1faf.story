Another man has been sprung impersonating an army officer - possibly to get a discounted coffee - after being confronted by an actual veteran.

Christian Parmer, 21, a former U.S. Army Combat Engineer, told The Daily Mail he was at Fresno International Airport on Monday going through security when he noticed the apparent officer sitting down drinking a Starbucks.

What stood out to Parmer was the fact the man had his hat on inside - which is against protocol -and he informed a police officer who was walking by.

'I just knew he wasn't military, but I could hear him talking about being in the EOD,' Parmer said.

Sprung: This 44-year-old man was approached by a veteran at Fresno International Airport, and after some questioning admitted he was not actually an army officer

Imposter: The man's story changes numerous times, but he says the perfectly-fitting uniform belongs to his stepson and that he had nothing else to wear that day

Legitimate: Former U.S. Army Combat EngineerChristian Parmer, 21 - pictured here at his wedding with wife Sarah - said he knew immediately the man in the uniform was not an army officer and alerted airport police

Impersonating a veteran is illegal under the Stolen Valor Act.

The airport police officer asked Parmer - who served for over three years - to accompany him to speak to the man.

The two then interrogated the man, with Parmer filming the encounter and later uploading it to YouTube. 

'If you're EOD, what's the R.E. factor of C4?' Parmer asks in the video. 

'What's your MOS?'

The phony quickly folds, and admits the uniform actually belongs to his stepson.

He curiously said he didn't have anything else to wear to the airport that day to pick up his father.

'None of his story made sense, he was all over the place,' Parmer said. 

The man also admitted to having an arrest record, stemming from a domestic violence charge 'four or five years ago'. 

Parmer said the man is 44 and from California.

He was told to move along but was not further reprimanded.

'I'm glad he got caught - people can't go around acting like that,' Palmer told The Daily Mail. 

Fox News then confirmed with the Starbucks in the terminal that he had received a discount of 20 percent on his coffee.

Parmer said after serving over three years and seeing out his contract, he left the army to be with his wife, Sarah, and get a different kind of job. 

Earlier this month, a Pennsylvania man was caught a similar situation.

Sean Yetman, 30, was spotted parading around Oxford Valley Mall dressed in camouflage fatigues and wearing military honors that he couldn't possibly have been awarded. 

A YouTube video of a confrontation between him and Ryan Berk, a Purple Heart recipient, who was immediately suspicious of Yetman's mismatched uniform. 

Sean Yetman, the 'phony' army ranger who was confronted at a Pennsylvania shopping mall on Black Friday by a decorated Afghanistan vet, has previously pleased guilty to impersonating a police officer

A Bucks County Court summary shows that in May 2003 he pleaded guilty to impersonating a public servant.

Yetman has refused all offers to speak to the media since the incident, but his fiancée told Army Times that he has ‘spiraled into a deep depression’ since being exposed. 

Adrienne Lally said Yetman lost his job and has had a nervous breakdown.

‘The phone calls do not stop, and we are now hearing death threats. All of this has us concerned for our children and their safety,’ she wrote via email.

‘He is a good man with a very big heart and this backlash has spiraled him into a deep depression.’

Under the Stolen Valor Act of 2013, it is illegal for an individual to fraudulently portray him or herself as a recipient of any of several specified military decorations or medals with the intent to obtain money, property or other ‘tangible benefit.’

Yetman, who insists on the video that he is who he says he is, may have been using the uniform as a means to obtaining military discounts at the mall.
