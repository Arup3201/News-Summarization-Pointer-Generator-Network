The first private healthcare operator to run an NHS hospital trust is to pull out of the deal, claiming it is 'no longer sustainable' due to funding cuts, and unprecedented pressure on A&E services.

Circle Holdings was hailed a 'miracle cure' for the NHS when it took over hospitals in Cambridgeshire in 2012, as rates of patient happiness soared and waiting times plummeted.

At the time, experts said the system in place at Hinchingbrooke could be used in dozens of other struggling NHS trusts.

But  the operator will now pull out of the deal - a move that will cost it an extra £2m.

The private company which turned failing Hinchingbrooke Hospital (pictured) in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, into an award-winner is set to pull out of running services,  blaming soaring costs and funding cuts 

Circle Holdings said the level of cash it had pumped in to prop up Hinchingbrooke healthcare trust in Cambridgeshire was about to reach £5 million, meaning it would have the right to terminate the franchise.

It pointed to 'significant changes in the operational landscape for NHS hospitals' since the contract was first procured in 2009.

Circle said there had been unprecedented increases in A&E attendances and a lack of care places for patients awaiting discharge.

Meanwhile, funding had been cut by 10.1 per cent this financial year, it said.

The company said these conditions had 'significantly worsened in recent weeks'. 

It has already pumped £4.84 million into the trust and would be 'highly likely' to have to make further support payments that would breach the £5 million cap, it said.

It also said it was facing an imminent report from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) which it expected to be 'unbalanced'.

Circle began operating Hinchingbrooke in February 2012, the first time the management of an NHS trust had been delegated to a private company.

Hinchingbrooke, which is in Huntingdon and serves 160,000 patients, was described as a ‘financial and clinical basket case’ by then health minister Earl Howe in November 2011. 

It had run up debts of £40million while letting standards plummet.

It was among the lowest ranking trusts in the region for patient satisfaction. Waiting time in accident and emergency regularly exceeded four hours and every target for suspected cancer patients to be seen within a fortnight had been missed since June 2010.

The Royal College of Surgeons branded the 369-bed hospital ‘dysfunctional’.

Circle took over in February 2012 – the first private contract for an NHS hospital – on a ten-year deal and quickly saw results.

In an extraordinary turnaround, last May it was voted top in the country for patient care.

It topped a ranking of 46 trusts in the Midlands and East Anglia for A&E waiting times, with 98.2 per cent of patients seen within the required window. It was fifth for referrals for cancer tests.

The firm also saved millions of pounds a year by cutting out arduous paperwork and middle management.

Under the former ownership, a lengthy form had to be filled out every time a lightbulb needed changing, in a process that often took more than a week.

A key to the transformation was loosening the grip of managers and accountants. The majority of the 15 board members are now clinicians.

Doctors, nurses and admin staff were put into small groups with representatives who meet senior managers twice a month to flag up problems.

Nurses could recommend that consultants adjust the way they worked and any problems reported by patients had to be dealt with within three weeks

It warned in August that changes to funding mechanisms had left 'uncertainty over Hinchingbrooke's profitability over the next year' though it said its 'patient-centred and innovative approach should ensure the long-term sustainability of the contract'.

But it spelled the end of the venture in a statement today.

It said: 'Circle today announces that it has determined that its franchise to operate Hinchingbrooke Health Care NHS Trust is no longer sustainable under current terms.

'It has entered into discussions with the NHS Trust Development Authority (TDA) with the view to ensuring an orderly withdrawal from the current contract.'

Circle defended its running of the hospital, saying that it had been transformed since the 2012 takeover when it was described as a 'basket case' facing closure.

It said it had invested in the quality of care, in staff and facilities and won a number of awards, while meeting key measures including low mortality rates, 'excellent' patient feedback and waiting time targets.

In the first two years of the franchise, it had made financial savings well above the NHS average.

It said it had saved the taxpayer £23 million.

Circle said Hinchingbrooke was one of the first hospitals to be inspected under a new process by the CQC.

2011: Hinchingbrooke hospital was among the lowest ranking for satisfaction and was £40 million in debt.

The then health minister Earl Howe called it a ‘financial and clinical basket case’ by then health minister Earl Howe in November 2011. 

2012: Circle takes over the running of Hinchingbrooke Healthcare NHS Trust.

It said it's 'John-Lewis-style model' which empowers doctors, nurses and staff to deliver better care could 'transform services'.

2013: Circle reduced the annual £10million deficit to £3.5million in its first year, and made up the deficit with its own money 

2014: Hinchingbrooke hospital wins major health award after being voted top in the country for patient care.

Areas assessed included mortality levels, readmission rates and speed in dealing with cancer cases.

Circle says it said it had saved the taxpayer £23 million. 

2015: Circle is set to pull out of running the hospital trust, claiming it is 'no longer sustainable' due to funding cuts and pressure on its casualty department.

'We understand the CQC report will be published soon, and expect it to be both unbalanced and to disagree with many of its conclusions.

'We are not the only hospital to find their process problematic, and believe that inconsistent and conflicting regulatory regimes compound the challenge for acute hospitals in the current environment.'

Circle said that under the terms of its contract it could be required to make a final support payment of £160,000 to Hinchingbrooke, bringing the total to the capped £5 million level.

It said it was also obliged to cover the costs of up to £2 million of terminating the franchise and procuring a new operator.

Further details on discussions with the TDA would be made 'in due course' and Circle said it expected to provide an update at its trading statement next month.

Chief executive Steve Melton said: 'Like most hospitals, over the past year Hinchingbrooke saw unprecedented A&E attendances and not enough care places for healthy patients awaiting discharge.

'At the same time, our funding has been cut. 

'We also believe that inconsistent and conflicting regulatory regimes compound the challenge for acute hospitals in this environment.

'This combination of factors means we have now reluctantly concluded that, in its existing form, Circle's involvement in Hinchingbrooke is unsustainable.'

Chairman Michael Kirkwood said: 'Circle remains a committed partner of the NHS at our elective treatment centres and independent hospitals.

'Our clinician-led and employee co-owned model has a proven track record of efficiency and quality improvement, and we will continue to play a substantial role in the NHS.'
