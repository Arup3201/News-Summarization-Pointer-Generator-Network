Talk about making an entrance. The teams were out for the second half, the spectators were seated and the referees were ready to get going but there was one problem: two players were missing.

So Anfield waited patiently, expectantly and then they got what they wanted: emerging from the tunnel, wearing No 7 and No 9, came Luis Suarez and Fernando Torres, two of this stadium’s most revered former sons.

This was an afternoon for nostalgia, a chance for Liverpudlians to embrace the past and pay homage to some returning heroes and they grabbed their chance when Suarez and Torres took to the field for this All-Star Charity match, between teams captained by Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher.

Torres, who was sold to Chelsea for £50million two days after Suarez joined Liverpool in January 2011, had admitted to being unsure what kind of reception he would receive, given the circumstances in which he had left.

There was also the fact that his last touch on this ground came on April 27 last year, when he slipped the ball past the stranded Simon Mignolet to Willian. The upshot, of course, was the Brazilian scoring and Chelsea blowing a hole in Liverpool’s title challenge.

He need not have worried. His name was cheered before the game, he was hailed on to the pitch and his was the first name sung in the second half of a ‘contest’ that should see local charities benefit to the tune of more than £1m.

It wasn’t just about Torres, though. This was an opportunity for many big names from Liverpool’s past to say proper goodbyes, for men like Xabi Alonso, Pepe Reina, Suarez, Jon Arne Riise and the non-playing Dirk Kuyt to bring closure to certain chapters in their respective careers.

Alonso, for one, had waited six years for this. He could have had a reunion last October with Real Madrid in the Champions League but he had been sold to Bayern Munich two months before. Alonso found out about the emotional draw moments after completing his medical in Germany.

He, clearly, enjoyed the 30 minutes he was on the pitch, as did everyone else involved in the game, which came from an idea Gerrard had to say thank you to Liverpool as a city before he starts his new venture in Los Angeles.

Chelsea's Ivorian centre forward has scored 11 goals against Liverpool during his long career so it was no surprise to see him score at Anfield

Take John Terry and Didier Drogba. For so long these two Chelsea stalwarts have been regarded as the enemy but both were given generous receptions for helping the cause, particularly Drogba when he scored the second goal of the game for Carragher’s team on 31 minutes.

The first had been scored by Mario Balotelli and a cracker it was too, the Italian whipping a 25-yard drive that fizzed into the corner of The Kop net on nine minutes. He wasn’t put under great pressure but the finish still smacked of class.

At one stage it looked as if Carragher’s side, managed by Roy Evans, would saunter to victory but Gerrard has made comebacks a fixture of his Liverpool career and he ensured this match did not end in defeat.

He scored two penalties, one in the 36th minute after Martin Kelly had adjudged to trip Jerome Sinclair and another just after the hour when Carragher quite clearly barged Luis Suarez over. Some would say the Sportsmail columnist was lucky not to make it into Lee Probert’s book.

The icing on the cake would have been a goal for either Torres or Suarez but, despite the best efforts of the Uruguayan in particular, it never arrived. No matter. A draw was an appropriate end to a memorable day. The smiles on the faces as a lap of honour was completed confirmed that.

Afterwards Gerrard told LFC TV: 'It has been absolute brilliant, more than anything the charities have done well with a full house.

'The hairs on my neck were standing up. There were times I didn't know who to pass to. People have gone out of their way to come here.

'It has been absolutely magical. Every player who was asked to come here did, whether they had to drive for an hour or get three flights.'
