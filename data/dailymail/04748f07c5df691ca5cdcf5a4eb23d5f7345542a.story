A teenager who microwaved a stray cat to death because he thought it was ‘talking to him’ was sentenced to 22 weeks in prison today.

Jamie Blake, 19, cooked the young male black cat for three minutes in his bedsit while he was in a drug-induced psychosis.

He claimed that he argued with the cat because it had told him that his mother's former partner, now dead, had been injecting her with heroin.

Guilty: Jamie Blake was jailed after he killed a stray cat by putting it in a microwave for three minutes

After killing the cat, he later laughed and joked about its death with fellow residents at the John Room House sheltered housing unit where he lived in Thetford, Norfolk.

Prosecutor Nikki Miller said: ‘While in the community 
area, he made comments to several other residents. He laughed about the 
fact that he had put the cat in the microwave for three minutes and 
killed it.

‘After initial disbelief, other residents became convinced that this had taken place and reported him to staff.

‘The cat was later found discarded in a wheelie bin along with the defendant’s microwave.’

Staff at the unit viewed CCTV footage which showed 
him picking the cat up by the scruff of its neck and taking it into his 
room at 10.25pm on September 27.

The
 footage showed him later leaving his room with a carrier bag which 
appeared to have the cat in it and then disposing of the microwave the 
following day.

Cat hair and other ‘matter associated’ with the cat was found in the microwave.

A post mortem carried out by the Animal Health Trust near Newmarket confirmed that the cat had been microwaved to death.

Blake had befriended the cat, which he nicknamed Buddy, by letting it into his room at night and feeding it cheese and tuna.

He
 admitted causing unnecessary suffering and was also banned from keeping
 animals for life by magistrates in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.

When Blake was arrested, he told 
police that he was an animal lover and had liked the cat, but he 
admitted microwaving it until it died after having an argument with it.

Mrs Miller said: ‘He stated that the 
cat had begun talking to him and had made comments about his mother’s 
ex-partner who is now deceased had injected her with heroin.’

Blake told police: ‘I thought you little bastard, saying stuff like that about my mum.’

Sally Dale, defending, said Blake suffered from a personality disorder which was untreatable under the Mental Health Act.

At the time of the offence, he was suffering from psychosis induced by drugs.

She said: ‘It is fair to say that there have always been concerns about his mental health and problems associated with it.

‘They are exasperated by drug use and in particular his more recent usage of crack cocaine.’

Miss
 Dale said Blake had been seeking treatment for his drug use and 
deep-rooted problems since being remanded in custody at an earlier 
hearing.

She added: ‘He is 
very clear and motivated and doesn’t want to return to his use of crack 
cocaine. It is also fair to say he has responded well to the structured 
environment of a custodial sentence.

‘He is attending numeracy and literacy classes and is a model prisoner.’

Miss Dale said: ‘There is some sense coming through in what he said the cat was saying.

‘His
 mother’s partner did die early this year. He was a drug addict and his 
mother did have drug problems. I am aware that that the ex-partner was 
responsible for getting the mother back into drugs when she was with 
him.’

Presiding magistrate Susan Taylor said: ‘The offence is so serious that only a custodial sentence can be justified. The aggravating factors are that death occurred.

‘We can only imagine the suffering that poor animal had to endure. In mitigation we understand you are of limited capacity, but the act was intentional.

‘You did brag about this offence to other people and there was evidence on CCTV.’
