From algae to bee venom and human placenta, the list of bizarre ingredients added to beauty creams is a long one.

Now an anti-ageing gel based on snail slime has become the latest celebrity must-have - and is flying off the shelves as a result.

According to retailers, sales of the antioxidant gel have increased by a staggering 700 per cent in the last four weeks alone, after Ashley Roberts admitted to using it in an interview.

Slimy success: It might sound disgusting but snail mucus is said to have anti-ageing properties

Speaking to Reveal magazine, Roberts claimed that she loves Dr Organic Snail Gel because it keeps her skin 'soft and healthy'.

And Roberts isn't alone in her appreciation of the slimy substance: another star to credit the mucus with her healthy glow and perfect complexion is Katie Holmes.

The link between snail slime and benefits to skin was uncovered by chance when Chilean snail farmers noticed their skin healed quickly without scarring when they handled snails they were exporting to the French food industry.

Since the farmers' discovery, using snail slime in cosmetics has boomed, with Japan, where a live-snail-facial is a premium spa treatment which commands a £160 price tag, at the forefront of the trend.

The popular £19.99 gel contains the same slime, which is harvested by allowing the snails to crawl over specially-built glass and plastic structures.

The mucus contains proteins, glycolic acids, allantoin, hyaluronic acid and elastin intended help with regeneration and repair of snails’ membranes and shells.Trials have investigated the healing properties of snail secretion slime, with one conducted on burns victims concluding that the ingredient was 'a natural, safe and effective alternative treatment in open wound management of partial thickness burns in adults.'

'Although it might appear unusual at first, going back to source can uncover some of nature’s best and most effective solutions,' commented Lucy Pottinger, Holland & Barrett’s senior beauty buyer.

'This is particularly true in natural beauty, which has become the fastest growing category in store as customers realise that the products they put on their bodies are just as important as the foods they put in them.

'To avoid too much of an "eew factor", we have combined the natural snail gel with Aloe Vera and Lemongrass to ensure it smells and feels as good as it works.

'We have been overwhelmed by how popular this unique beauty product has become and customers have been stocking up on the product in the lead up to key party season when everyone wants to look and feel their best!'

Surprisingly, the store says that the product has proved particularly popular with younger customers, who have left enthusiastic comments about the ingredient's moisturising properties on the health retailer's website.

Rating Snail Gel five out five in an online review, one customer said 'This stuff is great! I haven't been using it for very long but the results are instant.

'Skin feels lovely and fresh, looks more even toned and the smell is very fresh. I must admit when I first came across it I felt a little squeamish, but it’s worth getting over that! I have been back and purchased two more for Christmas presents.'
