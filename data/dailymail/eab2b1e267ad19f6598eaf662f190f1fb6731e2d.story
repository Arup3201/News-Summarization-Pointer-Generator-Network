Freed from the rigours of royal protocol, Cressida Bonas was sending a not-so-subtle message to the world this week with one very revealing outfit: She’s her own woman again.

She was also making it very clear to former boyfriend Prince Harry just what he’s missing.

From the front, it seemed that Cressida had chosen an understated — even boring — black silk top for a charity gala evening.

It was only when she turned round that the truth was revealed to be something altogether more racy. For her halter-neck was completely backless, save a tiny strip of fabric at the waist.

And it not only revealed her tanned and toned back, but the ‘side boob’ view clearly showed that she was not wearing a bra. This was definitely not a look a Princess-in-waiting would have worn.

The backless top, worn with trendy palazzo pants, certainly attracted the attention of onlookers and photographers at the Arts Antiques London Gala Evening  held in aid of Children In Crisis.

Miss Bonas, 25, had been dating Prince Harry, 29, for two years before the couple split in April. But she was seen happily chatting to the Prince’s cousin, Princess Eugenie, at the Arts Antiques London Gala Evening held in aid of Children In Crisis.

While Miss Bonas enjoyed her new-found freedom, Prince Harry was across town at Leicester Square for a red-carpet event celebrating the 50th anniversary of the film Zulu.

The former royal squeeze isn’t, however, the only celebrity to appear respectably dressed from the front and naked from the back.

As our line-up of female stars shows, several other famous faces have also gone for the classy way to flaunt your assets and display the most fashionable erogenous zone — the back.
