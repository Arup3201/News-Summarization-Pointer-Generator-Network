Sinderby WI's programme secretary Elaine Fay managed to persuade North Yorkshire Police's armed response unit to hold a demonstration at their January meeting

It was a long way from Jam and Jerusalem.

Instead of crocheting, felt craft and cakes, the ladies of Sinderby Women’s Institute found themselves confronted by a full  arsenal of handguns and automatic weapons.

Not only that, there were tasers, CS gas canisters, a battering ram, a stinger device, and stun grenades for them to inspect.

The weapons were laid out by members of a crack firearms unit from North Yorkshire Police, who had been invited to attend one of the women’s monthly meetings at a small village hall.

The WI group had witnessed nothing like it in its 35-year history. One woman gasped and another was heard to exclaim ‘wow’ as the muscular Sergeant Roy Jakins – dressed in his obligatory armoured vest – gave them an insight into his life as a firearms officer.

Event organiser Elaine Fay has been attempting to spice up the group’s predictable talks and demonstrations. After three years of trying, she succeeded in getting the firearms team to come.

The force initially offered her a Neighbourhood Watch talk. Mrs Fay, 52, said: ‘I thought “how boring, we need something with a bit more oomph,” so I just contacted the firearms unit myself.’

Official clearance was given 18 months ago and finally the date was booked. The plain-speaking Yorkshirewoman told the sergeant the ladies didn’t want to be short-changed.

Her instructions were: ‘Come suited and booted. We want to see something. Don’t just stand and talk.’

The team from North Yorkshire Police's armed response unit took an array of weapons including tasers and a selection of guns (file picture)

Members of the WI were also shown items including CS gas canisters (file picture, left) and truncheons (file picture, right)

The 11-strong audience of women, 
ranging in age from their late 30s to late 60s, were allowed to handle 
the guns and equipment during the meeting, which lasted for two hours.

Mrs
 Fay, who works as a cleaner in the village pub, said: ‘We are quite a 
mouthy lot and when the sergeant said he had two sets of handcuffs, 
Louise (one of the members) shouted out “have you got some pink furry 
ones?”. It did get a bit Fifty Shades of Grey for a while!’

The
 group have previously had talks from the police dog unit and forensic 
science team. ‘The police are just so interesting,’ said Mrs Fay.

Treasurer
 Sue Curry, 68, added: ‘We only have 14 members so it was a decent 
turnout. I could hardly lift the battering ram thing. There is this 
stigma about the WI, especially in rural areas, but our meetings can be 
really quite interesting.’

But
 some things never change. The event ended with tea  and cake. And after
 letting slip it was his birthday, Sergeant Jakins was rewarded with a  
special home-baked lemon drizzle cake.

The WI described it as 'without doubt' one of the best demonstrations they had ever had. File picture shows a stinger, similar to the one shown to the group

Although Sinderby takes part in more traditional pastimes associated with Women's Institutes, Mrs Fay is keen to explore grittier territory with the group (file picture)

In the past couple of years the group has enjoyed talks by a forensics specialist, a police dog unit, alcohol addiction workers and had a talk on heroin (file picture)
