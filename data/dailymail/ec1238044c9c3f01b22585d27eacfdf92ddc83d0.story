A former employee at Lane Bryant has opened up about how working there was about more than just selling clothes.

Marianne Kirby, 35, reveals in a post on XOjane that during her three years as a salesperson at the plus-size clothing store, she encouraged women's confidence, and in turn became more confident herself.

'So many fat people lacked any experience of being treated with dignity and respect in a retail setting,' she writes. 'We encouraged their confidence. And we 
treated the customers with cheerful respect - which was also a new 
experience for a lot of the people who shopped with us.'

Ms Kirby writes that before working at Lane Bryant, she lacked body confidence and believed she 'hated [her]self too much to sell clothes'.

But at the direction of their manager, she and her fellow employees stuck to a confidence-boosting philosophy with customers, which made her feel better about herself, too.

'The concentrated messaging the instant you walked through the door was
that fat women could also be stylish and sexy, dammit,' she explains. 'If you didn't believe in the possibility of that, you were in the wrong store.'

'The message as soon as you walked through the door was that fat women could also be stylish and sexy, dammit'

During the time she was working there in the late Nineties, plus-sized clothing for every occasion was not
readily available, a fact that no doubt contributed to her customers' 
initial lack of confidence.

She explained that not being able to 
put clothes on at all - let alone trendy or stylish clothes - made 
plus-sized women even more unsure of themselves.

Consequently, Lane Bryant was a haven because 'no one had to buy 
something just because it fit,' explains Ms Kirby.

'There were lots of dresses to try on and 
if you didn't like dresses, there were other options, too.'

Life-changing: 'I don't know that I'd have gotten to where I am now without those strange and wonderful years. . . helping people realize that there is an alternative to self loathing,' the author says

Treating customers with respect and 
making them feel good about themselves proved to be not only a good 
sales technique, but it also changed Ms Kirby's perspective on herself.

She writes that her time at Lane 
Bryant taught her that everyone deserves to be treated well, no matter 
their size - including herself.

Â 'I helped people realize that there is an alternative to self loathing'

Since then, she has co-authored a book called Lessons from the Fat-o-sphere: Quit Dieting and Declare a Truce with Your Body.

While she didn't get paid all that well at Lane Bryant and it wasn't the career she ultimately stuck with, Ms Kirby says it did help her come to terms with loving the way she looks.

'I don't know that I'd have gotten to where I am now without those strange and wonderful years. . . helping people realize that there is an alternative to self loathing,' she says.
