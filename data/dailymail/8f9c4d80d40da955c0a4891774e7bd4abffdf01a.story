Police in South Wales confirmed a body found in the sea was missing 
schoolgirl Hollie McClymont

A body found in the sea off South Wales has been confirmed as a Scottish 14-year-old who went missing on a family holiday.

Hollie McClymont, from Glasgow, had not been seen since she went swimming off Barry Island last Sunday.

More than 40 specialist officers were deployed in the search for the teenager, as well as a helicopter and Coastguards.

Today a body was found in the water seven miles from the beach at Whitmore Bay where the schoolgirl was last seen.

Last night, Chief Inspector Marc Lamerton, of South Wales Police, said the body had now been formally identified.

He said: 'We can confirm that a body recovered from the sea near Fontygary in the Vale of Glamorgan has been formally identified as that of 14-year-old Hollie McClymont.

'The body was discovered by a police search team this afternoon.

'Our thoughts are with Hollie’s family at this difficult time.'

Hollie, a pupil at St Thomas Aquinas school in Glasgow, was on a week-long break visiting family in Wales, was seen getting into difficulty while swimming in the sea.

However, officers said emergency crews were not alerted to the incident until an hour after she was last seen, something Coastguards said they were 'dumbfounded by'.

Hollie had travelled to the beach resort for a three week holiday with her mother and extended family.

News of the discovery of a body in the hunt for Hollie was described as a 'nightmare scenario' today.

Steffan Wiliam, a Barry resident and 
Plaid Cymru councillor at the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: 'This is 
awful, awful news - the nightmare scenario we have all been worrying 
about.

'This is the most awful news we could have had.

'Our thoughts go out to the family at this awful time. The pain and grief they must be feeling now is terrible.'

He said that, from the location where police said the body was found, it appeared the teenager had gone outside the bay.

Scores of tributes have also been paid via social network sites such as Facebook.

One site user wrote: 'This is so sad. The summer should have been a happy time for her and her family. RIP.'

St Thomas Aquinas headteacher Andrew McSorley said: 'It was a terrible shock to learn of Hollie’s death.

'She was due to start fourth year in 
August and everyone at the school who knew her will be shocked and 
saddened by this awful news.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with the family as they deal with their devastating loss.'
