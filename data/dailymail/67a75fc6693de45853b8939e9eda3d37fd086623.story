A law firm has strongly denied it wrote the script for a racist ad using a character called Mr Wong Fong Shu and claimed hackers posted the video on its YouTube channel.

The commercial for Alabama-based McCutcheon & Hamner, P.C., appeared on the site after it was produced by Florida company Definitive Television.

But McCutcheon & Hamner say they never instructed the firm and have had nothing to do with them.

Partner Thomas McCutcheon told MailOnline: 'We pay a lot for advertising but we didn't pay for this. It really isn't what we are about and I don't appreciate this at all.

An Alabama law firm is disassociating itself from a racist commercial 
released by a Florida company that claims the attorneys provided the 
script

'In fact I'm a little bit dumbfounded by it because I don't how this [the internet] works very well, I'm a novice when it comes to computers.'

The
 ad features a white man portraying an 'Asian' caricature who complains 
about an insurance company 'messing [him] over' and that 'Confucius' led
 him to the firm's website.

Definitive Television had blamed McCutcheon & Hamner, P.C., for providing the words, RawStory.com reported.

But McCutcheon & Hamner say the company's YouTube channel had been hacked and its staff were not responsible for it.

Mr McCutcheon added that his firm had never heard of Definitive Television until it started investigating who was responsible for the ad.

The attorneys denied any connection to the commerical on the firm's Facebook page on November 25, writing: 'McCutcheon and Hamner's YouTube Channel has been hacked.

Mr Wong Fong Shu is played by Definitive Television's owner Jim DeBerry who said on Twitter: 'I'm not a racist, I'm a member of the NAACP who has black relatives'

The commercial for Alabama-based McCutcheon & Hamner, P.C., appeared on YouTube, but had nothing to do with the firm

'Our firm did not approve the latest advertising commercial. We apologize to anyone who has watched the commercial.

'Our
 IT team has been working all morning to get the commercial taken off 
YouTube and find the person who is responsible for this action. Again 
this firm sends out our sincerest apology.'

Hamner
 also released a statement to the legal affairs blog Above The Law, 
saying Definitive Television refused to honor a cease-and-desist letter.

It also says a request that Definitive owner Jim DeBerry 'disclose the party that allowed my partner and I to be portrayed in such a negative and misleading light.'

DeBerry - who plays 'Mr Wong Fong Su' in the commercial - has defended the ad on Twitter, where he has argued, 'I'm not a racist, I'm a member of the NAACP who has black relatives.'

In his own statement to Above The Law, DeBerry denies his company tampered with the firm's YouTube page, saying: 'We run a production company that creates "Cheesy B-Rate Commercials." We have never had any involvement with McCutcheon & Hamner, P.C's YouTube Account.'
