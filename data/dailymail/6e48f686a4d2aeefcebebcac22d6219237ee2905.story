Decades of illegal gold mining has turned vast swaths of Peruvian rainforest in to pocked, mercury-poisoned, desolate wastelands. 

In the south-eastern region of Madre de Dios, in the past decade alone, mining has stripped 230 square miles of forest and poisoned the rivers. 

It has left the area - a popular site for tourists and home to several tribes living in voluntary isolation - ruined and the lands scarred.

Illegal mining in the Peruvian rainforest has left much of the region looking pocked, desolate and bare

Peru is more than 60 per cent rainforest and only Brazil has a larger share of the Amazon jungle.

Deforestation accounts for about 40 percent of Peru's greenhouse gas emissions and contributes to global warming. 

Trees absorb carbon dioxide through their leaves but as there are fewer trees, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases trap the sun's heat closer to the atmosphere which leads to the gradual rise in the earth's temperature. 

The South American country has lost an average of 113,000 hectares of forest every year since 2001, when 80,000 hectares were destroyed. 

Most of the destruction is done by illegal miners from outside the region, though thousands have left in recent months because of a government crackdown. 

Illegal mining is the second highest cause of deforestation in Peru, after clear-cutting for agriculture.  

The country has vowed to halt deforestation by 2021.

Yet Peru's stewardship of its rainforest has been questioned by environmentalists, and deforestation appears to be on the rise. 

The issues were raised at the UN climate conference Peru is hosting until December 12.

An estimated 333,000 indigenous people live in the Peruvian rainforest - but their livelihoods are at stake because of the decades of illegal gold mining in the region that has destroyed much of the rainforest

The indigenous groups that occupy the Peruvian Amazon have been hit hard by the deforestation 

Peru's glaciers have lost more than one-fifth of their mass in just three decades 

Higher alpine temperatures are killing off plant and animal species in cloud forests and scientists predict Pacific fisheries will suffer - indigenous people are also dependent on glacial run-off for hydro-power 

Indigenous groups are often hard hit because they lack formal property title and are marginalised from the political and legal systems, unable to fend off encroachment on their land. 

An estimated 333,000 indigenous people live in the Peruvian Amazon and have campaigned with increasing vigour to protect areas that traditionally belong to them.

In September, four leaders from the Ashaninka people were killed while campaigning against deforestation and for land rights.
