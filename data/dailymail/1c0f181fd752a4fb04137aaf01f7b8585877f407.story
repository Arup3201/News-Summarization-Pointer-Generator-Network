Prince Harry has started his US trip for rowdy royal pal Guy Pelly's wedding as he means to go on - with an evening at two of Miami's hottest nightspots.

Although the trip was originally planned as a romantic getaway with girlfriend Cressida Bonas, the red-haired royal, 29, hit the party scene alone on Wednesday night - just days after the couple split.

Missing the funeral of Mark Shand, the brother of his step-mother, the Duchess of Cornwall, held in the UK today, the Prince and his pals dined at Hakkasan and then went on to the trendy LIV nightclub at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel.

And Prince Harry was certainly letting heartbreak get in the way of having a good time as he hit the town and was given VIP treatment in one of the club's SkyBoxes - a private booth which overlooks the scene - where a mystery brunette was seen hugging him.

The fourth in line to throne should have been accompanied by his girlfriend of two years.

But
 the couple suddenly split at the weekend with Cressida, a former 
dance student who is now working in marketing, suddenly cancelling her 
plans to travel to the US, much to the surprise of family and friends.

Sources
 close to the couple have insisted the split is amicable, although Cressida looked glum as she walked to work in London's West End yesterday.

However, her former boyfriend appeared not to have a care in the world as flew 
into Miami on Wednesday, on route to Memphis, for a night out.

The 
prince, who is accompanied by a team of tax-payer funded Scotland Yard 
bodyguards, first enjoyed a quiet dinner at the Hakkasan restaurant in 
the Fontainebleau Hotel and Resort with a group of both male and female 
friends.

The party sat in a private dining room where they stayed 
until after closing time enjoying duck salad, dim sum platter, 
Stir-fried Chilean sea bass, Bahamian lobster and cocktails.

A fellow
 diner told the Mail: ‘It seemed like a really civilised dinner, it was 
pretty low key. Harry was sat next to a tanned brunette woman and they 
were chatting away, but it was hard to tell if it was flirtatious or 
not.’

Miami Herald
 columnist Lesley Abravanel gave a tweet-by-tweet account of watching 
Prince Harry, describing the scene as 'possibly the most carefully, 
quietly orchestrated visit to Miami outside the Witness Protection 
Program'.

She said the group
 of seven 'conservatively dressed' young men and women arrived at 9.25pm
 on Wednesday night and was escorted to a private dining room. Watching 
on, she said she saw Harry 'happily chatting' to one brunette in 
particular.

Afterwards the group headed to the resort’s legendary LIV 
nightclub, where royal groom Mike Tindall held his bachelor party before his
 marriage to the Queen's granddaughter Zara Phillips.

in attendance.

And Pelly was with Harry on Wednesday night, as the pair were joined by Harry's close cohorts Tom ‘Skippy’ Inskip and Arthur Landon.

After dinner, the gang headed to LIV, and despite being fourth in line to the throne, the Prince was said to have been accompanied by just one large bodyguard.

Lesley
 claimed the DJs as the club were banned from giving the royal a 'shout 
out' for security measure, and pictures were also banned.

Harry's pal 'Skippy', a fellow red head, prides himself on being the prince’s ‘wingman’ and was with him when he famously stripped naked in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2012 as well as jumping fully clothed into a swimming pool in a nightclub in Croatia the previous year.

While Harry appeared to be enjoying himself, it seemed lessons had been learned from his notorious trip to Vegas, however, when he was photographed playing a game of ‘strip billiards’ with an unidentified blonde on a mobile phone.

This time security officers tried to stop partygoers taking photos of him on their phones and asked them to delete the images.

Harry and his group are today checking out of a Miami hotel and will travel on to Tennessee where police have been seen sweeping the £1,300-a-night Peabody Hotel in downtown Memphis.

However, Princes William and Harry are believed to be staying at a private residence.

Neither Harry or his brother Prince William attended the funeral of Mark Shand, who died last Wednesday after 
suffering a head injury in New York.

A
 devastated Duchess of Cornwall was seen being comforted by the Prince 
of Wales as they joined other family members and around 180 mourners, 
including Shand's secret lover Ruth Powys, at the funeral today at Holy 
Trinity Church in Stourpaine, Dorset.

Both William and Harry are said to be ushers at Pelly's wedding on Saturday, while the Duchess of Cambridge is staying in the UK with baby son Prince George.

Following Harry's shock split from Cressida, the Daily Mail reported the blonde is have ‘panicked’ after learning that she was to be placed next to Harry on the top table at the wedding breakfast thrown in honour  of Pelly and his bride.

According to sources close to Harry and Cressida, that led to a bust-up between the lovebirds last weekend, during which the former dance student announced she would no longer be joining Harry on the trip.

Within hours of the row, the couple were informing their shocked friends and family that their relationship was over.

The Mail reported that another reason why matters came to a head was Stowe-educated Cressida’s discovery at the 11th hour that Harry’s plans for next weekend’s celebrations include some pre-wedding ‘boys’ partying’ to which she was not invited.

Friends and family all spoke of their shock at the speed at which the situation has changed so drastically.

‘Cressie was really happy last week and looking forward to their trip to America,’ said one friend.

‘Things were very much on. Then, after the weekend she had cancelled her plans and - bang - that was it.

‘Why she was so happy one day and then so suddenly unhappy the next, no one honestly knows. It seems as if there is a bit of a stand-off between her and Harry over things at the moment, and it’s something of a mystery as to how long this will last - a week, a month, for ever?’

Another source added: ‘This really has happened very suddenly. I know for a fact that at Easter they were very much together, things were  as good between them as they  ever were.

'Cressida is young, so this could be just a blip. It’s just a real shame, though, as they made a really cool couple.’

Guy Pelly has remained a close friend of both William and Harry despite being caught up in a drugs furore surrounding Harry in January 2002.

He was forced to deny introducing the then 17-year-old Harry to cannabis, insisting he had never dealt in drugs or taken them with the prince.

According to reports, Prince Harry was introduced to the drug during a private party in Tetbury, Gloucester, by Pelly, then an agricultural student at college in Cirencester.

However, Pelly - who quit his college course as a result of the media meltdown - said: 'I have never dealt in drugs at Highgrove, at the Rattlebone Inn or anywhere else.

'have never taken drugs with Prince Harry or supplied any drugs to him.

'I have never used drugs at Highgrove or the Rattlebone Inn. I would like this categoric statement to put an end to the matter.'

Since then, he has set up a string of fashionable nightclubs in London, including Mahiki.
