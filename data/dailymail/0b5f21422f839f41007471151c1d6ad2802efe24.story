Billionaire: John McAfee arrested in Belize

The millionaire British founder of security firm McAfee has been forcefully arrested in Belize following a drugs and weapons bust at his property.

John McAfee had his house in Orange Walk, Belize City, surrounded by armed guards on Monday. McAfee says they stormed his house, killed his dog and handcuffed him in the sun for 14 hours without food or water.

The 67-year-old, who founded the popular McAfee antivirus computer software, moved from America to Belize in 2008 after a series of lawsuits that threatened to wipe out his fortune.

The eccentric entrepreneur now runs an antibiotic drug company from the tiny central American country.

He said he was arrested because he refused to donate money to a local politician.

McAfee told Belize's News 5:
 'On Monday at six o’clock, I was awakened by the sound of a bullhorn, a
 megaphone. I went outside and saw about thirty GSU in full uniform, 
fully dressed, automatic weapons, storming through the property and 
driveway.

'I went back inside, got some clothes on, I came out. I was told to put up my hands up against the wall as were eleven other people in the compound.

'It began, innocently enough, with my refusal to donate to the local political boss of the district where I lived in Orange Walk and I have given at least two million dollars in gifts to the police departments in Orange Walk, San Pedro, Belize City.'

Belize's Gang Services Unit (GSU) said 
they found a cache of weapons on McAfee's property and that he did not 
have a licence to manufacture drugs.

The GSU issued a statement which said: 'Present on the premises at the time were John McAfee, his girlfriend who is a 17-year-old Belizean minor and five security guards.

'During the search ten firearms - seven 12-gauge pump action shotguns, one 12-gauge single action shotgun, one Taurus nine-millimetre pistol and one nine-millimetre CZ pistol were found.'

Five air rifles and 270 12-gauge cartridges were also found.

McAfee was born in England and moved to America at an early age. He founded his software company in 1989 from his home in Santa Clara, California.

It has since become one of the largest software companies in the world and was bought by electronics maker Intel for £5billion in 2010, although the founder no longer had any share in it.

He lost much of his money in the financial crash, and his wealth reportedly declined from $100million (£62million) to less than $4million.

McAfee was not given any charge and says he is seeking legal advice.
