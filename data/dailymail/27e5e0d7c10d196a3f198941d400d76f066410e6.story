Mauricio Pochettino rates Danny Rose as England's best left back and believes he has overtaken Luke Shaw with his performances this season.

Pochettino gave Shaw his chance at Southampton, enabling him to gatecrash last year's World Cup squad but admits the teenager's progress has stalled since moving to Manchester United last summer.

The 19-year-old was replaced by Louis van Gaal at half-time against Arsenal on Monday and is not certain to start against Tottenham go to Old Trafford on Sunday.

'Danny has been the best English left back this season,' said Pochettino. 'I look at the stats and other players in his position. I also look at his performances, which have been great. But that's my opinion. The final decision will be Roy Hodgson's.

'The experience with Luke Shaw last season was fantastic. But now he's in another context and at another club. You have to realise that player change every year. Every year is different as thing happen in our lives.

'I am not his manager and it is difficult to speak about players at other clubs. I can only explain my experience with him. It is important to give young opportunities to young players if they have talent. We provide them with training and push them. After that it's up to the player.

'All players all need to feel confidence from the staff, players and supporters.'

Hodgson names his England squad on Thursday for games against Lithuania and Italy. Leighton Baines, his first choice left-back, is injured but 24-year-old Rose faces competition from Shaw, Kieran Gibbs, Ryan Bertrand and Aaron Creswell.

The Spurs full-back was called into the squad for games against Norway and Switzerland last year but has yet to be capped at senior level and is aware of interest from Jamaica, who he qualifies to represent through a grandfather.

Harry Kane, who seems certain to receive his first England is he avoids injury at Old Trafford, was on Friday named Barclays Premier League player of the month for February, making him the first to win the award in back-to-back months since Cristiano Ronaldo.

'Harry deserves a lot of praise,' said Pochettino. 'He works very hard in training and performs well and when strikers score goals it is good. His potential is massive and he can improve more.'
