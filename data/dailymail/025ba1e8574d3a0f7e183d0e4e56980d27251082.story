Questions were being raised tonight after a football referee mistakenly showed a red card to the wrong black player during today's Arsenal-Chelsea game.

Arsenal defender Kieran Gibbs was sent off the pitch after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain handled the ball on the goal-line during the Gunners' 6-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge.

This caught the eyes of TV pundits who questioned if referee Andre Marriner was being racist and could not tell the difference between the two young black players.

Mistaken identity: Gibbs (left) is shown a red card despite Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's handball

Admission: Oxlade-Chamberlain even approached Marriner to tell him it was he who handled the ball

The reactions on Twitter followed hard and fast, with several posting that Gibbs had been sent off for 'being black'.

Despite
 Oxlade-Chamberlain telling referee Andre Marriner several times that it
 was he who touched the ball, the referee maintained Gibbs should leave,
 ordering a penalty for Chelsea.

During
 the half-time analysis on BT Sport, former Arsenal striker Ian Wright 
says: ‘What is he[referee] saying, that they both look the same?’

Fellow pundit Steve McManaman replies: ‘Is he [Marriner] being racist?’

The
 former Liverpool winger was scathing in his assessment: ‘The collection
 of errors by the officials — I mean, it’s a shambles.’

Sports site SBNation
 also questioned the referee's decision, saying Gibbs and 
Oxlade-Chamberlain were 'pretty different looking chaps with one obvious
 similarity a veteran referee should be able to see through'.

Oxlade-Chamberlain,
 who dived on the line to get a hand to Eden Hazard's effort from eight 
yards, admitted to referee Andre Marriner that it was himself who should
 have been penalised, saying: 'Ref, it was me!'

The winger's handball was intentional but unnecessary, with the ball going wide even without the touch.

And
 despite Gibbs' protestations, the left-back decided to depart the field
 before Chelsea went 3-0 up courtesy of Hazard's penalty was converted.

Arsenal
 may not appeal the decision to 
free up Oxlade-Chamberlain for the visit of Swansea on Tuesday, but the 
FA can appeal themselves to ensure the right person is punished.

Referee Marriner reportedly admitted at half-time that it was his own mistake, not the linesman's.

This 
was Marriner's first game at Stamford Bridge since he awarded Chelsea a 
controversial late penalty for Steven Reid's challenge on Ramires in 
West Brom's 2-2 draw with the Blues in November.

It
 is a situation, however, that Pedro Pinto, the chief of press for 
Platini, said would not have happened under UEFA's policy to employ an 
extra referee on the by-line.

Not needed: The handball was intentional but not necessary, with the ball going wide

The wrong man: Oxlade-Chamberlain protests with the referee, telling him 'It was me'

Why me? Gibbs looks frustrated as he departs the pitch after being sent off

Aware: Oxlade-Chamberlain looks guilty after handling the ball on the goal-line

Pinto
 wrote on Twitter: 'What confusion at Chelsea-Arsenal with the pen 
decision. That's why over 30 European countries have endorsed 
UEFA-backed 5 officials system.

'With an additional assistant referee 
on the end line, referee would not have got that sending off wrong. 
Technology is not the answer...'

Pinto claimed that 'more eye balls' were the key to improving referee decision-making rather than technology alone.

The
 Barclays Premier League has employed goal-line technology for the first
 time this season - which would not have aided Marriner's decision at 
Chelsea because it determines whether a shot has crossed the line only.

Pinto
 added on Twitter: 'More eye balls are the answer. GLT helps with goal 
line decisions, but five officials system gives referee more angles of 
vision. It's not one vs the other.'
