From the end of Prohibition through the 1960s, New York's Stork Club was the epicenter of celebrity society.

The night club in Midtown was founded by ex-bootlegger Sherman Billingsley, who kept his famous customers happy with good service - communicating to his wait staff through a secret language of hand signals that ranged from 'No need to pay attention to these folks' to 'Bring a bottle of champagne'.

Billingsley revealed his secret code in 1944, and LIFE recently republished the set of the pictures.

Perhaps the most surprising hand signal is a simple thumbs up, which meant 'Get them out and don't let them in again'.

Secret language: LIFE recently republished Stork Club owner Sherman Billingsley's secret hand signal codes that he used in the legendary New York club. A thumbs up was not a good signal for a customer receive. It meant 'Get them out and don't let them in again'

That's a hand signal Milton Berle, Elliott Roosevelt, Humphrey Bogart and Jackie Gleason probably all saw when they visited the legendary club, as all four were eventually banned.

But most of the secret signals were good signs, and usually meant a treat for whatever customer Billingsley was chatting up that night.

If he adjusted his tie, it meant the table wouldn't be seeing a check - Billingsley was footing the bill. When he grabbed his pocket square, a server somewhere was sent to fetch a $200 bottle of perfume as a gift.

'The music in the main dining room is too loud': Some of Billingsley's hand signals were purely for the servers and not comments about the people he was talking to

Spoiler: Billingsgley often showered his customers with gifts from free rounds of drinks (hand signal left) to $200 bottles of perfume (hand signal right)

And more gifts: When he adjusted his tie, it meant he was paying the tables check. And a laid out hand on the table it meant to bring a complimentary bottle of champagne

Billingsley was notorious for his generosity, and customers often left with anything from a gold compact to cigar clippers.

Other than getting the boot, the only bad hand signals were the ones labeling customers as bores.

When he scratched his nose it meant the table he was talking to had no important people at it. And if he made a cuffing hand over his ear, he wanted a server to pretend he had a call so he could leave.

Bores: Scratching his nose meant the table he was talking to wasn't important (left) and cuffing his hand to his ear meant someone needed to pretend he had a call so he could politely excuse himself from the table (right)

But with clientele like Frank Sinatra, Grace Kelly, and Ernest Hemingway, it's hard to imagine Billingsley used those hand signals very often.

The Stork Club was torn down in 1965, and today a park sits in its place. But Billingsley's secret language of hand signals lived on even after his club's death and continues to be used in fine-dining restaurants across the nation.
