A daredevil has smashed the world record for the longest distance walked on a highline - tiptoeing a massive 1,230 feet.

The drawn-out line, which was anchored between two limestone boulders at 330 feet above the ground, beat the previous record by 230 feet.

Alexander Schulz, 23, from Germany, spent three days trying to cross the line - falling scores of times - while battling ferocious wind and rain.

Long line: The drawn-out line, which was anchored between two limestone boulders at 330 feet above the ground, beat the previous record by 230 feet

Soggy rope: The constant showers were an extra challenge for the experienced athlete, as the water made the rope heavy and soggy

Picturesque: Alex set up the line in Yangshuo, China, where towering rocks covered in jungle foliage inspired the filmmakers of science-fiction epic Avatar

The constant showers were an extra challenge for the experienced athlete, as the water made the rope heavy and soggy.

Alex and his co-workers from One Inch Dreams, a slacklining company, set up the line in Yangshuo, China, where towering rocks covered in jungle foliage inspired the filmmakers of science-fiction epic Avatar.

But the striking setting was an additional trial for the team, as much of the rock was too loose to attach the pulley systems and the face of the boulder was covered in shrubbery.

For Alex, the difficulty began when he attempted to cross the line and it took him three days before he could complete it. 

Focus: Alex said the most important thing was 'to get away from the fear of failure in order to be fully relaxed and able to react to the oscillation of the line after smaller mistakes'

Trials: But the striking setting was an additional trial for the team, as much of the rock was too loose to attach the pulley systems and the face of the boulder was covered in shrubbery

Day by day: For Alex, the difficulty began when he attempted to cross the line and it took him three days before he could complete it

Take a break: By the end, he had smashed the world record for the longest distance walked on a highline - tiptoeing a massive 1,230 feet

Relaxed: Alex poses for a photograph with his co-workers from One Inch Dreams, a slacklining company, before the world record attempt

He said: 'The most important thing was to get away from the fear of failure in order to be fully relaxed and able to react to the oscillation of the line after smaller mistakes.

'The longer I was on the line, the harder it was to keep up the concentration.

'At the last third, wind came up and started shaking the line. I had to force myself to keep on walking. Thirty metres before the end the wind was gone, but the fear of falling came up like never before.

'When I touched the rock at the end of the line, my first words were 'it's surreal, I can't believe what just happened.'
