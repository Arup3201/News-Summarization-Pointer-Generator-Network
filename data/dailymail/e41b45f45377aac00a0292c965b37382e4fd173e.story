Captured on camera by his father Moses Kahae, the touching moment shows the youngster playfully hiding his face behind his new hand.

The three-year-old was born with amniotic band syndrome which meant he was missing fingers on his right hand, left. But now the youngster can ride a bike, catch a ball and perform a series of everyday tasks, using his new Iron Man hand, inspired by his favourite superhero, right

Rayden, who lives with his family in Hawaii, was born with amniotic band syndrome, which meant he was missing some fingers on his right hand.

As he gets to grips with his new hand, Rayden is learning to ride a bike, catch a ball and perform other everyday tasks out of his reach before his new prosthetic arrived.

And he has become the envy of his classmates, all excited at their friend's new superhero-style hand. 

It is inspired by Rayden's favourite superhero, Iron Man, resembling part of the suit worn by the character in the popular films and comics.  

It is thanks to the pioneering charity, E-Nable the Future, that Rayden can now experience a whole new lease of life.

After researching the development of mechanical hands on the internet, Rayden's grandmother, Rulan, managed to get in touch with E-Nable's volunteer online community.

Made up of engineers, physical therapists and designers, the kind-hearted community use revolutionary 3D printing to build prosthetics for children around the world.

By following downloadable instructions and watching tutorials on the video sharing website, YouTube, volunteers can build their very own prosthetic limbs for around a mere $50.

Unable to afford a custom built prosthetic arm, designer, John Peterson, managed to save Rayden's parents thousands of dollars in expenses.

The hand was given to Rayden by the charity E-Nable the Future, a community who use revolutionary 3D printing to build prosthetics for children around the world

Rulan said: 'Almost daily Rayden would ask if his Iron Man hand had arrived in the mail, every box he saw us carry into the house, he immediately thought it was his Iron Man hand.

'The evening the box came in, Mom, Dad and siblings all surrounded Rayden in anticipation of him opening the box.

'When his Mom put the Iron Man hand on Rayden, he immediately closed the hand and began playing with it and staring at it.

'He held his own hand and told his parents "I can hold my own hand", then started using both of his hands to hide his face.

'He started showing off his hand to his baby brother too, you could see the excitement in his wide, bright eyes.

'Rayden's still learning to use his Iron Man hand on a daily basis, because the muscles in that arm were never really used before, it will take a little time before he'll be really comfortable with it.

'Now instead of being teased at school for not having fingers, he is stared at for his cool hand.'
