An Idaho prosecutor has apologized for arresting a nine-year-old boy who allegedly stole  a pack of chewing gum from a local grocery store.

The unidentified boy from Post Falls was detained last Tuesday at a youth detention center on petty theft charges before being released Friday after a court hearing.

On Monday Barry McHugh, prosecuting attorney in Kootenai County, admitted  his office made a 'mistake' and they should have followed a different course of action given the suspect's age.

Unusual: Barry McHugh, Prosecuting Attorney in Kootenai County, issued an arrest warrant for a nine-year-old boy who was then detained over an alleged theft of a pack of chewing gum

Although it is not uncommon to press charges in cases of theft of smaller items, such as a pack of chewing gum, it is extremely rare to issue an arrest warrant for someone so young. 

McHugh said he resorted to such measures after the boy 'failed to appear' in court for the alleged theft.

However, now he believes he should have instead sought a child protection investigation that would have led to a more informed decision.

'I have concluded that my office's request to have an arrest warrant issued was a mistake under the circumstances,' McHugh said in a statement.

'I regret this having taken place and will do everything in my power to avoid this type of mistake in the future.'

First District Court Judge Lansing Haynes authorized the warrant requested by McHugh's office after the boy twice failed to show up in court.

Surprise: Post Falls Chief of Police Scott Haug said it is the first time in his 30 years in law enforcement that he's ever seen an arrest warrant issued for someone as young as nine

Post Falls Police Chief Scott Haug said it was later discovered the child missed court because his relatives had no way of getting him to the courthouse.  

The child was taken into custody on January 6. He apparently was not handcuffed or searched on arrest.

'He was not treated like an adult, and simply given a ride to the Juvenile Detention Center,' Haug told the Coeur d'Alene Press. 

'No officer wants to do this. It's unfortunate that it got to this point.' 

Haug added that he had never seen an arrest warrant for someone so young in his 30-year career in the force.

News of the incident quickly gained widespread attention, with many commenters criticizing the lawmakers involved for being 'idiotic' and 'extreme'.

The case against the boy remains pending. Security video involving the arrest cannot be released because it involves a minor.
