An Austrian basejumper is lucky to be alive after she jumped from the top of a Spanish hotel but slammed into its side after her parachute opened the wrong way.

Maria Steinmayr, 22, cheated death on Friday after she threw herself from the roof of the 525ft Gran Hotel Bali in Benidorm.

She plunged through the air at 60mph, smashing into the building several times as her equipment malfunctioned.Â

The Austrian base jumper got into trouble within seconds of making the leap off the hotel roof

She ended up crash-landing onto a 10th floor balcony of a room whose guests had left the glass door open.

A British couple down the hall reportedly heard her banging on the door for help and let her through before calling for medical help.

Incredibly Steinmayr, the only woman taking part in the annual BASE jump Extreme World Championships, suffered only a broken nose and a few cuts and bruises.

She did, however, withdraw from the competition after the incident.
