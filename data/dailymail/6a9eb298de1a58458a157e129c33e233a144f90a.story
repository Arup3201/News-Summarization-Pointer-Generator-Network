An early wedding present came for a devoted royalist in the form of a personalised letter from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge who 'reluctantly' declined her wedding invite.

Two months ago, NovaFM producer Georgie Clark - who said she had been obsessed with the royal family since she was young - sent an invitation off to Prince William and Princess Kate asking them to attend her August 9 wedding to fiance Chris Page, 31.

Attached to the invitation was a note that read: 'We’re massive supporters of you and followed your trip around Australia. We know that airfares are expensive but we’d love to see you there anyway', Ms Clarke told Daily Mail Australia.

On Wednesday afternoon, the 32-year-old got the shock of her life when she received a letter from the royal couple, saying after 'careful consideration to the possibilities' they 'reluctantly feel they have to decline' her invitiation.

'I was so excited. I got it yesterday in the mailbox and I ran upstairs to read it,' Ms Clarke told Daily Mail Australia.

'The envelope is beautiful quality and it has a Buckingham Palace stamp on it and an ER [Elizabeth Regina] on it.'

In the letter dated July 10, Claudia Spens wrote on behalf of the Royal Highnesses, saying: 'The Duke and Duchess were extremely grateful for your kind invitation.'

'The Duke and Duchess send you their best wishes, and very much regret having to send you this necessarily disappointing reply,' Miss Spens wrote.

Ms Clark said she had been obsessed with the royal family her 'whole life'.

'I did a project in Year 2 about the royals and it kind of grew from that,' she said.

'Wills is the same age as me so we kind of grew up at the same time.

'I started following Kate when she started going out with Wills.'

Ms Clark even had a brief brush with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, during their recent visit Down Under.

'I was standing on the wharf nearby when they visited Kirribili [the Prime Minister's official residence] and I said to everyone else standing near me, "We're [Will and Kate] not in their eyeline so we’ll have to yell to get their attention", and it worked,' Ms Clark said.

'They gave us a wave.'

When NovaFM breakfast team Fitzy and Wippa got wind that Ms Clark had written to the royals, the renowned radio larrikins decided to extend invites to other celebrities from Andre Rieu to Shaggy.

'We got a reply back from Napoleon Perdis who sent a bottle of wine, and return to senders from Eric Bana and Nikki Webster,' Ms Clark said.

'I was nervous because I thought Shaggy would actually come because he's not doing much these days, but the guest list is finalised now.'

Ms Clark said the idea to send the royal couple an invite was sparked by a growing trend in the United States.

'I got the idea from bridal magazines and websites. It’s sort of a trend in the US to invite Mickey and Minnie, and you get a personalised reply back,' she said.

'I actually sent Barack and Michelle [Obama] an invite as well, but I imagine they get a lot of mail so I haven’t received a reply back.'
