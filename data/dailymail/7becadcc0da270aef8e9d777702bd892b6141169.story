No willpower? Always reaching for treats and junk food, even when you're trying to keep healthy? 

This latest product promises to help with the struggle when you are on a diet - by by sealing your treats in a time locked vault with no way of getting them out until the timer runs out. 

The Kitchen Safe is a plastic container that can be used to keep any sweets, chocolates or unhealthy snacks out of reach.

There is no override switch on the Kitchen Safe, meaning once the sweets are in, they cannot come out until the timer reaches zero

It uses a time lock which makes the container impenetrable.

There is no override switch meaning once the sweets are in, they cannot come out until the timer reaches zero.

The timer can be set to lock for between one minute to 10 days.

The safe can store food items such as cookies, and sweets, for any time from one minute up to 10 days 

The company behind the invention hopes that it will remove the temptation of eating unhealthy food for people on a diet.

David Krippendorf created the Kitchen Safe in the States along with Nick and Ryan Tseng - and it is now available in the UK.

The safe is made out of thick plastic 

Mr Krippendorf said: 'The Kitchen Safe helps people achieve their goals by limiting and avoiding temptations.

'We've had people tell us they've lost weight, quit smoking, or just maintain a more healthy diet.

'It was something that I wanted and needed for myself. I wanted to avoid the temptation that led me to nibble on food throughout the day.

'Now I have three Kitchen Safes in my home and put different items in each..

'Our customers tell us it has made a huge impact in their lives.'

The safe is made of plastic that is three times thicker than a normal plastic container to keep its content secure.

It can also be used to keep distracting items out of reach when you want to be productive.

Games console controllers, TV remote controls and mobile phones can all be kept out of reach when trying to get some work done.

The safe comes with the options of a clear, see-through base or a solid white colour which hides the contents and keeps it out of sight and out of mind.

It costs $49 (£31.73) from the company's website and is available in the UK from their UK warehouse.

The two AA batteries it uses will last for around six months.
