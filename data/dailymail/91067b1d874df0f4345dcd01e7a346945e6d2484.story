The former Legia Warsaw stopper, who joined the Gunners for £2million in 2007, spent the majority of his time in north London as Arsene Wenger's second choice keeper.

His last act as an Arsenal player was to help the club end their nine-year trophy drought by winning the FA Cup final against Hull in extra-time.

Fabianski will provide competition for Michel Vorm and Gerhard Tremmel at the Liberty Stadium.

Speaking to Swansea's official website, Fabianski said: 'I am very happy with the move, the decision and the club. I’m very excited for the coming season and the coming years.

'It will be a big honour to represent Swansea City. Everyone interested in football knows that Swansea is a proper football club. The way they play football is nice to watch and they have always been an exciting team.

'Based on what the club has achieved 
in the three previous seasons in the Premier League, you can clearly see
 that year upon year the club is moving forward.

'The club represents good values and the style of football is something that I would like to be a part of.

'I
 know quite a bit about them already, but I am sure I will get to know 
quite a bit more in the coming months. For me, it was an easy decision 
to make to join the club.

'If I'm completely honest, the main reason I came to Swansea was because I want to be the number one goalkeeper. I want to play week in, week out.

'It's going to be a real fight, but I'm not afraid of that. Competition is always good, so I think everyone will take positives from that.

'I'm excited. I've already asked for the pre-season programme to see how it looks. I'm really looking forward to starting with my new team-mates and I think it's going to be a fantastic new chapter in my life.

'I will be working hard for the club, giving everything every single day. I can promise that.'
