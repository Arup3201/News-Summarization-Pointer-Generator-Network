A naked man went crazy in the San Francisco Subway and began alternately fighting people, assaulting commuters and doing gymnastics.

The man ran amok inside the train station frightening passengers including a young woman who ended up falling over in herself in an attempt to get away.

Then the naked nuisance takes on a member of BART staff (Bay Area Rapid Transit) as he is chased around the concourse before turning his attentions to an older man who was making his way through the ticket barriers.

Scroll down for video...

Frightening: This poor woman falls over herself as she rushes to get away from the naked man

Barrier jumper: The man stands atop the turnstiles as passengers rush for the exits

Upside down: Handstands are next as the man jumps across the metal barriers. Some passengers barely stop to notice

In between there are some impressive acrobatics as the man bounced off the turnstiles and the ticket machines of the 16th Street BART station in the city's Mission District.

One passenger even kicks him in the butt as he walks his bike along the stations landing whilst another customer is wrestled by the man for no apparent reason.

Tussle: A subway worker tried to intervene as the naked man wrangles with an elderly male commuter

Terrifying: The old man is powerless to stop the naked man from jumping on top of him as he tries to leave the station

Squaring up: The subway worker tries to take on the naked man and stop his running around

Restless: Now over by the station ticket machines the man kicks his legs into the air whilst the subway worker looks on helplessly

Some passersby stopped and stared, 
others jumped in to help, but the vast majority seemed to do their best 
to ignore the unfolding situation completely.

Although the man was not carrying any weapons, it's clear from the 
screams in the video that most commuters who simply wanted to get to 
where they were going, were shocked and frightened by the experience.

On the Facebook page of local blog Mission Mission an eyewitnesses provided more details on the incident, 
which apparently started above ground where the 'naked man began 
shedding his clothes, running around screaming, and jumping on top of 
cars.'

It took a team of 
police officers to shut down the station and eventually wrestle the man 
to the ground and wheel him out on a stretcher.

After his arrest, the man was taken for a mental evaluation.

Preparing to dismount: The man treats the equipment in the subway station as if it were a gymnasium

Back to earth: The man lands on his feet as he looks for his next target

Oblivious: Many commuters simply stroll on by as the man lays face down on the station concourse

Evasive action: Another commuter panics as she wonders where best to run towards

It's not uncommon to see all kinds of weird unmentionable antics on the subways of America's major cities but all of us hope we never have to deal with it first hand.

Perhaps more worrying is despite calls for the BART Transit Police and the SFPD being placed during the course of the video, no member of law enforcement is ever seen during the entire three minute altercation.

It left plenty of time for more people to have to endure an unpleasant commute through a busy subway station.
