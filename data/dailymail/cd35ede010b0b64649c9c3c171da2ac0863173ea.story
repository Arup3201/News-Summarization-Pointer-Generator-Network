In court: Anne Lakey is accused of a string of sex offences against a teenage boy in the 1980s

An acclaimed head teacher had sex with an underage boy in his uniform as he played truant from school, a court heard yesterday.

Anne Lakey, 54, who transformed her school into one of the best in the country,  phoned the boy’s school and – referring to herself as his ‘mummy’ – said he was too ill to go, it was alleged.

Lakey, referred to as a ‘predator’ and ‘disgusting sexual monster’, is accused of grooming the boy from the age of 13 or 14 for a year-long period in the late 1980s.

The court was told she had sex with the impressionable teenager at her family home. When her husband returned unexpectedly, she made the boy hide in a cupboard.

Lakey appeared at Durham Crown Court yesterday accused of a string of ‘predatory’ sexual offences, including sex with a boy under 16.

She is accused of having sex with him while he was in  his school uniform and exposing herself to him.

The offences were said to have occurred when she was a teacher in her late 20s, but the alleged victim was not a pupil.

She denies the claims, dismissing them as ‘just a fantasy’.

She met her alleged victim, the court heard, when he was just 13 or 14 and began to exploit him, eventually seducing him while he played truant from school at her home.

Caroline Goodwin, prosecuting, said: ‘At this house, groups of boys would gather – her husband at the time was sometimes there. Sooner or later he, the complainant, began to go by himself. It was then that the relationship took on a more sinister overtone.

‘He was a teenager who was naturally curious about sex, she flattered him and paid attention to him. He was a young teenager who was being groomed by a woman who was a sexual predator.’

The court heard how Lakey asked the complainant if he would play a game of ‘dare’ with her, which resulted in her baring her breasts and allowing him to touch them.

Later she allowed the boy to sit on a step outside the bath as she washed and then stood up and walked into the bedroom, dropped her towel and asked him ‘what are you going to do then?’

Then, the court heard, she had sex with the boy, still dressed in his school uniform, and continued to have a sexual relationship with him regularly after that.

The court heard that Lakey told the boy she loved him and he would say it back. Miss Goodwin said the opportunities to have sex were ‘plentiful’ and Lakey would sometimes call the boy’s school, refer to herself as the boy’s ‘mummy’ and say that he was not coming in because of illness.

The complainant came forward in 2012 after seeing a piece of literature which said that Lakey was committed to giving young people the best chance in life.

In a letter, he called the defendant a ‘disgusting sexual monster’. Lakey, from Stanley, County  Durham, was described as an ‘inspiring leader’ by the Chief Inspector of Education after improving GCSE pass rates at her struggling school by focusing on vocational education. 

The federation where Lakey was chief executive also ran Durham Community Business College, pictured

But she was suspended from her 
position as chief executive of the Durham Federation of Schools last 
December after the allegations came to light.

She
 denies  all nine charges against her, which include two counts of 
inciting  a boy to commit an act of  gross indecency, two of gross  
indecency, and five counts of  indecent assault.

The offences are said to have happened between April 1988 and May 1989.

Lakey
 became the head teacher at Deerness Valley Comprehensive in 2001 which 
later became one of two schools to form the Durham Federation of 
Schools.

Under Lakey’s 
leadership the school boasted GCSE pass rates of 80 per cent in 2013 
against 26 per cent the year before, and it was named the country’s most
 improved secondary school last year.

Lakey,
 who was appointed to the national leaders of education, a body charged 
with transforming struggling schools, entered teaching in 1982. The 
trial continues.
