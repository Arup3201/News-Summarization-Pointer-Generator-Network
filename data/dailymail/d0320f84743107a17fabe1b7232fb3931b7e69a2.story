This defeat will hurt Louis van Gaal. History tells us that he doesn’t like conceding ground to Ronald Koeman.

It will disturb Manchester United supporters even more, though, simply because it is indicative of changed circumstances.

During the golden years, only the really big teams came to Old Trafford with victory in mind. Now, that invitation is open to any side who have the courage and nerve to take it. Sides such as Southampton.

This was the first time Southampton had beaten Manchester United at Old Trafford since a 2-0 victory in January 1988.

Chris Nicholl was the Saints boss who put one over Alex Ferguson, thanks to two goals by Colin Clarke.

It was United’s only home defeat that season but since then Southampton had lost 16 and drawn three. 

Koeman’s team didn’t win this match with a smash and grab. It was no backs-to-the-wall, hang-on-and-hope operation. Not a bit of it.

Southampton came to Manchester looking to outplay United, while Saints’ manager came to prove himself tactically more astute than the compatriot with whom he once worked fractiously at Ajax.

As the result suggests, both plans worked. The winning goal in the 69th minute, from Serbian substitute Dusan Tadic, surprised nobody, while United’s jumbled attacking formation failed to produce anything resembling a chance until Juan Mata missed a couple of opportunities late on.

Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster had to be vigilant but no more than that. He won’t be washing his gloves this week, so rarely did he have to use them.

An interesting fact — the one that dominated social-media chat at full-time — was that United ended the game without registering a shot on target. That put Wayne Rooney’s suggestion that United had ‘deserved to win’ into its proper context and was indicative of the home team’s impotence in the final third of the field.

Perhaps equally as pertinent, though, was that this was a game that ended with no late cavalry charge from United. Here at Old Trafford, United teams used to view the possibility of victory for their opponents as an affront to their pride, as an insult even.

Even on the days they did lose, they did so while threatening to kick the door down.

Not on Sunday, though. Van Gaal made late substitutions and changed things round a bit. He pushed Rooney up the middle and threw on Marouane Fellaini to try to unsettle Southampton physically.United still ended the game quietly, though. Beaten in every way.

Young striker James Wilson remained on the substitutes’ bench while Radamel Falcao — £280,000-a-week Radamel Falcao — watched from afar, having failed to make the squad.

It was all a little odd, but then maybe not that odd at all. For this is the type of thing that always looks as though it may happen to United these days.

The misery and defeatism of David Moyes’s time at United has disappeared but a vulnerability remains. Indeed, Van Gaal’s United have the same number of points that Moyes’s team did after the same number of games. Koeman was gracious afterwards but still struck a relevant theme when he mentioned the ‘difficulties’ of United’s three central defenders. He also stated that victory had not surprised him.

‘It is a good feeling,’ he said. ‘Certainly it’s better than how I felt when United beat us at Southampton.’

Defeat for United means Louis van Gaal's side drop below Southampton and go fourth in the Premier League table

37 – Louis van Gaal has the same number of points as David Moyes after 21 Premier League games

6 – Fraser Foster completed six more passes than Angel di Maria (13)

0 – the number of shots Manchester United had on target – the first time since May 2009 against Arsenal

27 – The amount of years since Southampton last won at Old Trafford 

That comment referred to United’s 2-1 win in Hampshire before Christmas. It was a victory United didn’t deserve and Southampton played as though they had vengeance in mind.

Right back Nathaniel Clyne almost scored in the first minute – exchanging passes with Graziano Pelle and shooting across goal — and although that didn’t exactly set the tone, it highlighted a mindset that served Southampton well throughout.

Van Gaal said rather tetchily later that Southampton had come for a draw and got lucky. That was quite wrong.

Koeman’s plan was to stifle the flow of United possession that stems from Michael Carrick — he man-marked him with James Ward-Prowse — and then build from there. In the first half there were some half-chances for United but no more. They did enjoy territory but looked terribly one-paced.

Angel di Maria drove one shot across goal and another wide from the edge of the penalty area. Robin van Persie, meanwhile, saw an effort blocked.

The second half, though, was more telling.

The result means United have dropped into fourth place and are only a point higher than Arsenal

Once Southampton take the lead, they often hang on. Ronald Koeman’s side have only dropped two points from leading positions this season, the best in the PL.

Southampton began brightly, and Steven Davis and Pelle were denied by interventions from Chris Smalling and Luke Shaw respectively. Pelle also headed wide from a corner before, with 21 minutes to go, United’s defence was breached.

It was Tadic’s vision that did the damage. He seemed to have his head down amid a sea of red after United had failed to clear a long pass to the edge of their own area. But somehow the Southampton man spotted Pelle unmarked to his right and squeezed the ball out to his team-mate.

One on one with David de Gea, Pelle should have scored, but even though his shot rebounded from the near post, Tadic was alert enough and calm enough to side-foot the ball back into the empty goal from 15 yards.

There was still time for United and Mata could — maybe should — have scored late on.

Twice Daley Blind provided the Spaniard with good chances but twice he failed to hit the target. Soon after, he missed again with a half volley.

In many ways, Mata sums up the current United. Talented but unreliable, only sporadically impressive.
