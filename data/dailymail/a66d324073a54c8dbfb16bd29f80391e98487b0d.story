Their photo shoots take place on industrial estates, not sun-kissed beaches.

But these models are earning up to £20,000 a week posing for e-commerce sites - and the right girl can boost sales by as much as 800 per cent.

The likes of Gemma Sanderson, Portia Okotcha, Jamie Gunns and Kirstie Bennett are yet to achieve the first-name-only recognition of Kate, Naomi and Cindy.

But their quiet success and selling power is just as mighty - with UK online shopping sales estimated to have raked in £6.5billion and 14.3 per cent of all shoes and clothing sales this year.

E-commerce model Gemma Sanderson was the first winner of Australia's Next Top Model and moved to London four years ago

Portia Okotcha says she receives a lot of 'funny and weird' messages from fans on social networking sites

The models are the face of shopping websites such as ASOS, Littlewoods and MyWardrobe.com, who have to encompass the girl-next-door look without taking a shopper's eye off the clothes, according to the Sunday Times Style magazine.

Ruth Cozens, art director of MyWardrobe.com, told the magazine: 'They have to be more perfect than editorial models. Finding the perfect online product is a constant mission for most retailers. They have to be flawless.'

One stylist told the magazine: 'If a dress doesn't sell on one girl, they will shoot it on another, and she can boost sales by as much as 800 per cent.'

Sanderson, one of the industry's top earners, won Australia's Next Top Model in 2005 and is represented in the UK by Storm, the agency that discovered Kate Moss.

She says she plans to 'set myself up for life' with her earnings.

Okotcha is one of the e-commerce models who also walks in catwalk shows and does editorial shoots for magazines, pulling in 'box office' sized fees.

She also has 4,700 
Twitter followers and 2,700 on Instagram and says she was once followed for an hour by a 
group of girls before they plucked up the courage to ask to have their 
picture taken with her.

Kirstie Bennett and Jamie Gunns are favoured by online retailer ASOS.

Bennett, one of the highest earners in the e-comm world, says her 'Barbie' nickname is down to her versatility: 'I can be festival Barbie, grunge Barbie.'

The girls working in e-commerce can command up to £3,500 a day - not quite as much as when Linda Evangelista said that she and her fellow supermodels wouldn't wake up for less than $10,000.

But they earn their impressive fees with intensive sessions in photo studios on industrial estates where they will pose for thousands of pictures in a day in up to 30 looks for online catalogues and film 'catwalk' videos wearing the outfits.

The e-comm girls don't have the fame of Kate Moss, left, and Naomi Campbell, but have tremendous earning power - pulling in up to £20,000 a week by posing for online retailers who love their girl-next-door looks
