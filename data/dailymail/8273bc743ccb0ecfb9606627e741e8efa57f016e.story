They may be able to make whole arenas of people weep with laughter, but the weigh loss success of these comedians is no joke.

In preparation for this summer's Edinburgh Festival, Men's Health challenged four of the UK's leading stand-ups to transform their bodies in just six weeks,

Richard Herring, Stephen K Amos, Milton Jones and Terry Alderton managed to shed an impressive 5st between them by changing their diets and incorporating exercise into their daily routines around shows.

Hell-bent on losing weight and training for a half marathon, Richard Herring, 47, resolved to drop 25kg, or 3st 13lb back in January, and was 40 per cent of the way there he began the six-pack challenge.

As well as live dates, Richard was writing his next show, but says exercise and deadlines are good bedfellows. 'It invigorated me, and that was helpful.' He shed 5kg or 11lb of fat and lost 3in from his waist and said the weight loss had gone down well at home: 'Last night my wife said, 'What's that hard thing? Oh, it's your ribs...'

For a man of 44, Stephen K Amos wasn't overweight, but he had the mobility of an older man, and erratic eating habits. The challenge helped him rediscover his appetite and while Stephen's weight didn't change, he saw his body fat plummet by 6 per cent, and went from being able to do four press-ups to 25.

'I've already been mistaken for a boxer,' he says (we think he's joking).

He also quit beer. 'Shane [his trainer] suggested spirits and soda; although, ordering a pint of vodka soda is neither funny nor clever. I find you get asked to leave.'

Milton Jones, 50, wasn't in bad shape, running often and playing football when he could, but he was carrying more fat than he wanted.

Through the programme of regular exercise and small changes in his diet he managed to lose 11lb

The training fed into his schedule, giving him the energy to manage writing, live shows and TV. He said: 'I've usually got so many things buzzing around in my head, but after a good session, you sleep better.'

As well as being a Perrier-nominated stand-up, 43-year-old Terry Alderton's career has seen him play a lead role in EastEnders and in goal for Southend United.

That adaptability stood him in good stead: 'I always thought I built fitness on stage or with 'urban athletics', i.e. running up the escalator.'

Full-body resistance workouts plus cutting out gluten helped Terry carve out a V-shape and by the end of the challenge, his EastEnders wardrobe no longer fitted.

Men's Health Editor Toby Wiseman says, 'Six weeks might not seem long to get into shape but each one of our comedians has achieved incredible physical results by combining Men's Health science with good honest fun.

'We're sure that their fans will be able to see the results at their next show.'
