Boris Johnson wants to take charge of London's courts and prosecutors in a major seizure of powers by the Mayor.

As London Mayor, Mr Johnson is already responsible for policing, transport and housing in the capital but wants to wrestle more controls from ministers in Whitehall.

The idea emerged as he continues his tour of the Far East, reaching the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur today.

Mr Johnson will remain as London Mayor until 2016, but is also standing to become an MP in next year's general election.

The plan to seize control of justice in London would create a New York-style system with the mayor overseeing the entire process from initial arrest to charging and sentencing.

The Mayor already holds the Metropolitan police to account, and is able to hire and fire the chief constable.

Stephen Greenhalgh, Mr Johnson's deputy mayor for policing, told The Guardian: 'The criminal justice system should be held to account as the Met is in London, otherwise these are unaccountable agencies not answering to the people of London.'

Savings could be found by having the police, courts and prosecutors 'in the same buildings, working off the same IT systems, with the same priorities,' he said.

'It is a 19th-century construct with 19th-century technology which needs to move into the 21st century.'

The idea is also being studied by Labour, with the party's police and crime commissioner in Manchester, Tony Lloyd, backing the idea.

'It makes sense to explore the possibility of bringing local Crown Prosecution Service and court services under the oversight of police and crime commissioners, establishing transparency and public accountability throughout the entire criminal justice system,' he said.

Mr Johnson has previously called for the Mayor to have overall control of schools in London, which is currently held by the capital's boroughs.

Today Mr Johnson is to meet the prime minister of Malaysia and the mayor of Kuala Lumpur as he reaches the third country of a high-profile regional tour.

He has been repeatedly mobbed by members of the public on his trip, which will continue for the next two days.

Ahead of events in Malaysia, Mr Johnson said: 'This fast-developing nation is teaming with new and exciting trade and investment opportunities. From great new feats of transport engineering to cutting-edge design and architectural projects, I urge more British companies to get involved.'

As well as senior politicians, Mr Johnson's engagements will involve the unveiling of the architect of the planned Malaysia Square at Battersea. The square will be the 'public realm centrepiece' of the major regeneration project under way at the Thames landmark.

The announcement will be made with prime minister Mohammad Najib Abdul Razak.

He is also due to meet Tony Fernandes, owner of Queen Park Rangers and Caterham Cars, at Epsom College's Kuala Lumpur campus.
