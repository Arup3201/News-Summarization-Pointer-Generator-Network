Traditional GIFs are so last year. 2015 is the year of the Yoyo.

A Turkish developer has built a tool that lets users fast-forward and rewind GIFs, and embed the resulting 'Yoyos' onto websites and blogs.

Yoyos can also be tweeted and shared to Facebook and the tool works with any GIF URL including Tumblr posts and Vines.

YoYo was created by a team of developers from Istanbul. The web-based tool lets users fast-forward and rewind GIFs taken from the web. It works with GIF URLs from Tumblr, Vine, Twitter and Imgur. To control a YoYo, hover the mouse cursor over the image and move it from left to right

The tool was created by a team of developers from Istanbul.

‘Yoyo is basically a tool that gives the control of your GIFs to you’ explained the site.

‘Instead of letting them play on their own, you can now interfere with the course of your GIFs.’

Users see a collection of Yoyos from the site’s news feed, or can follow other users by creating an account.
