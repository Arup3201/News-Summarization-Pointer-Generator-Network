Coffee and sandwich chain Pret A Manger has withdrawn its 'Virgin Mary' brand of crisps after a flurry of religious complaints.

The coffee-shop made the costly decision to pull the brand after campaigners on the Protect the Pope website pointed out the offensive crisps branding to its members.

Responding to the complaints, the religious website says Pret a Manger has 'apologised for any unintentional offence they have caused and have indicted that they will give any unsold crisps to the homeless'.

Apology: The sandwich chain withdrew the Virgin Mary crisps from the market within a week of launching them as they caused offence to some

Posting on the website, Deacon Nick Donnelly, says: 'Clive Schlee (Pret CEO) has admitted to a reader of Protect the Pope that taking this brand of crisps off their shelves will cost them quite a bit of money but "good businesses listen and react quickly".

Mr Donnelly includes grabs of two Tweets from Pret, that confirm the company is has decided to remove the crisps from the market with immediate effect.

The first Tweet say: 'We're sorry the name offended you. It wasn't our intention. Our CEO has decided to remove them with effect from today.'

The second, one minute later, adds: 'We'll donate the unsold crisps to homeless charities. Thanks for tweeting. We do listen and we've tried to react quickly.'

Keith Beech, a spokesman for Pret, confirmed to the mailonline that CEO Clive Schlee spoke with an organiser of the the Catholic charity group, apologised for any offence, and agreed to withdraw the brand of spicy tomato crisps.

Although he could not put a figure on the number of complaints received, Mr Beech said the launch and subsequent withdrawal of the brand happened all within a week.

'The decision was made Friday morning as it became clear the crisps weren't popular,' he said.

'They were launched last week, so it was within a week of launch,' he added. He said the brand was only launched in London.

News of Pret's reaction comes as the company faces accusations of a regime of 'enforced happiness' of for staff at the chain. Mystery shoppers check for moodiness, which is said to be discouraged at the chain.

The Catholic website goes on to post a number of replies received from Pret following the anti-Virgin Mary brand of crisps.

A message from Pret CEO Clive Schlee to a reader of Protect the Pope says: 'You will be glad to hear I have taken your advice. We have now had a lot of calls and emails from our customers and we have decided to stop selling the crisps with effect from today.

'This is costing us quite a bit of money but good businesses listen and react quickly. We will be giving the unsold crisps to charity.’

One Protect the Pope member, named Mel, says: 'I just got a voice message of the CEO Clive Schlee saying they are removing the Virgin Mary after listening to customers, I rang him earlier after reading the comments on here. If Clive keeps his words, then indeed this is a victory for the Church Militant. All thanks and praise to Jesus.'

Pret CEO Clive Schlee took the decision himself to pull the Virgin Mary brand from the shelves, to avoid further complaints of offence

The catholic website was set up in the run up to Pope Benedict’s state visit to the UK in September 2010 'as a direct response to the unprecedented level of hostility, ridicule and ill-will from certain public figures, sections of the press and blogs against the Holy Father and the Catholic Church,' it says on the site.

In response to the Pret reaction, its comment reads: 'Clive Schlee and Pret A Manger deserve our unreserved thanks for listening to our concerns as Catholics and for acting so quickly to remove the brand of crisps.

'It seems fitting that Pret A Manger are planning to give any unsold crisps to the homeless.

'Thanks also to the readers of Protect the Pope for contacting Pret A Manger to express their concerns. God bless you all for your passion and desire to stand up for our Catholic faith.  

'I’d like to express my special thanks to the reader of Protect the Pope who first brought this news to our attention, but wants to remain anonymous.'

The comment goes on to question what this incident says about how they defend their faith in the future.

'We’ve been passive for too long in the face of mockery of our faith and discrimination against us as Catholics. We can change things!'

The announcement on the Protect the Pope website has ignited an online debate on the issue, particularly about whether the crisps should have caused offence.

One supporter, named Alan G says: 'I am glad that the Pret company has taken on board the feelings of Christians and reacted accordingly.'

Meanwhile, another contributor, named timmyconspiracy, says: 'Sterling work guys. Jesus sandals next please, we can’t have our imaginary friends too closely associated with 70s fashion or people might think we’re out of touch with the zeitgeist.'
