The troubled High Speed Rail project has hit the buffers again after it emerged the man in charge of championing it has been forced to take three weeks off work with a bad leg.

As David Cameron ordered a 'fightback' to rescue the £42billion scheme from a growing opposition, its chairman Douglas Oakervee has torn a calf muscle and will be absent from work as the first legislation is introduced to Parliament.

The revelation added to the mounting sense of chaos around the project as it enters a critical stage.

Fast route: The scheme plans to use 225mph trains to link London with Birmingham and other major northern cities

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin
will today launch a fresh defence of the HS2 project,
highlighting a report claiming that it will boost the UK economy by 
£15billion.

In his bid to 
keep the flagship policy alive, he will say it
is as vital as a ‘heart bypass’ for the clogged arteries of Britain’s 
overcrowded railways.

In a 
combative speech, the he will highlight new 
analysis by top City accountants showing that the true benefits of the 
Y-shaped HS2 line linking the capital to the Midlands and the North 
could boost the UK economy by £15billion a year – with regions gaining 
‘at least double’ the benefit of London.

The
accountants say it provides ‘hard evidence’ that HS2 will pay for 
itself within a few years putting the Government’s case ‘beyond 
reasonable doubt.’ 

Staunch supporter: Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin will defend the Government's controversial HS2 rail scheme in a speech today

Ministers say the previous Whitehall cost-benefit analysis failed to take account of the full benefits to the regions which the new KPMG study has addressed.

But the Taxpayers’ Alliance said the minster was simply getting sharp accountants to dress up the figures in a ‘propaganda exercise’ based on ‘dodgy assumptions in the Government’s own business case’  to protect an expensive and unnecessary  ‘white elephant’.

Mr Oakervee as previously warned that it would be 'catastrophic' for the country if the project did not go ahead.

But according to The Independent, there was already concern that he was not doing enough to publicly support it.

The news that his leg injury will mean he is away from work for three months will only add to the sense of a lack of leadership.

'Captain Invisible gets even more time hiding in his garden,' one industry source told the newspaper, referring to a nickname given to Mr Oakervee by his critics.

Today’s speech by Mr McLoughlin marks the official start of a Government ‘fightback’ against detractors including residents blighted by the line, MPs, taxpayer and protest groups, who say it’s a waste of money.

Controversy has dogged the 351 mile scheme which is planned to run through leafy Tory heartlands in Warwickshire and Buckinghamshire using 225mph trains to link London to Birmingham and beyond to Manchester and Leeds.

On
Monday a damning report by the powerful Commons’ Public Accounts 
Committee said ministers had failed to make a ‘value for money’ case for
the scheme whose costs were ‘spiralling’.

The
spending watchdog said the Government’s case was based on ‘fragile 
numbers, out-of-date data and assumptions which do not reflect real 
life’. And it feared it would simply ‘suck’ more money into London 
rather than benefit the regions.

But in his keynote speech today, Mr McLoughlin will argue that only a new high speed rail line will reduce worsening overcrowding on the railways and that the alternative of an upgrade to the already stretched West Coast Main Line would be like ‘trying to run the M1 up the Old Kent Road’.

He will hail HS2 as ‘our chance to level the playing field between North and South’.

Highlighting new research published by City accountants KPMG on the economic benefits of the scheme, he will say: ‘High Speed Two will make Liverpool stronger. Manchester stronger. Leeds stronger.

'Britain stronger - a £15 billion annual boost to the economy - with the north and midlands gaining at least double the benefit of the South.’

KPMG accountants calculate that the boost to Birmingham's economy will be equivalent to between 2.1 per cent to 4.2 per cent of the city region's economic output (Gross domestic product or GDP).

Anger: The scheme has attracted much opposition particularly in the rural areas that the line will run through

There will be between 0.8 per cent and 1.7 per cent benefit to Manchester, 1.6 per cent for Leeds and 0.5 per cent for Greater London.

The Exchequer could also benefit from £5billion a year in extra tax receipts as a result of the boost to the economy, says the KPMG report.

It adds that the vexed debate about the ‘lap-top’ effect on the value of time saved on rail journeys is ‘a red herring’.

Passionate: David Cameron has expressed his full support for the scheme in the face of an 'unholy alliance' of opposition

Mr McLoughlin has already admitted that the Government ‘got it wrong’ when making speed and faster journey times the biggest selling-point for HS2, and should have concentrated on benefits.

To critics who complain of a spiralling budget he will hit-back:’Let me spell it out. The budget for HS2 is £42.6 billion. Not £70 billion. Not £80 billion. Not the scare stories from opponents. But £42.6 billion.

'And that is an upper limit with a £14.4billion contingency in reserve which we are determined to bear down on.’

He believes the report provides the ‘hard evidence’ needed to convince sceptics.

Richard Threlfall, KPMG's head for infrastructure, building and construction said his firm's analysis ‘shows beyond reasonable doubt that HS2 brings net benefits to the country of many times the scheme's cost’.

He added: 'The UK will be £15 billion a year better off with HS2, recovering the cost of the scheme within just a few years.'

But Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said it was ‘an expensive propaganda exercise’ adding: ‘The Government has squandered taxpayers’ money on a cynical attempt to win over the many, many people who think this white elephant is the wrong way to spend tens of billions of pounds of their money.’

Prime Minister David Cameron has expressed ‘passionate’ support for HS2 in the face of an ‘unholy alliance’ of sceptics.

Vocal: Alistair Darling, left, has spoken out against HS2 despite first approving it as Chancellor, while Labour shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle has said the Government must redouble its efforts to make HS2 a reality

High profile critics have included Labour's Alistair Darling who first approved it as chancellor, and the Institute of Directors which dismissed it as ‘a grand folly’.

But Labour has given conditional support to HS2 providing costs are capped.

Shadow transport Secretary Maria Eagle said: ‘The Government must now redouble their efforts to make the new north-south rail line a reality and ensure it remains on budget and on track.’
