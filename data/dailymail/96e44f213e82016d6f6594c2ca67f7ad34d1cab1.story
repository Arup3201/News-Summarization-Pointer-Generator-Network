Sam Opolli, known by the graffiti tag name 'Tame', died from fall while spray painting industrial building. The tragedy happened in Digbeth, Birmingham, at the weekend

A young graffiti artist plunged to his death from a three-storey high building while spray painting it.

Sam Opolli, 16, died after the fall at an industrial unit in Digbeth, Birmingham, at the weekend. He was found in the early hours of Sunday by a passer by.

Emergency services arrived at the scene at 12.40am last Saturday, but he died at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital with his 
family at his bedside.

His father, pub manager John, 40, had
sent out a desperate plea on Facebook as his teenage son lay dying in 
hospital for his brother to get to the hospital and see him one last 
time.

'For anyone that can PLEASE get hold of Daniel and get him to QE A&E, his brother is dying,' he wrote.

Pub manager John, 40, then took to Twitter and revealed his son’s death in a series of moving Tweets.

He wrote: 'Sam was found by a passer-by, he’s not expected to make it.'

In a later heartwarming post, he 
wrote: 'Thank you all for your warmth and love, my beautiful son Samuel 
Opolli will be taking his leave from us all very soon. I will always 
love you Sam.'

Sam worked in a pub and was known by the graffiti tag name ‘Tame’.

Several
tributes have been posted online in memory of the teenager. His tags 
have also been daubed in graffiti tributes reading ‘rest in peace bro’.

A local graffiti and tattoo artist said on Facebook that Sam died ‘doing what he enjoyed doing.’

And his aunt, Nicola Opolli, wrote: 
'You are an amazing lad and I am proud to be your auntie. I love you kid
and will miss you so much.'

Family friend Freda Kendall posted online: 'We know you will never read this Sam.

'We hope you are in a better place sweetie, a big bright star watching over everyone of your family and friends.

'There
is so much love out there for you hope you realised that. You were a 
pleasure to have stay at our house, you were always so polite and 
smiling.
