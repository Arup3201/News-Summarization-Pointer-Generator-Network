Former Liverpool legend Dietmar Hamann has blasted Mario Balotelli for swapping shirts with Real Madrid's Pepe at half-time at Anfield.

Speaking on Irish television as a pundit, Hamann was furious with Balotelli's half-time antics and felt Rodgers would have been angered by the £16m signing's behaviour.

Balotelli was taken off after another ineffectual first 45 minutes with Rodgers describing his substitution as 'tactical'.

'I think he would have angered Brendan Rodgers when he came into the dressing room and he (Rodgers) wearing a Real Madrid shirt,' said Hamann. 

'It may have had some impact, I could imagine that it angered Rodgers…I think he had every reason to take him anyway,

'I don't think he's ever played with Pepe. If it's 0-0, if it's 1-1… I would never do it, but if it's 1-1, I don't mind but if you're getting beat 3-0…you've lost the game, the fans have come with high expectations and he swaps shirts and all also he does it for the fans to see. 

'I think he did it on purpose. I think it was kind of pre-meditated. He doesn't care.'

When pressed by host Darragh Maloney whether the Italian striker did it to wind up the Liverpool supporters, the German was in no doubt about Balotelli's intentions.

'I wouldn't be surprised, wouldn't be surprised at all,' Hamann stated emphatically.
