A Gumball 3000 event descended in chaos when two sports cars were involved in separate road crashes.

More than 1,500 car fans travelled to the Trafford Centre in Manchester to watch young drivers showing off in their high performance vehicles at the Gumball Get Together.

A number of drivers were filmed and photographed driving recklessly on the public roads, performing tyre burnouts and powerslides.

And two motorists were left red-faced when they lost control of their high performance cars and crashed.

A Jaguar XFR crashed into a hedge after the driver lost control of the back end of the car and a Mercedes C63 AMG hit a signpost.

More footage showed the motorists, in various cars, driving at what appear to be high speed through the car parks.

Nobody was injured in the crashes, which happened on Sunday afternoon, but the drivers were criticised for their behaviour.

One witness, who did not want to be named, said: 'I love Gumball events and they are very professional but with any big event there will be a downside with people driving recklessly.

'The driving was erratic and I think a lot of the people were doing it to please the crowds as there was such a big turnout.

'It got a bit out of hand during the course of the day. It didn't help that the crowds were encouraging people to drive like this.'

Dozens of car fans surrounded the Jaguar after it crashed during the event on Sunday

The pre-arranged event was organised by Gumball 3000 with approval from the owner of the car park. 

No arrests were made and the police are not investigating any of the incidents.

A spokesman for Gumball 3000 said: 'It was a Gumball Get Together which we do once a month and there were around 1,500 people at the event.

'We tell people not to drive recklessly. The people involved in the crashes were nothing to do with Gumball.'
