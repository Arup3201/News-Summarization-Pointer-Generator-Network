They may be just a few months old, and some barely that, but these babies are already starring in some of the most loved stories of our time.

The little stars all appear in recreations of famous scenes from classics voted into the top ten of family favourites ahead of National Storytelling Week.

As well as winner Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, modern classics such as Harry Potter rub some very chubby shoulders with Alice in Wonderland and Winnie the Pooh.

He's got the Golden Ticket: Lucas, 26 weeks, gets his teeth into his latest role as he recreates Charlie and the Chocolate Factory

Kissing frogs: Baby Georgia, 16 weeks, puckers up as the princess in classic children's tale The Frog Prince

I don't think we're in the crib anymore: Annie, 10 weeks, holds on tight to a cuddly Toto on the Yellow Brick Road in the toddler version of The Wizard of Oz

The babies, some as young as 
four-weeks-old, can be seen kissing frogs, napping on Aslan's back or looking 
longingly at a pair of ruby slippers.

In another, six-month-old Lucas enters the wondrous world of Willy Wonka, while 20-week-old Fergus dons scar, wand and Gryffindor scarf for his role as Harry Potter.

The
 tale of Charlie Bucket's tour around Willy Wonka's awe-inspiring 
chocolate factory claimed top prize in a poll of 2,000 families.

Nearly
 one third voted the Roald Dahl classic as containing just the right mix
 of humour, characters, rhyme, intrigue and morality.

It
 was closely followed by story that changed a generation of children, JK
 Rowling’s Harry Potter, and in third came A A Milnes tales of Winnie 
the Pooh and his adventures in the Hundred Acre Wood.

He's faun-ding this exhausting: 10-week-old Casper takes a nap on Aslan's back in this re-imagining of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe

A Piglet for Pooh: Charlie, 18 weeks, is getting into the role of Winnie the Pooh by munching away on honey

Time for tea: Elsa, 18 weeks, appears to have found the White Rabbit and awaits the Mad Hatter in the recreation of Alice in Wonderland

Magical: Complete with Elder Wand in hand, wrapped up in a Gryffindor scarf, and the round glasses slipping off his nose, five-month-old Fergus,  is as close to Harry Potter as any baby will get

Catnap: Little Nathan is just four weeks old, but that has not deterred him from taking on an old classic - Dr. Seuss's The Cat in the Hat

One in ten voted for Dr. Seuss’s classic The Cat in the Hat, which came in fourth, with the fifth spot claimed by Peter Pan, written by JM Barrie.

The list also includes C.S. Lewis’ first book in the Narnia series - The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe – as well as Alice in Wonderland, The Frog Prince, The Wizard of Oz and The Borrowers.

Richard
 Mayfield, creative director of Venture Photography, who created the images and conducted the survey, said: 'Stories play
 a huge part in childhood, helping to develop creative imaginations as 
well as reading skills.

'It's
 little surprise that master storyteller, Roald Dahl, tops the list - 
his books have been loved for generations.

'Hopefully our Charlie and the
 Chocolate Factory model, baby Lucas, will grow up to be a Dahl fan!'

National Storytelling Week runs from February 1 to 8.
