Eight months after federal agents brought down the man alleged to be running an underground Web site called Silk Road that had become a thriving venue for drug trafficking, not only is the site up and running again but the new version is more vibrant then ever.

A report from watchdog group the Digital Citizens Alliance claims the 'online black market economy has done a complete somersault in the 
six months since the fall of the original Silk Road.

'New players have arisen, including a second incarnation of 
‘Dread Pirate Roberts’ and a revived Silk Road (which seems to be 
thriving, even after law enforcement arrested and charged some of the 
new site’s prominent figures) has replaced the original. 

Months after the feds busted the operator behind 'darknet' site Silk Road, the site is thriving with more than 13,000 listings for drug sales online today

The Dread Pirate Roberts is the pseudonym of Ross Ulbricht, 29, who allegedly ran the site, and who now sits in jail awaiting trial on drug trafficking and money laundering charges.

Ulbricht's lawyer declined to comment for this story and his client has maintained his innocence.

The report goes on to claim that Silk Road contains approximatley 13,648 listings for drugs compared to the roughly 13,000 listed before the FBI busted the mastermind behind it, Ross Ulbricht, and shuttered, or at least attempted to shutter, the domain.

The site is perhaps the most well-known part of what's being called the 'darknet' drug economy, which taken all together now contains 75 per cent more listings for drugs.

The figures come from the report, 'Busted But not Broken,' cited by ABC News in a recent report.

A DEA spokesman declined comment.

'That just goes to show that people are still interested in partaking in
 this kind of activity, regardless of what happened to the original Silk
 Road,' said Nicolas Christin, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University. 

Silk Road transactions are often based around Bitcoin exchange - a digital currency largely unregulated and valued at $448 to one Bitcoin as of today

What has changed since the first bust, Christin said, is the feeling that one could operate on the site with impunity, such as collecting money for drugs than disappearing without sending product to the buyer.

'What has been denting consumer confidence are some of the large scams 
on those marketplaces,' he said. 'There is no longer a feeling of 
invincibility as there might have been during the heyday of the original
 Silk Road.'

Silk Road 2.0 - which 
can only be accessed through a modified internet browser - sells items 
such as cocaine, ecstasy, fake utility bills and driving licences using 
the encrypted digital currency ‘bitcoins’.

The value of one 
bitcoin - a currency not backed by a government or central bank - is 
currently equivalent to $448.

The news that the site is thriving is unsurprising, as it was reported users had taken control only weeks after the site was supposed to be closed on Oct. 2, 2013.

Authorities have found listings for marijuana, cocaine, ephedrine, and dozens of other controlled substances on Silk Road

Just weeks later, British-based user 'Saint Nic' said he
 was selling '50x Nintendo Mario Allstars 170mg MDMA Ecstasy' and they 
would be posted first-class by Royal Mail. The drugs were available for 
1.79 bitcoins (£390).

Another
 item was a fake Lithuanian passport, which the vendor 'ThreeKings' said
 can be used 'for work, migration to EU country, renting a car or other 
reasons'. This sells for 7.58 bitcoins (£1,665).

Anyone can access 
the website by creating a profile - not linked to an email account - and
 are greeted by a note from the new Dread Pirate 
Roberts.

Part of the message
 says: ‘It took the FBI two and a half years to do what they did. 
Divide, conquer and eliminate was their strategy… but four weeks of 
temporary silence is all they got.

The DEA has declined to comment on the site's resurgence as the alleged original operators await trial

‘And
 as our resilient community bounces back even stronger than ever before,
 never forget that they can only ever seize assets - they can never 
arrest our spirit, our ideas or our passion, unless we let them. We will
 not let them.’

The message -
 on the homepage of Silk Road 2.0 - adds that it has ‘implemented a 
complete security overhaul’ which ‘marks the dawn of a brand new era for
 hidden services’.

Other items available for purchase on 
Silk Road 2.0 from various sellers include fake jewellery, clothes and 
accessories, adult content and hard drives full of music albums and 
films.
