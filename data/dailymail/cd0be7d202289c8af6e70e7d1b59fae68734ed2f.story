A 14-year-old girl in Birmingham, Alabama, had a tense history with a group of girls on Facebook, but when they all decided to meet up and brawl Friday evening, the confrontation turned deadly.

The participants, who had agreed to fight and post the video online, came together at a park, but midway through the fight, shots were fired that injured two and killed Kierra'onna Rice.

AL.com reports that two shooters opened fire shortly after the girls arrived at the park, though there is no evidence the shooting was planned.

'They took it upon themselves to fire recklessly into a crowd,' Birmingham Police Lt Sean Edwards said of the shooting.

CNN reports that police arrived around  arrested two suspected of being the shooters, males aged 17 and 19, who were identified by witnesses.

14-year-old Rice was taken to Baptist Princeton Medical Center with life-threatening injuries, where she later died.

The two injured girls were taken to UAB Hospital for treatment.

Investigators say they believe one of the suspects was dating a girl that Rice and others were planning on fighting, over a Facebook fight that dated to three weeks before the incident. 

Birmingham police say that teenagers have been more willing to use guns as a way to settle disputes recently.

'We're starting to see a lot of teens armed and extremely dangerous,' Edwards said. 'We are starting to see them become more violent. They're using guns to solve their issues.'

'Fights on the street are not fair and are extremely unpredictable,' said Edwards. 'You're agreeing to accepting the harm that may take place to you and others.'
