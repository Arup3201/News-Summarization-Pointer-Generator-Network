New York City's Board of Health opened up a new, experimental front in the war on obesity Thursday, passing a rule banning sales of big sodas and other sugary drinks at restaurants, concession stands, and other eateries.

The regulation, which was proposed in the spring by Mayor Michael Bloomberg and approved by a panel of health experts after several months of review, puts a 16-ounce size limit on cups and bottles of non-diet soda, sweetened teas, and other calorie-packed beverages.

The ban will apply in fast-food joints, movie houses and Broadway theatres, workplace cafeterias, and most other places selling prepared food.

Banned: A McDonald's worker is seen preparing an order with a large beverage, possibly the last of its kind if in New York City with a new rule banning sales of big sodas and other sugary drinks

It doesn't cover beverages sold in supermarkets or most convenience stores.

The restaurant and beverage industries have assailed that the plan is misguided. They say the city's health experts are exaggerating the role sugary beverages have played in making Americans fat.

Should New York City put a 16-ounce size limit on sugary sodas?

One board member, Dr Sixto R. Caro, abstained from voting. The other 8 board members voted yes.

'I am still sceptical. This is not comprehensive enough,' Caro said.

Some New Yorkers have also ridiculed the 
rule as a gross government intrusion and tens of thousands signed a 
petition, circulated by the industry, voicing their opposition.

Too sweet: In war on obesity, the city's attack on sugary beverages, started last spring, concluded on Thursday with a unanimous vote to ban those over 16 ounces

Growing: Recently called Nanny Bloomberg over the mayor's efforts to closer monitor its residents' health and wellbeing, his office released graphs like this one, showing how the size of Coca-Cola has grown

The unprecedented regulation would follow other ambitious health moves on Bloomberg's watch.

Some have proven to be national pacesetters, such as making chain restaurants post calorie counts prominently on their menus; McDonald's announced on Wednesday that it would start displaying the information nationwide next week, before a federal requirement that could force all major chains to do so next year.

New York City also has barred artificial
trans fats from restaurant food and taken aggressive steps to 
discourage smoking. Starting this month, dozens of city hospitals are 
asking mothers of newborns to listen to talks about why they should 
breast-feed instead of using formula.

Upset: Andrea Hebert of New York, protests the soda-ban while holding a 7-Eleven Big Gulp, one of the few exceptions to the ban due to the store considered a grocery and convenience store

Still here: A Double Gulp is pictured, the largest of 20 to 50 ounce beverages sold at 7-Eleven stores with the Double Gulp when filled with Coca-Cola supplying 600 calories

Bloomberg and other advocates for the 
soda plan — who include a roster of doctors and such food figures as 
chef Jamie Oliver — see it as another pioneering step for public health.

They say the proposal strikes at a leading cause of obesity simply by giving people a built-in reason to stop at 16 ounces: 200 calories, if it's a regular Coke, compared to 240 in a 20-ounce size. For someone who drinks a soda a day, the difference amounts to 14,600 calories a year, or the equivalent of 70 Hershey bars, enough to add about four pounds of fat to a person's body.

Beyond the numbers, some doctors and nutrition experts say the proposal starts a conversation that could change attitudes toward overeating. While there are many factors in obesity, 'ultimately it does come down to culture, and it comes down to taking some first steps,' said Dr Jeffrey Mechanick, a Mount Sinai School of Medicine professor who has studied the effect of government regulation on the obesity epidemic.

Soda makers and sellers say the plan 
unfairly singles out soft drinks as culprits for the nation's fat 
problem, represents an overweening government effort to regulate 
behaviour and is so patchy as to be pointless. Because of the web of who
regulates what, it would affect a belly-buster regular soda sold at a 
sports arena but not a 7-Eleven Big Gulp, for instance.

An
average New Yorker goes to the movies about four times per year and 
buys concessions only twice, said Sun Dee Larson, a spokeswoman for the 
AMC Theatres chain.

Arguments: Critics say the city's health experts working with the mayor, pictured, are exaggerating the role sugary beverages have played in making Americans fat

Challenge: Dr Lisa Young, a researcher on portion sizes, speaks in support of the ban in front of the Board of Health at the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene though Thursday's vote is unlikely to go unchallenged

'We firmly believe the choices made 
during the other 363 days have a much greater impact on public health,' 
she said in a statement.

Thursday's vote is unlikely to be the final word on the proposal.

A soft-drink industry sponsored group called New Yorkers for Beverage Choices — which says it has gathered more than 250,000 signatures on petitions opposing the soda plan — is considering a lawsuit and exploring legislative options for challenging the plan if it passes, spokesman Eliot Hoff said. It's not clear what legislative routes there may be: City Council Speaker Christine Quinn said Wednesday she's not interested in trying to block the expected health board vote, though she has said she isn't a fan of the soda idea.

The rule wouldn't apply to lower-calorie drinks, such as water or diet soda, or to alcoholic beverages or drinks that are more than half milk or 70 per cent juice.

Enforcement would be conducted by an existing corps of city restaurant inspectors. A violation would lead to a $200 fine.
