A judge has recommended a six-month suspension for a Los Angeles attorney who posted doctored photos on her firm's website that show her with high-profile people such as President Obama, Kim Kardashian and George Clooney.

In an 18-page decision this month, Judge Donald Miles said Svitlana Sangary failed to remove the images after a State Bar warning that they were false advertising; disregarded the disciplinary process and responded to the charges with a 16-page soliloquy that had little or nothing to do with the case. 

The California Supreme Court will decide on the recommendation.

The photo that Sangary posted online looks very like this one taken in October 2007 but instead of Nicky Hilton sitting at the front row fashion show it is Sangary

The attorney says she was photographed with 'talented and successful people' at charity and political events and provided a photo link. 

State Bar Court Judge Donald F Miles says the photos posted on Sangary's law practice website 'were created by taking original celebrity photos and then overlaying (Sangary's) image in order to make it appear as though (Sangary) was in the presence of that celebrity'.

In some of the photos, Sangary even uses the same picture of herself.

Sangary put this photo online of her posing with actor George Clooney

Punishment: The California bar association is recommending that Sangary's law license be suspended for six months, and that she be put on probation for three years. Pictured above with Donald Trump 

When confronted about the pictures two years ago, Sangary didn't even trouble herself to take the photos down from the site.

According to her website, Sangary practices deals in business, real estate, foreclosure, insurance, employment and personal injury litigation

They still appeared there today, under a tab titled 'publicity'.

In fact, Miles says Sangary responded to the charges in a '16-page soliloquy with little to no rational connection to the charges at hand'.

In one particularly strange excerpt, Sangary goes on a tangent about Natalie Portman's performance in the 2010 ballet-drama 'Black Swan'  

The passage reads: 'Also, with regard to false statements and misleading advertisement, none other than Natalie Portman comes to mind. The online media extensively covers the controversy surrounding Natalie Portman's performance in the film Black Swan. 

'The ballet dancer who performed in the Black Swan, Sarah Lane, has come forward to revel [sic] a 'cover-up' and says that Natalie Portman's head was superimposed on to Sarah Lane's body, and that Natalie Portman lied.' 

She also includes an email from President Obama in the response, in which he allegedly asks her to donate to the Democratic party. 

According to the State Bar of California, Sangary graduated from Pepperdine University’s School of Law. 

She was admitted to the State Bar in 2004.

Politicians: She wrote a 16-page response to the allegations in which she goes off on several strange tangents, including one passage about Natalie Portmans' acting in the 2010 film Black Swan. Pictured above with President Obama

Final say: The decision whether to suspend Sangary's law license is up to the California Supreme Court. Pictured above with Hillary Clinton

Thanks to software editing programs it is easier than ever to pretend you are with someone you haven't met or visiting a place you have not traveled to.

There are instructions across the internet on how to fake a photo with a celebrity such as this one by Wiki How.

1. Choose a celebrity photo. Find an image with a celebrity that is not likely to have been seen all over the internet and people will recognise- a casual photo is best. Make sure it's high resolution and then save it to your computer. 

 2. Choose a photo of yourself. Try to find an image that will blend well with the celebrity picture you have selected - eg if there is a spotlight coming from the right on your celebrity image, choose a photo of yourself where there is a strong light source on the right.

3. Software. Open both photos in the editing program of your choice. Photoshop is popular but you can also find free online editors that work just as well.

4. Remove the background from your photo. Use the Magic Brush or Magnetic Lasso Tool to cut yourself out of your picture then use a remove brush to 'erase' the background. If the  background is a light white and gray checked background, this means that you are removing any background which will make it lay on top of the second photo better.

5. Drag the newly-cut image of yourself onto the celebrity picture. 

To make sure the image does not look too obviously faked there are certain tweaks that can be made. Use the eraser tool to get rid of extraneous pieces of background that came along with the image of yourself. Look at height difference - you made need to tinker with your size next to the celebrity so you are not too tall or small - ie shrink or enlarge the image of yourself. You may also need to adjust the lighting or contrast of the photo.
