A trip to the lakeside turned to tragedy Tuesday when two men died after going swimming in Lake Michigan in Chicago.

Two families out enjoying the warm weather are now mourning brothers-in-law Otmane Kassou, 40, and Ali Moufid, 36, who were pulled from the still-icy waters just after 4pm.

They were taken to Mercy Hospital in 'extremely critical' condition, where they later died.

The two men were both immigrants from Morocco, working as taxi drivers and living in the suburbs of Chicago.

According to the Chicago Tribune, Otmane Kassou went into the lake to fetch a toy for Moufid's young son that had fallen into the water.

He was fond of the child and didn't hesitate to go into the lake in search of the toy, said witnesses.

Kassou, a strong swimmer and former lifeguard in Morocco, could soon be heard calling for help, and Moufid jumped into the water to his aid.

Unimaginable: Ali Moufid's wife Malika Oujbemah (pictured) called 911 when the two men failed to resurface after entering the lake

Witnesses reported seeing two people in the water around 25 yards offshore and never seeing them resurface.

'We
 got weather that’s right around 90, and everyone thinks the water is 
that warm. It’s just above 50 degrees and that’ll really zap your energy
 real fast,' Chicago Fire Chief Mike Fox told CBS.

Ali Moufid's wife Malika Oujbemah, frantic, called 911 when she didn't see the men break the surface of the water.

'We were terrified. We didn’t know what to do,' Oujebemah told CBS. 'It was unimaginable.'

Rescue divers dropped from a helicopter into the eight-foot-deep water and quickly found the men.

Deceptive: Authorities say that despite the warm and sunny weather, the lake is still icy and can quickly sap energy from swimmers

Frantic: The two families went to the lakeside to enjoy the warm weather but their picnic soon turned into a nightmare

No swimming: Authorities are asking that no one enter the water until the beach opens and lifeguards are on duty following Tuesday's tragedy

'He’s my best friend and we lost the best guy ever,' Bachir Fagrouche, Moufid’s friend, told CBS.

Officials are telling people to wait until the beaches are open and lifeguards are on duty before swimming.

In water that cold, fire officials said, it takes just a couple of minutes for hypothermia to set in.

'His son is asking about him. Oh my god, what shall I tell my son?' a devastated Oujebemah said.

The wife of Otmane Kassou, Bouchra Kassou, described her husband as extremely fit and active. As well as being a former lifeguard, he was ex-military and a judo master who once represented the United States in international competition.

Arrangements are being made to send the men's bodies back to Morocco for burial.
