Sen. Harry Reid is back — and he's not hiding his black eye.

The Democrat broke several ribs and facial bones after falling to the ground when when a piece of exercise equipment snapped at his Nevada home on New Year's Day. 

Reid now has made his first appearance, joking about his shockingly bandaged up right eye and discussing the opening of Congress' current session.

'Most people know I fought [boxed] for a couple of years,' Reid said. 'After any one of those fights, I never looked like I do now.'

The senator then jokes that his black eye didn't come from boxer Manny Pacquiao, bull riding or riding a motorcycle.

'I was exercising in my new home,' he says in the video. 'The doctors have told me I'd better take it easy.'

Since his injury, Reid has been taking meetings at home or only with senior members of Congress.

His staff said he broke several ribs and facial bone.

Reid's office said the 75-year-old senator was hospitalized overnight at University Medical Center in Las Vegas as a precaution and was released on Friday.

His security detail had initially taken Reid to St. Rose Dominican Hospital near his home in Henderson, Nevada.

The accident happened when an elastic exercise band broke, striking Reid in the face and causing him to fall, said spokesman Adam Jentleson.

Reid struck some equipment as he fell, breaking multiple bones near his right eye.
