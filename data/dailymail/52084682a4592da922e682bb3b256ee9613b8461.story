A 12-year-old schoolgirl threatened to kill herself after internet trolls urged her to take her own life on the controversial website Ask.fm.

Kierah Gowers was targeted by anonymous bullies after signing up to the website a year ago.

The Latvian-based social network was previously linked to the death of teenager Hannah Smith, from Leicestershire, who killed herself after months of bullying online.

Now Kierah's mother Kerry Gowers, 32, from Blackpool, Lancashire, has called for the site to be shut down after her daughter received a series of spiteful messages.

One message read: 'If you don’t kill yourself now I will do it for you... kill you, your family and everyone that you love.'

Another post said: 'There is no point in you being alive... I honestly think the world would be a much better place if you were gone.'

A third said: 'Go drink bleach it will kill you or you could cut really deep.'

Kierah today said: 'I felt like I 
wanted to hurt myself. I felt like someone out there wanted me not to be
 here, so I would make it happen.'

Ask.fm is not covered by British online safety regulations as it is based in Latvia, which could make it difficult for the British Government to intervene.

It has more than 60million users worldwide and lets anyone see the names, photographs and personal details of boys and girls as young as 13.

Users post comments that range from innocent questions, to insults to threats of violence.

It has been heavily criticised by anti-bullying charities because it allows users to post anonymous comments or questions – often of a sexual or insulting nature.

Charity BeatBullying said one in three young people were bullied online and Ask.fm is among the worst offender.

She
 added: 'The messages started off with people asking questions and my 
opinion on stuff, and about half way through the year it started getting
 nasty. People were telling me I should drink bleach.

'That was the worst message I had, as well as one threatening my family. They were two weeks ago. It’s horrible there are people out there who can say things like that. I would like to see it shut down.'

Kierah, a pupil at Highfield 
Humanities College, in Blackpool, stopped going on to the website when 
the messages started, but because the site was linked to her Facebook 
account, she got regular updates of what people were writing. She has 
now closed her Ask.fm page down.

Mrs
 Gowers said: 'We don’t know who these people are or why they are doing 
it, but they have made her life a hell to the point where she threatened
 to kill herself.

'Nobody should have access to the site, 
it should be shut down. You shouldn’t give kids a tool like this where 
they can threaten to kill someone’s family and tell them to slash their 
wrists and drink bleach.

Hannah Smith, 14, killed herself after months of bullying online

Hannah Smith, 14, was found hanged in her bedroom in August after months of abuse on the Ask.fm website, whose users are able to hide their identities.

The teenager, from Lutterworth in Leicestershire, was told to drink bleach and cut herself by users of the website.

The Latvian based website has been linked to the deaths of four other teenagers including Daniel Perry, 17, from Dunfermline in July and Josh Unsworth, 15, from Lancashire in April.

Specsavers, Vodafone, Laura Ashley, EDF Energy and charity Save the Children all pulled adverts from Ask.fm amid the controversy surrounding Hannah’s death.

Kierah’s headmaster Ian Evans said staff were working on a new cyber bullying awareness project in school.

He added: 'There must be some regulatory action to take with this unfiltered, anonymous website. It is in nobody’s interest that it is allowed to continue.'

A spokesman for Lancashire Police said: 'We urge anybody who feels they have been a victim of internet abuse to contact police. Every case will be treated on its own merit and we will take all necessary and proportionate action.'
