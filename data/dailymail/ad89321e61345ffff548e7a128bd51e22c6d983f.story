The world's only 'married' lesbian threesome are expecting their first child.

Doll, Kitten and Brynn, from Massachusetts, were joined together in a marriage-style ceremony last August and are expecting a daughter in July.

Kitten, 27, is pregnant after undergoing IVF treatment using an anonymous sperm donor, and the trio eventually plan to have three children - one for each of them.

The plan at the moment is that Kitten will bear all the children - possibly using her wives' eggs and donated sperm - but they are open to other options, such as adoption.

Brynn, 34, says: 'The hope is to have three kids altogether. We always joke that the children should never outnumber the parents.'

Doll, Kitten and Brynn Young married in a ceremony in August 2013, when each of their fathers walked them down the aisle. All three women wore white wedding gowns and exchanged rings.

The so-called 'throuple' worked with a specialist family lawyer who drew up the paperwork and drafted the ceremony so that all three of them were obligated and bound to each other .

While Brynn and Kitten are legally married, Doll is handfasted to both so the threesome are as equally married to each other as legally possible.

Doll, 30, says: 'As far as we know, there aren't any other three women who are married like us.'

It was back in 2009 that Brynn first met Doll through an online dating site. Senior Software Designer and Engineer, Brynn had been married twice before to women and both experiences had made her acknowledge that monogamous relationships weren't for her.

Meanwhile Fashion Designer, Doll had known that she was polygamous since high school. She explains: 'I had always dated girls - who although they had boyfriends or girlfriends - were also allowed to date me. 

'I never thought that much about it and I had never really 'come out' as poly to my friends and family. To me, it was just how I was.'

Brynn and Doll dated for eight months before moving in together. Two years later, they purchased a house together. 

Having both enjoyed polygamous relationships before, Doll and Brynn looked for a third woman to join them. After a few failed liaisons, Doll and Brynn created an OKCupid couple's profile. Eventually, they received a message from Kitten. 

Before meeting Doll and Brynn, Kitten had been in two long-term relationships with men. Her first relationship lasted ten years and she had been engaged to her second boyfriend.

Fashion Manager, Kitten says: 'My second boyfriend and I had been together for several years but a few months before our wedding, he called the whole thing off without explanation. At first, I was distraught but now, I'm grateful for what he did. 

'The whole break-up forced me to really think about who I was and I realised that I had not been honest to myself. On reflection, I realised that I hadn't been happy in my previous monogamous relationships and I discovered that I was poly.

'I set up an OKCupid profile for myself and began dating an awesome woman with the happy consent of her husband. They were a lovely couple but we ended the relationship after I had to move away. 

'Soon after that amicable break-up, I came across Doll's and Kitten's OKCupid profile and saw they were looking for a third member to join their 'Super Hero Group'.'

The 'throuple' are eventually hoping to have three babies, one for each 'wife'

Doll, Brynn and Kitten went for dinner at a Chinese Restaurant for their first date and immediately liked each other. 

Doll says: 'There was an instant attraction with Kitten but I think we all really bonded when we baked cookies together on our fourth date. I didn't know what love was until the three of us clicked like that.'

Brynn adds: 'With Doll and Kitten, things finally made sense. It was as if the puzzle was finally complete with all three pieces.'

Within a few months, Kitten moved in with Doll and Brynn. Two years later, they decided to get married after Kitten proposed the idea to them.

Kitten says: 'I had always wanted to get married and I guess Doll and Brynn indulged my wishes! I had a very traditional upbringing and marriage had always been an important symbol of commitment for me. We wanted to celebrate our love in a wedding like everyone else.'

The threesome insist their relationship is like that of any normal couple: having breakfast with one another, watching TV after work and sharing a bed together.

Being married to more than one person is not currently legal. While Brynn and Kitten are married, Doll is handfasted to both, so the threesome are as equally married to each other as legally possible.

Doll says: 'The only difference is that communication is a lot more difficult for us than others. There are three people so our relationship takes detailed scheduling - everything we do goes on the calendar!

'Whilst communication is tricky, household chores are a lot easier with three people! You can slack off on your errands and another person can pick them up.'

Brynn adds: 'Each of us has our own allocated chores and roles - I like to think of us a romantic committee. In our relationship, I'm the traditional breadwinner. I work a forty hour week and make the majority of the family's income. 

'Doll does the cooking and Kitten does the cleaning. Sometimes, Kitten also helps me with my hair and make-up before I go to work.'

The threesome spent several date nights planning their dream wedding - making decorations and shopping for matching traditional, white gowns.

Brynn says: 'Planning our wedding was hectic. It took a lot more organizing because there were three brides involved. 

Kitten, Brynn and Doll had to work with the legalities of the state to get married to each other. As being married to more than one person is not currently legal, they had to combine handfasting, legally binding documents and legal marriage.

A family lawyer drew up paperwork - in terms of assets, wills and legal rights to children - to bind them all together as much as they could without an actual three way marriage.

Brynn explains: 'Just because we aren't the atypical configuration, I didn't want to not get married. We're very traditional people and that sense was reflected in our wedding.'

When Doll, Kitten and Brynn walked down the aisle, each of their fathers gave them away. This moment was especially memorable for Kitten as her father had previously disowned her due to his disapproval of her poly-lifestyle. 

Kitten explains: 'My father had stopped talking to me for a period of time after I came out not only as gay, but as also dating two women. 

'But shortly before the wedding, the bonds began mending and he agreed to walk me - his youngest daughter - down the aisle. It was wonderful.'

After saying their vows and exchanging rings, the girls had a drinks reception. The trio did their first dance to Kitten's favourite love song, 'I'll Stand By You' by The Pretenders'.

It was only three months after their beautiful wedding day that Kitten fell pregnant, after undergoing IVF treatment using a sperm donor. They hope to conceive using the same method with all of their future pregnancies.

Kitten says: 'The three of us have always wanted kids. Doll, Brynn and I are committed to each other and we wanted to grow our family. 

'We decided that I would be the one to carry the babies because I am more than happy to become a full-time mum. When our daughter arrives in July, I'll be the one changing the nappies and doing the feeds!'

The trio also plan on homeschooling their children to prevent them getting bullied by peers for having an unconventional family. 

Doll - who was herself teased at school - explains: 'Traditional school's tough enough for a normal kid and I don't want my child to be picked on because they're raised differently. I can't stomach the idea of putting them in the crossfire like that.'

Brynn adds: 'Through homeschooling, I think we can also educate our kids to have the same strength that Doll, Kitten and I have. 

'The three of us have been brave enough to stand tall and go against what society calls normal. I hope our child will feel free to do the same thing if they wish.' 

Doll, Kitten and Brynn are faithful to each other and say they don't plan on adding anyone else to their throuple. They hope to show the world that polyfidelity is an acceptable choice of love. 

Brynn says: 'Doll, Kitten and I may not be the norm but we are perfectly normal. We are simply people trying to live the life that we feel is best for us and we deserve the rights afforded to others.'
