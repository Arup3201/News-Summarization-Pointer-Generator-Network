AJ McCarron - who helped lead the Alabama Crimson Tide to three national championships as quarterback - thought he was sure to be a first-round NFL draft pick - second round at worst.

When he was finally drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the fifth round Saturday - 164th overall pick - he unleashed a massive Twitter rant against his critics and reports that he 'rubbed teams the wrong way.'

McCarron - who is known nearly as much for his bikini model fiance Katherine Webb as he is for on-the-field heroics - revealed that he played through several injuries at the University of Alabama and 'sacrificed a lot' to make the team successful.

Pick me! Former Alabama Crimson Tide quarterback AJ McCarron was selected in the fifth round of the NFL draft by the Cincinnati Bengals

Rant: After he was picked, McCarron went on a Twitter tirade about his critics and reports that 'personality problems' prevented him from going higher in the draft

'I never said I didn't love my time at Bama I said myself & other guys played through a lot of injuries for our great university & for fans..' he tweeted.

'To hear people make up rumors ab you that aren't true. That's what sucks when you sacrificed so much for your team & university while there!'

In April, he told an Alabama radio show that 'pretty much everyone' told him that he'd be picked by an NFL team in the first round or early in the second round of the draft.

But, according to AL.com, criticism began to mount when the draft went into the fourth and fifth rounds without any teams choosing the 23-year-old Alabama native.

One EPSN radio announcer reported that scouts saw potential in him, but team managers found he 'rubbed them the wrong way' in interviews.

Excited: On the first day of the draft, McCarron's girlfriend Katherine Webb posted a quote from scripture: 'For I know the plans I have for you... plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.' Her fiance wasn't picked for two more days in the fifth round

McCarron's fiance Katherine Webb has been his constant companion in the spotlight - ever since she catapulted to fame at the 2012 National Championship game

NFL Network reporter Ian Rapoport said teams and scouts had questions about McCarron's 'personality issues.'

'Questions from evaluators: How much do teammates really like him? How much did he really follow him,' Rapoport asked on air.

McCarron was a runner-up for the Heisman Trophy and was quarterback for two of the most powerful college football teams in recent memory - but because of the way Alabama Crimson Tide teams are built, those figures alone don't automatically translate into NFL success.

McCarron's predecessor as Alabama quarterback, Greg McElroy, was picked in the seventh round of the NFL draft in 2011. He played two games for the New York Jets and retired from football last year to become a college football analyst on the SEC Network.

Tim Tebow, who won the Heisman Trophy and a national championship with the Florida Gators, famously struggled to impress coaches in the NFL - despite one banner playoffs run.
