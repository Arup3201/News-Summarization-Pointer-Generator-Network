A man who was left with a huge dent in his head after hitting a brick wall has had it rebuilt using fat from his stomach.

Tim Barter, 32, shattered his skull, eye socket and cheekbone and was left in coma after plummeting 25 feet from a drainpipe.

But thanks to a groundbreaking procedure which used body fat to fill scars, the visual effects supervisor, who worked on the BBC TV series Dr Who, is now fully recovered and his injuries are barely visible.

It is the first procedure of its kind in Britain, specially designed to improve the outcome of facial injuries.

Surgeons at King’s College Hospital used computer technology to design titanium plates to repair Mr Barter’s smashed skull while fat from his stomach was injected into his temple.

Mr Barter, of Brixton, south London, who has now taken up rock climbing, kayaking, fencing and sky-diving, said: 'Life stopped for a number 
of months. I couldn’t work and I had double vision.

'I was frightened 
that my eyesight would never go back to normal and that I would have to 
give up my job for good.

'I’m making the most of everything 
now where I didn’t before.'

Mr Barter spent weeks at King’s following the fall which took place in June 2009 after he lost his house keys and tried to
get into his house via a drainpipe.

But the pipe collapsed under his weight and he fell 25ft hitting a brick wall on his way down.

Neighbours found him unconscious and called an ambulance.

He was taken to the major trauma 
centre at King’s College Hospital where he spent 10 days in a coma. 
Doctors discovered his leg was broken and his eye socket were shattered 
along with his cheekbone.

They had to remove part of his skull on the right hand side of his head to relieve the swelling and bleed on his brain.

Titanium plates were used for his skull and also used to reshape his shattered eye socket and keep the bone together.

These were inserted via the inside of Mr Barter’s cheek to cause minimal scarring.

After his discharge, Mr Barter was given a white hard hat similar to a builder’s which he wore to protect his head outdoors.

Robert Bentley the cranio-oral and maxillofacial surgeon who developed the technique and performed the operation.said: 'Patients having 
sustained such injuries as Tim’s highlight the fully integrated approach
that we have as a major trauma centre.

'This ensures that our patients 
receive the best treatment in the most appropriate settings and by the 
most appropriate individuals.'
