As the Oxo mother, acting in Calendar Girls or debating life on Loose Women, Lynda Bellingham has always had a special place in the nation's heart. 

In the Good Housekeeping November issue she talks openly and frankly about her battle with stage four colon cancer and explains how she made the difficult decision to cease having treatment.

'From the start I told Michael I didn't want to hang around if things got too bad. A few months ago I felt that time had come,' explained Lynda.

Linda, who has been battling colon cancer since she was diagnosed last July has decided to stop treatment 

Lynda doesn't believe in bucket lists, but says her wish is to have one last Christmas at home with her family

'For the past 16 months I have been battling cancer. I knew from the beginning the long-term prognosis was not good, but I was prepared to give it my best shot. 

'Now I feel the cancer is winning and rather than keep on fighting it, I have decided to stop the treatment that is keeping me alive. My time will be shorter – I'll live a couple of months if I am lucky – but it will be much happier for me and my family.'

Lynda, who was a panellist on Loose Women and starred in the OXO adverts in the 1980s, has weeks to live

'I have always tried very hard not to cry in front of the family. I know that if I stay positive, they will too. But one night in August I was in such agonising pain down my left side that I couldn't stop the tears. 

'The illness had gone to another level and I didn't feel like myself any more. It's the little things that get to you: the mouth ulcers, the tiredness... the difficulty of dealing with a stoma bag.'

It was the progression of her disease and the increasing side effects, as well as the bleak prognosis, that has prompted her decision to stop treatment in November – which she hopes will give her one last Christmas feeling as normal as possible.

Lynda says her biggest sadness is leaving husband Michael, who she married in 2008 

The actress, who received an OBE in March this year, is determined that people understand her decision, but not feel sorry for her

'My decision has taken such a weight from my shoulders, and the sense of relief means I can enjoy things again. As I'm very well aware, life is too short and nothing is going to stop me enjoying myself while I can.

'After November there will be no more chemo. We [her husband Michael] both know that once I stop treatment, I will have around eight weeks left.

'At the time, we just held each other and cried. But it was such a relief to say the words. The scariest thing about this disease is that you no longer feel in control. This is my way of taking back control. I'm not giving up, just being realistic.'

The actress, who received an OBE in March this year, is determined that people understand her decision, but do not feel sorry for her.

'I want my family to remember me at my best: laughing, fighting, being theatrical. Not hobbling around in pain.

'I don't believe in bucket lists. What's the point of spending all the money in the coffers and leaving everyone penniless when I'm gone? But I do have one important last wish – a lovely final Christmas with my family.

'What I want everyone to remember is that I'm 66, I've had a fantastic life and I couldn't really wish for more.

'I've thought about my funeral and chosen my favourite hymns but at the end I want to cut through it with Ethel Merman singing There's No Business Like Show Business, before everyone gets too weepy.'

Her biggest sadness is leaving husband Michael, who she married in 2008.

'It's a tragedy that having met this amazing man and been given a third chance at love – after two cock-ups! – we've only had 10 years together. It's not long enough. 

'We've both worked hard so that we could travel more and have a lovely life when we retired. I feel that I've let him down.'
