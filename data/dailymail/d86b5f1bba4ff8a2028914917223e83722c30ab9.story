'He should get out a bit more': Homosexual actor Rupert Everett (pictured) has drawn criticism from gay rights campaigners after rubbishing the idea of single-sex parents

He was seen as a champion for gay actors when he decided to come out of the closet two decades ago.

Now Rupert Everett finds himself in a somewhat less enviable position.

The 53-year-old actor has been rounded on by gay rights groups after saying: ‘I can’t think of anything worse that being brought up by two gay dads.’

Everett’s comments are likely to offend celebrity parents such as Sir Elton John and his partner David Furnish. The couple have a 21-month-old son Zachary, born to a surrogate mother.

Ben Summerskill, chief executive of the gay rights group Stonewall, said: ‘Rupert should get out  a little bit more to see the facts  for himself.

‘There is absolutely no evidence that the kids of gay parents suffer in the way they are being brought up or in how they develop.’

In a provocative interview, Everett – who played a gay father opposite Madonna in 2000 comedy  The Next Best Thing – said his mother Sara, 77, wishes he had a wife and children.

‘She has met my boyfriend, but I’d imagine she still wishes I had a wife and kids,’ he said.

‘She thinks children need a father and a mother and I agree with her.

‘Some people might not agree with that. Fine! That’s just my opinion.

Controversial views: Everett, who came out of the closet 20 years ago, starred as a gay man who makes Madonna pregnant after a one-night stand in the film The Next Best Thing (above)

Strong views: Everett, an army major's son, has in the past rubbished the idea of homosexuals having children through a surrogate

The wife of a businessman who became a sperm donor for a lesbian couple has spoken of the heart-breaking consequences of conceiving a ‘baby to order’.The woman said she initially supported her husband’s decision to help the gay couple have a child through a surrogate mother.But when it later emerged that the lesbian couple were not legally the baby’s parents, she and her husband launched a court battle to help them formally adopt the child.At one stage, she and the husband of the surrogate mother were left holding the baby at the High Court while a judge ruled the lesbians could become its legal guardians.‘To hold your husband’s child, that isn’t yours, in your arms, felt like a kick,’ said the 45-year-old. ‘It is not something you can ever recover from.‘I knew my husband was a sperm donor and supported him in this but when I knew a child had been conceived my heart broke. It is like your husband having an affair. No one ever thinks of the wives.’She said partners of sperm donors should receive consultation and counselling and criticised the determination of the middle-aged lesbian couple to have a baby.She added: ‘One thing I have learnt about couples who want to have children at any cost is that they are ultimately selfish and the only thing they think about is their need for a child.’

‘I’m not speaking on behalf of the gay community.

‘In
 fact, I don’t feel like I’m part of any “community”.

The only community
 I belong to is humanity and we’ve got too many children on the planet, 
so it’s good not to have more.’

In the same interview, Mrs Everett said she wished her son – who came out in 1989 – was not homosexual.

In the past I have said that I wish 
Rupert was straight and I probably still feel that,’ she said. ‘I’d like
 him to have children. He’s so good with children.

‘He’d make a wonderful father. But I also think a child needs a mummy and a daddy.

‘I’ve told him that and he takes it very well.’

She added: ‘From what I’m told, Rupert
 can be a little outspoken, but I don’t think he tries to upset anyone 
on purpose. He just says what’s on his mind and doesn’t suffer fools 
gladly.’

In 2009, Everett advised young gay 
actors not to come out because it would damage their careers. ‘It just 
doesn’t work and you’re going to hit a brick wall at some point,’ he 
warned.

Shortlisted for dad of the year: Sir Elton John and David Furnish, pictured with son Zachary, have not yet responded to Everett's remarks

‘You’re going to manage to make it 
roll for a certain amount of time, but at the first sign of failure, 
they’ll cut you right off.

‘The fact of the matter is, and I don’t care who disagrees, it doesn’t work if you’re gay.’
