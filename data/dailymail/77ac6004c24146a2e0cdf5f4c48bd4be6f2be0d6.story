Most parents are keen to avoid their children screaming, but father Josh Fairbank was so proud of his prank to scare his son in the shower that he posted the 29-second video on YouTube.

Mr Fairbank appears in the opening seconds of the footage, which was posted on Monday, looking into a mirror and wearing a gas mask while holding a camera and a glass of cold water.

The prankster then puts his finger to his lips as he gestures to be quiet and moments later he is creeping up on his unfortunate son in the Armageddon-like attire.

Logan screams in horror as he is confronted by his dad in the gas mask

Eleven-year-old Logan - who lives with his father in Hartford, Michigan - is singing loudly in the shower and is completely oblivious to his father's plan to scare him.

As Mr Fairbank approaches the shower and tips the glass of water over the top - and his son shouts: 'Dad you've got to be kidding!'

The terrified boy then opens the shower door, and lets out a bellowing scream - sounding like a hawk's screech - as he sees his father dressed up.

Mr Fairbank describes the video on YouTube, which has had more than one million views, as 'just a good-natured prank'.
