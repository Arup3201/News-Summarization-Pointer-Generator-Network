Police in Kansas City say they’ve stopped a potential serial killer after a man was arrested and charged with the murder of two prostitutes whose bodies were found exposed on the side of rural Missouri roads nearly a year apart.

At a news conference Saturday night, authorities said Derek Richardson, 27, had confessed to the murders of Tamara Sparks and Nicoleone Reed.

Sparks, 40, was found dead Oct. 4, 2011 and Reed, 24, was found Aug. 21. Both bodies were in spots where they could easily be seen, with their pants pulled down and shirts pulled up. Bleach had been poured over their bodies as well.

Police say Richardson described in detail what he did to the women and that he strangled them to death while wearing white gloves.

'We absolutely stopped a person who was going to kill again,' said Kansas City police Sgt. Doug Niemeier, adding that authorities will search across the United States to ensure there weren't other victims.

'We do know that he had travels elsewhere,' Niemeier said, 'so we will be contacting those states just to make sure.'

Law enforcement officials say two tips 
led them to Richardson, after their plea to the public last week for 
help. One tipster told them Richardson had told the informant about the 
killings.

A crucial piece of evidence in the case was a size 11 crocs loafer which was left at the Sparks crime scene

Police also say one crucial piece of evidence stood out – a size 11 crocs loafer which was left at the Sparks crime scene.

Another tipster told police that the shoe belonged to Richardson. Police say the tipster’s DNA was on the shoe.

'That shoe made a huge difference.  It did seem to be a small item, but you never know in a homicide or any other case what price of evidence, no matter how big or how small may solve your case,' said Niemeier.

Police say they believe Richardson was targeting these women, because he felt they were lesser than him.

He has been charged with two counts of 
first-degree murder and two counts of abandonment of a corpse and his 
bail was set at $2 million.

Cops believe that Sparks was murdered at this duplex which Richardson had lived at with his wife and child until a month ago

Richardson’s neighbour Matt Elwonger told FOX 4 News that he was cordial, but was recently evicted about a month ago.  He says the suspect lived at the duplex for about two years with a wife and child.

“It’s so surprising to me that it was literally right next door like it was happening a wall away and we didn’t hear anything or know anything was going on,” Elwonger told FOX 4 News.

Clay County authorities say they’re still looking into whether a third women who was attacked and found alive in Caldwell County is connected to Richardson.

'We have a tremendous amount of follow-up to do now that we have answered some of our own questions,' Niemeier said, adding that it 'feels good when you can tell a victim's family that their case has been resolved.'
