Arsene Wenger has admitted that even he has been surprised by how quickly Alexis Sanchez has adapted to English football.

The Chilean forward took his tally to 10 goals with a double strike to finally break Burnley's resistance and send the Gunners on their way to a 3-0 victory at the Emirates Stadium.

'I was ready to give him time if he needed it, but he has settled in much quicker than expected,' the Arsenal boss said.

Arsene Wenger admitted he has been surprised by how quickly Alexis Sanchez had settled in at Arsenal

'Now I play him through the middle and he has shown he can find the ball, he can dribble and he can go at you.

'There are similarities with (Luis) Suarez a little bit by going at you, by being where you do not expect him to be in the box, and by having that huge desire to be at the end of things.'

Following an indifferent spell, Arsenal have now won three matches in a row, and are unbeaten since losing at Chelsea before the international break.

Wenger believes the way his team continued to stay positive despite the frustrations of seeing Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton pull off a string of saves and the defenders make last-gasp blocks has them moving in the right direction again.

'In the recent games at home we were not patient and we have learned. We look a bit more balanced between offence and defence,' said manager Wenger, whose side are now fourth, above West Ham on goal difference, but still nine points off leaders Chelsea.

'We were less in trouble when we lost the ball, we were serious and that is very important in the efficiency.' 

With the return of England international Theo Walcott, who made a late cameo after 10 months out with a serious knee injury, Wenger will soon have plenty of more attacking options.

France forward Olivier Giroud is also set to be in contention following the next international break after recovering earlier than expected from a broken foot.

'For Theo it must be great as well to see that everybody wants him to come on,' said Wenger, who could give Walcott another run out on Tuesday night in the Champions League against Anderlecht when midfielder Jack Wilshere is expected to be available again after a minor knee problem.

'Lukas Podolski also played very well after he came on, he could have scored two.

'When you think that we have not got a number of offensive players like Ozil, Wilshere and Giroud, there is a lot of competition in the forward positions.'

While Wenger may feel his squad is now moving in the right direction, there remain more questions than answers for Burnley boss Sean Dyche.

However, with home matches coming up against the likes of Hull, Aston Villa and Newcastle, spirits within the Clarets camp remain high that illusive first top-flight win will come sooner rather than later to lift them off the foot of the table.

'There has to be a future on what you do. You can't rely on a lucky win, or another one because you are never going to improve and build a team,' said Dyche.

'You have to build it by method and ours is reasonably sound, but we are coming up against teams who are of a higher level, and there is no negative in that.'
