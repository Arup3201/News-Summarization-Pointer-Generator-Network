Accused: Brian Copsey, 59, allegedly stole £1,160,525 to spend on his wife and his children's school fees while he was finance director for a company run by residents to manage Bryanston Court in central London

An accountant swindled more than £1million from his neighbours at an exclusive West End apartment block to fund his 'extravagant' lifestyle, a court heard today.

Brian Copsey, 59, allegedly stole £1,160,525 to spend on his wife and his children's school fees while he was finance director for Bryanston Court Management, a company run by residents to manage Bryanston Court in central London.

Residents were left with nothing after the money 'simply disappeared into the ether' when the alleged fraud was uncovered.

Copsey forged bank documents authorising money paid in service charges by residents to be paid to his own companies, bleeding the coffers dry in £100,000 lumps, it was alleged.

Prosecutor Sarah Selby, told jurors at Southwark Crown Court today: 'The allegation against Mr Copsey is that over that period of time, a period of more than two and a half years, and whilst he was both the director and the finance chairman of a residents’ management company, that is for a block of flats called Bryanston Court where he lived, Mr Copsey dishonestly took that figure of just over £1million other residents’ money.'

Residents at the luxury apartment block in George Street, Marble Arch, where an average flat costs £1.3 million, had built up a huge war chest for the maintenance and improvements.

Ms Selby continued: 'He then used that sum of money for his own purposes, by paying for, the Crown says, his own extravagant lifestyle, by making payments to his wife and sons, and sons’ school fees, and by transferring a large amount to other companies and associates of his.'

Copsey is charged with fraud by abuse of position and transferring money between different accounts for personal gain. He denies the charges.

Ms Selby said: 'The initial fraud in count one is committed by Mr Copsey making numerous internet banking transfers. He removed a very large amount of money from the bank accounts held by the residents association.

'He was finance chairman of the residents association so he had effective control over the bank accounts and he transferred those funds of just over £1,000,000 into bank accounts held by two of his own companies.'

The two firms were called Java Creek UK Ltd and Calisto Investments Ltd, and Copsey is also charged with transferring 'large amounts' of money which he spent on himself, his family and associates.

Ms Selby continued: 'As a result of the offences, in fact, Mr Copsey cleared out entirely the bank accounts of that residents management company so that the other members were left with nothing.

'And when the offences were eventually discovered, and they were discovered at the end of 2011, Mr Copsey tried to claim to the other residents in the block that he had simply invested their money elsewhere, he said in order to obtain a better rate of interest and he claimed that he was therefore safely holding the money elsewhere and that he would return it to them the very next day.'

Jurors heard how the accountant had taken up the role of finance chairman after his predecessor left the block in 2011.

Before he took control the residents had saved up more than £2million which was being held by management company Lewis & Tucker.

Unhappy that the company was holding such a large amount of their cash they chose to open a number of HSBC bank accounts and one investment account where they would hold the money themselves.

As finance chairman Copsey had was responsible for running the association’s finances, with the operations apparently running smoothly for the first year.

But on March 15 2010 he allegedly began to bleed the accounts of huge sums of money, beginning with £100,000 being paid to a company called Heritage, a firm run by a close associate.

Just days later £30,000 arrived in Copsey’s own bank accounts, part of the money transferred to Heritage, it is claimed.

Banking staff required two people to sign forms faxed in to release the funds. According to prosecutors Copsey forged the signature of one of his co-directors on the association in order to arrange the transfers.

When police analysed his computer they found a digital copy of Henrietta Goldstein’s signature, along with copies of the transfer arrangements.

She told police she had no idea about the payments, or knew anything about Heritage as it had never been used by the block.

Wearing a navy suit, grey-haired Copsey spoke only to confirm his name when he appeared at Southwark Crown Court today.

He was bailed on the condition resides at his home address and does not apply for travel documents or leave the country.
