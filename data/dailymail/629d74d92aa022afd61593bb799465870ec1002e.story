A benefits cheat who claimed to be partially blind and disabled faces jail after being caught driving.

Kelvin Kalloo, of Dunstable, Bedfordshire, claimed nearly £100,000 in handouts from Brent Council and Central Bedfordshire Council over six years before being caught by the authorities' investigators.

The married 34-year-old was caught out after being spotted driving three different cars and working no a market stall in Watford, Hertfordshire, jurors at Harrow Crown Court were told last month.

Benefit cheat: Kelvin Kalloo, of Dunstable, Bedfordshire, claimed nearly £100,000 in handouts from Brent Council and Central Bedfordshire Council over six years before being snared by the authorities' investigators

Kalloo told both councils he was partially blind and a car crash left him unable to walk unaided. But investigators from the councils found that he had 'no apparent issues with his sight', the court heard.

They also found he was capable of walking without any help. Kalloo claimed £70,000 in benefits from Brent between 2002 and 2008 and £27,000 from Bedfordshire between 2002 and 2006.

He also made a further fraudulent claim to Bedfordshire between 2009 and 2010 for £5,700.

Kalloo claimed the payments in the form of direct payments for a carer to look after him, but the court was told that he opted to 'arrange his own care' rather than have the council provide it.

The carer was in fact his wife – but Kalloo did not even need any help and was perfectly able to walk, drive and work without any assistance. He also owned four homes, which were rented out.

He was arrested in October 2008 after investigators became suspicious and visited his home.

Officials at both councils worked together after the arrest - and Brent's legal team eventually brought him to justice. They also found he had several bank accounts with thousands of pounds in them.

Last week, after a seven week trial, Kalloo was found guilty of 10 counts of fraud. He will be sentenced on January 30.

Brent Council's deputy leader Councillor 
Ruth Moher said this week: ‘Fraud against the social care system 
directly affects some of the most vulnerable members of our community.

'It is unfair that while times are hard for many, a very small minority think it's OK to make fraudulent claims for benefits and services'

Councillor Ruth Moher, Brent Council's deputy leader

‘We are determined to root out fraud in this and all our services and take the strongest possible action against fraudsters.

‘We will not be deterred by the prospect of complex, lengthy investigations and will continue to prosecute those individuals who seek to line their own pockets at the taxpayers' expense and those in genuine need.

‘It is unfair that while times are hard for many, a very small minority think it's OK to make fraudulent claims for benefits and services.’
