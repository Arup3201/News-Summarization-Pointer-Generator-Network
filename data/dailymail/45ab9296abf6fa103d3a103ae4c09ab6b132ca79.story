This unsuspecting grasshopper didn't stand a chance when a hungry tarsier decided to swing by for dinner.

The furry primate used its strong hind legs to propel itself two metres through the air and pluck the insect from a tree trunk.

The moment was captured by a photographer who had travelled to Indonesia to see the cute creatures - which bear a striking resemblance to Furby toys thanks to their enormous eyes - in action.

Wildlife photographer Juergen Freund travelled from his home in Cairns, Australia, to Indonesia's Tangkoko National Park to observe its population of tarsiers.

The primates have grown accustomed to the watchful gaze of tourists who flock to the park just before sundown to catch the nocturnal animals as they wake up.

'When I finally got to see them I thought they were the cutest little fur balls of all time,' said Mr Freund, who snapped the remarkable pictures on a Nikon D3X camera.

'They had these high-pitched squeaks to communicate with each other and their eyes were just so big in relation to their body,' he added.

Mr Freund patiently waited for the snoozing tarsiers to wake up and start foraging for insects.

'I trekked for an hour to the hollowed strangler fig tree where the tarsiers were sleeping and waited there until they woke up so I could capture this,' he said.

'I thought I saw Yoda every time a tarsier woke up and came out of its sleeping tree.'
