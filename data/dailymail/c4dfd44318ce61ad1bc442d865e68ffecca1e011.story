Two offshore racers have been killed after their powerful speedboat flipped up into the air before crashing at high speed at a world championship event.

Spectators and organisers watched as Big Thunder Marine - a 46ft Skater catamaran with four 1,200 horsepower engines - was almost torn open by the force of the collision.

The powerboat came down so hard in the third lap of the seven-lap race that its right front hull was severely damaged.

The accident led to the deaths of throttleman Robert M. Morgan, of Sunrise Beach, Missouri, and driver Jeffrey Tillman, of Kaiser, Missouri.

The race was halted following another accident because rescue services were severely stretched at the event.

The tragedy marred the opening day of three days of racing at the Key West World Championship event.

Superboat International President John Carbonell said he witnessed the crash, which occurred yesterday next to a spectator area inside Key West Harbour in Florida.

'He was probably going about 130mph and the boat's propellers were barely in the water,' Mr Carbonell said.

'The boat apparently caught some air and went bow (front) up; straight into the air, came down and went backwards.'

Mr Carbonell said rescue divers were deployed to the accident site in less than a minute.

Both men were removed alive from the wreckage of the catamaran and transported to Lower Keys Medical Center, he added.

Mr Tillman died either before or just after arrival at the hospital.

Organisers said Mr Morgan died soon after leaving Key West aboard an air trauma ambulance.

Mr Carbonell said the force of the boat hitting the water was powerful and crushing.

Mr Morgan had come out of retirement to race this year, Mr Carbonell said.

'He told me a few days ago that this 
(Key West) was his last hurrah,' he said. 'He was a helluva of a nice 
guy and is going to be missed.'

Despite the accident and rescue efforts, the race later continued.

But Mr Carbonell said he stopped the 
race before the scheduled seventh lap due to another accident, which 
stretched medical and safety resources.

Scott Roman of Marlton, New Jersey, and Ron Roman of Lumberton, New Jersey, escaped injury after their Motley Crew boat overturned.

Mr Carbonell said that the world championship will continue with scheduled races on Friday and the finals on Sunday.

'This is a very dangerous sport and the racers know that,' he said. 'You push it to the edge and see how far you go.'
