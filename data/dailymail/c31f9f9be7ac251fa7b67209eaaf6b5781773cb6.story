It may look like a giant misshapen bouncy castle, but this building would - if it is built - be an ultra-clean, shape-shifting office.

The bizarre design has been proposed by Shanghai 
and Rome-based studio 3GATTI, which has previously created 
umbrella-fronted buildings and grass-covered telecoms towers.

The ‘Bubble Building’ design could be created using inflatables made of white antibacterial nylon that are placed in front of the exterior of an ordinary office in central Shanghai.

It may look like a giant misshapen bouncy castle, but this building will in fact be an ultra-clean, shape-shifting office

3GATTI said that this ‘renovation of a common, old and unattractive building’, will not only improve the Shanghai skyline but also help keeps germs out of the office.

The bubble shapes on the outside of 
the building have been designed to move with the wind and interact with 
people inside the building.

When people are in the offices, the exterior will be fully inflated to keep the ventilation high.

As people leave the office, the bubble façade will become deflated as the ventilation is turned down.

The billowing exterior also has an environmental aspect, as the air space between the fabric and the window act as efficient insulation to keep a desirable interior temperature

By placing plants between the framed glass panes and the antibacterial nylon, the architects have created a ‘micro greenhouse’ which keeps temperatures constant despite the weather.

3GATTI said its concept was to ‘create an icon-building, a kind of landmark very easy to recognise, a kind of sculpture with a strong character able to detach itself from the boring cityscape.’

One problem, however, is that the lack of view provided by the structure. This might not seem so bad, if you don’t mind stepping into giant bubble every time you go to work.
