Aldi has cleaned up in the washing-up wars after new research found its own brand washing-up liquid performs better than its competitors and it is more than half the price of its nearest rival.

The latest Which? washing-up liquid tests reveal Aldi as the winner for the first time just pipping Fairy Platinum to the prize.

And a pound's worth can wash a staggering 14,873 plates compared to Fairy Platinum's 5,069.

Aldi's budget washing-up liquid has topped the poll according to a value for money test by Which?

Researchers put 13 washing-up liquids from supermarkets and major brands up to the test, ranging from Tesco Lemon washing-up liquid to Persil Lemon Burst.

The products were tested on a number of factors including fat removal, foam duration, plates washed per £1, and plates washed per 100ml.

Researchers tested the washing-up liquid's fat removal quality by pouring 1.2kg of animal fat on to 742 plates and counting how many are cleaned until the fat starts being re-deposited on the plates.

The foam duration measures how long the foam lasts before it looks like you have to change the water, and how good the product is at cleaning less intensive grime.

The final score was calculated by adding the results from the fat removal and foam duration tests and coming up with a percentage score.

Fairy Liquid was able to wash 5,000 plates for every £1 worth of the product according to researchers 

The final scores ignored the price of the product, and concentrated on the performance tests.

Aldi Magnum Premium washing-up liquid topped the charts with a final score of 89 per cent, one per cent higher than the score Fairy Platinum Original received.

Researchers found that the Aldi washing up liquid cost 79p, and washed 14,873 plates per £1 of the product, and washed 2,350 plates per 100ml.

Whereas, Fairy Platinum Original costs £1.70, and washes just 5,069 plates per £1 and 2,250 plates per 100 ml of the product.

A Which? spokesman said: 'We first tested washing up liquid in 1959 and this year we've put 13 washing- up liquids from supermarkets and major brands to the test and found Aldi's Magnum Premium washing-up liquid performed the best, with a score of 89 per cent.

'It was also great value for money at 79p for 500ml.

'Fairy Platinum was a close second, with a score of 88 per cent, but was more expensive at £1.70 for 383ml.

'Aldi and Fairy washed a similar numbers of greasy plates per 100ml, but Aldi's Magnum Premium washed nearly three times as many plates per £1 spent.

'Tesco's Expert Lemon washing-up liquid was the worst performing with a score of 37 per cent and only washes 1,200 plates per 100ml.

'Aldi's Magnum Premium, in comparison, washes 2,350 plates per 100ml.

Which? editor, Richard Headland, said: 'We first tested washing up liquid 55 years ago, but the past few years seem to have been the most competitive with supermarket own labels giving the major brands a run for their money.'
