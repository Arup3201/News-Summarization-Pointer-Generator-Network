George Groves has taken heavyweight Luke Watkins under his management wing.

Groves, who will bid to bid to bounce back from two stoppage defeats to Carl Froch next month, took out his manager's licence in April.

Watkins will make his professional debut on the Wembley Arena undercard on September 20 and both Groves and Watkins are trained by Swindon-based Paddy Fitzpatrick.

Watkins tweeted: 'It's a done deal. George Groves is now my manager!'

Groves takes on Frenchman Christopher Rebrasse for the European super-middleweight title. The fight doubles as a final eliminator for the WBC world title held by Sakio Bika.

Groves was stopped in the eighth round of his rematch with Froch at Wembley in May following their controversial first encounter last November.
