Being Prime Minister is at times like being stuck in a sitcom, David Cameron admitted today as he tore into the ‘enormous bureaucracy’ Whitehall produces.

Mr Cameron said there were ‘elements of truth’ in shows like Yes, Prime Minister which chronicled the endless conflict between civil servants and their political masters.

And he complained that even after almost three years in charge he is still frustrated at the amount of paperwork the government machine produces.

David Cameron said there were 'elements of truth' about the political sitcom Yes, Prime Minister as he railed against the 'enormous bureaucracy' of life in Whitehall

One of Mr Cameron’s closest aides, policy guru Steve Hilton, lifted the lid on Whitehall life when he revealed the PM often only finds out what the government is doing by listening to the radio.

The inability of No 10 to control government decisions was ‘pretty horrific’, Mr Hilton said.

Mr Cameron admitted he agreed with much of Mr Hilton said.

The PM said: ‘He’s right to say there’s an awful lot of bureaucracy and red tape and quangocracy.’

The sitcom Yes, Prime Minister returns to British TV screens tomorrow with the first new series for 25 years, chronicling the exasperation of PM Jim Hacker and his battles with mandarin Sir Humphrey Appleby.

Mr Cameron admitted that real life in Number 10 mirrors art, with the fictitious comedy containing ‘elements of truth’ about his own experience in power.

‘Of course there are elements. In all of these programmes, there are always elements of truth, otherwise they wouldn’t be as funny and amusing as they are.’

He went on: ‘A lot of the paperwork that comes through government relates to the fact that we’ve got an enormous bureaucracy.

‘There are too many quangos, there are too many rules including those that are coming from Brussels, and we need to cut that back, we need to deregulate, we need to reduce the number of quangos – all of which we are doing.’

The Prime Minister said he had a good relationship with civil servants, ahead of Yes, Prime Minister returning to British TV screens tomorrow night, starring Henry Goodman and David Haig

But he was at pains to praise the civil service too, insisting: ‘I have a good relationship with the civil servants I work with.

‘It is a robust relationship, and we are changing the civil service – there are some radical reductions taking place, there’s a lot of reform taking place, but I would praise them for the work they do.

‘And I think in the end, if you have ministers who have a clear view of what they want to change in Britain, then you are capable of delivering it with our civil service.’

Painting a shambolic picture of the 
Downing Street operation, Steve Hilton said the inability of No 10 to 
control government decisions was ‘pretty horrific’.

‘Very
 often you’ll wake up in the morning and hear on the radio or the news 
or see something in the newspapers about something the Government is 
doing,’ he said.

‘And
 you think, well, hang on a second – it’s not just that we didn’t know 
it was happening, but we don’t even agree with it! The Government can be
 doing things... and we don’t agree with it? How can that be?’

Mr
 Hilton revealed that ministers spend only 30 per cent of their time 
dealing with the Government’s priorities, with 40 per cent spent 
handling diktats from the European Union and the rest on ‘random 
things... which were not anything to do with the coalition agreement’.

He
 described how No 10 is frequently left out of the loop as important 
policy changes are pushed through by ‘paper-shuffling’ civil servants 
who made life ‘impossible’ for ministers by drowning them in paperwork. 
‘The bureaucracy masters the politicians,’ he said.
