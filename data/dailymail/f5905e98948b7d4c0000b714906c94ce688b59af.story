Grandmother Patricia Barden (pictured here in an old image), 77, who died after falling into a cesspit in her garden

A grandmother drowned after falling into a 14ft-deep cesspit in her garden.

Patricia Barden, 77, was walking outside her house when a rusty manhole cover gave way beneath her.

She plunged into the cesspit, which was two-thirds full, and would have been unable to climb up its smooth sides.

Police who were called to the home found her shoes nearby and told an inquest she may have hurled them out in a desperate attempt to attract help.

It is not clear how long she survived but nearly four days elapsed between the last time someone spoke to her and when her body was found at the detached £450,000 property in Milden, near Ipswich.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Dr Dan Sharpstone, assistant deputy coroner for Suffolk, said: ‘The metal cover and brickwork was in a poor state... it was described as a death trap.

‘Mrs Barden fell into the cesspit and we have heard there was no feasible way of getting out. Tragically, she drowned.’

Widow Mrs Barden had lived alone since her husband, Charles, died in 1994. Her daily routine involved getting up at 7.30am and having a walk and a cup of tea in her beloved garden.

Suffolk Police were called to the house at 1am on July 2 last year after a concerned family member said they were unable to get in contact with her.

They were let in by her step-granddaughter, Charlotte Rush, who drove up from Kent with a set of keys. The doors were locked and there was no sign of trouble but an officer made the grim discovery in the garden.

Detective Inspector David Giles told the inquest in Bury St Edmunds: ‘An officer noticed an open manhole and, with the use of a torchlight, saw what was believed to be a body in the bottom of the pit, in the water.

Suffolk Police were first called to the house at 1am on July 2 last year to find all the doors locked and no sign of any trouble

‘We concluded that somehow she had 
fallen in. The access to the cesspit was heavily corroded. I think at 
some point she stood on the cover and it has given way as there is no 
strength there. If you had gone in there, you wouldn’t have been able to
get out without any assistance. We will never know exactly the day that
she fell or how long she was in there.’

Mrs Barden’s body was removed by firefighters on July 3 and she was pronounced dead by a paramedic.

'She
lived her life to the full and we are all extremely sad that she is no 
longer with us,'

- Step-granddaughter Charlotte Rush

A post mortem examination  confirmed 
the cause of death was drowning. Receipts showed she went to a 
supermarket in Sudbury on June 27 last year and Miss Rush’s cousin spoke
to her the following day.

An inspection by a drain inspector revealed 
the fragile state of the manhole cover and that the surrounding 
brickwork and concrete was so corroded it could barely support its 
weight.

Reading a statement submitted by Miss 
Rush, Dr Sharpeston said: ‘Her step-grandmother was an active person who
drove to local towns and had a nice life.’

Residents near Mrs Barden’s home paid 
tribute to her as a ‘pillar of the community’ who was ‘articulate’ and 
‘well-presented’. She held numerous fundraising events including coffee 
mornings and bazaars for her local church, St Peter’s.

Speaking after the inquest, Miss Rush,
30, said: ‘My beloved nan, Patricia, was the best nan in the world. She
lived her life to the full and we are all extremely sad that she is no 
longer with us.’
