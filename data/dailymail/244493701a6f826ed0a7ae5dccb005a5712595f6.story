Tragedy: Ian Anderson says he watched as police shot his service dog Burberry 

A man lost his best friend on Sunday after he says a police officer shot and killed his beloved service dog Burberry while responding to a call in the neighborhood.

Ian Anderson of San Diego says he's absolutely heartbroken after being forced to watch police shoot his 6-year-old pit bull Burberry over the weekend.

He says it's all because the dog was spooked and was barking.

NBC reports that officers were called just before 5:30 a.m. on Sunday for a domestic disturbance call in Anderson's neighborhood.

When police arrived they were confronted by the 50 to 60 pound dog Burberry  and one of the officers fired his gun.

Anderson claims that Burberry started barking when police knocked on his door and that they even had the wrong address for the domestic dispute call.

He says that no arrests were made that night.

Anderson says one officer petted the pit bull but that the other officer reacted with fear at seeing the dog and hearing him bark.

'The other officer yelled and screamed at the dog for no reason to get inside. It startled the dog,' Anderson said.

'[The officer] jumped back, went this way, drew his weapon,' he said.

'Boom. Shot right in the head and he was done. He was dead.'

Dead: Burberry, 6, was a service dog who helped children with Down syndrome and aided Ian Anderson with his debilitating anxiety following the death of his father 

Anderson says his dog was the best dog that anyone could ever ask for and that he helped children with Down syndrome.

Anderson said that dog also helped him to overcome his debilitating sadness after losing his father.

'They’re there to put their heads on your lap and you know everything is going to be okay. There's just no way to explain the bond,' he said.

Member of the family: Ian Anderson says that Burberry was the best dog anyone could ever ask for and was like a member of his family 

Surveillance: There is footage of the shooting and a police officer can be seen petting the dog as another officer later shoots the dog in the head once it starts barking 

'He was the best dog in the entire world,' Anderson said as he held back his tears.

'I would do anything to have him back right now. Absolutely anything. 

The San Diego Police Department issued a statement following the incident.

'The preservation of life is our top priority and this includes the lives of animals. This incident is currently being investigated as any Officer Involved Shooting would be to assure proper procedures were followed. Any further comments prior to the completion of the investigation would simply be premature.'

Service dog: Burberry was dedicated to helping children with Down syndrome as a certified service dog

Tragic end: Burberry, pictured celebrating his fifth birthday, was just six-years-old when he died
