Lucky escape: Joanne Durkin, pictured with her husband Patrick and son Daniel, was saved by a passing GP when her heart stopped as she was driving

A mother-of-two whose heart stopped as she was driving through a busy city centre was saved when a passer-by stepped in to give her CPR.

Joanne Durkin, 43, was driving through York City Centre when her heart stopped and she collapsed behind the wheel.

Staff from a nearby Turkish restaurant called Kapadokya saw the car roll to a stop and ran to the mother's aid.

They then smashed a car window and pulled Mrs Durkin free from the vehicle.

A woman, believed to be from Liverpool who was Christmas shopping in the city, identified herself as a GP. She then performed heart massage until paramedics arrived.

Mrs Durkin said: 'You really couldn't make up what happened. It's amazing that so many different factors came together that day to save my life.

'I still feel tired, but I'm so thankful that everything is going to be okay. My guardian angel really must have been looking after me that day.'

Mrs Durkin has no recollection of the incident but she, husband Patrick, and sons Matthew, 18, and Daniel, 11, have thanked the heroic members of the public and the emergency services.

The mother was later diagnosed with Long QT Syndrome - an electrical disturbance to the heart and can cause death.

Mrs
 Durkin has been fitted with an implant with a built-in defibrillator 
which will restart her heart should this ever happen again, and she is 
on medication to help control her heart rate.

Mr Durkin, 51, said: 'She was given a blast with the defibrillator and brought back round.

'Her heart stopped again in the ambulance but they started her up again and got her to A&E. She was just so lucky that someone was there at the time to help her.

Scene: The mother-of-two was driving past the Kapadoyka restaurant in York, pictured, when her heart stopped.

'The car came to a stop with no damage. It's miraculous really because obviously she just blacked out. She's been unlucky, but there's been so much luck involved it's unbelievable.'

'[Long QT Syndrome] can be classed as instant death syndrome which is quite a scary thing to think about.

'Ten minutes later she would have been in the middle of nowhere on a much quieter road and it would have been a much different story.

'She had just minutes to survive. It was just unbelieveable. She ran the marathon in October, she runs all over the place, she's as fit as a fiddle.

'I would have thought there would be more chance of Stonehenge falling over than Joanne falling over.'

Erdal Ozturkce, manager of Kapadokya, was one of the people who helped Joanne at the scene, and was amazed to find out she was well and at home for Christmas.

Diagnosis: Mrs Durkin has since been diagnosed with Long QT Syndrome, an electrical disturbance of the heart

He said: 'Her face changed colour when her heart stopped and we thought she was dead. I'm really very happy she's okay, it's really good to hear.

'I'm really happy she's alive, because we were really very upset. I didn't know her at all, but she's human and young, and it would be very sad for someone to die at Christmas time.'

The mother is now launching an appeal to thank the GP who helped to save her life when her heart stopped while she was behind the wheel.

Speaking from their family home today, Mr Durkin said: 'We just want to say thank you to them. I just want to share our gratitude which is endless, because they saved Joanne's life.

'You can't do anything better than that for a fellow human being.'
