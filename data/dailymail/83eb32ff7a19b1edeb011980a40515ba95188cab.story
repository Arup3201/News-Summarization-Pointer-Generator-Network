In a world of more than seven billion people, everyone is said to have a double - but 
rarely do the two ever meet face to face.

So, when these art lovers unexpectedly bumped into their doppelgangers, they couldn't just let the chance meeting pass them by.

The shocked visitors posed with their art lookalikes - immortalised in paintings, murals and even masks.

A-king: This man got into the true spirit of the discovery by dressing up in a Henry VIII costume similar to the worn by his Tudor counterpart

Forlorn: This painting, depicting a saddened young woman, is outshone by her real-life doppelganger - who is pulling a similarly miserable face

Locks-alike: Dressed in a black t-shirt to mimic his eccentric double's dark clothing, all this frizzy-haired man is missing is a dog

Some had travelled miles to galleries and museums across the world to track down their double, before posting photos of their discovery online.

One even got into the true spirit of the find by dressing up in a Henry VIII costume similar to the worn by his Tudor counterpart.

The man donned an intricate cloak, black hat and poured a glass of wine, before posing in front of a painting of the monarch.

He had even cut and shaped his ginger beard to match that of the former King, who is known for having six wives and separating the Church of England from Catholicism.

Battle-ready:: This man is posing with his armour-clad knight lookalike, who is readying himself for battle with his horse

Impersonation: This women pulls a face for the camera as she impersonates her statue double

Striking a pose: A young man is pictured in front of his religious counterpart, left, while one art lover was so impressed with his lookalike, right, that he bought the painting and took it home

Among the hilarious snaps - posted on photo blog The Chive - is a shot of a man with dark frizzy hair, a moustache and a beard, stood smiling in front of a painting of his equally hairy lookalike.

Dressed in a black t-shirt to mimic his eccentric double's dark clothing, all he is missing is a dog.

Another photo shows a man posing with his armour-clad knight double, who is readying himself for battle with his horse.

The art admirer, who is dressed a notably more modern blue t-shirt, is gazing into the distance with the same strong-willed stare as the horseman.

Friendly snap: This painting, displaying two young males, is eerily similar in appearance to a couple of camera-ready teens

Bearded doppelganger: This old gentleman has found his long-deceased double in this painting

One painting, depicting a forlorn young woman, is outshone by her real-life doppelganger - who is pulling a similarly sad face.

And another, displaying two young males, is eerily similar in appearance to a couple of camera-ready teens.

One art lover was so impressed with his historic double that he bought the painting and hung it in his house.

The bearded pair, who lived centuries apart, have a shared taste in long, bushy hair - but probably not in home furnishings.

Not so innocent: This cheeky chap poses in front of his angelic counterpart

Tragic double: This bearded man pretends to suffer an equally horrible fate as his lookalike

Shock discovery: Max Galuppo is among the people to have upload photos of their art doppelgangers online

Other photos include a young man posing in front of his religious counterpart, a woman staring at a similar-looking mask and another female doing an impersonation of her statue double.

College student Max Galuppo is among the people to have upload photos of their art doppelgangers online.

Mr Galuppo, who attends Temple University in Philadelphia, US, spotted his medieval double in a 16th century Italian painting at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

His lookalike, who is immortalised in Portrait of a Nobleman with Dueling Gauntlet by an unknown artist, is wearing a black velvet top with long sleeves and red tights.

Needless to say, Mr 
Galuppo is wearing a tie-dye t-shirt that is likely to be met with more approval by his college peers.
