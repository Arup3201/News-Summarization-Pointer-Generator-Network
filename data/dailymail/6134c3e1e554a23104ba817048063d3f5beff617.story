British drinkers are set to spend more on wine the French in the coming years following a boom in sales for more expensive bottles.

Britons are increasing buying higher-priced 'premium' wines and now regularly spend more than £7 on a bottle, research reveals.

The UK is set to spend more than £11billion on reds, whites and roses by 2018, making it the second biggest market for wine after the US.

By then, wine consumption will reach reach 1.54billion bottles - the equivalent of 22.5 litres per head - according to a forecast by  International Wine & Spirit Research for wine exhibition Vinexpo.

Its report found the amount spent on wine fell during the recession, but is now increasing again as the UK economy recovers.

In the last five years, consumers have not been drinking increased amounts of wine - but are instead spending more on bottles when they do have a glass.

Overall consumption of wine is, however, now expected to rise for the first time since 2008.

The continued popularity of Prosecco is partly behind the increase in trade - with a 43 per rise seen on imports of the Italian sparkling wine in recent years.

Between 2008 and 2013, the number of cases of Prosecco brought into Britain more than doubled from 1.38million to 3.57million, the report found.

Vinexpo's Guillaume Deglise said: 'We can say confidently that 2015 will show that the UK wine recession is over.

'While the UK market shed 9.6million cases between 2008 and 2013, it is now past its low point. The UK wine trade is building value and many leading marketers report progress at the premium end'.

White wine is the UK's favourite, with 676.7 million bottles bottles expected to be drunk this year, rising to 698.7 million bottles by 2018.

Spanish reds are becoming more popular, as drinkers turn their backs on French wines such as Bordeaux.

Imports from Spain rose by 25 per cent between 2009 and 2013 - while imports from Chile, Australia and South Africa dropped.
