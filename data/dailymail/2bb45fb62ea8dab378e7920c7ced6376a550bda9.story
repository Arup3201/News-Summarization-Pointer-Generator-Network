Arsene Wenger has hinted Arsenal's transfer business is finished after the capture of Gabriel Paulista.

The transfer window shuts on Monday night, but having signed Gabriel and Krystian Bielik, Wenger - who says Francis Coquelin is '99 per cent' certain to sign a new contract - says his chequebook is now likely to stay closed. 

'If I wake up in the morning and somebody’s stood in front of my door who is an exceptional player, I will open the door,' Wenger said. 'It looks very unlikely now. I can give you my address if you want.' 

Gabriel Paulista completed his £11.2million switch from Villarreal to Arsenal on Wednesday 

Alexis Sanchez is unlikely to be risked by Arsenal for their game against Aston Villa on Saturday

Manager Arsene Wenger confirmed that Sanchez is unlikely to play at the Emirates Stadium 

Gabriel looks set to make his debut for the club against Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon.

'We are in a job where competition exists,' Wenger added. 'The best player of the moment plays. 

'He’s ready to go. He’ll be in the squad certainly. He started training on Thursday and he looks fit.

'I saw great quality. His level of concentration, he's quick, has great commitment and he's young.'

Sanchez will be given every opportunity to prove his fitness. 

'We will test him on Saturday. It is unlikely that I will risk him on Sunday. We’ll see.'

And Wenger inferred that he expects Paul Lambert's Villa to start hitting the net on a more regular basis soon. 

'There’s a distortion between the quality they have going forward [and their goal record],' he said. 'When you look at the names they have on their team sheet, they have (Christian) Benteke, (Gabriel) Agbonlahor and (Andreas) Weimann who can all score goals. 

'They suffered a lot from Agbonlahor’s injury after Benteke was out for a long time. When everybody’s there, it is a team who looks quite dangerous going forward.'
