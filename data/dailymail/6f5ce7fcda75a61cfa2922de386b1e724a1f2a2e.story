Campaigner: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has long been keen to publish the unedited cache of U.S. cables

Campaigning website WikiLeaks has published its full cache of over 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables. Unlike previous releases, sensitive information has not been redacted from the cables.

The newspapers which previously worked with WikiLeaks have criticised the publication, saying it could endanger whistleblowers and dissidents in oppressive regimes.

But the website's founder Julian Assange has been adamant since last year that 'the cables must eventually be made public', according one of his former employees.

Guardian journalist James Ball, who worked at WikiLeaks for two months from November, also claims that Mr Assange tried to use money donated to WikiLeaks to pay for his defence against sexual assault allegations in Sweden. Mr Assange denies this claim.

Selected diplomatic cables were first released in December 2010, with information such as the names of sources deleted.

The cables were published by WikiLeaks and five newspapers from around the world: the New York Times, the Guardian, Le Monde, Der Spiegel and El Pais.

All five have now issued a joint statement condemning the release of unedited cables, saying they 'deplore the decision' and that it 'may put sources at risk'.

They continue: 'We cannot defend the needless publication of the complete data - indeed, we are united in condemning it. The decision to publish by Julian Assange was his, and his alone.'

The newly published collection of 251,287 cables contains over 1,000 messages which identify overseas activists, and around 150 identifying whistleblowers.

A danger to whistleblowers? The diplomatic cables previously had sensitive information redacted

WikiLeaks blames a Guardian journalist for its decision to release the uncensored cache. In his book on WikiLeaks, David Leigh published a password which he was given by Mr Assange to access the data.

He claims not to have known that the password was still valid for the file containing the unedited cables, which has been available on file-sharing websites since Mr Assange's arrest last December.

WikiLeaks now says the availability of the cables has forced it to release them in a searchable and easily accessible format.

However, former WikiLeaks employee James Ball claims that the website's eccentric boss had long planned to release the uncensored data.

Mr Ball wrote in the Guardian today that in a discussion over whether or not to publish all the cables, Mr Assange was adamant that they should eventually do so, 'one way or another'.

That claim appears to be supported by a written record of the discussion seen by Reuters, which describes a heated argument over the cables' release, with Mr Assange 'insistent all cables must somehow be eventually released.'

Following the potentially endangering release, Mr Ball has argued that 'WikiLeaks has done the cause of internet freedom - and whistleblowers - more harm than U.S. government crackdowns ever could.'

In a further blow to the campaigning Mr Assange, Mr Ball has claimed that Mr Assange 'attempted to access WikiLeaks funds received through donations' to fund his defence against allegations that he sexually assaulted two women in Sweden last year.

He is currently on bail as he fights extradition from Britain, having paid for his defence with help from celebrity supporters.

This article was amended on 8 March to include Mr Assange’s denial that he had ‘tried to use money donated to WikiLeaks to pay for his defence against sexual assault allegations in Sweden’. He also points out that all WikiLeak’s donation funds are independently administered and audited, as detailed on the WikiLeaks website.
