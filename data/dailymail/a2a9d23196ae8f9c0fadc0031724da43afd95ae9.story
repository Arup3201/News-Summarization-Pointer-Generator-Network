Two thugs convicted but then cleared of robbing a student in a defining moment of last summer’s riots demanded compensation last night.

John Kafunda and Reece Donovan want cash and an apology following the quashing of their convictions.

They thanked ‘British justice’ as they walked free from the Court of Appeal on Thursday, showered in champagne. They said it was ‘the best time of their lives’.

The pair celebrate as they leave court. At Wood Green Crown 
Court, Mr Kafunda was jailed for four years and three months for robbery
and violent disorder, and Mr Donovan for five years for robbery, 
violent disorder and burglary

The pair, who both have criminal 
records, were dubbed the ‘Bad Samaritans’ when they were jailed for attacking Ashraf Rossli, a 21-year-old from Malaysia.

Mobile phone footage of two men 
rifling through the rucksack of the badly injured and disorientated 
student at the height of the disorder shocked the world.

Kafunda and Donovan, both 23, were 
identified by anonymous witnesses, gave false alibis and were placed at 
the scene of the crime by mobile phone data.

But they were sensationally freed after a secret hearing by a panel of judges found the witnesses could not be relied upon.

From nowhere, an apparent Good Samaritan walks up and lends a hand to help heave the struggling and injured victim up from the pavement

Infamous: Millions of people around the world 
watched in horror CCTV footage of 21-year-old Ashraf Rossli being robbed
by men purporting to be Good Samaritans

Discarded: The thief, having taken the items from the teenager's bag, then casually throws them to the floor before strolling away

Scotland Yard said it could not reopen its investigation because there was no evidence anyone else was behind the crime.

Detectives said every lead on the case had been ‘exhausted’ and they could not start again without fresh information.

Kafunda and Donovan, who served 16 
months, shouted ‘get in!’ and ‘free men’ as they bounded down the steps 
of the Royal Courts of Justice.

Hugging his mother Lisa, Donovan said 
police must now apologise, adding: ‘The police, the way the police 
investigated, everything they did was wrong. The trial at the end of the
day was an unfair trial, things that should have been said were not 
said.’

Asked how he felt, Kafunda added: 
‘Shock isn’t even the word. I don’t know how to put this, if I could put
everything into one word, this is the best time of our lives. I know 
they took 16 months off our lives but this is the time just to show 
people that this is what British justice can do.’

Riot victim: Accountancy student Ashraf Rossli, 20, had only arrived in Britain a month before the attack. Here he is pictured

brother Mohammed Fatiri

Shocking amateur footage on YouTube showed Mr Rossli being robbed in Barking, East London, on August 8, 2011.

Moments earlier the young accountancy 
student, who had been in the UK only a month, had his jaw shattered by 
another rioter as he cycled through a crowd.

As blood poured from his mouth one man
put his arm around his shoulders while the other went through his 
rucksack before strutting away with a £500 games console.

Kafunda and Donovan insisted it was 
not them. But a Wood Green Crown Court jury convicted them on the back 
of evidence from anonymous witnesses.

One said he recognised Donovan’s 
clothes and his distinctive walk and another identified Kafunda from 
part of his face and his tracksuit bottoms.

The trial judge said the pair brought shame on the country and branded the footage an ‘iconic image of lawlessness’.

Mr Rossli was treated at Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, following the attack

Kafunda, who grew up in care, was 
jailed for four years and three months for robbery and violent disorder.
Donovan, a heavy cannabis user with convictions for theft, affray and 
assaulting a police officer, was jailed for five years for robbery, 
violent disorder and burglary.

But all the convictions were 
overturned by the country’s top judge, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord 
Judge. His panel has yet to give full reasons.

A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said the hearing was held in private to protect the identity of the witnesses.

Solicitor Kelli Love compared her 
clients’ case to that of Barry George who was wrongfully convicted of 
murdering TV presenter Jill Dando.

She said: ‘They wanted somebody who fitted the bill.’

Barking MP Margaret Hodge called on the authorities to try again to catch those responsible.

But a Met spokesman said: ‘All lines 
of inquiry have been exhausted and no further investigation can be 
undertaken unless new information is forthcoming.’

Jamie Cowen, who raised thousands of 
pounds for Mr Rossli with an internet campaign, said the student remains
in Britain and is ‘keeping his head down’.

Kafunda, who is a trainee youth worker, served six months in prison for robbing the same victim twice in one day in 2005.

Studies have shown that most of those jailed for their part in last summer’s riots have already been released. Many have been freed little more than ten months after the rioting and in some cases before the halfway point of their sentences.

One academic critic said most of the August 2011 rioters were released in time to be on the streets for any potential repeat of the trouble this year.

In June, only 692 people remained in jail for their part in the mayhem, or were on remand awaiting trial for serious crimes. A further 710 had served their jail term and been released.

Violence flared in Tottenham, North London, on August 6 last year after a protest over the fatal police shooting of local man Mark Duggan.

The trouble spread to Birmingham, Manchester and Nottingham, with shops looted and buildings torched.

An official inquiry into the five days of violence, which cost the country at least £500million, concluded that the shameful scenes were motivated by greed.

A panel set up by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg criticised the police for not getting a grip on the violence, but said the rioters’ main objectives were getting their hands on ‘luxury branded goods’ which ‘confer instant status’.

A criminal is typically released after half the sentence has been served – but if the treatment of rioters in prison had been in keeping with the tough policies the courts took when sentencing them, participants in the August disturbances would have been held for longer.

Ministry of Justice figures show that the average sentence for the 1,029 rioters jailed by the Crown Courts was 19.4 months.

Such offenders would normally expect to serve nearly ten months in jail before being freed. But it is believed there are still criminal cases involving offences connected to last year's riots have yet to be completed.
