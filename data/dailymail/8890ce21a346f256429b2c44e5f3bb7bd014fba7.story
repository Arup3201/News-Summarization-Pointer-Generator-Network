Attempting to tame one of the largest and most fearsome lizards in the world is no easy feat.

But zoo keepers in San Diego have managed to do just that with the help of a GoPro camera to track the progress a 14-year-old Komodo dragon.

The dragon, named Sunny, is a meat-eating, fast-moving predator that can kill large prey with his deadly venom and razor-sharp teeth.

Fearsome: Attempting to tame one of the largest lizards in the world is no easy feat. But zoo keepers in San Diego have managed to do just that with the help of a GoPro camera to track the progress of Sunny (pictured)

The 9ft (2.7 metre) creature has been taught to walk towards a series of yellow targets, getting a treat if he manages to complete the task successfully.

Despite its terrifying reputation, this Komodo dragon often responds to its keepers call by waddling towards the targets. 

As Komodo dragons spend most of their time resting in the sun, the training provides much-needed exercise for Sunny throughout the day.

And once he masters the trick, keepers can ask Sunny to move into a different area of the exhibit.

Komodo dragons, the world's largest lizards, are found on the Indonesian island of Komodo.

They have a stocky body, with bulky legs, scaly skin for camouflage and a long powerful tail. 

Males can measure up to 10ft (3m) in length and weight 176lbs (80kg).

They smell prey from a mile away and eat wild buffalo, pigs deer, snakes and fish.

There are 6,000 Komodo dragons in existence and only about 350 breeding females 

They eat mainly meat and can consume up to 80 per cent of its body weight at one time.

A Komodo dragon has about 60 sharp teeth to cut and tear flesh and can run as fast as humans.

The training is also helpful if medical attention is needed, as Sunny could voluntarily move without the need for sedation.

Footage from the GoPro camera is currently being used to review the sessions and give an insight into how Sunny sees his training.

Komodo dragons are the largest living lizards in the world. 

They are a type of monitor lizard, an ancient reptile species with ancestors that date back more than 100 million years.

Komodo dragons can grow up to 10ft (3 metres) long and weigh up to 176lbs (80kg).

The species has been labelled as ‘vulnerable’ by conservationists. 

There are currently around 6,000 Komodo dragons left in existence and only about 350 breeding females.
