Fox 2 News has reported Mike Reda allegedly shot dead two women at Detroit's Pablo Davis Elder Living Center who were reportedly friends with his ex-girlfriend

A 65-year-old man allegedly shot dead two elderly women with an assault rifle at his nursing home on Sunday in the belief they convinced his ex-girlfriend to dump him.

Fox 2 News reported Mike Reda grabbed an AK-47 from his room at Detroit's Pablo Davis Elder Living Center after having a fight with his girlfriend earlier in the day.

Reda allegedly hunted down two of his former flame's friends in the center before shooting them dead about 5.45pm.

Police said he shot a 54-year-old woman once as she sat outside the apartment building. She died in hospital.

The gunman then allegedly shot a 65-year-old woman multiple times inside her apartment. She died at the scene.

His ex-girlfriend was allegedly unharmed, but witnesses said she was at the scene.

Meanwhile, local resident Paul Frantangelo claimed he was sitting outside the West Vernor Highway apartment complex with the 54-year-old victim when the gunman allegedly confronted him.

'He told me to get on the ground and start praying,' Frantangelo told Fox 2. 'He let off a round and he shot my friend in the head. My ears were starting to ring.'

Frantangelo told Detroit News he was lucky he was spared.

'I didn’t see the rifle until he got right on top of us,' Fratangelo said.

'I said, ‘Oh my God. ...’ He said, ‘Get on the ground and start praying'. It was the grace of God that he didn’t shoot me. I really thought he was going to shoot me. I thought it was was over. Instead, he shot both my friends.'

The incident happened at the Pablo Davis Elder Living Center in Detroit on October 20

Victims: A 54-year-old woman died in hospital after being shot once, and 65-year-old woman died at the scene after being shot multiple times

Fratangelo said, after the 
confrontation, he ran to the first victim’s apartment to tell her son to
call police.

Detroit Police Chief James Craig told Fox 2 News officers detained the suspect soon after arriving on scene.

Detroit News reported residents of the 80-unit complex were evacuated onto department buses while police, accompanied by U.S. Border Patrol, swept the building for other victims.

Witnesses claimed the suspect had been drinking throughout the day and that he was a 'ticking time bomb'.

'The girl he broke up with said some trouble was going to happen,' Frantangelo told Fox 2.

'We all took it as sure we'll be careful. She said he's going to shoot somebody and we didn't take it for what it was said and it happened.'

The identities of the two victims and the gunman's girlfriend have not been released.
