The woman who was jailed for planting a severed human finger in a bowl of chili in an attempt to extort money from Wendy's has been accused of lying again.

Authorities alleged that infamous 'chili finger lady', Anna Ayala, 47, invented detailed reports of two men who 'shot' her 26-year-old son outside their home in San Jose, California.

Officers believe that Guadalupe 'Junior' Reyes, who has a previous burglary conviction and is not allowed to own a gun, shot himself, and his mother backed up the false story.

After the pair got their tales mixed up, police arrested them both on Thursday.

They face up to four years in prison if convicted.

Ayala is accused of being an 
accessory to a felony and filing a false police report, while Reyes 
faces charges related to being felon in possession of a firearm and 
ammunition.Â 

The mother, who has a long history of filing lawsuits, was released from prison after serving four years for the gruesome Wendy's chili finger case in 2005.

The bizarre scam gathered 
worldwide attention after Ayala dropped the 1 1/2 inch section of ring 
finger in her bowl of fast-food chili.

Bizarre hoax: Anna Ayala and her husband, Jaime Plascencia, were jailed in 2005 after cooking up a scheme to plant a severed finger in a bowl of Wendy's chili to extort money from the fast food chain

It was revealed Ayala's husband, Jaime Plascencia, had bought the digit for $100 from a co-worker who lost it in an accident. He then took it home where Ayala cooked it before depositing it in her meal on March 24, 2005.

Wendy's claimed they lost $21 million in business because of the bogus allegations.

Now police accuse Ayala of dreaming up another tall tale to protect her son.

When officers found Junior Reyes suffering from a gunshot wound to 
his ankle outside the family home he told them that he had
 been attacked by a pair of men for 'for no rhyme or reason.'

According to the Mercury News, Ayala is charged with using her vivid imagination to back up his claims and she now faces more time in prison.

The mom said one of the attackers 
wore a black Oakland A's cap and Air Jordan sneakers, while his 
accomplice was a big man with a goatee and abnormally large ears who 
rode a black bicycle.

Ayala even gave a name for the 
supposed attacker. But when authorities found a match for the supposed 
suspect, they quickly ruled the man out of the accusations.

'I don't know if it was someone she 
knew who she described or how she came up with the description,' said 
Santa Clara County prosecutor Bret Wasley.

When officers went back to question 
mother and son, Wasley said that 'She backed off from her statements' 
while 'Junior changed his story into something unbelievable about him 
chasing after a dog.'

On her Facebook page 'about' section Ayala describes herself as 'Crazzzzzyyyyy and a very good chili cook... (finger lady )'

San Jose police Detective Nathaniel Braxton then confronted Reyes with the theory that the pair had made up the whole story as he wasn't supposed to even own a gun.

'I told Reyes that shooting yourself in the foot is not a crime, it's an accident, but making a false report is a crime,' reports the Mercury News.

'Yea,' said Reyes, according to the report. 'I shot myself.'

But when Braxton asked his mother about the new information she told him: 'I don't know nothing.'

Braxton said that he 'reminded Ayala that she went to prison for doing the same thing before' and asked her where the gun was.

She replied 'There's no gun no more, 
it's done, thrown away' before telling police she had returned the 
firearm to an unidentified friend.

'Ayala's statement confirms Reyes shot himself and she admitted to getting rid of the evidence,' reads the report.

Both are being held on $21,000 bail each and are scheduled to appear in court on Friday. Ayala now faces a maximum of another four years in jail while Reyes could be convicted to up to four years and eight months.

According to the detective's report, 'Ayala's final statement was, 'I'm not going back to prison for something that has nothing to do with me."'

Ayala appeared contrite after her release from prison, telling CBS that she had faced ridicule in jail for her part in the scam and that 'I learned my lesson and I just want to move on with my life.'

On Facebook, Ayala's 'favorite quote' is:
 What happend (all sic) in 2005 was the biges badest ? That happend in 
my life ....Im sorry for all the dameges i was in ..........i did the 
time and its in the past...'

The 'chili finger lady' was convicted in 2005 and released for good behavior in 2009

Also on Facebook, Ayala's 'about' section reads: 'Crazzzzzyyyyy and a very good chili cook ... (finger lady ) ...'

In 2005, the Associated Press revealed that even before the chili finger episode, Ayala had been involved in at least half a dozen legal battles in the San Francisco Bay area.

She brought a suit against an ex-boss in 1998 for sexual harassment and sued an auto dealership in 2000, alleging the wheel fell off her car. That suit was dismissed after Ayala fired her lawyer, who said she had threatened him.

The case against her former employer was settled in arbitration in June 2002, but it was not known whether she received any money.

Ayala acknowledged, however, that her family received a settlement for their medical expenses about a year ago after reporting that her daughter, Genesis, got sick from food at an El Pollo Loco restaurant in Las Vegas. She declined to provide any further details.
