Freezing rain and sleet made for a sloppy Christmas morning trek in parts of the nation's midsection on Tuesday, while residents along the Gulf Coast braced for thunderstorms, high winds and the possibility of tornadoes.

Winds toppled a tree onto a pickup truck in the area of Houston, Texas, killing the driver.

The Harris County Sheriff's office said a 25-year-old man has died after strong storms that moved through the Houston area on Christmas Day knocked a tree onto his Ford F-150 pickup truck.

Deputy Thomas Gilliland says the incident occurred at about 9.40am local time in northwest Harris County.

According to official, the victim, 
whose identity has not been released, was pronounced dead at the scene 
by emergency responders.

Meanwhile, icy roads already were 
blamed for a 21-vehicle pileup in Oklahoma, where authorities warned 
would-be travelers to stay home.

Fog blanketed highways, including arteries in the Atlanta area where motorists slowed as a precaution.

A blizzard watch was posted for parts 
of Indiana and western Kentucky for storms expected to unfold Tuesday 
amid predictions of up to 4 to 7 inches of snow in coming hours.

Much of Oklahoma and Arkansas braced 
under a winter storm warning of an early mix of rain and sleet forecast 
to eventually turn to snow.

Some mountainous areas of Arkansas' 
Ozark Mountains could get up to 10 inches of snow amid warnings travel 
could become 'very hazardous or impossible' in the northern tier of the 
state from near whiteout conditions, the National Weather Service said.

Early Tuesday, the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety said some bridges and overpasses were already becoming slick.

The Oklahoma Highway Patrol cited freezing rain as the likely cause of the crash that took place at around 2.50am on Tuesday.

Miraculous: 12 people were transported to local hospitals with injuries but none critical

At
least a dozen people were transported to local hospitals and treated 
for unspecified injuries, but authorities said that none of those were 
critical.

The crash took place on the Westbound 
side of Interstate 40 by the intersection of Interstate 35 and the 
roadway was closed for more than five hours while the cars were removed 
from the scene.

The highway reopened at around 8.15am as more people hit the road in time for Christmas travel.

Kathleen O'Shea with Oklahoma Gas and 
Electric said the utility was tracking the storm system to see where 
repair crews might be needed among nearly 800,000 customers in Oklahoma 
and western Arkansas.

Elsewhere, areas of east Texas and 
Louisiana braced for possible thunderstorms as forecasters eyed a swath 
of the Gulf Coast from east Texas to the Florida Panhandle for the 
threat of any tornadoes.

Storms expected during the day Tuesday
along the Gulf Coast could bring strong tornadoes or winds of more than
75 mph, heavy rain, quarter-sized hail and dangerous lightning in 
Louisiana and Mississippi, the weather service said.

'Please plan now for how you will 
receive a severe weather warning, and know where you will go when it is 
issued. It only takes a few minutes, and it will help everyone have a 
safe Christmas,' Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant said.

Ten storm systems in the last 50 years
have spawned at least one Christmastime tornado with winds of 113 mph 
or more in the South, said Chris Vaccaro, a National Weather Service 
spokesman in Washington.

The most lethal were the storms of 
December 24-26, 1982, when 29 tornadoes in Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas,
Tennessee and Mississippi killed three people and injured 32; and those
of December 24-25, 1964, when two people were killed and about 30 
people injured by 14 tornadoes in seven states.

In Alabama, the director of the 
Emergency Management Agency, Art Faulkner, said he has briefed both 
local officials and Governor Robert Bentley on plans for dealing with a 
possible outbreak of storms.

Heavy: Up to six inches are predicted for Oklahoma, Arkansas and parts of Missouri during Christmas

No day is good for severe weather, but
Faulkner said Christmas adds extra challenges because people are 
visiting unfamiliar areas and often thinking more of snow than possible 
twisters.

'We are trying to get the word out 
through our media partners and through social media that people need to 
be prepared,' Faulkner said.

Mayor Rob Ortt of North Tonawanda, New 
York, just north of Buffalo, said of judging the city's holiday lighting
contest in the past week: 'There was something missing. I think this was the first year there was no snow, not even a dusting.'

'Everyone thinks of us as a place 
where snow is, and you relish it at Christmas time,' he said, adding, 
'When we have snow around St. Patrick's Day, that's when people get 
annoyed.'

During the night, flog blanketed 
highways at times in the Southeast, including arteries in Atlanta where 
motorists slowed as a precaution. Fog advisories were posted from 
Alabama through the Carolinas into southwestern Virginia.

Several communities in Louisiana went 
ahead with the annual Christmas Eve lighting more than 100 towering log 
teepees for annual bonfires to welcome Pere Noel along the Mississippi 
River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge.

That decision came after fire chiefs 
and local officials decided to go ahead with the tradition after an 
afternoon conference call with the National Weather Service.

In California, after a brief reprieve 
across the northern half of the state on Monday, wet weather was 
expected to make another appearance on Christmas Day. Flooding and 
snarled holiday traffic were expected in Southern California.
