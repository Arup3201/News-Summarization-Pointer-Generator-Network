Heavy metal musician Steve Harris is selling his plush 11-bed mansion - which comes complete with a full-sized football pitch, its own pub and an ornate swimming pool.

The Iron Maiden bass guitarist, who has owned Sheering Hall - set in nine acres of grounds in Sheering, Essex - since the 1980s, has put it on the market for £4.95m.

The 58-year-old, considered one of the best heavy metal bassists in the world and who was scouted by West Ham when he was a youngster, is a keen footballer and even has his own team, the Maidonians.

The £5million 11-bedroom mansion has parts which date back to the 14th century and sits on nine acres of land in Sheering in Essex

Iron Maiden bassist Steve Harris has reduced the price of his mansion by some £2 million to secure a buyer for the luxury property 

The house is ideal for anyone who is sporting mad as among its many features is a full size football field on the nine acres of land

The property is being sold by Iron Maiden bass guitarist Steve Harris, pictured, who is a serious West Ham fan

The Grade II-listed house has its own recording studio, tennis court, arcade area and gym as well as a 'pub' called the Horse and Cart.

The pub, installed by the bassist, comes complete with ales on tap as well as a vast selection of spirits, pool table and bar stools.

Estate agents Dreampad boast that the plush home is a 'substantial Grade II listed building' with 11,000 sq ft of floorspace and a full-sized 11-a-side football pitch - with home and away dressing rooms - in its grounds.

It states: 'There has been a house on the site since the Domesday Book and parts of the house date back to 1427.

'Nestled amid rolling farmland this nine acre estate is approached by a pretty private lane.

'The property boasts a wealth of period wood panelling and exposed original beams and flooring, various outbuildings to include a 3 bed coach house and 2 bed apartment and a wealth of leisure facilities, including a heated indoor swimming pool, floodlit tennis court and 11-a-side football pitch, with home and away dressing rooms.

For those who do not fancy the beautiful game, the property also features a flood-lit tennis court in case of a fifth set tie-break 

Unsurprisingly for an 11-bed mansion, the kitchen features acres of space for food preparation with an Aga and marble counter tops

There are solid oak beams throughout the £5 million property as well as wood-paneled walls and several reception rooms for entertaining

The blurb states the the pub even has a range of ales on tap, adding: 'Through a further hallway is access to your own private and fully equipped pub the 'Horse and Cart' complete with ale on tap.

'From the second hallway, further leisure amenities extend to an impressive media room again with a high ornately decorated ceiling, an office and editing studio.

'A second staircase leads to the bespoke indoor heated swimming pool with raised gym area, two separate recreational areas, changing room, separate kitchen and impressive split level galleried studio.

'From the entrance hall the main wood panelled staircase leads up to the first floor with the principal bedroom, dressing room & en suite bathroom, there are nine further bedrooms, a family bathroom and three shower rooms as well as staff accommodation consisting of bedroom, shower room, sitting room and kitchen which can also be accessed by the second staircase.'

If staying in is the new going out, this house allows you the best of both worlds with its own fully-stocked bar with pool table 

If the new owner spends too long in the kitchen or the bar they will be able to work off all of those calories the following day 

If pumping iron is too energetic, there is a rather ornate heated indoor swimming pool 

It adds: 'Approached via a pretty country lane and accessed via a private gated entrance into a sweeping gravel driveway with large parking area, Sheering Hall is a substantial Grade II listed house of historical importance with some 11,000 sq. ft. full of character and period features throughout.

'The property offers a fantastic variety of facilities for entertaining on a grand scale and has secondary glazing throughout.

'Surrounding the original medieval entrance hall with its exposed beams and open fireplace are the three main reception rooms.

'The sitting room and drawing room both benefit from fine detail and character with floor to ceiling oak panelled walls and high ceilings with gilded ornate cornicing.'

The property, which was first put on the market for £7m in 2012, even has a red BT phone box on its driveway.

Local David Harding said: 'Steve's not around here so much these days as he's always abroad - he's been here a long while and it will be sad to see him finally go.

'Whoever buys this place needs to enjoy football, tennis and swimming - and spending every night in their own pub. What more could anyone want?

'He had it on the market for £7m a couple of years ago, but obviously wants rid of it and has put the price down a couple of million. I can't afford it though, sadly.'

The bedrooms are suitably ornate with four-poster beds and even a fire place in the corner for that added romantic touch

The site where the Grade-II listed building was built was first mentioned in the Doomsday book although the oldest parts date to 1427

The house is close to Stansted Airport. It is also beside the M11 motorway and is only about an hour's journey from London by train
