Authorities may never piece together a full picture of the last hours of beautiful and happy Utah family of five all found dead in their home, a family spokesman said Tuesday.

The Stracks of Springfield--Benjamin and Kristi Strack, 37 and 36; with children Benson, 14; Zion, 11; and 12-year-old Emery--were all found by an older son and grandparent in the parents' room on Saturday.

They showed no signs of physical struggle, no wounds were found and a test for carbon monoxide in the home came back negative.

'We understand that those answers will take time, and that it is likely we will never know everything in perfect detail,' said Bob McGee.

The statement from McGee, uncle to the Strack children including the surviving son Janson, 18, was the first from the family since their loved ones' perplexing deaths.

'We are shocked and heartbroken by the sudden loss of so many members of our family,' Bob McGee said, reports Deseret. 'Events like this are difficult to understand, and even harder to come to terms with. And no words can adequately describe our feelings of grief and sorrow.'

Even Springville Police Lieutenant Dave Caron, meanwhile, appeared daunted by the initial lack of a cause of death.

'I didn't get into law enforcement to not have answers. I got into law enforcement to have answers. Unfortunately, this is one of those cases where we just don't have them. I wish we did,' he told reporters.

Even as the mystery goes unsolved, the Strack's community has started down the daunting path to healing.

A GoFundMe page has been created to help surviving family with 'overwhelming' funeral costs ahead.

The page devotes a few lines in remembrance of each family member, like father Benjamin. 'His heart was too big for this world and the love everyone felt when near him will not be forgotten,' it reads.

Not so long ago: Investigators have yet to lay down publicly a definite timeline of the family's deaths. Photos from their past show a family that appeared to be nothing but happy to have each other

The mom Kristi, the writer says, was 'charismatic, kind and loyal.' Her only daughter, Emery, loved animals.

Fourteen-year-old Benson loved to draw dragons and practice karate. His younger brother Zion, the youngest, 'brought everyone he came across happiness and joy.'

In spite of the roadblocks, police are still investigating what caused the deaths after preliminary autopsy results ruled out any sort of violent  foul play.

On Monday, the first heart-wrenching photos emerged of the handsome family. And the Stracks are exactly how surviving family members remember them--always smiling.

Preliminary autopsy results have ruled out any sort of violent assault or foul play.

'The Medical Examiner has indicated that the next step is to continue the investigation through analysis of blood samples to determine what may have caused the deaths,' the Springville DPS said in a statement.

'Preliminary autopsy results for the family of five who were found dead in their home have ruled out any sort of violent assault,' Springville police said in a statement. 

Police Lt. Dave Caron said the cause of death has not been determined, and will not be until an analysis of blood samples is concluded. 

The medical examiner's office provided no time frame for the release of results of laboratory testing.

The bodies were found shortly before 8 p.m. in the parents' bedroom by their 18-year-old  son Janson.

Their son returned home and knew something was wrong because of how quiet the house was, said Springville Police Chief J. Scott Finlayson, reported Deseret News.

He then went to his grandparents' home nearby to question their whereabouts, and returned with his grandmother to find the bodies.

Caron said someone either saw or talked to the family Saturday morning, but he was unsure about the last person to make contact with them.

Emery, 12, was found alongside her brothers and parents. The bodies were found shortly before 8 p.m. in the parents' bedroom

While a test of air in the house by firefighters did not find any carbon monoxide, investigators have not ruled that out as the cause of death.

The front door of the house was open and the back door was cracked open before firefighters arrived, Caron said, and the gas could have ventilated before the test. 

The family's pets were all fine.

Asked whether foul play has been ruled out, Caron said, 'I don't rule out anything ... We haven't ruled out anything except there was no violent trauma. We're going to look at everything.

'I do know when I was in there (house) I didn't see anything that would suggest a struggle ... I saw nothing like that,' he added. 

A Facebook tribute page has been set up to remember the family.

One user wrote: 'I feel a part of me has been lost. My brother Ben was my best friend.

'We did everything together. He always made me happy when he was around. Emery, Benson and Zion it seems like yesterday I was helping them with home work and taking them camping. I remember Benson caught his first fish with us on the trip.'

Another user wrote: ' Ben is one of my best friends. He was always like a brother to me as we grew up. I will miss him so much. 

'His kids had the biggest smiles every time I seen them.'  

On the tribute page another user wrote: ' I sat in a couple parent teacher conferences with both Ben and Kristi. 

They were always so thrilled to talk with me about Zion, they were truly proud parents. 

'I had the privilege to have their sweet, smiling, energetic, big brown eyed Zion in my second grade classroom. The happiness and energy he brought to school with him every day was infectious.'
