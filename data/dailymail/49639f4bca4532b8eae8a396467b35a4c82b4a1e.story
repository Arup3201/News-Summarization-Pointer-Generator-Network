Energy Secretary Ed Davey unveiled a package of reforms in the energy market

Energy bosses will face jail under plans to make the fixing of household fuel bills a crime.

Ed Davey, the Energy Secretary, yesterday said specific criminal penalties would apply to ‘manipulation of the energy markets’.

Modelled on those for the financial markets, where the maximum prison sentence for insider dealing is seven years, the details will be unveiled next year after a consultation.

Officials said they would apply to firms that artificially inflate prices to a level not justified by market forces or give inaccurate information about generating capacity or wholesale prices.

MPs claimed yesterday that the Big Six energy firms appear to operate as a ‘cartel’.

This prompted a furious response from nPower chief executive Paul Massara who tweeted: ‘Lots of wild talk about cartels but no evidence and the facts don’t support. Where is the evidence? Put up or shut up.’

Npower announced this month it would be putting up prices by 10.4 per cent for its 3.1million customers from December 1.

It was the third of the Big Six to announce huge rises this winter – although regulator Ofgem says wholesale prices have only risen by 1.7 per cent in the last 12 months.

Under Mr Davey’s plans, energy firms would be forced to ‘open up their books’ so regulators can see the costs and profits of every arm of their business.

He also pledged to reduce red tape to enable households to switch between energy firms within 24 hours. Currently it can take five weeks.

A look at current deals in the marketplace shows families can save up to £376 a year by switching from the most expensive variable tariffs.

Energy prices have dominated the agenda in recent weeks as the average dual fuel bill reaches £1,400 a year and Labour promises to freeze prices for 20 months if it wins the next election.

The price hikes will add £50 to every family's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than £100

Ministers say there must be more 
transparency about how wholesale prices feed through to bills, and have 
promised an annual ‘competition test’ by regulators.

'The energy market needs to change to put consumers in control'

But
analysts expressed doubts about it, saying the energy market has been 
investigated several times over the past decade and no wrongdoing has 
been found.

Ofgem’s latest 
Retail Market Review in 2011 found no evidence of a cartel, but ordered 
firms to slash the number of tariffs they offer.

The
regulator has powers to fine a company 10 per cent of turnover and has 
imposed fines and redress worth £70million since 2010.

Mr Davey said: ‘The energy market needs to change to put consumers in control.

Slump: Just 341,000 people changed gas and electricity supplier in June this year, less than half of the numbers who switched in summer 2011

'That
means making it easy for people to change supplier to save money, it 
means regular market assessments to check their behaviour, and it means 
tougher penalties for market manipulation and putting an end to opaque 
finances.

‘Energy companies 
need to know that any wrongdoing will be uncovered and dealt with.’ Tory
and Labour MPs claimed the Big Six operate as a ‘cartel’.

Labour’s
Ian Lavery said there was evidence for a ‘hidden, protected, secret 
sort of cartel trading scheme’ whereby energy companies trade with each 
other at above the wholesale price before passing the increases on to 
consumers.

He was told Labour should hand over any evidence it has about wrongdoing.

David
Cameron promised last week to ‘roll back green levies’ which account 
for £112 of the average energy bill, and are set to reach £286 by 2020.
