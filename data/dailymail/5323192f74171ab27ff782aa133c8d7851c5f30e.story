Newcastle head coach John Carver insists he is relaxed about three of his players attending the BRIT Awards after-show party.

Tim Krul, Jack Colback and Steven Taylor were pictured in London in the early hours of Thursday morning having been at the late-night bash in Covent Garden, along with the likes of Ant n Dec, Ed Sheeran and Rita Ora.

Goalkeeper Krul and midfielder Colback, however, were back on Tyneside later in the day. Taylor, meanwhile, is out injured with a ruptured Achilles.

But Carver says there will be no disciplinary action brought against the trio.

‘Two of the three (Taylor and the suspended Colback) are not involved this weekend. The third player was there with his girlfriend,’ said Carver.

‘I cannot run a 24-hour surveillance over these players. I have got to trust them and I always trust my players. 

'The pleasing thing is Tim and Jack have come in this morning (Thursday) and have trained exceptionally well. So I don’t have a problem with that. They were in good shape.’
