Do you struggle to keep your toes cosy in wintery weather?

Now there’s an inconspicuous interactive insole that heats your feet and can be controlled using a smartphone app.

Digitsole devices slip inside shoes and will allow wears to adjust the temperature of the insoles at the touch of a button, as well as count steps and calories burned, when they go on sale.

Charge the insoles via the built-in USB port.

Switch the on/off button on the back of the insole, launch the app and connect it to your smartphone using Bluetooth.

Select the warmth function on the app and adjust the temperature of each insole by sliding the bar up and down.

You can track how many steps you take during the day as well as the altitude.

The app also counts how many calories have been burned.

The company, based in Nancy, France, claims its lightweight insole is the first wholly connected design of its type and fits into most types of shoes.

The heating element of the insole is a secret, but the company told MailOnline that it's located in the toe and that the specially-engineered fabric spreads the heat throughout the sole.

Digitsoles are made from a lightweight material called Neotech. They will be charged using a USB port and will connect to an Android and iOS app via Bluetooth 4.0.

Once connected, a user will be able to access the ‘warm up function’ on the app. There, they will adjust the temperature of each insole separately by sliding a bar on the screen up and down.

Not so shocking: The insoles have a ‘shock heel system’ (pictured) to help with general posture and foot health, the company claims. They are made from a lightweight material called Neotech

‘This unique independent adjustment allows you to get the perfect temperature setting for each of your feet,’ the company says on its Kickstarter page, where it is looking for funds to put the insoles into production. 

Once the temperature of an insole drops below the chosen setting, a built-in thermostat adjusts it to maintain the temperature. 

The insoles have sensors inside to provide precise tracking, which their creators say are more accurate than exercise wristbands.

Users can enter their weight and height when they first log in to the app to keep track of how many calories they burn and how many steps they take while using Digitsoles.

The insoles have a ‘shock heel system’ to help with general posture and foot health, the company claims.

This consists of a cushion section placed at the back of the insole to soften shock and spread vibrations of the foot, and a ‘flex zone section’ at the front of the insole to encourage natural movement of feet and provide arch support. 

The insoles are available to pre-order on crowd funding website Kickstarter, from $99 (£60) and are expected to be shipped in December.

Multipurpose: Users can choose how warm to make their insoles using the 'warm the feet' function of the app (pictured left), track how many steps they have taken and metres walked (pictured centre) and document how many calories they have burned while wearing the insoles

Flexible: Digitsole has been designed to be thin, comfortable and easy to place in most shoe types so you only need one pair. 'The insoles can be used in just about any shoe...so you can enjoy warm feet whatever you’re doing,' the company said

Good to go: The insoles, which will be sold for $99 on Kickstarter, can be charged by using a built in USB-port
