We know how the Mayans built astonishing temples in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras - but now it's been suggested some fled their dissolving civilisation and may have even ended up in Atlanta.

Historian and author Richard Thornton believes a 1,100-year-old archaeological site shows that peasants fled Central America and ended up in the North Georgian mountains near Blairsville.

His astonishing theory is based on the discovery of 300 to 500 rock terraces and mounds on the side of Brasstown Bald mountain that date to 800AD - around the time the Mayans began to die out.

Georgia Mountain: The theory revolves around an area near Brasstown Bald mountain, pictured, potentially being the 'fabled city of Yupaha, which Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto failed to find in 1540'

But not everyone is impressed by Mr Thornton’s theory. He cited University of Georgia archaeology professor Mark Williams in an article in the Examiner, reported the Atlanta Journal Constitution.

‘I am the archaeologist Mark Williams mentioned in this article,’ Professor Williams said on Facebook. ‘This is total and complete bunk. There is no evidence of Maya in Georgia. Move along now.’

However Professor Williams’s comments on the Examiner article have themselves caused a backlash as other readers labelled his dismissive words as ‘pompous’, ‘arrogant’ and ‘disrespectful’.

The professor responded by telling the Atlanta Journal Constitution: ‘There’s a feeling that people are hiding the truth. Someone needed to stand up and say: “This is silly”.’

Mr Thornton’s blockbuster theory 
revolves around the area near Brasstown Bald potentially being the 
‘fabled city of Yupaha, which Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto failed 
to find in 1540’.

'It
is possibly the site of the fabled city of Yupaha, which Spanish 
explorer Hernando de Soto failed to find in 1540, and certainly one of 
the most important archaeological discoveries in recent times'

Richard Thornton

He described it as ‘certainly one of 
the most important archaeological discoveries in recent times’. 
Archaeologist Johannes Loubser excavated part of the site and wrote a 
report about it in 2010.

The remains were first found by retired engineer Carey Waldrip when he went walking in the area in the 1990s.

‘I
think that (Mr Thornton) selectively presents the evidence,’ Mr Loubser
told the Atlanta Journal Constitution. ‘But he’s a better marketer than
I and other archaeologists are.’

Mr
Loubser, who excavated a rock wall and small mound, added that claims 
like this must be backed up with ‘hard evidence’ because of the various 
conflicting opinions in the archaeological world.

Theory: The Mayans could have left Central America and ended up in the North Georgian mountains

Fascinating: The Mayans died out around 900AD for reasons still debated by scholars - although drought, overpopulation and war are the most popular theories (file picture)

The Mayans died out around 900AD for 
reasons still debated by scholars - although drought, overpopulation and
war are the most popular theories, reported the Atlanta Journal 
Constitution.

Mr Loubser believes the structures could 
have been built by the Cherokee Indians or an earlier tribe between 
800AD and 1100AD. He stopped digging because he realised the site could 
be a grave.

‘The sites are certainly those of Native Americans of prehistoric Georgia,’ Professor Williams told ABC News. ‘Wild theories are not new, but the web simply spreads them faster than ever.’

But Mr Thornton claimed early maps of the location named two villages ‘Itsate’, which was how Itza Mayans described themselves. The terrace structures and date helped him reach his conclusion.

The Mayans have been under intense scrutiny over the past few years as rumours abound about their mysterious 5,125-year calendar allegedly predicting the apocalypse on December 21 2012.

But various experts have spoken out over the last month, including Mexico's 'Grand Warlock' Antonio Vazquez, to say that the Mayan calendar instead will just reset and a new time-span will begin.
