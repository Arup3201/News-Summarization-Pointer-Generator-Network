A 99-year-old Battle of Britain veteran hit out at airport chiefs today after they banned him from a memorial ceremony for his hero brother who was killed in World War Two - because he hasn't got a passport.

Charles Crowther, of Laurencekirk, Aberdeenshire, was desperate to attend the unveiling of the memorial at Leeds Bradford International Airport (LBIA) in West Yorkshire but was told he would not be allowed through security.

Next week's service is to be held for those killed in 609 (West Riding) Squadron during the war, which includes Charles's brother William, whose Wellington Bomber was shot down by a German plane in 1942.

Charles Crowther, 99, cannot go to a WWII memorial ceremony in the departure lounge of Leeds Bradford International Airport (LBIA) to honour his hero brother William (black and white photo) because he hasn't got a passport or driving licence

Speaking from his home Mr Crowther, who served in the same squadron, admitted he was devastated that the airport couldn't make an exception for him and let him attend the service.

The former ground crew serviceman said: 'I can understand that there have to be safety checks but this might be the last time that I could go and commemorate my brother, so I'm upset I can't go.

'I'm 99 and so of course I'm not going to have a passport now or a driving licence.

'Unfortunately, this ceremony is taking place in a restricted part of the aerodrome - and I shan't be allowed in without these documents.

'It feels awful that I can't attend a service to my own brother.'

William, a flight engineer, died aged 30 when his Wellington Bomber was shot down on the way back from an air raid in Essen, Germany.

He and his flight crew were just about to reach the Norfolk coast when a German shell hit the fuselage of the plane and exploded over the North Sea.

Charles's son, Peter, 65, has pleaded 
with the authorities to let his father pay tribute at the unveiling of a
plaque on April 17 by the 609 Squadron Association.

The Battle of Britain was the German air force's attempt to gain air superiority over the RAF from July to September 1940.

It was one of the turning points of World War Two and prevented Germany from invading Britain.

The battle began in mid-July with Luftwaffe concentrating on attacking shipping in the 
English Channel and attacking coastal towns and defences.

From August 12, Hermann 
Goering, one of the leaders of the Nazi regime, shifted his focus to the
destruction of the RAF, attacking airfields and radar bases. (Pictured above, RAF scrambling to their planes in 1940.)

Convinced that Fighter Command was 
now close to defeat, he also tried to force air battles between fighter 
planes to break British strength.

But Goering grew frustrated by 
the number of British planes still fighting off his 
attacks.

Luftwaffe switched tactics again and, on 
Hitler's orders, set about destroying London and other major cities.

Eleven days later, on what became 'Battle of Britain Day', the 
RAF decimated the huge incoming Luftwaffe formations in the skies above 
London and the south coast.

Peter, of Fettercairn, Aberdeenshire, said: 'I don't know what to do about it.

'I just couldn't understand why a 99-year-old man would be treated this way.

'We've got plenty of proof about his identity, just not the two documents that are required and it seems mad that an exception couldn't have been made.

'The chairman of the 609 Squadron Association actually said I could get a passport for my father as they can be issued for free to anyone born before 1928.

'But when I said that he had lost his previous one, which he hadn't seen for 40 years, I was told that would take about six or seven weeks to sort out the paperwork which was far too long a process.

'It's just a bit of nonsense I think.'

A spokeswoman for LBIA said that two ceremonies were taking place, but the first would be in the departure lounge which would require passport or driving licence identification for visitors to attend.

She said: 'There are two plaques being unveiled at the airport on April 17 both commemorating the 609 (West Riding) Squadron.

'At 10am, a ceremony to reintroduce the restored plaque over a prayer of dedication in its new location will be held for original contributors and their immediate family.

'This is to take place airside within the departure lounge.

'A visitor pass needs to be issued for all attendees visiting the restricted areas and there are strict guidelines that the airport must comply with governing the issue of visitor passes - one element is an official form of identification.

'Both LBIA and the 609 Squadron Association have tried to assist the family in obtaining the required documents.

'At 11am on the same day, a second plaque will also be unveiled in the airport's main entrance landside.

'This brand new plaque not only commemorates the original 609 Squadron but also the squadron which re-formed in 1999 and still serves today.

'The family are very welcome to attend this event and have previously been encouraged to do so.'

Charles's set of medals includes the Air Efficiency Award, 1939-1945 Star, Italy Star, Defence Medal and 1939-1945 Campaign Medal
