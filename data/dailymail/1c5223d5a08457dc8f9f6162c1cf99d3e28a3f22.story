A teen worker at Walmart is accused of using deodorant before returning it to the store's shelves.

Chandler Roberts, 18, was caught on camera, twice 'selecting a stick of Old Spice deodorant,' which he proceeded to apply while in the bedding department.

He then returned the toiletry item to the shelf of the South Carolina store.

He is now being investigated after admitting he stole more than $1,800 in merchandise, reports the Smoking Gun.

Store security noticed him taking taking milk and Oreos to the staff break room which he had not paid for and began observing him, according to a police report.

When confronted about his actions, Roberts 'admitted to stealing several items,' but said he couldn't recall how much they were worth

When confronted about his actions, Roberts 'admitted to stealing several items,' but said he couldn't recall how much they were worth.

He offered to return some of them and later 'returned numerous stolen items to asset protection' according to the report.

Walmart calculated that the goods were worth $1,823.25.

Cops did not address whether the used deodorant ended up being purchased by a customer.

Police are continuing to investigate the Walmart thefts.
