Michael Carrick admitted that Manchester United were simply not good enough in the wake of their goalless draw against Cambridge United in the FA Cup fourth round.

The midfielder was left frustrated after his side were held by an impressive performance from their League Two opposition on Friday night.

'We came here to win and get in the next round,' said Carrick. 'The first-half was very scrappy, but fair play to Cambridge for defending the box well and making it difficult for us. We weren't at our best.

'It's frustrating because we want to be through (to the fifth round) but at the same time we're still in and we've got the replay now.

'It's the FA Cup isn't it. We've seen strange things happen in this competition before.' 

Speaking after the match, Carrick also challenged his attacking team-mates to take their opportunities when presented with them.

He added: 'We came here hoping to win the game, we knew it wasn't going to be easy. 

'You can take the difference between the two clubs in the league pyramid but that goes out the window. We've had the better chances, and credit to them for the way we defended.

'People will ask questions of us not scoring, but we'll accept the replay and move on. We are on a decent run but we want to be winning matches. We have the firepower, we're creating chances, but we just didn't take them.'
