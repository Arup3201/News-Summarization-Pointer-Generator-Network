Soldiers could soon be equipped with Iron Man-style helmets that help them pinpoint targets quickly and easily on the battlefield.

The Q-Warrior helmet-mounted display, designed by defence contractor BAE Systems, uses similar technology to that used by jet pilots in fighter planes and mimics the display used in the Iron Man films. 

It’s currently undergoing tests in the U.S., but military researchers have said the tech is ‘already exceeding expectations.'

The helmet-mounted display is fitted with an optical screen that sits in front of the soldier's left eye.

This display creates 3D images, that are positioned in such a way that they appear to sit in the real world.

Images from CCTV cameras and other surveillance sensors, as well as data from nearby vehicles, is beamed directly onto the display.  

Additionally, the display will highlight compass directions and targets, as well as colleagues, to prevent friendly fire attacks. 

The battery-powered HUD is fitted with an infrared camera, a video recorder and GPS unit.

A head-up display, or HUD, is a transparent display that presents data within the wearer’s line of sight.

The technology was originally developed for military pilots but is now used in commercial planes, gaming, and cars.

For example, the Garmin HUD beams directions onto a person’s windscreen and can track their eye movements to make sure the driver spends minimal time looking away from the road.

Created by engineers at BAE Systems' Electronic Systems business in Kent, it is hoped the Q-Warrior technology will give soldiers and members of the special forces more real-time visual data than ever before.

The Q-Warrior’s high-resolution, see-through display allows waypoints, points of interest, and targets to be displayed over what a soldier can see in front of them.

The principle behind the Q-Warrior technology is similar to what Robert Downey Jr, pictured, used in the film Iron Man. The Q-Warrior display creates 3D holographic images, uses images and data from surveillance sensors and highlights compass directions, as well as colleagues to prevent friendly fire attacks

It is expected to be used by section commanders, but could one day become a standard piece of kit for soldiers.

Paul Wright, Soldier Systems’ Business Development Lead at BAE Systems’ Electronic Systems in Rochester, said: ‘Q-Warrior increases the user’s situational awareness by providing the potential to display ‘eyes-out’ information to the user, including textual information, warnings and threats.

'Other key features include enhanced night vision, waypoints and routing information, and the ability to track both personnel and assets.

'The biggest demand, in the short term at least, will be in roles where the early adoption of situational awareness technology offers a defined advantage.

'This is likely to be within non-traditional military units with reconnaissance roles, such as Forward Air Controllers/Joint Tactical Aircraft Controllers (JTACS) or with special forces during counter terrorist tasks.

'The next level of adoption could be light role troops such as airborne forces or marines, where technical systems and aggression help to overcome their lighter equipment.'

Many have compared the new helmets to the high-tech equipment used in films such as Iron Man.

Wright added: ‘Iron Man presented an unachievable, invincible warrior capability but modern technology such as Q-Warrior is starting to bring some of that capability to the next generation of specialist soldiers.’

A head-up display, or HUD, is a transparent display that presents data within the wearer's line of sight. The technology was originally developed for military pilots, seen here on the co-pilot display of a C-130J Super Hercules plane, but is now used in commercial planes, cars, and gaming
