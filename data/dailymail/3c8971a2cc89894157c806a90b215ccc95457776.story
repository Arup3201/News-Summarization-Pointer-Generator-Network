Thousands of Syrian refugees have crossed the border into Turkey to avoid the threat of ISIS occupation. 

Many of those forced to flee were ethnic Kurds who face being raped and murdered at the hands of the brutal terrorist organisation. 

The refugees waited for several days in Raqqa city the Tal Abyad region of Syria while Turkish authorities considered their fate. The border was opened around Friday lunchtime allowing thousands of refugees to leave the warzone.

Thousands of ethnic Kurds fled the approach of ISIS terrorists and massed on the border with Turkey hoping to cross the frontier to safety at about midday on Friday

The refugees waited for several days in Raqqa city the Tal Abyad region of Syria while Turkish authorities considered their fate as thousands fled from the clashes

The desperate people were held at the frontier for several hours as Turkish officials decided upon whether they should open the border and allow the refugees to pass

Men women and children took whatever belongings they could carry and fled from the heavily armed ISIS terrorists who were advancing with tanks and artillery 

Heavily armed ISIS terrorists, equipped with artillery and tanks have captured more than 20 villages in the Kurdish-controlled area of Kobani.  

Ibrahim Halil, a Syrian Kurd who fled across the border with 3,000 other refugees said: 'Our house was destroyed. We have no family no property left. We have nothing now. Everything is gone.'

Many of those who crossed the border had been waiting for 24 hours after Turkey, which is already home to nearly 850,000 registered Syrian refugees, refused to let them in on Thursday.

Turkey decided to permit them to enter the country after reports emerged that militants were closing in on their communities.

Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu said the priority is to help those in need on the Syrian side of the border, but 'if that's not possible then of course they will be given help (inside Turkey)'.

Earlier, a group of Kurds from Turkey staged a protest at the border, demanding that Kurds fleeing Kobani be allowed in. The security forces fired tear gas to disperse the group.

The battle over Kobani is part of a long-running fight between the Islamic State group and Syria's Kurds that has raged across several areas of northern Syria where large Kurdish populations reside. 

Families pleaded with border guards for any form of assistance as people looked distressed despite only being a few steps from safety

After an anxious wait, officials allowed the column of refugees to enter Turkish territory where a decision will be made about their long-term future 

Many of the women approaching the border were not accompanied by men, some of whom are believed to have joined the fight against ISIS 

Following a major offensive in Kurdish controlled Syria, ISIS has captured at least 20 villages, prompting the mass exodus towards the Turkish border 

Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu said he wanted to provide assistance on the Syrian side of the border but the ISIS offensive made him open the frontier 

US President Barack Obama and French President Francois Hollande are planning airstrikes against ISIS targets in Iraq, but no decision has been made on Syria yet

Without the threat of airstrikes, ISIS is able to move its heavy armour around Syria relatively freely but the West does not want to deal with embattled Bashar al-Assad

Some of the refugees were in a very poor physical condition after the walked though the strong sun towards the Turkish border and collapsed upon arrival
