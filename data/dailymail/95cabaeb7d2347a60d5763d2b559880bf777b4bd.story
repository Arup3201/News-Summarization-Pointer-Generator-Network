A romantic 76-year-old grandfather has written a heartfelt book of poems to his ailing wife to celebrate every year they have spent together.

Len Biddlecombe, of Shotley, Suffolk, has now had the book published - having penned a poem for each of the 48 years he has been with Barbara, 71.

Sadly she can no longer talk and struggles to walk after being struck down by Alzheimer’s disease – but Mr Biddlecombe still dedicates his life to being by her side at a nursing home in Ipswich.

He now spends his time comforting her and recalling their happy times together. He said he was proud to have the poems published as a book - which is appropriately named Life of Love.

Mr Biddlecombe added: ‘I wrote the earlier ones about her and as we had our family they came into it. Then as time went on they were more for her than about her.

‘It’s the complete kaleidoscope of our life, from when we first got together to today.’

The couple met in 1966 and have been married for 46 years after being set up by Mrs Biddlecombe’s father. They went on to have three children and three grandchildren.

He said: ‘It was love at first sight for me - Barbara was the most beautiful person I’d ever seen. I stopped writing after she went in the home. I did insist on writing a final poem to finish the book off.

‘But we had to draw a line under that part of our life. Barbara doesn’t quite comprehend any more.

‘But she does tend to smile. She liked 
the little picture of us on the back cover but she doesn’t understand 
the wording. Every story I’ve written I read to her before I even did 
anything with it.’

The couple married at Ipswich Register Office in 1968 and lived in Shotley all their married life apart from a short spell in nearby Holbrook.

Mr Biddlecombe worked as a self-employed taxi driver before retiring while his wife took care of the home and spent her time painting.

‘The best poem in the book is the one I wrote when our first child was born, one of life’s most precious moments,’ he added. ‘It describes the thrill of holding your baby for the first time, something that many people can relate to.’

It’s life’s most precious moment between a man and his wife,

When they are together and produce their first new life.

It often starts when he’s asleep at 3am or so,

She wakes her weary partner and says ‘It’s time to go.’

Her bag is packed and ready; they’ve rehearsed it all before.

There’s no need to panic, but he does that’s for sure!

A quick drive to the hospital, there won’t be long to wait,

If only he could keep awake it really would be great.

Everything is ready, no need to induce;

Contractions getting regular, she’s ready to produce.

Suffering hours of labour she screams out in pain,

‘I’ll never let you put me through all this again.’

You hold her hand so tightly but she grips you like a vice.

Caesarean is called for, Oh God it isn’t nice.

But now you hold your baby, you and proud mum there,

It is Life’s most precious moment, each of you can share.

Life of Love by Len Biddlecombe was published in paperback on May 27.

It is available on Amazon for £4.73, or for  £1.83 on Kindle

The time has come to draw a close to the poems I’ve written for you,

Our truly wonderful lifetime of love is very nearly through.

After I wrote the last one I found it hard to understand

My life received a nasty shock when fate called and took a hand.

You were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, a disease so cruel and sad

It drove a wedge between our love and all the fun we’d had.

Well over a thousand words I’ve penned especially for you,

I’d gladly write a thousand more if you’d understand a few

But your powers of observation and the precious gift of speech

Both have sadly left you and are now well out of reach.

You’re living in a silent world with normal feelings gone

And yet you’re never giving up, you just keep struggling on.

I see you every single day though you’re in full time care

I cry myself to sleep each night because you’re never there.

I’m not looking for your sympathy for me or for my wife

We’ve both been very lucky in a long and happy life,

Some people have no life at all or are cut down in their prime

Victims of an accident or a cruel and hideous crime

So when the curtain closes and the call comes from above

I pray we’ll be together to share another lifetime of true love.
