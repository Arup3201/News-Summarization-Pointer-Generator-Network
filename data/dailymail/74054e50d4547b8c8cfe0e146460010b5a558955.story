The property - Tarra - at 23 Lower Fort Street comes with a $1.7 million plus forecast and boasts impressive views of the Opera House.

They will go to auction on Thursday and, if sold, will follow a five-bedroom Colonial Regency style townhouse at 29 Lower Forte Street which sold for $2.56 million last month.

The sale was significantly larger than expected, with buyers given an estimate $1.5 million selling price earlier this month, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

Real estate agents Di Jones were unable to comment on the sale of the property, with the Government Property NSW placing a gag order on all agents involved.

This property at 86 Windmill Street will go to auction later this month

The sale is the second of 293 state-owned houses to go under the hammer in a government plan to relocate 600 public housing tenants.

Government Property NSW has now made $4.47 million from the project, and as well as Thursday's auctions two more houses at 86 Windmill Street and 30 Argyle Place will sell on September 25 and October 8.

Reserve price for either property are yet to be listed.

The government has justified the sell-off by promising that for every house sold in Millers Point, three houses could be built in more suburban Sydney areas, where there is a 58,000-strong waiting list.

But the mass relocation has been vastly unpopular with residents and the broader community alike.

Several protesters attended the auction for the Kent St property last week, despite being held in a secret location.

It's expected the impending sales will attract similar resistance.
