A mourner attacked six guests at a wake after attending a friend’s funeral, a court has heard.

Jacqueline Coltman, 42, left the dead woman’s sister with a broken shoulder and punched a child to the ground during a fight outside the Windsor Castle pub in Heavitree, Exeter, it was claimed.

The drunken brawl took place in December 2012 during a large party following the funeral of Selina Nicholas - a 49-year-old mother-of-seven who died after becoming addicted to a powerful legal high fifty times stronger than cannabis.

Two children and the sister of the dead woman were among the alleged victims of the assault, Exeter Crown Court was told.

Coltman, of Minchinghampton in 
Gloucestershire, denies causing grievous bodily harm to one guest, 
actual bodily harm to another and battery against three more.

The jury have been told she has already received a police caution for a sixth assault by battery after admitting pulling another mourner’s hair.

Mr David Bowen, prosecuting, said the wake followed the funeral of Selina Nicholas and the most seriously injured victim was the dead woman's sister, Chiquita Owen.

'The defendant went to the funeral wake at which she was drunk and there was pent-up feeling between her and some of the people at the gathering,' he said.

'As a result of that she attacked six of them. There were children there but it is fair to say that there was a great deal of drinking taking place among the adults and some of the witnesses and victims were drunk,' he added.

'The defendant became more and more unpleasant to a child who was at the wake and to the child’s mother. The child stood up for herself and was punched in the chest fell on the ground where she momentarily lost consciousness,' Mr Bowen went on to say.

The court was told that Chiquita Owen went outside the pub and saw the child on the floor.

She asked the defendant what was happening and in response Coltman struck her hard to the face, breaking her glasses, it was alleged.

'She grabbed her hair and she fell to the ground where she landed on top of her as a result of which she suffered a fractured collar bone and other injuries,' Mr Bowen said.

He added that Coltman went on to punch other mourners or grab them by the hair before going back into the pub where she hit another mourner.

The incident occurred at the funeral of Selina Nicholas, which took place one month after her death in November 2012.

Coltman was arrested following the drunken brawl during her friend's wake. She said she had only pulled one woman’s hair and not carried out any of the other alleged assaults.

The trial continues.
