Sandra Kelwick, of Duckmanton, Derbyshire, has to pay less than £7 a week to repay benefits she falsely claimed

A benefits cheat who swindled the state out of nearly £60,000 has been told by a judge she must repay the cash at a rate of less than £7 a week.

Sandra Kelwick, 50, would need to live to the age of 211 before her £13.70 fortnightly repayments cleared the £57,405 she stole over six years.

The mother-of-four, of Duckmanton, Derbyshire, was arrested following a tip-off and discovered to be living with a partner - despite claiming extra money available to single mothers.

Edna Leonard, prosecuting, told Derby Crown Court that Kelwick began claiming benefit in July 2000 when her partner left the home.

But in December 2012, civil servants were told another man had moved in during November 2007.

He gave her address to his bank in 2007 and his employers were told of his location in 2011. His car's insurance documents also carried the address.

'Surveillance was undertaken and they saw him coming and going from the address. She said she had been his girlfriend for seven years but they didn't live together,' said Miss Leonard.

Later Kelwick admitted he had moved in. When the offences ended, she had been wrongly paid £38,619 income support, £14,058 housing benefit and council tax benefit of £4,728.

The court heard Kelwick had discussed her benefits with her new partner and further claimed he had persuaded her to keep stealing the cash.

Miss Leonard said Kelwick had never been in trouble before.

The investigation into Sandra Kelwick's benefit fraud was launched after officials received a tip-off.

Judge Jonathan Gosling told her: 'You stole over a long period of time almost £10,000 a year. You have lost your good name.'

The judge said he noted Kelwick had been ill, pleaded guilty promptly and that the benefit claims were initially legitimate.

He added: 'I hope your health improves so you can go back to work.'

Kelwick was ordered her to have five days of 'employment training' to help her get a job.

Sandra Kelwick admitted four counts of failing to notify a change of circumstances and two of making false statements to get benefit

Sandra Kelwick was handed a three-month curfew as punishment for the offences, put on probation and given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for a year, when she appeared at Derby Crown Court

Judge Gosling estimated she could have legitimately received £8,000 benefits and added: 'It is likely to be significantly more.'

Kelwick admitted four counts of failing to notify a change of circumstances and two of making false statements to get benefit.

She was handed a three-month curfew as punishment for the offences, put on probation and given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for a year, when she appeared at Derby Crown Court.

Kelwick was ordered to repay the cash at £13.70 a fortnight. But her solicitor Joe Harvey said: 'She may be able to find employment to start to pay it back at a much more attractive rate'.
