West Ham striker Andy Carroll insists the belief is there in the squad that the club can qualify for Europe this season.

The Hammers' 3-0 home win over Hull on Sunday - courtesy of goals from Carroll, Morgan Amalfitano and Stewart Downing - took them up to seventh in the  Premier League table after a run of four winless matches had seen them drop off the pace.

Asked if West Ham were European contenders, Carroll told Sky Sports: 'There's a belief in the dressing room, I don't see why not. We haven't had a win in the last few games but we've had the performances that can take us up to the top.'

West Ham had struggled in the first half before turning the screw on Hull in the second.

Downing, who added West Ham's third after a peach of a through-ball from Alex Song, added: 'We just moved the ball quicker in the second half - in the first half we didn't do it quick enough and we made it easy for Hull who had a lot of men behind the ball.

'In the second half we were making a lot of good runs and getting men in the box, so it was a much better performance.'

The victory means West Ham climb above Liverpool into seventh in the table, four points off fourth place.

The Hammers were booed off by their own fans at half-time and manager Sam Allardyce admits he told his team to be more direct in the second period.

'All this tippy-tappy stuff - everybody keeps on going about the right way to play football - is all a load of b******s sometimes,' Allardyce said.

'Getting the ball into the opposition box as quickly as you can with quality is definitely sometimes the best way forward and that's what we did in the second half and that's why we won the game.'

Allardyce had no complaints with the crowd venting their frustration but believes Tuesday's penalty shoot-out win over Everton in the FA Cup may have had an effect on his players.

Sam Allardyce was pleased with how West Ham upped their performance in the second half 

'We weren't good (in the first half),' Allardyce said.

'When you've had an exciting game like Tuesday night, it was disappointing for the fans to see how poorly we played in the first half, they didn't expect it.

'I haven't seen us pass so poorly this entire season as we passed in the first half.

'That can only be a legacy of the efforts they put in on Tuesday night.'
