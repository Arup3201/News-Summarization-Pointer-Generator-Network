It was a simple case of pressing a button. But he probably wouldn’t be the first among us to be a little perplexed by a touchscreen. 

Pope Benedict XVI looked as though he was struggling to get to grips with his iPad as he posted his first Twitter update yesterday.

But after a little bit of not-so-divine intervention, the 85-year-old pontiff successfully hit send – and appeared rather delighted with the result.

First tweet: In perhaps the most drawn out Twitter launch ever, Pope Benedict XVI pushed the button on a tablet brought to him at the end of his general audience today

Question and answer session: The Pope seemed to answer his own question about being more 'prayerful'

He addressed his rather modern flock 
of more than one million followers with the words: ‘Dear friends, I am 
pleased to get in touch with you through Twitter. Thank you for your 
generous response. I bless all of you from my heart.’

Pope Benedict XVI posted the message at the end of 
his weekly general audience this morning.

As well as going out to his followers on Twitter, the 140-character message also flashed on the large screens in the 
modernist Pope Paul VI Hall where the audience was held.

At around the same time the message was sent, the account's followers surpassed the 1 million mark on the eight languages of the handle, adding some 11,000 followers in the last two hours alone. 

Today is the feast of the Madonna of Guadalupe and the 85-year-old pontiff has said he will respond to three messages sent to him from around the world using the hashtag #askpontifex, the Vatican said.

After his initial tweet, the Pope seemed to post a question - possibly one sent in to him - and an answer to it.

His tweets read: 'Any suggestions on 
how to be more prayerful when we are so busy with the demands of work, 
families and the world?

'Offer
everything you do to the Lord, ask his help in all the circumstances of
daily life and remember that he is always beside you'.

The first papal tweet has been the subject of intense curiosity for months.

Pope Benedict actually sent his very 
first tweet over a year ago, using a generic Vatican account to launch 
the Holy See's news information portal.

Is anything happening? The pontiff waits for confirmation that his first Twitter update has worked

Successful social networking: As the tweet is published, Pope Benedict XVI appears delighted

Someone in his name tweeted daily during Lent, part of the Vatican's efforts to increase the church presence in social media. 

A personal Twitter account has been the subject of speculation ever since the 
Vatican's senior communications official said in February the idea was 
gaining traction.

Vatican officials have acknowledged 
the pope won't actually type the messages and that someone in the 
Vatican's secretariat of state will write them on his behalf. But they 
have insisted that the words will be his alone, culled from his 
speeches, homilies or catechism lessons.

As incongruous as it may seem for the
85-year-old Benedict to be on Twitter, Vatican officials have stressed 
that he is merely walking in the footsteps of his predecessors in using 
the latest in communications technology to spread the faith.

Pope Pius XI, for example, caused a 
similar stir when he launched Vatican Radio some 80 years ago to bring 
the pope's message on radio waves around the globe. The Vatican also has
its own newspaper, television service and maintains dedicated YouTube 
channels and an Internet news portal.

Although Pope Benedict sent today's first tweet
himself, in the future most will be written by aides 
and he will sign them off before they are sent.

The tweets will be going out in Spanish, English, Italian, Portuguese, 
German, Polish, Arabic and French. Other languages will be added in the 
future.

Greg Burke, senior media advisor to the Vatican said the Twitter handle @Pontifex is appropriate for a number of reasons.

'The
handle is a good one. It means "pope" and it also means "bridge 
builder",' he said. 'The Pope wants to reach out to everyone.

'We are going to get a spiritual 
message. The Pope is not going to be walking around with a Blackberry or
an iPad and no one is going to be putting words into the Pope's mouth.

'He will tweet what he wants to tweet,' Burke said.

Primarily
the tweets will come from the contents of his weekly general audience, 
Sunday blessings and homilies on major Church holidays.

They will also include reaction to major world events, such as natural disasters.

But while the Pope will be one of the
world's most high-profile tweeters and have many followers, he will not
be following anyone himself.

The
Pope's Twitter page is designed in yellow and white - the colours of 
the Vatican, with a backdrop of the Vatican and his picture.

It may change during different liturgical seasons of the year and when he is away from the Vatican on trips.

The Vatican said precautions had been taken to make sure the Pope's certified account is not hacked. 

Only one computer in the Vatican's secretariat of state will be used for the tweets.

Pope Benedict XVI blessed the possibilities of social media last year but warned it may lead to isolation.

'The
Pope's presence on Twitter is a concrete expression of his conviction 
that the Church must be present in the digital arena,' the Vatican said.

'This initiative is best understood 
in the context of his reflections on the importance of the cultural 
space that has been brought into being by the new technologies ... the 
Pope's presence on Twitter can be seen as the 'tip of the iceberg' that 
is the Church's presence in the world of new media,' it said in a 
statement.

The Pope, who still writes his speeches and books by hand, has given a qualified blessing to social networking.

In
a document issued last year, he said the possibilities of new media and
social networks offered 'a great opportunity', but warned of the risks 
of depersonalisation, alienation, self-indulgence, and the dangers of 
having more virtual friends than real ones.

The
Vatican decided against using a personal Facebook page for the pope 
because they thought it was too personal an interaction and would 
require more manpower to keep updated.

In
2009, a new Vatican website, www.pope2you.net, went live, offering an 
application called 'The Pope meets you on Facebook", and another 
allowing the faithful to see the pontiff's speeches and messages on 
their iPhones or iPods.

The
Vatican famously got egg on its face in 2009 when it was forced to 
admit that, if it had surfed the web more, it might have known that a 
traditionalist bishop whose excommunication was lifted had for years 
been a Holocaust denier.
