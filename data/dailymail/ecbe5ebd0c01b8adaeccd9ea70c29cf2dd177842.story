This is the retired Chinese woman who has spent every day for 14 years swatting flies.

Ruan Tang, 80, from the Changmingsixiang Community in eastern China's Hangzhou City, has dedicated eight hours a day, seven days a week, to killing the pest.

She estimates that she can kill about 
1,000 flies a day, sometimes sitting by a litter bin for two hours at a 
time to make sure that she has got all the flies hiding inside.

The woman took up her unusual and time 
consuming hobby when she retired - as she wanted to do something useful 
for the community.

The woman is now being praised for her dedication by Chinese media.

She said: 'I had retired and was looking around for something to do to help the community and prove useful, and I noticed how much flies were troubling people in the summer.

'I decided that killing flies was the best way for me to be useful - and I've been doing it now every day since.'

In a story written about the woman, a Chinese local paper said  flies are an 'enemy of the people, noisy, disease spreading and revolting'.

It also adds that they are hard to kill and breed very fast.

The woman says she kills up to 1,000 flies a day - with her neighbour calling her a heroine for her work

The local newspaper concluded: 'She manages to kill them in an environmentally friendly way, who knows how many flies there would be in the area if she was not in action.'

She told local television: 'I feel it is a great honour to help neighbours to wipe out disgusting flies. It is also great to have a meaningful role me to do so in my age, and it helps me to keep fit.'

Neighbour Jian Hsiao, 58, added: 'She is really a fly killing specialist, she is our heroine.

'Just imagine how many of these pesty insects would be there if she had not been wiping so many out every day.'
