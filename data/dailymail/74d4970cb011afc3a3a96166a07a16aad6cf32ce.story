Is this the victim? Inquiries carried out in the area of the murder have uncovered evidence that the victim could have been Abdullah Jan Agha

Relatives of a Royal Marine sergeant found guilty of murdering a Taliban insurgent last week are living under military guard amid fears that revealing his identity could pose a security risk.

Marine A, as he was referred to throughout a court martial, is expected to be named by a judge before he is sentenced for the execution of a badly wounded enemy captive in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, two years ago.

But senior military sources fear the lifting of reporting restrictions could lead to revenge attacks by Islamic radicals.

Protective measures around Marine A’s family have been increased in light of the potential threat.

A source close to Marine A’s family said: ‘Obviously they recognise there is an increased risk but the wider family of the Royal Marines is providing full support, which they are very happy with and grateful for. They are also appreciative of the sympathetic coverage he has received in the media.’

Marine A’s lawyers are to appeal against Judge Advocate General Jeff Blackett’s verdict that the anonymity order should be lifted.

The appeal is backed by Marine B and Marine C – who were cleared of the same charge – as they too face being named.

Many military figures believe the anonymity order should remain in place. But last night Admiral Lord West, a former Chief of the Naval Staff, told The Mail on Sunday he thought Marine A should be named.

Marine A will today attend a Remembrance Sunday service at the Colchester Military Corrective Training Centre. He is expected to remain there until December 6, when he will be sentenced and transferred to a civilian prison.

Former Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Lord West, pictured with Gordon Brown in 2007, said Marine A must be named. The soldier had said: 'Obviously this doesn't go anywhere, fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention'

Evidence: Footage captured by a camera mounted 
on the helmet of a Royal Marine and played during the court martial 
proceedings recorded the moment the soldier shot dead the insurgent in 
an Afghan field

A foreign field: After a two-and-a-half week 
trial, a seven-strong military board found Marine A guilty. His comrades -
named only as Marine B and Marine C - were cleared after nine hours of 
deliberations

Recording: The footage recorded on Marine B's 
helmet camera showed Marine A, a highly respected non-commissioned 
officer, order his men to move the captive out of sight of cameras on a 
surveillance balloon

Scene:
The prosecution said a single gun shot was fired into the heavily 
injured insurgent's chest at this spot, shown in the video which has 
been blocked from release in case it is used for propaganda by jihadi 
websites

Audio: 'It's nothing you wouldn't do to us,' a soldier is heard saying in the recording after the shot is fired

The matter of whether Marines A, B and C – and Marines D and E against whom all charges were dropped – will be named will be decided by the Court Martial Appeal Court later this month.

Yesterday, Prime Minister David Cameron pledged his support for the Royal Marines.

He said: ‘I want to say a big thank you to the Royal Marines for the incredible work you have done in Afghanistan over the last decade. I believe we will be able to leave that country with our heads held high.’

A distinguished Royal Marines commander, Major General Julian Thompson, added that it was important to remember that Marine A was subject to the ‘unique pressures of war’ when he illegally shot the wounded Afghan on September 15, 2011.

He said: ‘I am sad for the man who did it, in that he probably had a moment of stupidity. I feel for him as I would my own son who might do something stupid.’

Marine A was convicted after footage emerged of him shooting the insurgent at close range in the chest.

Major General Julian Thompson, a Falklands War veteran, said it was important to remember Marine A had been subject to the 'unique pressures of war'. He added: 'He probably had a moment of stupidity'

As the man convulsed on the ground, Marine A told him: ‘There you are. Shuffle off this mortal coil, you ****. It’s nothing you wouldn’t do to us.’

He then turned to comrades and said: ‘Obviously this doesn’t go anywhere, fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention.’

A total of 30 British soldiers have been investigated over shooting incidents involving members of the Afghan Security Forces or insurgents since 2006.

Of the 30 soldiers, marines and airmen investigated in 22 separate inquiries, only three have faced court martial and only one – Marine A – has been convicted. the figures were revealed by a Mail on Sunday Freedom of Information request.
