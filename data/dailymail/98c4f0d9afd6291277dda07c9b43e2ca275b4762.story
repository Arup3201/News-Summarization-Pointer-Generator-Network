Women could evolve out of having the menopause so that they can have children at a later age, according to scientists.

With improved medical treatments for an ageing population, experts say there is no need for the menopause, which only serves to stop older and younger generations competing.

Scientist and writer Aarathi Prasad explained that no other animal underwent the process whereby a woman stops ovulating, which in turn making her infertile.

Scientists say that in the future women well into their 50s could mother children. They believe that women will either evolve out of the menopause or targeted gene therapies will be developed to treat the condition

She said that the process was abnormal, that there was 'no benefit' to the condition and that women should not have to go through it.

The Daily Telegraph reported that older women are becoming increasingly healthy and could be able to have children in their 50s.

If experts are correct, pregnancy will one day not only be the preserve of the young

Speaking at the Telegraph Hay Festival, biologist Aarthi Prasad, said that the menopause is something that could be 'overcome' as we evolve.

She explained that scientists are 
investigating early menopause and looking for a specific gene that 
causes the condition.

This could eventually lead to gene therapy for all women.

She said: 'The mood of scientists working on this and looking into the future is we will either technologically or scientifically evolve out of the menopause.

'It is a health risk and it is a real and inescapable block on reproduction for one half of us - the women, but not the men.'

The researcher in cancer genetics at Imperial College London argued that ovarian failure should be treated like any other organ failure.

She pointed out that women were at an increased risk of certain conditions such as osteoporosis and breast cancer after the menopause.
