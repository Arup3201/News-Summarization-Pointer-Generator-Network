A man confessed to stabbing his girlfriend to death because she did not tell him she was HIV positive before they had sex.

'She killed me, so I killed her', Larry Dunn Jr, 36, told officers in Dallas, Texas, after the body of Cicely Bolden, 28, was found by her two young children returning home from school.

The 28-year-old was lying naked from the waist down on her bedroom floor bleeding from two stab wounds in her neck.

'Something's wrong with mama': Cicely's two young children found her dead body in the bedroom of their home

Ms Bolden and 36-year-old Dunn had recently started dating. He later told police that when she confessed to having the virus she then told him it was 'not that bad'.

He became upset and walked to the kitchen to get a knife which he used to kill her with, according to police.

Neighbor Latoya Arnett, who called 911, told Kens5: 'All I know is, she didn't deserve it and her kids didn't deserve to see her like that.

'She was a good mom. Loved her kids to death. I can't imagine my kids seeing me like that. I know it hurt them.'

Suspect: Larry Dunn told detectives he knifed Cicely Bolden after she told him she had the HIV virus

Police
 say Dunn cooperated fully with their investigation.

During a recorded 
interview he admitted the crime and revealed he burned his clothes 
afterwards and dumped the knife in the garbage at a waffle house.

Police later recovered the weapon.

The
 father of Cicely's son, Jeff Busby, told Fox that Bolden had contracted
 HIV within the last couple of years. He is currently looking after her 
son and daughter.

Speaking about Dunn, who is being held on $50,000 bond, he said: 'I hope he rots in prison. She did not deserve this.'

Ms Arnett said she went inside the 
apartment and found Cicely lying on the bedroom floor.

Earlier that day, she claimed, she had 
seen Dunn arriving at the apartment.

Stuffed teddy bear toys have been 
laid outside what's now a boarded-up apartment in Highland Village Drive
 with candles lit in memory of Ms Bolden.
