Plans to erect a life-size Subbuteo style referee statue at the Cambridge park where the first game with modern rules was played have hit a snag after a councillor worried it may not represent minorities

A plan to mark the birthplace of modern football with a statue has fallen foul of political correctness with questions over what race and sex it should be.

Councillors want to erect a life-size Subbuteo-style referee in the Cambridge park known as Parker’s Piece where students played the first game of soccer with proper rules.

The £142,000 figure was due to be erected to mark this year’s 150th anniversary of the founding of the Football Association.

But the project has been put on hold because issues have been raised about the model’s skin colour and sex.

One councillor questioned plans to base the statue on a white man, saying it does not represent the racial minorities and women involved in the modern game.

There has even been a discussion about making two statues - at three times the cost - to make sure no-one is offended.

But local football bosses have condemned the row as pointless 'political correctness'.

The disagreement means the 6’7” statue will not be completed until 2014 at the earliest - a year too late for the FA anniversary.

The race row emerged when minutes from a Cambridge City Council meeting in June were released.

Council lead for public places, Cllr Andrea Reiner said: 'I think you will have to ask the councillor who raised the issue what her concerns were exactly.

'The concerns raised about the race and gender of the referee were not the most compelling for me, but a fellow councillor raised an objection formally with officers, and I felt the project board should know about those concerns, to inform our discussion.'

Score: The figures of the iconic football tabletop game Subbuteo are instantly recognisable

She added: 'A new approach to the procurement of the final artwork has been proposed, which involves obtaining expressions of interest from artists.

'We need to get this right rather than get this fast, because this public art is going to last for generations.'

Kevin Satchell, chairman of Cambridge City FC, said: 'This all boils down to political correctness.

'Ten years ago no one would have a problem with putting up a white male referee statue - it’s the stereotypical image of a referee.

'I don’t see the problem, and even considering spending three times the amount to make sure they have two referee statues is just silly.'

The ‘Cambridge Rules’ of football were drawn up after a student meeting at Trinity College in 1848.

They included goal kicks, throw-ins and the ban on holding the ball and became the bedrock of the modern game when the FA was founded 15 years later.
