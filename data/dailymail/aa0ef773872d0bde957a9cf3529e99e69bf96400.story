Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Thursday
 she has not yet decided to run for the presidency in 2016, but that she has been mulling it over.

Clinton made the remarks while speaking in an hour-long interview with PBS television journalist Charlie Rose on his program of the same name as part of her 'Hard Choices' book tour.

When asked by Rose if her agenda will only be revealed after she makes a choice, Clinton said 'Yes, yes.'

'If I decide to run, I will have a very specific agenda about what I think we should be doing,' Clinton said on the program. 'But right now, we have a big election - midterms 2014 -  that could determine the control of the Senate. And I’m not going to - you know - jump the line and start talking about 2016 right now.'

Hard Choice: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, seen on Thursday at a book signing, says she has yet to decide whether or not she will run for president in 2016

Earlier in the interview, Clinton said 'You have to run a very specific campaign that talks about the changes you want to make in order to tackle growth, which is the handmaiden of inequality.'

When asked by Rose for a reason she would not seek office, Clinton revealed the reason 'would be wholly personal.'

'You know, I'm about to have my first grandchild, which I'm thrilled about, I can't wait [...] I want to see what that feels like,' she said, adding that she enjoys her life the way it is presently.

'I have seen [the presidency] up close now for more than 20 years,' she said to Rose, citing both her husband's presidency as well as that of President George W. Bush.

'You know, hard choices are not necessarily the same for everybody,' she also told Rose. 'You know for some people, running for president is the next step on a career and it's not hard at all.'

'Because I know so much about the job and how hard it is, I am very struck by the historic nature of a campaign that I in the future might undertake,' she later said on the PBS program, citing her failed 2008 bid for the Democratic nomination against then-senator Barack Obama - before she added 'but I also know the job has only gotten harder.'

Clinton also said on the program that the roles of head of state and head of government are both filled by the president, but that government is behind on offering support for the position.

'I just have to decide whether that's what I want to do at this point in my life,' she said. 'I mean, that's why I go back - it's a very personal choice.'

When asked by Rose about her relationship with husband and former president Bill Clinton, she described it as a 'deep profound connection that is love and companionship and support and intellectual rapport.'

'I mean it is just all of that rolled up into one,' Clinton said.
