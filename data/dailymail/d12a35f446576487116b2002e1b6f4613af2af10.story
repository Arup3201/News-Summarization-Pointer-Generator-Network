A mother who claimed her three-year-old daughter had been killed in a hit-and-run accident is being investigated after her story failed to match up with the medical examiner's findings.

Maryanne Schwartz, 22, told police her daughter Yeliani Schwartz-Ojeda had been knocked over in the parking lot outside their Orlando, Florida apartment block on Friday evening.

But the autopsy report has thrown doubt on her claims - showing the girl was malnourished and that her body temperature did not match up with the timing of the car accident, WKMG reported.

The medical examiner also concluded that the little girl had bruising over her body that was from prior abuse, and reported it to the Department of Children and Families.

Questions: Maryanne Schwartz, 22, (left in court) told authorities that her three-year-old daughter had been the victim of a hit-and-run accident but the autopsy has thrown doubts on the claim

The autopsy report concluded that Yeliani died of blunt force trauma, but it could not determine whether she had been struck by a car.

A representative with DCF said investigators interviewed other children, who belonged to Schwartz's partner and lived in the home.

The oldest child told the investigator they are hit as punishment, sometimes with sandals, but he said that the three-year-old girl had been treated the worst.

'The deceased child was always not listening and she was spanked and her hair had been pulled and different accusations of discipline due to her not listening,' said investigator Chandra Jones.

All of the children have been removed from the home, WKMG reported.

Among the children is Schwartz's two-year-old son, who also had bruises on his body, authorities said.

Scene: She said her daughter was hit outside their apartment on Friday, pictured, but authorities said the girl had no outward injuries or blood on her body when she was found

The mother appeared for a hearing in court at the weekend but so far no arrests have been made.

Schwartz had called emergency dispatchers around 9.30pm on Friday saying that her daughter had been hit by a car in the parking lot of the Grandview Pointe Apartments.

She said she was taking out the trash with her daughter when she turned around and saw her daughter lying in the parking lot while a black car sped away.

Investigators said the toddler had no visible injuries or blood on her body, WESH reported.

The mother said she was driving her daughter to the hospital, but dispatchers asked the woman to pull over and emergency workers took the girl to Arnold Palmer Hospital, where she died.

Investigators went to the family's home to collect evidence and are hoping security cameras in the apartment complex could provide clues to what happened.
