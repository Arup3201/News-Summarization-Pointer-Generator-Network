A man has amassed an incredible collection of 20,000 bottles of milk - even though he absolutely hates the taste.

Pensioner Steve Wheeler, 65, has been collecting the glass bottles from all over the world for 30 years.

The impressive collection is so big he has six sheds in the garden of his home in Malvern, Worcestershire, to store them all in, which he has dubbed the ‘milk museum’.

The bizarre collection, which is worth around £100,000, includes more than 17,000 British bottles and 2,500 from overseas which he has scavenged from farms, hills and everywhere imaginable.

Got milk? Steve Wheeler, inside his hand-built milk bottle museum. Remarkably the collector has not drank a glass of milk since he was a boy - as he hates the taste of it

Dedication: The 65-year-old milk bottle fanatic has amassed 16 tonnes of the bottles over the three decades

'I have got bottles from all over the world - milk bottles from Australia, Pakistan, America, Canada, if you can name it I have got it. I don’t have one from Iceland yet though,' he said.

'Wherever one goes in the world you come across a milk bottle and you just can’t help but look.'

His love for milk bottles began when he picked up bottles while out on walks in the countryside.

The grandfather of two said: 'I like glass which helps. If I was ever on a walk, I was the one on a mountain or a hill to pick up a bottle and put it in my bag.

'I remember getting my 150th milk bottle and being chuffed but the collection has grown incredibly since.

'I like the social history, the people I meet, I like the designs, the advertising they put on the bottles.

'I find it fascinating about the number of times it went back and forwards from the milkman to the customer.'

He displays 10-12,000 of the bottles at once in his 78 feet long and 12 feet wide museum

Glass diaspora: He said: 'I collect all sorts of things. I¿ve got cereal packets, unused airline sick bags, advertising playing cards, more than 4,500 pens loads of different things'

Favourite: His most-prized bottle has a picture of 1950s pin-up Zoe Newton emblazoned across it. She was an actress who featured in the Drinka Pinta Milka Day campaign

His favourite bottle has a picture of 1950s pin-up Zoe Newton emblazoned across it. She was an actress who featured in the Drinka Pinta Milka Day campaign and the bottle has the advertising slogan: 'Drink your health in milk everyday.'

The milk bottle fanatic has amassed 16 tonnes of glass bottles over three decades, with some dating as far back as 1880.

However, the collector has not drank a glass of milk since he was a boy - as he hates the taste of it.

Mr Wheeler explained: 'I don’t like it. It is baby food. When I at school the milk came from 20 yards down the road.

'In the winter it would freeze. As a milk monitor at school I had to bring it in.

'When it defrosted and we had to drink it the watered down milk was the most vile thing.'

But milk bottles are not the only thing Mr Wheeler collects.

He continued: 'I collect all sorts of things. I’ve got cereal packets, unused airline sick bags, advertising playing cards, more than 4,500 pens loads of different things.

'You could call me a serial collector but only in terms of the Kellogg’s packets,' he quipped.

Mr Wheeler says his wife Sue supports his unusual hobby, especially the exotic travel

His wife Sue, 65, is supportive of his quirky hobby.

Steve said: 'She doesn’t mind the collection. She like the old bottles mostly.

'The thing she likes most of all about it is the travel and going to places at the drop of a hat.'

He hopes when he starts collecting his pension in the coming weeks, Sue will allow him to use the money to extend his collection as there are still thousands of bottles he doesn’t have and wants to go in search for.

Mr Wheeler wants to set up an official museum to house his collection

He said: 'The secret is if you want to collect something then make sure it is fun and make sure it doesn¿t cost anything'

'I have got a database of more than 3,000 leads for new bottles that I need to follow up,' he said.

'I am trying to get the national heritage to open a national milk bottle museum. The collection is worth millions to me as it is my pride and joy.

'I will donate the entire collection for free if there is a national milk bottle museum and I will help them run the thing until I die.'

He welcomes enthusiasts to the museum regularly and last year had 50 visitors through the doors including milkmen and dairy workers.

He added: 'It is great fun collecting them but I try to keep it as serious as I can because it makes it easier to get more bottles. I always say to people don’t throw your old bottles away, give them to me instead.

'The secret is if you want to collect something then make sure it is fun and make sure it doesn’t cost anything.'
