It was the most treasured craft in Britain's possession when the Nazis declared war, but all of the Mk I Sunderland sea planes were thought to be long-lost after being gunned down in WWII.

The nation's only long-haul vessel, the 40 Sunderland flying boats were dispatched over the Atlantic Ocean and Germany to keep advancing submarines at bay.

But as the Germans upgraded their equipment over the years, the entire fleet was obliterated by being gunned down into the sea.

Exciting: This is what historians believe could be the only intact Mark I Sunderland flying-boat in the world as the others were gunned down in the Battle of the Atlantic

Prime: The craft was treasured by the RAF's commanders and Winston Churchill as the only planes that could fly long-haul. They were used to deter German U-boats

But decades on, in 2000, one of the prized crafts has been found wrapped in coral 65ft below the coast of Wales in what historians are touting as one of the most important discoveries this century.

And though it is in bits, the thick coating of mud and barnacles have preserved the Sunderland's structure perfectly.

Now, 73 years since it sank in 1940, naval historians are on the cusp of finally piecing the unique vessel back together in a project worth half a million pounds.

A
 deep sea diver accidentally discovered the wreckage after seeing a lobster-pot had become snagged on something below 
the waves 13 years ago.

The diver followed the rope down to the seabed and came across the world’s only surviving Mark I Sunderland flying-boat.

Experts identified the craft as Sunderland T9044 of No 210 Squadron, RAF.

Extraction: A major operation is now under way to lift the components out from the Welsh sea bed. Pictured here is a Sunderland propeller being raised onto shore

Last pilot: Wing Commander Derek Martin OBE, pictured left aged 20 in 1940, was the last pilot to fly this Mark I Sunderland when he was training a young aircrew. Now aged 93, Martin is helping the Pembroke Dock Sunderland Trust to identify different parts. He hopes the discovery will make people remember the work those pilots did

Prized: The first were created in 1937 and by 1948 they were already being used by the RAF. Pictured here is a Sunderland taxiing up the slipway at Pembroke Dock in 1943

To confirm the identity, they tracked down the bomber's last pilot: 93-year-old Wing Commander Derek Martin OBE.

Martin
 was aged 20 in 1940, training young aircrews, when he flew the 
Sunderland out of Pembroke Dock, in West Wales, the day before it sank.

He said: 'I flew it on a routine flight around the dock and then moored it up.

'There was a gale during the night and it must have been holed by some floating debris and down it went.

'In the morning it wasn’t there. Well, it was at the bottom of the sea.'

Sunderland flying-boats flew out of 
Pembroke Dock during the Battle of the Atlantic - when they were used to
 attack German U-boats sinking vital supply ships.

Newer models were created over time but for the large part of the war, RAF commanders adapted the Mark I Sunderland, which was feared by enemy crafts

Tarnished: Now in pieces and covered in barnacles, historians are desperate to piece it back together to recreate the 1940s state-of-the-art model

Between 1940 and 1943, Winston 
Churchill made it repeatedly clear to his troops that he wanted U-boats 
to be a priority, writing: '...the only 
thing that ever really frightened me during the war was the U-boat 
peril.'

More than 6,000 RAF aircrew were killed during the Battle of the Atlantic.

More than a year before the first prototype was built, the RAF ordered 21 production examples of the Mark I Sunderland flying-boat.

With a deeper hull and turrets on the nose and tail, it was a military version of the Empire crafts used by Imperial Airways.

Desperate to roll out the new model, the Air Ministry filed an order in 1937 to strengthen defences. The first was received in Singapore in June 1938.

By the start of the war, they had a fleet of 40, which acted as one of the major components of the UK's overseas operations for at least the first few months. In total, 75 were built.

Initially, it carried 910kg of bombs, mines and other weaponry. A year into the war, amendments were made to combat Nazi tactics.

Two Vickers K machine guns were attached to the wing, a second gun was added to the nose turret, and constant speed propellers and deicing boots were installed.

Many were kept at Pembroke Docks (above).

Martin,
 who now lives in the village of Colnbrook, Berkshire, was an instructor
 at a training unit based in Pembroke Dock when he last flew the plane 
in 1940.

Aircrews would have
 to fly up to 600 miles out into the Atlantic to escort convoys and 
attack German submarines who were slowly starving the British into 
submission.

They would be 
sent out across the oceans to intercept German U-boats using 
co-ordinates picked up by the secret codebreakers at Bletchley Park.

Having been brought in to work on the 15-year project, Martin became Patron of the Pembroke Dock Sunderland Trust in 2001 and has helped 
identify the parts of the plane dive teams have raised from the seabed.

The operation costs thousands of pounds, and it was only this year that the Trust managed to extract the front two turrets of the flying-boat.

They hope to have the entire vessel extracted and pieced back together in about a year's time.

Martin said: 'Sunderlands were the only long range British aircraft which 
could reach the middle of the Atlantic for the first couple of years of 
the war.

'We would fly out day and night to patrol around the convoys and protect them.

'If
 you were lucky you would sink a submarine. But just by being there you 
could force submarines to submerge and not get in a position to torpedo 
our ships.

'Ships crews would say once they saw us overhead they felt they were safe, which was very nice.

'Everyone
 rightly commemorates the sacrifices of Bomber Command airmen but it’s 
almost as if our contribution has been forgotten.

'Hopefully this Sunderland will help tell the story of what the crews of the flying-boats did for the nation.'

John Evans, who is project manager Pembroke Dock Sunderland Trust, said: 'We now have the world’s only Mark I Sunderland.

'We have identified it as Sunderland T9044 of No 210 Squadron, RAF, which sank at its moorings in a gale in November 1940.

'There was no crew on board and the aircraft was lost for decades before being re-discovered by divers.

'Despite all the years in the water it is immediately recognisable.

'Much of it is covered in mud and sediment - which has preserved the structure and turned it into a perfect time capsule.

'Two of its massive Pegasus radial engines and propellers have been raised from the wreck and are now being conserved and displayed in our museum.'

The Pembroke Dock Sunderland Trust was set up to preserve and protect the plane wreck and have begun raising it from the seabed.

Mr Evans, who is running the conservation operation, said: 'Derek has visited a number of times and has been a tremendous support to us.

'He piloted this plane and brings that incredible personal link with him - he would’ve heard the engines roar into life all those years ago.

Time capsule: The mud and barnacles covering the structure have preserved it. Experts are now matching the propellers they have lifted up with pictures like this

'Since the plane was first re-discovered around the millennium our volunteers have spent thousands of hours raising the plane in parts.

'This year we have raised a significant part from the turrets at the front of the aircraft and we intend to raise as much as we can from this unique wartime survivor.

'To raise it all is a massive undertaking but we intend to bring up as much as we can by the 75th anniversary of its sinking in 2015.'
