Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini accused his players of complacency after squandering a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at home to Burnley.

City were 2-0 ahead at half-time after goals by David Silva and Fernandinho but Pellegrini’s side switched off in the second period and allowed Burnley to rescue a point through Ashley Barnes’ late strike.

‘Maybe at 2-0, we thought the game was over,’ the City boss said, ‘Until the final whistle, the game is never finished. We changed our pace or we couldn’t continue at the same pace.’

Pellegrini’s side visibly flagged in the second half and the Chilean also suggested that his players struggled to cope with the physical demands after playing in snowy conditions and on a ‘heavy pitch’ at West Brom 48 hours earlier on Boxing Day.

‘It is clear that we couldn’t keep the same intensity in the second half. In the second way, because it is difficult for all the teams but especially our team to play on a heavy pitch the last game at West Brom. So it was hard to keep the same pace in the second half.’

City’s fitness struggles were further underlined by the vibrancy of their visitors, who only appeared to grow stronger as the game went on.

It is all the more impressive given that Burnley were unchanged from the team that played Liverpool on Friday and considering that manager Sean Dyche did not make a substitution during this game.

‘Do you know I think it’s incredible that people are making that point?,’ Dyche explained, ‘I don’t overthink it. There are no excuses from us on that. 

'I think we have played seven games less this season compared to last season. I never question the physicality of the group. They are super-fit. The distances have changed this season and we actually cover less distance in this division then they did in the Championship.’

Pellegrini also complained that the officials were responsible for allowing Burnley a way back into the game, arguing that George Boyd was in an offside position for Burnley’s first goal.

Dyche, for his part, admitted that he was happy to accept a ‘scratch of luck’.

His side remain in the relegation zone courtesy only of goal difference while City are still three points behind Chelsea in the race for the Premier League title.

Pellegrini has further concerns with Yaya Toure nursing a groin injury while Vincent Kompany still remains short of full fitness after picking up a calf problem. The duo are both major doubts for the clash against Sunderland on New Years Day.
