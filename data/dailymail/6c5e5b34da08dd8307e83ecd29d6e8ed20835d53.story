England's Stuart Broad and Joe Root have been named in the International Cricket Council's Test team of the year.

The mythical side, selected by a panel chaired by the ICC cricket committee chairman and former India captain Anil Kumble, sees Broad and Root rewarded for their work in helping rebuild the England side after their disastrous tour of Australia.

Root made three big hundreds in the English summer, scoring 200, 154 and 149, while Broad - one of the few bright spots Down Under - made contributions with both bat and ball and took 19 wickets as India were beaten 3-1.

Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews is named as captain of the side after leading his men to victory in England, while Kumar Sangakkara (for a seventh time) and Rangana Herath are his named compatriots.

South African pace bowler Dale Steyn is picked for the seventh successive year and team-mate AB de Villiers for a fifth time.

David Warner and Mitchell Johnson (Australia) and Kane Williamson and Tim Southee (New Zealand) make up the rest of the team.

There are no England players named in the one-day side of the year which is captained by India's MS Dhoni, named for an eighth time and a seventh year in a row.

De Villiers of South Africa, Virat Kohli of India and Ajantha Mendis of Sri Lanka are repeat selections, with the rest of the side comprising of Mohammad Hafeez (Pakistan), Quinton de Kock and Steyn (South Africa), George Bailey and James Faulkner (Australia), Dwayne Bravo (West Indies) and Mohammad Shami (India).

Angelo Mathews, leaving the Headingley ground out for 160, is captain of the mythical team 

'I would like to congratulate all the players for their selection in the teams of the year. It is an achievement to be proud of and recognition for their good performances in the qualifying period,' Kumble said.

'Team selection is one of the toughest jobs and when you have a large pool of outstanding players to select from in a 12-month period between 26 August 2013 and 17 September 2014, then it becomes even more difficult.'
