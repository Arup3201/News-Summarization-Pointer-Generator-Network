Financial advisor: Stephen Evans, 30, of Warrington, was running a Ponzi scheme to make himself rich

A CROOKED financial adviser dubbed the ‘Wolf of Old Hall Street’ bought a fleet of supercars, invested in a racehorse and even sponsored football clubs with the proceeds of a £4.4million Ponzi scheme.

Conman Stephen Evans spent £1.5million snapping up so many top-of-the-range cars a judge said they would fill several episodes of Top Gear.

Evans also splashed out £36,000 on yachts and £300,000 on jewellery, and paid £250,000 for a racehorse he renamed ‘Fat Gary’.

His case echoes that of 1990s fraudster Jordan Belfort, who conned investors in the US and was the inspiration for The Wolf of Wall Street film starring Leonardo DiCaprio.

Over three years Evans, 30, enjoyed a luxury lifestyle with other people’s money. He bought an astonishing fleet of 20 luxury cars, including a lime green Lamborghini and a Porsche 911 for his girlfriend as well as BMWs and Mercedes.

He ran his empire from Old Hall Street in Liverpool’s business district, but his reach stretched as far as the United Arab Emirates, where he recruited many of his victims.

He used more than £250,000 of ill-gotten cash to buy corporate sponsorship deals at Liverpool and Everton football clubs and was even pictured with Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard.

And after spending some £250,000 buying a racehorse called Saphir River, which he renamed Fat Gary, he shelled out £50,000 in stabling fees and handed a further £15,000 to Chester Racecourse to sponsor a race under the Fat Gary banner.

Then there was £280,000 on flights, hotels, chauffeurs and other travel expenses, including £90,000 at Hilton hotels, £70,000 on Emirates international flights and £21,000 at The Ritz in London.

On top of that, he spent £36,600 on two yachts for a staff trip to the Isle of Wight. He also rented properties at exclusive addresses and dressed himself in designer clothing and handmade bespoke suits.

Evans also used other people’s money to give generously to charity, including £59,050 to the Marina Dalglish cancer appeal and £52,000 to the charity of Liverpool celebrity hairdresser Herbert Howe.

Andrew West, prosecuting, told Liverpool Crown Court: ‘In short, the case against Stephen Evans is that he ran what is commonly known as a Ponzi scheme.

‘Between 2007 and 2010 Evans worked as a stockbroker and financial adviser for Globaleye Investment and One International in the United Arab Emirates.

‘He then set up his own company, Stephen Evans Investments Ltd. During this time he continued living in Dubai and the Isle of Man for tax purposes.’

Expensive tastes: Evans, who was jailed at Liverpool Crown Court, spent £21,000 visiting The Ritz (pictured)

Top class: He also visited Atlantis on the Palm Hotel (pictured), in Dubai, which came in at £19,500

It was when Evans set up his own 
company that the scams started. He persuaded clients to hand over large 
amounts of cash which he claimed would be invested but which he simply 
spent – and then sought new investors to repay what he owed the old 
ones.

In total, he took in 
around £4.4million, of which £300,000 was paid to his initial investors 
to keep the scam going.

Later arrivals, including one man who gave him 
£3.7million, received nothing back at all. It was, as Judge Denis 
Watson, QC, said, ‘doomed to fail’.

By the end of 2012 Evans was being 
tracked by a private detective hired by one of his clients and gave 
himself up to police in St Helens.

Mr West said: ‘The hounds were at his heels, the game was up.’

Named
 after one of the most notorious conmen in US history, the Ponzi scheme 
is an elaborate version of the oldest scam of them all - pyramid 
selling.

In its 
classic form, a Ponzi fraudster sets up a fund with a 'fail-safe' 
business plan. Investors join in their droves, lured by the huge returns
 on offer.

But the 
fraudster will merely pay off old investors with new money that comes 
into the fund. Eventually, all Ponzi schemes are doomed to collapse 
under the weight of new money flooding in.

The
 fraud was named after Charles Ponzi, an Italian who emigrated to 
America in 1903 with $2.50 in his pocket. After a spell in prison for 
fraud, he set up an investment scheme to exploit differences in the 
price of postage stamps in Italy and the U.S.

At
 the height of his success in 1920, Ponzi was making $250,000 a day - a 
mammoth sum for the era. When his scheme collapsed, Ponzi pleaded guilty
 to fraud and was sentenced to five years in a federal prison.

But that didn’t stop Evans lying to detectives, saying the investments had been legitimate business deals gone wrong.

He even bought a £21,000 BMW with stolen cash and tried to sell it.

He eventually pleaded guilty to ten counts of fraud and one of converting criminal property.

Christopher
 Stables, defending, said: ‘This was an unreal lifestyle, a Walter Mitty
 lifestyle. He was handling extremely large sums of money and was 
seduced by that lifestyle.

‘He
 was weak and he accepts that. It was a lifestyle that gave him high 
living, luxuries and mixing with celebrities. It was almost a drug.’

Judge Watson jailed Evans, of Great Sankey in Cheshire, for five years and three months, telling him: ‘You held yourself out as a financial adviser.

'The reality was you were a very plausible conman. You had superficial charm and amiability to impress would-be clients with the promise of high returns.

‘You demonstrated what can only be described as a flash lifestyle which you concocted to give the impression of success.

'The hospitality and wooing of clients was all done to get them on the hook.

‘The list of expenditures is breathtaking. You spent £300,000 on jewellery, £150,000 on accommodation, at least £50,000 on clothing, £300,000 on travel, £1.5million on cars.

‘You spent £300k on jewellery, £150k on accommodation, at least £50k on clothing, £300k on travel and £1.5million on cars.

'The cars would do justice to several programmes of Top Gear.

'This was relentless greed which knew no bounds.’
