A Norwegian football fan has won more than £500 after placing a £3 bet that Luis Suárez would bite someone at the World Cup.

Thomas Syverson, of Trondheim, placed a bet at 175/1 on online gambling website Betsson along with 166 other punters - one of whom scooped an even bigger win of almost £2,000.

A slip posted online shows the bet of 32 Norwegian Krone (£3.09) that was placed by Blackpool fan Mr Syverson - with his payout coming in at 5,600 Krone (£540.26).

He told AftenPosten: ‘I woke up just before it happened, so I was not awake. I saw the incident on replays. It was pretty special. For me it was a success, so I'm happy.

‘I think Luis Suárez is a very good football player, but I’m a Blackpool supporter. So therefore I would not wear a Suárez shirt. But maybe I’ll buy one for my girlfriend.’

Mr Syverson added that he is celebrating his girlfriend’s birthday on Saturday, so will spend some of the prize money on a ‘nice gift’ for her.

Fifa’s disciplinary committee said 
this morning that it had opened proceedings against Liverpool player 
Suárez, and has asked his team to present evidence by 5pm local time 
(9pm BST) today.

A decision
 on whether he is guilty of 'assaulting an opponent' must be published 
before Saturday, when Uruguay play Colombia in a Round of 16 match.

The
 clash last night in the sweltering Arena das Dunas in Natal, Brazil, 
came in the final 15 minutes of a tense decisive match between Italy and
 Uruguay. Both teams were fighting for qualification for the next round and the score still stood at 0-0 in the final minutes.

Then,
 27-year-old Suárez clashed with Italy's Chiellini, 29, with live 
footage showing him lean his head towards his opponent's shoulder.

Both players fell to the ground with Suárez clutching his infamous teeth while Chiellini gesticulated furiously and pulled down his shirt to show the point of impact.

Close-up images appeared to show the imprints of at least five teeth on Chiellini's naked shoulder.

But Liverpool FC star Suárez was not handed a yellow or red card - and minutes after the confrontation Uruguay went 1-0 up, winning the match and qualifying for the knockout stages.

Chiellini, who plays for Italian team Juventus, reacted furiously after the final whistle and insisted he had been bitten.

Just 14 months ago Suárez spent 10 matches on the bench and apologised for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in a 2-2 draw between Liverpool and Chelsea.
