A Canadian woman is suing a police force for $400,000 after an officer handcuffed her and put her in the back of a police vehicle with an unhandcuffed sex offender who raped her.

The unnamed victim was 17 at the time of the September 2011 assault, according to The Independent, and said in the lawsuit that the incident left her with post-traumatic stress disorder. 

The woman, now 21, was held by Danielle Gallant, a former constable of the Kativik Regional Police Force, on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly, the New York Daily News reports.

The rookie officer, who had been with the force for less than a month, handcuffed the woman, placed her in the back of a van with 24-year-old Joe Kitrik, and left.

Kritik, who was picked up earlier that night, was listed on Canada's sex offender registry and had already been convicted of four sexual assaults, CBC reports.

He was not handcuffed.

The lawsuit states that when Gallant returned to the vehicle Kritik had his 'pants down while on top of the plaintiff,' according to the Independent.

'The plaintiff was unable to defend herself, being handcuffed in her back and unable to leave the vehicle, the doors being locked,' the lawsuit claims. 

Gallant pulled Kritik off of the woman and took the two to the police station in Tasiujaq, a village in Quebec. 

The Independent reports that the woman was kept in a holding cell overnight, and was not given medical attention. Her parents were not contacted. 

Kritik pleaded guilty to the sexual assault and was sentenced to 39 months in prison, CBC reports, Gallant was suspended and later resigned.

An investigation by the force cleared Gallant of any wrongdoing.

The lawsuit against Gallant, the  Force and the Kativik Regional Government seeking $400,000 (509,180 CAD) in damages states that the force exhibited a 'serious lack of professionalism.'

It claims the force exhibited gross negligence 'by leaving an inexperienced police officer, with no knowledge or life experience of northern Quebec populations, and without the authorization to carry a firearm, to ensure alone the security of the public.' 

That was more than three years ago, but the suit claims that the incident has taken a toll on the woman, the Independent reports.

A psychologist's report states that the woman suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and has nightmares about the assault.

She is afraid of men and will not leave her home by herself.
