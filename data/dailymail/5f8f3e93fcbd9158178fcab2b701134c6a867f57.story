Francois Hollande’s former partner has demanded ‘respect’ from his current girlfriend in an increasingly bitter war of words.

The French media have likened the spat between Segolene Royal, the mother of the president’s four children, and first lady Valerie Trierweiler, who is nicknamed The Rottweiler, to ‘Dallas at the Elysee Palace’.

Miss Royal, a former presidential candidate who lived with Mr Hollande for 30 years before he left her for Miss Trierweiler, is standing for parliament in the western town of La Rochelle against Left-winger Olivier Falorni.

'Mortified': The former partner of French President Francois Hollande, Segolene Royal (left), has been left infuriated by new First Lady Valerie Trierweiler (right) who tweeted support for her parliamentary election rival

Stuck in the middle: French President Francois Hollande, pictured today meeting the Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, has become 'a man sandwiched between two women'

She was outraged when Miss Trierweiler tweeted warm support for Mr Falorni. 

Prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault 
intervened to tell the new first lady to ‘know her place’, while a 
French newspaper described Mr Hollande as ‘a man sandwiched between two 
feisty women’.

More than 24 hours after Ms Trierweiler’s tweet, Ms Royal finally 
reacted publicly at a political meeting in La Rochelle last night.

She said: 'I did not want to react yesterday because the blow was so 
violent. But that does not mean I didn’t feel mortified by it, I am not a
robot.

'I demand respect as the mother of a family whose children hear what is said.

'I didn’t want to respond in the heat of the moment because I am 
fighting a tough political battle and I need to stay in a good state of 
mind.

'As a woman politician, I demand to be respected, just as the political 
support the president is giving me as a candidate should also be 
respected.'

Socialist Ms Royal, who lost the presidential election to Mr Sarkozy in 
2007, is now standing for MP against break-away left winger Olivier 
Falorni in the western town of La Rochelle.

While the president is backing his ex-girlfriend to win the seat, Ms 
Trierweiler wrote on Twitter on Monday: 'Good luck to Olivier Falorni 
who was not unworthy, who has fought for the people of La Rochelle for 
so many years with selfless commitment.'

The comment was swiftly condemned as ‘like Dallas at the Elysee Palace’ by French news magazine Le Nouvel Observateur.

Telling off: Following Valerie Trierweiler's (pictured right) Twitter comments, Prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said 'everyone should know their place'

The L’Alsace newspaper wrote: 'It’s a slap in the face. In just a few 
lines, Ms Trierweiler has single-handedly destroyed all Francois 
Hollande’s efforts to appear strong, serene and reassuring.'

The Journal de la Haute Marne called the Tweet: 'A venomous personal 
spat between two women being carried out within the cauldron of 
politics.'

And it added: 'This necessarily weakens Francois Hollande by casting heavy doubt on his ability to control the situation.'

Prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault then gave Ms Trierweiler a humiliating public telling off on national radio.

He told France-Info radio: 'Her role is a discreet one which is not easy to pin down. Everyone should know their place.'

Twice-divorced Ms Trierweiler yesterday refused to apologise for the 
Tweet and said it was ‘idiotic’ to suggest she was jealous of Ms Royal.

And she insisted it was ‘unfair’ to brand her a traitor for backing rival socialist candidate Olivier Falorni.

She told RTL radio: 'To speak of jealousy in this business is idiotic.

'I see no muddying of public and private lives here. It has got out of 
all proportion and things should be got back into perspective.'

Mr Hollande and Ms Royal lived together for 30 years before the president left her for Ms Trierweiler in 2005.

News magazine L’Express wrote of Ms Trierweiler last month: 'For her, 
Segolene Royal remains the object of profound and irrational jealousy 
that complicates political relations.

'It is almost impossible to even speak about the woman in front of her, 
even from a purely political angle. It’s stronger than she is.'

A socialist party insider described her backing of Mr Falorni as a ‘devastating blow’ for an ‘infuriated’ Ms Royal.

He added: 'The party has been plagued by in-fighting for many years, but
Segelone never expected the President’s new lover to make such a 
provocative gesture.'

And a senior Elysee Palace aide told Le Monde newspaper yesterday: 'I am
completely blown away by what has happened. I expected a government 
crisis, not a domestic one. It’s amazing.'
