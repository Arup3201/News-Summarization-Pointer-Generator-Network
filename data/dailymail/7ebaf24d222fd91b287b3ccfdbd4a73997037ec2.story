Stoke City have completed the £1million season-long loan signing of Oussama Assaidi from Liverpool.

The 26-year-old spent last season on loan at the Britannia Stadium, joins Mame Diouf, Steve Sidwell, Phil Bardsley, Bojan, Victor Moses and Dionatan Teixeira as Mark Hughes' summer signings.

Oussama Assaidi has returned to Stoke on another one-year loan deal

The Moroccan international scored a last-gasp winner against Chelsea in the 3-2 win last December, and Stoke made a move for Assaidi after Peter Odemwingie suffered a knee injury in the 1-0 win over the reigning Premier League Champions Manchester City at the weekend.

Hughes told the club's website: 'It’s clear from talking to Oussama that he really enjoyed his time with us last season and he’s looking forward to picking up where he left off with us.'

Chief Executive Tony Scholes said: 'We thought we had concluded our incoming transfer business for this transfer window but we re-evaluated our plans after losing Peter to injury for the foreseeable future.'

Assaidi made 19 Premier League appearances for the Potters last season and also scored against Newcastle and Everton and in a Capital One Cup tie against Birmingham.
