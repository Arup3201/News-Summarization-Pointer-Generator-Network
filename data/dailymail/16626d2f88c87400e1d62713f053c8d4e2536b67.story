A pair of bear cubs have been left orphaned following the capture of their mother by Italian authorities after she attacked a mushroom picker.

Officials in Trento captured the brown bear, called Daniza, on Wednesday and she was tranquilised with an anaesthetic.

However, the mother failed to wake up and now animal rights groups are calling for the resignation of the Italian environment minister after the forestry police opened an investigation into the capture operation due to the death of the animal.

Authorities authorised the captured of Daniza after a mushroom scavenger in Trento, reported that she attacked him last month 

Daniza's story has captivated Italians ever since a mushroom scavenger reported that she attacked him last month in northern Trento province.

Daniele Maturi, who was foraging in the woods near Pinzolo survived the attack but suffered bites as well as scratches to his wrist, legs, knee and back.

A team of specialists was then sent to search for their bear, who was reintroduced to the Italian countryside as part of an EU-funded operation after they were almost wiped out decades ago.

But animal rights activists say the bear should have been left alone as she was merely trying to protect her eight-month-old cubs.

On Wednesday it was ordered for the bear to be captured but after being tranquilised, she failed to wake up.

The last picture to be taken of Daniza, using an infra-red camera, shows her with one of her young cubs. Activists say she should have been left alone and not pursued 

Italy's national forestry police opened an investigation and speculated that criminal charges could result for the mistreatment and death of an animal.

The forestry police had actively protested Daniza's capture on the grounds that her cubs weren't yet old enough to care for themselves.

The National Animal Protection Agency, a non-governmental organisation, called for Environment Minister Gian Luca Galletti to resign, alleging he didn't do enough to protect Daniza.

Daniza, pictured, was introduced to the Italian countryside in 2000 following a bear re-introduction programme called Live Ursus 

The EU-funded programme went ahead after the bear population decreased in Italy and nine bears from Slovenia were flew into the country 

But Mr Galletti said he had asked Trento officials for a report on what went wrong and said the priority must now be to care for Daniza's cubs.

The bear re-introduction project, called Live Ursus, began in 1999 with the introduction of nine brown bears from Slovenia.

Animal rights activists have praised the project, but residents say the programme has been too successful and that too many bears are now roaming a densely populated area, killing livestock and increasingly running into humans.
