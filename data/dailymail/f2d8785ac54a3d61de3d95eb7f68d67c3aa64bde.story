Experienced amateur jockey Tom Weston was airlifted to hospital after being kicked by horses following a fall at the Cheltenham Festival.

Weston, who turned 28 this week, was on board Benbane Head in the penultimate race of the day, the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup for amateur riders, when he fell at the fourth from home.

Benbane Head was in the middle of the field, and the jockey appeared to be struck by several following horses.

He was immediately treated by doctors before being taken to the course’s medical centre and then flown by air ambulance to Bristol’s Southmead Hospital.

Cheltenham spokeswoman Sophia Brudenell said that he was conscious and breathing at the time, and that he was subject to ongoing assessment and treatment.

Benbane Head is trained by Gloucestershire-based Martin Keighley, who said shortly afterwards: ‘Tom’s not quite with it at the moment, but at least he is conscious and he seems much better than he initially did.’

The accident caused a 15-minute delay to the running of the final race of the day, the St Patrick’s Derby, which is run in aid of the Injured Jockeys’ Fund.

While the horse escaped unscathed, a further update on Weston’s condition is expected on Friday morning.

Two years ago in the same race, leading amateur jockey JT McNamara, from Limerick, was left paralysed after suffering a serious neck injury when thrown from his horse, Galaxy Rock.

McNamara fractured two vertebrae and underwent rehabilitation at the North West Regional Spinal Injuries Centre in Southport, Merseyside.

He only returned home to Ireland last June after being discharged from the unit.
