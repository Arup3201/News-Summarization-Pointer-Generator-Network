Flight Lieutenant Adam Sanders, 27, had been missing since the accident involving two jets over the Moray Firth on July 3, along with Squadron Leader Samuel Bailey, 26.

The discovery comes as the funeral of a third pilot killed in the crash was held this afternoon in his hometown of Bangor, Wales.

Ft Lt Hywel Poole, 28, an officer from 15 (Reserve) Squadron and based at RAF Lossiemouth in Moray, died in hospital after being picked up by a helicopter from the scene.

He had been training on the Tornado GR4, the aircraft involved in the crash, since November last year.

A spokesman for the RAF today said: 'The 
RAF can confirm that the remains of Flt Lt Adam Sanders have been 
recovered from the area of the Tornado accident in the Moray Firth.

'Formal identification has been 
completed and the next-of-kin have been informed. Additional remains 
have also been recovered and are in the process of being formally 
identified.

'Our thoughts and prayers remain with the next-of-kin of the aircrew involved in the accident all at this very difficult time.

'The next-of-kin of the aircrew 
involved in this tragic incident and all at RAF Lossiemouth are very 
grateful for the tremendous show of public support that has been evident
since.'

Days after the crash, Captain Ian Gale, station commander at Lossiemouth base, said there was 'no expectation' of recovering Flt Lt Sanders and Squadron Leader Bailey alive.

The Tornado GR4 is a two-seat attack jet carrying a variety of weapons and can reach an altitude of 50,000ft (15,240m).

The salvage operation got under way last week and the Military Aviation Authority says all of the wreckage has now been recovered.

The RAF spokesman said the service inquiry panel, helped by the Military Air Accident Investigation Branch, will “work quickly and thoroughly to investigate the circumstances of the accident”.

Flt Lt Sanders was educated at Scarisbrick Hall School in Lancashire before joining the RAF.

Squadron Leader Bailey was originally
from Nottingham and joined the Tornado force in 2001, serving in Iraq. 
He had been an instructor with 15 (Reserve) Squadron since 2004.

A fourth crewman is still in a serious condition in hospital.

The Duke of York attended a memorial service for the men at RAF Lossiemouth and tributes have been paid by Prime Minister David Cameron, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond.

Members of the public lined Bangor's streets today as the funeral of an 'exceptionally talented' RAF airman took place.

Flight Lieutenant Hywel Poole, 28, died in hospital following the mid-air collision between two Tornado jets.

A private funeral service took place today at the cathedral in his home city of Bangor, North Wales.Scores of people stopped in silence outside the cathedral to pay their respects as the funeral cars arrived.

The coffin, covered with the Union flag and a wreath of poppies, was carried into the cathedral by colleagues from 15 Squadron.

Other personnel from RAF Lossiemouth formed a guard of honour as it was taken inside.

During the service, conducted by Reverend (Flight Lieutenant) Stewart Shaw, tributes were paid to the airman by colleagues and loved ones.

Hymns including I Vow To Thee My Country and the Welsh language Calon Lan were sung.

A flypast by three RAF Lossiemouth Tornados was expected to take place later as a wake is held at RAF Valley on nearby Anglesey.

Group
Captain Ian Gale, station commander at Lossiemouth, said the deaths of 
Flt Lt Poole and his colleagues were a 'dreadful loss' to 15 Squadron 
and the RAF.

Speaking 
before the funeral began, he said: 'The loss of these men has been felt 
very, very deeply by the military family but our grief is second 
obviously to that of the families.

'H
was a kind and compassionate man, always had time for those around him,
always giving the personal touch and an exceptionally talented pilot to
boot.'

Grp Capt Gale said 
Flt Lt Poole had won prizes for his flying and had been due to move to 
617 Squadron - the famous Dambusters - on completion of his training 
this month.

'Professionally,
the RAF has lost an exceedingly fine officer and H undoubtedly had a 
glittering career ahead of him and our thoughts and sympathies are with 
every member of his family,' he added.

He
said the investigation into the cause of the accident was continuing 
and the RAF will 'move swiftly' to establish the cause and the answers.
