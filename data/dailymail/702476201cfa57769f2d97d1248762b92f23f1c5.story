Wanted: Samuel Nathan Duran is suspected in the shooting of at least three, maybe four, police officers

A thug who shot three officers - including one in the jaw - has surrendered after hours spent barricaded in a California home.

Samuel Duran, 32, of Roseville, initially shot an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Friday afternoon before shooting three local police who pursued him, said authorities.

Mr Duran took cover in a nearby home and was engaged in a long standoff with police before they had him surrounded.

A SWAT team was stationed around the property, as police made repeated calls for him to emerge, calling: 'We have the house surrounded. Come out with your hands up'.

Meanwhile family members gathered outside encouraging him to give up the fight.

After a robot was sent in at 11pm, and a negotiator spoke to Mr Duran on the phone at 12.30am, he emerged and was taken to hospital for a medical examination in an ambulance, CNN reported.

He will then be taken to jail.

Armed with an assault-type rifle, Mr Duran had taken hostages but they somehow were able to sneak out of the home's back door, according to a police spokesperson.

A known gang member currently on parole, Mr Duran's criminal record shows charges for carjacking and resisting arrest, according to News 10.

The violent thug fled the scene of the first shooting - where he shot an ICE officer in the leg just after 3pm - ran to a nearby house and kicked in the door while being chased by authorities, according to reports.

The other three officers shot were hit in the shoulder, jaw and an unspecified body part, police said.

Police had been searching for the wanted man for the past week, according to the Roseville Police Department. He was wanted for recent incident involving a knife, family members told News 10.

He also fired at officers trying to establish the six-block perimeter, according to reports and may have been wounded in the exchange, according to the Roseville Press Tribune.

The officer shot in the jaw is in serious condition, two are stable, according to Roseville Police Chief Daniel Hahn, who briefed local media.

The officer struck with a bullet fragment has been released from a local hospital, the department announced.

'They came to work today to do their job… and a very violent
person injured them, we’re just hoping they recover quickly,' he added.

Chief Hahn declined to name the officers and federal agent, but did confirm they are all force veterans, and are male.

Mr Duran's aunt claimed late Friday 
night to CBS Sacramento that the fourth officer was actually shot by his
partner, and that she has it on video.

'Sammy, you didn't shoot that cop, Sammy,' the woman cried out. 'Sammy, that other cop shot that cop.'

'Just
surrender yourself, get out, come on baby, come home, it wasn't your 
fault Sam,' she continued.

Her claims are unsubstantiated as of this time, the video has not yet surfaced.

Other family members who spoke to CBS Sacramento  also pleaded to him to turn himself in.

'We love you Sam, if you're watching please come out,' a cousin told the station.

'We want him to surrender, but we want it to be a safe surrender,' the family member said. 'We want him to have a fair chance.'

The home owner fled as soon as she saw him run through her yard, she told KCRA.

‘It's really scary to know that he's in there,’ said Brenda Bell.

Her pets remain in the home.

Another neighbor told KCRA that he saw Mr Duran enter Ms Bell’s backyard holding a handgun and immediately called it to the attention of police in the area.

‘We have the perimeter surrounded, we have him locked down,’ Roseville Police Lt. Cal Walstad said during an evening briefing.

The known gang member was targeted in a joint investigation being conducted by federal agents and the Roseville Police Department, according to the Sacramento Bee.

Police had been searching for Mr Duran for a week when the ICE agent came in contact with the violent criminal.

The initial shooting put area schools on lockdown throughout the afternoon, Fox 40 reported. It is not clear if those student have yet been allowed to return home. Roseville Police announced late Friday evening that lockdown orders had been lifted.

At one point, three-quarters of a mile of the town, about 20 miles northeast of Sacramento, was completely locked down, KCRA noted.

'This is the biggest police operation of its kind in the region in recent history,' said Chief Hahn.
