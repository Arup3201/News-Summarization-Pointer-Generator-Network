A woman and three brothers associated with the Brothers for Life gang will today be charged with the execution-style shootings of Mahmoud Hamzy and Joe Antoun on the streets of Sydney.

Associate Mahmoud Hamzy, cousin of jailed Brothers for Life boss Bassam Hamzy, was shot dead in Revesby Heights, south-west of Sydney, on October 29 last year.

Amanda Crowe, 32, was arrested at her Dulwich Hill home in Sydney's inner west around 6am on Monday and has since been charged with murder and other offences relating to Mr Hamzy's death. 

Two men have been charged with the shooting death of convicted standover man, Joe Antoun, at his home in Strathfield last December 

Crowe did not apply for bail when she fronted Burwood Local Court on Monday, but her lawyer said she would when she returned to court in November, the ABC reports.   

Three brothers - Fahed Quami, 32, Mumtaz, 29 and Jamil, 22 - also appeared in Burwood Local Court charged with Mr Hamzy's murder.

The three Quami brothers were all in custody on other charges.

Fahed and Mumtaz Quami were also charged with an additional count of murder for the roles they allegedly played in the fatal shooting of convicted standover man, Joe Antoun, at his home in Strathfield, in Sydney's inner west, last December.

The 50-year-old construction industry identity was shot four or five times in the head and chest after opening the front door of his home.

His wife Tegan Mullens tried to revive him as their two six-year-old twin daughters watched on.

Mr Antoun had been in and out of jail for the past three decades.

He and his brother Antoine were charged in 2001 with attempting to extort a cafe owner in Darling Harbour. His conviction was eventually overturned in 2006. 

Two other people have already been charged over Mr Antoun's death, including Navid Khalili, 25, and Kasim Ali Khan, 24. 

At the time of his death, Fairfax Media reported Mr Antoun had been involved in an ongoing feud with another well known construction industry figure reportedly worth millions of dollars.

The Commander of the Homicide Squad, Detective Superintendent Willing, said the charges for both Hamzy and Antoun's deaths stemmed from some outstanding police work.

'The detectives working these cases have done an outstanding job,' Detective Superintendent Willing said.

'Their investigative nous and unyielding commitment has resulted in numerous people being charged with murder and other major criminal offences.

'To date, four people have been charged in relation to the murder of Mahmoud Hamzy and four have been charged in relation to the murder of Joe Antoun.

'Rest assured, more charges will be laid in the future as we intend to hunt down and bring to justice anyone who was involved in these ruthless crimes.'

Mr Antoun, had been in and out of jail for the past three decades, was shot four or five times in the head and chest in front of his wife Tegan and two six-year-old twins
