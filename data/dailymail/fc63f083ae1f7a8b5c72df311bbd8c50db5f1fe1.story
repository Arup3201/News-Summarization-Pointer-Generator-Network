Britain hit back last night after Argentina vowed to complain to the United Nations that the Falkland Islands were being ‘militarised’.

Politicians and military veterans mocked President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner as ‘troubled’ after she accused the UK of ‘risking international security’ by deploying HMS Dauntless and Prince William to the South Atlantic.

She pleaded with David Cameron to ‘give peace a chance’, adding: ‘We are not attracted to armed games, or wars.’

Tensions between Britain and 
Argentina have simmered  recently prior to the 30th anniversary of the 
start of the 1982 Falklands war.

Both countries have accused the other
 of ‘colonialism’ and Buenos Aires has led a ban on Falklands-flagged 
ships from South American ports.

The row deepened when the UK announced 
it was sending the £1billion Type 45 destroyer HMS Dauntless to patrol 
the waters.

The Mail understands a ‘hunter-killer’ submarine will also 
be sent.

Argentina has also condemned the ‘provocative’ decision to send the Duke of Cambridge as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot.

The Argentine president insisted the
 UK was flexing its military muscles. ‘We cannot interpret in any other 
the sending of an immense and modern destroyer accompanied by the Royal 
heir,’ she said.

Downing Street yesterday rejected the
 president’s comments. ‘We are not militarising the South Atlantic. Our 
defensive posture in the Falkland Islands remains unchanged,’ said a 
spokesman for the Prime Minister.

Dick Sawle of the Falklands’ 
legislative assembly said: ‘This is nonsense. The UN has given us the 
right to self-determination and there has been no increase in military 
presence.’

Falklands veteran Simon Weston, who 
was badly injured in the conflict, which cost 255 British and 649 
Argentine lives, called the Argentine president ‘troubled’.
