It sounds like the bargain of a lifetime - a house has gone on the market in Washington DC for free.

There is, inevitably, a catch.

The new owners will need to lift the house, a rare 1926 Sears Wellington model, off the current plot and move it somewhere else, and that could cost up to $50,000.

Free: The house in Arlington won't cost you a penny - but moving it will

The house cost the owner $750,000, but it's too small for her needs

The unnamed homeowner bought the house for $750,000 last September, but found that it wasn’t quite big enough for her needs.

As the house has some historical worth – it still has the original door frames and wooden shingles – she decided, with her architects Paola Lugli and Paola Amodeo, that it would be a crying shame to demolish it.

They’re hoping now to find someone willing to tackle the complications and expense of detaching the house from its utility connections, building a foundation somewhere else, moving the house over to it and reconnecting it.

The architects estimate that it'll cost up to $50,000 to move the house and reconnect it

Amodeo told The Washington Post: ‘We need someone with an adventurous spirit. Someone who can appreciate the project.’

The house, the architect explained, is part of America’s history and demolishing such a building is not part of the firm’s philosophy.

The house is located in an upmarket area of Washington DC, where five and six-bedroom houses are commonplace
