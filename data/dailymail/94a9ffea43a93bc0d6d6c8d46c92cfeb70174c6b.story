More than half of Britons do not use enough sunscreen and a quarter use cream that is two years out of date

More than half of Britons do not use enough sunscreen, according to a new survey.

The study found that 57 per cent of people use out of date sunscreen and that 26 per cent apply cream that is more than two years old, meaning that it provides only a fraction of the intended protection.

More than half of Britons also admit not applying sunscreen frequently enough, and 60 per cent say it is too expensive, the Asda poll found.

Nine per cent of Brits don't use sunscreen at all.

In light of the findings the supermarket is calling on the government to drive down the price of sunscreen, which is classed as a 'luxury item' subject to VAT, rather than an essential health product.

Almost two thirds of those surveyed said that the tax should be removed, and Asda plans to lobby the government to cut VAT on sunscreen.

Dr Dawn Harper, who is supporting Asda's campaign, said: ‘As the sun comes out everyone is keen to enjoy the fun that comes with it. 

‘However, Brits need to take sun protection seriously. Malignant melanoma is the fastest rising common cancer in the UK and is particularly high in younger people.

‘Shockingly, allowing your child to play in the sun unprotected is a much higher risk than allowing them to smoke a cigarette - just ten minutes in strong sun can be all it takes for the sun's UVB rays to burn the skin. Just one episode of sun burn can trigger melanoma.

Dr Dawn Harper is supporting Asda's campaign to encourage people to use sunscreen and is calling for the government to stop charging VAT on it

‘Regular use of sunscreen in the first 18 years of life can reduce the lifetime risk of non-melanoma skin cancers by 80 per cent. Sunburn in childhood is believed to be a primary cause of melanoma, so we are asking Brits to stay safe and slap on a capful.’

British Skin Foundation spokesperson, Hermione Lawson, added: ‘By the end of this summer, around 1250 people in the UK will have died from skin cancer.

‘We support Asda's Don't Get Burnt campaign to highlight the serious health risks posed from sun damage. What people often don't realise is that skin cancer is largely a preventable disease, and along with clothing and shade, high factor sunscreen can help protect the skin from the harmful effects of the sun.’
