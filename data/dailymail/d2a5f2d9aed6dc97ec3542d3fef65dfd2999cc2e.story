An unidentified spokesman for the film said that the contractors had been brought in to reinforce the building after it was deemed unsafe by the producers, and that the ceiling collapsed during the reinforcement, killing one worker and injuring two 

A spokesman for the film said in a statement that there was 'an unfortunate accident' at the Central Motion Pictures Corporation lot Taiwan, according to Deadline Hollywood.

The spokesman said that the contractors had been brought in to reinforce the building after it was deemed unsafe by the producers, and that the ceiling collapsed during the reinforcement, killing one worker and injuring two.

'Everyone is in shock and sorrow and expresses their deepest concern and sympathy to the families of the individual who died and those who were injured,' the spokesman said.

The lot belongs to the Chinese Culture and Movie Center, which issued a statement saying the contracting film crew bore responsibility for health and safety in the accident 

Silence's cast includes Taken star Liam Neeson, The Amazing Spider-Man star Andrew Garfield and Girls actor Adam Driver.

The film is an adaptation of late Japanese writer Shusaku Endo's 1966 novel of the same name that surrounds the persecution of Jesuit priests that try to bring Christianity to Japan during the 17th century.
