A new online screening test for sexually transmitted infections will allow Australians to bypass their GP, scheduling tests online and receiving their results by SMS.

The SmartSex website, to be rolled out in Sydney this week, allows patients to register online to be tested for a range of STIs.

A pathology appointment is then booked without the need for a consultation with a GP and the results of the urine and blood test are then sent to the patient's phone.

The SmartSex website was launched this week in Sydney. It allows people to book STI tests online and receive results via SMS

If the person tests positive for one of the infections, their results are also sent to their local GP and an appointment is then set up.

The website comes as rates of STIs have increased dramatically in Australia, with a 79 per cent increase in diagnosis of STIs in the last 10 years.

Some of the most common sexually transmitted infections include syphilis, chlamydia, hepatitis B, gonorrhoea, and HIV/AIDS, all of which have seen significant increases in rate of diagnosis in the last 10 years.

More than 26,000 new cases of STIs were diagnosed last year in New South Wales alone, according to the Department of Health, though thousands of these cases go undiagnosed.

The test is particularly aimed at people who feel embarrassed to visit their GP to discuss STIs

The SmartSex website aims to make testing easier and more discreet for those who might feel embarrassed to have a conversation about sexual health with a GP, with researching suggesting that women aged 18-30 are the most reluctant to visit their GP to get tested for STIs.

'There are some people who don’t consider themselves to be a risk. There are also a group of people who find it difficult because they don’t want to bring it up with their doctor,' Associate Professor David Wilson of the Kirby Institute told Daily Mail Australia. 

'Some research particularly done out of the University of Melbourne, shows rates of testing are relatively low among young men and women.'

However, Dr Wilson warns that not getting tested for STIs can do long term damage.

'The most common STI that is reported in Australia is chlamydia, and if left undiagnosed, it leaves somebody much more likely to be susceptible to infertility or ectopic pregnancy, it would roughly triple one’s risk.'

There are approximately 80,000 diagnosed and 400,000 undiagnosed cases of chlamydia in Australia.

Safe sex messaging services have been available for years, but the SmartSex website is unique in that it sends information to a patient's GP if it is suspected they have an STI, meaning they are less likely to slip through the cracks.

'We know that one of the most important things to do to bring down the high rate of STIs in this country is to get more people screened,' said Dr Wilson.
