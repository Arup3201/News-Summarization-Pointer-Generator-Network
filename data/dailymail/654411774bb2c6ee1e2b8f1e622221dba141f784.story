Found: Connie McCallister, who has been missing since 2004, has made contact with her family

A Wisconsin woman found in Mexico nine years after she disappeared at the age of 16 claimed she was drugged and taken abroad against her will.

Connie McCallister, now 26, was rescued after a church missionary told the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children that she had been spotted.

The honor-roll student at Athens High School weighed just 98lb when she was found, and had been working as a field laborer in Mexico under a new name, after escaping two abusive relationships.

Miss McCallister claimed she had contacted local police about five years ago for help but her family say they heard nothing from her until September 15 this year.

Before than, the last contact Miss McCallister had with her family
was on August 15, 2004, when she called her sister to say her boyfriend 
was refusing to let her leave.

The then-teenager, who had recently moved to Wausau, had been dating a 22-year-old Mexican, who has not yet been identified.

'He told her everything that she needed to hear, and she got involved with him,' Judy Weise, who is raising funds to bring Miss McCallister and her three children, Olivia, Jennifer and Christina, back to the U.S. said.

'They went to a party in Milwaukee and [McCallister] called her sister and said "He won't bring me back", and that's the last anyone heard from her, until September 15,' she told the Journal Sentinel.

She said the young woman, whose daughters are aged 3, 5 and 7, told family she was drugged and taken to a foreign country against her will in 2004.

The Trinity Lutheran Church in Athens, which Miss McCallister had been involved in as a teenager, is now trying to raise money to bring her back.

Ms Weise told Mail Online: 'We need $5,000 to bring her and her three kids back and to raise additional money for health issues that need to be addressed.'

She added: 'Connie has only spoken with her aunt and brother on Skype. She is safe but she doesn't leave the house without her husband.'

Ms Weise, who knew Miss McCallister before she disappeared, added: 'She is coming back to central Wisconsin with her three children and petitioning for her husband to join them.'

Police said they first heard rumors 
that the missing woman was in Mexico years back, but couldn't confirm it
until three months ago.

'We
have confirmed, through conversations on Skype, that this is really 
Connie, and she did ask for help in getting home,' Wausau Police Captain
Greg Hagenbucher said. 'But she won't come back without her children.'

He
did not immediately return a call from Mail Online on Wednesday about further details in the case or claims that Miss McCallister's former boyfriend is wanted on charges 
of first-degree sexual assault involving an unrelated victim.

'I don't believe she has been out of Mexico since she got there in 2004,' Captain Hagenbucher told ABC 9.

Miss McCallister escaped from her boyfriend but ended up in another abusive relationship with a man who fathered her first child.

At one point he beat her so badly that she was taken to hospital, where someone helped her get a new identity, Ms Weise, who works for Trinity Lutheran Church in Athens, said.

Florence Volzka, one of Miss McCallister's aunts, said that with no proof of her identity, and unable to speak Spanish, Miss McCallister struggled to contact her family.

She worked in fields and later married and had two more children.

'She’s excited and she’s cautious and she knows it’s going to be whole new world again and she’s afraid,' Ms Volzka said. 'There are a lot of adjustments.'

The 56-year-old said she never gave up hope that her niece would be found, adding: 'I always thought she would find a way home. She is very close knit with the family.'

Officials with the U.S. Consulate are working with Miss McCallister to gather the required documents and identification records necessary for her to return, Police Detective Kay Hansen said.

Trinity Lutheran Church has set up a fund to help Miss McCallister return.

'It's very costly to get someone through
all of this process,' Ms Weise said. 'They need car seats, clothes and 
bunk beds. Connie is dealing with health issues - she's only 98lb -
and needs medical care and three children need immunizations.'

The woman's mother, Cindy, moved to Florida after her daughter disappeared but several other family members still live in Wausau.
