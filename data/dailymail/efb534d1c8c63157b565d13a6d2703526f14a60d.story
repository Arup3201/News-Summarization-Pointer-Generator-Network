UFC star Daniel Cormier has decided it was time to declare to the world how much he loves chicken and cake through the medium of song.

The fighter appears in a highly amusing parody video of the Meghan Trainor hit 'All About That Bass', but replaces the final word of the title with his favourite poultry dish.

Cormier appears shirtless to perform in the skit for the 7th annual fighters only MMA Awards.

Cormier recently suffered the first defeat of his professional career, losing in a unanimous decision to Jon Jones in Las Vegas last month.

But Jones has since failed a drugs test, and he is referenced in Cormier's parody video.

35-year-old Cormier previously wrestled for the USA, competing at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.
