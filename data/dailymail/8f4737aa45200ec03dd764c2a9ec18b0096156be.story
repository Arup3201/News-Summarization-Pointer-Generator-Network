Apple and Google's Motorola Mobility unit have agreed to settle all patent litigation between them over smartphone technology, ending one of the highest profile lawsuits in technology.

In a joint statement on Friday, the companies said the settlement does not include a cross licence to their respective patents.

The deal ends between Apple and Google's Motorola Mobility one of the highest profile lawsuits in technology.

Apple and Google have both been sued nearly 200 times in the last five years by businesses that exist solely to file patent lawsuits.

Apple last year was the top target for patent lawsuits, and Google was among the top three.

To combat trolls, both companies earlier this year asked the Supreme Court to make it easier to collect lawyersâ€™ fees from patent holders who lose frivolous patent suits.

Now, the firms plans to work together to bring about patent reform.

'Apple and Google have also agreed to work together in some areas of patent reform,' the statement said.

Apple and companies that make phones using Google's Android software have filed dozens of such lawsuits against each other around the world to protect their technology.

Apple argued that Android phones that use Google software copy its iPhones.

The two companies informed a federal appeals court in Washington that the cases should be dismissed, according to filings on Friday.

However, the deal does not appear to apply to Apple's litigation against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, as no dismissal notices were filed in those cases.

However, patent expert Florian Mueller says the deal could mean an end to that dispute is also in sight.

'At first sight one would assume that this Apple-Google agreement makes a near-term Apple-Samsung settlement much more likely, but this depends on whether Apple's decision-makers have fully realised just how non-thermonuclear their patent portfolio is,' he wrote.

He also believes the settlement was due to both sides realising they were unlikely to win outright.

'The parties have entered into a second-class settlement from a position of mutual weakness.

'They had to recognise that under the procedural circumstances their patents were not strong enough to give either party decisive leverage over the other, at least not anytime soon.'

The most high-profile case between Apple and Motorola began in 2010.

Motorola accused Apple of infringing several patents, including one essential to how mobile phones operate on a 3G network, while Apple said Motorola violated its patents to certain smartphone features.

Motorola, owned by Google, accused Apple of infringing several patents, including one essential to how cell phones operate on a 3G network, while Apple said Motorola violated its patents to certain smartphone features.

The cases were consolidated in a Chicago federal court.

However, Judge Richard Posner dismissed it in 2012 shortly before trial, saying neither company had sufficient evidence to prove its case.

Last month, the appeals court gave the iPhone manufacturer another chance to win a sales ban against its competitor.

Google acquired Motorola Mobility in 2012 for $12.5 billion, and this year announced was selling Motorola Mobility's handset business to Lenovo, while keeping the vast majority of the patents.
