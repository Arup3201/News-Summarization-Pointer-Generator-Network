Major League Baseball 
is threatening to kick Alex Rodriguez out of the game for life unless 
the New York Yankees star agrees not to fight a lengthy suspension for 
his role in the sport's latest drug scandal, according to a person 
familiar with the discussions.

The person spoke to The Associated Press on Wednesday on condition of anonymity because no statements were authorized.

Whether
Commissioner Bud Selig would actually issue a lifetime suspension was 
unclear and a permanent ban could be shortened by arbitrator Fredric 
Horowitz to about 200 games, the person said.

Ban: Alex Rodriguez faces the possibility of a lifetime ban from baseball as he continues to fight doping allegations

The number of players likely to be disciplined stood at 14 Wednesday.

Front
and center is Rodriguez, baseball's highest-paid player and the most 
prominent one linked in media reports over the past seven months to 
Biogenesis of America, a closed Florida anti-aging clinic that allegedly
distributed banned performance-enhancing drugs.

The
Yankees expected Rodriguez to be accused of recruiting other athletes 
for the clinic, attempting to obstruct MLB's investigation, and not 
being truthful with MLB in the past. Baseball has considered suspending 
him for violations of its labor contract and drug agreement.

Even
if he is banned from baseball, there is precedent for a shortened 
penalty: When pitcher Steve Howe was given a lifetime ban in 1992 in 
his seventh suspension for drug or alcohol use, an arbitrator reduced 
the penalty to 119 days.

A three-time MVP, 
Rodriguez acknowledged four years ago that he used performance-enhancing
substances while with Texas from 2001-03 but repeatedly has denied 
using them since.

He's been sidelined all 
season since hip surgery in January and then a quadriceps strain during a
minor league rehabilitation assignment in July. The Yankees say he'll 
start another rehab Friday - Double-A Trenton appeared to be the likely 
destination.

'Hopefully Alex will be back shortly thereafter,' Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said.

Rodriguez didn't stop to talk with reporters after his workout Wednesday at the team's minor league complex in Tampa, Fla.

At
first, MLB and the union thought talks on the Biogenesis probe could be
completed by Friday, but negotiations to avoid grievances are likely to
push back announcements until at least Saturday or Sunday.

Others
accused in media reports of receiving performance-enhancing drugs from 
Biogenesis include a trio of 2013 All-Stars: Texas outfielder Nelson 
Cruz, San Diego shortstop Everth Cabrera and Detroit shortstop Jhonny 
Peralta.

Most of the players face 50-game bans
as first offenders. Both sides felt urgency to complete the process 
because by the middle of next week, teams will have fewer than 50 games 
left. And that would force players to complete suspensions during the 
playoffs or at the start of next season.

Detroit
general manager Dave Dombrowski protected against a possible suspension
of Peralta by acquiring slick-fielding infielder Jose Iglesias from 
Boston in a three-team trade Tuesday night.

'If
it were a 15-day thing, like a typical injury, I think we could have 
comfortably dealt with it with the players we already have,' Dombrowski 
said Wednesday. 'But when you start to talk about 50 days and a possible
playoff run, we feel better going ahead with Jose.'

Circus: The doping allegations have created a media circus around A-Rod that might be distracting - if he were actually playing

While
MLB told the union which players it intends to suspend, it hasn't 
issued formal notices of discipline. Because of that, the countdown 
hasn't started under baseball's Joint Drug Agreement, which says the 
suspensions are effective on the third business day after the notice is 
issued.

The sides also haven't decided whether
suspensions for first-time offenders who challenge the penalty can be 
announced before an arbitration decision.

If some stars knew their seasons were about to be cut short, they weren't letting on Wednesday, at least publicly.

'I can't talk about nothing right now. Just wait for the news,' Cabrera said Wednesday before playing against Cincinnati.

Peralta thinks he shouldn't be on the list of players linked to Biogenesis.

'It's wrong,' he said. 'But whatever happens, I need to fight and try to move on.'

Toronto
outfielder Melky Cabrera, Oakland pitcher Bartolo Colon and San Diego 
catcher Yasmani Grandal were all suspended for 50 games last year for 
positive tests for elevated testosterone. MLB informed the union they 
won't receive additional discipline for that violation, two people 
familiar with the probe said. They also spoke on condition of anonymity 
because no statements were authorized.

'Nothing's
been told to me,' Melky Cabrera said. 'I served my suspension last 
year, but MLB has never told me that it's OK now. I'm seeing it in the 
press, but I don't know.'

Texas was unable to find a replacement bat to fill a void a suspension of Cruz would create.

'I
don't think anybody's comfortable losing a significant part of your 
club, but it's out of our control,' Rangers general manager Jon Daniels 
said. 'We explored some deal like that. They just didn't come to a head.
It wasn't for lack of interest or lack of effort. It was more lack of 
supply and lack of fit, really.'
