A Georgia man who moved all the way to Kentucky to meet a girlfriend he'd only known online in person was so upset by how different she looked in person he allegedly attacked her.

Cornelius Jefferson, 33, is being held at the Laurel County detention facility.

He faces fourth-degree assault charges.

According to the Laurel County Sheriff's Department's Facebook page, Jefferson was arrested at 4:20 a.m. Tuesday morning. 

'This subject had allegedly moved from Georgia after meeting this female subject on the Internet,' authorities wrote.

'The argument was allegedly because the male subject didn't think she was like she was on the Internet, and he allegedly choked her with both hands around the neck and threw food on her and left the scene on foot with two suitcases.

'Deputy Morris located the subject on Litton town road, nearby. 

'Cornelius Jefferson was charged with assault fourth degree – domestic violence and was lodged in the Laurel County detention facility,' the report concludes.
