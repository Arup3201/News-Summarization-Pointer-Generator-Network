The armed forces will be given £100million to repair crumbling accommodation and soldiers will receive 'full' council tax relief while deployed, George Osborne said today.

The Chancellor also said the families welfare grant, paid while servicemen are on the frontline, will be doubled.

Mr Osborne's announcement will boost morale within the army as spending cuts mean it will shrink to just 84,000 regulars by 2014.

The cost of the Afghanistan war will be £2.4billion lower than previously forecast between now and 2015, the Chancellor said.

Britain is planning to pull all troops out of Afghanistan by the end of 2014 along with the U.S.

Mr Osborne said servicemen will receive 100 per cent relief on an average council tax bill while deployed. This will be worth around £600.

Speaking to the Commons, the Chancellor said individual servicemen and women would benefit from his budget.

'We will fund an extra £100million of improvements in the accommodation of our armed forces and their families,' he said.

'I will also double the families 
welfare grant which is used to provide additional support to the 
families left behind when people deploy.

'We've already doubled the operational allowance. Today, I am doubling the rate of council tax relief.

'The thousands serving our country in operations overseas will receive 100 per cent relief on an average council tax bill.'

With the average council tax bill at around £1,200 a year, a soldier deployed for six months will be able to claim around £600 council tax relief, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said.

Before today's announcement it would have been closer to £300.

The families welfare allowance is currently worth £2.20 per week - or around £60 for a six-month tour of duty.

The fund is given to Regiment Commanders to pay for activities like coffee mornings and childrens' play days for the families of soldiers in action.

Following the Chancellor's announcement, their budget for putting on events will be doubled to £4.40 a week.

Last year the Government unveiled plans to enshrine the military covenant in law - in recognition of their 'unique service'.

The Government's Strategic Defence and Security Review concluded the Armed Forces must lose 17,000 posts by 2015 - 7,000 in the Army and 5,000 each from the RAF and Royal Navy.
