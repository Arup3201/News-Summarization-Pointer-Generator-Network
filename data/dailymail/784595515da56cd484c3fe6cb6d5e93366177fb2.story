Plans for a supercar capable of reaching 340mph have been revealed by a Manchester firm.

Called the Keating Bolt, it will cost £750,000 and go from 0-60mph in just two seconds.

The company, which is run by Dr Anthony Keating, has produced three previous models - the SKR, the TKR and the ZKR.

Its new car will produce 800 horsepower, the firm said.

The project is the brainchild of the managing director of Keating Supercars, Tony Keating from Bolton who has invested millions of pounds in the project.

A prototype of the new supercar will attempt to break the world speed record for production cars in Ras al Khaimah in the United Arab Emirates later this year when it will aim to beat the 300mph barrier.

Tony Keating (pictured right) with veteran broadcaster Gordon Burns (left) said the car is designed for real supercar enthusiasts with very deep pockets and a twin turbo charged version of The Bolt would travel faster than any supercar in history

Tony, 41, said: ‘The car is unique with many of the components engineered in our own workshop. For real supercar enthusiasts, with very deep pockets, a twin turbo charged version of The Bolt would achieve 0 to 60mph in 2 seconds and travel faster than any supercar in history.’

Keating Supercars previously held the world record for a production car in 2009 recording 260.1 mph at Salt Lake Flats, California.

The Bolt has already attracted the interest of motor manufacturers from around the world and it¿s hoped that it will go on sale to the public next year

The record is currently held by a Bugatti Veyron at 268mph.

The Bolt has already attracted the interest of motor manufacturers from around the world and it’s hoped that it will go on sale to the public next year.

It was developed with help from the University of Bolton’s Centre for Advanced Performance Engineering, where Keating began working on the gearbox design for the car when he was a student there.

Vice Chancellor, Professor George Holmes, said: ‘The University is thrilled to be associated with the development and launch of such a supercar and proud that the man behind it is one of our outstanding graduates.’

The car is powered by a 7.0-litre LS7 V8 in the center of the car.

Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed transmission.

The Bolt will use carbon and Kevlar panels to reduce weight and also has power steering and air-con, as well as safety systems like ABS.

At full power, The Bolt can burn its way through a full tank of petrol in nine minutes.
