Morning commuters were stunned to see a hot air balloon, which had been enjoying a scenic flight over Melbourne, descend in the middle of a car park on Monday.

'Light and variable winds' forced the pilot and his nine passengers to land outside Footscray Town Hall on Monday at around 7am, not far from a busy railway line. 

According to Mike, a caller on 3AW Radio who witnessed the landing, there was 'a mild scene of panic as crew and people who were on the balloon madly tried to pack up the balloon'. 

Onlookers were stunned when a red hot-air balloon landed in the empty car park at Footscray Town Hall on Hyde St in Melbourne's west on Monday morning at around 7am

But Damian Crock, director of Picture This Ballooning, told Daily Mail Australia that the landing was 'routine' and safety was the pilot's priority.  

'The winds became light and there was not much reliable steerage. Rather than using up lots of fuel, the pilot found a safe and available landing spot', he said.

Mr Crock said the hour-long flight was close to its end when it landed in the car park. 

The balloon displaying the Fujitsu logo allegedly landed 25-metres away from a railway line connecting Footscray and Seddon train stations.

Thankfully, no one was injured during the impromptu landing. 

'Everyone had a ball and they all went back to breakfast at level 35 at the Sofitel Hotel. They all had a marvellous time', Mr Crock said. 

Action shots taken from onlookers show the red balloon making its way down from the sky to the empty car park, as the balloon slowly deflated to the ground.

Picture This Ballooning has made around 15,000 landings in Melbourne since it was established 18 years ago.

'Annually we might get a couple of routine landings - they are quite uncommon'. 

Mr Crock said Melbourne was the first city in the world to begin flying commercial hot air balloons and now balloons fly nearly 150 days a year.

Earlier this year, another Fujitsu balloon was forced to make an emergency landing in a home's front yard in Hawthorn, Melbourne. The pilot was forced to land after winds took control of the balloon, 3AW reported. 

The Fujitsu balloon was flying for nearly an hour before it made a 'routine landing'. Onlookers watched as the balloon slowly deflated to the ground

Thankfully, the pilot and his nine passengers were not injured during the impromptu landing
