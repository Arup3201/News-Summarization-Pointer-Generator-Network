Each week Sportsmail gathers up the ratings from our team of reporters to provide the best Premier League starting XI of the day.

Saturday saw Liverpool get back on track with a 2-1 home win over West Brom and Manchester City keep in touch with leaders Chelsea after their win at Aston Villa.

There were wins too for Hull City and Sunderland, while Leicester City vs Burnley and Swansea vs Newcastle ended two-apiece.

GK - Brad Guzan (ASTON VILLA vs Manchester City) - 8

Although Villa ultimately finished without a point to show for their efforts, Brad Guzan kept them in contention for long spells with a string of absolutely brilliant saves. He made good stops from David Silva, Sergio Aguero and Eliaquim Mangala in the second half but Guzan and Villa ultimately succumbed.

DEF - James Chester (HULL vs Crystal Palace) - 7

Hull claimed their first home win of the Premier League season against Crystal Palace and also kept their first clean sheet since the opening day. Chester played a central role in this and was watertight as part of a three-man defence.

DEF - Nathan Baker (ASTON VILLA vs Manchester City) - 7.5

Produced a committed performance at the centre of the Villa back line, always putting his body on the line. He made a superb early block on Yaya Toure and also thwarted Edin Dzeko with a last-ditch tackle as he bore down on goal.

DEF - Eliaquim Mangala (MANCHESTER CITY vs Aston Villa) - 7

The defender has sometimes carried an air of nervousness about him - something that was particularly evident at Hull City last weekend - but here he was reliable and solid all afternoon. This will come as a huge relief for City and Manuel Pellegrini after they shelled out £32m for him.

DEF - Aleksandar Kolarov (MANCHESTER CITY vs Aston Villa) - 7

A constant threat advancing forward down the left, as shown by the fierce shot that smashed against the post in the opening 10 minutes and the pinpoint cross that almost set up Sergio Aguero to score.

MID - Michael Kightly (BURNLEY vs Leicester City) - 7.5

The man to finally end Burnley's goal drought - after 10 hours and 54 minutes of football - Kightly had an impressive afternoon as the Clarets picked up a much-needed point at Leicester. Kightly seized on a knockdown by Lukas Jutkiewicz to sweep the ball past Kasper Schmeichel after 39 minutes.

MID - Mohamed Diame (HULL CITY vs Crystal Palace) - 8

The Senegalese midfielder has been excellent since arriving on Humberside from West Ham on deadline day, scoring three times in four matches. His header on the hour mark from Andy Robertson's cross set Hull on their way to an important victory against Palace.

His manager Steve Bruce said afterwards: 'He's not quite complete but he's big, strong, athletic, he handles the ball well. He's good in the air.'

MID - Jordan Henderson (LIVERPOOL vs West Brom) - 7.5

Henderson was the match-winner at Anfield as Liverpool ended their recent slide with a win over West Brom - but his 61st-minute goal was merely the highlight of another commanding display from the England midfielder. Henderson had earlier played a one-two with Adam Lallana for Liverpool's opening goal before half-time. 

His boss Brendan Rodgers said: 'Jordan is the one player in the country who can dominate games without the ball because he has this wonderful physical capacity. But today was about him getting a bit more forward and his winning goal came when he arrived into the box.'

MID - Andrew Robertson (HULL CITY vs Crystal Palace) - 8

Another Hull player deservedly in the team of the week, Robertson is turning into one of the best signings of the summer. He was swinging in accurate crosses all afternoon and made one of them count when Diame headed in the Tigers' opener. Another impressive afternoon for the young Scot.

FWD - Sergio Aguero (MANCHESTER CITY vs Aston Villa) - 7.5

A menace for Villa all afternoon, the only surprise was that it took Aguero 88 minutes to score. He hit the post shortly after the break and created openings for others. His effort late on, which doubled City's advantage, fizzed past Guzan from the edge of the box and took his season's tally to six goals.

FWD - Papiss Cisse (NEWCASTLE UNITED vs Swansea City) - 8

After a tough 2013-2014, in which he suffered from injuries, Cisse looks somewhere near his best and took his season's tally to four in three matches with a double to earn Newcastle a draw at Swansea. His first, Newcastle's first away goal in 763 minutes, was a glanced finish across Lukasz Fabianski, his second a poked goal after he found space between the defenders.
