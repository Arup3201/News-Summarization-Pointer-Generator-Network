A massive air and sea search has been launched off the coast of New South Wales for a man and a woman believed to have fallen overboard from a luxury cruise liner.

Paul Rossington, 30 and Kristen Schroder, 27 were discovered missing when the Carnival Spirit liner arrived in Sydney today.

The alarm was raised when the couple did not disembark and a search of the ship failed to find them.

Investigation: Two police officers check for fingerprints on the balcony of the cabin of two passengers who fell overboard from the cuise ship Carnival Spirit as it returned to Sydney from a Pacific cruise

Search: Police arrive at Sydney's Circular Quay - the alarm was raised when the couple did not disembark and a search of the ship failed to find them

Marine Area Commander Mark Hutchings said did not rule out the possibility of a suicide pact.

'I've been a detective all my career. I actually deal with evidence, and I rule nothing out,' he said. 'It's very raw at the moment and we are talking to relatives.'

The missing passengers were last seen on the deck of the 
ship during Wednesday evening, some 12 hours before they were reported 
missing, as the vessel came to the end of its 10-day 
voyage.

Police revealed later that the ship's CCTV cameras had captured images of the couple falling overboard.

No further details of exactly what the images show were 
immediately available but NSW Marine Police inspector Mark Hutchings 
said search and rescue authorities were still holding out hope the pair 
would be found alive.

'This is a tragic event at the moment, but we're holding
out hope we might be able to find these people alive,' he said.

The search is concentrating on the waters between Sydney and Newcastle, 100 miles to the north of the harbour city.

It is believed the US registered ship, which is currently based in Australia, has just returned from sailing through the Pacific, visiting the islands of Fiji and New Zealand.

Mr Peter Taylor, a spokesman for Carnival Cruise Lines, said the couple were travelling with their family and friends.

When they were found to be missing, he said, ''the ship immediately initiated standard missing person procedures, including a full search of the vessel, as per protocol.'

Luxury: The 959ft, 88,500 ton vessel was launched in 2001 and is described by passengers as a 'floating holiday resort'

Miss Jo Meehan, spokeswoman for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which is co-ordinating the search, said an aircraft, a helicopter and police boats were searching a 300-square nautical mile area of the sea north of Sydney.

Carnival Cruise is a subsidiary of Miami-based Carnival Corp., the world's largest cruise operator.

The company is reported to have been plagued by a series of high-profile problems in recent years, the most major of which was the grounding of the Costa Concordia which ran aground off the coast of Italy last year killing 32 people.

Costa is a division of Carnival Corp and also last year, the Costa Allegra caught fire and lost power in the Indian Ocean, leaving passengers working working toilets, running water or air conditioning for three days.

In February this year the Carnival Triumph spent five days without power in the Gulf of Mexico after an engine-room fire put the vessel out of action.

The 959ft, 88,500 ton vessel was launched in 2001 and is described by passengers as a 'floating holiday resort'.

Its
website describes it as having a 'host of areas for outdoor fun, 
including a corkscrew water slide, four swimming pools, a miniature golf
course, jogging track and a sport court.

Passengers have a choice of 16 lounges and bars, including a three-deck-high theatre with 1,170 seats.

There is a reservations-only steakhouse and a large poolside restaurant.

Before
being based in Australia, the ship's destinations included the Bahamas,
Hawaii, the eastern Mediterranean and the Mexican Riviera.

The vessel is so large that it cannot fit under the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge.
