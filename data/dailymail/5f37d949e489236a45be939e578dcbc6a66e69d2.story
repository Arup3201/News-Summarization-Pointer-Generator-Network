The mother of a young woman who was stabbed to death in front of her 26 day old baby has joined forces with the parents of another victim to call for a 'stalkers list' to prevent similar murders. 

Pamela Dabney, 60, believes her daughter Kirsty Treloar, 20, could have been saved from the brutal hands of her former boyfriend had there been a list warning her of his violent past. 

Miss Treloar was stabbed 29 times after Myles Williams, 19, broke into her home in Hackney in east London on New Year's Day in 2012. Hours earlier he had sent the young mother a text promising not to hit her again. 

Mrs Dabney has joined forces with John Clough whose daughter Jane died in 2010 after she was stabbed 71 times by her abusive partner in Blackpool. 

Kirsty Treloar, 20, (left) was stabbed by her former partner Myles Williams in front of her 26-day old baby (right) and then murdered. Her mother Pamela Dabney is calling for a stalkers list so there is an accessible record of people who have a history of violence, which she believes could have saved her daughter

The pair have collected more than 100,000 signatures on an online petition calling for a stalkers register, which will be similar to the sex offenders register and allow people to look up the past of their partners if they suspect them of being violent. 

They refer to stalkers as 'insidious' and call on Theresa May to make the law a reality. In the description of the online petition they wrote: 'Our daughters could have been saved if their serial abusers were on a register and being managed and monitored.' 

Mrs Dabney, a nurse, said: 'Kirsty was terrified of Myles and I was so desperate that I asked for help from every avenue. After her death, we found out in court that Myles beat up his ex-girlfriend, smashed her doors in, kicked and threatened her, all when she was five months pregnant.

'All this came out in court but nothing was told to me the numerous times I went to the police. No one communicated with us, the police knew his record but didn't bother telling us and this is why I have set up this stalkers register. If it can save one girl's life, I will be happy.'

Miss Treloar met Williams, who has two other children from previous relationships, in December 2010. Soon after, her mother noticed he was very controlling over her daughter and would even accompany her into the bathroom.

When Kirsty fell pregnant in April 2011, Williams became even more possessive.

More than 100,000 people have signed the petition created by Mr Clough and Mrs Dabney calling for a register for people with a history of stalking or domestic violence, similar to that available for sex offenders

Mrs Dabney noticed bruises round her daughter's neck and went to the police when Williams would not allow her to see her daughter. 

She said: 'I noticed that when Myles came round I would never see Kirsty. He would lock her bedroom door from the inside and I wouldn't see them for hours, sometimes not at all.

'It got worse when Kirsty became pregnant, she started wearing a lot of makeup covering her face, looked so pale and was always exhausted.

'They left to go for a baby scan and then I didn't see or hear from Kirsty for three weeks. It was so unlike her, she was always in touch with me and her brother and sister. Then she turned up at the hospital where I worked with bruises on her neck. She wouldn't tell me what they were from but I suspected Myles so I went to the police station and told them I thought Myles was abusing Kirsty.

Dean and Gemma Treloar were also stabbed when they tried to protect their sister from Williams 

'The police looked his name up and said that he was known to the police but I was too worried for Kirsty to ask anything further.

'I didn't know where he lived but I heard the police went round to his house and had a word but I still didn't hear anything from Kirsty for months after that.'

When she was seven months pregnant Miss Treloar moved back in with her parents in October 2011 and gave birth two months later. Williams would regularly turn up at the house, despite being told the relationship was over. 

On New Year's Day he sent her a text promising not to hit her again. 

He wrote: 'Okay wer all gud now and my new yrs ressy is that i aint going to hit u again and i won't hit u 4 this yr next yr the yr after that the next yr after that.'

It ended: 'But I wont u to swear on (their daughter's) life u wont p.ss me off and do things to make me angry love you 4 eva.'

Miss Treloar responded that she did not want to see him so the next day Williams broke into her home, despite being on bail for a previous attack on her. He stabbed his former girlfriend 29 times and also attacked her brother Dean, 25 and her sister Gemma, 27, with the knife when they tried to stop him. 

Despite protests from her family Williams dragged Miss Treloar from the flat saying she deserved to die.  He shoved her into his car and the next day dumped her in an alleyway next to some bins. 

He was jailed for life for the murder and will serve a minimum of 28 years in prison.  

Their baby is now being cared for by Mrs Dabney, who will one day be forced to explain to the little girl that her mother was killed by her father. 

She added: 'Even though Kirsty was only a mum for 26 days, she was a natural.

Jane Clough was also killed by an abusive partner, Jonathan Vass, and her father is calling for the register

'She doted on that little girl and was so gentle with her. Every morning without fail, she'd get up at 6am for feeding and adored putting her in pretty little dresses.

'It's an absolute tragedy that she won't be here to bring her beautiful daughter up and I'll never forgive Myles for what he's done to this family.

'This campaign is a tribute to my daughter. I know that Kirsty would have a better chance of survival if a stalkers' register was in place. It would help a lot of men and women who suffer abuse at the hands of their partners.

'Had I known about Myles' past, I would have done more to keep him away. If I can save just one person's life because of the stalker's register I know it will all be worth it.'

Mrs Dabney and Mr Clough have set up the petition called 'Create a Stalker's Register', on Change.org. 

The pair wrote: 'Stalking is a crime that is insidious and terrifying and yet many still do not understand it. Stalkers steal lives and take lives.'

Jane Clough was stabbed 71 times by her former partner Jonathan Vass when she turned up to work at night shift at Blackpool Victoria Hospital. As the young mother and nurse lay on the floor bleeding Vass slit her throat. 

The 26-year-old had chillingly foretold her death in a diary where she wrote of her fears that Vass would kill her, after subjecting her to a campaign of abuse. She reported him to the police for raping and assaulting her but Vass, a 31-year-old ambulance technician, was arrested and released on bail - giving him time to plot his revenge and attack the young nurse. 

She wrote repeatedly about fearing he would come and get her but it was only when she returned back to work part time in July 2010 that he was lying in wait for her and attacked her. 

He was sentenced to life in prison for the murder and will serve a minimum of 30 years in prison.  

Mr Clough and Mrs Dabney both describe people with a history of domestic violence as just as dangerous as sex offenders. 

They added: We need to act now to save lives by protecting women from serial stalkers and domestic violence perpetrators by introducing a register which would help police to pro-actively identify, track, monitor and manage stalkers instead of relying on a series of victims to report multiple crimes'
