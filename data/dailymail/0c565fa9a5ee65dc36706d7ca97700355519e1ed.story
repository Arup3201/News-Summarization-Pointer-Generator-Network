The bus driver was caught on camera using a mobile phone while driving the vehicle full of passengers through Sheffield

A bus driver has been fired after he was caught on camera talking on his mobile phone for several minutes while in control of his vehicle.

The driver had only one hand on the steering wheel for most of the journey - but at times he took both hands off the wheel while waving at other motorists or scratching his head.

After passenger Anna Williams, a young mother travelling with her two children, handed mobile phone footage of the incident to the bus operator, the reckless driver was sacked.

During the journey through Sheffield, the driver - who has not been named - negotiated busy rounabouts and skirted past parked cars while talking on the phone.

When he stopped the bus to let Ms Williams off, she told him that she had captured the whole journey on the phone, and promptly sent the video to TM Travel, the company which runs the bus route.

'Sometimes he didn't even have his hands on the wheel,' she said. 'He was scratching his head and driving along, opening his window and putting his hand out to say thank you to other drivers.

'He just had no concern at all for the public or anyone he was carrying on the bus.

'I expected him to end the call before he started the journey. He didn't - he just carried on driving off along the road on his phone.

'I didn't know whether to say anything, whether to get up but he would have already committed the act of driving the bus while using his phone, knowing he shouldn't be doing that .

'He was 
chatting away having a good old conversation. I wasn't making any 
attempt to hide the fact that I was recording him, and I did speak while
 I was recording it.

'It went on for a good five or six minutes. There was only me and my son and my baby on the bus. My baby had only broken his leg a week before and he was on the bus with a plaster cast in the pushchair.

'He travelled at 30 mph - it's a bit of a rough bus journey to start off with, without being on your mobile phone!'

Ms Williams said she felt powerless to challenge him, but realised she had to let the company know how the driver had behaved.

'I phoned the bus company up straight away as soon as I got to my destination,' she said.

'Obviously they said they weren't very happy about it and so they said he would be suspended pending further investigations.

'I understand he has now lost his job. I am satisfied with that, but to be honest I think it should be referred to the police because it is a criminal matter.'

Phil Stockley, the general manager of TM Travel, said he was 'shocked and upset' to be handed the footage.

'We were extremely shocked and upset to see one of our drivers behaving in that fashion,' he said.

'We pride ourselves on employing highly professional, very skilled drivers and they, in turn, like to set a good standard and a good image for their profession. We are all very upset to think that any of our staff would behave in that way.

'Clearly the driver has done something he shouldn't do and he has been dealt with accordingly. He no longer works for us.

'The vast majority of bus drivers do a professional job - they are very highly conscientious, they want to provide a good service to the public, they want to comply with all the relevant rules and regulations.'
