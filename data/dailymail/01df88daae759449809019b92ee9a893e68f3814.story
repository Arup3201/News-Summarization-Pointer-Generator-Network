The High Court judge leading the BBC’s Jimmy Savile inquiry has been urged to question former director general Mark Thompson over whether he knew of rumours about the late DJ’s behaviour a decade ago.

Mr Thompson has repeatedly claimed that during his 30 years at the Corporation he was never aware of allegations that Savile was a paedophile. This was despite the issue being raised in a Louis Theroux documentary broadcast by the BBC in 2000.

Now Tory MP Rob Wilson has written to judge Dame Janet Smith saying Mr Thompson should be interviewed for ‘public interest’ reasons. Mr Thompson was Director of BBC Television when the BBC2 documentary ‘When Louis Met .  .  . Jimmy’ was screened 14 years ago.

During the film – watched by four million viewers – journalist Mr Theroux tackled Savile over allegations that he had an unhealthy interest in children.

Mr Wilson writes: ‘It’s unlikely the programme escaped Mr Thompson’s attention .  .  . I also consider it is implausible the BBC would not have taken legal advice before putting the allegations of paedophilia to Savile. This .  .  . would have been referred up to the highest levels of senior management.’

Mr Thompson said in a letter to Mr Wilson that while some people claimed to have known about the allegations: ‘I never heard them or indeed any allegations of anything either criminal or anti-social that he was said to have done.’

A spokesman for the Dame Janet Smith review declined to comment. A BBC spokesman said: ‘It is for the independent review to decide who they speak to.’
