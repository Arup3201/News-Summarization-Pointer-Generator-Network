When it comes to sport, former world number one tennis star Caroline Wozniacki is used to taking centre stage.

But the 22-year-old was happy to take on the role of cheerleader today to support her golfer boyfriend Rory McIlroy during the second round of the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai.

The Danish athlete, who was accompanied by Rory's father Gerry McIlroy, brought a touch of glamour to the greens in a tight grey mini-dress with sheer black panels.

World number one McIlroy, 23, is in a three-way tie for the lead in Dubai with Luke Donald and Marc Warren.

The Northern Ireland native has bounced back after being diagnosed with a sickness bug on Thursday night.

McIlroy defied the overnight bout of illness to post a 67 for an 11-under-par total of 133 today.

His recovery was put down to a cup of lemon tea from Miss Wozniacki.

The golfer's girlfriend continued to display her devotion today, chatting to her boyfriend's father as they walked the fairways at the Jumeirah Golf Estates.
