A boisterous Cambridge student gets a public lecture from an irate university official - after he got showered in flour and champagne.

Senior proctor Dr Owen Saxton laid down the law as undergraduates spilled onto the streets yesterday to celebrate end-of-term exams.

He was seen marching over to a group of students and jabbing his finger as he gave one young man a dressing down.

Groups of them poured into nearby shops to snap up champagne which they then sprayed over each other in the street.

Others hurled flour - but some of it landed on the black gown and mortar board of the diminutive proctor.

Another male student received a public telling off for spraying his £8 bottle of Sainsbury's Montoya Cava over his undergraduate friends.

Others students were seen buying £42 bottles of Bollinger which they sprayed over each other on Jesus Green.

A 28-year-old mother living near the city centre park said: 'I saw at least 10 with Bollinger and more with cheaper fizzy wine and Cava.

'Maybe Bollinger was on special offer as they were all going mad for it. They were pretty rowdy.'

The university banned over-the-top celebrations last year in a bid to retain an air of calm for students still studying and sitting exams.

Proctors are among the most ancient officers of Cambridge University who oversee exams and student discipline, among other duties.

Dr Saxton won the 1996 Ernst Ruska Prize, awarded every four years for the greatest contribution to electron microscopy in Europe.

He has taught Physics at Murray Edwards College since 1975 - as a Fellow since 1983, and as Director of Studies since 1990.

He was also the College's Admissions Tutor for two years and its Senior Tutor for seven; a Tutor for fifteen years, and the Praelector for as long.

He will be one of the University Proctors 2012-13.
