Two business partners have been jailed for  conning companies out of £1 million by using scams including a 'cash for crash' scheme, counterfeit insurance certificates and mortgage fraud.

Amjed Iqbal, 35, and Shakir Javid  36, from Fenham, Newcastle pleaded guilty to charges for their accident claims company at Newcastle Crown Court. 

Their business Accident and Claims Specialists (ACS) targeted taxis and owned several licensed taxis which they would hire to taxi drivers whose cars were off the road.

Iqbal and Javid made thousands from insurance companies by making up accidents and costs.

Newcastle Crown Court heard that between 2006 and 2009, they made 34 false claims, amounting to £194,000.

It was not until Arriva Buses became suspicious about a claim they made that police investigated them.

Prosecutor Michael Graham said: 'In some claims, there is evidence that no accident took place at all, in others sums have been claimed for recovery, storage or hire when this did not take place or otherwise, figures have been inflated.'

They also provided a number of taxi drivers with fake insurance certificates, leaving them uninsured.

Police found some of the taxis had even been registered as hired to more than one person at the same time.

In all 38 forged insurance documents were recovered from their Newcastle offices, most of which had been lodged by unsuspecting taxi drivers.

Officers discovered that Iqbal and Javid had also lined their pockets with mortgage frauds.

Javid obtained 11 mortgage advances with £919,496 by using his wife's name and making false declarations about his income.

Iqbal also took out a mortgage worth £139,749 for a property, claiming he and his wife were earning almost £60,000 a year,  when he had only declared an income of £1,444 to the taxman.

Taxi driver Zafar Hussain, 33, from Newcastle, also pleaded guilty to fraud for a claim where he arranged to crash two cars into each other.

An insurance company were defrauded of almost £14,000 after the details of an unsuspecting member of the public were used to make the false claim. Hussain was fined £800.

In 2009 Iqbal was shot in the leg at a house in Ponteland when he was targeted by masked gunmen.

Javid and another man were initially accused of the attack, however charges were later dropped.

Iqbal underwent two operations to remove 50 pellets embedded in his leg.

After the shooting, Javid ran ACS from new premises while Iqbal stayed at the old shop running a rival business.

Andrew Rutter, the lawyer who was defending Iqbal, said: 'He is vulnerable physically, part of his arm is missing and he now has a cage around his leg. He is a devoted family man and devout religiously.'

Robin Patton, acting for Javid, said: 'There is a good side to him, he has tried to help others who are less fortunate. He will disgrace his family by going to prison and will not be able to assist his father, who he looks after.'

Iqbal has been jailed for two years and four months and Javid for three years.
