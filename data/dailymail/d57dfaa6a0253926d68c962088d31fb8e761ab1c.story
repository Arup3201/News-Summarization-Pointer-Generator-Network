An Arizona man has murdered his four neighbors and killed their two dogs because the canines wouldn't stop barking loudly, police have revealed.

Michael Dante Guzzo, 56, became enraged over the noise from the pets at a neighboring townhouse in a Phoenix apartment complex on Saturday, detectives say.

They believe he used a pump-action shotgun to shoot dead Bruce Moore, 66; his daughter, Renee Moore, 36; her husband Michael Moore, 42; and their son, Shannon Moore, 17. He also slaughtered their dogs.

Heavy response: Phoenix SWAT police stormed Michael Dante Guzzo's apartment following the rampage - only to find him dead by his own hand

Guzzo then fired several rounds into the door of another neighbor.

He returned home and killed himself.

Several of Guzzo's neighbors say he was a quiet man who had lived alone in the community for several years.

They were shocked by his sudden violent rampage.

'I've seen him every morning - come in quiet every morning,' Donald McKenzie told KSAZ-TV.

'Never would expect him to be the guy who did this at all.'

Police say they may never know for certain what prompted the massacre because Guzzo took his own life.

Neighbors say they were shocked that Guzzo - a quiet man who lived alone - was capable of such violence

However, they believe the altercation was the result of an argument over the Moores' dogs.

Renee Moore ran a dog grooming business.

Police found two of Guzzo's victims on the patio outside their townhouse. Two others were shot dead inside the home.

Witnesses described watching Guzzo stroll through the complex with his shotgun after the killings.

'When I walked outside, I saw a middle aged gentleman with a big shotgun in his hand,' Barry Hatchett told KNXV-TV.

'Had it thrown over his shoulder actually. And then he spoke to someone across the way. And what he said was, "You didnâ€™t think I seen you home boy?" Then he pumped the gun and he shot it.'

Libni DeLeon said the gunman knocked then fired two shots through the door. His front door is peppered with holes from the shotgun blast. Libni was not injured.

SWAT teams surrounded Guzzo's apartment Saturday and pulled off a steeling security door before entering and finding him dead.
