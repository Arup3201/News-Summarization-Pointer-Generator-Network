Ajax manager Frank De Boer will hold talks with Tottenham about becoming their next manager - and he could bring Arsenal legend Dennis Bergkamp with him to White Hart Lane.

Spurs have begun identifying candidates to replace current boss Tim Sherwood, who is set to leave this summer.

De Boer is a favourite among the Tottenham hierarchy, and speaking on Dutch TV On Tuesday the Holland legend confirmed the Barclays Premier League club’s interest.

Tottenham’s intention to discuss the managerial role with De Boer was made directly to Ajax director of football Marc Overmars.

Approach: Ajax boss Frank de Boer will wait to the end of the season to talk to Tottenham Hotspur

‘Spurs haven’t had contact with my agent yet. They have approached Ajax, but that’s it,’ said De Boer.

‘Spurs have let Ajax know they would eventually talk to me when the season’s finished.

‘After the last league game (against NEC on Saturday) I’ll think about it,’ said De Boer.  

‘I’ll
 talk to them and listen to what they have to say. I would like to add 
something to a club like Brendan Rodgers did at Liverpool.

‘I see a perspective at Tottenham Hotspur, just as Liverpool and Newcastle United sometimes are, they are sleeping giants.’

Tottenham’s interest in De Boer brings up the sensational possibility of Bergkamp joining his colleague in north London.

The
 44-year-old is currently De Boer’s assistant at the Amsterdam Arena, 
with the pair forming a strong working relationship; winning three 
consecutive Eredivisie titles together.

Hot seat: Spurs boss Tim Sherwood's current deal has him in charge until the end of the 2014-15 season

Success: De Boer says Tottenham could be a 'sleeping giant' of a club, like Liverpool and Newcastle

Influence: De Boer believes he can emulate the kind of success Brendan Rodgers has had at Liverpool

Should
 he end up at Tottenham, it is understood De Boer is keen on continuing 
his partnership with Bergkamp but realises the delicate nature of his 
countryman’s sitaution.

Bergkamp,
 who made 417 appearances for the Gunners, is still revered in the red 
half of north London and even has a statue outside the Emirates Stadium.

The
 former Holland forward still has huge affection for Arsenal, while 
members of the club’s hierarchy have earmarked Bergkamp as a possible 
future Gunners boss.

Big ask: Bergkamp's emotional and historical ties to Arsenal make it unlikely he'll go to Tottenham

And given his emotional ties with Arsenal, it seems highly unlikely Bergkamp would agree to join bitter rivals Tottenham.

Realising
 the special circumstances, it is believed De Boer would look to bring 
Hennie Spijkerman - who also works under him at Ajax - with him to 
Spurs.

Tottenham were non-committal with regards to De Boer’s claims, which have cast more doubt on Sherwood’s position as head coach.

De Boer was last night installed as the new bookmakers favourite to land the Spurs job.

However, Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino remains a strong contender according to Tottenham sources.

The
 Argentine is well thought of within the corridors of power at Tottenham
 and, despite the approach for De Boer, remains a challenger for the 
post.

Meanwhile, Tottenham 
legend Glenn Hoddle has ruled himself out of replacing Sherwood and also
 taken a dig at the current Spurs boss.

Sherwood identified Hoddle as one of the managers touting himself to take over at White Hart Lane.

Return? Glenn Hoddle has been linked with a comeback as the Spurs manager

But
 the former England boss said: ‘I have seen that I am the favourite for
 this job, that job, virtually every job. That I am ready, that I am 
desperate to get back into management, that I am touting for this or 
that job.

‘But I am not. I 
am not applying. Tim Sherwood must obviously feel under pressure to take
 what has happened and what has been in the public domain for some time 
now and choose to interpret that as me touting for his job.

‘The
 truth of the matter is vastly different, and I can imagine by naming me
 he is deflecting attention from himself, which is fair enough -  
managers do it all the time.’
