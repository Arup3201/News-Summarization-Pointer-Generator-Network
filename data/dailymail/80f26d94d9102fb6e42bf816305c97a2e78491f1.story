West Ham's Olympic Stadium conversion could include the seating in both main stands rearranged to include two large crossed hammers.

The plan is likely to see most of the black seats currently fixed in the stadium changed to white, with the exception of several hundred black seats that are likely to be rearranged to create the two club crests ahead of the Hammers moving into their new home in 2016.

Details of the plan emerged at a stakeholder’s meeting at the club, where the ongoing stadium transformation work was discussed.

For the 2012 Olympic Games the seats were arranged into a black and white Olympic ‘fragment’ pattern, but stadium officials are understood to be open to the change in a bid to make the stadium acceptable for West Ham fans.

The West Ham Board are eager to consider every avenue to make the stadium feel like home for fans and it is also understood that the club and stadium chiefs London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) have not ruled out recolouring some or all of the stadium seats to the club’s claret and blue colours.

A source close to the stadium confirmed that the option of recolouring the seats remained a possibility, but that talks were ongoing.

LLDC have a full approach to sustainability and if they decide that some or all of the black seats wouldn’t be used, there are a number of options available to them including selling or relocating the seats.

West Ham confirmed a new club badge over the summer, which will come into use as of 2016.

West Ham have also explored the possibility of erecting a statue of World Cup-winning former captain Bobby Moore at the Olympic Stadium, while all names and messages on the commemorative bricks at the Boleyn Ground will be transferred to the Olympic Stadium.

Other key elements of the club's history are likely to travel to the new stadium, including the commemorative plaques for blub legends and the West Ham Pals Battalion from the First World War.

Work is currently under way on the new stadium roof and retractable seating to cover the running track so West Ham can use the stadium.

The original stadium, which was designed as a largely temporary venue and never intended to host Premier League football, cost £429million to build, with the conversion costing a further £154m. However recent reports have suggested these costs may need to rise another £15m in order to complete the project.
