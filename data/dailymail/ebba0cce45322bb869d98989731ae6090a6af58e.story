One of the 'naive and impressionable' teenage boys who was stopped in Turkey as he tried to join ISIS had written cruel jibes about the murder of soldier Lee Rigby on social media, it has emerged.

The 17-year-old boy, an A-grade student from Brent, north west London, was stopped at Sabiha Gökçen International Airport in Istanbul with his 17-year-old cousin and another 19-year-old man on Saturday.

It has now been revealed that prior to him fleeing Britain, he made comments on social media criticising the 'eruption' of public grief over the Islamist murder of solder Rigby, who was brutally killed near the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, south east London in May 2013.

The sixth form student also spoke online about 'not being able to recognise' himself from the person he had been a year earlier.

A friend of the boy has now spoken about his fears that the teenager was radicalised by an older pupil at the school.

The source told The Sun: 'His radical views were well known. He fell in with a boy and was influenced by his extreme views.

'He was extremely bright and wanted to go to university to study engineering.

'On Friday when he went missing, he told people he was going to prayers. His parents were distraught.'

It is understood that one of the teenagers attended Preston Manor School in Wembley, where students were recently told that weekly prayer sessions must be taken only in English amid fears of radicalisation.

Pupils claimed that as part of the new requirements, a teacher must also be present at all times during prayers.

The three teenagers, who have not been named, were intercepted by officials after the shocked families of the younger boys learned of their plans and quickly alerted police, who waited at the airport as the flight landed from Barcelona, Spain.

The teens, all from Brent, north west London, were stopped at Sabiha Gökçen International Airport in Istanbul when an officer checked their passports  and ordered for them to be taken to a 'risk and analysis' centre

It is believed they travelled from mainland Spain to try and dodge being caught. However, they were stopped as they went through passport control at the Turkish airport after landing at about 11pm on Saturday.

CCTV footage shows an immigration officer checking the passports of each of the teenage boys before telling them they will not be able to proceed to the arrivals hall. They are then escorted to a 'risk and analysis centre' in the airport by officials.

All three teenagers were later put on a return flight to London and taken into custody at a high-security police station for questioning.

They have since been released on bail after being quizzed by counter-terror officers on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism.

Yesterday, it emerged that one of the boys had asked the council when he could return to school.

The two younger teenage boys were at a meeting with Muhammed Butt, the leader of Brent Council, when the question arose.

Muhammed Butt, the leader of Brent Council, spoke to the teenagers and their families this week and does not believe they were radicalised but 'naive'

Mr Butt told Channel 4 News: 'One of them was saying to me "when can I go back to school?"

'I said to him I think you have to wait a little bit longer to let things settle down and we can work with the school and everyone else and make sure things are right for you to go back.'

Mr Butt, who met with the teenagers and their families, said both of the boys had been behaving normally prior to disappearing.

He said: 'The children had no conversations about any kind of radical speak or anything else, the conversations were absolutely normal.

'One of the boys had a conversation with his father the night before and the father had asked him do you want some pocket money?

'The father gave him £20 and the child gave him £10 back. If someone is preparing to go somewhere I think you would take as much money with you as possible. And for him to give £10 back doesn't suggest he had anything prepared or was going to do anything wrong.'

The politician said he believed that they had been 'caught up in emotions' rather than radicalised and were 'naive' teenagers who had made a mistake and were relieved to come home.

He said: 'Personally I don't think they had been radicalised, absolutely not. I think what they've done is they've been caught up in emotions as such.

'They were looking for a platform to speak up or to say something and they haven't found a space or a platform where they can have a grown up conversation about events in Syria.

'I met with the two boys. I met with the two families as well and you could not meet a more normal family. The two young kids they are grade A students and both of them have aspirations, one to be an engineer and one to be a doctor.

'It just beggars belief these guys got caught up in their own thinking as such, of trying to go out there and do some good. All they've said from the conversations I have with them is that they wanted to go out there and help.'

In light of the recent claims that one of the boys held extremist views before fleeing the country, Mr Butt issued a fresh statement today in which he said: 'Our conversations with the children point to them both being remorseful for the pain and anguish they have caused their families and the local community. 

'Every parent will recognise that children, in their teenage years, can be naïve and they will make mistakes.

'Brent Council is fully focused on working with the families and our partners to ensure these children get the support and guidance they need.'

It came as the 'devastated' families of the boys said they couldn't 'thank the police and Turkish authorities enough' for getting them home safely.

Mr Butt said: 'They are just normal kids with aspirations like any other kids and their families would do anything to support them and they will continue to support them to make sure they become an engineer or a doctor.

'They are 17-years-old, they are young and naive and they are learning as they go through life.

The three British teenagers who were stopped in Turkey were allegedly on their way to Syria to join ISIS. Istanbul has become a well-known stop off point for British jihadis wanting to flee to join terrorist in Syria

'The families are overjoyed to have their children back. You have to bear in mind they're still schoolchildren, still studying for their A-levels, and the families were absolutely devastated to find that the children had disappeared and then to find that they were on their way to Istanbul - the family are still in shock.

'The families are just normal, decent, hard-working families - just a normal next door family. You would have thought no different of them on Friday than you would do today, I am sure.'

He said the boys now want to get back to normal, adding: 'They just want to go back to school and continue their studies.

'They made a mistake and they just want to get back to normal, so that's what we're going to do as a council help them get back on track.'

Mr Butt said the families contacted the police on Friday morning as soon as they realised their boys were missing.

The three teenagers were stopped in Istanbul in a dramatic security operation after British police tipped off their Turkish counterparts.

Officials swooped on the group within minutes of their flight touching down in Istanbul and the trio were brought back to Britain where they were questioned at a high-security London police station on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism.

Sources in Turkey said there is some evidence the three communicated with terrorists about how best to evade the authorities but none of them are believed to be connected to any high-profile ISIS terrorists.

The two 17-year-old boys, along with a 19-year-old man, all from north-west London, were detained in Istanbul, Turkey, the Met Police said. They are believed to have been travelling to join ISIS (file picture)

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'They have been bailed to return to a central London police station pending further inquiries.'

Investigators now hope to discover how they planned to reach the war zone and why they decided to try to do so.

More than 600 Britons have fled Britain for Syria and Iraq since the appalling explosion of violence in the region began.

They include 22 women and girls who have travelled in the past 12 months, many of whom wanted to become 'jihadi brides'.

ISIS controls huge areas of the two countries and has attracted thousands of foreign fighters to its cause.

Turkey has faced criticism for not controlling its border with Syria, but has accused European states of failing to prevent would-be jihadists from leaving in the first place.

MailOnline has contacted Brent Council and Preston Manor School for comment.
