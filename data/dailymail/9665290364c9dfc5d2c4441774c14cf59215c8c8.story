Kevin Gough, 43, died inside this chimney stack after becoming trapped at the bottom and not being able to breathe

A burglar who was found dead in a chimney at a solicitor’s office suffocated to death 'within minutes', his family was told today.

Kevin Gough, 43, died in 'very unusual' and 'very tragic circumstances' when he got stuck inside the chimney stack at Moody & Woolley Solicitors in Derby, an inquest into his death heard.

Derby and South Derbyshire coroner Robert Hunter said Mr Gough, whose chest was compressed by the narrow chimney stack, would have lost consciousness quickly, meaning he would not have been able to call for help for long.

The serial burglar's body was discovered inside the chimney at Moody & Woolley Solicitors in St Mary’s Gate, Derby, on 1 May after staff noticed an unpleasant smell and called in a pest control firm.

Mr Gough had not been seen since 15 March when he had breakfast at a charity for homeless people, the inquest was told.

Derby and South Derbyshire Coroner’s Court heard that police were called and officers found Mr Gough’s badly decomposed body stuck inside the chimney.

A post-mortem found he had brick marks across his back and chest from being squashed inside such a space so confined, his chest would not have been able to expand when he breathed.

The coroner said Mr Gough's T-shirt had been pulled up around his neck and this would also have constricted his airway.

The inquest was told that the chimney breast and fireplace had been completely bricked up from the inside, while a piece of Mr Gough's clothing was blocking the top, meaning there was no oxygen coming in.

Mr Gough, whose last address had been St Helens, Merseyside, and who had served time in prison for a string of burglary convictions, was identified from his fingerprints.  The coroner found his death was caused by postural asphyxiation.

Dr Hunter told Mr Gough’s mother, who was at the inquest with other family members, that her son would have passed out quickly.

'There would have been a rapid loss of consciousness,' he said, 'and death within a manner of minutes.

'This would be why he did not call for help and the people working within the building had not heard him.'

Recording a verdict of misadventure, Dr Hunter said methadone had been 
found in Mr Gough’s liver but not enough to have caused 
his death.

He said: 'He had gone to that premises and had entered that chimney.  What he would not know is that the chimney had been blocked up.'

 'His death would have been very, very quick - he would not have lingered in the chimney for two or three days.'

Dr Hunter said Mr Gough would probably have realised there was no way out when he got to the bottom, and he had got stuck.

'His death would have been very, very quick.' he said.

'He would not have lingered in the chimney for two or three days.  It’s a little bit of comfort, not a great comfort, I’m sure you’d prefer to have him alive and well.'

The coroner said it was not clear why Mr Gough had gone into the chimney but he was satisfied he had made his way in there of his own accord and nobody else had been involved.

Detective Constable Tom Bentley, of Derbyshire Police, told the inquest Mr Gough had been arrested on 13 March because he was found to be in possession of prescribed medication that was not in his own name.

He was also wanted in connection with a burglary at a business nearby.

Mr Gough, who was unemployed but had in the past worked as a blind manufacturer, was subsequently released from police custody and last seen alive two days later.
