No time to make friends? Now you can hire then online

Feeling lonely? Fancy a natter about your day? For the price of a bottle of wine you can now hire someone to be your friend. You may think it sounds like the ultimate in desperation, but over half a million members of rentafrined.com would disagree.

With Britain’s single-person households at 9.5 million and growing, it’s no wonder the friendship website, originally launched in the US, is gaining traction in the UK.

The site facilitates connections between members and friends. For $24.95 per month (£15) members have hundreds and thousands of potential friends at their fingertips. ‘Friends’ create a Facebook-esque profile for free and charge members between £5-30 for the privilege of their company.

The website clearly states no physical contact is allowed between any members and friends.

In the UK alone there are 26,000 users with and over half a million other members in almost every country round the globe.

The
 platonic friendship business is also booming in Brazil, Canada and the 
US. And unsurprisingly big cities like London and Chicago are hubs of 
rental activity.

Members
 choose a friend by pursuing the many profiles, where the friends 
describe themselves and post pictures, and then send their preferred companion a message. The friend then decides whether they want to meet the member and hence the platonic liaison begins.

The
 website boasts that people are using rentafriend.com for all kinds of 
activities including shopping, going to the park, sharing poetry, 
sightseeing, baking and even finding a wingman or woman to help pick up a date.

The site is also used by the elderly or people whose disabilities impinge on their social lives, who are looking for company.

Mainly
 though, it’s just about hanging out. Thirty-two-year-old Ellie Coden, 
one of the site’s friends up for hire, recently told the The Times 
newspaper: ‘I can see why it’s popular because it’s so hard to meet 
people in London and English people are really awkward.’

The website states that no physical contact between members and friends is allowed but suggests 'hanging out' and 'sightseeing' as potential activities

The
 Italian-born ‘friend’, who charges herself out at £20 an hour adds: ‘If
 I get on well with someone and they become a friend, I wouldn’t ask to 
be paid.’

The friendship concept started in Japan, where it catered to divorced or widowed parents looking for fake spouses to hire for social occasions.

The idea caught the attention of Scott Rosenbaum from Stewartsville New Jersey, who saw the potential for the rent a friend concept elsewhere in the world.

‘Family structure is a very big part of society in Japan, and the companies were offering “fill in” family members,’ explains Rosenbaum.

‘If there was a divorce, death, or situation in which a parent was not available, one could hire someone to pretend to be that family member.

‘If a child had a school activity in which the parents needed to attend, it was common for a single parent to hire a spouse to fill in for the school event.

‘After reading about the companies in Japan, I realized that there weren't any companies that were catering to the friend market elsewhere.’

‘There were thousands of dating websites, but no websites where you could hire a local platonic friend,’ he adds.

After doing some market research, Scott realised the potential for the untapped market.
