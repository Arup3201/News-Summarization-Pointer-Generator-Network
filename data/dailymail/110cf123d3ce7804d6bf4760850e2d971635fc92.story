Former president: Edwin 'Kevin' De Boer, 26, has been charged with sexually assaulting a young woman for the second time in three years

A former fraternity president has been charged with drugging and raping a woman in his second sex assault charge in just three years.

Prosecutors say Edwin 'Kevin' De Boer, 26, spiked a woman's drink with a sedative during a date last November before taking her back to his apartment in Federal Way, Washington and having his way with her.

Three years ago in 2009 De Boer was similarly accused of raping a woman at a University of Washington fraternity house where he was president, a charge he struck a plea deal with to spare him from registering as a sex offender.

De Boer pleaded guilty to a charge of harassment according to the deal, dropping a charge of rape.

Today a second woman tells police that she consensually went out for dinner and drinks with him in Tacoma late last year but doesn’t entirely remember how it ended, SeattlePi reports.

The woman told police the last thing she remembers was sitting at a table with beer and appetizers before waking up naked and in pain in De Boer's apartment.

She said she spoke with De Boer briefly before leaving his place and going to a nearby hospital for a sexual assault examination at the advice and help of her sister.

The exam found she had ingested a potent sedative that causes amnesia. Photos also taken during the exam backed her claim of rape.

Previous crime: In 2009 De Boer, right, was accused of raping a woman at a fraternity house where he was president, a charge he struck a plea deal with finding him instead guilty of harassment

New charge: In November a woman says she went on a date with De Boer, second from right, but blacked out half-way through before waking up to find herself naked and in pain

When the woman asked De Boer what happened, he denied giving her any sedative but admitted to sexually assaulting her, according to police.

The woman told police she had never blacked out before and did not plan on having sex with De Boer during their date together.

During their date the woman claims De Boer had briefly mentioned another woman he had been seeing while president of his fraternity but who had 'gone crazy' on him.

In July of 2009 that possibly same woman, a 21-year-old, accused him of raping her during a fraternity party after a series of advances by De Boer that were unsuccessful.

The woman told a court that after several shots of liquor De Boer first tried making out with her on the steps of the Phi Kappa Theta fraternity house but was turned down.

Punishment: De Boer was removed from University of Washington's fraternity following the 2009 charge, the campus pictured, while also given a suspended sentence, probation and ordered to 15 days of community service

She said he later pulled her into a room and demanded oral sex from her. When she refused he allegedly pushed her onto a bed and raped her.

A detective told a court that De Boer claimed the woman only changed her mind while they were already having sex. He later said she was just upset that he didn't take precautions to ensure she didn't get pregnant.

'The defense counsel and I together interviewed 11 witnesses,' the detective later told a court according to Seattle Pi. 'None of the witnesses saw [the woman] kiss, touch or show any interest in Mr De Boer, so it appears that Mr De Boer is not being truthful.'

The allegations presented before an ‘administrative hearing’ involving fraternity members and alumni led to De Boer’s removal from their fraternal chapter.

De Boer was given a suspended sentence, probation and ordered to 15 days of community service following the plea deal.

Today he faces a second-degree rape charge over the November report.

He has been jailed on $300,000 bail while pleading not guilty to his current charges.
