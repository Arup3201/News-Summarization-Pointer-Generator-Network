Adrienne Maloof has been granted a temporary restraining order against her estranged husband, Dr. Paul Nassif.

The plastic surgeon, 50, was ordered by the court on Wednesday to stay at least 100 yards away from the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star, 51, and their children, TMZ reports.

The couple have three boys - nine-year-old Gavin and twins, Christian and Collin, six - from their nine year marriage.

He must also keep away from the family home and the children's school.

Maloof was awarded temporary custody of their children the same day after she accused her ex of being violent toward their children, claiming that he had 'slapped' and 'choked' them.

Court documents reveal he is now being investigated by the L.A. Department of Children & Family Services over the claims.

According to Radar Online, the couple's marriage counsellor Dr Charles Sophy submitted a sworn statement to the court.

It read: 'On Sunday, September 16, 2012, Adrienne called and told me about an incident involving Paul and the children that occurred on Thursday, September 13, 2012.  Specifically, Adrienne told me that Paul and the children were in the car when Paul became angry in response to Collin kicking Christian's seat, and that he tried to hit the kids while they were all in the car.'

Dr. Sophy interviewed the children with their parents' permission, adding: 'All three children appeared anxious and fearful. They are reluctant to share the details of what happened.'

He continued: 'I further learned that
prior to my meeting with the children on Tuesday, a referral was made 
to the Department of Children and Family Services. I feel that DCFS is 
capable of determining the safety and risk issues to be mitigated and 
ensuring the children's safety and health.'

Nassif denies being violent towards his children and his legal team saying they were 'blindsided by the allegations.'

His lawyer Lisa Meyer has referred to the accusations as 'gamesmanship'.

Nassif had applied for custody of the
children and for the judge to order Maloof to leave the family mansion 
so her could move back in, but his request was denied.

A court hearing will take place in early October to determine if the temporary restraining order and custody arrangement will be made permanent.

Maloof has also put her marital home 
on the market for $26 million. It is unclear if her ex is aware of her 
decision to sell the mansion.

The
pair purchased the property, which featured in the reality show, in 
2004 for $12.7 million and she is now looking to make a rather large 
profit on it.

The 20,000 sq. ft. French chateau-style estate features 8 bedrooms and 11 bathrooms.

The couple are understood to have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and Maloof, whose fortune is said to total $300 million, is said to be confident it will protect her family fortune.

She is the only daughter of billionaire entrepreneur George J Maloof Sr.

Her myriad of business interests include the various holdings of Maloof Companies, of which she is co-owner - notably the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas, the basketball team Sacramento Kings, development company Maloof Productions, and record company Maloof Music.
