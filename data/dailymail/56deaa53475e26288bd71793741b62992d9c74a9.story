The Duchess of Cambridge's power to sell an item has long been acknowledged. When Kate steps out in a design it invariably sells out almost instantly.

And now one enterprising fashion label has made the most of their association with the duchess - by reissuing a style she was seen in - and naming it The Kate.

MaxMara have rereleased the beige belted style just weeks after the Duchess of Cambridge wore it on a public engagement. Unsurprisingly, it is already a sell out success. 

Kate wore the elegant coat with tights and brown heeled ankle boots when she visited Cambridge with her husband in November last year, and it immediately sold out

The Duchess - who is just weeks away from giving birth to her and Prince William's first child - wore the cashmere, knee-length overcoat on a visit to Cambridge last November, garnering a storm of publicity for the brand.

Now, as a note of thanks, the label has reissued the coat and renamed it after her.

The elegant piece, with a high neck
and a bow-shaped belt, is available from the Italian label's 
diffusion line, MaxMara Studio

MaxMara Studio have decided to reissued the elegant coat under a new name, 'The Kate', and it has already sold out online at House of Fraser

The Kate coat costs £875 and is available to buy from House of Fraser in the UK. It has already sold out online.

With myriad brands cashing in on Kate's selling power, many have suggested that the duchess could one day endorse her own clothing line.

Indeed, last year 
the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince 
Harry applied to the Intellectual Property Office to trademark the duchess' royal title - so that one of her official charities could use 
her name on a range of goods including 'clothing, footwear and 
headgear'.

The House of Fraser website shows that the coat has already sold out, despite its rather hefty price tag

A spokesman for St James's Palace said in March: 'We have been registering our new name and logo in different territories around the world.

'As part of that process, we have to choose any categories under which we might conceivably operate in the future. This also protects the foundation against other people using its name illegally.

'We included clothing in case we choose, for example, to make T-shirts in years to come, for marathon runners, etc.'

Eco-label Beulah reissued the £540 pale blue chiffon dress the Duchess of Cambridge sported on a visit Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur in September during a tour to the Far East.

But Beulah aren't the only designers to reissue pieces in order to capitalise on the Kate effect.

Kate's cream silk Whistles blouse was relaunched after selling out when Kate wore it in her official engagement photo, taken by famed photographer Mario Testino.

More recently, designer Rebecca Taylor reissued a blue tweed skirt suit after the Duchess was seen wearing it at a charity event in May.

Missoni also re-released a blue tweed coat, part of diffusion line M Missoni, that was snapped up two years after it first hit the catwalk by the thrifty Duchess at discount outlet Bicester Village.

And it is not just Kate who can carry some serious fashion clout on the high street.

Her younger sister Pippa Middleton's love of the £195 Modalu grab bag caused sales of the design to explode fifty-fold.
