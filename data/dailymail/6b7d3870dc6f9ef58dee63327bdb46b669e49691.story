People living in UK cities will be used to colourful murals popping up overnight, but this could be the world's geekiest graffiti.

To the uninitiated, the wall art might show some nonsensical numbers and patterns, but it actually includes code alongside some of the world's greatest technological minds, including Alan Turing.

The artwork, which has been created in London, Birmingham and Bristol, challenges members of the public to break the codes to be in with a chance of winning tickets to a forthcoming technology fair.

Poor operational procedures and sloppy operator behaviour led to code breakers deciphering the Enigma cipher machine used by the Nazis.

The intelligence produced from decrypts at Bletchley was code-named 'Ultra' and helped the Alllies defeat U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic.

Cryptanalysts were chosen to work at Bletchley for various intellectual achievements, whether they were linguists, chess champions, crossword experts or mathematicians and in one instance, the ability to solve a Daily Telegraph crossword in under 12 minutes was used as a test.

Alan Turing is arguably the most famous code-breaker to work at Bletchley and devised a number of techniques for breaking German ciphers, including the method of the bombe, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine.

The graffiti contains undeciphered Morse code, JavaScript and Binary code that hides a secret message and is part of a bid to get young people interested in coding, which is essential to develop computer software and more.

Alan Turing, who is widely considered to be the godfather of computer science, is pictured in two of the urban murals as this month marks the 75th anniversary of the Government Code and Cypher Schools' arrival at Bletchley Park.

Turing and his team went on to break the Enigma machine code used by the Nazis at the top-secret location, in what many people consider to be a major turning point in World War Two.

The graffiti also features present coding heroes who will speak at an event next week, including 
Nolan Bushnell who created pioneering video game company Atari and Jon 
‘Maddog’ Hall who is executive director of operating system Linux.

The artwork was commissioned by 
technology festival and school for code-cracking, Campus Party, which 
will be held at the O2 in London on 2 to 7 September.

Available on the website as well as in hidden locations, people who crack the codes can win a pair of tickets to the event, which is designed to excite over 5,000 young people each day about digital and technological trends.

It is hoped that events such as this one will help to develop hackers, developers, gamers and entrepreneurs of the future, in tandem with government initiatives such as Tech City.

Holly Marshall, Campus Party manager at O2, said: 'Deciphering code has long been a role for some of the greatest minds the world has ever produced.

'At Campus Party we want to bring skills such as code breaking to the masses, broadening the digital skill base in the process.

'This unique graffiti gives a taste of what we can expect to see during the festival, whilst providing a talking point that resonates and intrigues our key tech-savvy community.

The festival will feature over 100 speakers and over 500 hours of content across five days.
