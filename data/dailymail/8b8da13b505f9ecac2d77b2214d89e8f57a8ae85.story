Wearing a pretty pink dress adorned with a bow, she looked as though she could be celebrating her mother’s wedding.

Instead, five-year-old Jessie Curran was saying a poignant farewell to another parent she adored.

PC Fiona Bone had been planning a civil partnership with Jessie’s mother Clare when she was gunned down in a residential street.

Yesterday, Jessie held her mother’s hand as the devastated pair led mourners in a funeral cortege which brought the streets to a standstill.

They gathered for the service in Manchester Cathedral with PC Bone’s parents, Paul and June, and her sister Vicky.

PC Bone, 32, was killed along with PC Nicola Hughes, 23, after being lured to investigate an apparent burglary on September 18.

Thousands of police officers and members of the public lined the city’s streets to pay their respects, just a day after they had done the same for PC Hughes.

Service: Manchester city centre came to a standstill for the second day in a row for the funeral of shot policewoman PC Fiona Bone

Mourners threw flowers on to the 
cortege when it passed and broke out into spontaneous applause as the 
hearse, flanked by police motorcycle outriders, made its way through the
city centre.

PC Bone’s 
coffin, with her police hat and gloves arranged on top, was carried into
the cathedral by six pallbearers to the sound of bagpipes.

During
the service, Sergeant Stephen Miskell recalled memories of his 
colleague, saying: ‘She was a gentle little bookworm but a strong, 
brave, rock of a woman. She was an inspiration in life.'

It
was the second consecutive day that Deansgate in Manchester city centre
had come to a standstill. A service for PC Hughes was held on 
Wednesday.

The officers died together in the line of duty after being lured to their deaths when they responded to a reported burglary at a house in Hattersley, Tameside, on September 18.

PC Bone lived in Sale, Greater 
Manchester, with her partner Clare Curran, who she met through a mutual 
friend, and her daughter Jessie who regarded the police officer as her second parent.

PC Bone had found 'love in Clare and fulfilment in Jessie' mourners at her funeral were told today.

She
was said to be 'so happy' in life, planning their wedding, and on the 
day she died had spoken to Miss Curran to discuss invitations to send to
guests.

The officer's 
family, who lived in Scotland before moving to the Isle of Man, paid 
tribute to 'a wonderful daughter, sister, partner and parent'.

Senior representatives from all 43 
forces in England and Wales joined PC Bone's family and friends and her 
colleagues from Tameside division among the 1,000 mourners inside 
Manchester Cathedral.

Fellow Scot Sir Alex Ferguson, manager of Manchester United, also attended the service.

The cortege was led by six horses 
from GMP's mounted unit followed by the hearse, bearing the coffin, 
which was shrouded in black cloth. On top of the coffin was PC Bone's 
hat and gloves.

Officers and the public all bowed their heads as the cortege passed and ripples of applause broke out along the route.

As the funeral cortege arrived at the cathedral a lone Scottish bagpiper played a mournful lament.

A
large portrait photo of PC Bone was carried into the cathedral, 
followed by her coffin, draped in black cloth and carried by six of her 
police colleagues.

PC Bone’s family led remaining
mourners into the church for the start of the service.

Again
hundreds of police and public gathered outside at the rear of the 
cathedral to stand in silence listening to the service relayed on loud 
speakers.

The coffin was taken in to Brahms’s Herzlich Tut Mich Verlangen. The first hymn sung was The Lord’s My Shepherd I’ll Not Want.

Bible readings were given by PC Bone’s colleagues, Inspector Jane Brown and PC Tracey Miskell.

GMP
chaplain Charles Nevin read the poem She Is Gone, while mezzo-soprano 
Iona Fisher gave a performance of Beyonce’s version of Ave Maria.

Police and the public gathered at the rear of the cathedral to listen to the service broadcast on loudspeakers.

Tragic: Police Constables Fiona Bone, 32, and her police colleague Nicola Hughes, 23, were killed as they responded to what they thought was a routine burglary call in Mottram, Greater Manchester

Sgt Miskell told the congregation that PC Bone was 'a perfect police officer'.

He said: 'Fiona was wonderful. She 
was wonderful at keeping colleagues' spirits high with her bubbly 
nature. She was wonderful about caring for others.

'Fiona represented the best that humanity has to offer the world but that makes her loss even greater.'

PC Bone joined Greater Manchester 
Police as a volunteer special constable in November 2005 and became a 
full-time officer in 2007 posted to Tameside division.

The Chief Constable of Greater 
Manchester Police, Sir Peter Fahy, said: 'It is clear that helping 
people and building community spirit was at the heart of what she did.

'In the force she quickly gained recognition as an officer who set the highest standards for herself and others.

'Like most police officers Fiona absolutely loved her job and felt privileged to serve the public.'

He said she had received a chief 
superintendent's commendation in 2009 for her outstanding contribution 
in an investigation into a series of burglaries and robberies which 
secured convictions.

'Fiona treated everyone with dignity, compassion and respect whatever their background,' he said.

She 'undoubtedly had great promise for the future'. He added that PC Bone was 'small in stature but big in personality'.

Like PC Hughes, Sir Peter said her 'great sacrifice' would not be forgotten.

When the hour-long service came to a close, police officers again formed a guard of honour as PC Bone's coffin was carried outside, with her hat, black leather gloves and Queen's Diamond Jubilee medal on top.

Her partner and her daughter held hands 
as the coffin was placed in the hearse while PC Bone's sister and 
parents stood close-by, stony-faced, never taking their eyes off the 
coffin.

Again a piper played a lament - PC Bone, though born in England, had strong connections north of the border and regarded herself as Scottish.

As the hearse pulled away, followed by the other cars in the cortege, officers stood to attention and bowed their heads. The silence was pierced by applause from members of the public who had come to pay their respects.

PC Bone will have a private burial in Scotland, attended only by close family and friends.

Dale Cregan, 29, has been charged with the murder of both policewomen, two further murders and four other attempted murders.
