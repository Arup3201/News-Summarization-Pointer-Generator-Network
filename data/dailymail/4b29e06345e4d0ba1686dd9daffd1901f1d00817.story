The European Parliament is today expected to clear the way for controversial ‘Frankenfood’ crops to be grown in Britain.

MEPs will vote to clear the block on growing controversial genetically modified (GM) crops that has effectively stopped commercial cultivation for a decade.

The new rules will allow each country to decide for itself whether or not to grow a GM crop – once it has been ruled safe by EFSA, which is the EU’s food safety body.

The deal has been engineered by the British government, which wants GM crops to be grown here, following a series of secret briefings with GM companies and their trade body.

The British government wants to be able to grow genetically modified crops that are banned in European countries such as Germany and France. Above, former Tory Environment Secretary Own Paterson views a genetically modified crop trial in Hertfordshire

The net effect is that even if a GM crop is banned in Germany, France, Italy and other European states, the Westminster government can allow it to be grown here from as early as next year.

The Conservatives, Labour and Lib-Dems in Westminster support GM crops, however, the administrations in Scotland, Wales and many English councils remain opposed.

There is also concern among consumers amid suspicion the crops pose risks to human health and the environment.

At the same time, organic farmers and green campaigners point to the damage caused by the growing of GM crops on an industrial scale in North America.

There, superweeds have developed that are difficult to control, leading to the need for ever more powerful chemical weedkillers, while important species like the Monarch butterfly are under threat.

Critics fear that pollen from GM plants will spread to other conventional and organic crops, as well as honey, so polluting the entire food chain.

The first GM crops to be grown here could be varieties of corn or maize created by the labs of Syngenta and Monsanto, which are modified to give them protection from the weedkiller glyphosate, also known as RoundUp Ready.

The idea is that these crops can be blanket sprayed with the chemical which will kills off any weeds but allows the corn to grow.

Advocates of genetically modified crops say that the technology can increase production and nutrition while opponents point to dangers to the environment

Advocates claim that in the future GM technology could be used to produce more food in areas of drought, or develop plants that are high in beneficial nutrients.

The new legal regime that is expected to be adopted today  is at odds with the principles of the EU and single market, which has previously insisted that all member states should apply the same rules on food and farming.

Despite that, it will be voted through because countries opposed to GM will be able to ban them, while those in favour, such as Britain and Spain, can go ahead.

The arrangements have been hailed as a success for the pro-GM campaigner and former Tory Environment Secretary, Owen Paterson, who was sacked last year. He, along with ministers from Spain, led the drive in Brussels to speed the commercial growing of GM crops.

The policy sprang out of a series of secret briefings between ministers, their civil servants and the GM industry’s Agricultural Biotechnology Council, which began in the summer of 2012.

Ministers subsequently promised incentives for investment, a strategy for biotech and, most significantly, efforts to reduce regulation and speed up GM crop approvals, which will come to fruition today.

The details of these meetings were revealed following a series of Freedom of Information Act requests by the campaigning group GeneWatch.

Its director, Dr Helen Wallace, said: ‘This EU deal arose from secret meetings between the UK Government and the GM industry, which wants to plant its RoundUp Ready GM crops in England, despite opposition from the public.

‘Massive environmental problems with these crops in the USA include the devastating loss of 90per cent of Monarch butterflies and the spread of resistant superweeds, due to blanket spraying of the crops with weedkiller.

‘Growing GM in England would risk contamination of non-GM crops, pushing up food prices and risking loss of export markets. The Scottish and Welsh governments will say no to GM crops, but in England people will have to fight for local regions to opt out.’

Liz O’Neill, the director of GM Freeze, said: ‘Contamination incidents all over the world show that seed and pollen will spread wherever the wind, wildlife and human error take them, right along the supply chain.

‘This directive offers no meaningful protection to people who want to make informed choices about what they are eating or to farmers who want to protect their fields from the superweeds and biodiversity loss associated with the kind of GM crops likely to be heading our way.’

Last week, the government’s new Environment Secretary Liz Truss confirmed her support for GM. She told a farming conference in Oxford: ‘I think GM crops have a role to play here in Britain.’

However, her counterpart in Scotland, Richard Lochhead, a member of the SNP, said: ‘The jury is still out on the environmental and scientific case for GM. We don’t want to see GM ruin Scotland’s reputation as a clean, green country.’
