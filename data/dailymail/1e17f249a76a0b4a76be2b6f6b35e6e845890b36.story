This is the moment a masked robber brandishing a gun gave a shop worker 60 seconds to fill a bag with Â£180 in cash and cigarettes.

The 28-year-old was looking after his uncle's Best One corner shop when a man wearing a ski mask burst in with a gun, threatening to shoot.

He pointed the weapon at the victim's head and roared: 'I swear I'll shoot you'.

Threat: The 28-year-old was shaken after a man held a gun to his face and gave him 60 seconds to fill a bag

Placing a holdall on the counter, the thug ordered the shop worker to fill it as fast as he could, keeping the gun held to his face.

As the terrified worker scrambled to open the till, the man kept shouting and pushing the gun closer.

'I was sitting behind the counter and he just burst in and held a gun at me and shouted 'give me the money otherwise I will shoot you'.

'I started to panic and I think he wanted me to go faster so he shouted again, "I swear I will shoot you".

'I wanted him out of the shop because I was afraid he was going to shoot me.

'I filled up his bag as quickly as I could to get him away.'
