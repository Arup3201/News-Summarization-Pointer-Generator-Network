Distraught: Jimmy Savile's nephew Vivian Savile (pictured) died of 'a broken heart' because of the paedophile scandal that engulfed his famous TV presenter uncle, his family say

A distraught nephew who 'hero-worshipped' Jimmy Savile has died 'of a broken heart' after the details of his uncle's decades of child-abuse became public.

Charity volunteer Vivian Savile, 69 - described himself as a 'last of the Saviles' - and was admitted to hospital just a week after his relative was outed as a paedophile.

Vivian, from Pontypridd, South Wales, was the only son of Savile’s brother Vincent and had 'become depressed and unable to eat properly' after Savile's hundreds of victims came forward.

He died on October 29.

A family spokesman said: 'Heartbreak may have been the cause of his condition.

'He hero-worshipped his uncle and was proud to be the last male member of the family with the surname Savile.

'At the height of the media blitz, he became quiet and withdrawn, leading to a lack of interest in almost anything including food.'

In his last interview six weeks ago, Vivian said: 'Jimmy’s reputation is hugely important to me.

'We never had even an inkling of anything untoward involving him.

'The dead cannot defend themselves, they would never have dreamed of saying this when he was alive and now Jimmy should be left to rest in peace.'

But he was admitted to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant, South Wales, just a week after the scandal broke.

His funeral was attended by close family friends and staff from the local Red Cross shop where he worked as a volunteer.

Relationship: Vivian lost contact with Jimmy when his parents divorced but always admired him

Keen cyclist Vivian became weak and unable to walk any distance which suggested 'something was very wrong with him'.

The family explained Vivian had spent time with his uncle in the 1970s - but lost touch with him when his parents divorced.

His father moved to Leeds with his family, but Vivian remained in Wales.

'Although he had no contact with his father’s family for 25 years, it is generally felt that when the current Savile scandal concerning Jimmy became almost daily news, the allegations affected his own self esteem,' the family spokesman said.

Before he died, Vivian, 69, could not accept what his uncle had done.

'These are malicious rumours and I don’t think they should be broadcast,' he said.

Hurt: In Viv's last interview before he died he thought that the victims were 'malicious' because his uncle was unable to defend himself

'I don’t know why these girls would make such claims.

'Some people just want to be on TV or to make a bit money.

'I’m not saying they’re lying but why wait until he’s gone to come forward.

'There was never anything dark or sinister about Jimmy, he loved children, but he just wanted to entertain them, he would never abuse his position.

'He was just like he was on TV it wasn’t an act. He enjoyed the attention of course but there was never any funny business.'

A spokesman for his local coroner’s office said Vivian Savile is believed to have died from natural causes and no inquest will be held.
