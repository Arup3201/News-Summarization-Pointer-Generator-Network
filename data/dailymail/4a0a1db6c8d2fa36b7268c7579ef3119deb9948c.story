All 50 U.S. states should lower the alcohol limit for drivers to 0.05 per cent, the National Transportation Safety Board voted today.

The top transportation safety agency is advancing its campaign to cut down on drinking-related road deaths through a stricter definition of impairment.

At a meeting in Washington, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) called on state authorities to reduce the legal limit by nearly 40 per cent.

Should the DUI limit be lowered to 0.05% across the U.S?

All 50. states now have a blood alcohol content (BAC) limit of 0.08 percent for drivers aged 21 and over, and younger drivers are held to stricter standards.

The NTSB has no authority to change the state laws but its backing of the lower limit could add pressure on regulators to adopt the 0.05 percent rule.

'This is critical because impaired driving remains one of the biggest killers in the United States', NTSB chairman Deborah Hersman said.

'To make a bold difference will require bold action. But it can be done', she added.

But The American Beverage Institute, which represents 8,000 restaurants, hit back at the report to lower the limit.

The institute told USA Today: 'The average woman reaches 0.05 per cent blood-alcohol content after one drink. But more than 70 per cent of drunk-driving fatalities are caused by drivers with at least 0.15 per cent, representing six or seven drinks.'

The institute's managing director, Sarah Longwell, added: 'This recommendation is ludicrous. Further restricting the moderate consumption of alcohol by responsible adults prior to driving does nothing to stop hard-core drunk drivers from getting behind the wheel.'

NTSB has launched a 'Reaching Zero' campaign to help avert alcohol-related accidents and increase public awareness about the dangers of drinking and driving.

Alcohol-impaired driving causes an estimated 10,000 deaths per year in the United States, making up 30 percent of all U.S. highway deaths, according to the NTSB.

In a 2011 survey by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, more than 14 percent of U.S. drivers admitted to driving when they thought they were close to or over the legal limit.
