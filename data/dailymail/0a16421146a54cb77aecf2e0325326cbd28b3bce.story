If you have cash to spare, and are bored with free sites such as Facebook and Twitter, there's a new social network designed specifically for the rich. 

Called Netropolitan, the network costs $9,000 (£5,500) to join, which includes a $6,000 (£3,600) initiation fee, plus a $3,000 (£1,800) annual fee.

Perks include unlimited cloud storage and no advertising – but the rest of the features are similar to those seen on free sites such as Facebook.

Netropolitan (pictured) was set up by Manhattan-based composer James Touchi-Peters. For $9,000, (£5,500) users get unlimited cloud storage, and can share files with other users, as well as no advertising. However, the rest of the site resembles Facebook, meaning users can update statuses, add photos and find friends

It is available on desktop and mobile browsers, and there are also smartphone and tablet apps for iOS and Android.

To use the site, members must be over 21 and must register using their real names.

Moderators monitor the site and check for abuse, trolling and misuse. 

‘Netropolitan includes many features you have come to expect from a modern online social network - and a few that you may not,’ explained Mr Touchi-Peters.

‘Once you are a Netropolitan member, you have access to status updates and discussion rooms with all other members.

‘You can create groups, have conversations about everything from fine wines to classic cars to vacation destination recommendations.’

Although the site doesn’t feature any advertising, users can post classified ads and sell items to other members directly.

For security and privacy reasons, Mr Touchi-Peters added that the site isn’t indexed on Google, doesn’t have any features for non-members, and will never release member names, numbers or other details.

And Mr Touchi-Peters added: ‘Netropolitan is not a concierge service.

Netropolitan is an alternative to free sites, but also for rich people who aren’t considered celebrities, meaning they can’t use Facebook Mentions (pictured). Facebook Mentions launched in July and is exclusive to ‘public figures’. The firm hopes the app will mean celebrities are more likely to interact with their fans

‘Our Member Service Associates will not book you a charter jet, or find you tickets to a sold-out Broadway show.

‘They exist solely to help members technically navigate and find their way around the social club.’

The firm hopes the app will mean celebrities are more likely to interact with their fans, and don’t have to use the traditional site.

It also makes it simple to hold online chats - and Facebook shows Mariah Carey chatting with fans as one example.
