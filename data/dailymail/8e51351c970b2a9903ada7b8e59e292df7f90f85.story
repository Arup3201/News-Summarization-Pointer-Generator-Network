A baby boy who was born with a serious heart defect and has stunned doctors by healing himself.

Oscar Tasker was so ill his mother Lois was told not to hold him because even the slightest touch could trigger a fatal heart attack.

He was born on January 28 this year weighing 9lb 9oz with Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA) - a condition which means the main arteries are the wrong way around.

Oscar Tasker was born with his main arteries the wrong way around and suffered a heart attack during surgery to correct the defect - this caused the left side of his heart to die

The condition, which affects one in 100 babies born in the UK, starved Oscar's body of oxygen.

When he was just 15-weeks-old he underwent two emergency seven-hour operations within 24 hours at Birmingham Children's Hospital to correct his arteries.

Despite having a 98 per cent success rate, his parents Lois and Jason Tasker were devastated when doctors told them the left side of his heart had died after he suffered a cardiac arrest.

Surgeons advised the family to prepare for the worst and even suggested they turn off his life-support machine in order to let him ‘die with dignity’.

But his parents refused and he was transferred to a specialist heart unit at Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, 200 miles from their home in Radford, Coventry.

Oscar was put on a 'Berlin Heart' - a 15kg machine, which supports the work of the heart and acts as a life-saving bridging device for children awaiting a transplant.

He was put on the heart transplant list but his parents were told to expect the worst and were even advised to turn off his life support machine so that he could 'die with dignity'

Incredibly, after just 100 days on the machine, doctors told Oscar's parents that his heart had made an almost full recovery and he was fit enough to come home.

His thrilled mother, 28, said yesterday: ‘I was a bit sceptical at first. I didn't quite believe it and still can't get my head round it, the fact that he's much better. I can't wait to bring him home.

‘The time he had on the heart machine may have calmed his heart, that is the only explanation I can think of but I genuinely think it's a miracle.

‘All we were looking for was some improvement and hope that he can get better and thankfully that has happened.

The couples' other five children (pictured from left to right: Liam, two, Milo, three, Ryan, seven, Paige, nine, Abbie, 11) were born all perfectly healthy so Oscar's health problems 'were quite a shock', according to mother Lois.

His parents, Louis and Jason, refused to give up on him and he was put on a 'Berlin Heart' - a 15kg machine, which supports the work of the heart and acts as a life-saving bridging device for children awaiting a transplant

‘The doctors made a decision and told us he was off the transplant list last Wednesday.

‘I didn't believe it, I asked them to tell me again, I questioned it at first because I did not expect to hear it, it was a huge relief.

‘When he was really poorly, we couldn't touch him or hold him, it was heart-breaking.

‘It was minimal touch, the most we could do was maybe touch his finger because his heart pressure would go up, the oxygen levels in his blood would fall, we couldn't hold him till he was 14 weeks old.

‘Touching him stressed him out too much and it could have killed him. All I wanted to do was pick him up and cuddle him but I knew I couldn't because it could kill him.’

She explained that most babies have an arterial switch operation and go home two weeks later but Oscar's coronary artery was damaged and he had a massive heart attack which killed the left side of his heart.

After 100 days on the 'Berlin Heart', Oscar's parents, Jason and Louis Tasker (pictured), were told that his heart had made a miraculous recovery and that he no longer needed a transplant

She said: ‘It turned into heart failure and nothing could be done except for a new heart.

‘Now, he is not in intensive care we can hold him, have him out when we like, we dress him, bath him, all the things people take for granted.

‘His personality is shining through, he can be a bit grumpy sometimes but that is understandable but on a good day he just smiles and it is amazing to see.

‘My other five children were all perfectly healthy so for this to happen was quite a shock.’

Oscar has now been transferred back to Birmingham Children's Hospital and is expected to return to the family home within the next two weeks.

His father, Jason, 33, a bus driver for National Express, said: ‘The left side of Oscar's heart was dead.

Mrs Tasker says that she couldn't believe it when she was told that Oscar was so much better but says that she was delighted to be able to hold him and care for him

‘The surgeons were saying it wasn't looking good.

‘They were talking about switching off his machine to let him die with dignity.

‘Then we were told we could send him to Newcastle for specialist treatment while waiting for a donor heart. It was our last hope.’

He added: ‘It's like something just clicked. Oscar's like a different baby. He smiles at you, he even moves and kicks his legs.

‘It's all beyond our wildest dreams. I'm still in shock. We'd been hoping and praying for a miracle and we thought a transplant was his last hope.

‘We always hoped he would recover, that he'd keep his own heart.

Jason and Lois Tasker whose son Oscar's heart has miraculously healed itself. See NTI story NTIMIRACLE. A baby has amazed doctors and his parents after a heart defect that would have killed him miraculously HEALED on its own. Little five-month-old Oscar Taskerís body was being starved of oxygen after the main arteries to his heart were the wrong way round when he was born. After undergoing two emergency seven-hour operations within 24 hours at Birmingham Childrenís Hospital, things got worse for Oscar. His chances of survival were dangerously slim when he suffered a cardiac arrest and the left hand side of his heart effectively died. However, after praying for a miracle, his parents, Jason Tasker, 33, and wife Lois, 28, have finally got one. Amazingl

‘This is like a dream to us, this is the thing we've been waiting for but feared was never going to happen.

‘It's not only great news for Oscar because whatever heart he would have had can now go to another child in need.’

Oscar will soon go home to his brothers and sisters - Liam, two, Milo, three, Ryan, seven, Paige, nine and Abbie, 11.

Dr Richard Kirk, consultant paediatric cardiologist in charge of Oscar's care, believes time on the artificial 'Berlin Heart' gave the baby's own organ time to recover.

He said: ‘Someone up above must have been smiling down on Oscar.

‘We are delighted but still have to be little bit cautious. He's not out of the woods.

‘We just have to hope he continues with his improvements.’

Dr Kirk said since 2005 when Freeman began using Berlin Hearts about 15 children had recovered in the same way as Oscar.
