Blackpool have signed Costa Rica midfielder Jose Miguel Cubero for £250,000 from Herediano.

And manager Jose Riga is also lining up a move for former Fulham defender Matt Briggs, 23, and ex-Brighton winger Andrea Orlandi, 29.

Cubero, 27, has agreed a one-year deal, with the option of a further 12 months.

Rebuilding job: Jose Riga must reassamble a squad at Blackpool after last season's calamitous slide

56-year-old Riga has endured a frustrating spell at Blackpool after joining from Charlton and has a fractious relationship with chairman Karl Oyston.

Blackpool added Nathan Delfouneso to their ranks on Tuesday after agreeing terms with Peter Clarke, Jacob Mellis and Tomas Cywka on Monday.

But Delfouneso's official arrival brings the total number of players on the club's books to just 12.

The former Aston Villa striker is no stranger to Bloomfield Road having had two loan spells there in the past, most recently last season.
