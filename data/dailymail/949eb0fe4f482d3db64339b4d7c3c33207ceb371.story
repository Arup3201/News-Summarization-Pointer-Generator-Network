An in-form Simona Halep stands between Serena Williams and a third successive WTA Finals crown after both players booked their place in Sunday's title decider in contrasting manner.

Williams fought back from a set down and a break in the third set against Caroline Wozniacki to win 2-6 6-3 7-6 (8/6) in two hours and 13 minutes, while Romanian Halep needed just 67 minutes to despatch Agnieszka Radwanska 6-2 6-2.

Williams and Halep will meet in Sunday's showpiece at the Singapore Indoor Stadium four days after Halep hammered the world number one 6-0 6-2 in a round-robin fixture, which prompted Williams to declare herself embarrassed.

Serena Williams is targeting her third successive WTA Finals crown ahead of Sunday's final in Singapore 

Williams defeated Caroline Wozniacki 2-6 6-3 7-6 (8/6) in the semi-finals to progress  

Another comprehensive defeat appeared to be on the cards for the 18-time Grand Slam singles winner on Saturday morning as Wozniacki made a blistering start to the last-four encounter, holding serve twice after breaking Williams' opening service game to race into a 3-0 lead.

Williams regained her composure, but, although she held her next two service games, Wozniacki did too.

Williams' frustration boiled over in the seventh game when she smashed her racquet after missing a break-point chance and her Danish opponent poured salt in her good friend's wounds by then breaking to win the first set 6-2.

The American star showed her frustration during her game against Wozniacki when she smashed her racket 

Wozniacki made a decent start to the second set and won her first two service games, but Williams drew on all her experience to break twice to win the set 6-3 and force a decider.

All the American's hard work had seemingly gone to waste when Wozniacki broke to take a 5-4 lead and serve for the match, but the Danish world number eight could not close it out and the decider went to tie-break when both players held the subsequent service games.

Williams sent down her 12th ace to set up match point and she duly sealed the win when Wozniacki had no answer for one of her trademark thunderous forehand ground strokes.

Speaking in a post-match courtside interview shown on BT Sport 1, Williams paid tribute to the crowd for helping her to seal a comeback victory.

Simona Halep made light work of Agnieszka Radwanska needing just 67 minutes to close out the match 

'I just kept thinking, 'Well, if I lose I get to go home, but if I win I get to stay in front of this amazing crowd',' she said.

'I heard so many fans out here today and after I lost the first set you guys were so behind me and it's the only reason I was able to pull through, so thank you so much Singapore.'

Williams, who clinched the year-end world number one ranking without playing on Friday after Maria Sharapova was eliminated from the tournament, was quick to pay tribute to her opponent.

Radwanska struggled to match her Romanian opponent's intensity as she crashed to a 6-2 6-2 defeat 

She added: 'I have to say Caroline played a great match. It was really difficult today. I felt really bad because she's so amazing and she's so nice and she's the only one who hadn't lost in this tournament, she really deserved to win.

'Just congrats to her and I love you and thank you for playing so well.'

World number four Halep, meanwhile, also raced into a 3-0 lead in her semi-final encounter against Radwanska and dropped just one point on her first serve as she took the first set 6-2 without breaking sweat.

Halep then broke her opponent's first two service games in the second and held her own for another 3-0 lead before Radwanska finally registered in the second set by breaking her opponent at the sixth attempt.

The Polish world number six then undid all her hard work by dropping her next service game before Halep held her own to carve out a 5-1 lead.

Radwanska delayed the inevitable by finally holding her serve in the second but Halep soon brought an end to the match by breezing through her next service game to wrap up victory in a little over an hour.

'I'm very excited to be in the final,' Halep said afterwards in a brief courtside interview broadcast on BT Sport 1. 'I've played my best tennis here this week.'
