Jailed: Thuggish Jason Appleby was sentenced to four months for beating his pet dog with a piece of wood as horrified neighbours looked on

A violent thug who beat his puppy with a piece of wood has been jailed after horrified neighbours filmed the attack on their phones.

Jason Appleby, 38, was filmed hitting and jabbing six-month-old dog Bonnie with a piece of wood, and kicking a children’s playhouse as the terrified dog hid inside.

RSPCA inspectors have praised residents who caught their neighbour on camera and Appleby has been jailed for four months. 

He was also banned from keeping animals for life after the attack in the garden of his home in Hull, East Yorks.

When officers arrived, Appleby told them: 'I should have killed it with a hammer.'

Inspector
Hannah Bryer said: 'The video footage of this incident speaks for 
itself.

'Appleby’s conduct towards his dog can only be described as 
disgraceful and vile act of deliberate cruelty.

'The RSPCA were only able to bring this 
prosecution to court due to the bravery of members of public who 
witnessed the incident and gave statements as to what they had seen.'

Appleby later told inspectors he was 
hitting the ground and fence to scare Bonnie after she tore up a dirty 
nappy in his kitchen. 

But Inspector Bryer said no-one: 'To 
try to justify his actions as an attempt to ‘train’ or ‘teach’ the dog 
how to behave just shows how ignorant he was to the needs of his pet.'

Bonnie escaped with just minor injuries and was later adopted by Terry Morrill who is now working rehabilitate the traumatised animal.

Terry said: 'I have never known a dog so nervous in all my life as she was when I first got her. It was heartbreaking to see.

'If anybody came too close to her, or you tried to put a lead on her, she would be trying to get away.

'She would be petrified. She is so much better now, which is good to see. You couldn’t ask for a better dog, she is lovely.'

Shameless Appleby eventually pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to Bonnie on the day he was due to stand trial.

New start: Although Bonnie escaped with minor injuries she has been left 'petrified' by the attack, she has now found a new home

The court heard he had gave 'sarcastic' answers while being interviewed by the RSPCA and insisted he didn’t intend to hit or hurt Bonnie.

Jailing Appleby for four months, District Judge Frederick Rutherford told him: 'You, as the owner of the dog, took it upon yourself to go outside, pick up a piece of wood and try to hit your dog with that wood. The dog was clearly utterly terrified.

'I have seen video footage in which you are obviously trying to injure it.

No escape: The attack has has a lasting impact on Bonnie who is now still 'petrified' by anyone going near her

Relentless: As the terrified animals cowers inside a children's playhouse Appleby continues to kick it in fury

'The dog ran into a child’s playhouse in an effort to shield itself from your acts of violence but you continued and the playhouse ends up being taken into the air by you so the dog is again forced to run away from you to escape.

'This was a sustained act by you to cause that dog harm, your attitude to which is one of sarcasm.

'The fact is, you were clearly out of control and, in those circumstances, you sought to cause serious harm to that dog. This is a terrible case and custody must follow.'
