Arrested: Brad Davis, a former Marine, has been accused of suffocating his stepfather by giving him an 'atomic wedgie' with the victim's own underwear on December 21

A former Marine allegedly suffocated his 58-year-old stepfather by giving him an 'atomic wedgie'.

Police found Denver Lee St. 
Clair dead in his McLoud, Oklahoma home with the waistband of his 
underpants pulled over his head on December 21.

The man's stepson, 33-year-old Brad Davis, allegedly told police he pulled out the schoolyard bullying move after his stepfather 'jumped him' during a night of drinking.

'I'd never seen this before, but when we first looked at our victim seeing the waistband of his underwear was around his neck,' Pottawatomie County Sheriff Mike Booth told NewsOK.

Davis told detectives the altercation began when St. Clair badmouthed his ex-wife Tressia St. Clair - Davis' mother. 

The men began to fight before St. Clair allegedly tried to punch Davis.

Father and son brawled before Davis allegedly pulled the elastic band of his victim's underwear over his head from behind, killing him.

Davis said he acted in 'self-defense'. However the man's death has been ruled a homicide, with the State Medical Examiner's office finding St. Clair died of suffocation and blunt force trauma to the head.

Police believe Davis altered the crime scene to make it look like the men had had a fight before he called 911.

'We
 continued our investigation and uncovered evidence that led us to 
believe that this was more than just a fight,' Sheriff Mike Booth said.

The District Attorney is now handling the case and Davis will likely face a murder charge.

Breitbart TV reported St. Clair was under a permanent 
protective order filed in 2008 by his wife Tressia St. Clair.

The woman claimed she found her husband embracing, in a 'sexual way', a drinking buddy and that he later grabbed her by the neck and threw her through a bathroom door, NewsOK reports.

Pottawatomie County court records show his wife filed for a 
divorce against him in 2010 but the divorce was dismissed. Denver St. 
Clair then filed for a divorce against her last year.

A Facebook page was set up after St. Clair's death last year to remember the motorcyle-lover. His funeral was held on December 28.

'He was one of a kind a man, he will be missed dearly,' his daughter Carol St. Clair wrote.

'Uncle Denver would be proud of all motorcycles riding in his honor. Thank you to each and everyone who rode in his honor and helped with memorial service,' his niece Tonya Renee Lester Dawson wrote.
