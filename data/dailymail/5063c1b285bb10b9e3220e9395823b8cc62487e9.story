England coach Steve McNamara spoke of his frustration after watching his side suffer a narrow defeat by New Zealand in Dunedin that puts them on the brink of elimination from the Four Nations Series.

England could yet play the Kiwis in the final if Samoa beat champions Australia by fewer than eight points on Sunday, but that is unlikely.

An early exit would leave McNamara cursing his luck as Ryan Hall had a try disallowed for the second time in a week after the controversy against Australia. England were also denied by the woodwork when Gareth Widdop’s first two conversion attempts rebounded off the uprights.

‘We are frustrated,’ said McNamara. ‘We were a fingernail away last week and a width of a goalpost on a couple of occasions this week. We’ve been involved in three tremendous Tests.’

Needing to win by 10 points to make the final, England’s task grew after conceding the first of Jason Nightingale’s two tries inside two minutes. But Hall and fellow winger Josh Charnley went over before half-time to keep them in contention.

Manu Vatuvei’s try early in the second-half made it 16-8 and, although Hall grabbed a second to extend his record try haul to 24 in just 23 appearances, England once more came up just short.

‘In the first half I felt we started to get control but New Zealand are a very good team and they hit us with a couple of sucker punches,’ said McNamara.

‘We came out firing at the start of the second-half, Josh nearly went in at the corner and Hall got one disallowed.

‘We just allowed New Zealand a couple of offloads that allowed them to get to the other end of the field a little bit too easily. Both teams were absolutely out on their feet. There was nothing left at the end.

‘It was an unbelievable Test match. We’ll come back strongly from this.’

New Zealand skipper Simon Mannering conceded: ‘They played some great footie, shifted the ball and chanced their arm and defensively put us under a lot of pressure.

‘We’re just happy to get the win.
