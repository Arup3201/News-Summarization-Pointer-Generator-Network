A shocking video has emerged of the moment a mother walked her two children straight into the path of an oncoming car.

The two young children are seen bouncing off the car bonnet and landing in the middle of the road.

Amazingly they only endured scratches and bruises from their terrifying ordeal which took place in Russia.

Shocking: A video has emerged of the moment a mother walked her two children straight into the path of an oncoming car. The two young children are seen bouncing off the car bonnet and landing in the middle of the road

The drama was filmed due to a camera mounted on the dashboard of the car - dashcams are common in Russia for a number of reasons including insurance scams.

It begins with the car driving down the road - it appears to be travelling the wrong way as all the cars are parked up in the opposite direction.

The mother is seen stepping out behind a parked car accompanied by her two children - a little girl and younger boy.

Realisation: Only when the woman, wearing yellow, turns to her left does she see the oncoming car and she opens her mouth in horror

Impact: The vehicle smashes into the two children as the mother is pushed off to the side of the road

Smash: The pair mount the bonnet and both of their glasses are seen flying off their face at the moment of impact

Terrifying: The children go flying through the air and skid along the road before lying in a heap of the ground

Landing: The children go flying through the air and skid along the road before lying in a heap of the ground

Shock: The little girl gets to her feet unsteadily as the boy, wearing a patterned hooded sweatshirt turns around to greet his anxious mother who is running towards the pair

Only when the woman, wearing yellow, turns to her left does she see the oncoming car and opens her mouth to cry out in horror.

But it's too late - the 
vehicle travelling at 29km/h smashes into the two children as the mother is
pushed off to the side of the road.

The pair mount the bonnet and the children's glasses are seen flying off their face at the moment of impact.

The children go flying through the air and skid along the road before lying in a heap of the ground.

Relief: The mother picks up the little boy as the girl, dressed in a pink top and jeans holds her head

Traumatic: The anxious mother lifts the little boy up as the upset girl follows behind

The little girl gets to her feet unsteadily as the boy, wearing a patterned hooded sweatshirt, turns around to greet his anxious mother who is running towards the pair.

She picks up the little boy as the girl, dressed in a pink top and jeans holds her head.

The trio stand in shock in the middle of the road as anxious bystanders rush to them - it looks like the boy is more injured than his older sister.
