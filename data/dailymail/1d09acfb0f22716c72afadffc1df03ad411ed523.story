This parent is giving a whole new meaning to ‘school bag’ as he helps a class of primary pupils safely cross a river by taking them in a plastic bag.

When the children in Sam Lang village, Dien Bien Province, near Hanoi in northern Vietnam could not get to school due to spring floods, one father found an unorthodox solution.

As the nearby suspension bridge was out of action, he put the children in a plastic bag to keep them dry, and carried them across the flooded river.

His incredible devotion to the children’s education was filmed by their teacher Tong Thi Minh.

In
 the clip, one of the children’s fathers can be seen carefully wrapping 
up each child in a plastic bag before he launches himself neck deep into
 the raging torrent.

Once at the other side, the still dry child jumps out, before the man swims back to pick up another.

In the clip filmed last year, female teachers and students were seen waiting for their turn to traverse the Nam Po stream.

Vietnamese
 newspaper Tuoi Tre News said a local man was captured holding the bag 
in one hand and swimming across the water with the other hand despite 
the powerful currents.

Miss Minh told the newspaper: ‘It's normal. That's the only way to cross the stream because no bridge can stand floodwater.

‘I've
 taught here since September last year. At first, I did not know how to 
ford the stream so I had to follow what local villagers did later.’

According
 to Miss Minh, many parents in the village also bring their children to 
school that way to keep their uniforms dry when the area is flooded.
