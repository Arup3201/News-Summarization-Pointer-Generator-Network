Jailed: Oliver Gore-Booth shot more than 70 secret films of women with a spy camera shaped like a pen

A voyeur has been jailed for a year after he filmed women with a spy pen more than 70 times in gym showers, on the Tube and even in his own bathroom.

'Addict' Oliver Gore-Booth, an ex-public schoolboy whose uncle was Britain's High Commissioner in India, spent three years amassing the depraved stash before he was caught in a north London gym.

A staff member picked up his camera thinking it was just a pen - and called police after discovering its contents.

It took almost no time to find 32-year-old Gore-Booth, because he had been a member of the gym for four years and caught himself on camera pressing the record button.

Police seized two laptops at his home in Wandsworth, south west London, and found more than 70 videos.

They showed women showering at the gym and using sunbeds, and included up-skirt shots of women on London Underground escalators.

The HR manager even filmed videos of women using the bathroom at his home, Blackfriars Crown Court heard, and filmed a couple having sex in a hotel room at a wedding.

In each of the videos, Gore-Booth could be seen either in the footage while filming or planting the camera and then retrieving it at the end.

Police found several more similar videos which Gore-Booth had downloaded from the internet.

The 32-year-old, whose uncle was  diplomat Sir David Gore-Booth and whose great-great-grandfather was  Arctic explorer the 5th Baronet Gore, of Lissadell, tried to deny responsibility.

He told police: 'It will take a long time to explain, but I was approached four weeks ago and offered money.

'I said no, but saw the camera in the changing rooms and made the wrong decision to move it away.'

Depraved: Gore-Booth was caught out by a staff member at the Anytime gym in Islington, north London

But the lie quickly unraveled and he pleaded guilty to five counts of voyeurism and four of outraging public decency.

Lyell Thompson, prosecuting, described how Gore-Booth was finally caught in the Anytime Gym in Islington, north London.

Mr Thompson said: 'He thought it was just a pen and he picked it up with the intention of handing it in.

'But he forgot until he got home and, when he examined the pen, he found it was a camera with a UBS stick.

'He put it in his computer and saw a man installing the camera in the shower cubicle before he immediately turned it off.

'He handed the pen in to the gym manager, who recognised Mr Gore-Booth who had been a member since 2010. The police were called and he was arrested the next time he visited the gym.

Gore-Booth went to Canford School in Wimborne, an independent school which charges £10,000 a term

One victim became anxious and paranoid after finding out she had been filmed in the bathroom at Gore-Booth's home.

Mr Thompson, summarising the victim's statement, said: 'She says what happened is not normal, not right.

'She keeps thinking of the victims, the poor girls who have no idea they are even on the film.'

She described constantly feeling like she is being watched and said the episode has impacted on her confidence and social life.

Another victim said in a statement the filming had been a 'breach of trust and an invasion of privacy'.

Gore-Booth attended Canford School in Wimborne, an independent school which charges £10,000 a term, and was represented by a top Queen's Counsel barrister in court.

His uncle,   Sir David Gore-Booth, died aged 61 in 2004 after a 34-year diplomatic career as Britain's ambassador to Saudi Arabia and High Commissioner in India.

His great uncle was leading diplomat Lord Paul Gore-Booth, while his great, great grandfather was an Arctic explorer, the 5th Baronet Gore, of Lissadell, co. Sligo. 

Andrew Trollope QC, representing Gore-Booth, said his client had been seeking help for his addiction and said he was described as a 'decent, kind-hearted and loving person' by friends.

He also said Gore-Booth's girlfriend was sticking by him 'in what must be difficult personal circumstances for her'.

He added: 'He's had to confront a long-standing addiction to this kind of behaviour and recognising the unacceptability of his conduct and the depth of his problem has been a difficult and painful process.' 

Descendant: Oliver Gore-Booth is the nephew of the late Sir David Gore-Booth (above), Britain's former High Commissioner in India, and is also the great-great-grandson of Arctic explorer the 5th Baronet Gore

Judge Henry Blacksell QC told Gore-Booth his crimes deserved a custodial sentence, despite pleas from the defence to suspend the jail term.

Speaking in front of Gore-Booth's family  in the public gallery, he said: 'Some of the people who you recorded came to your address expecting hospitality or safety and you breached this in a mean and cunning way.

'It was a terrible thing and it must have been very shocking for those who received and welcomed your hospitality to suddenly be aware of what a gross breach of trust that was when you secretly filmed them in instances of loving intimacy.

'That is, in my judgement, a gross breach of trust, let alone the filming in the hotel bathroom.'

Gore-Booth hung his head and closed his eyes as he was jailed for nine months for installing the cameras and three months for each of the voyeurism charges, to run concurrently.

He will also be placed on the sex offenders' register for ten years and made the subject of a sexual offences prevention order.
