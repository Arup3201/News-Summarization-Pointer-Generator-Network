They may have worked together for three years at Real Madrid, but Sergio Ramos seems to have forgotten all about his former manager Jose Mourinho.

The Spanish defender pretended to confuse the Chelsea boss with Celta Vigo president Carlos Mourino when the Portuguese's recent quotes were put to him this weekend.

Ramos and Mourinho are locked in a spat over comments the Spanish defender made about Chelsea stars Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa.

The Real Madrid man questioned whether Chelsea's two players were genuinely injured, insinuating that they were more committed to playing for their club than country.

But Mourinho hit back, stating that Ramos 'is not a doctor', and criticised him for questioning the duo.

And, when asked about those comments, Ramos seemingly snubbed his former boss, acting as if he didn't know who Mourinho was.

'I have nothing to say to the president of Celta,' Ramos responded after Real Madrid's win on Saturday night when the Chelsea manager's jibe was mentioned. 

The defender was more eager to discuss Real Madrid's win over Malaga, their 16th straight victory.

That meant Carlo Ancelotti broke a club record - which was jointly held by Mourinho.
