Family and friends of one of Heston Blumenthal’s two senior chefs killed in a horrific road accident during a promotional tour in Hong Kong has spoken of their loss.

Magnus Lindgren, 30 died after a double-decker bus ploughed into the taxi 
in which he and Briton Ivan Jorge, 34, were travelling.

The Swedish chef was in Hong Kong working as a consulting chef for Mr Blumenthal after seven years at the Michelin-starred Fat 
Duck restaurant in Bray, Berkshire.

Tragic: The chefs were in Hong Kong with Fat Duck's head chef Jonny Lake who tweeted this photo on Saturday saying: 'Jorge, Magnus and Mike prepping for a special dinner at Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong tonight.'

Reports last night claimed Mr Blumenthal had been in Hong Kong and was travelling in a separate cab at the time of the crash.

Magnus Lindgren's father Carl Gustaf Lindgren, 61, said that he struggles to comprehend that his son is gone.

‘It is indescribably empty right now. This is the worst thing a human being can be subjected to.’

The talented chef spent seven years 
with Heston Blumenthal at the Fat Duck, working his way up to assistant 
head chef, newspaper Expressen reports.

‘Cooking had been his passion since he was 16 years old,’ his father said.

‘Not many people get to travel with Heston Blumenthal around the world. They really appreciated him.’

Mr Lindgren was working for Blumenthal as a consulting chef, having recently returned to his native country to set up his own 
business.

His father spoke to Swedish newspaper
 Aftonbladet about the loss of his son a mere six months after Magnus 
moved back to his home town of Stockholm.

‘And now he has been taken from us. It feels dreadful.’

Former colleague and friend Erik 
Gustafsson, 29, also spoke to the paper, praising Magnus Lindgren’s 
passion for his work and the talented chef’s excitement about assisting 
Heston Blumenthal at the Michelin star restaurant.

He was a humble and really lovely 
guy. He had such fire and passion for food. You can’t work 80 hours a 
week if you don’t,’ Mr Gustafsson said.

‘He was incredibly appreciated by his colleagues and had recently been helping Heston picking new dishes.'

The tragic accident which claimed the lives of the two chefs and their driver Wong Kim-Chung, 53, happened on Monday on a busy Hong Kong road.

The driver
 of one of the buses reportedly fell unconscious for ten seconds and careered 
down a hill before hitting two cars, the taxi and the second bus.

The trio
 were trapped in the cab for more than an hour before firemen could free
 them from the wreckage.

They were later declared dead at the hospital.

A further 56 people, including a seven-month old child, were injured in the pile up.

The chefs had been in Hong Kong with Jonny Lake, the head chef of The Fat Duck, to promote a new Blumenthal 
restaurant.

Mr Lake had tweeted a picture of Mr Jorge and Mr Lindgren 
along with another chef preparing a special dinner at the Mandarin 
Oriental Hong Kong on Saturday night.

The
 Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, last night refused to confirm the identity
 of the men but said they were senior members of staff and described 
them as ‘uniquely talented young chefs’.

A spokesman said: ‘They were both great and dear friends…loved by everyone who worked with them.’

He added: 'Heston is in Hong Kong and will soon be on his way to Australia before making his way back home.'

Self-taught
 chef Mr Blumenthal, 46, who has a £1million, two-year deal with Channel
 4, has become renowned for his adventures in so-called molecular 
gastronomy.

He launched the Fat Duck in 1995 after buying a 450-year-old pub, The Ringers in Bray. The past few years have seen him expand his business into London. He also stars in adverts for Waitrose.

A source close to the Mandarin Hotel said: ‘Heston had been out in Hong Kong on a promotional tour for the hotel.

'It is pure chance that he was not involved in the accident. His two chefs got into one cab and he got into another soon after.’

Mr Blumenthal was due to appear at a Gourmet Escape event in Western Australia this weekend but organisers expect him to pull out.

The Fat Duck was open as usual last 
night. A total of 46 chefs are believed to work in the kitchen. A 
restaurant spokesman said: ‘The entire team, as you may imagine, are 
devastated.’

Chef Raymond 
Blanc offered his support to those at the Fat Duck via his Twitter 
account. He wrote: ‘My heart and my thoughts are with the families of 
the 2 young chefs from the Fat Duck & with Heston & the whole 
team at this tragic time.’

Heston's son Jack, himself an aspiring chef, tweeted: '2 chefs from the Fat Duck killed in a car crash in Hong Kong :/ My Best goes out to the friends and family and everyone at the Duck.'

He added: 'So tragic RIP'

Scottish chef Neil Rankin tweeted his followers: 'Tragic news. A waste of great talent. Condolences to the fat duck team.'

A former Fat Duck chef, Ben Godwin, also tweeted: 'RIP.......Legends!' in honour of the tragic pair.

Hong Kong police said the bus driver was arrested for causing death by dangerous driving and he has been released on bail.

Last night, a Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said that the family of the British chef, thought to have been Ivan Aranto Herrera Jorge, was being supported by consular officials.

'We can confirm the death of a British National who was involved in a road traffic accident in Hong Kong on 19 November,' the spokesman said.

'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'
