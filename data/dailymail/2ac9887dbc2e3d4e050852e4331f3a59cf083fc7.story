Sony, Samsung and Sega were among the winners at this year’s Pocket-lint awards.

But it was Apple that scooped Gadget of the Year for its iPhone 6 - the first time any iPhone has been awarded the coveted accolade, despite its widespread popularity.

The iPhone 6 also beat the HTC One (M8) handset to pick up the award for Best Phone. 

Apple scooped Gadget of the Year for its iPhone 6 at this year's Pocket-lint awards. It is the first time any iPhone has won the title during the awards’ 11-year history. The handset also beat the HTC One (M8) to pick up the accolade for the Best Phone

But its larger version - the iPhone 6 Plus - lost out on the Best Phablet accolade, which was awarded to Samsung’s Galaxy Note 4.

Stuart Miles, founder and chief executive of  Pocket-lint told MailOnline: ‘It's the first time in the 11-year history that the iPhone has won at the awards, and it's clear that this is down to Apple's move to a bigger screen.

‘Apple has, according to the judging panel, industry, and the public, not only created a phone people want, but one that is worthy of winning an award too.’

Apple's iPad Air 2 scooped the Best Tablet title, while Tesco's affordable £129 Hudl 2 was close behind.

The winners were decided by an panel of judges, the tech industry and the general public.

The vote breakdown was 50 per cent from the panel, 40 per cent from the tech industry and 10 per cent from the public. 

Alien: Isolation (pictured left) was voted the most popular game, beating blockbusters such as Destiny and Far Cry 4. The judges liked the title because it is different from classic first-person shooters - and the alien itself can't be killed. Mario Kart 8 (right) was crowned the runner up

Sega's Alien: Isolation was voted the most popular game, beating blockbusters such as Destiny and Far Cry 4.

‘There’s no question about it, games are getting more intelligent,' continued Mr Miles. 

'You’re not just running down tunnels killing everyone you can. The Alien game is like the film, you can’t kill the alien so the best way to survive is by hiding.’

He said that the judges liked the game because it was different and a ‘slow burner’.

‘It’s a refreshing change. One of the judges said that they haven’t played it yet because they’re too scared. Games should evoke excitement,’ he added.

Mario Kart 8 was the second most popular game, and this could be seen as a further move away from the traditional first-person shooter genre.

All eyes were also on the wearables category, which was won by LG’s G Watch R (pictured), which unlike a lot of its competitors, has a circular screen. The more traditional Pebble Steel model was the runner up

Mr Miles continued: ‘If you look at what people are buying, games have to be clever and offer something different.’

One of the most divisive categories of the night was the award for the most impressive games console.

But Sony’s PlayStation 4 pipped Microsoft’s Xbox One to scoop the 'Best home entertainment device' award.

And all eyes were also on the wearables category, which was won by LG’s G Watch R, which unlike a lot of its competitors, has a circular screen.

‘It’s a forward thinking device and its design is breaking boundaries - not just any band will do,’ Mr Miles said. The more traditional Pebble Steel model was the runner up.

Philips Hue's smart lighting won the Best Smarthome Device, while Nest came second, in another category that is set to explode and become increasingly competitive in years to come.
