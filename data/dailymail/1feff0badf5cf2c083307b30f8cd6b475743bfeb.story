With her penchant for thigh high boots and leopard print she has earned a reputation as fashion maverick of the House of Commons - and has even been compared to supermodel Cara Delevingne.

And Theresa May, 57, didn't disappoint at her latest public appearance as she arrived at the Sugarplum Dinner at London's One Mayfair last night looking the very embodiment of glamour.

The Home Secretary, who was joined by her husband Philip John May, paired a slinky scarlet dress with embroidered heeled pumps.

The £245 pointed shoes, by Caroline Issa for LK Bennett, featured kitsch floral embroidery in the same bright red as her dress.

She finished off her look with a textured silver clutch bag and sparkling bejewelled necklace, earrings and cuff.

Mrs May is known for her penchant for fashion and love of colour, and has long been known as one of the most adventurous dressers in Parliament.

Her standout looks include leopard print kitten heels, which she famously wore to the 2002 conference.

More recently, she appeared at the Conservative Party conference in a daring tartan suit by Vivienne Westwood - the same one Cara wore to her 21st birthday - which she teamed with a pair of £215 Russell and Bromley flats.

The Home Secretary was also spotted wearing thigh-high patent boots and brightly patterned coat to the welcoming ceremony on Horseguard's Parade for the president of South Korea earlier this month.

Other guests at the Sugarplum Ball 
include Pippa Middleton, who wore a racy nude and black 
gown. She arrived on the arm of beau Nico Jackson who looked dapper in a velvet
suit and bow tie.

Poppy Delevingne, sister of Cara, to whom Theresa has been compared, was also in attendance.

The model wore a billowing pink and orange stripe dress and matching pointed heels.

The Sugarplum Dinner marked the launch of Sugarplum Children; a new website and fundraising initiative for children (and their parents) who are 10 years and under with type 1 diabetes, and to raise money for type 1 diabetes charity JDRF.
