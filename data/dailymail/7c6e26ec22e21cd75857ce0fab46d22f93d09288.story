Real Madrid striker James Rodriguez has heaped praise on team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo, insisting the Ballon d'Or winner is very modest about his achievements in the game.

The Colombian international, who joined the La Liga giants for £63million last summer, says he has been more than impressed with the work ethic and attitude the Portuguese star continues to display.

He told FIFA.com: 'Cristiano is excellent, both on and off the pitch. For me, he deserved his Ballon d'Or victory for what he achieved in 2014, yet he is totally modest.

'We have a very good relationship. Out on the pitch, everyone knows how valuable he is, but it's impressive to watch how he trains and works off the pitch. 

'That's where you see the real Cristiano, and you understand why he is where he is.'

Rodriguez and Co will be hoping they can effectively fill the void of the suspended Ronaldo this weekend, as the La Liga leaders take on David Moyes' Real Sociedad side on Saturday.
