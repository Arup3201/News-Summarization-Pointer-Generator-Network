Kate Upton is 'not thrilled' that lingerie brand Victoria's Secret used her old photos in their new catalogue.

The blonde pin-up was stunned to discover old images of her posing in the brand's black Body bra gracing the pages of the lingerie brand's new catalogue without her permission.

A source told MailOnline: 'Kate is not thrilled Victoria's Secret is using these photos.

'She is not contracted to work with Victoria's Secret and was not notified before the images, taken in 2011, were used.'

Surprise appearance: Kate Upton is 'furious' that her photo from 2011 was used in the new Victoria's Secret catalogue (pictured), without her knowledge. Just last year, the lingerie giant branded her look 'too obvious'

The photos surfaced online on 
Tuesday much to the 20-year-old star's surprise since she was branded 
too 'obvious' looking to model their underwear in 2012, after a 
spokesperson insisted they would never use her.

Kate's popularity is on the rise, 
with the last year seeing her land covers for the likes of Vogue and 
Sports Illustrated magazines as well as campaigns for Mercedes-Benz and 
Accessorize.

The model also made FHM Sexiest Women in the World 2013 list, ranking at number 8.

But her appearance in the catalogue certainly came as a surprise after model booker for Victoria's Secret Sophia Neophitou told The New York Times: 'We would never 
use Kateâ€¦ She's like a footballer's wife, with the too-blond hair and 
that kind of face that anyone with enough money can go out and buy.'

Ms Neophitou appears to be alone in her opinion of Miss Upton though.

The model, who shot to fame after landing the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in 2012, has become the darling of the fashion set.

In just under 18 months, she has appeared on three Vogue covers, fronted the inaugural issue of CR Fashion Book, and posed in photo shoots for V Magazine, Terry Richardson and Harper's Bazaar.

But
 while Miss Upton has never been an official Angel, it would seem that 
she has maintained a relationship with Victoria's Secret since her 
teens.

Buzzfeed reveals that she modelled 
pyjamas for the brand back in 2011, when she would have been about 18, 
well before her Sports Illustrated fame.
