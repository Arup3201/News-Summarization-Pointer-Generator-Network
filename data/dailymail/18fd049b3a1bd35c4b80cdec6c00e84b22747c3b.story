Novak Djokovic heralded the most special victory of his career after winning his seventh Grand Slam and second Wimbledon title.

The 27-year-old will reclaim the world No 1 spot when the rankings are released on Monday, and he said: ‘It’s definitely the most special. At the time of my career, for this Grand Slam trophy to arrive is crucial, especially after losing three finals in a row. I had started doubting myself a little.’

The Serb admitted he was relieved to win his first Grand Slam since appointing Boris Becker as his coach last December.

Tears of joy: The Serb hailed his victory as the 'most special' of his career

‘Many people had doubted him as well,’ said Djokovic. ‘I was close to winning on several occasions, particularly in the fourth set when I served for the match, and I could easily have lost concentration in the fifth and handed him the win.

‘But I didn’t, and that’s why this win has special importance to me mentally. I managed to not just win against my opponent but win against myself as well and find that inner strength that got me the trophy.

‘I think that this year everything got together and emotionally, physically and mentally I was on the top of my abilities. 

‘I’m going to try to use it in the best possible way and for my confidence to grow for the rest of my season and my career.’

Djokovic, who will marry his pregnant fiancee Jelena Ristic in a small ceremony in Montenegro on Wednesday, took a bite out of the grass after beating Roger Federer in five sets — just as he did after defeating Rafael Nadal to win his first Wimbledon title in 2011 — but said the turf tasted even better this time around.

‘I had a nice bite of the grass,’ he said. ‘I thought there was less grass than a few years ago, so I had a little bit of soil as well. But, nevertheless, it tastes like the best meal I ever had in my life.

‘But, sincerely, this has been the best quality Grand Slam final that I ever been part of. I’ve had a longest final against Nadal in the Australian Open 2012 but, quality-wise from the first to last point, this is definitely the best match. To be able to win against Roger, one of my greatest rivals, on this occasion on a court that he’s been dominating for so many years makes it a very special trophy for me. I had tears of joy and was overwhelmed by the moment and the occasion.’

Djokovic insisted he was not distracted by the Centre Court crowd’s vociferous support for Federer, the seven-time champion who was consoled by the the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge after his defeat.

Federer, though, joked that he does ‘not need another’ Wimbledon crown, but said there is still more to come from him, even at the age of 32.

The Swiss said: ‘I already have seven. It’s not like I need another one. But it would have been awfully nice to have it. I think that’s what the feeling was of the people, and I felt that.

‘In a match like the one today where I needed support, they were there. I could sense that they really wished me well and hoped for me to either get back into the match or hopefully lift another trophy here at Wimbledon.

‘I’m very happy to see that, with feeling normal, I can produce a performance like I did in the last two weeks. That clearly makes me believe that this was just a stepping stone to many more great things in the future.

‘I feel like if I’m playing well I feel like I can control the field to a degree. Clearly there’s never a guarantee, but I do believe the top guys are the ones we know and who are still going to be deciding outcomes of the bigger tournaments. I’m very happy to see that I can do it week for week, match for match and point for point. It’s all right there.’
