Killed: Dr. Perry Inhofe died when the plane he was piloting came down outside Tulsa in a heavily wooded area

Controversial Republican Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe has confirmed that his son died in a plane crash on Sunday.

Dr. Perry Inhofe worked as an orthopedic surgeon in Tulsa and was piloting the Mitsubishi MU-2B-25 twin turboprop aircraft that came down five miles from Tulsa International Airport.

Oklahoma Highway Patrol spokesman George Brown said authorities confirmed that one person died in the crash which occurred at 3.40 p.m.in a heavily wooded area.

According to flight tracking websites the aircraft took off from Salina, Kansas and was due to land at the airport after a 45 minute flight.

Pilots cleared to land after the fatal crash reported to Tulsa World that the aircraft Dr. Inhofe was flying experienced engine failure.

Witnesses Jake Bray and his uncle, Bryon Fry, were in the woods when the plane crashed about 400 yards away.

'I saw it go over once and don't think anything of it,' Bray said to Tulsa World. 'Then it circled around and I saw one propeller out. Then it nosed down and went down hard.

'It started spiraling out of control and it hit the ground.

'We were talking about trying and maybe pulling the guy out if that was possible.

'It was fully engulfed when we got there and it looked like the wings had come detached. There were tires popping ... There was nothing we could do.'

Dr. Perry Inhofe is an orthopedic surgeon with Central States Orthopedics in Tulsa and received a degree in biomedical engineering and electrical engineering from Duke University in 1984.

He is one four children the Senator has with wife Kay Kirkpatrick.

Dr. Inhofe has been a commercial pilot since 2009 and was certified as a flight instructor in February of 2012.

Senator Inhofe has just recovered from quadruple bypass surgery in October and had only returned to Washington last week after suffering an extreme blockage in five arteries.

Inhofe turns 79 next year and has been in the U.S. Senate since 1994 and is up for re-election in 2014.

The venerable politician sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee and is known as one of the more consevative members of Congress.

He believes that man-made global warming is a hoax and impossible because 'God's still up there.'

In 2006, in an interview with Tulsa World, Inhofe said that environmentalism reminds him of 'the Third Reich'....You say something over and over and over again and people will believe it.'

He is also known as a strong supporter of Israel and that its citizens have a right to settle the land around Palestine because it is God given.

Inhofe is in favor of a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, against adding sexual orientation to the definition of hate crimes, and he voted against prohibiting job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

As a result he does not hire openly gay staff members because of the possibility of a conflict of interest.

He campaigned for his Senate seat in 1994 with the phrase, 'God, guns and gays' and he was seen by the Associated Press to be running an ad with 'anti-gay overtones' when one of his commercial  featured a wedding cake with two male figures atop, blending into his opponent's face.

In June of 2006, Inhofe proudly pointed to a photograph of his entire family and claimed on the Senate floor that none of his family were lesbian or gay.

'As you see here, and I think this is maybe the most important prop we’ll have during the entire debate, my wife and I have been married 47 years. We have 20 kids and grandkids. I'm really proud to say that in the recorded history of our family, we've never had a divorce or any kind of homosexual relationship.'

The controversial senator is also infamous for voting against federal disaster relief for states such as New Jersey and New York in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, but arguing for assistance in Oklahoma.

He claims that the circumstances between natural disasters in his state and others are totally different and cannot be compared.
