A soda can fan has stacked up a staggering 4,000 strong collection - despite the fact he can't stand the taste of fizzy drinks and only ever drinks water.

Father-of-two Jay Watson, 42, from Illinois, has been collecting cans as a hobby for just three years but in that relatively short space of time he has stacked up a staggering 4,000 drinks cans.

Mr Watson's massive collection has taken over all cupboards and wardrobes in his home and basement and is now spilling into his garage.

But although his hobby may seem a fizzy drink fan's dream, Mr Watson hasn't actually drunk a single drop of his collection.

Mr Watson doesn't enjoy fizzy drinks and he would prefer to drink water.

So when Mr Watson gets a new can, he actually pours the contents away. He will then carefully rinse and save the can.

'I am passionate about my can collection but the funny thing is, I don't ever drink soft drinks,' he said.

'I do feel bad when I pour the drink down the drain, but I have to if I really want the can. I will have the occasional juice or iced tea if it comes in a can, but I usually just prefer water.'

The audio technician loves to collect cans from across America and around the world and his collection started with a Pepsi can, which had sat on the top of a water cooler at his work place for several years.

Mr Watson said: 'Someone bought it from a vending machine but found it had a small hole in it, so was placed on top of the water cooler where it stayed for years.'

He has spent more than $1,600 collecting on his drinks collection, which includes cans from 30 different countries.

In his collection Mr Watson has a Pepsi can from 1983 as well Tizer and Sparking Lemonade cans from the UK.

His oldest can has been preserved since 1965 and is an American orange drink called Nehi.

Mr Watson also has one blank, unopened can which came in a box of cans he ordered off the internet.

Mr Watson said: 'It is great as a novelty piece as I haven't got a clue what is inside.'

As he only drinks water he will sometimes get his two children involved with his hobby.

Mr Watson said: 'Fizzy drinks are a treat for the kids. And when they do have it it's usually without caffeine as they have enough energy as it is.

'One of our favourite things to do is to 'taste test' a new beverage, whether it's soda, tea, juice, whatever. I have a few cans in the pantry now that are awaiting a taste test before they move into the collection.

Mr Watson said when he started collected he never thought he would gather so many cans, with his original target set at just 500 cans.

Mr Watson said: 'The collection began with just a few cans. I soon started collection all sizes, 8oz, 12oz, 16oz, 24oz, 32oz, whatever I could get a hold of.

'And I couldn't limit myself to just older steel cans or just newer aluminium, so I collect both. It looked like I would never find a limit.'

The only rule he has is that he doesn't collect beer cans.

Mr Watson said: 'I would collect any size beverage can made of any material with any style opening mechanism - as long as it didn't contain alcohol.'

He said: 'I don't drink alcohol and I had to draw the line with my collection somewhere, so call of my cans are non-alcoholic beverages.'

'I've bought 1,432 cans off eBay, 1,265 cans from trades or from other collectors. As far as energy drinks go, I like the design of Monster Energy cans.

'The design of the regular flavours are kind of boring, but their speciality flavours usually have really neat cans.

'And any Halloween-themed can gets moved to the top of my favourites list as well.

'In one of the can lots I bought, there was a blank, silver can. It's a sealed can complete with pull ring still intact, but there's no printing on the can at all. It's interesting because I have no idea what it could be.'

Mr Watson has no plans to stop collecting and often asks friends and relatives to look out for old or unusual cans which he doesn't already have.

He said: 'I love this hobby and I am always keen to get my hands on new pieces to add to the collection.'
