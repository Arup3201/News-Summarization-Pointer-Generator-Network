Street violence: This busy area of LA is where three men stole Nydia Rivera's phone before trying to force her into a car

'Upon leaving the restaurant I got followed out by three guys,' Rivera told KTLA. 

Target: Rivera seems to have been targeted by three men who brazenly tried to force her into their car in Mid-Wilshire

'I turned around to kind of see what was happening and he reached out and grabbed my cell phone.'

Rivera told KTLA that the men tried to force her into their car, driving off as she was still struggling.

She was dragged for two blocks before she was pushed out of the open door.

'My head broke the fall on the way down and I blacked out,' Rivera said.

When she came to, she was lying in the street and couldn't feel her arms and legs.

'I woke up from the fall and I thought at first I was paralyzed,' she said. 

'I had no feeling in my legs in my arms or my whole body and I finally gained feeling.'

Disturbingly, her cries her help from passersby were ignored.

'There was a ton of people around and nobody helped,' she said.

Rivera suffered a concussion, a neck injury and cuts and abrasions from the ordeal, as well as mental trauma.

'It’s the grace of God that I’m even alive to this day,' she told KTLA.

'I don’t even know how I survived it.'

The men who attacked Rivera have not been found but she is hoping that someone who witnessed the incident will come forward and call the LAPD with information.

The model, whose website says she is Miss Puerto Rico 2013, isn't going to let the experience get the better of her, and has planned a charity benefit Sunday at Busby's in Santa Monica to draw attention to violence against women.
