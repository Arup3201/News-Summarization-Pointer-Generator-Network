The Oscar-winning actor called on lawmakers to tackle the ‘curable problem’

Jeremy Irons is leading a campaign to ban free plastic bags across Europe.

The Oscar-winning actor called on lawmakers to tackle the ‘curable problem’ as the European Commission tabled proposals that could lead to a total ban by 2014.

Among the measures being  considered are landfill bans, taxes and pay-as-you-throw schemes to encourage recycling.

Promoting his documentary Trashed, which focuses on some of the world’s most polluted places, Irons said plastic waste litters the most remote parts of the globe thanks to our ‘throw-away’ culture.

He gave ‘100 per cent’ backing to the Daily Mail’s Banish The Bags campaign, which calls on companies and politicians to reduce the number of plastic bags in our countryside and rivers. 

The actor said: ‘I would like to see a Government policy implemented of zero waste. In San Francisco, they have achieved 80 per cent recycling of all waste, so it is proven to be possible.

‘Worldwide commodity prices are rising . . . it seems obtuse to bury or burn those commodities that could be reused at far less cost than producing them anew.’ Irons, 64, said it would be much easier to cut the volume of plastic being produced, rather than finding ways to get rid of it.

‘I am an actor, not an environmentalist, but from what I have learned, I believe the construction of further incinerators in England is an unnecessary, costly and retro-gressive step, as well as being a danger to our collective health.’

Ban: Of the some eight billion plastic bags used in Britain in 2011, around two thirds ended up in landfill or being incinerated

Asked why he thought there were no 
restrictions on disposable plastic bags in England, he said: ‘People are
 not yet aware of the seriousness of the problem. I hope Trashed will 
allow people an insight on this quite curable but global problem. It 
will not be cured without the communal and political will to do so.’

Shoppers are currently charged for 
plastic bags in Wales and Ireland, where usage has dropped by up to 96 
per cent. Scotland is also implementing plans to charge for the bags.

Asked whether England should follow 
suit, Irons said: ‘Of course we should . . . it is eminently possible to
 change people’s habits. It makes financial and environmental sense.’ 
Despite a Coalition promise to tackle the issue, 330million extra bags 
were handed out by shops in 2011. Most are used for just minutes, but 
can harm wildlife for generations.

The Daily Mail’s campaign, launched 
in 2008, has won support from groups such as the Marine Conservation 
Society and the National Trust.

EU environment commissioner Janez Potocnik said that recycling could protect resources. 
He said: ‘Managing plastic waste is a major challenge in terms of 
environmental protection, but it’s also a huge opportunity for resource 
efficiency.’
