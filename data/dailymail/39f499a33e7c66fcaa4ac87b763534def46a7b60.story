Some of Greece's most celebrated beauties are getting a facelift.

And after almost 2,500 years it's not surprising they're looking a little weather-beaten.

The Caryatid statues, which until the late 1970s propped up a section of the Erechtheion Temple on the Acropolis, are being cleansed of grime inside the museum where they're now housed.

The Caryatids: It will take about seven months to clean each of the larger than life-sized figurines

Restoration work is taking place in the Acropolis museum in Athens, surrounded by a white fabric screen to protect visitors from laser beams, which can cause permanent eye injury.

Museum director Dimitris Pantermalis said
 the main reason for cleaning the sculptures on the spot was to avoid 
the potential hazards of moving them.

One of the six Caryatids was removed by Lord Elgin in the 19th century and today stands in the British Museum.

The other five were removed from the 
Erechtheion in 1979 to protect them from air pollution and acid rain, 
and replaced by copies.

But there's the additional value of offering tourists the spectacle of restoring some of the greatest glories of the ancient world.

'We want to offer visitors a backstage peek,' he said.

Visitors are impressed: 'The fact that it was in situ, taking place in the museum, it does bring it home to you the actual level of care that is needed to bring these back to life,' said British tourist Trevor Richards, from Manchester.

Planning began in 2011 and the restoration is expected to be completed this June

It takes about seven months to cleanse each of the larger than life-sized statues, which were carved around 420 B.C. Work began in 2011, and is expected to be finished in June.

'The process removes all of the pollution, the smoke and everything that has settled on the statues for more than a century, and leaves intact the patina, that orange hue that the statues took on with the passage of centuries,' Pantermalis said.

'It's done with very great care to avoid any possible damage.'

The Erechtheion Temple was sacred to the gods Athena and Poseidon, and associated with the first kings of Athens. It later served as a church, a Frankish palace and a Turkish harem.

Although Greece's oldest examples of pillars in the human form are a century older, the Caryatids are the most famous of their kind, and were widely imitated from Roman times to Europe's classical revival.

The conservators are using laser technology developed specially for the Acropolis sculptures by the Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas in Crete.

'The laser beam hits the black crust formed on the surface of the statues over the years, and that absorbs energy and disintegrates,' said conservator Costas Vassiliadis, who heads the six-strong team.

'The crust has a much lower resistance threshold than the marble, which is not affected.'
