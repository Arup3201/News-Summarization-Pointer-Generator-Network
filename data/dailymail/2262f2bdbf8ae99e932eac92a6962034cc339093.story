Mario Mandzukic is set for a £17.5million move to Atletico Madrid, according to reports from Germany.

German newspaper Bild have reported that the Bayern Munich forward is on the verge of signing a five-year deal with the Spanish club.

The 28-year-old signed for the German giants in 2012, and went on to score 48 goals in 88 games over two successful seasons.

Finisher: The forward scored 48 times in 88 games for the club

But, following the arrival of Robert Lewandowski from Borussia Dortmund on a free transfer, Mandzukic decided that his time in Munich has come to an end.

The 28-year-old indicated his desire to leave the club earlier this summer, telling Croatian newspaper Sportske Novosti before the World Cup: 'I met (Bayern chairman) Karl Heinz Rummenigge before the (German) cup final and told him I wanted to leave the club.

'I've had a fantastic time at Bayern. It's a great club and I never thought I'd want to leave, and especially not at this point in time.

'But, let's be honest, I cannot play to my strengths under Guardiola's style - no matter how hard I try.

'I realised that after the 1-0 defeat by Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final first leg and, that being the case, it's best for all parties that we go our separate ways.

'Guardiola is an outstanding coach and I wish him and everyone else at the club all the best in the future.

'Bayern and the club's fans will remain the best and most emotional chapter in my career.'

Celebrations: Mandzukic won a host of trophies during his two seasons at the club

Differences: But he felt that manager Pep Guardiola's tactics did not suit his style of play

Mandzukic's most recent action came for Croatia at this summer's World Cup.

He was suspended for their 3-1 defeat in the opener against Brazil, but returned to score twice in their 4-0 mauling of Cameroon.

Unfortunately, though, a 3-1 defeat at the hands of Mexico in their final group game meant that they failed to progress from Group A.
