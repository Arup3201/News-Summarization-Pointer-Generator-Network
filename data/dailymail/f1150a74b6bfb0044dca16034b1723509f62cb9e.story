A shark was rescued from a certain death after it had bitten off a bit more than he could chew.

The Greenland shark was spotted choking on a two-foot long chunk of moose in a harbour in Norris Arm North, Newfoundland.

Derrick Chaulk and Jeremy Ball saw the 8ft animal and saved it by pulling the moose out of its mouth.

Mr Chaulk was the first to arrive at the scene and first thought the Greenland shark was a beached whale.

Upon closer inspection he realised what it was and saw that the shark was still alive, the moose sticking out of its mouth.

‘The moose had the fur and all the liner on it - it was about two feet long,‘ Mr Chaulk told CBS Canada.

‘He swallowed and got it halfway down and couldn't cough it back up and couldn't get it all down, and then I think the tide brought him in.’

Mr Ball joined in and began pulling at the moose, which came out after a few tugs, and together they dragged the shark out into deeper water.

After a few minutes, the shark started breathing and swum out into deeper water half-an-hour later to applause from the crowd that had gathered on the bank to follow its plight.

‘It was a good feeling to see that shark swim out, knowing that you saved his life,’ Mr Chaulk said.

The Greenland shark is not commonly found close to shore, but swim close to the bottom in the waters of the North Atlantic Ocean.

It is one of the largest sharks in the world and can grow to up to 22ft.

Its meat is poisonous and upon digestion it gives a similar effect as consuming large quantities of alcohol. it has been known to leave sled dogs unable to stand up.

On Greenland and Iceland this is overcome by drying or fermenting the meant for several months producing Hakarl, a local delicacy.
