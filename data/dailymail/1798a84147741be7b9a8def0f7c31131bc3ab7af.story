A controversial futuristic-looking advertising board dubbed the '21st Century Piccadilly Circus' was today officially announced by developers.

The London Octopus will be a 160ft-high office block resembling the sea creature when viewed from above, and covered in a staggering 6,000 sq ft of LED screens which will carry adverts.

It has been put up for sale for £120million and, despite work not yet commencing, it is thought members of the Dubai and Qatari royal families will battle it out for ownership in a bidding war.

Futuristic design: The London Octopus will be a 160ft-high office block in Chiswick, west London

New view: The building will be covered in a staggering 6,000 sq ft of LED screens which will carry adverts

Looking out: The four giant screens will be seen each day by some 1million people passing the building

The structure will be built near 
Chiswick Roundabout in West London, one of Britain’s busiest road 
junctions. The four giant screens will be seen each day by some 1million
 people passing the building.

It
 will also have 46,500 sq ft of office space, a grand double-height 
entrance lobby and underground parking. Planning permission was granted 
in 2012 despite criticism from locals and safety groups.

But developers Galliard and London & Bath Estates held off until the economy started to pick up.

The firms today said the site had been cleared and marketing would begin with The Octopus completed in two years.

Stephen Conway, chief executive of 
Galliard Group, said: ‘The London Octopus is the most futuristic and 
exciting commercial building ever launched in London.

‘The
 huge electronic advertising screens of the London octopus are like a 
21st century version of Piccadilly Circus, in an equally high profile 
west London gateway location.’

There
 is now expected to be a bidding war from two of the world's richest 
sovereign wealth funds to buy the building. Royals from both Qatar and 
Dubai are said to be eyeing up the ‘trophy’ purchase.

These
 include Her Highness Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al Missned of the Qatar 
Foundation - the wife of the ex-Emir - and His Highness Sheikh Mohammed 
bin Rashid Al Maktoum of Dubai.

2016 arrival: The developers said  marketing would begin, with The Octopus completed in two years

Long running: The Octopus would be seen by the equivalent population of the US in just 11 months. But the building only got permission following years of planning battles and disputes

The rival emirates would see the ‘landmark’ building as a jewel in their huge London property portfolios. The Qataris own Harrods, The Shard and the Olympic Village.

It would also give them a chance to promote their respective country's tourism industry and other business interests while making millions a year from potential advertising.

But the building only got permission following years of planning battles and disputes.

Some people thought it would be dangerous having giant billboards next to a busy London gateway while others feared it would set a precedent for billboard-clad buildings in the capital, eventually creating a ‘Blade Runner’-style city of the future.

Kim Gottlieb, chief executive of London & Bath Estates, added: ‘This is London's most exciting, futuristic and unusual building which can deliver a range of commercial, cultural and educational requirements.

‘Prior to the official launch of The London Octopus we have already had approaches from sovereign wealth funds and large multi-national corporations who can see the value in showcasing their various brands and businesses on the vast electronic advertising billboards.’
