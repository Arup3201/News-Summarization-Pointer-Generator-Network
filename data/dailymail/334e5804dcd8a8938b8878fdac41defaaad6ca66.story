The BBC yesterday refused to reveal how many households are dodging the licence fee by watching television programmes on the internet.

It is thought many of the one million homes which do not pay the charge watch programmes legally on internet catch-up services, such as the BBC iPlayer, which do not need a licence to use.

The loophole is believed to be costing the Corporation millions a year in lost revenue from the £145.50 annual fee.

The BBC turned down a freedom of information request asking for the number of households who had said they didn't need a licence fee

And critics accused the BBC of 
'refusing to answer legitimate questions' by concealing how many people 
were using the online loophole to avoid payment.

John Whittingdale, chairman of the 
Commons culture, media and sport committee, urged the Corporation to 
publish the figures so the public could have a 'proper debate' on the 
future of the licence fee.

The first licence fee was issued in November 1922 for radio users, and cost a princely 10 shillings (50p).

The first combined Radio/TV licence - for £2 - was issued in June 1946.

As television became popular, radio-only licences were abolished in February 1971.

The first supplementary licence fee for colour TV was introduced in January 1968.

The original iPlayer service was launched as a five-month trial in October 2005, with 5,000 broadband users testing it.

It
 was then gradually rolled out and made available to more people across 
the UK until in 2011 an international version was launched.

A television licence is not needed to watch iPlayer content after it has been broadcast.

However, the 'Watch Live' option, which broadcasts some channels simultaneously with television demands a valid TV licence.

He said: 'The licence fee was created 
when television was in a different world, when there was very little 
choice and everybody watched the BBC.

'Today people have access to hundreds of channels as well as downloads, catch-up services and on demand.

'As more and more choice is available, the arguments for having a licence fee no longer hold.

'It is important that figures for 
things like how many people are avoiding the licence fee by using 
catch-up services are released so there can be an informed discussion 
about what to do about the fee.'

Almost all the BBC's programmes are 
available on the internet catch-up service and can be viewed just a few 
minutes after they have finished on television.

Some programmes, such as a forthcoming Peter Kay sitcom, are even being made available on iPlayer first.

The idea looks set to be extended 
after the BBC approved a 12-month trial which would allow up to 40 hours
 of programming to be shown on BBC online before transmission on TV.

It means licence fee payers without 
access to iPlayer are funding programmes they cannot watch, which could 
be seen first by those who are escaping the charge.

Last year, 2.32billion TV and radio 
programmes were watched on the BBC iPlayer, a figure boosted by the 
coverage of the Olympics.

Viewers who use only the internet 
catch-up services can respond to letters from TV Licensing by making 
what it calls a 'no licence fee needed claim'.

When a newspaper submitted a freedom 
of information request, asking how many people were exploiting the 
'catch-up' loophole to avoid paying their licence fee, the BBC refused 
to reveal the figures.

It said the 'disclosure would, or 
would be likely to, prejudice the prevention or detection of crime [and]
 the collection of the licence fee'.

The Corporation said this was 
because the information would be 'of use to those seeking to evade 
paying the licence fee'.

Some programmes are even being made available on iPlayer before they are broadcast

Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers' 
Alliance, said: 'It is very disappointing that the BBC are refusing to 
answer legitimate questions.

'It is attempts to enforce the law that are 
protected in the Freedom of Information Act, not attempts to confuse 
people into paying more than they should.'

The BBC estimates that £196million of revenue was lost in 2009/10 due to licence fee evasion.

It added: 'The BBC does not anticipate
 a significant loss of income from the number of people who pay the 
licence fee due to catch-up viewing.

'The number of people watching only catch-up TV is less than 2 per cent per week.

'The licence fee model has shown 
itself resilient enjoying greater public support today than it did 20 
years ago and at 40p per day it remains good value to audiences.'

WHO NEEDS A TV LICENCE?Anyone watching or recording TV programmes on any channel as they are being broadcast. Whatever device you use to watch programmes – a TV set, computer, laptop or mobile phone – you must pay the £145.50 licence fee. Over-75s are entitled to a free licence. Anyone without a valid licence risks prosecution and a fine of up to £1,000.

WHAT CAN YOU WATCH WITHOUT ONE?Programmes on the iPlayer, the BBC’s catch-up service, provided you view them after they have been broadcast. Those using the iPlayer’s Watch Live function, which broadcasts eight channels at virtually the same time as on TV, will need a licence.

HOW MANY ARE VIEWING ONLINE TO DOGE LICENCE FEE?The BBC won’t reveal how much revenue it is losing because people watch   online but it is likely to be well into the millions. Three per cent of people don’t pay a licence fee, equal to a million households, but it’s unclear how many of them are using iPlayer.

HOW CAN BBC TELL WHO WATCHES LIVE OR CATCH-TV?It can't. It relies on honesty. Anyone not paying a licence fee has to submit a declaration that they are not watching or recording live broadcasts. Licence enforcers can make house visits to check and if your explanation is accepted, they put your account on ‘hold’ for two years, before investigating again.

COULD NON-FEE PAYERS BE CHARGED FOR iPLAYER?Possibly, but it would be complicated. The BBC could introduce a system similar to Sky, under which customers cannot watch any programmes on TV sets, laptops, or mobile devices without an ID code. However,  this would involve an enormous amount of bureaucracy. Equally, the BBC could not charge all viewers to watch iPlayer, because existing licence holders would end up paying twice for the same service.

HOW MUCH IS LIVE ON iPLAYERThe only ‘live’ programmes on iPlayer are the eight BBC channels screened on the Watch Live section, for which you still need a licence. Most other programmes are available on catch-up.
