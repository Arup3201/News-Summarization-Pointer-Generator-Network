A senior minister last night risked causing fury in Downing Street by mocking the ‘Eton mess’ at the heart of Government.

As it emerged that David Cameron has rebuked Michael Gove for highlighting the ‘preposterous’ number of old Etonians at the top of government, Baroness Warsi appeared on television with a spoof newspaper front page fuelling the row.

The Communities Minister - who attends Cabinet but is not given the full Cabinet minister status - echoed the Education Secretary’s view that there needed to be more state school pupils like her at the heart of government.

Campaign: Baroness Warsi on The Agenda with her spoof Eton Mess front page

Baroness Warsi told ITV's Agenda that she wanted to see less 'Eton Mess' and more 'bread and butter pudding' in the government

Incredibly, she appeared with a mocked up newspaper front page she apparently designed herself bearing the headline ‘Number 10 Takes Eton Mess off the Table’.

It featured a picture of David Cameron and the faces of other old Etonians in Number Ten - chief of staff Ed Llewellyn, bumbling Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin and policy chief Jo Johnson - in a pudding bowl.

Holding up the front page on ITV’s The Agenda, Lady Warsi said: 'Mine is this one, which is the story that we had earlier this week about Michael Gove talking about people at the top of the Cabinet.

'Number 10 takes Eton Mess off the menu, and replaces it with bread and butter pudding.'

Lady Warsi, the former Conservative Party
 chairman, went on: ‘Michael [Gove] was making an incredibly serious 
point that it can’t be right that the seven per cent of kids who go to 
independent school end up at the top tables, not just of politics, but 
banking and law and every other profession.’

In an extraordinary swipe at the Prime Minister and his advisers, Baroness Warsi mocked them up in a pudding bowl

She added that the Education Secretary ‘wants to create a first class, a world class state system which means that in future years you will have more pupils from state schools, people like me, around the Cabinet table and in that I fully support Michael Gove.’

Mr Gove said in a newspaper interview at the weekend that the number of old Etonians in Mr Cameron’s inner circle is ‘preposterous’.

He told the FT: ‘It doesn’t make me feel personally uncomfortable because I like each  of the individuals concerned, but  it’s ridiculous.

‘I don’t know where you can find some such similar situation in a developed economy,’

The Education Secretary has told colleagues his remarks were not meant to embarrass the Prime Minister.

They were interpreted as a jibe at London Mayor Boris Johnson, another old Etonian, since Mr Gove is said to have decided to support Chancellor George Obsorne as Mr Cameron’s successor.

Last night it emerged that Mr Gove - who won a scholarship to private Robert Gordon’s College - was admonished by the Prime Minister over the weekend for his attack on the influence of Eton.

A Cabinet source told the Mail: ‘He was b******d ’. The Education Secretary is understood to have accepted that he had blundered.

The Spectator magazine quoted another source saying Mr Gove had been ‘torn a new one’.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today insisted he was not interested in where people went to school.

The 61-year-old, who attended Greenhead Grammar School in Yorkshire, told LBC 97.3 radio: 'I'm anything but posh, but frankly I don't think you should judge somebody on where they came from and whether they went to Eton or Shenfield High.

'I'm not even slightly worried about people inside the Government who went to Eton. There are two people with ministerial responsibilities that went to Oakbank grammar school in Keighley in my department and I'm not worried about that.

'We shouldn't be worried so much about where people come from as where they are going.'

Earlier a Cabinet said that Lady Warsi’s mock front page would be seen as ‘a weak joke’.

The
 peer was said to have been furious when she was demoted as party 
chairman in the 2012 Cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister.

She
 reportedly insisted she would not remain in the Government unless her 
job at the Communities Department was augmented with another one as a 
Foreign Office minister.

Lady Warsi also clashed with Number Ten over gay marriage. She said last night she had abstained in a vote on the issue as she felt religious communities ‘needed to have the protection’ but had been on a ‘personal journey’ since.

‘You will find over time religious communities and individuals will change too… let’s allow that process to happen more naturally, rather than shoving it down people’s throats, because I think what we will end up finding is that over time people - like the Conservative Party, like David Cameron, like many of us in the Conservative Party - will start to change their position,’ she added.
