An Ohio high school music teacher has been fired for posting a racist rant on his Facebook page after catching African-American teenagers urinating near his yard.

The Akron school board on Monday accepted an investigator's report which found 51-year-old David Spondike's post violated Firestone High School's staff conduct and social media policies.

The Copley resident had been suspended with pay after an anonymous whistle blower emailed his expletive-filled Facebook tirade to several local media outlets.

The October 2013 post, which has now been deleted, said: 'I don’t mind if you come to my neighborhood from the 
ghetto to trick-or-treat.

'But when you whip out your teeny d**** and 
p*** on the telephone pole in front of my front yard and a bunch of 
preschoolers and toddlers, you can take your n*****-a** back where it 
came from. I don’t have anything against anyone of color, but n*****s, 
stay out!'

Foul-mouthed tirade: David Spondike posted this racist rant on his personal Facebook page in October 2013. It has been deleted

In a letter to the school district in November, Spondike took 'full responsibility' for the post, but asserted his right to express himself.

'It is, however, my position that I have the right to use such language in explaining my feelings about the general state of the community in Akron,' he wrote, according to Fox 8 Cleveland.

'These remarks were in no way directed at the Akron School District or, to my knowledge, any person involved in the district.'

In addition to the letter, the father has taken to social media and YouTube to defend his comments.

'I have always been clear and never minced my words on this issue,' he wrote on Facebook on October 28 last year. 'Please don't expect me to be anything less than consistent today.'

In postings which have since been deleted, the teacher warned outsiders that unruly behavior will not be tolerated. 

'Your [sic] are a CRIMINAL and are not welcome in my neighborhood and you should not be welcome in your own! THAT IS WHY YOU HAVE COME TO MINE TO TRICK OR TREAT. Do not treat my neighborhood like you do your own. I HAVE THE RIGHT NOT TO BE LIKE YOU,' he reportedly wrote.

'Racism is racism and to allow one race to use [a] word and not another IS racist. What I said was absolutely NOT racist by any stretch of the imagination.'

Decisive: The Akron school board (pictured in December 2013) accepted a referee's ruling that teacher David Spondike's post violated Firestone High School's staff conduct and social media policies

After Spondike's controversial 
Facebook posts came to light, Akron School Superintendent David James said the music history teacher offered an apology 
'to those who are sincerely offended.'

‘His
 comments were unprofessional and unbecoming a teacher,’ the 
superintendent said in a written statement, shared by WXYC.

‘Regardless of whether he 
was on his own time and own account doing this, he is a teacher; and his
 actions influence children. This is serious.'

Spondike,
 who described himself on his Twitter account as 'Father. Educator. 
Musician. Sailor,' taught at schools in the Akron School District since 1998.

In
 the early 90s, Spondike worked in television in Cincinnati, and at one 
point was an assistant director on The Jerry Springer Show.

Justification: David Spondike followed up his racist Facebook post with this defence of his actions

Over
 the past 13 years, Spondike has reportedly been investigated four times, beginning
 in 2000 when he threw a chair and used an obscenity in a classroom.

A
 year later, the music teacher was again accused of misconduct after he 
spat on the floor during class because he was angry that a student dozed
 off.

Around the same 
time, he landed in hot water for admonishing a fellow teacher for his 
failure to reprimand a student dressed in 'very baggy pants,' the 
station WKYC reported. 

In
 2007, Spondike faced allegations of pinning a student from Goodyear 
Middle School against the wall, but was ultimately cleared.

According to his Linkedin, Spondike is now a self-employed consultant designer.
