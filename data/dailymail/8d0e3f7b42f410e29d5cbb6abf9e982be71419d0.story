Suspect: Mark Speer, 44, from Indiana, faces three child molestation charges and federal child pornography counts 

The live-in girlfriend of an accused child molester from Indiana allegedly had helped the suspect arrange sexual encounters with young girls, according to recently unsealed court documents.

Mark Speer, 44, a plumber from Lafayette, was arrested in August on suspicion of molesting a 3-year-old girl and creating child pornography videos.

In the course of the investigation into the claims, police received permission to access Speer's private messages on Facebook and the dating site Zoosk exchanged between him and his girlfriend, Rebecca Kaster.

Search warrants released last month state that Kaster had assisted her boyfriend in scheduling his illicit encounters with children.

One Facebook message sent from Kaster's account to Speer December 22, 2013, read: 'i think i have the best chance getting her or the younger [girl]...so far that’s all i got.'

Speer reportedly replied that Kaster's update turned him on.

Kaster, who has not been charged with any crime, told detectives that she and Speer had an open relationship, in which he was allowed to have sex with other women he met online, according to the court documents cited by Indianapolis Star.

Speer was charged last September with child molesting, attempted child molesting and criminal confinement, along with federal child pornography charges,

The charges against the 44-year-old stemmed from the discovery of a half-dozen videos on his cell phone featuring a 3-year-old girl in his house wearing nothing but a pair of socks.

When questioned by Indiana State Police in August about the videos, Speer claimed he recorded them because the toddler was 'acting goofy' and 'dancing around.'

Court papers released last fall revealed that in one of the clips, Speer is heard saying about the child: 'This pretty little thing's mind, ' and, 'Oh my God, I’ve already got her naked.'

The suspect told police the girl's mother took off her clothes after the 3-year-old had spilled ice cream of herself.

Kaster, Speer's girlfriend, told detectives that she had been babysitting the little girl when she left her boyfriend alone with her for up to 30 minutes.
