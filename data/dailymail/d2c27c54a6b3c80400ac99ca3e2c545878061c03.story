LGBT group Charlton Rainbows have claimed that they were attacked before Saturday's Championship clash between Charlton and Brighton after being lured to a meeting which they believed would be with a like-minded group.

The group, which is made up of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Charlton fans, saw some of its members assaulted during the hoax.

Charlton Rainbows tweeted: 'Before yesterday's match, we were told to meet a group equivalent to ours. Unfortunately, this was a hoax and some members were attacked.'

'An investigation's ongoing with CCTV and statements being taken. We would like to say that the fans involved were neither #bhafc or #CAFC.'

'Our members shaken, but OK. We can't give more info as this is a criminal matter, but the thugs will be caught.'

'We would also like to thank the public who helped and the emergency services for their quick response and actions #LookAtThePositives.'

The Metropolitan Police have confirmed that they had been made aware of the incident while Sussex Police investigation the alleged assaults.
