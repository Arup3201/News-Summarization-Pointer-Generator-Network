Manchester United boosted their Champions League chances with a convincing win over Tottenham, racing into a three-goal lead in the first half before seeing the game out.

Michael Carrick bossed the midfield, before Wayne Rooney stole the show with a brilliant goal - and an even better celebration.

Sportsmail's Matt Barlow was at Old Trafford to run the rule over both sides... 

Wayne Rooney celebrates with his 'knockout' celebration as Manchester United take a three-goal lead

Manchester United 

DAVID DE GEA: A relaxed spectator from the moment he scrambled across his goal to keep out back-pass from Jones until he saved from Kane in the last minute. 6.

ANTONIO VALENCIA: Few problems of a defensive nature after his error against Arsenal and combined well with Mata in attack. 6.

CHRIS SMALLING: Few centre halves have coped so well with Kane in recent weeks. Read it well, quick into the tackle and ran the ball out with style once or twice. 7

David de Gea, who had remarkably little to do until a last-gasp save from Harry Kane, celebrates the win

PHIL JONES: Strong and assured - but for the sloppy back-pass which almost caught out De Gea in opening minutes. 6.5

DALEY BLIND: Splendid first half, raiding forward from left-back to link up with Ashley Young as United tore Spurs apart before half-time. Good delivery from wide. 7.

MICHAEL CARRICK: Took a grip of the game with two instances of clear-minded wit in the first half: a pass for Fellaini’s opener and a goal with his head to make it 2-0. 8.5.

JUAN MATA: Like Carrick making his first Premier League start for two months, playing wide on the right where he often struggles to cover the ground. Added some silky touches. 6.5.

Carrick, who also created United's first goal for Marouane Fellaini, was the best player on the pitch

ANDER HERRERA: Supplied good energy, invention and forward thrust from midfield and a key to success of the formation. 6.5.

MAROUANE FELLAINI: Huge first-half contribution. Spurs could not cope with him. One well-taken goal with his left foot and a key header in second. 7.5.

ASHLEY YOUNG: Excellent reminder of his acceleration and trickery on the left-wing. Tormented Walker in the first half as United won the game. 7.5.

Fellaini celebrates putting United into the lead with a well-placed finish in the ninth minute of the game

WAYNE ROONEY: Mobile and tireless, with wonderful vision to link up with his midfield runners. Scored a fabulous goal and may have had more. 8.

Subs: Pereira for Mata (79 min) Premier League debut. Falcao for Fellaini (83). Rafael for Carrick (87)

Manager: Louis van Gaal: Having started the season trying to cram as many attackers onto the pitch as possible, this 4-1-4-1 shape had a pleasing balance. 7.

Tottenham

HUGO LLORIS: Badly exposed by his team in the first-half. Little he could do with any of the goals, but unable to save Spurs this time. 6.

KYLE WALKER: Torrid opening 45 minutes when he could not contain the first-half threat of Young and Blind on United’s left. Not helped by his midfield 4.

ERIC DIER: Beaten in air by Fellaini for United second. Easily side-stepped by Rooney for the third. Easier after the break when United cruised. 4.5.

JAN VERTONGHEN: Perhaps the only one of the defensive unit to escape with a little credit. Even so, not able to keep United at bay. 6.

DANNY ROSE: Not the result or performance he would have wanted in front of England boss Roy Hodgson, but most of the damage done by United on the other side. 5.5.

RYAN MASON: Appeared overwhelmed by United’s intensity and the thrust of Fellaini and Herrera. Dragged right to help with Young and Blind, left holes for Fellaini to exploit. 5.

NABIL BENTALEB: Like Mason, found it impossible to get any sort of grip on the game in midfield. Awful mistake for the third goal. 5.

ANDROS TOWNSEND: A torrid half-hour. He supplied precious little protection for Walker and enjoyed little quality possession to attack. Hooked as Pochettino reshuffled. 4.

CHRISTIAN ERIKSEN: Flickers of magic from the Dane were absent. A victim of Tottenham’s inability to secure possession. 5.

NACER CHADLI: Poor clearance gave Carrick chance to score the second. Swtiched to the right after Townsend subbed to provide more solidity, which he did. 5.5.

HARRY KANE: A difficult afternoon in front of Hodgson. Ran hard as ever but was isolated and starved of the ball and it was the 89th minute before he tested De Gea. 5.

Subs: Dembele for Townsend (31) helped make Spurs a little more solid 5; Lamela for Mason (64) minimal influence 4, Adebayor for Chadli (79) out of exile to little effect.

Mauricio Pochettino may have made an early chance, but it was already too late for Tottenham on Sunday

Manger: Mauricio Pochettino: His team were stunned by United’s intense start and slow to adjust until he sent on Dembele for Townsend, by when it was too late. 5. 

Referee: Mark Clattenburg: Back at Old Trafford for Manchester United v Spurs a decade after missing the Pedro Mendes goal which crossed the line. This experience was far less controversial. 7.
