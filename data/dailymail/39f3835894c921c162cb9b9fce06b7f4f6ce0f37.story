Two dedicated Hillary Clinton supporters are launching a campaign to draft the resigning State Secretary to run for president in 2016.

The group ‘Ready for Hillary’ filed as a super-PAC (political action committee) with the Federal Election Commission late last week in the first notable effort from an outside group to campaign on Clinton’s behalf.

Allida Black and Judy Beck, two long-time Clinton supporters who were on Clinton’s Virginia Women’s Steering Committee in 2008 and helped her raise more than $100,000, are spearheading the effort, Washington, D.C.-based newspaper The Hill reports on its blog.

The two also lead Women Count, a political action committee that sponsored ads fighting against calls for Clinton to resign early from the 2008 presidential race against Barack Obama.

Black and Beck’s group plans to roll out a website for their ‘Ready for Hillary’ PAC in the upcoming weeks, they said.

‘This is not our first campaign. We know how to raise money. Most of us who are involved have done fundraisers before,’ Black told the Hill.

‘I certainly have had fundraisers for her at my house in Virginia. We're there to mobilize support for her in a variety of forms, both financial and grassroots. We're getting ready so that when she's ready, we've got the resources to help her do it.’

The duo said that about a dozen veterans of the 2008 Clinton presidential campaign were involved with their newly formed group. Most of those members are volunteers, fundraisers and committee delegates, rather than members of Clinton’s internal circle, they said.

Resigning: Clinton steps down from her role as State Secretary on Friday

The group’s Facebook page says a ‘former aide’ and ‘former adviser’ to Clinton are both involved in the efforts.

Black said ‘the fireworks will begin’ when the group rolls out their pro-Clinton website in the next week or two, after Clinton officially steps down from her role as State Secretary.

She told The Hill that she hasn’t seen Clinton in a year or so and doubted she had yet heard about the group’s efforts.

Black said the group’s aim would not be to raise tons of money, but instead ‘to sustain a really devoted, organized following to support her run for president both on the ground and with whatever funds they can donate.’

‘This is not Hillaryland,’ Black said. ‘I love Hillaryland. I was not officially part of Hillaryland; I was a volunteer. I worked with her on specific issues, which is one of the reasons why I'm so devoted to her candidacy.’

Clinton’s popularity ratings among Democrats and the broader electorate are soaring as talks of her potential run for president fuel further speculation on whether or not she will.

Clinton steps down from her role as State Secretary on Friday.

Dismissing speculation: Clinton recently appeared with President Obama on '60 Minutes' to fan the flames of expectations that she is going to run for his job in four years
