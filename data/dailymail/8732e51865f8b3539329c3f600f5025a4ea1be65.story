Thousands of thrill-seekers kicked up a storm in dune buggies on the Imperial Sand Dunes to celebrate Thanksgiving.

Also known as the Algodones Dunes, the Glamis California desert scene plays host to an annual, yet free-form celebration where people let loose in an array of colourful vehicles.

Visitors flocked to the mounds of golden sand which have accumulated in the far corner of the south east of the state - around 150,000 people attended in 2011 and this year is estimated to have a similar turn-out.

Sand spray: A dune buggy races across the hot desert floor of the Imperial Sand Dunes in Glamis, California, where riders meet for the Thanksgiving holiday

Thrill-seekers: Thousands upon thousands of people turned up to have a riotous time in the otherwise barren desert area, armed with their vehicles and plenty of petrol

On the brow of the hill: Racers line up at the top of a sand dune while one cuts across below

Ups and downs: The buggy on the left hits the bottom of a dune while the bike rider on the right has a long way to go back up

Waves of buggies, bikes and trucks 
tackled the desert terrain, leaping over ridges and causing sand to arc 
up and spray everywhere in spectacular fashion.

The dunes stretch for eight miles by 
40, holding no vegetation and tends to appear as a block colour scene - 
clear blue sky above, bright gold sand below.

There were no officially planned races or events and there are no titles to be won; everybody turns up simply to tear up the desert.

The smell of burning petrol accompanies the buggies which travel at break-neck speed around the dunes.

Turn up: Around 150,000 people tend to make their way to the dunes for Thanksgiving and this year's turn-out appeared to be similar

Illumination: Buggies have light-sticks attached to them as they continue the fun at night

Block colours: The blue, cloudless sky above and the golden sand below is the typical way the Glamis desert looks, before the riders fill it with colour

When the night comes the riders strap 
lights to their vehicles and continue, illuminating the desert in 
different shades of neon.

Officials encourage riders of the 
off-highway vehicles to buckle up - it is not uncommon for deaths to 
occur during the exciting celebration.

'Each year, serious injury and death 
could have been prevented with the use of these safety restraints,' said
the bureau of land management's field manager Margaret Goodro.

'A safety campaign urging visitors to "Restrain Yourself" has been ongoing since the start of the season.'

From January 1, 2013, new health and 
safety laws will require all riders to wear a safety harness or seat 
belt and be 16 or over, unless directly supervised.

Spread out: The area is eight by 40 miles and the buggies and bikes line up as far as the eye can see

Stars and stripes: This buggy carries the flag of the United States as it goes about its business in the sand

Lined up: Sand duners relaxing before the party really kicks off on the Algodones Dunes

Glowing tracks: Riders create bright paths of light amid the sand which spans the floor of the desert region

Good health: There has, at the time of writing, been no deaths reported at the 2012 Thankgiving meet at the Imperial Sand Dunes

Party time: The gathered crowd watches as a rider whizzes by on his small quad-bike style vehicle

Big boy: This mini bus was one of the larger vehicles to dare to enter the desert

Lightsabers: Riders have a campfire in front of an array of glowing vehicles

Dusky orange: One rider pulls up the front of his buggy as he whizzes across the sand to create a gritty orange trail in his wake

Holiday tradition: Some riders like to cook a turkey at the dunes and there are instructions on how to at GlamisOnline.org
