A German car museum has visitors flocking to an unlikely attraction within its walls - the world’s strongest man-made tornado.

The Mercedes-Benz museum’s state-of-the-art fire safety system was created to effectively dispel smoke in case of a fire, but has tourists lined up to watch it go.

The ‘indoor storm’ is created by 144 jet motors which align the walls up to the ceiling, 112ft above the central atrium.

Unintentional attraction: The world's strongest man-made tornado can be found inside a museum in Stuttgart, Germany and is, in fact, a fire safety measure

Safety measure: The 'indoor tornado' at the Mercedes-Benz Museum, was initially created to expel smoke emissions in the event of a fire

Higher power: The tornado is powered by 144 jet motors which line the walls up to the vents 112ft up

Although intended as a safety measure,
 the man-made tornado has proven to be an audience attraction at the car
 company’s museum in Stuttgart, Germany.

Using a smoke machine, staff power up 
the motors in front of visitors, who are able to view the spectacle from
 the spiralling floor levels that surround the atrium.

It takes seven minutes to whirl 28 tons of potentially hazardous smoke through the roof vents in a 112ft high tornado.

The Mercedes-Benz Museum, designed by 
Dutch architectural design studio UNStudio, functions as a modern 
exhibition space and also features over 150 Mercedes-Benz vehicles.

Strong force: The man-made air vortex is located in the atrium and had become a tourist attraction in its own right as staff uses a smoke machine to display its power

Smokin: It takes the tornado seven minutes to dispel 28 tons of smoke from inside the building

Twist and turn: Although the Mercedes-Benz museum is meant to be focused on cars, all eyes are on the tornado
