Shoppers raced to order free pairs of Reebok running shoes when a website glitch meant they were only charged for delivery.

Thousands of customers are thought to have taken advantage of the bug after it went viral on Facebook and internet sports forums.

It meant they were able to fill their shopping basket with the £99.95 CrossFit Nano Speed footwear but pay just £8.50 postage.

The loophole - which was closed a short while later - affected trainers which people could customise with their own colours and name.

So many people tried to place an order that the website slowed to a crawl.

Reebok today revealed they will not honour the orders and will instead offer customers a 20 per cent discount on the site.

One bargain-hunter, who ordered four pairs at Reebok.co.uk, said: 'A friend told me she had gone onto the website to order a pair of running shoes and was surprised when she was only billed for delivery.

'I logged on straight away, choose which sizes I wanted, and set about changing the colours to suit my dad, boyfriend, and two brothers.

'It should have cost me 400 pounds plus delivery, but when I placed my order I was only billed 8.50 pounds.'I even received an email confirming my order.

'It’s disappointing that Reebok are not honouring the deal, because I thought I had half of my Christmas shopping sorted.”

Customers who were still designing their shoes at the time the bug was fixed were presented with an error message when they tried to place their order.

It said: 'Your shopping cart can currently not be ordered since one or more of the products in your cart have an invalid price or are not available in the request quantity.

'If you have any questions, please contact customer service.'

A Reebok spokesman said: 'There was an IT glitch resulting in the YourReebok CrossFit Nano Speed shoes being incorrectly priced on Reebok.co.uk at £0.00 instead of £99.95.

'Clearly, it was not Reebok’s intention to offer this product for free.

'In accordance with the Reebok Delivery Terms and applicable law unfortunately we are unable to fulfil these orders.

'We have apologised to the consumers affected and offered them a one-off discount of 20 per cent, which they can redeem at Reebok.co.uk to mitigate any inconvenience that this error may have caused.'
