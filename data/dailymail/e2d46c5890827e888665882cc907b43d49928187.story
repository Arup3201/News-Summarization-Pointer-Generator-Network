A man who executed his wife and three children in their SUV will spend the rest of his life in prison after being found guilty of their brutal murders.

Christopher Vaughn, 37, was sentenced on Tuesday to four consecutive life terms for killing his wife Kimberly, 34, and children Abigayle, 12, Cassandra, 11 and eight-year-old Blake.

Each child was shot once in the chest and head while buckled into the back seat. They were killed moments after watching their mother be shot in the face.

Vaughn murdered his family by the roadside in June 2007 as they  drove to an Illinois water park. He had harbored fantasies of starting a new life alone in the Canadian wilderness and viewed his family as the obstacle standing in his way.

Justice: Del Phillips, father of murder victim Kimberly Vaughn, speaks after sentencing with his wife Susan and Kimberly's twin sister Jennifer Ledbetter

No remorse: Christopher Vaughn expressed no emotion as he listened to the devastating testimony of his wife's parents and sister

The victims' family spoke outside court in Joliet of their relief that the trial was over but were  devastated that Vaughn had
shown no remorse for taking his family's lives.

Kimberly's mother Susan Phillips said now that the family had seen justice they 'can begin to really get with the process of grieving'.

Her husband Del Phillips said: 'We had no indication from this individual that he could be so evil or do such acts but we did find out the hard way.'

Mr Phillips added: 'I don't think he felt what we feel when he held our (grand)children', according to the Chicago Tribune.

Alongside the couple sat their daughter Jennifer Ledbetter who is Kimberly's twin sister. She was so overcome with emotion at the press conference that she could not speak.

At Vaughn's sentencing, Mrs Ledbetter 
broke down when she told of the 'indescribable 
pain' of losing her sister, to whom she bears a striking resemblance, 
and her nieces and nephew.

Outside the court, the prosecution team said that the murders were a 'diabolical atrocity' committed by a 'heartless, soulless psychopath'.

The judge sentenced Vaughn to four consecutive life sentences with no possibility of parole after he was found guilty on September 20. A jury took less than an hour to convict the computer specialist.

He was eligible for the death penalty when the case began but Illinois has since abolished capital punishment.

Vaughn did not make a statement in court on Tuesday but turned to watch his family as they left the room.

On June 
14, 2007, Vaughn ordered his family into their SUV at 5am before pulling
off the road and placing a 9mm pistol under his wife's chin and firing a
shot.

He then turned to each of his three children buckled in the back seat and 
fired, once in the chest and once in the head for each of them.

Abigayle was found holding a stuffed animal and a copy of Harry Potter while Blake's wounds indicated he had raised his arm to shield himself.

According to Christopher Vaughn's account, the family had been headed on a trip and he had stopped to secure luggage on the roof of the vehicle. He told police that his wife started shooting shortly after that and he fled the scene to survive.

The married father was arrested at a funeral home hours before a memorial service for his wife and children.

Prosecutors said Vaughn had dreamed of starting a new life in the Canadian wilderness and viewed his family as what was holding him back. He posted wistful 
Internet messages about building a cabin and settling in the Yukon woods, cut 
off from the world.

'He was held back by four major 
obstacles,' prosecutor Chris Regis said. 'Those four obstacles were 
eliminated on June 14, 2007.'

The court was read emails Vaughn wrote to a friend before the murders 
saying he longed for a life unencumbered by cellphones and other 
hallmarks of modernity.

He cited poet Henry David Thoreau about the 
virtue of shrugging off obligations. 'I just want to live plain and simple,' Vaughn wrote in one email.

Jurors also heard from an exotic dancer Maya Drake who testified that Vaughn had visited Scores Gentlemen's Club where she worked in the weeks before the murders. 

She described how Vaughn came to the Chicago strip club on four or five occasions and had discussed a feud he had with his wife over expensive drapes that she ordered for their home.

Vaughn was said to be enraged that his wife was materialistic and he shared how he dreamed of breaking free of all responsibility for his family.

'He told me that he wanted to leave his wife and move to Canada and build his own home or cabin in the woods,' Drake said. 'He said [his wife] was going to get what she deserved. She wasn't going to see it coming.'

Vaughn had been stockpiling wilderness gear, according to police. Officers uncovered a storage unit he had rented that was full of camping gear, tin cups and plates, sleeping bags, boots and camp tools in addition to a jar of peanut butter and a bottle of Jameson whiskey.

Another stripper, Chrystal Miller, had testified in late August about Vaughn's visit to the club, describing him as a 'very timid'  customer.

She said he spent upwards of $5,000 each on two visits to the establishment, in the weeks before his family's murder.

Emotionless: Vaughn sat passive throughout most of his trial which described in horrifying detail the murders of his wife and young children

Blame: Vaughn's defense team claimed his wife was suicidal and had killed her husband and children but jurors did not buy it

Vaughn displayed little emotion during the trial, even when prosecutors displayed crime-scene photos of his wife, her head hanging back and dried blood from her nose and mouth.

The defense told 
jurors that Vaughn's wife was to blame, saying she was suicidal over their marriage problems and affected emotionally by antidepressant medication.

They suggested she shot her husband in the wrist and 
leg, then killed the children and herself.

Vaughn's defense attorney added later that Kimberly Vaughn may have seen the murder of her kids as a twisted act of mercy.

'(She)
was of the mindset that they if she was gone, they were better off with
her ... "Come with me to heaven,"' Lenard said.

Prosecutors balked at that theory, 
asking jurors whether it seemed reasonable that a woman who disliked guns
could have shot her husband twice - only grazing him each time - but then killed each of her children with marksman's precision.

In closing statements, prosecutors said 
Kimberly Vaughn was upbeat in the days before her death.

The night before her brutal murder, she had fussed cheerfully over a recipe for 'cheesy potatoes' at the family's spacious home in the Chicago suburbs.

'This case is not just a murder, it's an
atrocity,' said Will County State Attorney James Glasgow said in 
closing. 'To annihilate your family, I can't think of a more despicable 
crime.'
