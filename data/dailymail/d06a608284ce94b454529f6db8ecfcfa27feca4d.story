The father of the pregnant Hasidic woman who died on her way to hospital in a violent car-crash in the early hours of Sunday spoke of his agony at her funeral Sunday.

'God is punishing me for my sins by taking away my daughter,' said 21-year-old Raizi Glauber’s father, Yitzchak Silberstein, in Yiddish at the emotional service on Sunday afternoon in New York.

Glauber's husband, Nachman, also died in the horror smash after the two expectant Brooklyn parents were rushing to hospital when seven-month pregnant Raizi began to suffer unusual pain.

Jewish law calls for burial of the dead as soon as possible, and hours after their deaths, the Glaubers were mourned at an emotional funeral on Sunday

Nachman and Raizi were traveling in a vlack 2008 Toyota Camry livery cab to Long Island College Hospital in Cobble Hill when a BMW smashed into the car and fatally injured the would-be parents - the male and female passenger of the BMW ran away from the scene.

The couple's child was born by C-Section later at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan - their boy is expected to survive.

Paramedic Yisroel Altman said he initially believed both husband and wife could survive, but their head injuries were just too much.

'I’ve seen worse cases [car accidents], it was the knock on the head that killed them,' said Altman to the New York Post, adding that Raizi was responsive in the ambulance until a few minutes before she arrived at Bellevue.

The funerals of the young Orthodox Jewish couple, both 21, who died in a horrific car crash took place on Sunday

Jewish law calls for the burial of the dead as soon as possible and at least 1,000 people gathered at Yetev Lev D'Satmar synagogue in Brooklyn to pay their respects to the Glaubers.

The NYPD are searching for the driver and passenger of the gray BMW which crashed into the Glauber's taxi at around 12.30 a.m. according to police.

The couple had just married in January of last year.

The impact from the t-bone smash sent Raizi out into the street where her body came to rest under a parker tractor trailer, while first responders had to cut the roof off the taxi to rescue Nachman and the taxi cab driver.

While Nachman sadly died, the driver of the vehicle was held overnight and released home with no serious injuries.

At the funeral today Rabbi Zalman Leib Teitelbaum, speaking in Yiddish addressed the mourners.

'Its a great tragedy for the community,' said Teitelbaum.

'We have to hold on together and see what we can do to make things better. This is a very, very big tragedy.'

There was shock at the funeral services of Nachman and Raizi Glauber, who were survived by their seven-month-old son

Raizi's brother, Yitzchak Silberstein, spoke of his devastation at his sister's tragic passing to the New York Daily News.

'She was the crown of the family,' said Silberstein. 'We were sitting together last night and today she’s gone.'

He was full of praise for his brother-in-law too. 'We can all learn from him how to treat a wife,' he said. 'The way he treated her was special.'

The driver of a BMW slammed into the 
car carrying Nachman and Raizi Glauber, both 21, at an intersection in 
the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn.

Their baby boy was delivered by emergency caesarean and survived, yet remains in a serious condition in hospital.

The funerals took place in Brooklyn, which is home to the largest 
community of ultra-orthodox Jews outside Israel, more than 250,000.

The 
community has strict rules governing clothing, social customs and 
interaction with the outside world. Men wear dark clothing that includes
a long coat and a fedora-type hat and often have long beards and ear 
locks.

Hundreds of members of the Satmar community gathered shoulder to 
shoulder on the street outside, men in hats and women in shawls or head 
coverings, nearly everyone in black.

The sound of wailing filled the 
street as the two black-draped coffins were carried from a vehicle.

After the funeral began, a speaker 
sobbed uncontrollably, his voice choked with grief and echoing over 
loudspeakers set up outside.

Just before, Nachman Glauber's cousin, Sara Glauber, said of her relative and his bride, 'if one had to go, the other had to go too because they really were one soul.'

Sara spoke admiringly of her cousin. 'You don't meet anyone better than him,' she said. 'He was always doing favors for everyone.'

She said Nachman's mother herself just delivered a baby two weeks ago.

'I've never seen a mother-son 
relationship like this,' said Sara Glauber. 'He called her every day to 
make sure everything was OK.

'He was the sweetest, most charming human 
being, always with a smile on his face.'

During the accident Raizi Glauber was 
thrown from the car
and her body landed under a parked tractor-trailer, said witnesses who 
came to the scene after the crash.

Nachman Glauber was pinned in the 
car, and emergency workers had to cut off the roof to get him out, 
witnesses said. Both died of blunt-force trauma, the medical examiner said.

The
Glaubers' driver was in stable condition, police said. Both the driver 
of the BMW and a passenger fled and were being sought, said officers.

On Saturday, Raizi Glauber 'was not feeling well, so they decided to go' to the hospital, said Sara Glauber.

Abraham said the Glaubers called a car service because they didn't own a car, which is common for New Yorkers.

The Glaubers were married about a 
year ago and had begun a life together in Williamsburg, where Raizi 
Glauber grew up in a prominent Orthodox Jewish rabbinical family, Sara 
Glauber said.

Raised north of New York City in 
Monsey, N.Y., and part of a family that founded a line of clothing for 
Orthodox Jews, Nachman Glauber was studying at a rabbinical college 
nearby, said his cousin.

A spokesman for the Orthodox Jewish community described the couple's death as 'a tragedy beyond (belief) just coming off a joyous holiday as Purim' as they were getting ready to welcome their first child
