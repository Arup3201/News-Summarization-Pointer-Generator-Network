No vote: Miliband says Labour will only hold an EU referendum if Westminster is asked to hand over more power to Brussels

Ed Miliband faced an onslaught from both Tory and Labour Eurosceptics last night after effectively ruling out an EU referendum if he becomes prime minister.

The Labour leader ended a year of dithering over the issue by announcing that he will refuse to match Prime Minister David Cameron’s pledge to hold an ‘in/out’ vote by 2017.

He said Labour would only offer people a say in the event of a new EU treaty in which Westminster is asked to hand over more powers to Brussels, something even he admitted was ‘unlikely’ to happen.

Mr Miliband’s stance brings Labour 
policy into line with that of the Liberal Democrats, prompting 
speculation he is preparing the ground for a potential coalition deal if
 he fails to win a majority in next year’s general election.

Tories
 expressed delight, saying they could now tell voters only they were 
prepared to offer the public their first say on EU membership for 40 
years in the next Parliament.

They
 also said it should now be obvious to Eurosceptic voters that backing 
UKIP risks letting in a Labour government which will not hold a 
referendum.

A recent YouGov 
poll found 62 per cent of Britons wanted a referendum, against 21 per 
cent who did not. Among Labour voters, the figures were 49 per cent and 
33 per cent.

Mr Cameron 
said: ‘The British people now have a very, very clear choice. They can 
elect a Tory government that will renegotiate Britain’s position in 
Europe and give people a guaranteed in/out referendum by the end of 
2017. If they get a Labour government they get no referendum, no choice,
 nothing.’

Labour MPs agitating for the party to back a vote attacked what one called a ‘shoddy compromise’.

Meanwhile
 one of the party’s biggest donors, John Mills, who is also chairman of 
the Labour for a Referendum campaign, said: ‘I want to see a Labour 
government in 2015 and, as the party that trusts the people, I think we 
should recognise that the growth of the EU’s influence over Britain in 
the past 40 years warrants a referendum.’

Labour MP Graham Stringer said: ‘It’s a 
shoddy compromise, between those in the Parliamentary Labour Party who 
want a referendum because the vast majority of the electorate want it, 
and those desperate not to have a referendum.’

Labour sources claimed Mr Miliband had overruled senior figures including Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, police chief Jon Cruddas and former shadow Cabinet minister Tom Watson.

Former Labour minister Kate Hoey, a Eurosceptic, said: ‘I think it’s meant to be a clever compromise, I don’t think it’s going to end up as one.’

Mr Miliband acknowledged concerns about the EU and said he would seek to return ‘more control to national parliaments’.

His announcement divided business groups, with the Confederation of British Industry praising him for giving businesses certainty over Britain’s future in the EU but the Institute of Directors insisting a referendum must be held.

Lord Mandelson, the former Labour business secretary, said: ‘I think it will be seen as quite a game-changer for Ed Miliband. He’s shown judgment, and courage.’

Former foreign secretary Jack Straw said: ‘This offers reassurance not only to business and millions of workers whose jobs depend on Europe but also allays the fears of those who are uncomfortable with moves towards ever closer union.’

But the chairman of the all-party Parliamentary group for an EU referendum, John Baron, said: ‘Labour has come up short. The leadership has all but said there will never be an in/out referendum on their watch. Only the Conservatives will be able to deliver such a referendum.’
