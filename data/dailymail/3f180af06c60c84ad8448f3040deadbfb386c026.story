In Iraq's national museum, home to some of the world's most precious artefacts of ancient Mesopotamia, a caption beside a skeleton simply reads in English: 'dated to very old time.'

And some of the museum's most impressive pieces carry no labels at all - like a giant stone head lying on the ground that may or may not belong on a nearby empty pedestal labelled 'Assyrian King Nimrod,' the Biblical tormentor of the patriarch Abraham.

Ten years after Iraq's national museum was looted and smashed by thieves during the US-led invasion in 2003 to topple Saddam Hussein, it is still far from ready to reopen to the public.

A sign next to a skeleton in Iraq's national museum says it is 'dated to very old time'. The staff face the problem of not having enough background about the museum's collection and an incomplete inventory

Among the treasures that survived the looting is this lion, symbolising Ishtar, the goddess of love and war. The panel came from the Ishtar gate, Babylon and dates back to the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II from 605-562BC

Work to overcome decades of neglect and the destruction of war has been hindered by power struggles, poorly-skilled staff and the persistent violence plaguing the country, said Bahaa Mayah, Iraq's most senior antiquities official.

'I wish that the great historical Baghdad would appear in her finest face and that the Iraq museum opens,' said Mayah, the head of antiquities in the Tourism and Antiquities Ministry.

'But our wishes crash against the unfortunate reality we live in.'

The museum was once the showcase for 7,000 years of history in Mesopotamia, birthplace of some of the first cities and one of the first writing systems - cuneiform - and home to a succession of major civilisations, including the Sumerian, Babylonian and Assyrian, through to a flourishing Islamic empire.

The museum was left a wreck the day after Baghdad fell to US troops on April 10, 2003.

Ancient clay scrolls and pottery littered the floor. Looters made off with everything from gold bowls and ritual funeral masks to elaborate headdresses.

The US was sharply criticised for not protecting the museum.

Recovered statues from the 2003 looting

Because the museum's inventory was never completed, it is uncertain how many pieces were stolen, but the number is estimated at 15,000 pieces.

More than a quarter have been retrieved, said Mayah, who has overseen the museum formally since 2012 but has been involved in its renovations for the past five years.

Work began soon after the museum was smashed up in 2003, starting with the basics, such as computers, office furniture, air conditioning.

By mid-2004, the museum was rewired for electricity and most basic repairs to its structure completed.

Since then, the US and Italian governments have helped renovate the halls.

But work has been slow. Only five of 
30 exhibition halls have been renovated so far - and two of those have 
to be done again because they were improperly done.

As
a result, the museum is still not open to the general public. Its only 
visitors are specially arranged foreign delegations, Iraqi officials and
field trips by Iraqi students.

It is
part of a broader problem of preservation of antiquities in Iraq.

There
are over 12,000 registered archaeological sites in Iraq but they are 
mostly not protected, allowing for widespread, ongoing looting, Mayah told the Associated Press.

The museum itself 
was shut from the early 1990s by regime officials who said they 
feared for its safety, as Saddam mired the country in war, leading to 
crippling sanctions.

The
closure meant the museum's inventory wasn't updated. Sanctions meant 
staff couldn't update their skills, and many qualified employees left 
amid an exodus of Iraqis from the country.

Tens of thousands of artefacts chronicling some 7,000 years of civilisation in Mesopotamia are believed to have been looted from Iraq in the chaos which followed the US-led invasion ten years ago

Despite international efforts, fewer than half of the missing artefacts have so far been found and returned to the museum

In a central Baghdad quarter, the museum is surrounded by high concrete blast walls.

Guards check bags in a caravan set up in the neglected museum garden. The main entrance is under construction, so visitors enter through a corridor leading to administrative rooms.

An Associated Press reporter said the renovated exhibition halls were eerily quiet, with gleaming floors and shining display cases, the artefacts encased neatly inside.

The sound of workers employing drills was palpable as they renovated another hall. A ladder was strewn under a map of ancient Mesopotamia.

Two of the renovated rooms are meant to showcase the Sumerian civilization, which emerged some 3,000 years ago.

But the labels on the artefacts shed little light on the antiquities that represent some of humankind's most important milestones.

Many labels lacked the age of the artefact, where it was found, what civilisation it belonged to, or what its use was.

Some didn't have labels at all. Nowhere in the hall - or anywhere else - is it explained who the Sumerians were or how they influenced later civilisations.

In one of the displays lay a skeleton in the earth it was found in, alongside rings and jars.

A printed label beside it read: 'A human skeleton found in situ, put beside him some jars and rings between him dated to very old time.'

The label on a fist-sized figurine of a monkey clutching his ears simply identifies it as 'some monkey.'

A hand-sized stone carving in one display case was described as 'the legendary hero Gilgamesh wrestling with two lions, early 3rd millennium,' with no further explanation of who Gilgamesh was - the Sumerian hero-king of one of the first written stories in history.

UK-based Iraqi archaeologist Lamia 
al-Gailani, who is following the renovations, said labels were lacking 
because the outdated inventory didn't list the pieces and the staff, 
lacking expertise, weren't familiar with the pieces' background.

A
US State Department official advising on the renovation said it was 
better to display the pieces imperfectly than keep them hidden.

But
more problematic and confusing, is that the displays in the Sumerian 
halls mix in artefacts from the later Babylonian era, as well as from 
the Neanderthals, an entirely different hominid species from homo 
sapiens that died out some 30,000 years ago.

Mayah
said the two halls would be renovated again this year. Sometime this 
year, he hopes, all the finished halls can be opened to the general 
public.

Other renovated halls fared better. Displays in the hall on Baghdad's Islamic dynasty were clear.

Another hall explained the significance of the 5,000 year-old Arab city of Hatra, adorned with rare statues.

The items still under the museum's care include this Bronze Age carved stone vessel found in the Ur area

Other treasures include a limestone slab depicting the water god, Ea, receiving a minor deity

Stone figures depicting the family of Sanatruq I, the king of Hatra, found at the site of the ancient city

Another find from Hatra, this limestone statue of a cloaked woman

The museum's prize is the soaring Assyrian hall, chronicling the kingdom that rose to become a major empire in the region in the 2nd and 1st millennia B.C.

The hall is lined with stone etchings of giant winged creatures and statues of hand-clasped Assyrian kings.

Yet even here, at the hall's rear, lay the unidentified broken stone head the size of an exercise ball, bearded and wearing a crown. Nearby stood an empty pedestal labeled for a statue of Nimrod.

'Even the renovations that have been done are disappointing. I won't compare it to the great museums of the world, but still - it's way behind,' said a UN adviser to the museum who spoke anonymously, not wishing to offend local staff.

Turf battles over the museum haven't helped.

The culture ministry and tourism ministry both claimed authority over the museum in 2005, confusing staff and delaying renovations.

The body that directly oversees the museum - the State Antiquities Authority - was leaderless from 2006 onwards.Â 

In 2012, the Iraqi parliament finally definitively put the museum under the tourism ministry.

Ongoing
violence, particularly suicide bombings hitting Baghdad during most of 
the past ten years, has also kept away foreign experts who could have 
helped speed the process, said al-Gailani.

The violence also means tourists are staying away from Iraq, reducing the incentive for staff to speed up renovations.

One US official said it was better for the museum to display the items with imperfect details rather than hide them away

If the museum had stayed closed, more than 7,000 years of Mesopotamian history would be hidden from the world

Although Iraq is relatively safer since the height of violence in 2007, there are still frequent attacks against government institutions, mostly the hallmark of al Qaeda.

Ultimately, the museum didn't have to be world-class, said al-Gailani.

'The antiquities are so unique and rich, sometimes you forget if they are exhibited well or not,' she said.

The museum's woes mattered little to a visiting group of Iraqi schoolgirls. They rushed into the room, gaping at the statues, taking notes.

'It's not like television,' said Sawsan Kadhim, 19. 'Now if somebody says something about our history, I can say I saw it in reality.'
