Every Christmas, one Manchester United player could be counted upon to give out presents to 30 or more staff at the club's training ground as a personal thank you for their work and friendship during the year.

Darren Fletcher's deadline day free transfer to West Bromwich Albion won't have made the global headlines of Cristiano Ronaldo's world-record move to Real Madrid, for example, but nobody will be more sorely missed than the 31-year-old Scot who has left Old Trafford after 12 memorable years.

Fletcher would banter with the canteen ladies, enquire about the families of the ground staff and away from the club would be seen shopping on the high street in Hale with his two young boys just like any other family man.

If anybody can be said not to have let fame and wealth go to his head, it is Fletcher. And that, in addition to his 340 first-team appearances, is what he will be best remembered within the inner sanctum at United.

United's official Twitter account wished him well

The way he came back from a career-threatening illness, ulcerative colitis, also endeared him to the greater United family who were so desperately worried about the thinning figure in front of them, there was almost relief when the condition was announced rather than it being a terminal illness.

In many ways, Fletcher was a historical figure, the last of the “Fergie fledglings” who was personally wooed by Sir Alex to ensure he ended up at United from Scotland rather than a clutch of other clubs who wanted him.

Ferguson played snooker with Fletcher at his house as he sought to sign him. He saw him as a long-term successor to David Beckham who was at the time on his way to Real Madrid. Fletcher could pass, get around the pitch, and had the mental strength not to be overawed by playing for England's biggest club.

After Fletcher, the game changed – young stars could come in from around the world and in any case Ferguson got older and would start to spend more time delegating than personally overseeing the signings of the next big thing.

We're now seeing Fletcher in the context of his brave battle with his condition – it was so serious at one point he needed an operation to stop the risk of his bowel exploding, and he didn't play for a year after Boxing Day 2012 – but it is worth remembering he was a fantastic player at his peak, with his best season probably coming in 2008/09.

Fletcher enjoyed a memorable 12 years at Manchester United in which he appeared 342 times

Sir Alex Ferguson personally secured the signature of the young Scot amid interest from other clubs

With Owen Hargreaves injured, Fletcher was one of the star performers during a season which saw United win their third Premier League title in a row and reach the Champions League final.

Ferguson at the time said Fletcher had become 'a key performer for us in major games.'

The only cloud was he missed the final itself for a red card sustained against Arsenal in the semi. Typically, he dealt with the setback in such an unfussy manner it is barely remembered compared to Roy Keane and Paul Scholes being suspended for the 1999 final. Nonetheless, United badly missed his drive in midfield as Xavi and Andres Iniesta dominated and Barcelona easily won 2-0 in Rome.

Not surprisingly, Fletcher hasn't been quite the same player since returning from his illness even though he has made 13 appearances this season.

Manager Louis van Gaal wanted Fletcher to remain – his influence in a dressing-room of so many new signings was huge – but the club felt they couldn't stand in the player's way if he wanted first-team football, an attitude the Scot is grateful for.

Fletcher's work with charity, including the Manchester United Foundation, has also bee recognised

Spain keeper David de Gea isn't alone among new additions at Old Trafford to hold Fletcher in high regard

'Manchester United are a fantastic club and I've got so many great memories there but I feel it's time for a new challenge for me,' he has said following his move to join Tony Pulis at The Hawthorns.

'I haven't had as many games as I would like this season and, after everything I've been through, I'm a professional football player. I want to play football and hopefully I can do that at West Brom. They've given me the opportunity to do that.

'I'm leaving Manchester United but I've got so many happy memories and got to know so many great people there I'm leaving with a smile on my face.

'I spoke to the manager [Louis van Gaal] about not playing as much as I wanted and the club didn't really want me to go but they respected my wishes.

Fletcher is mobbed by team-mates including Wayne Rooney after scoring  during a pre-season friendly against Valencia, however, he went on to appear just 13 times this season with only five starts

Fletcher's move has't garnered the attention that met Cristiano Ronaldo's world-record departure, but nobody will be more sorely missed than the 31-year-old Scotland international

'The manager and (executive vice chairman) Ed Woodward have been fantastic. I cannot speak highly enough of them. I have great respect for them and how they have dealt with this. They helped me as much as possible and made the move possible. I have to thank them for being professional and catering for my wishes.'

Fletcher won five Premier League titles with United and has a Champions League winners' medal as an unused substitute from the 2008. But his real legacy at the club is the hearts and minds he won over.

His international team-mate Barry Bannan once described Fletcher as the “Daddy” of the Scotland team. 'You look up to him because of what he's done,' said Bannan.

It could equally apply at Manchester United. Has there ever have been a more popular player in the club's history among work colleagues, both on and off the pitch?
