Subaru Emirates has been forced to apologise after a post on its Facebook page blamed a fatal car crash on 'women drivers'.

The status said the collision in Dubai on Thursday that killed four people was 'women driver at it again' (sic).

The post, which has since been deleted, prompted a furious backlash from users online, who accused the car company of sexism.

Subaru Emirate's Facebook page claimed the fatal crash was caused by 'women driver at it again'

Some internet commenters said the incident 'will go down in history as one of the most notable social media fails'.

Many have vowed to boycott the car company in protest.

A woman had broken down in the middle of the road after puncturing a tyre before the crash happened.

On the Facebook page of the car company's Emirates website, the writer said 'extra parameters' cannot be put in place 'for women to check their presence of mind'.

The post read: 'Women driver at it again… An entire family has perished as a 
result of a grave mistake by a lady driver on SZR this weekend.

'A Jordanian woman parked her car right in the middle of the road on 
Sheikh Zayed motorway after it suffered from a tyre puncture. She 
ignored the driver’s warning to take her car off the road and fix the 
tyre on the hard shoulder area.

'Unfortunately a driver who was passing through that area had warned the
woman to instantly take her car off the road but that she did not 
listen.

'Call it her ignorance, four innocent soul paid with their life 
including a nine-month-old baby boy. Another woman in the car was said 
to be seriously wounded.

'Well, RTA cannot put in extra parameters for women to check their 
presence of mind during crisis situation while driving, it’s all about 
being responsible drivers.'

After scores of angry responses, the Abu Dhabi distributors of Subaru issued a grovelling apology on its site.

It apologised for the post that 'offended the sentiments of a number of people'.

The message read: 'Our sincere apology goes out to everyone for this.

The original post and subsequent apology provoked a furious reaction online

'We respect your sentiments and have taken down the post with immediate effect.

'At Subaru, SAFETY IS OUR TOPMOST PRIORITY AND CONCERN.

'The
news posted yesterday was intended as a general awareness message. 
Sometimes with the best of intentions a final communication may come out
wrong.

'This was one such instance. We just want to bring to everyone’s 
notice to please be more cautious while driving.'

However, many people were equally incensed by the apology, which they called 'inadequate'.

David Porter wrote on the company's Facebook page: 'That's not an 
apology for a sexist rant, it's an apology that the sexist rant caused 
offence. Social media training required. Fail.'

Feda Jarad wrote: 'The original post was immensely incorrect and disgustingly misogynist.'

Pallavi Sharma wrote: 'This will go down in history as one of the most notable social media fails.

'There was a way to get the message across instead it ended up being down right discriminatory.

'As far as the apology goes, a little late but welcome nevertheless.'

Subaru Emirates told Gulf News that it has cancelled its account with the company which handled its social media.
