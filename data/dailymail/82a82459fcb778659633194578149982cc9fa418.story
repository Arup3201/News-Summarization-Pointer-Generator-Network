Brendan Rodgers' decision to field a weakened team for Liverpool's Champions League clash against Real Madrid was not the unmitigated disaster many predicted.

The Reds lost by a smaller margin than their 3-0 home defeat to the reigning champions - but Karim Benzema's match winning strike still leaves Liverpool's European hopes in the balance.

Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman was at the Bernabeu to pick out a few points...

GOING CHEAP

One of the advantages of having an enormous stadium is that you can afford to offer a few tickets at more affordable prices. 

So it was on Tuesday night that Madrid were still selling tickets for about £30 for this game right until kick-off. Mind you, those seeing Liverpool's team sheet may have asked for their money back.

PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS, STEVEN

In his interview with Sportsmail last week, Steven Gerrard talked dismissively of the way Jose Mourinho sent out a weakened team to try and frustrate Liverpool at Anfield towards the end of last season. 

'For me, they just destroyed the game and broke it up,' said the Liverpool captain. It's hard not to wonder what he made of Brendan Rodgers' selection.

NOT SUCH A SAFE PAIR OF HANDS

Interesting that amid all the team changes, goalkeeper Simon Mignolet kept his place. 

One of the more worrying aspects of Liverpool's current problems is the lack of the reliable and genuinely threatening back up goalkeeper. Another issue for Brendan Rodgers to ponder.

IFS BUTS AND MAYBES

During what was admittedly a very one-sided first half, the only occasions that Real Madrid ever looked remotely uncomfortable was when Liverpool ran at them directly. 

Lazar Markovic almost got through on a couple of occasions but all that did was make you wonder what may have happened had the lightening Raheem Sterling been playing.

Most of Liverpool's best moves in the first-half came from the flank patrolled by Lazar Markovic

Had Liverpool decided to start with Raheem Sterling, the outcome may have been different
