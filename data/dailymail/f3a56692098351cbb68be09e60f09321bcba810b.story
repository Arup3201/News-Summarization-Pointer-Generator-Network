How birds rapidly evolved to have feathers, fly and sing is revealed in a major study where the genomes of 45 species of modern birds were sequenced, to generate the most reliable avian tree of life to date.

The international project charts a 'big bang' burst of bird evolution during the 10 to 15 million years after the mass extinction of dinosaurs 66 million years ago,

The period gave rise to nearly all of the 10,000-plus species of birds on Earth today.

The study also suggests that the earliest common ancestor of land birds, which include parrots and songbirds as well as hawks and eagles, was a scaled predator.

The four-year project, which involved researchers from the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute, decoded and compared the genetic fingerprints of 45 bird species, including the woodpecker, owl, penguin, hummingbird and flamingo as well as those of three reptile species and humans. 

The vast study provides fresh insights into how bird genes differ from those of mammals, and the biological mechanisms that gave rise to the vast diversity among birds.

Decoding the genomes enabled the experts to investigate at which point in each species' history specialised characteristics developed, such as feathers, flight and song.

Scientists completed the largest whole genome study of a single class of animals to date by mapping the tree of life for birds. Avian genetic samples from Louisiana State University's Museum of Natural Science, which has one of the largest vertebrate tissue collections in the world (shown), were used for this study

Previous attempts to reconstruct the avian family tree using partial DNA sequencing or anatomical and behavioural traits have met with contradiction and confusion.

This is because modern birds split into species early and in such quick succession, which that they did not evolve enough distinct genetic differences at the genomic level.

To resolve the timing and relationships of modern birds, researchers used something known as whole-genome DNA sequences to infer the bird species tree.

'In the past, people have been using 10 to 20 genes to try to infer the species relationships,' Erich Jarvis of Duke University.

'What we've learned from doing this whole-genome approach is that we can infer a somewhat different phylogeny [family tree] than what has been proposed in the past.

‘We've figured out that protein-coding genes tell the wrong story for inferring the species tree.’

There are two general types of gene in the human genome: non-coding RNA genes and protein-coding genes

Instead of focusing on protein-coded genes, Louisiana State University contributed to the reconstruction of the bird tree by analysing something called loci called ultra-conserved elements, or UCEs.

By aligning these highly conserved parts of the genome and analysing the subtle variations across the different species, the UCE data helped piece together this new tree of life for birds.

Researchers found that the UCE data provided consistent results to infer evolutionary history whereas traditionally, scientists have used data from the protein coding parts of the genome called exons for this purpose.

'It opens up the potential in terms of the types of data people will collect and use in the future when reconstructing the tree of life,' said Brant Faircloth, Curator of Genetic Resources Frederick Sheldon.

Once they inferred a tree from the data, collaborators used the fossil record to date the divergence of each species across millions of years. 

They found that birdsong evolved independently at least twice, for example. 

Parrots and songbirds gained the ability to learn and mimic vocal activity independently of hummingbirds, despite sharing many of the same genes.

This is surprising because animals with similar characteristics usually share a close common ancestor.

The findings are relevant because some of brain processes that are involved in birds singing are also associated with human speech production. 

More than 200 scientists contributed to the Avian Phylogenomics Project, and the findings are published in 23 scientific papers, including eight in the journal Science.

As part of the study, researchers from the University of Kent found that chickens and turkeys experienced fewer large genomic changed than other birds, as they evolved from their dinosaur ancestor.

Professor Darren Griffin explained that the chicken and turkey lineages have undergone the fewest number of changes compared to their ancient avian ancestor thought to be a feathered dinosaur.

One report by Dr Ed Green, of University of California, describes the sequencing of three crocodilian genomes - the American alligator's, the saltwater crocodile's, and the Indian gharial's - which represent birds' closest living relatives.

Dr Green said: 'The molecular evolution of birds is much faster than it is in crocodiles, turtles and other reptilian lineages. So this avian lineage seems to be faster than other reptiles, but not faster than mammals.'

By studying the genes of penguins as part of the huge study, scientists at the China National Genebank in Shenzhen discovered that penguins have a vast number of genes responsible for creating the raw material needed for feathers - proteins known as beta-keratins.

They carry more genes for a particular type of beta keratin than any other bird and it is thought this is what allows them develop their thick plumage of short, stiff feathers that keep them warm. 

The scientists also discovered that penguins have a gene called DSG1, which in humans is known to be involved in a dermatological disease characterised by thick skin on the palms and feet. 

Frozen samples of muscle tissue from bird species (pictured) collected by the Smithsonian Institution were the source of DNA extracted in Duke University labs. The DNA was then sent to BGI in China for full genome sequencing

It's believed these genes may help the penguins develop a uniquely thick skin compared to other birds.

Building on the huge project, scientists at the National Avian Research Facility in Edinburgh have created 48 open access databases to share and expand on the information associated with the birds' genomes.

They hope that researchers from around the world will continue to upload their own data, offering further insights to the genetics of modern birds.

Such information will be useful for helping scientists to understand why infectious diseases, such as bird flu, affect some species but not others.

Professor David Burt, of the National Avian Research Facility, said: 'This is just the beginning.

'We hope that giving people the tools to explore this wealth of bird gene information in one place will stimulate further research.

'Ultimately, we hope the research will bring important insights to help improve the health and welfare of wild and farmed birds.' 

Adélie penguins have eight genes for metabolising fat, which may allow them to adapt quickly to warmer conditions but could leave them struggling in colder weather when food sources are more scarce
