The mother says the renowned TV star asked her to wear her private school uniform and sung a nursery rhyme while they had sex (file picture)

A renowned British actor whose sex life is already protected by a High Court super-injunction has been questioned by police over separate claims that he seduced a girl of 15.

It is alleged that the married star of TV and films asked the girl to put on her private school uniform before a meeting during which he plied her with alcohol.

The victim, now 39, also makes the bizarre claim that the actor recited the nursery rhyme Ride A Cock Horse To Banbury Cross during sex.

She said she had originally been reluctant to report the incident to police but changed her mind last autumn after the Jimmy Savile allegations made her ‘see things differently’.

She said: ‘I’d always felt partly responsible for what happened, but [the Savile inquiry] made me realise that I wasn’t responsible – he was, he was the adult.’

The woman, a civil servant and mother of three who lives in the South West, was told by the Crown Prosecution Service that it was ‘entirely satisfied the sexual assault took place as you described’.

But the actor – who denied the claim when questioned by police and who cannot be named – escaped prosecution for allegedly having sex with an underage girl because the law that applied at the time meant any charge had to be brought within a year of the incident taking place.

In a wholly unrelated legal case in 2011, the hugely popular star took out an injunction to prevent publication of claims about his private life. In the latest allegations, the woman said she had met the actor at a theatre in August 1989, when she was 15.

It was shortly before she started 
boarding school and the actor, now a household name, said her school was
near his home and he would like to take her out. She called him in 
October and he said it would be ‘nice’ if she wore her uniform.

They met in the local town centre and she says he drove her to his home where he gave her wine before they had sex.

‘It happened fairly quickly and I was compliant and just let him get on with it,’ she said.

‘It was clear he knew what he was after. As we had sex he recited the nursery rhyme.’

Women went to police as she said the Jimmy Savile allegations had made her see the incident differently

The woman, who has since been divorced twice, added: ‘At the time I thought it seemed odd but now I just think it was horrible.’

He later dropped her back and said ‘see you soon’, she claimed.

After the police handed their file to the CPS, the woman received a letter explaining that it would be unable to take action. Any charge would have been under the Sexual Offences Act 1956 and proceedings would have had to have started within a year of the incident.

However, if there had been evidence that there was no consent, the actor could have faced a rape charge, prosecutors said.

The woman, who first married at 18 and has attempted suicide twice, said the experience ‘set the tone’ for her expectations of men and of being used by them.

She told the Sunday Mirror: ‘He knew what he was doing and doesn’t care about anybody else.

‘He comes from a lovely background with a good education and he clearly feels entitled to behave like that. But he does not have the right.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
