Working away from home can be lonely, especially if you are 220 miles above Earth on the International Space Station.

But Japanese designers have come up with a way to stop the astronauts from feeling isolated - the world's first talking robot astronaut.

Kirobo - derived from the Japanese words for 'hope' and 'robot' - has been sent into space to keep astronaut Koichi Wakata company.

Mr Wakata will become the space station's first Japanese commander later this year.

Although he will be joined by five flight engineers, including two Russians, two Americans and one Latvian, researchers hope that being able to talk with Kirobo in Japanese will keep his spirits up.

The robot was among five tons of supplies and 
machinery on a cargo rocket headed for the International Space Station which was launched into space from 
an island off Japan today.Â 

Robot designer Tomotaka Takahashi, of the University of Tokyo, advertiser Dentsu and car maker Toyota worked on the robot, which will communicate with another robot on Earth while in space.

He said the challenge was making sure it could move and talk where there was no gravity.

'Russia
was the first to go to outer space, the U.S. was the first to go to the
moon, we want Japan to be the first to send a robot-astronaut to space 
that can communicate with humans,' said Yorichika Nishijima, the Kirobo 
project manager.

Mr Takahashi said he hopes robots like Kirobo that hold conversations will
eventually be used to assist astronauts working in space.

'When people think of robots in outer space, they tend to seek ones that do things physically,' he said.

'But I think there is something that could come from focusing on humanoid robots that focus on communication.'

Because Kirobo does not need to perform physical activities, it is smaller than most robots that go into space. It is about 34cms tall and weighs about 1kg.

Ahead of the launch on Saturday, Kirobo told reporters: 'One small step for me, a giant leap for robots.'

Japan boasts the most sophisticated robotics in the world, but because of its 'manga' culture, it tends to favour cute robots with human-like characteristics with emotional appeal.

Mr Takahashi said sending a robot into space could help write a new chapter in the history of communication.

'I wish for this robot to function as a mediator between person and machine, or person and Internet and sometimes even between people,' he said.

Japan has an ageing population and there is hope that in the future robots like Kirobo could be used as companions for elderly people in their homes and in nursing homes.
