Rory McIlroy could pocket a wallet-busting £975,000 for winning the 143rd Open Championship but it looked like the £20 he pocketed from Darren Clarke on Wednesday morning was worth just as much to him as the top prize itself.

The Northern Irish pair headed out bright and early for a practice round together at Hoylake in the calm before the Open storm. The pair teed off around 6am and whistled round the links before breakfast, playing for their usual bet.

McIlroy was quick to show off who shot the lowest round by celebrating wildly after picking up the crisp note from Clarke, raising his prize in the air like he would the Claret Jug if all goes to plan on Sunday evening.

Cash rich: Rory McIlroy holds aloft the £20 note he claimed off Darren Clarke during their practice round

Sealed with a kiss: The Northern Irishman couldn't hide his delight at winning the wager. Clarke appeared to take the defeat in good spirits

The 25-year-old two-time major champion also posed for pictures with his note, beaming with pride as Clarke was forced to watch.

The bet could bode well for McIlroy’s hopes of winning a maiden Open title at Royal Liverpool this week.

McIlroy
 and Clarke played a practice round together before The Open at Royal St
 Georges in 2011, when the younger Ulsterman was the talk of the golfing
 world after his record-breaking US Open victory at Congressional. 
Clarke, meanwhile was the forgotten man after several years of 
disappointing results.

But
 it was Clarke who took the money in that bet, and he went on to break 
his own major duck with a flawless performance at Sandwich that week.

The
 45-year-old Ryder Cup legend has failed to repeat his heroics that week
 in the three years since, but has dedicated himself to a strict new 
exercise regime in a bid to regain his best form.Clarke has been 
hitting the gym five times a week, lifting heavy weights, doing little 
cardio work, and claims he has lost four stones since last year’s Open 
as a result.

Despite
 Clarke’s new slimline figure, it is McIlroy who will tee it up on 
Thursday as one of the favourites to win the game’s oldest prize.

Tiger
 Woods, who won the Open the last time it was held at Hoylake in 2006 
but is playing in just his second tournament since major back surgery, 
remains the man to beat. Scottish Open champion Justin Rose, world No 1 
Adam Scott and defending champion Phil Mickelson are also ones to watch 
by the Wirral estuary.

But if McIlroy fails to land his big prize, he will always have that £20 note as a memento of his week.

There you go, Rory: Clarke begrudgingly hands over the £20 note to his countryman after losing their bet
