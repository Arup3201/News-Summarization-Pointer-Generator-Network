A former top U.S. Army prosecutor who handled sexual-assault cases has been found guilty on rape charges following a six-day court-martial at Fort Bragg.

The Army issued a five-sentence statement Monday saying Major Erik J. Burris was found guilty on two charges of rape and forcible sodomy, and four charges of assault and disobeying an order.

The Army said Burris was sentenced to 20 years in prison, dismissed from the service, and ordered to forfeit all pay.

Sentenced: Former top Army prosecutor Erik Burris was handed a 20 year jail sentence for two charges of rape and forcible sodomy, and four charges of assault and disobeying an order, an Army statement revealed Monday

As fayobserver.com notes, Burris was the chief of justice for the 82nd Airborne Division and therefor supervised other military prosecutors. 

The statement was the first issued by the Army about the case and provides no details about Burris' crimes.

Burris has consistently maintained his innocence.

However, Burris in March interviewed with his hometown Fox affiliate, Fox 40 in Sacramento, where he revealed more of the scant details in the case.

'She proceeded to make more and more allegations,' the formerly Fort Bragg, North Carolina-based prosecutor said about his victim at the time. 

Dismissed: Burris, a father of two daughters who separated from his wife in 2012 was also dismissed from the service and ordered to forfeit all pay

Denial: Burris sat for a Skype interview with his hometown Fox affiliate in Sacramento in March, where he claimed each time his victim 'spoke to someone new she was accusing me of something else. And generally those accusations became more heinous as the process went on'

'Each time she spoke to someone new she was accusing me of something else. And generally those accusations became more heinous as the process went on.' 

Fort Bragg spokeswoman Major Crystal Boring said Monday that she could not immediately answer questions about Burris' case.

Burris just last summer testified at a trial on behalf of an Army captain accused of sexual assault, fayobserver.com reports.

During those proceedings, Burris claimed that, as the 82nd's chief of justice in 2012 and 2013, he was pressured by the military to pursue sexual assault cases.

The captain for whom he testified was convicted of abusive sexual contact, kidnapping and assault and sentenced to two years incarceration.

As the 82nd Airborne Division's chief of justice, Burris supervised other military prosecutors from his home base of Fort Bragg, North Carolina
