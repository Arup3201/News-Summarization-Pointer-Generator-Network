The grass being used for the athletics field at the Olympic Games comes from Samantha Cameron’s father’s sprawling ‘back garden’.

It has emerged that the turf in the 80,000-seat Olympic Stadium was grown at Sir Reginald Sheffield’s Normanby Hall estate near Scunthorpe.

County Turf, which rents land from the Sheffields, was sub-contracted to supply the grass for the stadium’s infield by the Olympic Delivery Authority.

But the source of its premium sod had remained under wraps until now.

The grass will be graced by hundreds of Olympic stars taking part in field events, including heptathlete Jessica Ennis in javelin, high jump, long jump and shot put. It will also be used for pole vault, triple jump, discus and hammer throwing.

A source said: ‘County Turf often supply grass to stadia and this was no different. They rent land from the Normanby estate, which is close to where they are based.’

The firm, which regularly supplies grass for sports venues such as the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, provided 360 rolls for the 9,000 square metre field.

Sir Reginald, 66, a descendant of King Charles II, will not profit directly from  the deal.

The baronet owns 3,000 acres of prime Lincolnshire farmland as well as a second estate, £5million Sutton Park near York.

He is believed to be worth at least £20million and lists his recreations in Debrett’s Peerage as shooting and stalking.

The Sheffields moved out of Normanby Hall in 1963 when it was handed over to North Lincolnshire Council in lieu of death duties, but Sir Reginald continues to own the surrounding land.

The 300-acre Normanby Hall estate has been in the family since 1590.

After the Sheffield family left the property, they moved to nearby Thealby Hall in the village of Burton upon Stather.

The Prime Minister’s wife and her sister Emily grew up at the Grade II listed hall with their parents, Sir Reginald and Annabel, until they divorced when the girls were children. Sir Reginald continues to live at the hall with his second wife, Victoria.

While the Normanby grass was selected for the athletics field, it is not being used for the opening ceremony’s ‘countryside stage’ at the same venue in the Olympic Park.

Last month ceremony director Danny Boyle unveiled his vision for ‘a green and pleasant land’ for the opening scene, showcasing Britain’s pastoral history. It will include real fields and farmyard animals.

Yesterday, aerial photographs of the stadium showed that the rural set was almost complete. During the ceremony, this will be replaced with a more urban stage, modelled on the opening credits of the TV soap opera EastEnders.

No one at the Normanby estate was available for comment yesterday.
