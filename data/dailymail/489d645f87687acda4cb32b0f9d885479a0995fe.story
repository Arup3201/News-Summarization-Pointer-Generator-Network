The former owner of Anne the elephant was yesterday found guilty of animal cruelty – but walked free from court without even being fined.

Circus boss Bobby Roberts, 70, was given a conditional discharge for keeping Anne constantly chained in her winter quarters and failing to prevent a groom from beating her with a pitchfork.

His wife Moira, 75, was cleared of the same charges after the judge ruled that she was not an owner of Anne and therefore not responsible for her care. The couple ran Bobby Roberts’ Super Circus where Anne’s ordeal was secretly filmed by animal rights group Animal Defenders International.

Last night ADI chief executive Jan 
Creamer said the ‘derisory’ sentence sent out the wrong message to other
animal owners and circuses.

She said: ‘Despite the considerable 
suffering caused to Anne the elephant, the sentencing meted out to Mr 
Roberts is derisory and provides no faith that the Animal Welfare Act 
can protect animals in circuses.

‘People should be held responsible for the day-to-day experiences of their animals.’

Roberts and his wife left Northampton magistrates court without commenting.

Anne was brought over from Sri Lanka 
in the 1950s and worked for the circus for 50 years. She was diagnosed 
with arthritis, for which she was being treated, in 2003.

Sick: The shocking pictures taken from secret footage filmed by Animal Defenders International show Anne being violently beaten around the head, legs and body with a pitchfork and other implements

Shocking: Anne was kicked repeatedly in the footage that was taken inside an elephant shed at Bobby Robert's winter quarters over a three and a half week period

Cruel: A keeper prepares to hit Anne once more with a stick

Suffering: The trial heard Anne rocked backwards and forwards which, as in humans, is a sign of distress

Roberts and his wife, of Oundle, 
Northamptonshire, each denied three charges: Causing Anne unnecessary 
suffering by requiring her to be chained to the ground by one front and 
one back leg, failing to prevent a groom from beating her, and failing 
to meet her needs by ensuring she had enough room to move around in.

The beating was inflicted by groom 
Nicolai Nitu, who is thought to have fled back to his native Romania and
has never been traced.

At the end of the five-day trial 
yesterday, District Judge David Chinery said he was satisfied Anne was 
chained for an ‘excessive’ period and that caused her to suffer. Bobby 
Roberts, who had health problems, entered the barn only four times 
during the three-and-a-half week filming period.

Each time Anne was chained but he 
never asked for her to be untethered – and on one occasion supervised 
the changing over of the chain from one leg to another. The judge said 
Roberts witnessed Anne in chains but ‘for reasons which he cannot 
explain’ did nothing about it.

Usually Anne was unchained between 
11am and 7pm and allowed to wander around in an area of the barn 
cordoned off by an electric fence in accordance with good practice 
guidelines.

The judge said Roberts failed to 
exercise suitable supervision of the groom and it was clear the groom 
was acting under instructions to keep Anne chained.

But he told him: ‘The real cruelty was inflicted by your groom who acted without your knowledge.’

The maximum sentence for each charge 
is a £20,000 fine and six months in jail. A ban on keeping animals could
also have been ordered but was not.

The judge discharged Bobby Roberts on 
condition he does not commit any further offence for three years, and 
said he took into account that Roberts has ‘lost everything’ as a result
of the case and his business is now ‘effectively at an end’.

Anne, aged 60 and Europe’s oldest 
elephant, is now living at Longleat safari park in Wiltshire after the 
Daily Mail intervened to find her a new home.

Thanks to the incredible generosity of
our readers, who donated £340,000, she lives in the old elephant house and has access to a paddock and a pool.  Her keepers sometimes take her for walks around Longleat, when she is feeling up to it.

Saved: Anne, pictured last year enjoying her first Christmas at Longleat, is thriving in her new home

Mail readers raised £400,000 to help Anne live the rest of her life in peace. 

The money was spent giving the elephant a new home at Longleat, where she moved in April last year. 

Funds are also being used to give her a custom-built sanctuary there which will feature a deep water facility, to help her arthritis, and a winter shelter.

The new enclosure should be ready next year and it is hoped it will become a refuge for abused elephants.

Meanwhile, she is still living a life of luxury in a paddock she shares with the rhinos.

When she was first rescued, it was feared her arthritis was so bad she would have to be put down.

But with proper care and attention, her legs improved. 

Longleat chief executive said Anne was 'getting younger by the day'.

Circus: Anne was kept her chained up for 24-hours-a-day and only un-shackled so they could swap which leg she was chained with, a court heard

New life: Anne now lives at Longleat in a giant paddock with its own sandpit for her to play in (pictured)

Fragile: Anne is 58 and video shown to the jury included footage of her being kicked and poked
