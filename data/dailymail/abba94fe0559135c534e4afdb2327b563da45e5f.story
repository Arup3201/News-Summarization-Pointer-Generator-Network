A Texas police officer and his wife have been found shot to death in their Dallas area home in what investigators are calling a murder-suicide.

Sgt Nick Pitofsky, 47, of the Crandall Police Department, allegedly killed his 42-year-old wife, Vanessa, Tuesday morning before turning the gun on himself.

Dallas police responded to the couple's home in the 1800 block of Broward Street at around noon after getting a call asking to perform a welfare check.

Upon entering the two-story duplex, the responding officers discovered the bodies of the man and woman. Both Nick and Vanessa Pitofsky died from gunshot wounds, Dallas Morning News reported. 

According to the Crandall Police Department, Sgt. Pitofsky had worked as a patrol officer for the department for two years. Before joining the suburban force, Pitofsky was a reserve officer with the Dallas Police Department.

NBC DFW reported that the 47-year-old had spent several months in 2007 working as a jailer with the Dallas County Sheriff's Office.

‘Nick was well respected by his peers and will be deeply missed by the city and department as a whole,’ a statement from Crandall PD read. ‘Nick was an energetic and jovial person who got along with everyone.

Chilling words: Five days before the domestic tragedy, Pitofsky appeared in a YouTube video reviewing a Mossberg 500 shotgun, which he said he had purchased for his wife's protection

Expert opinion: Two weeks ago, Pitofsky reviewed a Bersa Thunder 380 pistol after performing a demonstration at a firing range

‘Nick was an extremely dedicated Police Officer for the City of Crandall and its citizens. Sergeant Nick Pitofsky will be deeply missed by his fellow Officers.’

Fox 4 reported on Twitter that a 
friend of Vanessa Pitofsky revealed that the 42-year-old woman had 
recently alerted people close to her that she was getting off Facebook 
because her husband was very jealous.

The couple got married just over three years ago. Mr Pitofsky also had two children from a previous marriage.

‘He was a great guy,’ friend Jonathan Savage told MyFox DFW. ‘I used to go up to Shell all the time and he'd always come in there with a smile on his face.’

Nick Pitofsky was an avid gun and tactical gear enthusiast. The 47-year-old had been a contributor to the Scout Tactical Channel on YouTube featuring video reviews of various weapons.

In a clip posted online just five days before the tragic murder-suicide, Sgt Pitofsky gave a rave review to a Mossberg 500 shotgun.

'I purchased this as a self-defense weapon for my household, essentially for my wife,' he chillingly says in the video.
