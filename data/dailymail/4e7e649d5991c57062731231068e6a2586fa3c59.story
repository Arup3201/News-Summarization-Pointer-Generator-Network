An abandoned newborn was rescued by a homeless man after he discovered her wrapped in a blanket lying in grass, not far from a busy California intersection.

The man, known only as Mark, heard the baby girl's cries and spotted her behind a brick wall on a curb near Lakewood Center Mall, where she is believed to have been born, according to police.

A woman, 35, who said she witnessed the birth was found bleeding and was taken to hospital where doctors concluded she had recently given birth. She is the suspected mother of the baby girl.

Mark was cycling past while looking for recycling items when he found the baby near Hardwick Street and Lakewood Boulevard, according to CBSLA.

After he discovered her, he attempted to carry her to the hospital when he ran into his friend Vance Cobb, who told him to take her to the nearby fire station.

Vance, who is also homeless, said the baby girl was only a few hours old as she still had blood on her.

He said: 'Mark told me that he had found something just wouldn't believe it when I see it, I was like oh my God. It was a baby.'

Items were left behind in the area and blood stains were visible on the curb, grass and part of the street which makes authorities believe the mother gave birth there, according to myFoxLA.

He transported the baby on his bike to the Los Angeles County Fire Department where she was treated and then transferred to Miller's Children Hospital in Long Beach.

While police were at the scene, a 35-year-old woman approached them and said she witnessed the birth and helped the mother cut the umbilical cord. 

During questioning at the station, detectives noticed the woman, who denies being the mother, had blood on her chair when she stood up and was taken to Long Beach Memorial Hospital for treatment.

While at the hospital, doctors examined her and concluded that she recently gave birth, as the placenta and partial umbilical cord remained inside of her.

The suspected mother might also be homeless and living on the streets, according to ABC7. 

A woman, 35, approached police and said she witnessed the birth, but after she was questioned at the station, investigators realized she was bleeding. Doctors at Long Beach Memorial Hospital (above) concluded she recently gave birth. Detectives believe she is the mother

Under California's Safe Haven Law, a newborn can be dropped off at a designated 'safe surrender site', which usually includes hospitals and fire stations, within the first 72 hours without any questions asked during that time frame. 

The investigation into this incident is ongoing as police are possibly considering it as a child endangerment case. 

It will be submitted to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office for review and possible prosecution.

The suspected mother is set to undergo a psychiatric evaluation, and results from a DNA test are pending.
