Publishers met yesterday to sign contracts for the tough new Press watchdog to be launched shortly by the industry.

More than 90 per cent of national newspapers and the vast majority of the regional press, along with major magazine publishers, have signed up to the regulator.

The Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) is now expected to be up and running by May 1 next year.

Paul Vickers, chairman of the industry implementation group, said the response for an ‘independent, tough and effective regulator’ was ‘overwhelmingly positive’.

‘This is an important milestone in the process of setting up the UK’s new self-regulatory system,’ he said.

However, publishers say Ipso will not apply for recognition under the Royal Charter drafted by politicians and approved by the Privy Council last month.

That amounted to state licensing of the Press and would lead to taxpayers’ money being wasted, MPs were told in a debate on regulation at Westminster Hall on Wednesday.

South Dorset MP Richard Drax, who led the debate, said: ‘For all its faults I am proud and fortunate to live in a country with a free and often irreverent Press. Free speech organisations around the world are asking us to rethink. They fear these changes set a dangerous precedent for non-democratic regimes. Our Foreign Secretary William Hague agrees.

‘So why are we going down this road? True democracies erect a barrier between the Government and the Press for lots of good reasons and there is no excuse to dismantle it,’ he said.

‘Those in favour of a Royal Charter say it will not impinge on a free Press. I would disagree.’

Far from being toothless, Mr Drax said Ipso will bring ‘swift and fair redress’ to complainants.

‘Lord Justice Leveson called for a system that all sides could agree to – all sides, please note that word,’ he said. ‘Self-evidently, the Royal Charter fails in this regard and it seems that the Government has seen this for itself.’

Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said the Government is ‘delighted’ with the industry’s progress to establish Ipso.
