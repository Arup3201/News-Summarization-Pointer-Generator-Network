Midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain loves playing in such an attacking Arsenal team - but accepts they will always have to work at keeping it tight at the back.

Arsenal recovered from going behind in the north London derby to a breakaway Tottenham goal for Nacer Chadli as Oxlade-Chamberlain's close-range strike secured a 1-1 draw.

Arsene Wenger's side, however, had enjoyed plenty of possession and should have been ahead before a lapse in concentration from defensive midfielder Matheiu Flamini allowed Christian Eriksen to snatch the ball and set-up a swift counter.

Oxlade-Chamberlain accepts it is a part of Arsenal's game which can hurt them, but is worth it for what the Gunners offer going forwards.

'That is the risk you take when you play the way we play football,' said England international Oxlade-Chamberlain.

'We try to take control of games, we like to set the tempo, We send a lot of bodies forward in a positive and attacking fashion and you do leave yourself at times a little bit vulnerable to the counter-attack.

'It is just important that when we do, we have got people in the team that are willing to take the responsibility of holding back and being there to stop counter-attacks.

'But, yeah, I do love playing in this team and the style of play that we do, as I think all the players could say.

'We do, though, need to obviously be careful and make sure we are defending at the same time as when we are attacking.

'It is something we have always worked on because it is an area I am sure teams look at to try and break us down, so we have got to be ready for that.'

Arsenal head to leaders Chelsea next weekend, where they were thumped 6-0 last season, in what was Wenger's 1,000th match in charge.

Oxlade-Chamberlain, though, insisted that result would not make Arsenal any less cavalier.

'We do understand what happened there last season. Maybe we have got a point to prove there, we know this year we have got to step up in the big games and get some results in them,' he said.

'We are really looking forward to that game and we definitely give Chelsea the respect they deserve, but, at the same time, I have belief in my team-mates and we do in ourselves to be able to go to a place like Chelsea and set the tempo and hopefully take control of the game.

'There will be times in the game I am sure when they have a spell, because they are a top team.

'They are going to have their time, we are going to have ours, we just have to make sure that when we do have our chances we make them count.'

Arsenal were left counting the cost of injuries against Spurs, with captain Mikel Arteta and Aaron Ramsey limping off in the first half, before Jack Wilshere, who suffered a twisted ankle, was replaced for the final 30 minutes.

Wenger was at a loss to explain why soft tissue injuries continue to dog his squad. 'I don't know if we really have to look at it because there is no logic there,' said the Arsenal manager.

'It is two players who were not involved in the (cup) game in the week. We had quite a light week for them and we have to analyse what happened to them. I don't understand.'
