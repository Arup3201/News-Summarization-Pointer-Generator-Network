The Dark Knight massacre gunman James Holmes has claimed his 13th victim after it 
was announced that pregnant survivor Ashley Moser suffered a tragic 
miscarriage.

Ashley Moser was eight weeks pregnant when Holmes burst into an Aurora, 
Colorado cinema theater on July 20th and opened fire killing 12 people 
and injuring 58 others.

Losing her baby while undergoing surgery for her wounds, the sad news 
comes eight days after her six-year-old daughter Veronica Moser was killed 
by 24-year-old Holmes at the Century 16 theater.

The family of 25-year-old Ashley revealed their latest loss in a 
statement on Saturday evening from Aurora Medical Center, where Ashley 
is receiving treatment for injuries to her neck and abdomen.

'Ashley Moser is recovering from an additional surgery she had this morning,' said the statement.

'Tragically, the extreme trauma she sustained also caused a miscarriage.

'We want to send a special thank you to the courageous HEROES of law 
enforcement, other first responders, paramedics, and doctors and nurses 
who have all gone beyond the call-of-duty in caring for our daughter, 
granddaughter and all of the other victims of this tragic event.

'Our sincere appreciation goes out to all of those who have been sending
 well-wishes, prayers and good thoughts to Ashley. Her lifetime of care 
will be a long road.

'For those who wish to donate, please go to any Wells Fargo Bank and 
request the 'Donation Account for Ashley and Veronica Moser'.

The family is still preparing its funeral plans for little Veronica, who was shot to death by Holmes during the midnight screening of the 'Dark Knight Rises'.

It comes as the Century 16 movie theatre offered to pay for the funeral expenses for the victims' families, according to TMZ.

Sources close to a mother of victim Rebecca Wingo told the website that Cinemark, which owns the cinema, called the chapel where her service was held and offered to pay for her funeral.

The owner of the church said the company told him it would provide financial backing to all victims' families by paying any funeral expenses not covered by the Crime Victims' Compensation Fund, TMZ reported.

Rebecca's mother, Shirley Wygal, turned down the offer and said the Victims Advocate Fund covered all expenses.

Holmes is due back in court on Monday
 where he will be formally charged with 12 counts of first-degree 
murder. It is not known if he will face further charges for the death of
 Ashley's unborn child.

Tragically, just days ago, Ashley's boyfriend of two years Jamison Toews shared with CBS News in Denver the ultrasound of their unborn child, who had survived the shootings.

He told them that the scan, which was taken on the day of the shooting showed everything to be fine.

Toews
 spoke of the night that Holmes burst into the theater and opened fire 
ont he unwitting audience members, there to witness the third part of 
the Batman series of films starring Christian Bale.

'Another bullet came and hit her right in the chest, right in front of me and she just feel right back down,' said Toews.

He also described the harrowing moment he saw Veronica had been shot too.

'I saw what you never want to see and it was Veronica’s lifeless body lying there,' said Toews.

Ashley
 Moser, 25, was hit in the abdomen and twice in the throat when 
‘demonic’ James Holmes opened fire during a midnight premiere of the 
film, The Dark Knight Rises, in Colorado.

She was sitting next to her six-year-old daughter, Veronica Moser-Sullivan, who was one of 12 people killed by Holmes.

Ms
 Moser’s brother, Robert Sierra, told the Mail before today's tragic 
news: ‘I don’t know how, but she still has the baby. Yesterday I was 
told she had lost it and today it’s OK. It’s a miracle as she was shot 
in the stomach.’

It has been claimed that the 
breakup of a relationship could have sent Holmes over the edge – the 
first sign yet of a possible motive.

Mr Sierra, 32, described Veronica as 
an ‘angel who was ripped away from us for no reason’. He said: ‘Veronica
 wanted to be a princess, everybody loved her. Her laughter was 
infectious, when she laughed everybody laughed.

‘She was only young but she had ambitions and goals, she wanted to go to college.

‘She would have so much fun playing, all you would hear through the house was her laughing and giggling.’

When Ms Moser was told about Veronica's death, according to relatives, she burst into tears and screamed: 'I want to die.'

'All she's asking about, of course, is her daughter,' said Annie Dalton, who is Ashley Moser's aunt.

'She took it very badly,' Jean Moser, Ashley Moser's grandmother, told the Boston Herald. 'I know she was shocked.

'(Veronica) was a very delightful, lively little girl. She was very engaging. It’s a terrible, terrible tragedy.'

Veronica was to start learning swimming lessons on Tuesday, said Dalton. 'She
 was excited about life as she should be. She's a six-year-old girl. 
This is just a nightmare right now. It's a nightmare. Everything's 
surreal. It's just surreal.'

Mr Sierra added: 'We called her Pumpkin since she was young, because she wore a pumpkin outfit to her first Halloween party  and it just stuck.

‘Veronica loved to dance, she loved to swim. She loved fairies and unicorns and she used to love dressing up and messing around in her mum’s high heels.'

Aurora police chief Dan Oates indicated one motive for Holmes to carry out what Colorado 
governor John Hickenlooper called a ‘diabolical, demonic’ act. Mr Oates 
said: ‘I’ve heard one morsel of information about a relationship that 
may or may not be true.’

Holmes, 24, is being held in the 
Arapahoe County jail on a charge of first-degree murder, where he 
reportedly has shown no remorse and ‘thinks he is in a movie’.

The neuroscience graduate is said to have spent months planning his attack with ‘calculation and deliberation’.

Police say he ordered 6,000 rounds of 
ammunition and bought four guns before donning riot gear and a gas mask 
and opening fire at the Century 16 cinema in Aurora shortly after 
midnight on Friday morning.

The massacre could have been even worse. His A-15 assault rifle jammed, meaning he had to switch to a less powerful weapon.

Asked about Holmes, Mr Sierra was 
barely able to contain his anger. He said: ‘Even if he got the death 
sentence it would not bring Veronica back. We will miss her so much.

‘I have nothing good to say about him.
 They should have shot him on sight. Who would want to keep somebody 
alive who does something like that?’

Investigators are continuing to examine Holmes’s apartment, having disabled the 30 bombs he set up to kill police.

He had hoped to lure officers to his flat by setting a timer to play loud music as he was carrying out his rampage.
