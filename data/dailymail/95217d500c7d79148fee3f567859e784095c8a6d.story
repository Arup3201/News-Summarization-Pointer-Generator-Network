No job or education: Nearly one million young people have no job or education place despite a drop in the number of 'Neets' on last year

Nearly one million young people have no job or education place, despite a drop in the number of ‘Neets’ on last year.

Figures show that 968,000 school-leavers aged 16 to 24 were registered as ‘not in education, employment or training’ at the end of June.

While the figure is down slightly from the same point in 2011, the Coalition admitted the number languishing in what has been called the ‘lost generation’ is too high.

Labour said talent was ‘going to waste’ and highlighted a rise of 100,000 in the number of Neets since the general election in May 2010.

The figure reached a record high in the third quarter of 2011, with 1,163,000 young people aged 16 to 24 out of education or work.

The latest data shows that one in six 16 to 24-year-olds is classed as a Neet, with many living on benefits.

Rising numbers of younger school-leavers – aged 16 to 18 – are falling into the category. A total of 191,000 are registered as Neets, up from 186,000 at the same point last year.

The trends emerged as a report by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said employers had become increasingly reluctant to hire teenagers, particularly in London.

Young people are three times as likely as older workers to have been made redundant last year, it said.

Only 6 per cent of employers – 3 per cent in London – recruit straight from school. For most jobs, school-leavers must compete with more experienced workers.

'Lost generation': The Coalition has admitted the number of school-leavers aged 16 to 24 in the Neet group is too high

The reluctance of firms to hire school-leavers has increased over time, even though young people are generally better qualified in academic terms. The IPPR’s Tess Lanning said: ‘The statistics show that no real progress is being made in reducing the number of young people who are not in education, employment or training. 

‘The question we need to answer is why young people today find it so much harder to find stable and well-paid work than their counterparts in the 1970s, despite the fact that they are far better educated.

‘This is rooted in the lack of high-quality training and work opportunities, particularly for non-graduates. 

‘Young people are far more likely to work in casual, low-paid jobs, and many of the vocational training options available offer low-level training for a specific job.’

Wasted: Shadow education minister Karen Buck, right, said the Government is allowing too much talent go to waste while education secretary Michael Gove's, left, department says they are spending a record £126billion over three years

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We are spending a record £7.5billion on education and training for 16 to 19-year-olds.

‘We are spending £126million over the next three years on extra targeted support for the 55,000 16- and 17-year-olds most in need of education and training.’

But shadow education minister Karen Buck said: ‘The Government is allowing the talents of too many young people to go to waste. Now more than ever, we need to ensure our young people have the right skills, experience and opportunities to progress in education or the workplace.’

More than half of small businesses believe school-leavers lack a basic mastery of the three Rs.

Fifty-nine per cent of firms said literacy skills were poor and 55 per cent questioned numeracy skills in a survey for the Federation of Small Businesses.
