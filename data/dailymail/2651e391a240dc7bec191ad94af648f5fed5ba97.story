Discovery: Traces of pork gelatine have been found in the nasal spray flu vaccine, due to be rolled-out across Glasgow on Wednesday (library image)

Scotland's largest immunisation programme has been delayed after Muslim parents raised concerns that the vaccination contained pork gelatine.

The roll-out of the flu vaccine nasal spray pilot programme was due to begin at 54 schools in Glasgow on Wednesday.

Around 100,000 children from primary schools across Scotland are being offered the nasal spray Fluenz.

But NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said the roll-out had been postponed until Monday after parents at Glendale Primary in Pollokshields on the south side of Glasgow became aware of the issue.

Now, parents will be able to request that their child receives the vaccination by injection rather than through the nasal spray.

A spokesman for the health board said: ‘These concerns relate to the nasal spray vaccine which contains a tiny amount of gelatine of pork origin used during the manufacturing process.’

Dr Syed Ahmed, consultant in public medicine with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said the health board had written to parents to reassure them.

He said: ‘We have highlighted that the World Health Organisation (WHO) offered guidance in 2001 following a meeting of more than 100 Muslim scholars in Kuwait.

'The scholars agreed to issue advice to Muslims that gelatine of pork origin used in vaccines and other medicines is judicially permissible as the gelatine in the final product is a completely changed substance.

‘However we have also confirmed that any parent who remains concerned about the small amount of gelatine in the nasal spray can request that their child can be given an alternative flu vaccination by injection.’

The Scottish Government is gradually expanding the annual flu vaccination programme to include all children aged two to 17 over the next few years.

Change: Parents will now be able to request for their child to receive the vaccination by injection rather than through the nasal spray, the Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board has said

A Scottish Government spokesman said the Immunisation Scotland website provides more information.

She added: ‘Many medicines, including vaccines, used all over the world contain traces of bovine and porcine gelatine.

'Gelatin is an essential ingredient to make the flu nasal spray vaccine effective.

'Many faith groups, including Jewish and Muslim communities, have approved the use of gelatine-containing vaccines.’
