Notorious: 'Cheriegate' conman Peter Foster, 51, has arrived in Fiji on a false passport after going on the run from a three-year jail sentence in Australia (library picture)

Notorious ‘Cheriegate’ conman Peter Foster, on the run from a three-year-jail sentence in Australia, has surfaced in Fiji, after arriving in disguise on a false passport.

In an audacious attempt to remain out of prison after being sentenced for his continuing involvement in the weight loss industry against a court-ordered ban, the 51-year-old former ‘friend’ of Cherie Blair, is now seeking protection in the Pacific island nation.

He has refused to reveal how he managed to escape from Australia, but has admitted travelling in disguise and using a false passport.

‘I’m a stranger again,’ he said. ‘I just feel incredible sadness.’

Foster, who helped Cherie Blair purchase two discounted flats in Bristol in 2002, sparking alarm that she had used a notorious conman, was last week sentenced in his absence to three years imprisonment by a judge in Queensland for breaking an order not to be involved in the slimming industry.

He should have arrived in court to hear the judge deliver his punishment, but instead sent a rambling letter in which he said he had got the date wrong and even hinted that he had contemplated suicide because of the hounding he had received from authorities over the years.

A warrant was issued for his arrest but until he made contact with an Australian newspaper at the weekend his whereabouts were unknown. 

He said he now regards Fiji as his version of Ronnie Biggs’ Brazil - a reference to the Great Train Robber who lived in the South American country for years after escaping British justice.

Foster told Brisbane’s Sunday Mail that his escape to Fiji - where he had once lived and where he had been formerly arrested for allegedly conning a bank out of a large sum of money - had left him exhausted and ‘sick to the stomach’.

He added: ‘There is a sense of exhilaration. But I’ve left a beautiful home and a beautiful family now.

‘I’m a stranger again. It’s hard to celebrate. I know I should be happy, but I’m not. I just feel incredible sadness.’

He revealed that, fearing a jail sentence was looming, he had been planning a possible escape from Australia for six months.

Referring to Justice John Logan, who sat in the Queensland Supreme Court to deliver the three year sentence last week, Foster said: ‘If the judge had given me three months which in itself is severe for a contempt charge, I probably would have served it.

‘There isn’t a lawyer you could ring in Brisbane who wouldn’t say the sentence was savage and wouldn’t stand up on appeal.’ 

He has previously told the court in a letter that he would give himself up once he knew that his ageing, ailing mother, Lou Foster, could be cared for if he was in prison.

Now he has told the Brisbane paper that ‘this is not about avoiding jail.

‘This is bigger than me. It’s about my mother. She will not spend the twilight days of her life in a nursing home. She will spend it being cared for by me and she will spend it with a cool sea breeze in her hair, in the shade of a coconut palm.

‘Her therapy will be floating in a blue lagoon. I just know this place (Fiji) will be my mother’s fountain of youth.’ 

He insisted that he had been maliciously prosecuted because he was Peter Foster.

The self-promoted ‘international man of mystery’ said the steps he had put in place to leave Australia were always an ‘in case of emergency, break glass’ situation.

‘As it was, this judge broke the glass for me when he handed down probably the highest sentence for contempt ever in this country and for one of the most insignificant contempt ever.’ 

He then made a ‘playing with fire’ comment in which he said what the Judge could do with his sentence.

Foster,
who has been imprisoned in Britain, the US and Australia in relation to
his banned involvement in the weight loss industry, knows Fiji well. He
spent many years in the country when he was younger and had rented a 
villa with his mother.

But 
he became heavily involved in Fiji politics and then he was arrested and
charged with money laundering. He literally ran from police but was 
caught when he dived into a river and hit his head on a boat.

Later,
however, he escaped on a yacht and swam ashore in neighbouring Vanuatu,
where he was arrested again and deported to Australia.

He told the Sunday Mail at the weekend that he was now being looked after by friends in Fiji and that he hoped to have an audience this week with acting Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama to talk about receiving permanent asylum.

But whether he is successful remains to be seen - Australia is expected to put enormous pressure on the Fijian authorities to arrest the fugitive and deport him to Brisbane.

His flight from his prison sentence, which has embarrassed police and immigration authorities, is certain to bring an added jail term.

While he has refused to reveal just how he got out of the country, there would be only two ways - by air or sea.

Had he attempted to use a false passport at an airport, it would have been picked up by a sophisticated scanning system - particularly as a watch has been issued for him.

His most likely escape would have been by sea, using a yacht to slip away from a ‘quiet port’ and head direct to Fiji.
