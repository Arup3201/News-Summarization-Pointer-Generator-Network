Simon McNamara was on holiday in Croatia when he died. There were no warning signs that anything was wrong – indeed, he seemed to be in perfect health. But his heart simply stopped beating.

‘He was sitting on the bed, texting, and that was it. It was like switching off a light,’ explains his sister Katherine.

She was told about the harrowing events later by Simon’s two best friends who were with him.

Life and soul: Simon McNamara, who died aged 25 of SADS, with his sister Katherine at a wedding

‘They did all they could,’ she says. 
‘They called for help and a nurse was there within minutes, but there 
was no hope. He had gone.

‘Waiting
at Gatwick Airport for Si’s luggage, but knowing he wouldn’t be coming 
through the doors too, was perhaps the hardest thing I have ever done. I
just felt as if I couldn’t possibly go on.’

After
a post-mortem failed to determine a definite cause, the tragedy in July
2008 was attributed to Sudden Arrhythmic Death Syndrome (SADS), a 
catch-all term for an undiagnosed heart condition.

Shockingly, the syndrome kills 12 Britons aged between 14 and 35 every week.

In
1992, Daniel Yorath, the son of former Wales footballer Terry Yorath 
and the brother of TV presenter Gabby Logan, died from an undiagnosed 
heart condition aged 15 while playing in his garden.

Cameroon footballer Marc-Vivien Foe died on the pitch during an international match in France in 2003, while Motherwell captain Phil O’Donnell also collapsed and died during a game against Dundee United in 2007.

And just three months ago, Chloe Waddell, a teenage swimming star tipped to represent Team GB at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, died at her home in Greater Manchester after going into cardiac arrest.

Like 25-year-old Simon, they were all extremely fit, making their deaths all the more unfathomable. Aside from being an adored son and brother, Simon was also carving out a successful property career, had a flat in Fulham, West London, and planned to marry his girlfriend.

‘Si was extremely intelligent – he got straight As at school and achieved a top 2:1 in his economics degree from Durham University,’ says Katherine, a financial manager from Nottingham. ‘He was the life and soul of the party, stupidly good-looking and incredibly caring.’

In the months after Simon’s death, the McNamara family’s collective grief manifested itself in various ways. ‘I thought I felt my heart break – a sharp, physical pain I’d never experienced before,’ Katherine says. ‘How could I go on without my gorgeous little brother?

‘Previously, whenever anything had gone wrong in my life, I would turn to my parents, but they were suffering too. We were united, yet I felt incredibly alone. As a sibling, there was a very particular sense of desperation and loneliness.’

Help was at hand from Cardiac Risk in 
the Young (CRY), a charity set up in 1995 to help prevent SADS through 
better screening. The charity’s teams visit schools and sports clubs 
across the country, offering simple heart-monitoring scans that can flag
up abnormalities.

It also 
provides support for families in mourning thanks to volunteers who train
to become accredited counsellors. Most recently, CRY launched a new 
service aimed at helping siblings of SADS victims.

‘When
someone loses a brother or sister, there’s a very real risk of 
implosion because they’re not prepared to make themselves – or their 
pain – heard,’ says CRY founder Alison Cox.

Professor
Richard Schilling, consultant cardiologist at BMI The London 
Independent Hospital, believes the best way to prevent SADS is to offer 
screening using an echocardiogram (ECG), a painless test that detects 
electrical or rhythm problems with the heartbeat.

‘There
may be no warning signs at all,’ he says. ‘But an unexplained collapse 
or blackout, a family history of sudden death in the young, or sustained
palpitations – more than a few seconds of feeling your heart race – 
could be an indicator.’

Dr Ffion Davies, a consultant in emergency medicine at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, has been campaigning for better awareness of SADS for a decade. ‘Most cases have a genetic origin,’ she explains. ‘Cases tend to come to light in teenagers and those in their early 20s, as the heart grows and matures. Frequently we hear about SADS happening during sport when the heart beats faster and harder, and may also suffer slightly low oxygen levels.

‘If a person already has an abnormal heart structure or a genetic problem with the electrical conduction, exercise may trigger the heart to go into an abnormal rhythm and, in the worst case, a cardiac arrest.’

Katherine, who is now a long-term CRY volunteer, devotes much of her time to spreading this message in a bid to save other families from the same anguish she still experiences.

‘The hardest time for me is January because Si’s birthday was the day after mine. These days, I prefer to lie low and instead of gifts, I ask everyone to donate to CRY. That’s the best possible present because it’s for him too.’
