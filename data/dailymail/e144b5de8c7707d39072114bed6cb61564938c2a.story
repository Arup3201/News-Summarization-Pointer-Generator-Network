President Warren G. Harding had a nickname for his private parts - one he used quite often. He called them Jerry.

It's just one of the tawdry and embarrassing revelations from a trove of steamy love letters that Harding wrote to his mistress Carrie Fulton Phillips during their 15-year affair.

Today, the letters were finally made public by the Library of Congress after being kept under seal for 50 years at the request of Harding's surviving relatives.

In the age of disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal and the salacious details about President Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky, Harding's letters feel almost comical.

Harding was president from 1921 until his death in office in 1923, a short, unremarkable tenure. He broke off his relationship with Phillips before he was elected to the White House - but maintained it while he was Lieutenant Governor of Ohio and a U.S. Senator.

Affair: Warren G. Harding (left) carried on a 15-year affair with Carrie Phillips (right) before he was president. He wrote 900 pages of adoring, and sometime bawdy, love letters to her. She kept all of them, despite his request that she burn them

August 20, 1918: Harding tells his mistress - 'Wish I could take you to Mnt. Jerry. Wonderful spot. Not in the geographies but a heavenly place, and I have seen some passing views there and reveled in them. Gee! How I wish you might be along. You could be such a dandy companion - it would be adorable to have you. I am sure I would be sweetly content - you could make me so.'

The letter above was written on letterhead from the Pavilion Hotel in Montpelier, Vermont. Some of his letters were even written on U.S. Senate stationary and letterhead

But it's clear - in the hundreds of pages of correspondence that Mrs Phillips kept - that Harding was wild about her.

The New York Times Magazine offered several excerpts from the letters earlier this month, taken from  the book The Harding Affair: Love and Espionage During the Great War.

'I love your poise/ Of perfect thighs/ When they hold me in paradise,' Harding wrote in a poem to her in January 1912.

He wrote in September 1913: 'Honestly, I hurt with the insatiate longing, until I feel that there will never be any relief until I take a long, deep, wild draught on your lips and then bury my face on your pillowing breasts.

'Oh, Carrie! I want the solace you only can give. It is awful to hunger so and be so wholly denied.' 

Warren G. Harding was married to Florence Harding, who managed his business affairs and was a well-liked and adept political wife who helped his career

January 28, 1912: Harding wrote a lengthy poem to his mistress in which he alluded to the fact that they had made love at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve in Montreal. He wrote: 'I love your poise/ Of perfect thighs When they hold me in paradise. I love the rose/ Your garden grows/ Love seashell pink/ That over it glows. I love to suck Your breath away I love to cling /There long to stay.'

The 900 pages of letters contain countless details about Warren G. Harding's affair with Carrie Phillips, but a pattern develops. He refers to his private parts - and sometimes himself - as Jerry, part of a strange code. He also references several times the moment they had sex at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve 1911 in Montreal. Here are a few of the zingers - culled from New York Times Magazine:

Harding also tended to get a bit bawdy in his letters, telling her: 'Wish I could take you to Mount Jerry. Wonderful spot' - an obvious reference to his private parts.

Harding asked his mistress to destroy the letters after reading them, but like any good political mistress, she kept them as evidence of her relationship with Harding.

Harding was married to Florence Harding, who proved to be an adept business manager and stateswoman in her own right. Mr Phillips was married to one of Harding's friends, businessman James Phillips.

Historians say that neither marriage was happy. Mrs Harding suffered from kidney inflammation that was never properly treated. Mrs Phillips spent much of her time away from her husband in Ohio - living in Berlin and other parts of Europe.

Mrs Phillips has also been accused by one modern historian of being a German spy, though other researchers are skeptical and her relatives fiercely deny the allegations.

Some of the letters were published in the 2009 book the Harding Affair, however, the trove that was released on Tuesday have remained under seal since July 29, 1964. Harding's grand nephew fought to keep them secret for 50 years after the ruling.

However, Harding's remaining relatives aren't entirely happy that the former president's dirty laundry is on show for everyone to see.

'There are times when I wish he had sealed them for 75 years,' Richard Harding, the former president's great-nephew told the Columbus Dispatch.
