New data may link frequent trips to the dentist with preventing you from losing your teeth in old age.Â 

Mississippi residents are least likely to say they've been to the dentist in the past year, a new poll says - and that might be tied to the state's high rate of entirely toothless senior citizens.

Conducted by Gallup, the poll found that only 53% of Mississippi residents said they'd been to the dentist last year.

The bottom ten states in the survey included were Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri and Arizona.

178,072 adults were polled in a random sampling in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.

Further north, the poll found that 74.9 percent of Connecticut residents said they'd been to the dentist last year. Gallup says it's the third year in a row that Connecticut has taken this position.

Massachusetts and Rhode Island rounded out the top three, with 74.5% and 73.8% of respondents saying they had gone to the dentist, as well.

Other states in the top ten include Alaska, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, Utah, Delaware and South Dakota.

As pointed out by The Washington Post, this data could be correlated to a 2012 Bloomberg chart that ranks states' dental health scores - and notes the percentage of seniors in each state with no natural teeth left.

Best and worst: Connecticut did the best in the poll, while Mississippi did the worst. A different 2012 chart said that 27% of Mississippi seniors had no natural teeth

According to that data, Mississippi has the lowest dental health score in the country - and 27% of its senior citizens are toothless.

The other two worst states for dental health are Louisiana and West Virginia - where 25.6% and 36% of seniors lack chompers, respectively.

Unsurprisingly, Connecticut had the best health score in that chart, with a mere 9.2% of its senior population without teeth. Hawaii, however, had an even lower percentage, with just 7.4%.
