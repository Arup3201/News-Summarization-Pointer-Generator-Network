Robbed: Thomas Van Straubenzee, a friend of Prince Harry, had two mobile phones taken from him when he was mugged in Battersea, South London

A friend of Prince Harry feared for his life after being ambushed by two muggers who claimed they had a knife, a court heard yesterday.

Thomas van Straubenzee, one of the prince’s oldest friends, was grabbed by the throat and rugby tackled as he chatted on his mobile.

One of the hooded men knelt on the 29-year-old’s throat and placed a hand over his mouth, stifling his screams, it was alleged.

Kingston Crown Court heard the pair then rifled through his  pockets before making off with his wallet, £90 in cash and two phones.

Mr van Straubenzee, who met Harry at Ludgrove Prep School before attending Eton with him, was not in court yesterday to see his alleged attacker, Winful Taylor.

Mr van Straubenzee was left dazed, with grazes to his neck and hands.

Two days later, police tracked down Taylor, 27, at a hostel where he was living in Streatham, South London.

The court heard that after his arrest, officers found two phones, including Mr van Straubenzee’s Nokia.

Taylor, 27, of Stockwell, south London, denies robbing Mr van Straubenzee of two mobile phones, his wallet and its contents on November 30 last year.

He claimed he had bought the phone from 
‘a friend’. However, it is claimed his SIM card was used in the Nokia an
hour and 20 minutes after the mugging.

Daniel Robinson, prosecuting, told the jury: 'The prosecution case is that Mr Taylor, together with another man whose identity we don’t know, committed a robbery.

'We say that the two of them robbed Mr Van Straubenzee of his mobile phones, two of them, and his wallet containing bank cards and some cash.'

Mr Robinson said Mr Van Straubenzee, 29, was robbed just after 7.15pm in Albert Bridge Road, on the west side of Battersea Park, near to the River Thames.

'He was on one of his mobile phones to a friend of his, and a man approached him and grabbed him by the throat.

'A second man almost immediately ran at him and knocked him over, in something like a rugby tackle.

'One of the robbers sat on the lower half of his body, the other robber put his knee on his neck, and his mouth was covered by one of their hands.

'One of them started to go through his pockets, and the robbers told him that they had a knife.

'They took his phone off him, and Mr Van Straubenzee handed over the rest of his property, because he thought he was going to be stabbed.

'They took his two mobile phones - one a Nokia, one a BlackBerry - and his wallet with its contents.

'A passer-by came to his assistance and police were called at 7.18pm.'

Mr Van Straubenzee was able to give police the IMEI number of his red Nokia phone, Mr Robinson said. That code identifies the handset and allows it to be tracked through the mobile network.

Police arrested Taylor two days after the robbery at a hostel where he was living in Streatham, south London.

He had two mobile phones with him in a bag. One was a Samsung and one was Mr Van Straubenzee's red Nokia, Mr Robinson said.

Taylor denied responsibility for the robbery, and said he bought the Nokia for £20 the previous day from a friend.

'He said he had not used the phone to make any calls, but that was a lie,' Mr Robinson said.

Police found that the SIM card from 
the Samsung phone had been used in the Nokia as soon as 80 minutes after
the robbery, he added.

'The
prosecution say he was caught out in clear lies about the circumstances
in which he came to be in possession of the phone,' the prosecutor 
added.

'He was one of the robbers, and that's why he lied about it.'

When he was arrested, Taylor told police he had been 'set up' and knew nothing about the robbery.

In a police interview, he said: 'I don't know nothing about it.'

He added: 'I think I was set up. I bought the phone a couple of hours and then I got arrested a couple of hours after that.'

He asked officers: 'I want to know how you linked me to this robbery'. But they refused to tell him.

In a statement which Mr Robinson read 
to the jury, Mr Van Straubenzee said he finished work in Chelsea that 
day and started to walk home.

'I was on the phone to a friend of mine and was not paying attention to anybody around me,' he said.

One man approached him 'from nowhere', grabbing him by the throat with one hand and the arm holding the phone with the other.

'A second man barged into me, which made me fall to the ground on my back.'

He started to shout for help, but they told him they had a knife and to stop shouting.

'I was in fear of being stabbed,' he said.

Items he handed over included £90 cash and a red leather diary.

A statement was read out from Simon Hempsall, a surveyor, who said that as he was walking in the area he heard 'a muffled scream'.

'I could tell someone was really scared,' he said.

He then saw two men running away.

'I crossed the road and saw a male who was what I would describe as dazed and confused. He informed me he had just been mugged and his phone had been stolen.'

On trial: Kingston Crown Court, where Winful Taylor stands accused of robbing Mr van Straubenzee in September last year

Mr Hempsall let Mr Van Straubenzee use his phone to tell police what had happened.

Stuart Vear, a builder, also made a statement saying how he had seen the robbery outside his flat. 'I heard a shriek outside, it was loud and sounded like a person crying for help.'

He looked outside and saw a struggle taking place against a fence.

'Two men then went up the road away from a third male. I quickly lost sight of them because they were running very fast.'

Mr Vear and his wife shouted to the man, who said he had just been mugged, then they saw another man cross the road to help him call the police.

'The whole struggle lasted only seconds, including the two men running off,' Mr Vear said.

Mr Van Straubenzee, who is also close friends with the Duke of Cambridge, first met Harry at Ludgrove Prep School.

The royal brothers are patrons of a memorial fund dedicated to Mr Van Straubenzee's brother, Henry, who was killed in a car crash in 2002.

The second alleged mugger has never been traced. The trial continues.
