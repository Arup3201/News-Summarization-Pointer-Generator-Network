Maxine Carr, now 37, served 21 months in jail for providing child killer Ian Huntley with a false alibi

Maxine Carr has married her ‘besotted’ boyfriend in a private wedding attended by both their families.

The 37-year-old reportedly wore a £2,000 ivory dress for her big day at a hotel during which guests enjoyed a three-course banquet and sparkling wine.

Carr, who served 21 months in jail for providing killer Ian Huntley with a false alibi after he murdered Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, both ten, in 2002, was given away at the ceremony by her 71-year-old mother.

Her husband is said to be ‘absolutely besotted’ with the former teaching assistant despite being aware of her past.

It is understood his family were surprised by his decision to marry the former prisoner but offered their support by still attending the wedding.

The newlyweds are said to have smiled and joked with guests as they posed for photographs on the hotel's patio after exchanging vows in front of a registrar.

But news of the recent wedding has angered some individuals who believe it is unjust Carr is continuing her life as normal. 

One source told The Sun: ‘The families of Holly and Jessica will never get to see their daughters marry.

‘They will never get to enjoy their big day. Why should she?’

Carr was originally jailed for three-and-a-half years for perverting the course of justice by covering for Huntley but only served half of her sentence. She was given anonymity for life on her release in 2004.

It means details of her wedding, new partner or the venue they married at cannot be published because it could lead to her identification.

She is just one of four former UK prisoners to be given secret identities, along with child killer Mary Bell and James Bulger’s murderers Robert Thompson and Jon Venables. Police protection and a new identity for Carr are thought to have cost the taxpayer millions.

Huntley, now 40, was found guilty of murdering the girls following a six-week trial at the Old Bailey, and is now serving a double life sentence in prison

Carr was the girlfriend of school caretaker Huntley when he was arrested soon after the bodies of schoolgirls Holly and Jessica were found in August 2002. They had been missing from their homes in Soham, Cambridgeshire, for 13 days.

Huntley eventually admitted that the girls had died in his house after he had invited them in, but said their deaths were accidental.

He had told them that Carr was in the house, but she had actually gone to Grimsby to visit relatives.

Although Carr was not implicated in the murder, she gave Huntley a false alibi, claiming that she had been with him at the time of the killings, which delayed the police investigation. 

In fact she was at a nightclub in Grimsby with another man.

Huntley, now 40, was found guilty of murdering the girls following a seven-week trial at the Old Bailey, and is now serving a double life sentence in prison.
