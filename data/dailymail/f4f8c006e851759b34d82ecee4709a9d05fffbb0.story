The under-25s will be stripped of their benefits to ensure they either ‘earn or learn’, David Cameron announced yesterday.

Unveiling a new crackdown on welfare, the Prime Minister said young people will no longer be able to ‘opt for a life on benefits’.

The plans will mean that school leavers either have to take a job or an apprenticeship or remain in education or training.

Those who refuse will face sanctions, including the loss of out-of-work benefits.

Tough: David Cameron said all school leavers should be earning or learning, not able to opt for a life on the dole

At the moment, those who refuse to take a job or an offer of a training place can lose their job seeker’s allowance (JSA), but the Tories plan to toughen that policy by also slashing or removing housing benefit payments if the under-25s refuse to co-operate.

Mr Cameron told the Tory conference that the move was necessary because one million young people were not in education, employment or training.

He said: ‘Today it is still possible to 
leave school, sign on, find a flat, start claiming housing benefit and 
opt for a life on benefits. It’s time for bold action here.

‘We 
should ask, as we write our next manifesto, if that option should really
 exist at all. Instead, we should give young people a clear, positive 
choice: Go to school. Go to college. Do an apprenticeship. Get a job.’

Mr
 Cameron said the Government should not allow young people to ‘just 
choose the dole.

'We’ve got to offer them something better than that.’

Address: The Conservative leader told delegates that further reforms to the welfare state, schools and the economy were needed

He added: ‘This is what we want to see: everyone under 25 earning or learning.’

The
 savings could be considerable. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says 
there are 410,000 under-25s claiming JSA at a cost of £1.2billion a 
year, while 380,000 young people are on housing benefit at a cost of 
£1.8billion.

The cuts are likely to be controversial since 169,000 of
 the young housing benefit recipients are single mothers and another 
32,000 are couples with children.

The Prime Minister and Work and 
Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith were originally planning to strip 
housing benefit from the under-25s altogether – a suggestion floated by 
Mr Cameron in his conference speech last year. But that plan foundered 
because it was opposed by the Liberal Democrats.

Mr Cameron and 
Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg have asked Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy
 Heywood to draw up a report into training and education for the 
under-25s.

Under existing rules, young jobless people lose their 
benefits if they train for more than 16 hours a week.

Serious: Mr Cameron's speech was widely seen as an echo of John Major's pitch to voters in 1992, that the job of repairing Britain is not yet complete

As a result, the 
system pays them if they are not in training – but stops supporting them
 when they do.

The Heywood review is looking at ways to support young people after they have started training programmes. Sir Jeremy will report back in the autumn.

The Tories aim to persuade the Lib Dems to back the new sanctions regime. If they refuse, the Conservatives will ‘definitely’ put the measure in their election manifesto in 2015, sources said.

Last night a senior Lib Dem source said Mr Clegg would wait until he has read Sir Jeremy’s report, but voiced concern that the scheme would work only if there were enough jobs or training places to offer people.

‘You need carrot as well as stick,’ the source said. ‘There are one million young people out of work and there are not enough jobs for them to go into.’

Not there yet: David Cameron warned delegates at the Tory party conference in Manchester that there was a 'long way' to go before Britain was out of the woods

Mr Cameron conceded that the cuts will be seized on by opponents as ‘callous’, but added: ‘With your children, would you dream of just leaving them to their own devices, not getting a job, not training, nothing?

No – you’d nag and push and guide and do anything to get them on their way . . . and so must we.’

He accused Labour of being ‘intensely relaxed about people  staying stuck on welfare year after year’, and added: ‘We don’t patronise people, put a benefit cheque in their hand and pat them on the head. We look people in the eye as equals and say: “yes, you’ve been down – but you’re not out, you can do it, you have it in you, we will give you that chance”.’

A Labour source said: ‘This is an empty and a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that there was absolutely nothing in David Cameron’s speech to deal with the cost-of-living crisis facing families.’

Stephen Twigg, backed a free school in Liverpool, Cameron said

David Cameron accused Labour of double standards on free schools by highlighting the ‘unbelievable’ record of shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg.

The Prime Minister said Mr Twigg, MP for Liverpool West Derby, opposed free schools nationally but had backed one in Liverpool.

It comes after the Daily Mail revealed last week that at least 21 Labour MPs – including four  members of the shadow cabinet – are supporting local free schools.

Mr Cameron told the Tory conference: ‘You want to know something totally extraordinary about free schools?

'Labour’s official policy is to be against them but – get this – Labour MPs are backing them in their local area. And not just any Labour MPs.

‘I promise I’m not making this up: the shadow education secretary, Stephen Twigg, has backed one in his own city. Unbelievable.’

The Prime Minister added: ‘Isn’t that always the way with the Left? They don’t like privilege – unless, of course, it’s for their own children.’

Mr Twigg has praised the Everton Free School in Liverpool as ‘inspiring’, and shadow health secretary Andy Burnham attended the ‘founders’ ceremony’ for the Atherton Community free school in his Leigh constituency.
