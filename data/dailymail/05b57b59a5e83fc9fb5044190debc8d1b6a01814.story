The average British person has just one ten-thousandth of the net worth of David Beckham, a study revealed today.

Using a formula common in probate cases, legal experts calculated the value of the average Briton's property equity, savings, pensions, investments, cars and possessions.

They came up with a figure of just £147,134 - less than the asking price currently advertised for a parking space in London's sought-after Portman Square.

Ten thousand times richer than you: David Beckham and his wife Victoria. The former England and Manchester United ace has a net worth of £165million - compared to the average Briton's net worth of £147,134

It's less than 0.01 per cent the value of former Manchester United and England football icon Beckham's estimated fortune, which was calculated last year to be £165million. 

And it is just over a millionth of the net worth of the UK's richest resident, Russian mining mogul Alisher Usmanov, who has a net worth of £13.3billion according to the Sunday Times Rich List.

The calculations include the average person's current pension pot estimated in the region of £30,000, with mortgage equity accounting for an average of £75,000.

The study of the assets of 2,000 adults found that 46 per cent had 'no idea', while 11 per cent don't know what the term even means.

It found that 42 per cent of adults don't think they are worth very much in monetary terms, and yet have a mortgage equity of at least £75,060.45.

In addition, a further £5,603.98 is 
stowed away in a savings account, on average, and another £3,712.65 
building interest in an ISA.

The
 average British adult has around £1,348.16 in their current bank 
account at any one time and puts money into a pension which is estimated
 to currently stand in the region of £30,000.

Finally,
 people can take their belongings into account by including the value of
 the car they own and the items in their home - which are worth an 
average of £6,706.55 and £15,077.90 respectively.

Worth a million times more than you: Russian mining mogul Alisher Usmanov is Britain's richest resident, according to the Sunday Times Rich List 2013

That's a grand total net worth of just over £147,000. That's a lot of money for most Britons, and might even be enough for Beckham to think hard about. but it's mere pocket change for the country's richest residents.

After Mr Usmanov, the next wealthiest men who choose to live in Britain are Ukrainian-born U.S. businessman Len Blavatnik - worth an estimated 10billion - and the Indian brothers Sri and Gopi Hinduja - jointly worth £10.6billion.

Gillian Coverley, a wills, trusts and estates expert at solicitors Irwin Mitchell, which carried out the study, said: 'Many British adults feel they have very few assets to their name and consequently is it not worth them making a will.

'But the reality is very different, in that most people will have assets tied up in investments they wouldn't even think would count.

'So while the average British adult doesn't have millions tucked away like David Beckham they should still make sensible provisions and arrangements for their future.'

Despite the facts and figures demonstrating the value of the average adult, six in 10 still don't have any sort of will in place, while a third have no plans to make a will because they don't ever think they'll need one.

Having no assets, having nothing to leave anyone and being in debt for the rest of their lives are some of the most common reasons why well over 16 million adults have no intention of getting the appropriate paperwork in place in the event of their death.

In addition, 47 per cent of people don't know how assets are distributed after death, while 54 per cent are clueless about what accounts and investments their partner or family has.

Ms Coverley added: 'Planning for the future is vital. Many people are attempting to save money by not making wills and then when the inevitable happens, they do it themselves in relation to the estate administration.

'What they find is that this is a specialist area of law and there are potentially serious pitfalls.

'While some may feel they can save money by avoiding legal advice, our experience is that such an outlook can create a false economy.

'This is because ultimately, if they do go it alone and subsequently hit problems, then it can be more expensive to sort out the situation in the long run.

'Common issues from failing to take advice include incorrectly distributing the estate and a lack of awareness of the tax issues which surround administering an estate - this can lead to missed tax deadlines and potential penalty charges.

'Also, with specialist advice, they may be able to look at ways to reduce the burden of inheritance tax to the benefit of families and charities.

'Finally, without the relevant experience, people may often be unable to properly and thoroughly assess all of the assets and debts of the deceased - an issue in itself which makes it more likely that distribution of the estate will not be undertaken correctly.

'The consequences of getting such issues wrong can be serious and Personal Representatives are personally and financially liable for any mistakes they make.'
