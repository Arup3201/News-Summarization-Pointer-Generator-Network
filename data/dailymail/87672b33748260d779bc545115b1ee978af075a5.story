Two festival goers were arrested at the annual Utah Festival of Colors in Spanish Folk, an event that is largely peaceful and strictly drug and alcohol free, for charges of drug dealing, disorderly conduct and criminal mischief.

Cory Sutterfield, 18, of Sandy was arrested after allegedly throwing colored chalk at a Utah County sheriff's deputy who was managing traffic at the festival in Spanish Fork.

Tanner McBride, also 18, of Herriman, was arrested for possession of marijuana, possession of prescription drugs and intent to sell drugs, as well as being caught with six teens under 18 in his car when an officer pulled him over for speeding.

Sutterfield was eventually caught not only because of disorderly conduct, but also because the police had a warrant out for his arrest.

McBride had been caught with various drug paraphernalia, such as a marijuana grinder, a 'baggies containing a green leafy substance', prescription drugs and cash, according to a police report.

The report from the arresting officer said: 'He told me that he had been selling marijuana at the festival.'

McBride also faces charges of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, due to his involvement with under 18s.

The festival, which took place in Spanish Fork, was attended by nearly 70,000 people, and is set up to commemorate Holi, an ancient Hindu celebration.

Each year the participants celebrate the festival by throwing dyed corn starch and coloured chalk to signify the arrival of spring.

In the Hindu religion, spring is a time for forgiveness and renewal.

Priest of the Sri Sri Radha Krishna Temple in Spanish Fork, Caru Das, said: 'There's all that youthful energy that sometimes, in terms of religion, 
we don't really offer an outlet to in a pure, constructive, 
consciousness-raising way, to have a really great time.'

The two teenagers were arrested at the event for drug offences and mischievous behavior at a festival which is supposed to be drug and alcohol free

Nearly 70,000 people attended the festival of colors, many of them being members of the Mormon community, as well as students from local universities

A large percentage of the people attending the festival were celebrating it peacefully, and a great deal of them were part of the young Latter-day Saint community.

'The young Latter-day Saint people resonate with it because they can 
celebrate their spirituality in an atmosphere that's totally drug- and 
alcohol-free, not totally, but that's our intent, and those arrests were
 made because of our zero-tolerance policy for those things.'

No one is permitted to throw colored starch inside the temple because it is considered sacred.

Mr Das says Brigham Young University and Utah Valley University students go to the temple for their world religion and anthropology classes, and the temple also holds twice-weekly services and community events.

The revelers use combinations of colored corn starch and colored chalk in the Hindu festival, which is celebrated around the world

The only things bringing down the event were the arrests, and the prospect of a massive clean up effort that would came after the event had finished

Despite the arrests, he called the festival a spiritual, and financial, success, and said that funds raised during the festival sustain the religious community and help the members take the festival to other cities.

He said: 'When you throw the colors to the wind, you are throwing up your 
resentments and you're looking toward a future that's so great, you need
 sunglasses to face it.'

After the festival came the massive clean up effort, where most of the participants were 'very helpful'.
