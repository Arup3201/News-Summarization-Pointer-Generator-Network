This is the moment a black man was stopped by police for walking with his hands in his pockets.

In a cell phone video, the officer can be seen telling Brandon McKenzie he received a 911 call saying his actions were 'making people nervous'.

Blasting the action as 'outrageous', McKenzie questioned why he was singled out over any other person walking through Pontiac, Michigan, in the snow on Thanksgiving.

Pulled over: Brandon McKenzie (right) filmed an officer stopping him for walking with his hands in his pockets

He recorded the exchange on his phone as he said: 'Wow, walking by, having your hands in your pockets makes people nervous to call the police, when it's snowing outside?

'There's 10,000 people in Pontiac right now with their hands in their pockets.'

The officer said it was his duty to inspect 'unusual conduct', adding 'we do have a lot of robberies, so just checking on you.'

'We have a lot of robberies': The cop started filming McKenzie as he said his actions were 'unusual'

Outraged: McKenzie posted the video of the incident in snowy Pontiac, Michigan, on his Facebook page

As the shocked man films the incident in disbelief, the officer says: 'Am I inconveniencing you?'

Before eventually being told he is free to go, the man makes reference to the bitter protests over alleged police racism that are sweeping the country in the wake of Michael Brown's shooting.

He retorts: 'Because of the whole police situation going on across the country this is outrageous.'
