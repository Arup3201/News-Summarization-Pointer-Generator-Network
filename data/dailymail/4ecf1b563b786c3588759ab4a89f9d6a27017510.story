A cyclist has spelt out his love for his girlfriend - by using a GPS app to map a romantic marriage proposal.

Rider Murphy Mack traced out the words 'Marry me Emily' surrounded by a heart, using the free software Strava, favoured by cyclists to record routes, speed and elevation.

His romantic gesture on the streets of
 San Francisco which took in 18 miles and burned 749 calories in 80 
minutes was enough win over his girlfriend Emily McLanahan.

Romance: Cyclist Murphy Mack rode 18 miles around the streets of San Francisco to spell out his love for girlfriend Emily

Joy: Girlfriend Emily McLanahan  said 'YES! I love you!' under Murphy Mack's carefully constructed marriage proposal

She wrote under the map 'YES! I love you!' and in reply Murphy responded: ''YAY!! XOXO!'

Strava
 allows people to use a smartphone or Garmin to track their athletic 
activity and then view the route they have taken on a map.

It has spawned a new craze, as cyclists and runners create their own artwork with the red route line.

However other jokers have used Strava for less romantic with one wag from Brighton using the device to draw a man's private parts.

Craze: Users of fitness trackers, such as Strava, have begun using a GPS device to create pictures while mapping their activities

Fanatic: A baseball fan mapped out the logo for the San Francisco Giants during a 22.7mile ride around the city

The Strava user going by the name 'Aston' proudly uploaded his juvenile creation - which mapped a 4.6mile route over a 25 minute period - under the heading: 'One Day I Will Grow Up'.

The immature stunt attracted appreciative replies, including 'Genius!' and 'Top banana!!!! I wish I'd thought of this.'

Other examples of Strava art include a giant cat and the logo of the San Francisco 49ers American football team.

Another cyclist, Bret Lobree, spent four hours drawing a huge turkey around a 53mile route in California for Thanksgiving last November.

Work of art: One Strava user created this turkey during a ride around San Francisco

Dedication: Another Strava user showed support for professional cyclist Peter Saga by tracing his name out on the streets of San Francisco
