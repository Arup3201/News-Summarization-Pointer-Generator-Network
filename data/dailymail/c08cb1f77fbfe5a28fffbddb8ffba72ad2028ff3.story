It is the kind of order you might expect in the blazing sunshine of summer.

But householders in one part of the country have been hit with winter drought restrictions – warning them not to run baths or wash their cars over Christmas.

South East Water told residents of 65,000 homes in Sussex to take short showers instead of baths and to use washing machines and dishwashers only when there is a full load.

How it usually looks: Ardingly Reservoir, seven miles south of Crawley, is usually full this time of year

The measures have been introduced to help refill Ardingly Reservoir, seven miles south of Crawley, after water levels dropped to just 12 per cent at the end of November.

The water company blamed the problems on unseasonably low rainfall, but admitted it had been made worse by faulty measurements at the reservoir.

'Normally we would expect rainfall in 
the early autumn to replenish our reservoirs after the summer, but an 
exceptionally dry September, October and November raised the urgency of 
the situation,’ a spokesman said.

'South East Water monitors its reservoir levels, but during its more detailed investigations as part of its drought planning it found the relationship between levels and volume led to an overestimation of the storage available.’

The only time a winter drought order has previously been issued during the winter was in December 2003 in the North West.

But this year’s topsy-turvy weather has seen several counties remain in drought for several months after the lowest rainfall on record.

The East of England had only half its usual rainfall in September and October, following the driest spring for 80 years.

Northamptonshire, Cambridgeshire and South Lincolnshire have had their driest year on record.

Forceasters say that the unseasonal weather is set to continue – all but killing off hopes of a white Christmas.

In
fact, Christmas Day is expected to be wet and warm, with temperatures 
hitting 57f (14c), close to the record of 60f (15.6c) set in 1896 near 
Edinburgh. Following two snowy, ultra-cold Decembers, the festive season
starts today with temperatures of 54f (12c) in England and Wales, which
will be cloudy with rain moving south.

Tomorrow, Christmas Eve, should be generally fine. The high of 57f on Christmas Day is likely to be reached in Scotland. In England and Wales it will be cloudy, with some drizzle, and temperatures of 55f (13c).

There will be similar temperatures on Boxing Day, which will see Scotland and Northern Ireland having more rain, while in England and Wales it will be dry, but cloudy.

Rachel Vince, forecaster with MeteoGroup UK, said: 'It’s certainly going to be very mild, although there’s going to be quite a lot of rain in places.’
