Thousands of flights were canceled, students got an extra day off from school or were being sent home early, and the federal government closed its offices in the Washington area on Tuesday as another winter storm bore down on the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.

The National Weather Service said winter storm Janus could bring 10 to 14 inches of snow to Philadelphia and southern New England and up to a foot in New York City, followed by bitter cold.

An arctic air mass will plunge the eastern half of the United States into a deep freeze, with wind chills as low as 40 degrees below zero, the weather service said.

About 2,900 flights were canceled and thousands more delayed today, with airports from Washington to Boston affected. An additional 450 flights for Wednesday were already canceled.

From Virginia the storm will sweep north to Maine with at least half a foot of snow expected.

Coastal areas are on high alert for blizzard conditions which will set in from Tuesday afternoon into the evening.

Conditions are not expected to be as brutal as the 'polar vortex' three weeks ago but most of the U.S. will still face a significant drop in temperature.

be closed on Tuesday due to the winter storm bearing down on the

Light
 snow fell on Monday afternoon across the Great 
Lakes and down through the Ohio River Valley. By Monday
evening, residents in Minnesota experienced -20F temperatures.

The grim forecast caused airlines to cancel 1,449 Tuesday flights as of late Monday evening, according to FlightAware.

'The cold may be intense enough to cause school closings, frozen pipes and water main breaks,' according to AccuWeather.com meteorologist Alex Sosnowski on Monday.

'Heating systems may
 struggle to keep up, people will spend more money keeping their homes 
and businesses warm and ice will again build up on area rivers.'

Highs will range from the teens to 
lower 20s and the cold spell could extend as far south as Florida, which
 saw its lowest temperatures of the year so far on Sunday.

The
 snow is expected to intensify as it moves past the Appalachians early 
on Tuesday bringing around six inches to mountainous regions. However the north and east can expect to bear the brunt of the storm.

'Even though the storm is coming 
during the day Tuesday, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Roanoke and 
Richmond, Virginia, Dover, Delaware, Philadelphia, New York City, and Atlantic City, New Jersey, will have enough snow to shovel and plow,' Accuweather's Brian Wimer said.

He added: 'For Washington, D.C., this could be the biggest storm since January 26, 2011, when about 5 inches of snow fell.'

Lows are expected to remain in the subzero range on Tuesday night. While New England could see highs of about 20F on Wednesday, the upper Midwest probably won't see temperatures above the teens.

While the winter blast is expected to
 be gone by Thursday, meteorologists predict it will be followed by 
another blast of cold air pushing down from Canada on Friday or Saturday.

Snow
 is possible as far south as Greenville, South Carolina and Raleigh, 
North Carolina on Tuesday. These areas can expect up to an inch of snow by evening.

To
 the Southwest, California and 
adjoining regions can expect continued problems from the historic 
drought already plaguing the region.

Overall, temperatures Thursday will be warmer than the previous few days, however a return of the dreaded polar plunge is expected by weekend

The state is in a period of extended dry weather compounded in Southern California by repeated periods of the regional Santa Anas, dry and powerful winds.

The dry conditions statewide led Governor
 Jerry Brown to formally declare a drought on Friday in order to seek federal assistance.

The
 statewide water content was about 20 per cent of average for this time 
of year. The snow water equivalent on Thursday was just 17 per cent of 
normal for the day.

Nevada snowpack - an important source of water come spring - shows a

Paired with record heat, the conditions have also helped lead to a ring of fierce wildfires around Los Angeles.

The Los Angeles County Fire Department said the fire was 78 per cent contained by Sunday with full containment expected on Wednesday.

The California Conference of Catholic Bishops asked people of all faiths to join in prayers for rain.

Sacramento Bishop Jaime Soto, president of the bishops' conference, suggested a prayer for God to 'open the heavens and let His mercy rain down upon our fields and mountains.'

He suggested prayers for relief and for the wellbeing of those most at risk from a water shortage. Mosques in the Central Valley also prayed for rain earlier this month.
