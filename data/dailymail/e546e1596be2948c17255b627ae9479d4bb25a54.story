Patients with suspected cancer are being refused urgent tests by NHS managers in a ploy to meet waiting times targets, senior doctors have warned.

Some patients have their cancer risk ‘downgraded’ and are told they do not qualify for the two-week track. They are then not seen for up to six months.

Many are later confirmed to have cancer and campaigners warn that such lengthy delays are putting lives at ‘serious risk’.

Patients with suspected cancer are being refused urgent tests by NHS managers in a ploy to meet waiting times targets, senior doctors have warned

Cancer survival rates in Britain are notoriously lower than those elsewhere in Europe and this has partly been blamed on GPs not picking up the early warning signs, and referring patients for tests.

But an investigation by Pulse magazine has identified that doctors are increasingly having referrals ‘bounced back’ by hospital managers who say patients are unlikely to have cancer, so can wait longer.

One, Dr John Ashcroft, based in Ilkeston, Derbyshire, said an elderly man was made to wait two months for a scan to diagnose bowel cancer which should have been done within two weeks.

Speaking about a general trend, he added: ‘Absolutely this is happening.

‘If a case doesn’t quite fill the guidance for two-week referral even though clinically you think it is important it gets bounced and you have to make a normal referral.’

Another, Dr Gillian Breeze, who practises in Llandudno, North Wales, said a man with suspected bowel cancer was downgraded to only needing a routine scan in 25 weeks’ time – six months.

The patient gave up and paid for the colonoscopy check himself, privately, which confirmed he had cancer.

Dr Breeze said: ‘His decision to have consultation and colonoscopy privately much quicker may have changed his eventual outcome, as after a 25-week wait on NHS the prognosis may have been very different.’

Duleep Allirajah, of the charity Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘When GP’s suspect cancer or want to access more diagnostic tests it is essential they are able to do this easily and quickly.

‘It’s simply not good enough that some people with cancer face waits of up to 25 weeks following an urgent GP referral.

‘Delays mean that thousands of people with cancer must put their lives on hold while waiting for vital treatment - causing anxiety, distress and putting their lives at serious risk.

‘Each individual hospital has a responsibility to meet waiting time targets.

‘This is yet again another clear warning sign that the system isn’t working and the NHS is under huge strain.’

Under NHS guidelines, GPs are instructed to refer patients for urgent hospital scans or tests to be carried out within the next two weeks if they suspect cancer.

Doctors fax or email a form detailing the patients’ symptoms and why they think they might have a particular type of tumour.

Hospital staff are then meant to schedule them in for an appointment with an appropriate consultant specialist who will arrange a scan.

But doctors suspect that managers at Clinical Commissioning Groups - local organisations who control NHS budgets – are trying to limit the referrals to ensure their hospital hits target and avoids being fined.

These managers will have no medical expertise and will simply turn patients away by looking through their form.

NHS targets stay that 93 per cent of patients urgently referred with suspected cancer by GPs are seen by the hospital within two weeks otherwise it is fined tens of thousands of pounds.

Professor Greg Rubin, who specialises in general practice and primary care at the University of Durham, said he understood why managers were trying to limit referrals in order not to have cancer targets breached.

‘It’s interesting that this is appearing and that kind of bears out what I had heard anecdotally.’

Earlier this year, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt pledged to name and shame GP surgeries which were referring too few patients for cancer scans on the NHS Choices website.

Then last month, the health watchdog NICE urged family doctors to refer patients for tests for seemingly banal symptoms such as tiredness, a cough, or bleeding in case it was cancer.

But such measures will prove futile if GPs’ referrals are just sent back by managers.
