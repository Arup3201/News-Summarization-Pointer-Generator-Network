Gordon Strachan insists he has no need to lay down the law to any of his Scotland players.

The issue of professionalism among footballers was again raised after the Scots' skipper Scott Brown was pictured apparently slumped in the street after an alleged drunken night out in Edinburgh last Wednesday.

After his Hoops side lifted the Scottish League Cup with a 2-0 win over Dundee United at Hampden on Sunday, manager Ronny Deila was at pains to stress his midfielder had not broken any rules although he conceded the incident had not been 'a positive example' for youngsters.

Gordon Strachan says he hasn't brought in any new rules over his Scotland squad in light of Scott Brown's 

Strachan was speaking at the national stadium after announcing his squad for the home friendly against Northern Ireland and the Euro qualifier against Gibraltar later in the month.

The former Celtic boss has implemented an alcohol ban for all those on Scotland duty and believes that is enough.

'I haven't made rules,' said Strachan.

'The only one is the alcohol thing, which is for everybody, not just the players and that hasn't been broken in two and half years.

'Nobody has broken anything, no one has affected anything in the two and half years so I don't have to make rules.

'The players have been immaculate. When they are within my jurisdiction, when I have been responsible, they have been absolutely fantastic.'
