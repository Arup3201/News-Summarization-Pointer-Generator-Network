Surveillance video has captured the moment bombs exploded in Russia killing four people. 

The bombings took place on Monday in Russia's volatile North Caucasus region, the Ministry of Health's website says.

One of the two bombs was discovered by police who called in a bomb squad to diffuse it.

Investigation: Two bombs exploded killing four people in Dagestan where armed groups are waging an Islamist insurgency

But before this could be done, the bomb went off causing a minor explosion. 

However, as crowds gathered, the second and more powerful bomb went off resulting in casualties. 

Forty-four people were injured of which thirty-one were hospitalised, it says.

The incident, which occurred in Makhachkala, the capital of the semi-autonomous republic of Dagestan, also caused significant damage to the area. 

It is believed law enforcement officers may have been the target because the explosion happened outside a marshasls building.

Islamists have taken hold in the North Caucasus and there is a strong presence of Islamic militants fighting Moscow's rule.

Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the suspects in the Boston Marathon terror attack last month, had ties with the region.

The brothers are ethnic Chechens who lived in Kyrgyzstan and Dagestan.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is in custody. His older brother died after a shootout with police just outside Boston days after the bombing.

Security forces announced on Monday that they had foiled a terror attack against Moscow.

According to a spokesman at the National Anti-Terror Committee, security forces killed two militants and detained another. 

All three are described as Russian citizens trained in Afghanistan and Pakistan, he said.
