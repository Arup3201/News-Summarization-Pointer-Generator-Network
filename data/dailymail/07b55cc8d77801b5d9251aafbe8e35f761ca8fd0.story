Worst nightmare: A man broke into this home in Oxnard, California on Friday and molested a 12-year-old boy sleeping inside 

On the loose: The boy woke up and called for his parents who ordered the molester to leave. He got away before police arrived. Above, a picture of one of the home's windows shows a cut window screen 

The man then allegedly started sexually assaulting the boy, who was able to get the attention of his parents. 

The child's parents confronted the man and told him to leave the house. He got away before police arrived. 

So far, the suspect has only been identified as a Hispanic man  in his 20s, about 6 feet tall with a slender build. 

Neighborhood resident Monique Tazbeen was shocked to hear about the break in. 

"I've never seen a problem. It's always been really calm. The families seem to be really nice,' she told KTLA. 'There are a lot of kids around here and that's scary.' 

Anyone with information on the prowler is being asked to call the Oxnard Police Department at 805-385-3921 or the Ventura County Crime Stoppers at 805-222-8477.
