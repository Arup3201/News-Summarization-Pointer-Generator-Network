Malcolm Simpson denies two charges of causing death by dangerous driving, and two alternative charges of causing death by careless driving

Two men who stopped on a motorway hard shoulder to change a tyre were killed instantly when a articulated lorry crashed straight into them.

Victims Philip Cawley and Thomas Southward were 'sitting ducks' when the lorry drifted into the hard shoulder of the M6, killing them instantly, Chester Crown Court heard today.

Lorry driver Malcolm Simpson, 61, of Selby, Yorkshire, denies two charges of causing death by dangerous driving, and two alternative charges of causing death by dangerous driving.

Another lorry driver who witnessed the crash told how it was like a scene from the film Final Destination where he could see what was going to happen but was powerless to stop it.

Prosecuting barrister Simon Parry said that on the morning of September 10, Mr Cawley, 39, of Ashton in Makerfield and Mr Southward, 69, of Haydock, St Helens, left their homes for what they would have imagined to have a normal day at work for them.

Their job was to travel to Stoke-on-Trent and pick up some vehicles for delivery to an auction centre in Haydock.

'A flat tyre on one of the vehicles being towed started the terrible chain of events that led to their tragic deaths in quite horrific circumstances,' Mr Parry told the jury as he opened the case.

They stopped their vehicles on the hard shoulder of the north bound M6 motorway near Sandbach and the two men started to change the defective wheel themselves.

The pair were killed minutes later when Simpson's lorry smashed into them.

Mr Parry said that one of the issues that the jury would have to determine in the case - probably the central issue - was whether the defendant had suffered any medical episode while at the wheel causing him to lose consciousness and control of the vehicle.

It was claimed by the defence that he may have suffered the effects of a mini stroke.

The tragic collision had been captured by a Highways Agency motorway camera and also on the on-board camera of a VOSA vehicle which was passing the scene at the time.

Simpson had left Felixstowe at about 06.10am heading for Ashton-under-Lyne and stopped for breakfast on the A14 at Northamptonshire and for fuel north of Birmingham.

Moments before the impact eyewitness Darren Moran was driving a HGV when he saw the defendant move out into lane three where HGVs were prohibited.

The defendant suddenly corrected himself back into lane two in a jerky movement, said Mr Moran. Then he saw the defendant's lorry drift into the hard shoulder before coming back into lane one.

But within a second or so the defendant was going back onto the hard shoulder, it was claimed, and Mr Moran could see the people ahead at the parked vehicles.

'He described it like the film Final Destination where he could see what was going to happen but was powerless to stop it,' Mr Parry explained.

He estimated that about half of the defendant's vehicle was on the hard shoulder and that the two men were sitting ducks.

'All he could do was desperately push hard on his horn with both hands to try and get the defendant's attention,' Mr Parry added.

'The defendant neither slowed or braked and the next thing Mr Moran heard was a bang.'

The pathology evidence was that both men died instantaneously when hit. Out of respect to them and their families, Mr Parry said that he would not describe in any detail the severity of their injuries.

At the scene it was claimed that the defendant said that one of the victims must have stepped into the road because he never went over 'the rumble strips'.

He also said he could not move over because of a foreign vehicle behind him - but the films showed that neither claim was true, said Mr Parry.

Interviewed, he said that he just felt a bang or a bump and did not know what he had hit and claimed that he had not entered the hard shoulder.

But when the CCTV footage was shown to him he answered no comment. He also said that he had in the past suffered mini-strokes.

'The prosecution say quite bluntly that the idea that he suffered any kind of attack that caused him to lose control of his vehicle is a complete red herring,' said Mr Parry.

'The driving that you can so graphically see is that of a lorry driver who is either paying no attention to his driving or drifting in and out of sleep.

'That is grossly irresponsible and quite simply dangerous.' The trial, before The Recorder of Chester, Judge Elgan Edwards, continues.
