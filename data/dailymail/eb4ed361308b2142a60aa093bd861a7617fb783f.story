Hospitalized: Joan Rivers has been moved out of intensive care and into a private room. The 81-year-old comedienne stopped breathing during throat surgery last week

Joan Rivers has been moved into a private room and is being kept comfortable, her daughter has revealed.

Melissa Rivers provided an update on her mother's condition on Wednesday, explaining that the 81-year-old comedienne has been moved from intensive care.

'My mother has been moved out of intensive care and into a private room where she is being kept comfortable,' she said. 'Thank you for your continued support.' 

She made no reference to whether or not her mother's condition has improved. 

Rivers suffered cardiac arrest and stopped breathing during minor throat surgery on her vocal chords at a New York City hospital last Thursday. 

She was left fighting for her life amid fears she might be left a 'vegetable', but friends have since dismissed these claims and said she is improving day by day at Mount Sinai Hospital.

Her daughter Melissa flew from Los Angeles following the incident and has remained at her bedside.

The comedy stalwart had reportedly laughed about undergoing 'a little procedure' ahead of her operation.

Worried: Rivers' daughter Melissa has been by her mother's bedside since the beginning of her health crisis 

Her friend Jay Redack, who was turned away by security when he tried to visit her in hospital, was one of the last people to spend time with her and said she was in good spirits before the surgery.

They had enjoyed dinner on Wednesday night after her hour-long stand-up session at the Laurie Beechman Theatre in Times Square.

'She said her throat was bothering her for a long time,' he told the New York Daily News. 'Her voice was getting more raspy, if that was possible. She said she was just going in for a little procedure in the morning, that was it.'
