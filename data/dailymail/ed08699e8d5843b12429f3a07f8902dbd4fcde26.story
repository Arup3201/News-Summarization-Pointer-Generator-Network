A river otter has attacked two teenage cousins as they played on a rope swing in a US river, in scenes described by their grandmother as 'like something out of Jaws'.

Kierra Clark, 13, and Matalyn Longtain, 11, were playing in the Kalama River near their grandparents' home in Washington state when Kierra felt a sharp pain in her leg.

When she looked back she saw a river otter glaring back at her with 'huge eyes' popping out of the water and teeth she described as 'sharp and long'.

When otters attack: Kierra Clark, 13, was playing in the Kalama River near her grandparents' home when she felt a sharp pain in her leg

Painful: When Kierra got out of the water she found she had multiple wounds where the otter's teeth had punctured her flesh

Peaceful: Craig Bartlett of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife said river otters don't usually attack people but the girls had perhaps got between an adult otter and its babies

'At first it felt like somebody was 
just, like, grabbing onto my leg with their nails, and then it felt like
 somebody was like stabbing me kind of,' Kierra told Katu.com. 'It was 
probably one of the scariest things ever.

'I didn’t really know what was in the water at first, so that was 
like the worst thing ever because that’s like my biggest fear is to be 
attacked in the water.'

As they swam faster they continued to feel bites on their legs and ankles. Kicking their assailants away they clambered onto a float of canoes where they were dragged to the shore by their grandfather Bob Schlecht Jr. and his friend Fred Palmer.

'It was terrifying,' Kierra’s grandmother, Arlita Schlecht, who helped in the rescue told Katu.com. 'I could see she had blood streaming down her leg. (It was like) a scene out of Jaws.'

Scene: The cousins were swimming in the Kalama River in Washington state

attack has shaken the quiet community where otters are generally seen as peaceful creatures.

'I’ve been here 60-some years and never seen anything like it,” said Fred Palmer 'And there’s always kids out there swimming in the summer.'

The Daily News reports a fish biologist

Craig Bartlett of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife said river otters don’t usually attack people but maybe the girls got between an adult otter and its babies.

He said many animals have newborn babies this time of year and can be protective and aggressive.

And while otter attacks are unusual they are not unheard of, especially this time of year. The girls plan to get back in the water as soon as they cuts are completely healed.
