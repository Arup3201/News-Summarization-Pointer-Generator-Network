He's famous for his brutal putdowns, the worst of which have been directed at Pippa Middleton, Michelle Obama and Adele among others. And now the best of Karl Lagerfeld's quotes are to be immortalised in a new book.

The World According To Karl is the brainchild of Patrick Mauriés, Jean-Christophe Napias and Sandrine Gulbenkian, and will feature illustrations by artist Charles Ameline.

But the star of the show is to be a hand-picked collection of Lagerfeld's bitchiest bons mots, including lines such as: 'Sweatpants are a sign of defeat. You lost control of your life so you bought some sweatpants.'

Brutal: Chanel Creative Director Karl Lagerfeld is famous for his catty quips and bitchy comments

Although the Chanel designer wasn't involved with writing the book, which is due to be released in September, it does allegedly have his seal of approval.

In recent years, Lagerfeld has become almost as famous for his quips as he has for his design prowess, having taken a swipe at everyone from the entire nation of Greece to, yes, the younger MIddleton sister.

In the days following the royal wedding in 2011, the designer gave an interview to a German magazine, during the course of which he revealed his dislike of Middleton Minor.

He said: 'Kate Middleton has a nice silhouette and she is the right girl for that boy. I like that kind of woman, I like romantic beauties.

'On the other hand, her sister struggles. I don't like the sister's face. She should only show her back.'

He followed that rattle of invective with a critique of the fashion on show during the celebrations, saying: 'This was not a collection, this was the choices of this kind of woman for this kind of ceremony: the bad proportions, the ugly hats, the short skirts on fat legs.'

Fat is a favourite topic of Karl's, who caused outrage a year later when he took a pop at British singer, Adele, describing her as 'a little too fat', although he drew the sting slightly by calling her beautiful and adding that her voice is 'divine'.

Not content with upsetting Adele and the Middletons, he then went on to ask whether any part of singer Lana del Rey was real, before surpassing himself by offending the whole of Russia.

'If I was a woman in Russia I would be a lesbian, as the men are very ugly,' he quipped.

'There are a few handsome ones, like Naomi Campbell's boyfriend, but there you see the most beautiful women and the most horrible men.'

The victims: Both Michelle Obama and Pippa Middleton have been on the receiving end of a Karl quip

Another country to feel the sting of Karl's tongue was Greece, after the designer weighed into the debate on the nation's financial crisis and corruption problems.

'Greece needs to work on a cleaner image,' he advised. 'It's a big problem, as they have this reputation of being so corrupt.

'You can't be sure the money will go where it's supposed to go. Nobody wants Greece to disappear, but they have really disgusting habits. Italy as well.'

He's even had a crack at the Press, most recently at Newsweek, whose editor, Tina Brown, ran a story that claimed Lagerfeld was overrated.

'First of all, Tina Brown's magazine is not doing well at all,' he riposted. 'She is dying. I'm sorry for Tina Brown, who was such a success at Vanity Fair, to go down with a s***ty little paper like this. I'm sorry.'

Collection: The new book, which is out in September, includes 50 of Karl's best and bitchiest quotes

On short, unattractive people: 'Life is not a beauty contest, some [ugly people] are great. What I hate is nasty, ugly people... the worst is ugly, short men. Women can be short, but for men it is impossible. It is something that they will not forgive in life... they are mean and they want to kill you.'

On people who complain about thin models: 'They are fat mummies sitting with their bags of crisps in front of the television, saying that thin models are ugly.'

On former friend and Chanel muse, Inès de la Fressange: 'I wish her all the luck in the world, just so long as I don't have to see her anymore or hear her spoken about.'

On pop star, Seal: 'I am no dermatologist but I wouldn't want his skin. Mine looks better than his. He is covered in craters.'

On Heidi Klum: 'I don't know Heidi Klum. She was never known in France. Claudia Schiffer also doesn't know who she is.'

On fur: 'It is farmers who are nice to the cows and the pigs and then kill them. It's even more hypocritical than hunters. At least the hunters don't flatter the animals....I don't like that people butcher animals, but I don't like them to butcher humans either, which is apparently very popular in the world.'

On the Queen: 'She looks a little bit like her grandmother - a more smiley version. "In terms of what she wears, she's come into herself a little bit more - whatever that is.'

On Michelle Obama: 'I don't understand the change of hair. I adore Madame Obama, I love her. But there is a news reader at LCI which has this haircut...Frankly, this doesn't suit her. The fringe was a bad idea, it's not good.'

On Adele: 'The thing at the moment is Adele. She is a little too fat, but she has a beautiful face and a divine voice.'

On Lana del Rey: 'Is she a construct with all her implants?'
