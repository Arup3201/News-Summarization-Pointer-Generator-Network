Controversy: Argentinian politician Juan Cabandie was filmed making a phone call complaining that he had been pulled over for a traffic offence. The traffic officer who stopped him was later sacked

Video footage has emerged of an Argentine politician who was fined for driving without insurance making a phone call which led to the traffic officer who pulled him over losing her job.

Government minister Juan Cabandie remonstrated with Buenos Aires officer, Belen Mosquera, in an unsuccessful bid to escape paying the fine he faced.

The footage shows him telling the officer that he was a son of 'los desaperecidos' in reference to his parents being kidnapped by the military junta during Argentina's so-called Dirty War.

He told Ms Mosquera: 'You think you are brave, well I am braver. I survived the dictatorship, I am the son of The disappeared.'

But an unmoved Ms Mosquera, 28, told Cabandie that she was only doing her job and attempted to get him to sign the fine for driving while uninsured.

Cabandie was unaware that a colleague of the officer was filming the exchange and he was caught on camera accusing her of trying to get money out of him in return for avoiding the fine.

In the edited clip, he is then seen to make a phone call to 'Martin's office', believed to be Martin Insurralde, the mayor of the Lomas de Zamora municipality of Buenos Aires.

He is heard to say: 'Pass this information to Martin, not to get her sacked but so that she gets disciplined , because this is an affront'

Within days, Ms Mosquera had lost her job.

Although the incident took place in May the footage has only just come to light and has sparked outrage in Argentina.

It will do nothing to abate allegations of deep seated corruption that has dogged Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner's party in recent years ahead of a key mid-term election vote later this month.

One Facebook user said: 'It's an awesome glimpse into how rotten, abusive and stupidly corrupt these 'Socio-democrats' are.'

Cabandie was born in captivity after his mother and father were both abducted by the military junta in Argentina in 1978.

Embarrassing: Cabandie is a member of Argentine President Cristina Kirchner's party

At just 15 days old, he was separated from his mother who was being kept at ESMA - an illegal detention centre where prisoners were kept during the so-called National Reorganization Process of Argentina's 1976â€“1983 military dictatorship.

He only discovered that he had been adopted by a new family in 2003.

He was elected as a deputy in Buenos Aires in 2007 after running as a candidate for the Frente para la Victoria (Front for Victory) party.

Although he was only elected as a reserve candidate, he took a seat when one of his colleagues stood down.
