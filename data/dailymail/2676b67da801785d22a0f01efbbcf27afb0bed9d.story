The Christmas Truce of 1914 was a brief moment of humanity amid the horrors of the First World War.

But when Tommies and German troops emerged from the trenches to shake hands and swap gifts in no man’s land, the festive goodwill clearly did not extend to the French, a newly discovered letter reveals.

Lance Corporal William Loasby tells how a shared contempt for Britain’s Gallic ally in the Great War helped the opposing sides briefly find common ground when they met, with one German officer even remarking: ‘Ten Frenchman don’t make an Englishman.’

Living history: A letter written by the soldier who sparked the famous 1914 Christmas Day Truce between the German and British soldiers has been sold for £20,000 at auction. Pictured is auctioneer Richard Westwood-Brookes holding the letter written by Lance Corporal Willie Loasby

The eight-page pencilled note was sent by Lance Corporal Willie Loasby of the 2nd Northamptonshire Regiment to his mother on December 27, 1914

Willie Loasby was probably shot by someone he was fraternising with on Christmas Day

Soldiers emerged from their trenches along parts of the Western Front and met each other in no man's land on December 25, 1914

In his letter to his mother, Lance Corporal Loasby, 25, of the 2nd Northamptonshire Regiment, tells how he and a comrade met two Germans between their trenches, which were just 40 yards apart.

One of the Germans was an officer who shook hands, then asked in English: ‘Are you all English in front there, and no French?’

Lance Corporal Loasby wrote: ‘I answered, “All English, no French”. He replied, “I thought so”. Then he said, “Ten Frenchman don’t make an Englishman”. I thought, “Compliments”.

‘He weighed me up and down. Gave me six cigars, some chocolate, shook hands again and turned about, went back to his trench.’

The letter is expected to fetch up to £20,000 when it is sold at auction in March. Lance Corporal Loasby describes the Christmas event as ‘a remarkable experience… unbelievable I should say, had it happened to anyone else’.

But in the letter, dated December 27, 1914, he adds: ‘We are at each others’ throats again now.’ The letter was discovered by a collector who bought it unwittingly in a house clearance sale, historical documents expert Richard Westwood Brookes of auctioneers Mullock’s said yesterday.

Lance Corporal Loasby tells how his meeting with the officer came after an earlier encounter with another German in no man’s land on Christmas Eve. He asked if the British would stop firing on Christmas Day and Boxing Day so the Germans could bury their dead.

‘I asked my officer about the two days Armistice he wanted but no, he could not give it. But we would not fire unless we had orders otherwise on Xmas day,’ the letter adds.

Lance Corporal Loasby is believed to have died just two weeks after writing the letter. He was buried in Guards Cemetery near the French village of Cuinchy. His name appears on a war memorial in Kettering, Northamptonshire.

The letter’s insight into the reality of the events of the 1914 truce is a contrast to the rather idealised vision of life in the trenches depicted in Sainsbury’s Christmas TV ad. The ad has attracted more than 700 complaints, mainly from those who feel it is ‘distasteful’ to use war to sell groceries.

The Duke of Cambridge, who was joined by England manager Roy Hodgson, said the story was a 'message of hope and humanity'.

He added: 'Football had the power to bring people together and break down barriers. It is vital that 100 years on we keep the Christmas truce story alive.

'For future generations this memorial will help ensure that not just football, but also a nation, remembers.'

Supermarket giant Sainsbury's has also made it the centrepiece of its Christmas ad campaign this year.

'On Thursday afternoon day before Xmas we stood shouting at the Germans in English (we can speak no German).

'They answered by calling us English Pigs and something a bit worse, well things went on like that for some time and matters improved and we asked them if they thought their people were in London.

'This happened in the section of trench I was in charge of between myself and a couple of men of my section. The Germans only being 40 yards away and we being nearer than at any other part of the line around here.

'Well the fellow next to me asked the German to stand right up, saying he would not shoot. The German did, then I asked him to come out of the trench and meet one of us half way and talk.

'He hesitated, but I assured him we would not shoot, if his fellows would not and to prove we meant it we stepped out of the trench and walked across towards them, all eyes were now watching this (the fellow I have just mentioned took our last loaf of bread the only one we had between about 10 of us, and gave it to the German, biting a bit off at the same time to let him know we had not poisoned it.

'Well everyone was now clapping both British and German and the Germans also shouted 'Brave English'.

I walked across to my man and shook hands, I asked him how he liked it. 'Terrible, I wish I was back in Germany (in Good English!).

'I said, are you losing many men. He said 'yes & could I make arrangements with my officer commanding to have Xmas day and Boxing to bury their dead and not firing. I said I would ask for him.

'I wanted a souvenir so I took my knife out of my pocket and he let me cut a button from his coat. I could only give him a few dirty old biscuits from my pocket...on Xmas day I called up my friend the German and we met again halfway.

'Now out steps a German officer and comes up to me. The officer says, after shaking hands and in Good English 'Are you all English in front there and no French'. I answered, 'All English, no French.' He replied, 'I thought so', then said 'Ten Frenchman don't make an Englishman'. I thought: 'Compliments'.

'He weighed me up and down, gave me six cigars, some chocolate, shook hands again and turned about, went back to his trench. The other chap gave me a knife as a souvenir.

'I said jokingly if he would play us a game of football. He said 'yes' then I got called in again and we were soon banging away at them again.

'But what makes it so strange to me is on each side of us they were still fighting and an officer who ordered his men to fire volleys into them when they were asking to speak had his head blown off a few hours afterwards.

'Of course we have had to forget all about that now we are at each others' throats again...'
