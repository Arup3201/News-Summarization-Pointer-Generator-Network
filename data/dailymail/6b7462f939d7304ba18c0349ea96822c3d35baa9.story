Aggressive ground assaults aided by a flurry of Coalition airstrikes have forced ISIS from its territory in Syria and Iraq.

10 separate bombardments in a 24-hour period helped Kurdish and Christian fighters recapture a strategic village from the militants in north-eastern Syria.

And a 20,000-strong force in Iraq is reportedly 'one week away' from taking back the city of Tikrit - former President Saddam Hussein's home town.

Battle: Despite ISIS propaganda on its social media channels (pictured), it has lost control in both Iraq and Syria thanks to aggressive ground attacks by regional soldiers

Propaganda: The militants have released pictures of YPG targets in Al-Hasakah being destroyed (pictured) but the reality is they have been dispelled from the province which lies near the border with Iraq

Strategic: Losing the territory is a massive blow to ISIS due to its proximity to the Iraq border, which gave them an easy supply route to the country 

A joint force of Christian and Kurdish soldiers have now seized control of Tal-Maghas in Syria's Al-Hasakah province.

Previously under Islamic State's tyrannical control, the village which lies just 200km east of its adopted capital of Raqqa gave them an easy supply route into neighbouring Iraq.

Syria's main Kurdish force  the People's Protection Unit (YPG) called for air support in the region on Friday following weeks of intense ground fighting which killed dozens on both sides.

Airstrikes since the request have struck one of Islamic State's tactical units and destroyed a 'fighting position', the US military has revealed.

While in Iraq, four separate strikes took out a 'large fighting unit', two tactical units, four buildings and vehicles near the northern city of Kirkuk. 

Soldiers on the ground have had to pause their charge through the ISIS-held city of Tikrit as they wait for reinforcements.

Despite taking areas to the north and south, Islamic State fighters still hold about half the city, have booby-trapped buildings and laid roadside bombs making it a death-trap to traverse.

The pro-government force desperate to drive the extremists out of the city comprises 3,000 Iraqi troops, 20,000 militiamen and smaller factions of tribesmen.

Advantage: Taking Tikrit - former President Saddam Hussein's home town - could be a major turning point in the war against ISIS, Iraq's Defence Minister told

Even though pro-Iraqi soldiers (pictured) have taken areas to the north and south of Tikrit, Islamic State fighters still hold about half the city

One militia group's leader said ISIS still hold about 70 per cent of Tikrit's town centre but they would 'liberate' it even if street-to-street fighting was needed. 

Taking Tikrit could be a major turning point in the war against ISIS, Iraq's Defence Minister  told the BBC.

Khaled al-Obedi said the city was a stepping stone to other ISIS-held territory which includes the country's second largest city Mosul.

He added: 'The liberation of this city [Tikrit] and province will serve as a launch pad for reclaiming the north and the west of Iraq.

ISIS is also on the back foot in northern Iraq where militia forces and Kurdish peshmerga  stepped up their offensive on the oil-rich city of Kirkuk on Friday. 

They began attacking the militants' positions near the city on Monday and have since retaken territory and a number of villages to the south-west.

Kurdish commanders said they faced weak resistance but were held up by home-made bombs the extremists laid in the city before retreating to their stronghold of Hawijah.

The Kurdish YPG militia has emerged as the US-lead Coalition's main partner in combating ISIS on the ground in Syria.

It has made staggering advances in recent weeks and months by seizing a major supply route from Iraq and dispelling the militants from the city of Kobani.

The battle for Kobani was the first public example - and success - of Western forces closely coordinating with a regional ground force to battle ISIS.

The terror group tried to reassert its dominance last week when it retaliated using tanks and heavy weapons on YPG locations close to the Turkish border.

Its spokesman said the bombardment fell close to the town of Tal Tamer on Friday night through to Saturday morning.  

The UN estimates that 220,000 people have died as a result of Syria's horrific conflict which began five years ago.

Its special envoy and actress Angelina Jolie marked the tragic anniversary by urging 'governments around the world to put aside their differences and mount a new attempt to solve the conflict politically'.

She said: 'I appeal for urgent steps to demonstrate that the international community is serious about accountability in Syria, to show that we will not turn a blind eye to war crimes, and that we will not fail refugees, the displaced and the survivors.
