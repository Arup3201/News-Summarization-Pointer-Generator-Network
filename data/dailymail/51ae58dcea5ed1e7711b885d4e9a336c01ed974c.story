Iain Duncan Smith (pictured) said rules which allow expats abroad to claim up to £100m in winter fuel payments was 'ridiculous'

Iain Duncan Smith last night vowed to fight a ‘ludicrous’ European ruling allowing expats living in warm countries to claim a total of  up to £100million in winter fuel payments.

The European Court of Justice ruling means the Government must pay the annual handout worth as much as £300 to up to 444,000 British pensioners  living abroad.

The Work and Pensions Secretary is now considering bringing in a ‘temperature’ test so payments would only be made to those living in colder climates.

Mr Duncan Smith told the Daily Mail: ‘We will fight these ridiculous rules. The winter fuel payment is about helping British pensioners with heating costs and it is ludicrous we could have to pay more pensioners living in hot countries.’

He added: ‘We will protect taxpayers’ money and bring in a temperature criteria.’

Previously, the elderly could only qualify for the winter fuel allowance if they reached 60 before leaving Britain.

Anyone who left Britain before the payment was introduced in 1998 was also excluded.

But under the new rules claimants only need to ‘have a genuine and sufficient link with the UK’ including having ‘lived or worked in the UK for most of your working life’.

It means that anyone born on or before July 5, 1951, can now make a claim for the payment for winter fuel this year.

Any household with a pensioner qualifies for a payment of £200. Those with someone over 80 get £300. In the 2010-11 winter, 72,840 expats claimed winter fuel payments, or WFPs, at a total cost of almost £16million.

Under the changed rules, that  figure could be multiplied many times over.

There are some 444,000 people living in Europe who receive a UK state pension.

If they were to all claim the WFPs, the annual cost would rocket to almost £100million a year, at a time when the Government is being forced to make unprecedented spending cuts.

It is not possible to accurately estimate how many people will receive a payment for the first time as a result of this change, Mr Duncan Smith said, because not all will satisfy the criteria for a WFP.

Officials are now looking into how a temperature test might work. Any change in the WFP criteria would require new legislation.

There are some 60,000 OAPs  living in France, many of them based in the south where the average temperature in winter can be as high as 57F (13C).

In parts of Spain, where there are some 100,000 British OAPs, average temperatures in December and January can reach 63F (17C).

Many of the expatriates who have moved to such countries are middle-class retired people who have deliberately moved abroad to enjoy a better climate.

For elderly people solely surviving on a state pension or small employment pensions the WFP is a lifeline during particularly cold winters.

Some £100billion is spent providing benefits for the elderly, and  Mr Duncan-Smith has called for £5billion to be shaved off that total.

The Department for Work and Pensions said: ‘It is now possible people living in the European Economic Area and Switzerland may be entitled to Winter Fuel Payment.’
