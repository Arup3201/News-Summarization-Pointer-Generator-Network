Italian police are trying to trace relatives of a British woman whose mummified body was found in her house five months after she was last seen alive.

Susan Mount, 61, had not been seen since early August and her best friend informed police of her disappearance in October.

Her body was discovered after neighbours complained of a strong smell coming from her studio apartment in Tribiano, a small village near Milan.

They called a popular TV show which deals with tracing missing people, who referred the call to the emergency services.

Firefighters made the grim discovery 
after being authorised to break in - raising questions as to why police 
had not searched her flat when Miss Mount was reported missing.

Miss Mount, who was originally from Morecambe, Lancashire, had moved to the studio flat in Tribiano several years ago.

She had previously been married to an Italian man but the couple, who had no children together, were divorced.

Police said she was single but was thought to have relatives in England.

Major
Giuliano Gerbo, of the paramilitary Carabinieri police, said: 'We are 
trying to trace relatives of Susan Mount who we believe live in England.

'An initial inspection would suggest that she died from natural causes around the time she was last seen alive in August.

'She was only officially reported 
missing in October. But we also established that she would regularly 
holiday in Egypt for long periods of time, so we did not suspect a crime
had been committed and did not seek permission to break into the flat.

'After
receiving information from neighbours about the strong smell coming 
from the apartment we obtained permission from a local magistrate to 
enter and we discovered her mummified body.'

Emilia Ballio, Miss Mount's best friend in Italy, today recalled the last time she saw the British woman.

She said: 'The last time I spoke with Susan was back on 7 August on the telephone.

'I had seen her 
earlier that day and she was as happy as ever with a huge smile on her 
face. It never crossed my mind that I would never see her or hear from 
her again.

'I tried to call her a couple of times but there was no answer and so I went to the police and told them she was missing. I immediately had a bad feeling about her.

'The police said they would check it out but as she was over 18 and they did not suspect a crime there was not much they could do.

'When I said she often went on holiday to Egypt, they said she may well have gone away for a long break and they would keep it on file.

'I told them that she had not mentioned going away and if she did have something planned she would have told me, but they didn't act until her neighbours complained of the smell from the apartment.'

Franco Lucente, mayor of Tribiano, said: 'I met here a couple of times just before the summer. She had come in to ask about getting married but I'm not sure if it was for her or someone else.

'We at the council would just like to express our condolences to her family and friends and also offer to cover her funeral arrangements if no relatives are found.'
