Gangster: Curtis Warren is the first criminal to be the subject to a High Court order designed to stop him running his empire when he leaves jail

A notorious gangster has become the first to be banned from using payphones, carrying large sums of cash and having multiple bank accounts to stop him running his drug empire when he leaves jail.

Curtis Warren made more than £200million through his criminal empire 
and is the only drug trafficker to make it on to the Sunday Times Rich 
List.

The 49-year-old will be released from Belmarsh Prison in 2015 
after he was jailed for 13 years in 2009 over a £1million cannabis 
smuggling plot in Jersey.

Today Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer took the unprecedented step of applying to a High Court judge in London for a Serious Crime Prevention Order against the former Liverpool nightclub bouncer.

Designed to prevent reoffending, it will impose restrictions on Warren’s access to mobile phones and telephone kiosks as well as limitations on bank accounts.

The restrictions usually last for five years and Warren would be jailed for a maximum of five years if he breached any of them.

The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) has already had a serious 
crime prevention order granted which allows police to keep tabs on him 
and investigate his finances when he is released.

Mr Starmer said: 'Organised crime, and persons involved in it, cause real harm to communities and ruin countless lives. It is our duty to take proactive action to limit the abilities of criminals to do this and to make the United Kingdom a much harder place for such criminals to operate.

'Curtis Warren has a long history of serious offending at home and abroad. By agreeing today to this order being imposed, he has admitted that he has been involved in serious criminality.

'There are very real grounds to believe that, without this order being made, Curtis Warren would continue to be involved in serious crime. This order will severely curtail his ability to do so.'

Historic: The Order was obtained at the High Court today at the request of the CPS who want to control Warren on release

The exact terms of the order, which comes into effect on Warren's release, will be agreed at a later date.

Warren was originally set to contest the application but Mr Justice Turner heard today that he had submitted to summary judgment against him.

Warren was jailed in 1997 in the Netherlands when Dutch police seized a haul of drugs and banknotes worth £125m. But he claims to have little cash left after his bank account was frozen in 2011.

Between 1997 and 2007, Warren was locked up in the Netherlands' highest security jail after being found guilty of conspiring to import £100m worth of cocaine, heroin, ecstasy and cannabis, as well as firearms offences.

His sentence was extended in 1999 after he killed a fellow prisoner in a fight and was convicted of manslaughter.

Five weeks after being released he was arrested by Jersey police and accused of being the ringleader of a six-man gang who were trying to import 180kg of cannabis into the island from the Netherlands via a boat from France.

Warren is due before the Jersey courts later this month in connection with a £118million drugs deal.
