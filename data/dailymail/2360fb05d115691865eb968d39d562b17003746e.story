It's Hot or Not time again as Ian Ladyman reveals what's been making him feel warm this week and what's been leaving him cold inside. 

David Villa has hit the ground running in New York and Wayne Rooney's celebration was a knockout. But Fulham are staring at successive relegations and questions remain about Roy Hodgson's England squad.

WHAT'S HOT

DAVID VILLA

The former Spain forward is New York City FC’s captain and lit up Yankee Stadium in front of 45,000 last weekend, scoring one and making one. Meanwhile, Frank Lampard has played precisely two hours of Premier League football since choosing Manchester over New York in December.

WAYNE ROONEY

Great goal against Tottenham, great celebration too. After news of his kitchen boxing match with Phil Bardsley appeared in the Sun, though, there are lessons. Choose friends you can trust and never again be caught wearing white socks anywhere other than on a tennis court.

PAT MURPHY

Interviews by broadcast sports journalists can occasionally lack a little depth but BBC’s stalwart came off his long run when questioning national selector James Whitaker on the Kevin Pietersen issue this week. It was captivating work, born of courage and great experience.

GEOFF THOMAS

A good footballer but even better person, the former England player has kept cancer at bay for 12 years now and has raised thousands in the process. If his decision to ride several Tour stages with Lance Armstrong this summer does not please everyone I am sure he will cope.

WHAT'S NOT

FULHAM

Five years ago this week Craven Cottage witnessed a 4-1 destruction of Juventus. Now Fulham are threatened with relegation from the Championship, having won once in thirteen games. This is what happens when you choose the wrong managers.

ROY HODGSON

An England squad with almost as many left-backs (three) as strikers (four) suggests Hodgson is about to experiment with 7-2-1 against Lithuania or doesn’t actually know where Leighton Baines plays. It’s a dispiriting selection and tells us all we need to know about our prospects at Euro 2016.

ALASTAIR COOK

English cricket’s sense of self-pity has now spread to those who haven’t even been playing. Cook should realise that although the decision to appoint Eoin Morgan as World Cup captain wasn’t right, it doesn’t mean that jettisoning him beforehand was necessarily wrong.

RAHAT ALI

After his dropped catch eased Australia’s passage to the last four of the World Cup, the young Pakistan fielder looked shell shocked but the worst is yet to come. At some point in the coming weeks, young Ali will have to go home.
