Louis Saha has urged Manchester United to address their defensive problems in the January transfer window or risk missing out on the Champions League again.

United dropped to 10th place in the Barclays Premier League after Sunday's 1-0 derby defeat to Manchester City and Saha fears his former club could now finish outside the top four for the second successive season.

David Moyes was sacked last April just 10 months after succeeding Sir Alex Ferguson as United went from champions to seventh - their lowest league position for 25 years - and replaced by the experienced Dutchman Louis van Gaal.

'I hope they finish in top four but I can't be sure,' said Saha, who scored 42 goals in 124 appearances for United between 2004 and 2008.

'A club of this size should be looking for the fourth spot to be in the Champions League but it is not the case right now.

'You could say the issues are at the back but it's about balance, finding the right midfielder to keep the ball and a defender to be strong at a certain point of the game.

Former Fulham, United and Everton striker Saha was speaking at the DohaGOALS Conference in Qatar 

'It's difficult to predict what will happen but when you have a very balanced side you have balanced results.

'I'm not more experienced than Louis van Gaal to know what was a (defensive) regret for him but we will see at the end of the season, and what he does in this window this winter will be very important for Manchester United.'

Saha, speaking at the DohaGOALS Conference in Qatar, believes Van Gaal will get the time to turn around United that was not afforded to Moyes, who took the Frenchman from United to Everton in 2008.

But Saha said Van Gaal must listen to the concerns of the fans and add defensive strength in January to go with the impressive attacking armoury he now has at his disposal following a summer of heavy investment which saw Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao added to the likes of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata.

'You always have to listen to what people say and maybe the defence is a bit weak or not experienced enough,' Saha said.

'He (Van Gaal) has to look at it and address that point for sure, but he is an experienced manager so I've no doubt he will do so.

'I have seen a slight change and you can see there is a bit more confidence and a bit more shape, but the result is not what you would expect from a side like this.

'Time will definitely be on his side more than David Moyes because of the experience he has and the trophies in all his clubs.

'You expect the Premier League to be a difficult challenge for any team and Manchester United has been struggling in the last two years, but in football you have to make the transition as soon as possible.'

But Saha rejected criticism that United's failure to improve under Van Gaal was down to the Dutchman being surprised by the intensity of the Premier League.

'He's experienced, he has plenty of gigabytes of information and people there with him who know about football,' Saha said.

'It would be unthinkable for Manchester United not to be in the Champions League again but the Premier League is a different league to what it was 10 years ago.

'There are many teams that have got huge players and the quality is greater - that's why I stopped, I think!

'The level and intensity what you can show every week is amazing, there are no easy games.'
