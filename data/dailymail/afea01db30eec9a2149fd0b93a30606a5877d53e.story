German record-breaker Miroslav Klose has hailed Ronaldo as 'the most complete player ever' after surpassing the Brazilian's World Cup scoring record.

Klose's strike in Germany's 7-1 drubbing over host nation Brazil on Tuesday was his 16th across four tournaments and it moved him ahead of Ronaldo, who witnessed first hand the annihilation at the Estadio Mineirao. 

The 36-year-old centre forward was in reflective 
mood when asked by reporters about the feat at Germany's training base, 
choosing to praise the retired former Barcelona and Inter Milan star.

He said: 'He (Ronaldo) was an outstanding player. I play in Italy and everyone I've ever talked to there say that he was the best player that ever played in Italy. For me he was the most complete player ever.'

The 36-year-old did concede that the news would have come as a disappointment to Ronaldo, especially have to witness it live.

'Obviously it must be bitter for him that he was in the stadium when I overtook him in the match against Brazil,' added Klose.

'Before
 he sent a message out "Klose - welcome in the club of 15". I can now 
send out this message: "Miroslav Klose in the club of 16 and everyone's 
welcome to join".'
