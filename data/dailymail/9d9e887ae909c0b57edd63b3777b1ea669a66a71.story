A quadriplegic father made his daughter’s wedding day this weekend when he walked her down the aisle.

Augie Nieto, 56, who was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease, nearly a decade ago, was on hand to give away his youngest daughter, Lindsay, in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, Saturday.

Mr Nieto was diagnosed with the disease in 2005, and lost the use of his arms and legs within three years. A few years ago, he underwent a tracheotomy that left him unable to speak.

Important cause: Mr Nieto created Augie's Quest, which has raised nearly $40 million for ALS research since 2006

Lindsay, who was marrying Chris Williams, 28, said it meant a lot to have her father's blessing.

'I kind of thought that I would've 
been looking at Chris when I was walking down the aisle with Augie, but I
 couldn't look at anything but my dad,' Lindsay, 25, told TODAY.com.

'I was just amazed he was able to get in his device and stand up. The sun was in his eyes, and I was just thinking that he's done so much to be here and worked so hard that I just started bawling,' she added.

Moving moment: Mr Nieto was able to mouth 'I love you, and I'm so proud of you' to Lindsay

Guest of honor: 'I couldn't look at anything but my dad,' Lindsay, 25, said

Mr Nieto, who can still move his facial 
muscles, was able to mouth 'I love you, and I'm so proud of you' to 
Lindsay during the ceremony.

ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease,
 is a neurological disease that attacks the nerve cells responsible for 
controlling voluntary muscles.

According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, most people with ALS die from respiratory failure, often within three to five years from the onset of  symptoms, and only about 10per cent survive for 10 or more years.

Step by step: 'I was just amazed he was able to get in his device and stand up,' Lindsay said

Mr Nieto, the fitness mogul behind Lifecycle, Life Fitness and Octane Fitness, created Augie's Quest, which has raised nearly $40 million for ALS research since 2006.

Mr Nieto now communicates with a special device that allows him to a maneuver a roller-mouse and clicker with his feet. According to the Orange County Register, he has spent more than $200,000 on language software that predicts the words he's looking for based on letters he's selected.

'It's like surfing,' he said.
