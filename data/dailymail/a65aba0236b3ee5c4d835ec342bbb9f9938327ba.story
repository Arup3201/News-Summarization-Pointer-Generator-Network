Expectant mother Zara Phillips has admitted she has been bored since giving up horse-riding – so she has turned to baking instead.

The Queen’s granddaughter, who is due to give birth in the new year, was reluctant to abandon riding when she first announced that she was having a baby.

But now that she has stopped, the professional three-day eventer revealed that she is finding the lack of activity difficult and has turned to the kitchen to fill her time.

Baby on board: Zara Phillips, pictured at the Brightling International Horse Trials in July, was reluctant to  abandon riding when she first announced her pregnancy, but has turned to baking instead

The 32-year-old said: ‘I have been a bit bored. I’m used to being on the go and active the whole time, and now it’s quite different. So, yes, I’m baking. I love cooking and will definitely cook for the baby.’

And her new culinary interest has been welcomed by her rugby player husband Mike Tindall.

He said: ‘She’s a very good cook and cooks me everything. I cook too, but I’m the pudding guy – sticky toffee puddings, chocolate fondants and brownies.

‘I’m very good at following a recipe whereas Zara’s good at putting her own twist on things.’

Surprise: Zara Phillips and husband Mike Tindall do not want to know the sex of their baby. The couple attended the christening of Prince George of Cambridge last week

Miss Phillips, who won silver at the London Olympics as part of the British three-day eventing team, said she has stopped riding not because she had been criticised for it but because it had become too difficult in the fifth month of her pregnancy.

She said: ‘It’s so uncomfortable. So now I’m just on the ground yelling at everyone.’ But she added that she will back on her horse as soon as possible after the birth.

And her 35-year-old husband revealed the couple don’t want to know the sex of their baby.

Mr Tindall said: ‘We want it to be a surprise. I’m really looking forward to it, but I’m not sure how I’ve prepared. We’ve been pretty relaxed.

‘We’ve not sorted a nursery yet. We have ordered some stuff, but we haven’t gone further than that. 

‘I think we’re both quite well-balanced as a couple, so hopefully he or she will pick up on that. I’m a big kid, so I naturally fit right in.’
