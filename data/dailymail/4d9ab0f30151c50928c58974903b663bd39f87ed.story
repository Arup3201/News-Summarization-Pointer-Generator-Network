The woman accused of shooting a mother outside a clinic and snatching her newborn baby from her arms to raise as her own has spoken for the first time about the horror killing.

Verna McClain, who had recently suffered a miscarriage and told her sister she was planning to adopt a baby, insisted she was not a 'monster'.

The 30-year-old registered nurse said: 'One day, I’m a law abiding citizen, a mother who’s never done anything wrong. The next, I’m a monster.

'Don't judge me': Verna McClain, 30, has spoken out from jail for the first time. She is accused of shooting dead a new mother and snatching her three-day-old child to raise as her own

'I'm nothing like what these people are making me out to be. I’m the same person everybody knows and loves.'

Speaking to KHOU from behind a glass partition, she said: 'Don’t sit and look at me as if I’m some sort of monster. I’m not. Until you know the facts, don’t sit and judge.'

She added: 'Right now, I’m so paranoid I don’t know who to trust. Mentally, I’m borderline.'

McClain has been charged with the first degree murder of Kala Golden Schuchardt.

She is alleged to have shot the 28-year-old mother-of-two and snatched her three-day-old baby Keegan as they left a doctor's office in Spring, Texas.

The newborn baby was found safe with McClain's family after an amber alert had been put out.

Victims: Kala Schuchardt (pictured left with her husband Keith) was shot as she left a clinic where she had taken her son Keegan (right) for a check up. McClain then allegedly stole the baby and sped off

Crime scene: Schuchardt's shoes and bag at the site where she was shot and left screaming, 'My baby!'

Search: An hour after the shooting, police stormed a nearby apartment block after the suspect's car was seen outside. McClain told officers where they could find the unharmed baby boy

Prosecutors said McClain, who has three children other own, had been pregnant with her fiancé’s child. She had been planning to marry in May.

But after she suffered a miscarriage she decided to find another child and convince her fiancé it was his, they said.

McClain's sister also told authorities she had told her she was planning to adopt. She added that once 
McClain had snatched Keegan, she said she had the baby and needed 'to do
the adoption'.

Investigators believe McClain staked out the Northwoods Pediatric Center - where she had taken her own children in the past – looking for a woman with a baby she could kidnap.

Ms Golden walked to her pick-up truck after a check-up with Keegan 
around 2 p.m., when McClain, who was in a 2007 Lexus parked in the adjacent spot, 
starting fighting with her, police said.

'Killer': Prosecutors said McClain, pictured left and right, had suffered a miscarriage and told her sister, centre, that she was going to adopt a baby. After she snatched Keegan, she told her sister she had the child

Fiance: But McClain told Kevin Carter (pictured), who she was due to marry in May, that she had given birth

After shooting the young mother at
close range, McClain allegedly placed the baby in her car and sped off,
hitting Kala as she shrieked 'my baby!' from the ground. She died 
shortly after.

Deputies stormed an apartment block less
than a mile away after the getaway car was seen parked outside. McClain
approached officers and admitted to the killing and kidnapping, police 
said.

McClain told detectives she had taken the boy to a home in northwest 
Harris County. He was found there unharmed six hours after his mother 
had died.

A reporter from KHOU TV was allowed to witness the meeting between McClain and her fiancé Kevin Carter and ask her questions.

Reporter Rucks Russell reported McClain had a 30 minute visit at Montgomery County jail with her fiancé and activist Quanell X.

Mourning: Kala, right, was remembered at her funeral last week. Pictured left, Wilson 'Donnie' Golden sits as a family member comforts her husband Keith Schuchardt and her mother Linda Golden

Service: The family is escorted to the funeral in Willis, Texas. Kala also left behind an older child

Russell said McClain apologised to her fiancée for the trouble she had caused but Kevin Carter said he still planned to marry her.

Shortly after the murder, Montgomery 
County Sheriff's Detective John Schmitt said McClain does 'appear 
remorseful for what happened', the Houston Chronicle reported.

Baby Keegan was reunited with family members, who have been left distraught by the brutal killing.

The baby's father Keith Schuchardt told KHOU after the slaying: '[Kala] was sweet, lovable. I loved her, and she loved me. Everything was going fine until today.'

When asked by reporters what he would tell his wife now, Schuchardt, who had been married to Golden for three years, said: 'I wish you were here with me to get me through this.'

Verna McClain's mother was distraught when she heard of the killing. 'I'm sorry for the family,' she said on KHOU.
