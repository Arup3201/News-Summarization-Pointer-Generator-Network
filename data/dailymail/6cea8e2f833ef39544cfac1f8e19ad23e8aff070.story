The Prius driver at the front of the deadly 4-car pileup that left a woman dead in Malibu on Saturday was operating her vehicle with a suspended license, it was revealed Tuesday.

Hollywood agent Jessica Marie Steindorff, 29, had last lost her license in 2013 for failure to appear and had not yet won it back when she was rear-ended by 69-year-old Kim Howe.

Howe was previously revealed to have been herself driving without a license when she crashed into Steindorff and was in turn rear-ended by Bruce Jenner before a Hummer smashed into her car, leading to the millionaire widow's death.

According to the New York Daily News, Steindorff--whose clients include Victoria's Secret model Alessandra Ambrosio--also had her licensed suspended in 2012 for an 'unsatisfied judgment.'

Steindorff, who has reportedly been cooperative with investigators, told police she'd stopped at behind a line of cars that were sitting at a red when she was rear-ended.

While this cannot be confirmed, police say her story meshes with the traffic tendencies at the Malibu light.

'There were many theories, including the possibility she may have been trying to make a U-turn to get a parking spot, but we have no independent witnesses who've come forward with that information,' law enforcement close to the case told the Daily News.

However, Steindorff's attorney came to her defense late Tuesday, telling the Daily News:

'The story that she was making an illegal u-turn is 100 percent false. She was meeting with a client in Zuma. She has the text messages that prove it,' said attorney Roger Simon, referring to the area west of Malibu.

'She met with detectives today. Nothing looks to be criminal,' Simon said. 'She was a victim.'

Detectives in Malibu continue to work on an investigation into the fatal wreck, with which Jenner is said to be cooperating completely.

He took, and passed, a sobriety test immediately after the crash, and also gave officers a blood sample at a nearby hospital.

Since the crash, Jenner has been seen on the roads again. Monday morning he made a Starbucks run in an inconspicuous Ford Fiesta.

Detectives in Malibu have opened a vehicular homicide investigation in the crash Saturday afternoon on the Pacific Coast Highway, CNN reports. If any of the drivers in the crash if found criminally negligent, felony charges could be filed - which carry a sentence of up to six years in prison.

On Monday, detectives said they are planning to ask Jenner to turn over his cell phone records to show whether he was texting while driving at the time of the crash - an activity that could net a vehicular manslaughter charge under California law, the Los Angeles Times reports. 

The Keeping Up With the Kardashians reality star has vehemently denied he was texting and driving and said he would gladly offer up his cell phone records to move it.

At the time he was driving a $76,000 Escalade ESV, which was hauling a dune buggy.

Jenner, who is in the midst of transitioning from a man to a woman, told police that he was taking a 'very low dosage of hormones that his doctor had prescribed,' a family source told Radar Online.

The very next day, he was spotted out in his Porsche 911 GT3 RS - a 500hp supercar that costs about $185,000.

Pictures from the outing published by the New York Post show Jenner speeding. He was driving at least 56mph in a 50mph zone, according to a digital speed limit sign on the road.

It is unknown why Jenner opted to dramatically downgrade his set of wheels.
