A video of a cat sitting upright while watching a Star Wars movie has become an internet sensation with more than 400,000 hits and 600 comments on YouTube in just three days.

In the video, the cute cat can be seen casually leaning against a sofa while wagging its tail, fully engrossed in the action that is unfolding before it.

At times, the playful pet looks alert and sits bolt upright, leaning in to the television screen, while, at others, it slumps back and enjoys the movie.
