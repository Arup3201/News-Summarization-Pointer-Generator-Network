A man was last night arrested on suspicion of murder after a 20-year-old man was stabbed to death.

Andrew Lucas was found in a stairwell near his flat on Warkworth Close in Washington, Tyne and Wear, by police and ambulance crews at 3:40am yesterday, leaving the local community shocked.

He suffered various injuries and was taken to hospital but pronounced dead. Northumbria Police detectives are holding the 45-year-old man in custody as inquiries continue in their murder probe.

Forensic officers were quickly on the 
scene yesterday, with one taking pictures while another gathered 
material after a search of the area, which is 10 miles south of 
Newcastle upon Tyne.

Patrols have been stepped up in Washington following the incident and any concerned residents have been told 
to speak to their neighbourhood policing team, officers said.

Detective Chief Inspector Christina 
Barrett, who is leading the investigation, said the force is still 
asking for people with information about the offence to come forward.

She added: ‘The investigation is ongoing, however we have nothing to suggest that there is any wider danger to the public.’

Jamie Nolan, 20, who lives on the 
same road, told the Sunday Sun: 'We were out until about 4.30am and we 
came back and we saw an ambulance down by the flats.

'It is tragic, he was just a young lad. We are 
all just gobsmacked'

'We are all just shocked that this has
happened in the street. It is tragic, he was just a young lad. We are 
all just gobsmacked.'

Another resident said: 'It is so tragic, that poor lad. I cannot imagine how his family must feel.'

Mr Lucas's family, from nearby Hebburn, were said to be too distressed to talk about their loss.
