A toddler shows off her belly button in an adorable and innocent photograph that her family loved so much they chose to share it with friends.

But after Marlow’s mother uploaded it on photo-sharing website Instagram she was shocked when her account was deactivated because it was deemed inappropriate.

Courtney Adamo, 33, was sent an email by Instagram saying the image ‘violated the community guidelines’.

Banned: Mother-of-four Courtney Adamo had her Instagram account shut down after posting this picture of her 19-month-old daughter Marlow

Strict policy: The blogger (pictured with her daughter Marlow) from Hampstead, north London, was told that she was 'violating community guidelines' by uploading the picture

The social media company removed the photo and also deleted a picture of 19-month-old  Marlow at the beach with her father.

Confused, Mrs Adamo re-read the Facebook-owned firm’s guidelines and was convinced she had not broken any rules. So she reposted the photo to the 40,000 people who ‘follow’ her on Instagram.

The mother of four, who runs an online boutique, said: ‘They said I violated their guidelines, which are very vague.

Frustrated: Mrs Adamo, pictured with her two sons, two daughters and husband Adam (right) said the measure was 'crazy. Yesterday the Instagram account was up and running again, but the photo of Marlow is still banned

‘Their guidelines say things like “no pornographic material”. So I thought, “That photo hasn’t violated anything”. I put it back up and that’s when my account was shut down.

‘So it turns out that photo does violate their terms and conditions because any female child of walking age or older cannot appear shirtless, according to Instagram.’ American-born Mrs Adamo, who is married to an animation company boss and lives in Highgate, North London, said she posted the two photos for her family who live across the Atlantic.

‘It’s ridiculous,’ she added. ‘If you look at mainstream companies that put out advertisements on national television you’ll see toddlers her age wearing just a nappy.

‘I believe I’ve only put up wholesome photos and I think my children will look back on them with fond memories.’

Don’t share photos or videos that aren’t yours.

Don’t share photos or videos that show nudity or mature content.

Don’t share photos or videos of illegal content.Don’t spam.

Don’t be rude.

Don't promote or glorify self-harm.

Last night Instagram reinstated Mrs Adamo’s account, but the two photos of Marlow  are still banned.

Mrs Adamo, who is also a mother to Easton, nine, Quin, seven and five-year-old Ivy, said she will be more careful about what she posts in future as she is worried about her photos being deleted.

She said: ‘It’s the people that are making a fuss and sexualising it whose mindset you have to question.’

Instagram said: ‘We try hard to find a good balance between allowing people to express themselves creatively and having policies in place to protect young children.’

Clear-cut: Her account has now been reinstated, but the photo is still banned. She believes the site should make its policies clearer

Guidelines: The photo, however, has not been taken down by Facebook, who share similar policies
