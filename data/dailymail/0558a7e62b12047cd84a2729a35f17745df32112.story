A teenager who was caught on camera repeatedly punching a dog in the face and kicking a cat in a series of brutal attacks was only handed a rehabilitation order in court today.

In shocking video footage, which was filmed at a house in Luton, Bedfordshire, in September last year, the 16-year-old can be seen punching a terrified Staffordshire Bull terrier in the face.

In another video the youth, who cannot be named for legal reasons, can be seen kicking a cat in the head.

The 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has been banned from keeping animals for life after carrying out the unprovoked attacks on the innocent pets

The dog, called Tyler, was left with a bleeding eye after being subjected to the attack during which it was held down by the neck

The teenager pleaded guilty to two 
counts of causing unnecessary suffering to animals under the Animal 
Welfare Act when he appeared at Luton Magistrates’ Court today.

Despite his horrific crimes, he was handed just an 18-month Youth Rehabilitation Order, including a 
three-month daily curfew from 7pm to 7am.

He was also banned from keeping 
any animals for the rest of his life.

Video footage of the teenager abusing 
animals emerged after police officers, who were investigating 
another matter, found video clips on his mobile phone and passed it onto
 the RSCPA.

The youth had saved one of the horrific attacks under a file name of ‘LOL’, slang speak for ‘laugh out loud’.

In the first video the violent teen puts the dog, called Tyler, in a chair. He then punches it in the head and stomach before kneeing it in the face.

A vet said the dog is likely to have suffered extreme distress and bruising, as well as soft tissue trauma and damage to the ribs, facial nerves and trachea in the horrific attack

The teenager pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to animals when he appeared at Luton Magistrates' Court

The dog was left with a bleeding eye after being subjected to the attack - during which it was held down by the neck.

A
 vet said the dog is also likely to have suffered extreme distress and 
bruising, as well as soft tissue trauma and damage to the ribs, facial 
nerves and trachea in the horrific attack.

In another video, filmed in April last year, the youth can be seen forcefully kicking a tortoiseshell cat in the head.

A
 vet said the distressed cat would have suffered bruising and soft 
tissue trauma, as well as possible physical trauma to the pelvis and 
bladder.

RSPCA inspector Stephanie Law said both of the distressing attacks were ‘utterly abhorrent’.

She said: ‘I have seen a lot of horrible things in my job, but I felt physically ill watching this footage, it was so distressing.

‘I just couldn’t help flinching each time each one of these animals was so brutally attacked.

He saved this footage of him kicking a cat in the head under the file name of 'LOL' - 'laugh out loud' - on his mobile phone

‘What makes it even worse is that he seems to have seen this gratuitous violence as some form of entertainment.

‘Not only did he film it on his phone, but saved it under the title “LOL”.

‘Thank goodness a lifetime disqualification was put in place to prevent other animals from suffering a similar fate.’

The Staffordshire bull terrier and tortoiseshell cat have both since been re-homed and have made a good recovery.
