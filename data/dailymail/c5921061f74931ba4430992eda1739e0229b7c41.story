Exercise can vastly improve the lives of osteoarthritis sufferers, health chiefs said yesterday.

Too many patients believe nothing they do will lessen their discomfort, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.

The institute insists that physical exertion can help the condition and ease pain.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has today said exercise should be the principal treatment for those diagnosed with osteoarthritis

Around 8.5million people in the UK have osteoarthritis, which causes joint pain and stiffness.

Issuing its new guidance, Nice says exercise should be the principal treatment. ‘There’s a common but mistaken belief that osteoarthritis is an inevitable part of ageing and that it will get worse – that’s not the case,’ said Professor Mark Baker, clinical practice chief at Nice.

‘The guidance highlights that the core treatment for osteoarthritis remains exercise – this not only helps relieve pain for some but also improves function.’

Nice also called for GPs to refer patients to surgeons for possible joint replacements before they became incapacitated – rather than it being a last line of treatment.

The new advice warns doctors that a patient’s age, sex, smoking history or whether they are obese should not be barriers to referral for joint surgery.

Osteoarthritis should not be considered an 'inevitable part of ageing that will only get worse', say Nice

Professor Karen Middleton, of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said: ‘These guidelines should help challenge the perception that many people often have about osteoarthritis being a normal part of ageing and that nothing can be done.

‘Physiotherapists provide effective treatment for the symptoms of osteoarthritis and deliver expert advice on physical activity and weight-management strategies to reduce pain and improve mobility.

'Nice has recognised how important this is for the day-to-day management of the condition and the positive impact it has on patients' quality of life.'

Judi Rhys of Arthritis Care said the charity's experts were 'firm believers in the value of appropriate exercise for people with osteoarthritis'.

Nice said overweight patients should be encouraged to lose weight while drugs such as paracetamol and ibuprofen gel should be considered for pain relief.

Professor Alan Silman,  of Arthritis Research UK, said: 'It's important that people with osteoarthritis find a type of exercise they enjoy doing.

'Everyone can benefit from some sort of exercise, regardless of their condition.

'Stretching. strengthening and aerobic exercises are the ideal combination.'
