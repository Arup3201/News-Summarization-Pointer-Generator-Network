The attacker who cut off a father’s penis could have targeted the wrong man, it was claimed today.

Father-of-seven Kelvin 'Kelly' Hewitt, 40, was found blood-soaked last Thursday beside the A66 near Middlesbrough, and was taken to hospital where he was put into a medically-induced coma.

The construction worker was reportedly attacked in a caravan where he was staying - but a friend said today that he was not a traveller and suggested the attacker ‘was looking for someone else’.

Attack: Kelvin 'Kelly' Hewitt (left and right) is the father-of-seven who had his penis cut off near Middlesbrough

Scene: He was reportedly attacked in a caravan where he was staying at a campsite near Middlesbrough

The friend, who has not been named, 
told the Daily Mirror: ‘He has a big family in the area, and it has 
shocked everyone who knows him. He is no villain.

‘You
 wonder if he was in the wrong place, at the wrong time, and whoever did
 this was looking for someone else. We can see no reason for anyone 
having a go at him like this.

‘It does not bear thinking about - did they get the wrong man, and do this to him?’

Mr
 Hewitt had only recently moved to the South Bank travellers site after 
being forced to relocate from another camp nearby, reported the Daily 
Mirror.

Pain: Mr Hewitt (left, kissing an unknown woman) has regained consciousness after being put into a coma

Possible connection: The man was attacked near a gipsy campsite on John Boyle Road on Teesside

Standstill: Police closed a busy dual carriageway in the North-East last week to hunt for the man's penis

His former partner 
Debbie Lewis, mother of four of his children, was ‘devastated’. She 
said: ‘I have had two of them upstairs in their rooms in tears since all
 this came out.’

'It does not bear thinking about - did they get the wrong man, and do this to him?'

Friend of Kelvin Hewitt

Last week 
it was revealed that Mr Hewitt has fathered at least seven children by 
three different women. He has regained consciousness but is still in too
 much pain to be interviewed by police.

Officers
 from Cleveland Police closed part of the dual carriageway on Friday to 
search for the missing manhood, but have not been able to find it.

Mr
 Hewitt is thought to be in a relationship with Carla Hill, who is a 
mother to two of his children, and has four more children with Miss 
Lewis.

Distressed: The 40-year-old was discovered in a distressed state on the side of the A66 dual carriageway

A 22-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assault in relation to the incident and was released on bail

Leanne Trewitt, 22, 
another of Hewitt's children from a third partner, posted on Facebook 
last week: 'My dad's stable now - just hoping for a speedy recovery. 
Love you Papa Smurf!'

Her friends flooded her page with get-well messages after she posted the above note.

A
 Cleveland Police spokesman said: 'The victim remains in 
hospital and is now conscious. Officers visited him today (Saturday) but
 were unable to carry out a detailed interview.

'They hope to speak to him today or tomorrow to establish exactly how his injuries were sustained. Inquiries are on-going.'

Officers search the verge of the dual carriageway for the man's organ and other forensic evidence

Last week it was revealed that Mr Hewitt has fathered at least seven children by three different women

Mr
 Hewitt was discovered in a distressed state on the side of the A66 dual
 carriageway. The builder, originally from Redcar, moved on to the 
Heaven Traveller's Site at South Bank about six years ago.

Despite regaining consciousness Mr Hewitt faces a long period of recovery and will need extensive plastic surgery.

Dr
 Raj Persad, a consultant urologist, told MailOnline that a new penis 
could be constructed even if the original tissue is lost.

He
 said: 'The best hope is that doctors have kept the tissue in a viable 
way so the penis can be reconnected. If the tissue is no longer viable, 
the options are limited.

Road block: This stretch of the A66 near Middlesbrough was sealed off by police investigating the incident

Ambulance: Mr Hewitt was found at 4.50am with serious injuries and was taken to hospital

Investigation: Officers were said to be 'keeping an open mind' as to how the man was injured

Missing: It is understood that his penis had been cut off and was missing, prompting officers to close sections of the route in order to search for it

'It
 may be possible to make a phallus – rather like that created in gender 
reassignment surgery.

'Here, tissue expanders can be used to create a 
flap of tissue that can be rolled into a phallus. The urethra would also
 have to be reconstructed.'

A
 22-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assault in relation to the
 incident and held in police custody on Thursday. He was later bailed 
pending further enquiries.

Mr Hewitt was found at 4.50am and was taken to James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough.
