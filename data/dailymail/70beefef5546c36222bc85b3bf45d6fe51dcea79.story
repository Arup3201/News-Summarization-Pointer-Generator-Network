They call them iceberg homes because so much is hidden beneath the surface – and they are proving VERY controversial.

In London, where property prices keep rising and space is  at a premium, ever more people are deciding to expand their homes downwards, creating vast basements – and in may cases a great deal of upset among the neighbours.

Tetra Pak heir Hans Rausing is one of the latest members of the capital’s super-rich  to join the iceberg trend, planning a double basement complete with underground pool, car park and gym.

Those living close to such developments often complain of the noise and vibration created – and object to the road closures frequently required while excavated material is removed form the site. There are also concerns about the effect that digging so deep can have on the water table.

Ersin Sirer is one of those who has successfully navigated the problems of creating an iceberg home, recently completing a basement extension in a mews house in South Kensington, West London, that is now for sale for £5.95 million.

Ersin, 50, has long-standing links with the area. Besides his work as a property developer, he owns Chelsea breakfast haunt The Chelsea Bun, where celebrities such as Kylie Minogue, Minnie Driver, Sienna Miller  and Bob Geldof are regularly seen sipping coffee.

In fact, his family have been well known around South Kensington ever since his father, Resat, launched the Bosphorus Kebab Inn on Old Brompton Road in 1973.

This was the first kebab house to open in the capital outside the Turkish community in North London and is still there today, under the same ownership, keeping late-night revellers’ appetites satisfied.

Ersin, who is married with  a two-year-old daughter, can’t be charged with running roughshod over his neighbours’ concerns when he developed his iceberg home, despite the fact he dug 23ft down to create two underground storeys comprising 1,130 sq ft.

When he made the planning application for the development, the only objection he received was from a neighbour who wasn’t concerned by the subterranean digging – she just insisted the garage wasn’t used as a living area, which he was happy to comply with.

Ersin says his application was helped by the fact that another nearby resident had recently carried out a major basement development.

The development did not come cheap. He
spent £35,000 on simply renting two parking spaces at the rear of the 
house for vehicles to remove the excavated matter from under the house.

On top of that, he had to seal the basement storeys with a silicon 
membrane and fit a pump to deal with excess levels of water rising from 
beneath the house.

‘I could 
have gone down further,’ says  Ersin, ‘as I encountered fewer problems 
than other developers building basement extensions – largely because it 
is a mews house with direct access to roads on either side, which is 
very rare.’

Ersin, who bought the house from an offshore company that had used it as a rental property, spent a large sum on the renovation, but the result of digging two new storeys is that a modest mews house has been transformed into a modern palace.

‘The main challenge was getting 
natural light in all the storeys,’ he says. ‘This was helped by the fact
that there are windows on both sides and I have created an open-plan 
effect with skylights and glass partitions throughout, which means 
sunlight reaches the bottom floor.

‘I like square rooms and the overall feel of the property is warm, cosy yet chic.’

The
house now has four bedrooms, three with en suite bathrooms. There is 
also a shower room and a utility room and an abundance of entertaining 
space – a ground-floor reception, a dining room, a further reception 
room, and a media room with bar and wine cellar on the lower basement, 
plus a large garage.

Simon Rose, of selling agents Strutt and Parker, believes the underground development will make the house attractive to a range of potential buyers. ‘What is extraordinary about this house is that it offers a true alternative to the typical townhouse style,’ says Rose.

He says the house is finished to a luxury standard and believes that the probable buyer is already looking or living in the Knightsbridge, Belgravia or Mayfair areas.

‘Properties with such width are rare, and this mews in particular is positioned in a very quiet and discreet position and would suit buyers looking for good security and discretion. This particular package is very hard to find in South Kensington.’

Whoever buys the house, regulars at the Chelsea Bun can be reassured that Ersin has no plans to allow his property developing sideline to take him away from in his catering work – thus ensuring that a great tradition that began with his kebab-selling father in the 1970s continues.
