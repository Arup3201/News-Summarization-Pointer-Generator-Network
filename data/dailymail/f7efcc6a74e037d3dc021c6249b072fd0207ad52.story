A Sydney drag racer has made an incredible escape from a burning inferno after his race car mechanics malfunctioned and he hurtled into a wall at more than 250km/h.

Wetherill Park pizza maker Frank "MrHeli" Cannistra was competing in an Australian Pro Street Association meet at Sydney Dragway on Saturday when the throttle in his car gave way.

The 39-year-old recounted the moment, just a second after crossing the finish line of the quarter-mile straight, made the split decision to career head-on into the safety wall which sent his car up in a ball of flames.

Instead of threatening the safety of his rival, who was ahead of Cannistra, he made the decision to hurtling at top speed into the wall.

'The car was on fire (with its performance), then literally on fire,' he told Wide World of Sports.

'The initial contact I thought I was going to get hurt and when the fire came I really panicked.'

Incredibly, the 39-year-old unbuckled his seat belt on impact in anticipation of a quick escape.

He said if it wasn't for the makeup of the car and  the ease at which he could release the door, he would have been trapped inside.

'I came out of it without a scratch.'

But the lightweight souped-up Mazda RX3 was a wreck following the ordeal which lasted just 20 seconds from start to finish.

Not for the faint-hearted, drag racing can reach forces of up to 6g's and top speeds variate between 200-300km/hr at top speeds.

On the weekend Cannista said he reached 230km/hr in under five seconds.

Cannistra, who runs a mobile pizzeria called Franco's Mobile Pizzeria, has been racing for 20 years and pays for his 'hobby' with his pizza sales, along with some sponsors.
