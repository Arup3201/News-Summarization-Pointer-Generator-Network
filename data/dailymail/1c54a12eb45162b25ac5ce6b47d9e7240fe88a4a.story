Spain are one of my favourites to win the World Cup, but I fear they’ll suffer from fatigue.

The players have been competing at the highest level in Europe — to the end of the Champions League, the Europa League and the Spanish League, which went to the wire with Atletico Madrid, Barcelona and Real Madrid.

The players are exhausted and repeating those performance levels against the best players in the world will not be easy. Most of their build-up has been about recuperation and repair.

Running out of steam? Spain's players might be tired after a gruelling season for their club sides

Holland’s coach Louis van Gaal has already stated his intent by declaring Spain’s quality is such that he will have to play with five across the back. Spain will need a more concentrated effort to break through and guard against Van Gaal’s counter-attack plans.

Some critics have questioned whether Spain are ageing, or on the wane, but I don’t see that at all. My friend Vicente Del Bosque has a squad that knows Spain’s system. It means that, even if Xavi or Andres Iniesta grow tired, the likes of David Silva or Juan Mata know exactly what is required.

I have the feeling that Silva, as he has already shown in Manchester City’s colours, could be key to opening up more than one tight defence. I see Spain and Brazil as the favourites, but it is difficult not to consider Argentina, especially in South America.

And, if they click, Belgium — who have a lot of very talented players — will be the dark horses.
