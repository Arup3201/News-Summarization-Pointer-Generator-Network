The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of same sex marriage by striking down the Defense of Marriage Act in a landmark 5-4 decision this morning.

It followed that decision with a ruling against California's controversial Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in the state, meaning that gay marriage will inevitably be deemed legal in California.

By striking down DOMA, the Supreme Court ruled that it was not legal to prevent same-sex spouses from receiving the same benefits that heterosexual couples receive.

Just minutes after their ruling against the Defense of Marriage Act was announced, the Supreme Court declared California's Proposition 8 unconstitutional.

The legal drama in California came when the state approved same-sex marriage, and that was followed months later with a Prop 8, which was put in place by the 9th Circuit Court.

Prop 8 banned same-sex marriage across the state, and today, the Supreme Court ruled that the 9th Circuit Court was overstepping their bounds by putting the ban in place in the first place.

Though the legal wrangling will undoubtedly continue in the coming months, the ruling suggests that California will go back to allowing same-sex marriage.

If that is the case, it will be the 13th state to legally allow same-sex marriage.

The plaintiffs in the Prop 8 case were two same-sex couples from California. During their celebratory interviews on the steps of the Supreme Court, one of the women received a phone call from President Obama  personally congratulating them on their victory.

While it does not theoretically change the fact that only 12 states and the District of Columbia are the only areas in the U.S. where same-sex marriages are granted, today's ruling means that any couples who are married in those states have to be treated the same as any heterosexual married couples under the law across the country.

The broadly-written decision says among other privileges, same-sex couples can now file joint tax returns, are entitled to social security survivor benefits, have the right to make medical decisions for incapacitated partners, and will receive notification when a spouse is killed in action. 

Justice Anthony
 Kennedy wrote the majority decision, saying that it was not legal to 
consider same-sex marriages anything lesser than full legal 
partnerships.

'Under DOMA, 
same-sex married couples have their lives burdened, by reason of 
government decree, in visible and public ways,' Justice Kennedy wrote in
 the majority decision.

'DOMA's principal effect is to identify a subset of state-sanctioned marriages and make them unequal.'

He
 wrote that the previous law caused 'a stigma upon all who enter into 
same-sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of the 
states.'

As was 
expected, the court's four more conservative justices- Samuel Alito, 
Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and chief justice John Roberts- voted 
against the issue. 

President Obama is currently in 
Africa on a state visit to Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania, but he 
tweeted shortly after the decision was reached. 

Big day: The ruling over the Defense of Marriage Act was one of the most hotly-anticipated verdicts

Celebrating: Glennda Testone of The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Center jumps for joy after the Defense of Marriage Act was struck down, meaning that same-sex partners will receive equal benefits

'Today's DOMA ruling is a historic step forward for #MarriageEquality #LoveIsLove,' his official Twitter account released.

He was expected to make a statement about the two rulings, and his words 
will have an added twist as he will give them in Senegal, where 
homosexuality is illegal.

The second ruling of the day came on 
the issue of Proposition 8. In that case, California had passed same-sex
 marriage but then Prop 8 was put in place banning gay marriage in the 
state. Today's Supreme Court decision said that Prop 8 was not legal, 
and they were not legally able to put that ban into place.

By removing the ban, California is now the 13th state that allows same-sex marriage.

The
 landmark decision comes on a busy week for the highest court in the 
land, as they already handed down verdicts on similarly controversial 
decisions on affirmative action, the voting rights act, and a custody 
battle between a girl's Native American biological father and her 
adoptive family.

Crowds gathered outside of the court on Wednesday morning ahead of their 10am announcement.

Waiting to hear: The court was ruling on two different cases that would decide whether gay couples are legally allowed to marry across the country

Right now, 12 states and the District of Columbia recognize same-sex marriages as legal, and it is likely that the issue will still continue to be determined on a state-by-state basis.

The case itself was based around the constitutionality of denying spousal benefits to same sex partners.They are also considering the validity of the California ban on same-sex marriage.

Named the United States v. Windsor, the case was filed by an elderly lesbian named Edith Windsor. She was married to her female spouse Thea Spyer but was denied estate tax when Ms Spyer died.

Their 40-year love story has been a well-publicized one and a movie was made to nationalize.

In light of today's landmark ruling, Windsor no longer has to pay the IRS hundreds of dollars that she was told to pay because the federal government did not recognize her same-sex marriage as valid.

Edie Windsor thanked her friends and attorneys at a press conference after the ruling

Edie Windsor challenged the federal Defense of Marriage Act after she was made to pay $363,000 in inheritance taxes, after her partner of 44 years Thea Spyer died. A heterosexual would not have faced the punitive bill.

She seemed hopeful after she testified in front of the court in March, and today she is undoubtedly celebrating.

'They were direct, they asked all the right questions,' she said after exiting the hearing in late March.

'I didn't feel any hostility or any sense of inferiority...I felt we were very respected and I think it's gonna be good,' she added with a smile.

Two years after they were married, Spyer, a long-suffering multiple sclerosis patient, passed away.

Windsor explained how weeks later she suffered a real life 'broken heart,' when she was struck down with a heart-attack. She was then hit with the massive tax bill.

'In the midst of my grief, I realized the federal government was treating us as strangers,' she said.

As such, the widow challenged the DOMA and when lower courts agreed that the Act discriminatory and unconstitutional, the case was handed to the Supreme Court to make a final determination.

The 1996 U.S. law denies married same-sex couples access to federal benefits by defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Kennedy referred to DOMA as "inconsistent" because it purports to give authority to the states to define marriage while limiting recognition of those determinations.                                                                                                   -Daily Mail Reporter
