Forecasters have issued a ‘Level Two’ warning which means unusually hot weather  is expected to last for at least two days running, with temperatures staying as high as  15C (59F) overnight.

The alert, which is the third most serious warning, means there is a high chance that  temperatures could pose significant health risks such as dehydration, heat-stroke and severe sunburn.

Met Office forecaster Helen Waite said: ‘A Level Two warning means a heatwave is on the cards so we just ask the public to take care and be aware of the hot weather.’

High temperatures are expected between
midday on Friday and 8pm on Sunday,  and if they continue, a Level 
Three warning, which constitutes an actual heatwave, could be issued.

The hottest regions are expected to be the East Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber regions during Friday and Saturday.

Forecasters say York and Newcastle could see temperatures of 30C (86F) on Friday.

On Sunday temperatures will be higher in the East, South East, London and parts of the South West.

The outlook for the rest of July remains mostly positive for the south of England, with dry  and sunny conditions predicted until August.

It is a welcome change after the coldest spring in more than five decades, while last year was the second wettest on record.
