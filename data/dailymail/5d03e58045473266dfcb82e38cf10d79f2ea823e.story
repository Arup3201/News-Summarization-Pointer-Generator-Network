These horrific images show two eighth-grade students brawling in a school bathroom while a group of girls stand nearby to cheer them on.

The family of a 13-year-old girl pummelled in the video are outraged and  want action from Ludington Magnet Middle School in Detroit, Michigan.

The girls are taking part in a ‘30 Seconds game’ where one pupil punches another while they are recorded and timed by a group standing nearby.

Shocking: The family of a 13-year-old girl pummelled in the video are outraged and want action from Ludington Magnet Middle School in Detroit

Horrific: The girls are involved in a game called '30 Seconds' where one pupil punches another while they are taped and timed by a group standing nearby

‘This happened during school at eight o'clock in the morning,’ said Arletha Newby, the sister of the beaten girl Jasmine Crawley.

‘Where was security, the staff, teachers?’ she told WJBK Fox 2 Detriot. ‘You do not notice that 15 of your kids are gone out of a classroom?’

Jasmine walked away with just broken glasses and scratches, but claims she was pressured into the fight and other pupils made fun of her loss.

Ms Newby said Jasmine has been bullied for talking about the violence and someone posted on her Facebook wall: ‘Snitches get stitches’.

Jasmine's aunt Felisia Newby said she knows her niece is ‘not an angel’ but wants to ensure schools are being ‘diligent’ about the fighting.

‘I think right now we just need to be pre-emptive with having a solution,’ she said. The family said they are worried about serious injury.

A Detroit Public Schools spokesman told WJBK the school will follow up what happened and look at disciplinary action.

Ludington has 380 students - 60 per cent female, 99 per cent black or African American and 72 per cent receiving free or reduced school meals.
