Motor racing’s governing body, the FIA, are hoping to trial ‘speed limits’ at the next race in Austin, Texas, as they seek to improve safety after the horrific crash that has left Marussia’s Jules Bianchi fighting for his life.

Bianchi veered off at the Japanese Grand Prix last week, despite double yellow flags being waved to slow him down. He hit a recovery vehicle and was taken to hospital for emergency brain surgery.

Race director Charlie Whiting presented a report on the accident to FIA president Jean Todt this weekend.

Imposing a speed limit under yellow and double yellow flags is a suggestion that is expected to be tried out in practice at Texas in three weeks’ time. 

Lewis Hamilton said: ‘We had a drivers’ meeting with Jean Todt. One of the ideas that came out was based on when you go karting with electric karts. When the flags come out the engines are limited.

‘I think that’s quite good. What’s good is they are reacting to it and finding the best solution.’
