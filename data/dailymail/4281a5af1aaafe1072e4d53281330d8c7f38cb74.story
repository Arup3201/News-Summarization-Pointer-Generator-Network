Warning: General Sir Peter Wall has warned against any further defence cuts after the next election

Britain should not make any further cuts to its Army after the next election, its chief argues today.

In an attempt to draw a line under cost-savings, General Sir Peter Wall says most of the change is ‘now behind us’.

The Chief of the General Staff says that after such ‘significant changes’ he is confident the Army’s new slimmed down structure ‘will endure’.

Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Sir Peter lobbies against even deeper cuts in next year’s defence spending review.

Defence chiefs fear that spending may fall below the two per cent of GDP that Britain has pledged to its Nato allies.

Sir Peter stresses that Britain still needs ‘well-trained, well-equipped units with committed soldiers ready to deploy at short notice, who can adapt quickly and intelligently to unforeseen situations’.

A strong Army is needed to give the government ‘genuine choices in a crisis’, he adds.

The 2010 defence review will lead to the loss of 20,000 regular soldiers by the end of the decade as eight per cent of the Ministry of Defence budget is cut. The Navy will lose 6,000 sailors and the RAF 8,000 airmen.

Sir Peter’s intervention comes as a former head of the Royal Navy yesterday said the Government’s cuts to its fleet have gone too far and are a ‘national disgrace’.

Lord West of Spithead, a former first sea lord, said yesterday the coalition had not just cut to the bone but ‘into the bone’, as he insisted the UK had been left with too few ships to escort naval convoys.

The Labour peer also warned the possibility of Scottish independence poses the greatest security and defence threat to the UK.

Asked about the scale of today’s navy, Lord West told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘I believe we’ve cut into the bone... it’s not to the bone, but into the bone and I think we’ve gone too far.'

He added: ‘A great maritime nation like us, where we still run global shipping from London and we’re totally reliant on that, those sinews that keep the global village together, to have 19 escorts I think is a national disgrace actually.

‘And I think we really do need to think very, very hard about that because we have a very dangerous and chaotic world.

‘If you look at the LNG (liquefied natural gas) carriers, every 20 hours from Qatar to Milford Haven there is an LNG carrier - 13% of our gas supplies in this country.

‘If you stop that we suddenly have not got any power and that’s just that. There’s the same for food and all these other things.’

Turning to the possibility of Scottish independence, Lord West said: ‘The greatest grand strategic threat to the security and defence of our islands is the possibility of Scotland separating.

‘This is a really, really serious issue. There is no doubt whatsoever that if Scotland separated it would diminish our ability to defend these islands.’

He added he did not blame anyone for this situation potentially emerging.
