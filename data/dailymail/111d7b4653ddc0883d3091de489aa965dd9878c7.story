Two men convicted of plotting to murder singer Joss Stone, 27, have had their sentences cut after a legal challenge

Two men convicted of plotting to rob and kill international pop star Joss Stone have had their jail terms cut after winning an appeal against the length of their sentences.

Junior Bradshaw, 33, had his 18-year sentence cut to ten years by three Court of Appeal judges in London, while Kevin Liverpool, 36, who was originally given life with a minimum term of ten years and eight months, had his minimum reduced to six-and-a-half years.

As a result, Bradshaw, who with Liverpool was found guilty of conspiring to murder the 27-year-old singer last year, could be free in as little as five years' time.

The pair, of Longsight, Manchester, were convicted of conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to rob following a three-week trial at Exeter Crown Court.

They drove from Manchester to Miss Stone’s home in mid-Devon with an arsenal of weapons to rob and kill her.

When the pair were sentenced, Judge Francis Gilbert, the Recorder of Exeter, branded Liverpool a danger to the public, and said he targeted Miss Stone to get more than £1million from her.

He told him: 'You intended to rob her and kill her and dump her body in the river, according to your words, and then leave the country with your accomplice, Junior Bradshaw.

'You had no reason to target her except that she was a wealthy young woman as she was a successful singer.'

Liverpool and Bradshaw had scouted Miss Stone’s home and were on their way to attack her armed with a sword, three knives, two hammers, masks, gloves and a hosepipe when they were arrested in Cullompton in June 2011.

Suspicious residents had called the police, having spotted their badly-damaged Fiat Punto in the area.

The pair told police they were lost and were trying to get to Bristol, but officers became wary and discovered the weapons in the boot.

Giving the ruling of the court, Mr Justice Bean said Liverpool’s appealed life sentence still held.

Lawyers for the pair had argued that their 'clumsy and badly-planned' conspiracy was not serious enough to qualify Liverpool for a life sentence.

But the judges rejected this, saying Liverpool's life sentence 'was justified', and that he 'poses a high risk of serious harm to the public'.

Taking into account the 22 months spent in custody before sentencing, Liverpool now becomes eligible to apply for parole in December 2017, but the judges stressed that 'we are not ordering that the appellant be released in December 2017'.

Mr Justice Bean said: 'Far from it. The significance of the minimum term is that it specifies that the Parole Board will only be able to consider for the first time in late 2017 whether the appellant can safely be released.'

'The purpose and effect of a sentence of life imprisonment is that if it is never considered safe for the offender to be released, he may remain detained for life, and that if he is ever released it can only be on licence and subject to supervision.'

Bradshaw, who was described as the 'foot soldier' to Liverpool's 'instigator', was 'of exceptionally low intellectual capacity', the judge said.

Mr Justice Bean said that had Bradshaw been more intelligent, 'he would have realised that the chances of a successful and profitable robbery were so remote as not to be worth attempting'.

The judge said the decision to reduce Bradshaw's sentence was taken in the light of Liverpool's reduced sentence.

A spokesman for Miss Stone said the singer declined to comment.
