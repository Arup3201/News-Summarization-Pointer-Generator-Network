Everton's players put their disappointing 3-0 defeat at Southampton on Saturday behind them to spread some festive cheer at Alder Hey children's hospital on Monday afternoon.

Manager Roberto Martinez led his squad on their annual visit to the Liverpool-based hospital, with first-team stars including Leighton Baines, Phil Jagielka and Kevin Mirallas in attendance.

Players handed out Everton gifts to patients including cuddly toys, blankets, cushions, colouring sets and footballs, while wishing families well for the Christmas period.

Speaking to Everton's website, Martinez said: 'To see the young patients having such a big smile is fantastic. It is a very special day.

'The players are incredible ambassadors of Everton and are well aware of what they represent in their community. They like coming here to share moments and stories and to see the spirit everyone has.

'It also makes you realise what a great job everyone at Alder Hey does and you want to spend as much time as possible with everyone. It's fascinating to see how everyone gives everything they've got to help other people.

'We know they go through difficult moments and the commitment they show makes you proud of the people who work here.'

Everton's players gave out a variety of Christmas gifts including cuddly toys and footballs on Monday

Alder Hey, which has links to the Toffees and the club's Everton in the Community charity, cares for more than 270,000 children every year.

Defender John Stones added: 'It's lovely to come here and put a smile on the kids' faces. It's not the nicest place to be at Christmas and it's our job to come and give them a bit of joy for however long we're here, see the kids, the families and give them a little present.

'The kids are so strong, they just get on with it, so it's a real eye opener.

'It's a perk of being a footballer to be able to bring that joy and we always do our best to make it a special day.'

Sylvain Distin and Arouna Kone also made a visit to Claire House hospice in Wirral.
