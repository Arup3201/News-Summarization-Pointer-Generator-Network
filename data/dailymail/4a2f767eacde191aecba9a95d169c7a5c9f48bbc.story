Children with genetic material from three parents could be born from next year, after MPs voted to legalise the controversial technique.

In a highly-charged debate yesterday, critics warned there was ‘no going back’ from allowing a couple to use an egg donor’s DNA to prevent genetic disease.

But MPs voted by 382 to 128 for the procedure after hearing it could be the ‘light at the end of a very dark tunnel’ for families blighted by incurable conditions.

These diseases, such as muscular dystrophy, affect one in 6,500 and are passed down in the mother’s mitochondria, the ‘batteries’ that power the body’s cells.

British scientists devised the new IVF technique, in which the child has genetic material from three people, but does not inherit any of the donor’s characteristics.

The UK would be the first country to legalise the procedure.

Opponents include the Church of England, Catholic Church, Human Genetics Alert, Christian Medical Fellowship, Society for the Protection of Unborn Children and Islamic Medical Association UK.

They say permanently altering a person’s genetic make-up has huge ethical consequences and raises concerns about a slippery slope to designer babies.

But supporters, including the Prime Minister, said it will give couples who have endured repeatedly miscarrying, or burying their children, the option of a healthy family.

David Cameron said: ‘As someone who has had the experience of having a severely disabled child [Ivan, who died six years ago] I have every sympathy with those parents.

'The people arguing that we are fiddling with nature in a profound way, I think are quite wrong. We are not playing God, we are just making sure that all parents who want a healthy baby can have one.’

The House of Lords is expected to back the change later this month. 

Applications would then have to be approved by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, but it is expected the first child could be born using the technique by the end of 2016.

Many MPs – 81 Tories, 31 Labour and five Lib Dems – had ethical and safety concerns, including Justice Secretary Chris Grayling who voted against the procedure.

Tory MP Fiona Bruce said the move was a ‘red line MPs should not cross’, adding: ‘The implications simply cannot be predicted, but one thing is for sure: Once this alteration has taken place… there will be no going back.’

'You're quite sure you just want to buy the one Mother's Day card?'

Labour MP Rob Flello said the technique had not been sufficiently tested and that families could suffer ‘tragic outcomes’. 

He said the US and China had banned similar techniques due to safety concerns.

Tory Sir Edward Leigh, a prominent Catholic, asked: ‘Where do we stop?’ 

But Andrew Miller, chairman of the Commons Science and Technology Committee, which held an inquiry into the procedure, said the fears were ‘ill-founded’. 

Trials led scientists to ‘conclude that the risks are small but worth taking because the benefits … are enormous’, he said.

Health minister Jane Ellison told MPs that the DNA in mitochondria accounts for only 0.054 per cent of a person’s overall DNA and none of their characteristics. 

She added: ‘Not only would children born through such techniques be free of these conditions, but so would their children … breaking a chain of misery that would have ruined generations of lives.’

Miss Ellison assured MPs that the procedure would be subject to ‘robust’ regulation.

Last night Newcastle University’s Professor Doug Turnbull, who pioneered the procedure, said he was ‘delighted’.

His patient Vicky Holliday, 38, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, hopes to have the treatment. 

The management consultant’s daughter, Jessica, one, suffers from Leigh syndrome, which means she is likely to die within a few years.

‘It would mean so much to us to be able to have a healthy child,’ Miss Holliday said. ‘Mitochondrial disease is unimaginably cruel.’

But the Church of England argues it is ‘irresponsible’ to pursue the move before more research, and the Catholic Church is opposed to artificial insemination.

Lawyer Cara Nuttall, of Slater & Gordon, said: ‘The law needs to deal with expectations of the donor and recipients, and make clear their legal status to any resulting child.’

Given the immense medical and moral significance of the issue, it was curious that MPs were given only 90 minutes to debate a law which would allow the creation of babies from two mothers and one father.

For as public health minister Jane Ellison told the Commons, this is a bold step to take, involving world-beating science. 

But it is also one with deep global implications.

Despite alarmist opposition over ‘three-parent children’, we already have more than two parents contributing biologically to the birth of children, with the use of egg donation and surrogacy

Britain has become the first country in the world to endorse this extraordinary genetic innovation, developed largely at Newcastle University, which involves mitochondrial replacement – healthy DNA from one woman being inserted into embryos from another.

This is particularly controversial since it means that genetic material will be carried by the newborn child and can be passed down future generations. 

Not surprisingly, it has provoked fears that hidden side-effects could emerge in future years.

But I strongly believe it was the right decision to take after an unusually exhaustive consultative process that does credit to our country, with three separate independent reviews over seven years. 

Crucially, the process does not impinge on the very complex nuclear DNA which contains the 23,000 genes that define the characteristics of a child.

And despite alarmist opposition over ‘three-parent children’, we already have more than two parents contributing biologically to the birth of children, with the use of egg donation and surrogacy.

Indeed, it could be argued that there are ‘four’ genetic parents involved when anyone is given an organ transplant – another modern medical intervention that highlights how science is constantly improving and extending the lives of human beings.

Prime Minister David Cameron supported the move and said: ‘As someone who has had the experience of having a severely disabled child [Ivan, who died six years ago] I have every sympathy with those parents

Back in the 1970s, critics also opposed the introduction of in-vitro fertilisation, with similar emotive talk of doctors ‘playing God’ and potentially lethal consequences.

But by the time the first ‘test-tube baby’ Louise Brown turned 21, such techniques had become routine, with 300,000 more people born by the process around the world.

As the parent of a child born in the early 1990s with complex disabilities due to a rare genetic disorder, I can understand the pain of families forced to watch children suffer neurological conditions that could now be avoided. 

I still suffer agonies seeing my daughter scream as she suffers epileptic seizures, tears forming in her eyes as she thrashes around. 

Although she is 21 and adorable, it still cuts to my core knowing she will never walk, talk or feed herself.

Some parents have seen a succession of children die in infancy or childhood due to faulty mitochondria – which can cause similar cases of complex epilepsy, as well as devastating conditions such as muscular dystrophy and even catastrophic organ failure.

Only one in 6,500 children develop these more serious disorders. Now, if the change in regulation is approved by the House of Lords, such children will gain the chance to live a full life.

Yet while I welcome this advance, one critical MP yesterday asked where do we stop? 

And he was right to pose this question, for there are moral questions that even this mild form of genetic engineering raises.

Some smug scientists now talk in excitable terms of eliminating all disabilities and, rather sinisterly, of ‘enhancing evolution’. 

This has been described as ‘back-door eugenics’ – the wiping out of certain types of people through medical advances.

This would certainly be dangerous in a society that still excludes far too many people with disabilities from mainstream life and which aborts a rising number of children on grounds of an often comparatively minor disorder such as Down’s syndrome.

So even as I praise yesterday’s sensible decision, we still have to deal with the implications of this brave new world. 

However amazing these medical advances are, they also raise profound issues going to the heart of human existence.
