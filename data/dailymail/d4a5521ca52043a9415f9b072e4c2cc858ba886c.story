President Barack Obama says the possible chemical weapons attack in Syria this week is a 'big event of grave concern' that has hastened the timeframe for determining a U.S. response.

'This is something that is going to require America's attention,' Obama said during an interview broadcast Friday.

Obama's comments on Syria were his first since Wednesday's alleged chemical weapons attack on the eastern suburbs of Damascus that killed at least 100 people. While he appeared to signal some greater urgency for a U.S. response, his comments were largely in line with his previous statements throughout the two-year conflict.

The president said the notion that the U.S. alone can end Syria's bloody civil war is 'overstated' and made clear he would seek international support before taking large-scale action.

Serious decisions: President Barack Obama said that he will be taking action over the attack on Wednesday where chemical weapons were used

'If the U.S. goes in and attacks 
another country without a U.N. mandate and without clear evidence that 
can be presented, then there are questions in terms of whether 
international law supports it, do we have the coalition to make it 
work,' he said in the interview on CNN's 'New Day' show.

The president said the U.S. is still seeking conclusive evidence that chemical weapons were used this week.

Such
actions, he said, would be troubling and detrimental to 'some core 
national interests that the United States has, both in terms of us 
making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating, as 
well as needing to protect our allies, our bases in the region.'

Wednesday's
attack came as a United Nations team was on the ground in Syria 
investigating earlier chemical weapons use. Obama has warned that 
deployment of the deadly gases would cross a 'red line,' but the U.S. 
response to the confirmed attacks earlier this year has been minimal.

Parents weep as they look for their children among the dead: Syria's government denies launching the latest attack on Wednesday and pictures show that some victims had foam coming from their mouths

More
than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria during more than two 
years of clashes between forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad 
and opposition fighters seeking to overthrow his regime.

The
U.S. has long called for Assad to go and has sent humanitarian aid to 
the rebels, but those steps have failed to push the Syrian leader from 
power.

Obama addressed the 
deepening crisis in Syria from central New York, where he is on a 
two-day bus tour promoting policies to make college more affordable.

His interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo covered a wide range of topics, including America's changing stance on Egypt.

'The
aid itself may not reverse what the interim government does but I think
that what most Americans would say is that we have to be very careful 
about what would be seen as aiding and abetting actions that we think 
run contrary to our values and ideals,' he said.

'There's
no doubt that we can't return to business as usual given what's 
happened,' he said referring to the recent attacks on civilians that 
left hundreds dead.

'There 
was a space right after Mr Morsi was removed in which we did a lot of 
heavy lifting and a lot of diplomatic work to try to encourage the 
military to move in a path of reconciliation- they did not take that 
opportunity.'

Turning his attention to domestic issues- both within the United States and the White House.

He
said that he is concerned about the safeguards at the NSA that led to 
more Americans' emails being read than legally allowed.

'People
are still concerned as to whether their emails are being read or if 
their phone calls are being listened to,' the President said.

Documents released this week showed the National Security Agency may have unintentionally collected as many as 56,000 emails of Americans per year between 2008 and 2011. A secret U.S. court subsequently said the program may have violated U.S. law.

The revelations led to new questions about operations by the eavesdropping NSA and its oversight by the secret U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC).

Obama said the discovery of the mistake and the court's demand that safeguards be improved showed the system of oversight had functioned appropriately.

'All these safeguards, checks, audits, oversight worked,' he said in the interview on CNN's 'New Day' program.

Obama said he was confident the NSA was not abusing its powers.

'What I recognize is that we're going to have to continue to improve the safeguards and, as technology moves forward, that means that we may be able to build technologies that give people more assurance, and we do have to do a better job of giving people confidence in how these programs work,' he said.

New addition: President Obama said that Sunny (right) is faster, friskier, and a better jumper than Bo (left)

The
lightest topic of conversation was the new family dog, Sunny, and 
President Obama told how Bo was getting lonely now that his daughters- 
who he referred to as the 'two other puppies'- have grown up.

'(Sasha
and Malia) still have some responsibilities for him but they're not 
always around between school, sports practice, all that stuff, so Bo was
starting to look a little down in the dumps,' he said.

'The truth is (Sunny's) faster than he is, she jumps higher, she's friskier- and he is trying to keep up.

'Right
now Michelle is in full parenting mode and really focused on getting 
Sunny to sit and catch,' but he admitted that 'there have been a few 
accidents'.
