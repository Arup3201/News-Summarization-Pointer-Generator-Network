It's bad enough when someone goes on holiday and fills your Instagram feed with photos showing off the incredible places where they are staying or  eating.

But for models, actresses or singers to slip into a string bikini, twist their limbs into a flying lotus position and pose on a private beach with the wind in their hair,  it's too much to bear.

In the latest and greatest way to show their worth, celebrities the world over are snapping what's been popularly dubbed 'smug yoga selfies'.
