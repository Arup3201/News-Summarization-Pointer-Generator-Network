Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has suggested Danny Welbeck and Olivier Giroud may have to battle it out for a central striking role in his starting line-up.

Wenger will be able to call on the services of Welbeck and Giroud for the first time against Manchester United this weekend as the Frenchman has returned from a foot injury.

Giroud has not played for Arsenal since sustaining a foot injury against Everton in August, while Welbeck has scored five goals since joining the north London outfit from Manchester United.

Ahead of Arsenal's showdown with Manchester United, Wenger said on the duo: 'There’s always a fight because we have a lot of offensive options.

'Welbeck can play in different positions up front and there is room for both of them to start in some games. Of course it is a fight.'

Wenger also revealed he has always respected Welbeck as a footballer and has responded to Louis van Gaal's claims that he was never going to be an Old Trafford regular.

'I always respected Danny and I always felt that he had a great future.

'What he has achieved in the last few months has certainly allowed him to gain more respect, especially for the English national team as well - he’s now one of the main players in the national team and he showed that again in Scotland.

'I believe that you have to understand Louis van Gaal had not had Welbeck under his command for a long time and it’s always very difficult to know the players well when you see them for three or four weeks.

'Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie have an exceptional goalscoring record - he had two quality players in front of him. What he needed was a chance.'
