A 40m water tower dating back to the Victorian era and nicknamed 'Jumbo' is going up for sale after its former owner failed in a bid to turn it into a block of flats.

The grade II*-listed building, constructed in 1883, dominates the town of Colchester in Essex and is England's tallest 19th century water tower.

It has stood disused for more than 25 years, following a series of failed attempts to secure planning permission to transform it into a luxury home.

For sale: This 40m-high water tower nicknamed 'Jumbo' dominates the town of Colchester in Essex

The height of the tower means that it has unparalled views over the town and the surrounding area.

It was built to store Colchester's water supply, using 1.2million bricks and 400 tonnes of cement.

The tower is topped with a viewing platform, accessed via a central spiral staircase with a total of 157 steps.

It went out of use for the last time in 1987, leading to a long-running battle over its future.

An evangelical Christian group converted the building into a 'prayer tower' and installed a banner saying 'Jesus is Lord' across the exterior.

Jumbo was then bought by a property developer who attempted to turn it into a block of flats - but the council blocked the proposal in a bid to preserve the tower's historic interior.

In 2006, businessman George Braithwaite bought the tower at auction for £330,000, with permission to turn it into a single home.

However, he proposed a more ambitious renovation project including a museum, restaurant, offices and flats, and last year he was denied planning permission.

Mr Braithwaite has now put the tower back on the market, but has not yet revealed what the asking price will be.

Dominant: The tower is a well-known local landmark thanks to its striking appearance and huge size

'The Jumbo water tower is a wonderful example of Victorian civic architecture,' said David Ross of tourism website Britain Express.

'The striking brick tower standing 131 feet high is built to hold 221,000 gallons of water.

'Beset by technical problems and political wrangling when it was built, the tower represents a marvellous feat of Victorian engineering that deserves its place as an icon of historic Colchester.

'It would be a travesty if an historic building like Jumbo was lost to future generations - it encapsulates the boundless self-confidence of the Victorian age, and should be preserved as a heritage treasure for future generations.'

The new owner of 'Jumbo' will possess one of the most striking buildings in Essex - but it could prove to be a white elephant.

Since the tower went out of use in 1987, a variety of new uses have been proposed, but none of them has ever come to fruition.

After a brief period of use as a 'prayer tower', festooned with a banner proclaiming a Christian message, a property developer tried to turn Jumbo into luxury flats.

After that plan fell through, an even more ambitious proposal to install a museum, restaurant and offices was also denied planning permission.

The new owner will probably be able to build a penthouse flat in the tower - but would have to provide public access to the viewing platform 40m up from the ground.

A number of campaign groups have in the past pushed to preserve Jumbo as a monument to the great Victorian era of civil engineering.

One plan would see it opened to the public in a bid to educate people about the way the Victorians helped ensure access to clean water for the whole of Britain for the first time ever.

The Balkerne Tower Trust is currently seeking donations to enable it to bid for Jumbo at the forthcoming sale and restore the tower to its former glory.
