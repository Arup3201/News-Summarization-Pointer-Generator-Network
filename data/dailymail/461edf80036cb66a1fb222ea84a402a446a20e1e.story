Brutally beaten: Jerry Payne, 36, as seen when he was placed into jail following his arrest

An Oklahoma police department has placed multiple officers on leave after video of them beating a drunk driving suspect surfaced this week.

Four officers with the Miami (OK) Ploice Department have been suspended with pay while investigators work to determine why an Oklahoma Highway Patrol dashcam showed two cops holding down and kicking Jerry Payne, 36, in the head during a May traffic stop.

Officers Teresa Lashmet and Jeremy Myers, as well as two other unnamed police have been placed on leave, the Tulsa World originally reported.

Dashcam footage shows the OHP cruiser speed up to catch Mr Payne, who initially refuses to get out of his truck while two officers bark commands at him, this despite the official police report written by Ms Lashmet saying he ‘immediately’ exited the truck.

‘You're going to see where she says the driver immediately got out of his truck,’ Josh Lee, Mr Payne’s attorney told KOTV. ‘He never gets out of his truck.’

The report says Mr Payne exited the truck, then got back in and asked ‘what the f**k did I do?’ But the video shows an entirely different scene.

Mr Payne is sitting in his truck while two officers talk to him. Soon, a state trooper, identified in the report as Kenny McKee, is shown pulling the driver out by his neck and pinning him to the ground.

The report says that ‘McKee then pulled Payne from the truck and we placed him on the ground using a straight arm bar technique.’

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Unprovoked: An officer, presumably Jeremy Myers, based on the arrest affidavit, is seen rushing in to kick Jerry Payne's head

Inaccurate: The arrest report written by Theresa Lashmet does not match the dashcam footage

There appears to be a short struggle restraining Mr Payne on the ground, which is documented in the report, but what happens next isn’t mentioned in the affidavit.

Another officer rushes in from the right side and appears to kick Mr Payne in the head before falling onto and helping restrain him.

The report says simply that ‘Officer Myers then arrived on the scene and assisted me in getting control of Payne.’

‘The other Miami police officer comes from back over here, and this is when he comes running and kicks Mr. Payne right in the face and you see his head snap back pretty good,’ the attorney explained to KOTV.

Pictures of Mr Payne at the time he was admitted to jail showed multiple wounds to his face, as well as blood.

Another attorney for Mr Payne told NewsOK he suffered broken teeth, a bloody lip, bumps, bruises and 
scrapes all over his face.

Not a threat: Mr Payne is shown sitting in his truck and never exiting, in stark contrast to the affidavit

Choke-slam: An officer can be seen throwing Mr Payne to the ground by his neck

Already restrained: This image shown, shortly before Mr Payne was kicked in the head, does not indicate further restraint was required

The arrest report says Mr Payne ‘received a scratch on his left cheek and a bump above his left eye.’County jail records show a Jeremy Myers as the arresting officer.

A DUI charge was dropped last month shortly after the video was made public.

A call by MailOnline to the Miami Police Department was meant with resistance before being forced to leave a voicemail – which has not yet been returned.

Mr Lee wants the city to file perjury and assault and battery charges against the police involved, he told KOTV.

A message left with an assistant to Mr Lee requesting further comment was not returned, nor was a message left at a number shown in prison records belonging to Mr Payne.

The trooper involved has not been suspended, an OHP spokesperson confirmed.
