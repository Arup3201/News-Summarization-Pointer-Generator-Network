Nigel Farage is preparing to muscle into the battle against Scottish independence following his historic success in the European elections.

The UKIP leader wants to open a new front in the campaign against the SNP, to the horror of the established Better Together allies.

Mr Farage was yesterday basking in the glory of winning his first seat north of the Border in a major humiliation for Alex Salmond, who had pleaded with Scots to make a direct choice between the SNP and Ukip.

Nigel Farage wants to use his European election triumph as a springboard to stop Alex Salmond splitting Scotland off from the rest of the UK in September's independence referendum

David Coburn, UKIP’s victorious candidate in Scotland, yesterday thanked the First Minister for polarising the debate, as Labour accused the SNP of foolishly delivering a boost for Mr Farage. In a stinging attack, Labour's Scottish leader Johann Lamont said: 'Scotland now has three nationalist MEPs.'

After winning more than 140,000 votes in the contest, Mr Farage is now planning repeat visits Scotland in the run-up to September’s referendum as he feels he has a legitimate platform to speak out in favour of the Union.

He told the Mail: 'With the election of David Coburn as the first UKIP MEP [in Scotland], we have not just put a fox into Westminster’s henhouse, we have put a pine marten into the Holyrood one.

'We are the only truly national political party, and the success of UKIP in Scotland in these elections proves that there is a voice for those who believe in an independent Scotland as part of the UK.

'Alex Salmond now finally has to deal honestly and openly with the key contradictions in his position – independence in Europe is no independence at all.

'They know it, we know it, and now we can see the Scottish people know it as well.'

Mr Farage added: 'We have proven over the last few days that we are genuinely a UK independence party.

'Most of you have thought for years that every Ukip voter is a retired half colonel living on the edge of Salisbury plain desperate for the re-introduction for the birch and only cheering up after the first pink gin of the day.

'Well, we have got a few of those that vote for us there is no doubt about it. But actually we cross all social divides.

'In terms of geography that’s even more fascinating. We have made a breakthrough in Scotland - something which Alex Salmond will not enjoy very much at all. And we will inject a completely new dynamic into the referendum on separation that is coming up on September 18 this year.'

SNP leader Alex Salmond is confident of winning September's independence referendum despite polls showing a narrowing, but consistent lead for the 'No' campaign

Nigel Farage was all smiles during a meeting of the leaders of European Parliament political groups in Brussels today

The UKIP leader was back in Brussels today after last week's European election triumph in which he topped the polls - pushing Labour into second narrowly ahead of the Tories

The final results of the European election were announced in Scotland yesterday lunchtime, with the SNP holding on for victory, despite a sharp rise in Labour’ s support.

With just over one-third of Scots voting in the contest - a total of 1.35million adults - the Nationalists won 28.9 per cent (389,503 votes) – down 0.2 points since 2009 – and Labour won 25.9 per cent (348,219 votes), up 5.1 points.

That handed both parties two seats in the European Parliament, with the Tories picking up a seat after winning a better-than-expected 17.2 per cent (231,330 votes) – it’s best total for around a quarter of a century.

Ukip secured an historic and unexpected fourth place, picking up Scotland’s sixth and final seat with 140,534 votes and a 10.4 per cent share, despite a shambolic campaign north of the Border. The Greens won 8 per cent and pushing the LibDems into a humiliating sixth place.

At the declaration of results in Edinburgh, Mr Coburn was rebuffed when he cheekily asked Shadow Scottish Secretary Margaret Curran if he could join the anti-independence Better Together campaign. Organisers have officially banned Ukip from joining the Tory/Labour/LibDem group, amid fears of fringe elements within the party.

But Mr Coburn said: 'The Ukip revolution has now come to Scotland.

He added: 'I’d like to thank Alex Salmond for his tremendous help in getting us elected.'

Throughout the election campaign, the SNP attempted to persuade Scots there was a direct contest between the third candidate on their list, Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, and Mr Coburn.

Ukip’s success now makes it much harder for Mr Salmond to argue that Scotland and England are ‘different countries’ as he bids to boost support ahead of the independence referendum in September.

In desperation, the First Minister has resorted to blaming the media.

With 1.35million votes cast, the SNP won the backing of 389,503 Scots in Thursday’s contest, with Labour

But as yesterday’s results were announced, Labour’s lead candidate David Martin said: 'I’d like to suggest to David Coburn that the first thing he does when he sits down and recovers from the champagne is write a letter to Alex Salmond because there is no doubt in my mind that Alex Salmond’s decision to polarise the campaign, the Scottish debate, between two extremes is why David Coburn is with us today as a member of the European Parliament.'

That was met with mutterings of ‘poor show’ by deputy SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon.

She said later: 'Ukip topped the poll in England and have scraped the final seat in Scotland. The gulf between the performances is absolutely massive.'

Scotland's First Minister has turned the tables on Labour following devolution, becoming the dominant party in Holyrood  - despite an electoral system designed to make one-party rule extremely difficult to achieve

But Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont said: 'From Poland to France, Greece to Scotland we have seen the rise of nationalism and Scotland now has three nationalist MEPs.

'Alex Salmond and Nigel Farage represent the same things, but our country deserves better than the simple analysis that our neighbours are the problem dressed up in saloon bar charm. Those of us who believe in a just and fair Scotland need to stand firm in the face of these two.'

In response, SNP MEP Alyn Smith said: 'This is a boomerang attack from Johann Lamont – the hypocrisy of which helps explains why the SNP have just defeated Labour in yet another national election in Scotland, after more than seven years in government.

'Ukip did worse in Scotland than in any other part of Britain by far. Ukip topped the poll south of the Border because the Westminster parties have pandered to their agenda in Scotland. The SNP took them on – and we won the election.'

Tory MEP Ian Duncan, who takes over from the retired Struan Stevenson, said his party’s vote is the highest it has been for 25 years.

'We’ve bucked the national trend and it is a reminder that we have much to offer the people of Scotland,' he said.

'People are concerned about Europe and they want change. They want change to make Europe work for them, not against them, and I believe we have harnessed that concern and that feeling in a very simple way.'

Green candidate Maggie Chapman said: 'In this election we asked ‘What kind of Scotland do you want?’ The response has been the biggest-ever vote for the Greens, showing growing support for our vision of a Scotland which prizes economic justice, welcomes new Scots from around the world, and stands for peace.'
