When many think of the term nude, the image that often comes to mind is of something on the paler end of the spectrum, as these shades are usually labelled 'nude' whether it be make-up, heels or lingerie.

But what some of us think of as nude only relates to a specific skin tone, obviously and one lingerie company has decided that it's about time all women have the choice to go nude.

Nubian Skin is launching a range of nude bras for women with darker skin, in several different shades to cater to all skin tones.

Redefining nude: Nubian Skin's lingerie comes in several shades to suit all skin tones

Catering to women of colour: The brand says that they felt the need to fill the gap in the lingerie market

Not so nude: 'The industry simply doesn't cater to us. So, I thought, it’s time to rethink the definition of nude'

Writing on its blog, the company's founder  says, 'My nude isn’t the nude I see in shops. Despite the reality that women of colour have the same needs as all women when it comes to lingerie and hosiery (and spend the same of their hard-earned money), the industry simply doesn't cater to us.

'So, I thought, it’s time to rethink the definition of nude.' 

The problem is one that the company believes also resides in the cosmetics industry.

'It took Eunice W. Johnson to create Fashion Fair Cosmetics in 1973 for black women to really have an adequate choice in finding makeup colours to suit them. 

'In the 1990s and 2000s, mainstream brands began to realise the value of providing to women of colour, and despite the billions we spend on make up each year, there are still brands that have chosen not to provide an offering for us' she says.

Problem: The company believes that the issue of 'nude' colours is also present in the cosmetics industry

True colours: The bras, knickers and hosiery will come in several shades in both plain and lacy styles

The darkest shade is 'Berry', which the brand suggests would suit women who wear foundations such as Mac NW50, Bobbi Brown Espresso 10 and Yves Saint Laurent Le Teint in Beige 90.

The darker the berry: The darkest shade of lingerie is 'Berry' and comes in sizes 30B to 36E
