Comic Jim Davidson told a half-empty crowd at his stand-up gig that his life has been ruined by his arrest over sex attack allegations.

In front of an audience in Telford last night, just hours after his release, he said he 'just had to keep telling the truth' to police.

Scotland Yard re-arrested him on Wednesday on suspicion of sexual offences as part of Operation Yewtree, having first arrested him in January this year.

He said his life had been ruined by his arrests over sex attack 
allegations

The probe was sparked by the Savile 
scandal but Davidson's alleged crimes are not linked to those of the 
paedophile Top Of The Pops presenter.

He said: 'These last six months have 
been the worst of my life, my life has been ruined. But I know she has 
to keep up the lie, I just have to keep telling the truth.

Jim Davidson has been married five times and has five children by three of the wivesSue Walpole (1971–1972; divorced), 1 childJulie Gullick (1981–1986; divorced), 1 childAlison Holloway (1987–1988; divorced)Tracy Hilton (1990–2000; divorced), 3 childrenMichelle Cotton (2010–current)

'I have been rearrested, which means 
you turn up thinking the first two allegations are gonna be dropped and 
another f*****g load of s**t drops on you from 1978.

'I don't know what I was doing in 1978, I don't even know what wife I was with then.'

He laughed off sex attack claims made
against him when he told fans at his stand-up gig that police had gone 'mental' because they had failed to catch pop paedophile Jimmy Savile.

The former Big Break star, 59, was held as he answered bail on Wednesday, two months after he was seized at Heathrow.

Following his latest grilling the ex-Generation Game host again continued to 'vigorously' deny all the claims.

Earlier he stunned the audience telling them he "only sh****d old slappers' rather than children.

He added: 'Me and you women are through, I'm not even gonna take my f*****g c*** out for a piss anymore.

'Do you think the police have gone mental?

'I met Jimmy Savile, if he arrived you f*****d off, and now the git drops dead and Operation Yewtree decide to prove a point.

'They say 'we missed Jimmy Savile, now were gonna arrest every other f****r that walks the planet'.

'You know me though, you've heard all
the jokes, you've seen all the stuff you know more about me than I do, 
you certainly know more than the cops.'

The original allegations were made by two women who accused him of molesting them.

Scotland Yard have confirmed a 59-year-old had been 'arrested on suspicion of sexual offences' as part of Operation Yewtree.

The probe was sparked by the Savile 
scandal but Davidson's alleged crimes are not linked to those of the 
paedophile Top Of The Pops presenter.

The new claims against the five-times 
wed comic emerged a week after DJ Dave Lee Travis, 67, was also 
rearrested. He too denies wrongdoing.

London-born Davidson was again bailed by police until May. He is one of 11 suspects so far in the Yewtree inquiry.

Davidson's lawyer Henri Brandman 
stressed the comic had not been charged with an offence telling 
reporters: 'He answered police questions as fully as he is able.'
