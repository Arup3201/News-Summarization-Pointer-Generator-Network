Channel 4 will broadcast a show featuring Educating Yorkshire star Musharaf Asghar, known as Mushy on how he helps other people who suffer from speech impediments. 

The teenager stole the hearts of the nation after he overcame his stammer to address his school assembly. 

Despite his affliction, Mushy was able to achieve a C grade in his English GSCE and has progressed to college. 

Musharaf Asghar, pictured, has been given his own show by Channel 4 where he helps other people with speech impediments overcome their difficulties building on his own experience of battling against adversity

However, such was his impact, Channel 4 decided to commission 'Stammer School' where Mushy helps fellow sufferers with speech impediments.

Channel 4 Education Editor Bec Milligan said: 'Stammer School is a fantastic reflection of our current education strategy, it tackles issues relevant to a young audience in an engaging and inspiring way.'

The show's creater David Clews added: 'Most of us take speaking for granted. Seeing Musharaf find his voice in Educating Yorkshire was incredibly moving. It’s a huge privilege to be able to follow Mushy, and others, as they attempt to beat their stammers, hopefully with life changing results.'

Speaking to The Observer, Mushy said: 'I hope it will have a positive impact on other people with stammers to speak more and not give up on their dreams. Over the last year my confidence has grown, and I'm not afraid to speak any more. I'm going into my second year at college, which is going well. I just want people to be more aware of stammering, and I think Educating Yorkshire helped with this.'

Mushy came to public prominence when Channel 4 installed cameras inside Thornhill Community Academy in Dewsbury, Yorkshire. 

The cameras will return to the school to cover the release of this year's GCSE results before movign to a third series of the fly-on-the-wall documentary, this time based in north east London. 

Educating the East End will feature the Frederick Bremer school in Walthamstow. 

The first series of the show was based in Harlow, Essex. 

According to Mr Clews: 'It's about kids you really identify with, a very working-class area, a bog-standard comprehensive. A capital city school, but there's no knife crime, there's no metal detectors in the school.'

The show, Stammer School: Musharaf Finds His Voice will be broadcast on Channel 4 on August 28.
