Sisters-in-law who robbed a grandmother in the street, tearing out clumps of her hair, punching her in the head and stealing her phone have been spared jail.

Chelsea Coyne, 28, pounced on the woman from behind, before kicking her and punching her as she lay defenceless on the pavement. Seconds later Rachael Coyne, 25, swiped her mobile phone.

The attack on the 48-year-old grandmother was caught on the Mitre Hotel's CCTV cameras and helped secure the convictions of the Coynes, who have now been sentenced for the attack.

Manchester Magistrates' Court was 
told that the woman had been enjoying a drink in the hotel and pub 
following a Christmas shopping trip with her son's girlfriend.

As she chatted to her son on her phone outside the venue, Chelsea Coyne ‘jumped’ her, with the brunette repeatedly kicking the victim and punching her in the head.

Subhanur Chowdhury, prosecuting, said: 'She was speaking with her son on her mobile phone.

'At
 that point, she was jumped on and ended up on the floor. She was being 
repeatedly kicked whilst on the floor and being punched around the head.

'She manages to get up then realises that she had dropped the phone.'

The victim suffered ‘substantial injuries’ to 
her face and forehead and lost hair on the back of her head when it was 
pulled during the attack, the court was told.

The woman, a grandmother-of-four from Ancoats, said she suffers from headaches following the incident.

'I feel like I am living a nightmare,' she said in a statement read to the court.

'It is so hard to put into words. I feel embarrassed.'

Chelsea Coyne pleaded guilty to assault following the attack in December last year.

Her sister-in-law Rachael Coyne picked up the woman’s white iPhone after she dropped it during the attack and both then walked away. The blonde denied theft but was found guilty after a trial.

The court heard the victim had returned to the pub the day after the attack and secured the CCTV footage for the police.

Dominic Ingle, defending, claimed the victim suffered from alopecia, which had contributed to her hair loss.

He said: 'It was an unpleasant assault but there is far more to this than meets the eye.

'This is not a black and white matter. They are genuinely good people. They have made a very, very, severe mistake.'

Chelsea Coyne, of Miles Platting, Manchester, was sentenced to a six-month community order and a six-week curfew.

Rachael Coyne, also of Miles Platting, was sentenced to a 12-month community order with 150 hours of unpaid work. Both women were also ordered to pay costs and compensation, and have been given a  two-year restraining order preventing them from contacting the victim.
