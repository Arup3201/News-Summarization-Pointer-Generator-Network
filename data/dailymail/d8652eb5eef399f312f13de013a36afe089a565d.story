A traumatised policeman says he'll never forget the look of pure hatred in the eyes of a man who doused the officer in petrol, then tried to strike a lighter.

Senior Constable Matthew Hill said he constantly relives his ordeal, saying he was sent to a job where 'a person had covered themselves in flammable liquid and was threatening to set themselves on fire'.

'As this information was relayed to me, every single hair on my body stood on end and I froze up,' he said in his victim impact statement read out in the SA District Court on Wednesday.

Kieran David Cregan, 63, has pleaded guilty to an aggravated count of endangering life on April 4 last year at Camden Park in Adelaide, when he was extremely drunk on his birthday.

Snr Const Hill said he expected that his life sometimes would be placed at risk to protect the public and uphold the law.

'But to think my life was risked over such a trivial matter still leaves me flabbergasted,' he said.

'The look of pure hatred and rage in your eyes as you came at me with the bucket and then again as you thrust the cigarette lighter into my chest and attempted to strike it - I will never forget that look.'

He had nightmares and constantly replayed the events, step by step, and even felt guilty in having had to hit Cregan to disarm him.

He also relived the events every time he smelt petrol which happened daily when he filled up the patrol car with fuel, when he mowed the lawn and even when he drove past a service station.

His life had changed forever knowing that had the lighter sparked, he would be dead or terribly burned.

'Despite my lack of physical scarring, you have permanently changed my life nonetheless.'

Cregan's lawyer Robert Kane said his client, whose main problem was alcohol, had a horrific childhood but had the support of his siblings and daughter.

While the prosecution called for Cregan to be jailed, Mr Kane asked the judge to consider suspending any sentence.

Judge Geraldine Davison will sentence him on October 23.
