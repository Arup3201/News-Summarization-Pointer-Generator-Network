A doctor who was suspended for arranging a boob job that went horribly wrong has been allowed to return work.

Dr Ashish Dutta was suspended in 2012 after Andrea Scott was left with scarring and burst stitching following her breast augmentation at the Aesthetic Beauty Centre in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.

Ms Scott, from County Durham, paid thousands of pounds to even up the size of her breasts after a tummy tuck and gastric bypass left them uneven.

Dr Dutta did not perform 
the surgery, but arranged the operation and advised Ms Scott despite 
being subject to a six-month suspension at the time.

Dr Dutta appealed the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service decision, but it was upheld ‘in its entirety’ after a hearing at the High Court in Manchester in February last year.

A panel had branded Dr Dutta a ‘risk to patient safety’ and found him guilty of ‘serious professional misconduct’ at a hearing in September 2012.

Dr Dutta told a review hearing this week he learned a ‘bitter lesson’ from the experience and promised not to repeat his behaviour.

The panel, chaired by Dr Linda Buchanan, ruled it was safe to allow him back to work, but only under a string of ten conditions, which will keep him closely monitored by the GMC.

‘The panel is satisfied that you have demonstrated sufficient insight into, and awareness of, your past misconduct. It is also satisfied that you are highly unlikely to repeat your past behaviour,’ said Dr Buchanan.

‘The panel considers that a further period of suspension would be disproportionate given the progress you have made in your remediation and that conditional registration would safeguard patient safety whilst allowing you to return to practice.’

The conditions, which will apply for two years, require Dr Dutta to inform the GMC of any medical posts he takes and if he is made subject to any disciplinary proceedings.

His work, including all cosmetic procedures, must be supervised by a consultant and he cannot carry out breast augmentation unless he is directly supervised by a breast surgeon.

The conditions will come into force in 28 days, subject to appeal, but Dr Dutta will remain suspended during that period.

He will have to attend another review hearing towards the end of the period of conditional registration before he can return to unrestricted practice.

The surgeon who carried out the operation to even out the size of Ms Scott’s breasts is also currently facing General Medical Council allegations of misconduct over her treatment.

Mohammad Azhar Aslam inserted the 800cc implants, which were ‘too big and heavy’ and were likely to cause problems because ‘gravity only works one way’.

Mr Aslam faces a series of charges relating to deficiencies in his treatment of four women between 2004 and 2010.

He denies any of the procedures were inappropriate or any of the care inadequate, but has admitted two allegations relating to poor record keeping.

After the operation in early 2010, Ms Scott said that the stitches on her left breast burst open and her implant started to sag from the wound.

She told the panel at Mr Aslam’s hearing she had first noticed wetness around the stitching area underneath her left breast at the end of February 2010.

‘Within two weeks it had gone from a tiny whole to the size of a 20 pence whole to the size of a 50 pence whole, to then having a blister,’ she added.

Ms Scott said she had received ‘absolutely atrocious’ aftercare and had needed four separate operations to correct the problem.

For two years Dr Dutta will not be allowed to carry out any procedures without the supervision of a consultant and he will not be allowed to perform breast surgery without the presence of a breast surgeon. Image shows Ms Scott's breasts after the botched op

She says she has also been left £45,000 out of pocket and that she has psychological scars from the experience.

Ms Scott said: 'I just went to the surgery to get it fixed. But it's affected my business and my relationship. I've struggled to come to terms with it, I've seen a psychiatrist and they've said I have an adjustment disorder.

'I don't want to think about it, but one of the worst side effects of the condition is suicide. This whole thing has totally taken over my life.

'I've had two years of not going anywhere, and my business has totally failed because I couldn't go to work.

'Before I had it done I would get out of the shower and it wouldn't be a problem. Now I don't even like looking at myself in the mirror.'
