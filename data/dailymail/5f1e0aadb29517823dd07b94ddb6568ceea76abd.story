Leicester are in discussions about taking Andrej Kramaric on a permanent deal after Chelsea failed to guarantee that the player would return to them at the end of the season.

HNK Rijeka striker Kramaric wanted to sign for Chelsea and had agreed personal terms but did not want to spend his time on loan elsewhere next season.

Leicester are now exploring the possibility of offering extra bonus payments to entice Kramaric for them.

Andrej Kramaric looks set to join a Premier League side with Chelsea and Leicester chasing his signature

Chelsea had planned to loan Kramaric to Leicester, here's why they can't...

Premier League Rule V.7.1

'A Temporary Transfer to a Club may not take place in the Transfer Window in which the Transferor Club acquired the Player's registration.'

This PL rule wrecked the plan for Chelsea to sign Kramaric from Rijeka then loan him to Leicester and complicated the move.

But the rule only covers loan deals between PL clubs. It would not have stopped Chelsea signing Kramaric and then loaning him abroad, as they did with Kurt Zouma last January.

Chelsea now seem to have backed out of the deal altogether, leaving Leicester to pick up negotiations to sign him permanently.

The player travelled to London on Monday and is in discussions with both clubs.

Chelsea had initially outlined an £8million deal that would see the player loaned to Leicester for the rest of the season.

But this has been complicated as Premier League Rule V.7.1 states the loan deal between the Premier League clubs would not be allowed, preventing him from joining Leicester immediately after signing for Chelsea.

Leicester, who signed Mark Schwarzer from Chelsea last week, have been keen to back manager Nigel Pearson in his bid to salvage their Premier League status.

That is evident in their pursuit of a striker.

Apart from their efforts to sign Kramaric, they have made an offer to Toronto for Jermain Defoe and have tabled an £8m bid for Mainz forward Shinji Okazaki.

The Japan international has scored eight goals in 16 games this season but Mainz want £10m for the 28-year-old.

Leicester have also made a £7.5m offer for Danny Ings at Burnley and have had a £750,000 offer for Wigan's Shaun Maloney rejected.

West Bromwich Albion do not need to sell Saido Berahino to fund new signings.

The 21-year-old has been linked with Tottenham and Liverpool but the London club have no intention of bidding for the striker in January while the Reds are not planning to spend at this stage.

Albion have not had an offer for Berahino, who is valued at £25million, and he will stay at West Brom barring any late change of plans but Tony Pulis still wants to add around three players.

Club record striker Brown Ideye could leave, however, as Sunderland, Newcastle and Hull have retained an interest despite his lack of goals since his £10m summer move from Dinamo Kiev.

Lille have played down the prospects of Divock Origi joining Liverpool early from his season-long loan.

Liverpool need a striker and have clubs showing interest in Fabio Borini and Rickie Lambert but Origi has scored just four goals this season and is struggling to find the form that earned him a starting place for Belgium at the World Cup.

Divock Origi is unlikely to join Liverpool in this transfer window 

Being thrust into the spotlight at Anfield where the pressure is greater is not seen as the wisest move. The player is keen to join but much may hinge on how Daniel Sturridge looks on his return to Melwood this week and how his thigh holds up to training and games.

Lille director Jean-Michel Vandamme said: 'Origi to Liverpool now? It would cost at least £4.7m but at the moment it is not possible.'

They have been searching for a replacement for Origi with QPR target Kolbeinn Sigthorsson of Ajax one of their options. However, they have clubs hiking up the price thinking they are due more money from Liverpool.

Liverpool have yet to step up interest in Xherdan Shaqiri of Bayern Munich who is talking to Inter Milan and Juventus but are on the lookout for a cheap goalkeeper if they can find one.

Southampton are interested in Porto defender Bruno Martins Indi.

The Holland international was a target for Ronald Koeman in the summer but had already agreed a move to Portugal. Now Koeman is back in for Indi, a target for Everton and Liverpool in the past, who can play at centre-back and full-back.

He has been capped on 26 occasions by his country and Southampton will see if a deal can be done this month with Porto keen for cash.

Manchester United are poised to offer a professional contract to young Belgian Indy Boonen.

The left-back has impressed in two trial spells and has recently been joined by his younger brother Seppe, 13, at United's Carrington training complex. Indy left Genk last summer but is now set to realise a dream by joining United's youth ranks.

Meanwhile, Chelsea this week hope to beat Liverpool, Arsenal and United to St Etienne starlet Rayan Souici, 16. The defensive midfielder is already being compared with his idol Paul Pogba of Juventus.

Arsenal target and St Etienne captain Loic Perrin has confirmed that he has been contacted over a move to the Emirates Stadium. Speaking after St Etienne's French Cup victory over AS Nancy, he said: 'I have been contacted personally. Arsenal is interested, but for now there is still no contact with Saint-Etienne.'

Saint-Etienne-born Perrin, 29, who made his professional debut with his hometown club in 2003 and has made 235 top-flight appearances for them, was one of seven reserves named by Didier Deschamps for France's 2014 World Cup squad, and has been named in recent Les Bleus' squads. He is valued at £6m and can play at centre-back, right-back and defensive midfield.

Iain Hume is on the lookout for a new club. The 31-year-old striker has returned from India where he was voted ISL Player of the League following his exploits with David James's Kerala Blasters.

Oldham had been showing interest before controversially switching their attention to Ched Evans. Hume also has interest from the MLS and Bundesliga.

Barcelona are to offer new terms to defender Dani Alves.

The right-back, who has been offered to Manchester United among others by intermediaries, is out of contract in the summer and free to talk to foreign clubs. 

Barcelona are set to offer Dani Alves a new deal at the club as his current contract runs out in the summer

He maintained last week that he has yet to be offered a new deal but club officials insist an offer is coming. Barcelona have had to re-evaluate their recruitment and contracts after CAS upheld their transfer ban until 2016.

Alves, 31, says he will not make a decision on his future until the summer though.

Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis is still weighing up potential moves this month.

L'Equipe reported on Monday that the France international remains unsettled at Swansea despite Wilfried Bony's call-up to the Africa Cup of Nations allowing him more game time.

Crystal Palace have lodged an £8m bid while Leicester, West Ham, Newcastle and Aston Villa have also shown an interest in the 29-year-old. 

Bafetimbi Gomis is looking at a potential  move away from Swansea this season

Millwall have signed Dan Harding on loan from Nottingham Forest. Millwall midfielder Josh Wright is joining Orient. 

Derby have signed Isak Ssewankambo on a free transfer from NAC Breda. The 18-year-old former Chelsea trainee can play right-back or midfield. 

He was part of Chelsea's FA Youth Cup winning side last year. A Sweden U21 international, he has been training with Derby in recent weeks.
