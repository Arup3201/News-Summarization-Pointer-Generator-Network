Beacon booked himself a date at some of the summer’s biggest parties with a rampant performance in the Listed Dragon Stakes at Sandown on Friday.

Ridden by Richard Hughes, the second favourite stalked market rival Mukhmal before the champion jockey gave him the office to quicken four lengths clear.

The win didn’t come as a surprise to delighted trainer Richard Hannon who said: 'I actually put him in the July Stakes at Newmarket next week in case he did something like that.

Winner: Beacon, ridden by Richard Hughes, romps to victory at Sandown on July 4

Powerful: Beacon eased to victory in The Dragon Stakes race on Friday afternoon at Sandown

'It’s a possibility, but he’d have other options like the Molecomb and the Richmond Stakes at Goodwood.'

Fellow trainer Brian Meehan witnessed Mustadeem land the EBF Maiden and immediately issued an enthusiastic briefing about the hot favourite’s future.

'I think he’s a very, very good horse, I’ve thought that all spring,' said Meehan. 'I can see him going on and on.

'He’ll stay seven furlongs for now and I’d thought about the Vintage Stakes at Goodwood, although I’ll have to speak to connections.'

Apprentice Ryan Tate continued his rich vein of form with victory aboard Milly’ s Gift in the Palacegate Touch Handicap.

Tate rode his fourth winner of the week aboard the 8-1 chance and admitted: 'The horses are running well and I should probably be paying to ride them.'
