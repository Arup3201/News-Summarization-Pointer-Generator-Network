The Ice Bucket Challenge phenomenon continues to thrive with  Luis Suarez the latest sportsperson to take the plunge in aid of the charitable cause.

Despite making a move away from Liverpool earlier this summer, the Uruguayan has been far from forgotten with his former team-mate Lucas Leiva nominating him to undertake the challenge.

And Suarez had no hesitations in participating, shortly after challenging another of his former team-mates Martin Skrtel, as well as Nicolás Lodeiro and Martín Cauterucci to step up to the plate next.

Uh oh: Suarez gets ready to undertake the Ice Bucket Challenge

Freezing: Suarez accepted the challenge from former Liverpool team-mate Lucas Leiva

Drenched: Suarez feels the full force of the Ice cold water over his head 

New beginnings; Suarez will look to put all his mistakes behind him when he returns from his ban for Barcelona

Battler: Suarez will wear his heart on his sleeve whenever he turns out for the Catalan giants

So far over £13million has been raised worldwide with the challenge going viral over the past week - all in support of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

Elsewhere, Suarez is currently serving a four month domestic ban as well as a nine-match international suspension for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup.

However, he was able to make his debut for the Catalan giants as a late substitute in a 6-0 friendly victory over Mexican side Club Leon on Monday, after the terms of his ban were reduced.

He is expected to make his competitive debut in a mouthwatering clash against arch-rivals Real Madrid in El Clasico when his ban ends at the end of October.
