Cesc Fabregas has revealed that he is enjoying a 'great moment' at Chelsea as the Spaniard targets Premier League success in his first season with Jose Mourinho's side.

Despite a dip in form in recent weeks, Fabregas has been instrumental to Chelsea's domestic campaign, providing the ammunition for fellow summer signing Diego Costa, who has scored 19 Premier League goals so far this season.

Mourinho's side have earned a six-point gap at the Premier League summit with a game in hand on nearest rivals Manchester City and Fabregas insists he has 'no reason not to be happy'.

He told Spanish newspaper, Marca: 'I am going through a great moment, both personally and athletic. I have no reason not to be happy. I enjoy everything that happens to me.

'I am practically playing every minute for my team and that's what makes me happy. To be important is fundamental. Now we have to fight hard for the Premier League to end a great year.

The former Arsenal captain was an unused substitute during Spain's 1-0 Euro 2016 qualifier victory against the Ukraine on Friday, but Fabregas insists he cares more about the team than his place in the starting XI.

Fabregas added: 'I do not think I've lost my place in the team because I've never been undisputed, the important thing is the team and if the coach does not put you, it is because they are better.'

The 27-year-old midfielder is currently on international duty with Spain, who face Holland on Tuesday
