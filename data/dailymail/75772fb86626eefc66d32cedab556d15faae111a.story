Friends of a teenager found dead in the woods behind her home on Friday night said they wished they had paid more attention to ominous messages she posted online before she vanished.

Hannah Truelove, 16, was reported missing by her mother on Thursday night at 10pm in Gainesville, Georgia. Her body was found on Friday evening and police have described her death as 'violent'.

The girl had mentioned a stalker on her Twitter account and said in another post that she was 'scared'.

Living in fear? Friends said they wished they had paid more attention to the tweets high school student Hannah Truelove, pictured, posted about being stalked

High school student Cristina Robles told ajc.com: 'I didn’t take it seriously. I think I could have helped and talked to her about it and taken it more seriously.'

Her
death was declared a homicide on Monday although cause of death has not
been made public and police were releasing few details.

Detectives did say Truelove appeared to have suffered a
violent death at the hands of someone she knew.

Sgt Kiley Sargent with the Hall 
County Sheriff's Department said that 
authorities don't believe it was a random assault and have information 
that Truelove may have known her attacker.

Police were analyzing the messages as
family and friends were struggling to understand if Truelove had meant 
the tweets to act as a warning.

Tragic: 16-year-old schoolgirl, Hannah Truelove, was found dead in the woods behind her Gainesville home on Friday night; her mother had reported her missing the night before

Her father Jeff Truelove said that his daughter did not show signs of being frightened when he took her on a shopping trip last week.

He told Ajc.com: 'She made no mention of anything to me. But maybe it was one of those things that kids tell to kids.'

He said that he had been teaching his 16-year-old daughter to drive and she had dreams of becoming a veterinarian.

Detectives were going through dozens 
of tips they have received about the schoolgirl to try to determine 
exactly what happened to her.

They were encouraging anyone who might have
information about Truelove to come forward.

Ominous: Detectives are looking into whether the teenager was killed by a stalker; they are asking the girl's friends and family about her tweets including this August 12 post

Investigating: Detectives are trying to make sense of Truelove's posts on Twitter

Sighting: The 16-year-old was last seen sitting at picnic tables near the Lake Lanier Club Apartments, pictured, where she lived with her mother

Neighbors at the apartments saw Hannah sitting at the picnic tables in the complex around 4pm on Thursday while others said she was there as late as 7.30pm. 

The teenager’s body was discovered in
the woods behind the gated complex of the Lake Lanier Club Apartments, 
where she lived with her mother.

Authorities
have classified the schoolgirl’s death as ‘suspicious’ and detectives 
are questioning her family and friends about her eerie tweets.

In the days before her death, the teenager posted a series of cryptic messages on her Twitter account:

August 12, 2.03pm: I got me an uglyass stalker

August 18, 7.23pm:  So scared right now

August 18, 7.38pm: Everytime we talk, I feel sick

August 22, 5.31pm: I need to move out of these dang apartments

On August 12, she posted: ‘I got me an uglyass stalker’ and followed it up with a tweet which read, ‘This can’t be happening…’

The following week, on August 18, she wrote: ‘So scared right now.’

Fours days later, on August 22, the day before she was reported missing, she tweeted: ‘I need to move out of these dang apartments.'

However, many of Truelove's tweets are of song lyrics and sound typical of a teenager going through a break-up.

On Friday night, a grandfather visiting his grandchildren found Truelove’s body as he walked through the woods.

As
investigators continued to follow every tip today, grief counselors 
attended Gainesville High School, where Truelove was a student.

'She had a huge heart. She always put people before herself,' friend Joshua Morrow told Fox News.
