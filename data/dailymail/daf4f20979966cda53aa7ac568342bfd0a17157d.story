OPERATION SEALION by Leo McKinstry (John Murray £25) 

During May 1940, the Nazi blitzkrieg swept through France in a matter of days. Denmark, Norway, Belgium and Holland too were crushed with lightning speed. Britain stood alone against Hitler’s domination of Europe.

The traditional view of what happened next has long been that we were saved only by the superiority of the RAF’s Spitfires and Hurricanes to the Luftwaffe’s Messerschmitts, and the gallantry of the men who flew them.

If we had lost the Battle of Britain, all that stood between us and a fascist future was the Home Guard, a Dad’s Army of oldsters armed with broomsticks.

Leo McKinstry’s engrossing, forensic review of the evidence challenges that idea and exposes some myths along the way.

Not only was Britain well armed and prepared, but the Germans weren’t very eager to invade us anyway.

At the time France fell and the British Expeditionary Force scrambled its way home from Dunkirk, there was no German plan to invade Britain.

Hitler, a huge admirer of the British Empire and the way it was run, expected us to seek peace terms.

And there were plenty this side of the Channel who wanted to, especially some Tory members of the coalition government, led by Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax.

Of course, Winston Churchill was fiercely opposed to any settlement, and his stance held sway with the support of Labour and Liberal members of the government.

Faced with Britain’s defiance, Hitler himself disagreed with some of his military staff, who were eager to continue the momentum across Europe and finish the job.

He had no interest in naval warfare and believed that, isolated from imports by a U-boat cordon, Britain would be worn down until she made terms.

25,000 Londoners were made homeless in the first two weeks of the Blitz 

There were good military reasons for his caution, too.

Mostly there was the Royal Navy, the mightiest sea force in the world with ten times as many ships as the Germans had and the right ones too, 13 battleships to their two, 169 destroyers to their ten.

Even if Germany succeeded in attaining air superiority, it would be risky to take hundreds of troop-carrying craft across the notoriously choppy English Channel while under fire from our ships.

To put the difficulty into context, going the other way, four years later, the Allies took two years planning and rehearsing D-Day, had massive air and sea superiority and even then only just made it.

Churchill himself was sceptical about the threat of invasion. And contrary to myth, Britain was well prepared.

British factories were turning out fighter planes faster than the Germans, with nearly 500 being produced in July alone.

And we had a massive army. By mid-July we had 1,300,000 regular troops, plus 600,000 Local Defence Volunteers — later renamed the Home Guard by Churchill. While it’s true the latter included at least one man as old as Dad’s Army’s Corporal Jones, the average age was actually 35.

Rather than being a bunch of well-meaning duffers led by pompous twits, most were former servicemen with sound military knowledge.

And although they initially had no weapons and trained with broomsticks, they were soon well equipped with 615,000 rifles from the U.S.

All in all, they could have put up a decent fight.

It’s also a mistake to forget the stunningly efficient way that countless pillboxes and other defences were thrown up around the country. Unfortunately, this fed paranoid rumours that the invasion was imminent.

One rumour — repeated in Dad’s Army — claimed that a force of Germans dressed as nuns was spreading across the country, although they could be detected by their hairy forearms.

It was also feared German paratroopers might land dressed in British uniforms taken from men who had been captured at Dunkirk.

General Montgomery advised that the simplest way to rumble them was to make them take off their helmets — as ‘the very marked square-head of the Teuton can easily be recognised’.

In mid-July, smarting under English insults, Hitler finally gave the go-ahead for the invasion, codenamed Operation Sealion.

As it was considered an impos-sible undertaking beyond mid-September because of worsening weather, he gave his underlings a month to prepare.

It was a logistical nightmare. The Germans possessed no landing craft, troop carriers that could be driven right up onto a beach.

They rapidly began amassing a collection of barges and other commercial boats from all over Europe, 1,910 in total, plus 419 tugs to tow them.

As the tugs couldn’t pull them right to the shore, the men would have to jump out in deep water and wade to land under fire.

Post-invasion plans included taking all able-bodied Britons aged 17-45 to Germany as slave labour, and Nelson’s column to Berlin. But it was all pie in the sky.

The RAF began making raids on the assembling invasion force, damaging 12 per cent of it, a demonstration of what might happen to an actual attempt.

The Royal Navy attacked German ships in port, while back home the security forces proved remarkably adept at rounding up German spies.

After a bombastic speech on September 4 that an invasion was imminent, Hitler again began to have cold feet.

The finalenail in the coffin was September 15, Battle of Britain Day, when the RAF downed 60 German fighters, for a loss of 26.

Clearly Germany did not command the skies.

Two days later, the Fuhrer announced that Operation Sealion was postponed and the fleet began dispersing because of RAF bombing attacks.

It proved the end of Sealion, as Hitler’s attention turned East and Operation Barbarossa, the attack on Russia the following year.

Far from being a sitting duck, Britain — even at its loneliest and most exposed — had proved too dangerous and formidable a foe for the Nazis to tackle head-on.

In our self-deprecating way, we rather forget how ruthless and proficient our preparations against invasion actually were and tend to treat this particular chapter of our national story almost as a joke.

McKinstry’s admirable book sets the record straight.
