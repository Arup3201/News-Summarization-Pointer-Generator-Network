George Groves was in confident mood on the morning of his eagerly-awaited rematch with IBF and WBA super-middleweight champion Carl Froch by sending his opponent a taunting tweet.

Groves tweeted: 'No more sleeps @Carl_Froch #TickTock' as he continued his provocative lead up to the Battle of Britain.

Many believe the Londoner overstepped the mark with his trash talking during the weigh-in when he said that Froch was 'a man on death row'.

To which the champion replied: 'I want to send him back into the hole he crawled out of and put this saga behind me'.

Groves' comments, made in front of 4,000 boisterous fans, have not gone unnoticed by the Boxing Board of Control.

Fighting talk: George Groves taunts Carl Froch on the morning of their eagerly-awaited rematch

Job done: Carl Froch and George Groves both made weight ahead of their rematch on Saturday

Face to face: Froch did the talking as both men came together for the final time before the first bell

General Secretary Robert Smith said: 
'It was a silly thing to say. We know that boxers sometimes say silly 
things as a fight nears but this was unfortunate.

'It
 is not appropriate to talk in terms of death in relation to this very 
hard game of ours because unfortunately death sometimes happens.

'We
 won't do anything about this until the fight is over but we will have a
 think next week as to whether to have a word with George.'

Froch was reprimanded by the Board after threatening to kill Mikkel Kessler before their rematch.

The
 Nottingham Cobra, who is defending his world super-middleweight titles 
in front of a Wembley crowd of 80,000, was booed and jeered as he took 
to the scales by a predominantly London crowd in the nearby Arena.

Surprisingly, given that he is naturally the heavier man, Groves came in 1lb 4oz lighter than Froch.

No worries: Groves looked confident as he weighed in well within the 12st limit at Wembley Arena

Inside: Froch weighed in just within the limit to ensure the rematch goes ahead on Saturday nightÂ 

The
 Cobra said to The Saint as they posed for the eyeball-to-eyeball 
photographs: 'You look drawn and dehydrated. You've come in under 
weight.'

Later, Froch said: 
'He looks to me like he has put himself under pressure by saying he'll 
knock me out in three rounds. Very nervous, if you ask me.'

Groves responded by saying: 'I did the weight comfortably, we wanted to moan about the 4pm weigh-in for the sake of moaning.

Business time: The trash talk will stop between Froch and Groves when they go toe-to-toe at Wembley

Cheeky to cheeky: Both Brits try to show they're relaxed ahead of the super middleweight world title bout

'I feel perfect in mind, body and soul. I couldn't be more ready.

'Carl needs reassurance but he can't find it and for that reason he's going to struggle. I'd beat Carl Froch every night of the week.'

Groves weighed 1lb 10oz under the 12st limit, while Froch scaled 11st 13lb 9oz.

The
 closest we came to drama was when one of Groves' sizeable contingent of
 bodyguards engaged in a brief scuffle with an official security man.
