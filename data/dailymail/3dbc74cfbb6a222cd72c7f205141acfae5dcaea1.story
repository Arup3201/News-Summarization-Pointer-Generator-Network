The UK's freak weather has whipped-up its greatest shock yet - after a walker claimed to have spotted a penguin on a British beach.

Stunned Chantelle Smith, 25, was strolling along Polkerris Beach in Cornwall when she spotted the black and white bird.

She managed to get her phone out just in time to take a picture of the mysterious bird waddling along the sands.

P-p-pick up a penguin at Polkerris beach: Chantelle Smith snapped this image of what she believes is a penguin

Chantelle, of St Blazey in Cornwall, said she believes the creature was a penguin - normally found in Antarctica.

She said: 'I was with a friend walking over to the harbour and I saw it run past.

'At first I thought it was just a rabbit but when I turned on the torch of my phone to have a look I could see it was a penguin - an actual penguin.

'It sat there for ages and I managed to get quite close and take the picture and then ran off. I was just shocked.

'I
 thought 'that can't be a penguin' but it definitely looked like a 
penguin. Everybody I have told thinks I am crazy but I am being honest. I
 am going to call it Pingu.'

Penguins are aquatic, flightless birds, which usually live in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly Antarctica.

But experts say it could be a case of mistaken identity as guillemots and razorbills are similar in appearance when they walk.

Stewart Muir, director of Newquay Zoo said: 'I can almost certainly tell you what it is and it's not the first time this has happened.

'We have had this before over many years. When Guillemots and Razorbills stand up they look like little penguins.

'They can give a fair impression under water as well as they can swim at great speed using their short wings.'

The alleged penguin's appearance came as a seal swam 20 miles inland into the country market town of Monmouth in Wales after the river Wye burst its banks in the storms.
