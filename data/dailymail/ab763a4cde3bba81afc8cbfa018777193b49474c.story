Who should replace Moyes at Man United?

David Moyes will receive no more than £5million in compensation after being sacked by Manchester United due to a clause in his contract.

The former Everton boss lasted just 10 months of his six-year contract and, as a result of a terrible season for last year's Premier League winners, Moyes will be feeling the financial effect.

An 'ejector seat' clause in his contract, inserted in case United failed to qualify for the Champions League next season, limits his compensation to no more than 12 months of salary.

End of the line: Moyes lasted just 10 months of his six-year contract having been appointed last summer

I'm done: David Moyes was relieved of his duties as Manchester United manager on Tuesday

Confirmation: Manchester United released a short statement on Twitter

Early morning meeting: United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward delivered the news face-to-face

The Scot 
was relieved of his duties by chief executive Ed Woodward at an early 
morning meeting at the club's Carrington training ground on Tuesday with more than five years left on his £5m-a-year deal.

Moyes has overseen the club's worst ever Premier League season, and Old Trafford bosses decided enough was enough after a dire 2-0 defeat by Everton on Sunday.

Ryan Giggs took over as interim boss until the end of the season, and Louis Van Gaal is among the leading candidates to be in the hot seat at the start of the next campaign.

Bright beginnings: Moyes started work at Old Trafford on July 1 last summer just 10 months ago
