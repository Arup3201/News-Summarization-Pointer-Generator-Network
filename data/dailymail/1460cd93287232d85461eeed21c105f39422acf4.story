Inverall public school teacher Cara Harding, who died in a light plane crash in northern NSW, has been described as having a great impact on her young students' lives.

Ms Harding, 46, died with burns to 70 per cent of her body at Sydney's Royal North Shore Hospital on Saturday morning, and her husband Dr Mark Harding, 52, who was flying the plane, remains in a critical condition. While the couple's 13-year-old daughter suffered burns to her legs when the family was on their way to Brisbane for a holiday on Friday.

Inverell mayor Paul Harmon, said the entire community was grieving over the well-respected teacher.

'She was a valued member of the school staff, you know, having an impact on lots of young people's lives," he told the Seven Network. 'She certainly is going to be missed. It's very sad.'

Ms Harding who died after her family's Cessna 210 aircraft crashed shortly after taking off from Inverell Airport, northern NSW, has been remembered as an inspirational teacher by the Inverell community  

The Cessna 210 aircraft burst into flames after getting into trouble shortly after take-off from Inverell Airport on Friday. The plane came down next to the Clive State Forest just after 1pm.

Witnesses reported hearing the plane's engine cough and splutter before it crashed just short of the runway.

'I was driving home and we saw something, it was like a pebble skipping across the water ... and then it came to a standstill,' witness Jade Olds told the Illwarra Mercury.

'There was a man who just stopped dead in the road and then he just ripped his shirt off and pulled people out of the plane.

'I just saw them getting taken out of the plane – it didn't look pretty ... and then the plane just went ka-boom and there was fire everywhere.'

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is investigating and police are preparing a report for the coroner.
