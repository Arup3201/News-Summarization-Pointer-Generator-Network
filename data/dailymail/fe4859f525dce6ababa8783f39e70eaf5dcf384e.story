A civilian crew damaged a $1.5 billion 27,000 tonne warship to be known as HMAS Canberra, when they took it out on a test cruise between Sydney and Melbourne, it has been reported.

The hull of the Landing Helicopter Dock was damaged and its electrical systems melted down during the ship’s first 'shakedown cruise', which tests a ship’s performance before it enters service.

The crew from Teekay Shipping Corporation who crewed the vessel encountered two problems, both of which were the result of user error, reported The Daily Telegraph.

The HMAS Canberra had an electrical meltdown and had its hull damaged during a test voyage by a civilian crew

A source said the first issue occurred when the electric powered pods at the stern of the ship were operated independently in low-speed mode when the ship was travelling at high speed, when they should have been operated in tandem, which caused serious vibrations across the ship.

A source told The Daily Telegraph: 'It was like the shaking floor in an amusement park house of fun.

'Once the pods were back in the correct mode the vibration ceased.'

The vibration caused paint to be stripped form the ship’s hull, though damage was minimal.

Both issues were the result of user error and occurred during a 'shakedown cruise' from Sydney to Melbourne in May

The vessel is the first of the two Landing Helicopter Docks that are being built for the Australian Navy. The HMAS Canberra should be commissioned later in the year

Length: 230.82 m

Displacement: 27,500 tonnes

Speed: Maximum of 20 knots

Carrying capacity: Up to 110 vehicles, 1,600 troops

Cost to build: $1.5 billion each

The HMAS Canberra is one of two Landing Helicopter Dock ships being built for the Royal Australian Navy, the other, the HMAS Adelaide is still being fitted out.

The will be the largest vessels ever operated by the RAN.

They will likely be operated out of Townsville in Queensland.

The HMAS Canberra also reportedly suffered an electrical power failure when the crew forgot to disconnect the emergency power, resulting in the circuit breakers melting.

The error resulted in the vessel losing steerage and forced the crew to drop anchor for four hours.

The source told The Daily Telegraph that 'There were no major design errors during the trials and both issues were operator errors.'

A spokesperson for Teekay Shipping Australia, who supplied the crew for the sea trial denied the claims that any problems occurred during the sea trial due to user error.

'[C]laims that the hull of the HMAS Canberra was damaged and that an electrical system melted down are fallacious,' he said.

'The claim that Teekay seastaff were negligent resulting in damage to the vessel is completely false.'

The Canberra is the first of two Landing Helicopter Docks being built for the Australian navy.

Other problems detected during the shakedown cruise were corrosion in propeller nuts and a small crack in the hull of the ship, caused by the long barge journey made by the ship from Spain, where it was built.

The next round of sea trials for the ship will be in July and she is due to be handed to the navy later this year.

Guided Missile Frigate – A long-range escort ship, with air defence, anti-submarine warfare, surveillance, interdiction and reconnaissance. Four in commission.

Frigate Helicopter – A long-range escort ship with helicopter landing facilities. Eight in commission.

Patrol Boat – These ships are named after cities and towns with close links with Navy heritage. They have attack capabilities, as well as the abilitiy to intercept and apprehend vessels. 14 in commission.

Minehunter Coastal – Has excellent shock resistance and sonar capable of detecting mines underwater. Six in commission.

Landing Ship, Heavy – A multi-purpose troop and heavy vehicle carrier with facilities for helicopter landing. Able to carry the heaviest load of all carriers. One in commission.

Landing Ship, Dock – These have a large flight deck and the ability to load and transport large number of troops and heavy vehicles. One in commission.

Landing Craft, Heavy – These vessels are able to move large amounts of cargo, personnel and equipment from larger ships to shore. Three in commission.

Surveying ship – These produce nautical charts of the earth’s surface, which is particularly important, as around Australia, less than half of the area has been surveyed to acceptable standards, making ocean travel more dangerous. Two in commission.

Surveying Ship, Coastal – These ships perform surveying work, but in shallower and more constrained waters, particularly around the water of northern Australia. Four in commission.

Support Ship – These replenishment oilers have fuel tanks and dry cargo holds and can replenish other ships while underway on the high seas. Two in commission.

Submarines – These guided missile submarines move almost silently, and have a sophisticated combat system. Six in commission.

Ancillary craft – Various craft include landing craft, inflatable boats, a light utility boat and a ceremonial Admiral’s Barge.
