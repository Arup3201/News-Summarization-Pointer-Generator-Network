When Sam Sheppard's boyfriend Ryan proposed to her it was, she says, more like 'being asked out for pizza'.

So disappointing was this pivotal life moment that Sam decided to ensure no other women were ever let down in such a way again.

So the 34-year-old from Gilwen, Monmouthshire, made it her mission to train men in the art of popping the question, founding The Proposal Expert, Wales' first bespoke wedding proposal planning service.

Catering for clients with any budget - from £10 to £10,000 - Sam has already helped couples all over the UK get engaged, and boasts a 100 per cent success rate.

She said: 'The idea came from my own disappointing experience - my boyfriend, Ryan Galeozzi, proposed to me during an argument in the same way you might ask someone if they'd like to go for a pizza.

'When he proposed I didn't even realise what he was asking. He said he spent too long looking and planning and in the end he just blurted it out.

'At the time I thought it was because
 he didn't care enough to put any effort into it, but once he explained I
 realised I was being silly. He said he wants to have another go, so now I'm just waiting.'

You have got to be kidding: Sam doesn't want other women to be as let down as she was when their boyfriend's finally pop the question

She said: 'I want to help other people not to feel how I felt. Initially, I felt like he couldn't really care about me to have asked that way, though of course I know that's not true at all.'

Sam spends up to three weeks planning the perfect way for the prospective groom - or bride - to propose.

The client can choose from a number 
of packages, ranging from an bespoke ideas consultation costing under 
£100, to a full proposal planning service, where Sam organises every 
aspect of the proposal, including negotiating a discount with venues and
 vendors and handling payments.

Sam added: 'I ask key questions to put together the pieces of the puzzle - what makes their partner laugh, how they spend their Saturday mornings - those little things build up a picture.

'Once we've got the idea, the proposer can then have as much or as little input as they like.'

Be mine? Ryan and Sam have been together for four years, but Ryan says he is planning to propose all over again because Sam was so disappointed by his first attempt

Clients can even choose to have their proposal recorded or photographed with a paparazzi-style lens.

Sam said: 'A lot of guys use Google for ideas and end up with something generic. They can become overwhelmed and a little bit paralysed with it.

'A good proposal can be lasting talking point, but a bad one can end up on YouTube for the whole world to see.

'I haven't heard any really wacky ideas yet - unless your partner is really wacky too those are best avoided.'

Say cheese! Sam caters for clients with any budget, from £10 to £10,000, and says she builds up a picture of the couple and their relationship before putting together their 'proposal package'

Sam's research has shown that most women prefer to be asked while their partner is on bended knee, and that a treasure hunt proposal is the most fail-safe option - just so long as it has been personalised to the couple.

Sam, whose background is in marketing and teaching English, believes her creative flair and organisation have helped her to become The Proposal Expert.

She said: 'A lot of my friends are male which has helped me to know how they think and what makes them tick.

'I know that they need help with this sort of thing and I'm here to give it to them. I can give them a female's perspective and they don't have to worry about being judged by their friends - or their girlfriend finding out. I offer absolute discretion.

Meet the expert: 'This is a huge industry in America and the guys there are proud to have used a proposal planner. Their fiances usually love that they've used one too'

Sam admits that most men she has helped choose not to tell the bride-to-be that they've used her services, but she believes that will change.

'This is a huge industry in America and the guys there are proud to have used a proposal planner,' she said. 'Their fiances usually love that they've used one too.

'Everything the man says is what helps me to put the idea together - so whatever package they choose they still play a big part.'
