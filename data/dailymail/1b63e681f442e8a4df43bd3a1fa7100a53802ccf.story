Fake Disney clothes worth £10,000 which feature characters from Oscar-winning animation Frozen have been seized by Border Force officers at Stansted Airport.

The children's dresses and bags - which were destined for the streets of the UK - will be destroyed after Disney confirmed they were fake.

More than 490 dresses and three bags carrying images of the popular Disney film were discovered by officers after they arrived in Essex from China earlier this month.

Border Force's International Trade Team - which specialises in recognising counterfeit products and works with the owners of big brands - has now launched an  investigation.

Disney can now decide whether or not they wish to prosecute the importer privately.

James Morgan, Assistant Director in charge of Border Force at Stansted, said: 'Everyone loves a bargain, but if the price appears too good to be true – either at a car boot sale, a market stall or online – it probably is.

'The international trade in counterfeit goods is linked to serious and organised crime and undercuts honest traders, damaging our economy.

Frozen has become the fifth highest-grossing film in box office history after taking £723million worldwide

He added: 'We are determined to crack down on this crime and we have officers working 24 hours a day at ports, airports and mail sorting centres identifying counterfeit goods before they reach the streets.

'Members of the public can also help to disrupt this trade by ensuring they only buy from genuine retailers.

Frozen has become the fifth highest-grossing film in box office history after taking £723million worldwide with hits songs 'Let It Go' and 'For the First Time in Forever'.

Anyone who has been sold counterfeit goods or knows someone who is selling them should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.
