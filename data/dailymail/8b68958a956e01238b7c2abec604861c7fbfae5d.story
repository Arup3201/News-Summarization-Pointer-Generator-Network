Fernando is edging closer to sealing a move to Manchester City and should see his Premier League switch ratified this week.

The Porto defensive midfielder is on the verge of a £14.5million transfer to the Etihad Stadium.

Manuel Pellegrini failed in a bid to sign the 26-year-old in January, but has gone back in with another bid that looks to have lured the Brazilian away from Portugal.

Edging: Porto's central midfielder Fernando is close to sealing a £14.5m move to Manchester City

Options please! Manager Manuel Pellegrini wants added strength alongside Yaya Toure in City's midfield

Fernando's agent Antonio Araujo is confident the deal can be sorted imminently.

'Everything is in Porto's hands and we hope to finalise the transfer by the end of the week,' he said.

'Fernando is in the city of Porto waiting for Porto tell him their decision about the documents they have received so that he can travel immediately [to Manchester].'

Fernando isn't with the Brazil squad for this month's World Cup and is yet to win a senior international cap.

He is, however, seen as decent value for money after impressing for Porto over a number of seasons.

Pellegrini is on the hunt for a new midfielder after finding himself short on options alongside Yaya Toure if Fernandinho was unavailable. While Javi Garcia performed admirably, City need further strength in depth if they are to challenge in the Champions League.
