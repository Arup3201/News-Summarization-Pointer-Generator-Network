Lisa Ling has shared a pictured of her daughter while she updated her former co-hosts on The View about her life.

The reporter chose an intimate snap of her now-1-year-old daughter Jett lying in between she and her husband Paul Song.

During the reunion episode of The View this morning, Ling credited Barbara Walters for reminding her to take care of her professional life and not just focus on her career.

'Your best advice that you ever gave me was don’t neglect your personal life because I'm someone who is a bit of an over-achiever and working all the time,' Ling said to Walters during the legendary journalist's penultimate episode.

‘My daughter Jett has just changed our lives in such a profound way. And she is my husband's doppelganger, she looks just like him- they have the same hair when they wake up in the morning.’

Ling was 26-years-old when she chosen from an estimated 12,000 young women who applied to be the new View co-host in 1999 after Debbie Matenopoulos left the show.

Showing the maternal role that she took towards her younger colleague, Walters said: 'I thought you'd never get married!'

'I wanted you to get married. I didn't want you to neglect your personal life,' the 84-year-old said on Thursday.

Ling married Paul Song, an oncologist, in May 2007, five years after leaving the morning show.

While she was pregnant with Jett, she opened up to Anderson Cooper telling how she was nervous throughout the pregnancy because she had suffered a miscarriage two years earlier.

She said: 'I was trying to keep [my pregnancy] quiet for a long time, but I'm starting to get to the point where it looks like I have this really big beer belly.

'I figured I'd better share it publicly.'

'I just felt like such an incredible failure and I felt so alone when it happened,' she told Cooper of the miscarriage.

'I wasn't ready to tell any of my friends about it. I jumped online, I started pouring through blogs... Once I did start talking to friends, I realised that it's so pervasive. Almost every one of my friends has had one at one time or another but nobody talks about it.'

Her decision to go public with her pregnancy on Cooper's show only came out of necessity, as she said that she was 'starting to get to the point where it looks like I have this really big beer belly.'

Aside from starting a family, Ling has continued to dedicate time to her career since leaving The view, opting to focus on international reporting with a series of documentary reporting projects.

Ling, now 40, has her own documentary series called 'Our America with Lisa Ling' on Oprah Winfrey's network.

The all-female cast was reunited in a way they'd never been before with every co-host from the show's 17 seasons joined together at an extra large table
