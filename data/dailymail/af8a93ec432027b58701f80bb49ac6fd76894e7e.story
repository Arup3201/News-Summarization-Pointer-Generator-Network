Devotion: Terminally ill Scott Nagy gave his daughter Samantha away at an Ohio church on Saturday on his hospital bed

A terminally ill man who arrived at his daughter's wedding by ambulance took her down the aisle - on a hospital bed.

Guests cried and clapped as Scott Nagy, gripped by cancer, gave his daughter Sarah away on Saturday at First Evangelical Lutheran Church in Strongsville, Ohio.

A volunteer team of medical professionals helped Nagy escort the 24-year-old bride as groom Angelo Salvatore and the Rev. Chuck Knerem awaited their arrival.

'It
was a promise I made in March, to walk her down the aisle,' the 
56-year-old Brunswick man said.

'She's my princess. This is my definition of 
walking down the aisle.'

Nagy
was diagnosed with urethral cancer in November and has undergone 
chemotherapy.

He has been at University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 
since August.

He reportedly has just 'weeks to months' to live.

Doctors 
were uncertain if he would be able to make the wedding, initially 
scheduled for next year.

But with monitor cords slipped under his tuxedo
and a tracheal tube attached, he made the trip down the aisle, kissing a
grandson who was the ring bearer and giving a thumb's up.

Lying raised up on the gurney that
carried him from the hospital, he escorted Sarah to the altar to meet her groom.

Fulfilling his promise: Sarah Nagy was given away by her father Scott, 56 on her wedding day at First Lutheran Church in Strongsville, Ohio, on Saturday

'Somehow everything just fell into place
for this date,' Nagy's wife, Jean, told cleveland.com.

'It's almost like it was just meant to be. 
The first night at the hospital, Scott said, 'Just remember, I have to 
be at my daughter's wedding in October.' He was a big part of this. He 
was at the bridal shower. He went shopping for her dress. There was no 
way he was not going to finish this out.'

Jacky
Uljanic, a nurse practitioner with the hospital, helped make the 
arrangements for Nagy to attend the wedding.

She put him through daily 
therapy to build up his strength and she checked on the logistics in 
advance.

Physicians Medical Transport donated the ambulance trip, and a 
doctor and other medical personnel accompanied Nagy on the ride.

Sarah
said that since she was a little girl, she has wanted her father to 
escort her down the aisle when she married. The Brunswick High School teacher said her future husband 
assured her she would get her wish.

'But it is what I wanted since I was a 
little girl, for my father to escort me down the aisle. My future 
husband said, 'You will get your wish',' she told cleveland.com.

At the vestibule, she burst into tears and told her father she loved him.

'We did it,' Nagy said to her and reminded her not to streak her makeup.

He stayed to the end of the afternoon 
service, watching from the back of the church.

Nagy was too sick to attend the reception, so he delivered the traditional toast via 
Skype from his hospital bed.
