A Costa Concordia crew member has told a court how she was ordered to tell passengers 'everything was under control' after the packed luxury cruise ship struck rocks and was fatally holed.

Jacqueline Abad Quine was a deputy cabin services director and was on duty the night the ship hit the reefs after its captain Francesco Schettino altered course to carry out a 'sail-by salute' of an island.

She was later seen in video footage trying to reassure passengers who had gathered on decks close to lifeboat stations and described to the hearing the scene of panic and confusion in the minutes following the incident.

Mrs Quine said: 'I was ordered to 
tell the passengers everything was under control. I was told to say that
 there was a blackout and everyone should return to their cabins and 
that things would be returning to normal as quickly as possible.

'But
 people were agitated and worried - they wanted to get onto the 
lifeboats but the order didn't come. When the passengers got to the 
muster stations I was told to try and calm them down, to reassure them.'

More
 than 4,000 passengers and crew - including 35 Britons - were onboard 
the Costa Concordia when it struck an underwater reef off the coast of 
the Italian island of Giglio just hours after setting sail on a 
seven-day Mediterranean cruise in January last year.

Mrs
 Quine broke down in tears as she told the hearing in the Italian town 
of Grosseto: 'I made announcements in English, Spanish and Italian. I 
called my boss and he said the crew were frightening the passengers with
 what they were saying.

'Children
 were hugging their parents, two little ones lost and a were trying to 
find them. Reliving everything again now is really hard for me now. The
 passengers wanted to get onboard the lifeboats.

'They
 were pushing each other, trying to get on but we didn't have the order 
to let them get onboard. I had to tell everyone that there was an 
electrical problem and everything was going to return to normal.

'Eventually
 the order to abandon ship came from the second officer - I made a human
 chain with others to get onto a lifeboat and there must have been 
around 150 people in it.

'When
 I looked back the ship had capsized. Everyone on the lifeboat was so 
scared and so was I. I prayed to God for help asking him to help us and 
to help me so that I knew what to tell the passengers.'

Schettino,
 who was dubbed Captain Coward after the incident, is accused of 
multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning the Costa 
Concordia while passengers and crew were still onboard.

Previously
 the court has heard how he ended up in a lifeboat ahead of others and 
at the time of the disaster a tape recording emerged of him being 
ordered to get back onto the ship by lifeguard officials, but he 
refused.

Thirty-two 
people died in the disaster and last week the remains of one of two 
people missing, a Sicilian woman, were positively identified and she was
 finally buried.

A 
waiter, Russel Rebello, is still missing and his remains have yet to be 
discovered. The ship was straightened two months ago and has been made 
secure for the winter, ahead of being towed to a dry dock on the 
mainland next year where she will be scrapped.

Later
 Francesco Raccomandato, cabin services director, told the court: 'I did
 not tell my assistant to tell passengers to return to their cabins.

'I
 said that as it was dangerous to remain at the muster stations I 
suggested it was better people grouped in the lounges and that they 
should get warm clothing and any medication needed.'

Salvage operators in Italy lifted the Costa Concordia cruise ship upright from its watery grave off the island of Giglio in September, in the biggest ever project of its kind. It will soon be scrapped

He added: 'I did eventually speak to Captain Schettino and asked him what we should tell the passengers was happening, and he said "just say it's a blackout and we are working on it".'

Mr Raccomandato went on: 'He said that we should also tell everyone to "keep calm".'

During a break in proceedings, Schettino's lawyer Domenico Pepe also denied that the order to tell passengers to return to their cabins had come from his client and he said: 'Maybe it came from another member of the crew.

'We hope only that among the victims are people who returned to their cabins as a result of this order which I stress again did not come from the captain.'

Schettino has insisted that his actions in fact saved lives and by turning the vessel around and bringing the ship virtually to the entrance of Giglio harbour he in fact 'saved thousands of lives'.

The trial is not expected to finish until later next year and prosecutors are looking for a 20 year jail sentence against Schettino.

A cadet officer told the trial previously that the captain did not 'slip into a lifeboat' as he claimed - but leaped onto one while stricken passengers and crew were still on board.

Stefano
 Iannelli said: 'I jumped onto the roof [of a lifeboat] but Schettino 
was already there, he had jumped just before me. As soon as the lifeboat launched, the ship rolled and the deck where we had been was submerged. We picked up passengers who were in the water as we headed to the shore.'

While the rescue was ongoing and Schettino was in the lifeboat, in a widely reported telephone call that was leaked to the media, coastguard chief Gregorio De Falco can be heard ordering him: 'Get back on board, for f***'s sake.'

Schettino refused to do so and instead he made his way to a hotel on the island, where he waited for officials to arrive. He was later taken away to the mainland where he was arrested and ultimately charged.

Prosecutors say Schettino deliberately altered the course of the Concordia so that he could carry out the sail-by salute of Giglio to impress passengers and islanders, passing fatally close to the reef.

The disaster happened on January 13 last year, just hours after the Costa Concordia had left the port of Civitavecchia for a seven-day Mediterranean cruise. Among those on board were 35 British passengers and crew.
