At the time they were taken television fame may have seemed light years away, but these pictures show that Doctor Who star Matt Smith was always destined  for success.

The future Time Lord is seen aged 17 in a school production taking on the demanding role of doomed 12th Century archbishop Thomas Becket – the murder of whom King Henry is said to have inspired with his outburst: Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?

But despite the young Smith already displaying remarkable stage presence, his teachers at Northampton School for Boys reveal he was a reluctant star.

Smith, seen in another school production, had to be persuaded he was good enough to make acting his career, according to his former drama teacher

Former headteacher Rod Goldswain said: ‘As soon as Matt stepped on the stage the audience were enthralled, but it took quite a bit of convincing from his drama teacher to get him to take part.

‘What particularly sticks out in my mind was his performance in the Pirates Of Penzance. He was 16, playing the Pirate King, and strolling around the stage ad-libbing with the audience. It was fantastic.’

Smith, now 30 – who returned to our screens as the 11th Doctor last night – also had school roles in West Side Story and Twelve Angry Men.

His former drama teacher, Jerry Hardingham, said: ‘Matt is one of the only students that we have ever had to persuade to believe he could be an actor and that he should consider it as a career.

Smith's performance as The Pirate King in the Pirates of Penzance stuck in the mind of former headteacher Rod Goldswain

'He was always so self-effacing that he was not sure if he would be good enough. His success is no surprise.’

Mr Goldswain recalled how Smith was chosen to give a speech during a school visit by film producer David Puttnam.

‘Matt and David got on so well that they ended up swapping numbers and kept in touch,’ he said.

‘Even at that age, Matt clearly had presence and you couldn’t take your eyes off him when he was on stage.’
