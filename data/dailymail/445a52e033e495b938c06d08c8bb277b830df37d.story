He stepped off the plane in Tallinn very much the Plan B and, despite Adam Lallana's best efforts, he will fly home as the Plan B as well.

It's not that Lallana did a great deal wrong in England's underwhelming 1-0 win over Estonia, but when Roy Hodgson resorts to bringing on a player who before the match declared himself fatigued to provide the spark it doesn't bode too well.

The 'tired one' was Lallana's Liverpool accomplice Raheem Sterling and with an uninspiring England trying to break down 10-men Estonia after the hour mark, he was summoned from the bench to offer a much-needed injection of pace.

Lallana is not without speed but he simply can't muster the raw acceleration that Sterling can when needs must.

He had impressed for much of the first-half but faded a little after the break and fresh legs were definitely required to lift England to the victory that maintained their perfect start to Euro 2016 qualification.

Tiredness eventually catches up with even 19-year-olds and Sterling, who has been carrying a heavy burden of expectation for both club and country this season, felt it necessary to tell Hodgson on the eve of the match that he was suffering the effects.

Sterling, who was taken off at half-time in Thursday's rout of San Marino with the more demanding trip to the Baltics in mind, had very much been Hodgson's Plan A and the England system had been tweaked accordingly.

But instead of him, it was Lallana who took position at the top of a midfield diamond behind frontmen Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck.

The early signs were encouraging, with Lallana, bold and direct, at the centre of every England attack.

He hustled and harried, forcing Artur Pikk into a mistake before rampaging across the box and firing off a shot that was blocked.

The link-up play with Rooney was intuitive and the captain automatically tried to locate Lallana's intelligent runs during the opening stages.

On the quarter-hour, Lallana, having dropped deep again to retrieve possession, found space with a smart flick over his own head before attemptin to find Fabian Delph.

Lallana, who had been one of England's few bright sparks at the World Cup in Brazil, featuring in all three matches, looked perfectly at home in the advanced role.

He was close to turning in a deflected Welbeck cross and then forced a save from goalkeeper Sergei Pareiko at his near post. 

He recovered the ball on 10 occasions and recorded a passing accuracy of 87.5 per cent, which certainly isn't to be sniffed at. Tellingly, though, he directly didn't create a chance all night. 

The longer England hammered away at the densely-packed Estonia defence without reward, the more his influence waned.

The win kept England top of Group E with maximum points from their three matches so far

England had dominated proceedings, enjoying as much as 75 per cent of the ball, and the balance shifted further in their favour when Estonia captain Ragnar Klavan was sent off for brutally stopping Delph's storming run just two minutes into the second-half.

With more space to exploit and Estonian legs tiring, England were screaming out for extra pace to take advantage.

Lallana, unfortunately, wasn't the man to provide it and Hodgson wisely moved to bring on first Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and then Sterling.

There were a few eyebrows raised by the fact Sterling had felt unable to start the match but was now required to rescue it.

But whatever his condition, the introduction of the two speedsters gave England the impetus they needed. Rooney curled home the decisive free-kick and England take another step closer to France the year after next.

Lallana does provide an exciting option for England. It's just that Sterling at the moment offers a little bit more.
