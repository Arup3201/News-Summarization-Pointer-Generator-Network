A violinist who killed herself days after testifying against her 'predatory' former choirmaster told her husband she felt she had been the one on trial, an inquest was told.

Frances Andrade, 48, died at her home in Guildford, Surrey in January last year, just a week after giving evidence in court about historic sexual abuse by music teacher Michael Brewer.

Woking Coroner's Court heard the mother-of-four had spiralled into 'incredible despair' after a friend reported Brewer to Surrey Police the previous January and she was asked to give a statement.

Brewer, who taught at the prestigious Chetham's School of Music in Manchester before going on to direct the World Youth Choir, was later stripped of his OBE for services to music after being jailed for six years for five counts of indecent assault.  His ex-wife, Hilary Kay Brewer, was also jailed for sexual abuse.

Mrs Andrade was just 14 and 15 when the abuse happened, but only came forward when she confided in a friend at a dinner party in 2011 and was alarmed that Brewer was still teaching.

The court heard she was prescribed anti-depressants after talking to police, and had twice tried to take her own life in December 2012 and January 2013.

Her husband, Levine Andrade, 59, found his wife, known as Fran, dead at 8am on January 24 last year.

He said: 'She fell into incredible despair, the truth hit home. It was not something she wanted to report to the police.

'It brought back horrible memories from her past.

'Life took a real downturn after the court proceedings - that was when she was at her complete lowest.

'Apart from the trial bringing it all back up, she felt the defence barrister seemed to be attacking her personally.

'It got her completely down and she felt completely defenceless. I think she felt she was not prepared enough for the trial. She was not expecting to be attacked personally and have to answer so many direct questions in public.

'The words she used were: she felt as if she were the one on trial.'

Brewer and his ex-wife, Hilary Kay Brewer, known as Kay, were jailed after being convicted of sexual abuse

The court also heard Mrs Andrade had met Brewer on two occasions since the abuse, and even asked him to hand himself in.

Mr Andrade said his wife's mood changed after being asked to give a video interview for Surrey Police about the abuse she suffered, saying: 'She had very, very low mood swings and stayed in bed for days on end. She did not want to see anyone or speak to anyone.'

He said she would come downstairs to make herself food, go back to bed, while he took on caring for the children and teaching as well.

'It was very out of character, she loved the children, absolutely adored them,' he said.

'It got harder and harder towards the last few months. She did not want to speak to anybody.'

 

'She had very, very low mood swings and stayed in bed for days on end.  She did not want to see anyone or speak to anyone.'

 Levine Andrade on his wife, Frances

On the morning of her death, Mr Andrade, himself a musician and teacher, went to offer his wife a cup of tea and noticed she was cold.

After phoning for an ambulance, one of the couple's sons attempted CPR but when paramedics arrived they pronounced her dead.

Mr Andrade was also asked if there were any other issues that could have caused his wife's anxiety but said while family finances were a 'problem', it was only because they had used their savings to pay the children's school fees.

Mrs Andrade, who was adopted, had also traced her birth mother to Canada but found out she had two forms of cancer.

Mr Andrade said: 'She felt helpless that she was far away and could not do anything.'

In April this year, a serious case review by Surrey Safeguarding Adults Board said Mrs Andrade's death 'could and should' have been prevented, and mental health services failed to recognise she was vulnerable as she made repeated suicide bids.

Her death led to calls for the court system to improve how sexual abuse victims are treated.

The inquest continues and is scheduled to run into next week.
