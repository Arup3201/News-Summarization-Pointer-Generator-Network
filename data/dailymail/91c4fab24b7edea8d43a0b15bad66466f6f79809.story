Police revealed today that suspected cop killer Eric Frein may have been planning the attack on state troopers for 'at least a couple of years.'

Lt. Col George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State police said investigators have examined a computer Frein used and found he had extensively researched items such as how to avoid police manhunts and other survivalist techniques.

Bivens said the computer was not Frein's but one he used. Cops believe the fugitive deliberately destroyed the hard drive on his own computer before going on the run.

Hideout? Police combed the 400-room resort on 134 acres in Buck Hill Falls, Pennsylvania, which closed in 1991 after 90 years in business. It is now known as a spot where bored teens gather to party and set fires

Rambo: Roman Kamensky took this picture of Eric Frein in April 2009 in Canadensis, Pennsylvania. Frein was looking out of his back window, wearing a Serbian uniform from the 1990s at the time of the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. 'It was what is referred to as an "impression" picture,' said Kamensky. 'We take them to create a historical image'

In a briefing held Friday afternoon, police revealed that they believe Frein has a radio and could be monitoring news coverage of the massive search. They also say he may have set booby traps for the officers.

The hunt for Eric Frein moved to a huge abandoned Poconos resort today. Hundreds of heavily armed cops, many in camouflage, descended on the creepy Inn at Buck Hill Falls in Pennsylvania — once the backdrop for the MTV show Fear. But there were no signs of Frein at the sprawling property despite the search that lasted about 12 hours.

The 400-room resort on 134 acres in Buck Hill Falls, Pennsylvania closed in 1991 after 90 years in business and is now known as a spot where bored teens gather to party and set fires.

Bivens refused to comment on reports that Frein was initially located after he attempted to make a phone call home. He also would not comment directly on the report that bomb-making equipment was found at his parents' home but said there is a possibility that he has booby trapped areas in the woods where he is hiding.

Bivens called Frein 'an assassin' and addressed Frein directly.

'Eric, as I told you last week, you are a coward,' Bivens said. 'Your actions have caused tremendous disruption to an innocent community.

'We will not be intimidated,' Bivens continued. 'We will not leave. We will protect the community, we will find you and we will bring you to justice.'

'We are prepared to stay as long as necessary,' Bivens added. 'We are not going anywhere.' 

Manhunt: Bivens said Friday's intensive search of the Inn at Buck Hill Falls took between 10 and 12 hours as they searched every inch of the 400-room abandoned hotel and its 4,600 acres, including several caves

 

Message to Frein: 'Eric, as I told you last week, you are a coward,' Bivens said. 'Your actions have caused tremendous disruption to an innocent community.'

Frein was known to visit the Inn at Buck Hill Falls when it was operational, said Pennsylvania State trooper Tom Kelly.

Police Special Emergency Response Teams cordoned off the huge property as they went in to make a meticulous search of the massive building and its grounds.

Frein, 31, has now been on the run for two weeks after allegedly shooting Pennsylvania state trooper Bryon Dickson to death and critically injuring another trooper, Alex Douglass.

As MailOnline exclusively reported on Thursday, Frein may have believed Douglass, 31, was having an affair with the fugitive's sister-in-law Melissa Frein.

Melissa Frein lives less than half a mile away from Douglass in Olyphant, Pennsylvania and police admit the two knew each other. They say they aggressively interviewed Melissa about rumors of an affair but say they now do not believe the two were involved.

Melissa Frein, who recently left her job at the vaccine company Sanofi Pasteur in Swiftwater, Pennsylvania, did not return calls. A neighbor at the Olyphant address said he hadn't seen the mother-of-two for more than a week although he usually saw her every day.

Melissa is the wife of the alleged gunman's older brother, Michael. Eric Frein was best man at their 2007 wedding at St. Joseph Melkite Greek Catholic Church in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

Bivens said injured Trooper Douglass remains critical in hospital in a 'serious but stable condition.' He said Douglass had been 'troubled' by reports linking him with Frein's married sister-in-law.

Posh: The Buck Hill Falls resort was once a getaway for the rich and famous from New York and Philadelphia, but like many grand resorts in the Poconos it fell into disrepair

Police say the massive search of the hotel was precautionary. Spokesman, Trooper Tom Kelly said there had been no sightings there. 'It's just an area he was familiar with and it needed to be checked and cleared'

Where's Frein? Cops searched the resort but with no results. The owners say the inn  would make an ideal boutique hotel with condominiums and other single-family homes

Creepy: The interior of the abandoned hotel is like something out of the film The Shining

The Buck Hill Falls resort was once a getaway for the rich and famous from New York and Philadelphia, but like many grand resorts in the Poconos it fell into disrepair as faraway destinations became more accessible.

It is now up for sale with the owners touting 'a 27-hole Donald Ross designed golf course, 10 Har-Tru tennis courts, an expansive stone swimming pool, lawn bowling, blue-ribbon trout streams with waterfalls and hiking trails over approximately 4,500 acres of land,' among its selling points.

The owners say it would make an ideal boutique hotel with condominiums and other single-family homes

Police say the massive search of the hotel was precautionary. Spokesman, Trooper Tom Kelly said there had been no sightings there. 'It's just an area he was familiar with and it needed to be checked and cleared.'

He did not explain why it has taken two weeks for such a huge potential hiding place to be searched, or why there was such a massive movement of officers and equipment there.

The derelict hotel is a four-mile drive from the area south of Canadensis where police have said they were convinced that Frein, a survivalist who is said to harbor a deep resentment of law enforcement officers, had been surrounded.

Bivens said that police dogs had flushed Frein out of hiding in the woods on one occasion, but he was so far away from officers that he managed to flee and hide.

He said cops have not had a sighting of the fugitive since Tuesday afternoon

They revealed on Wednesday that they had found soiled diapers and a rare brand of Serbian cigarettes in that area bounded by Snow Hill Road and Bear Town Road. They say books taken from Frein's home advised survivalists to wear diapers so they could stay in one place for extended periods.

 Frein has been known to visit the hotel when it was operational, said Pennsylvaia State trooper Tom Kelly.

Motive? The story that state trooper Alex Douglass (right), who survived the shooting, and Melissa Frein,  the wife of Eric Frein's brother Michael (left) were having an affair has spread like wildfire through the towns surrounding Canadensis

Since the September 12 shootings, hundreds of police from all over Pennsylvania have been joined by officers from neighboring New York and New Jersey as well as members of the FBI, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and federal marshals as they search for Frein in woods south of the picturesque town of Canadensis.

Local residents have been turned out of their houses, searched and in some cases had to spend nights in their cars as police carry out their search.

The change in the focus of the search came amid new reports that Frein may have laid pipe bombs in the woods to prevent cops reaching him.

The Philadelphia Inquirer quoted sources as saying bomb-making equipment was found in his parents' home which is in the center of the search area.

'When investigators searched his parents' home this month, they found bomb-making materials but no finished explosives,' the Inquirer reported.

The paper also said Frein had tried to call his parents on September 18, the sixth day of the search and that the 'ping' from the call was traced, allowing police to close on him.

'Why Frein turned on his phone was unclear,' the Inquirer reported. 'And despite spotting him more than once since then, police and agents are proceeding with extreme caution because they believe Frein may have stashed pipe bombs in the terrain where he now is hiding.'

Bivens refused to comment on reports that Frein was initially located after he attempted to make a phone call home. He also would not comment directly on the report that bomb-making equipment was found at his parents' home but said there is a possibility that he has booby trapped areas in the woods where he is hiding.

Bivens appeared more downbeat than he had at previous press briefings. When questioned on his demeanor, he said: 'I dn't want anyone to thin I am not very confident that we are going to capture him. I am absolutely certain that we are going to capture him.'

Bivens said Frein bought several items before the shootings that would enable him to build a bunker-style hide-out in the woods. However he said police have not found that bunker though they have found many caves and outcrops that would give shelter.

Bivens said the soiled diapers and Serbian cigarettes that police had earlier found are still at the lab and positive DNA results should come within a matter of days. 

The search area expanded on Thursday to include much of the village of Canadensis and the surrounding communities of Cresco and Mountainhome. Police say they have been constantly changing the perimeter of their search area as possible new sightings are made.

Police say they do not believe Frein will target members of the public but they think he plans to kill more officers.
