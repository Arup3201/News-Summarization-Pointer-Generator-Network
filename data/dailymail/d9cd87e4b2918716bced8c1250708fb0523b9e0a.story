A new mother thought she was doing a good deed when she filmed an instructional breastfeeding video, but all she got was humiliation when the footage became a porn video.

MaryAnn Sahoury, of Fair Lawn, New Jersey, had reservations about breastfeeding after the birth of her daughter three years ago, and worked with a lactation consultant to help.

The consultant later informed her that she was going to be in an instructional video on Parents.com, and invited Ms Sahoury to appear with her.

A criminal complaint filed earlier this month said that Ms Sahoury participated 'because she felt her own personal experience would be insightful and helpful to other first-time mothers who are considering breastfeeding.'

Months went by after the video was filmed - and Ms Sahoury heard nothing about when it would appear on the Parents.com site.

But one day, during a Google search of her name, she was terrified to find that dozens of links to pornographic websites.

When she clicked on the links, she found that footage of the breastfeeding video had been re-edited with footage of a woman who looked similar to her.

She told CBS New York: 'It went from me talking, to a woman who looked like me having sex. It was just a full porn video, maybe six or seven minutes long.'

Ms Sahoury also found that the video used both her name and her daughter’s name, despite a promise by the video producer that no names would be used.

She is now filing a lawsuit against Parents TV and its parent company, the Meredith corporation, citing 'humiliation, severe stress, anxiety, panic attacks, crying and shaking spells, vomiting, depression, sleeplessness, anger, sadness, and an unhealthy obsession with trying to clear her and her daughter's name.'

In a statement to CBS New York, Meredith said: Meredith was appalled to learn someone misused a video meant to help new mothers.

'We took immediate action…Hiring specialists to file take-down demands [and] clear online caches.'

Ms Sahoury said that those efforts were not good enough, and she fears what will happen if classmates of her daughter find out about the ordeal.

She told the network:  'She’s almost 3 now and I think about what she'll be in middle school if one of her friends types her name and says, "Oh look at you, you’re on a porn site. How’d you get there?"'

She added: 'It's never going to be gone, because there is no delete button on the internet.'
