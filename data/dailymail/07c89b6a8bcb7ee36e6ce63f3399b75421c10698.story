The first clue to understanding Philippe Coutinho is that his hero is Ronaldinho, the Brazilian maestro who probably produced more tricks and flicks than any World Cup winner in history.

'He is my idol, the player I have watched the most and tried to copy the most,' says Liverpool's new samba star unashamedly. Ronaldinho is the reason he wears the No 10 shirt in the first place.

The downside of looking up to such a flamboyant character is that Ronaldinho, for all his fantastic ability, didn't really enjoy the 'other' side of the game – working, tackling, teamwork – and shied away from playing in the physical Premier League, even turning down Manchester United a year after his 2002 World Cup triumph and instead signing for Barcelona, even though the Catalans were not the world superpower they are today.

Marrying the two parts of football, individual creativity and team responsibility, has been the biggest problem for Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers getting the best out of 22-year-old Coutinho but after his spectacular FA Cup winner against Bolton on Wednesday night, significantly right at the end of the game in injury-time, it seems the penny has finally dropped with the player.

After an impressive start to his Liverpool career following his move from Inter Milan in 2013, it appeared twinkle-toed Coutinho was going backwards at the beginning of this season.

A home tie against Real Madrid in the Champions League should have been his stage but he was ignominiously substituted after 67 minutes as Liverpool were beaten 3-0. For the win-or-bust home game against Basle, Rodgers only trusted Coutinho as a sub. He was given just 15 minutes at the end and Liverpool crashed out.

Five days after that came his lowest point when Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher slated Coutinho for failing to follow Wayne Rooney in the build-up to Manchester United's opening goal in a 2-0 defeat at Old Trafford. 'It was unforgivable, lazy and weak,' raged Carragher.

Whether it was that stinging reminder about what was required as a Liverpool player or a talking-to from Rodgers, something has clicked for Coutinho.

Coutinho recently put pen to paper to sign new long-term contract at the club

Jason Cundy believes Coutinho is now better than fellow playmakers David Silva and Santi Cazorla

Coutinho - 2 goals in 20 Premier League appearances

Silva - 7 goals in 17 PL appearances

Cazorla - 6 goals in 19 PL appearances

Oscar - 6 goals in 19 PL appearances

In 2015, he has only been substituted once, Rodgers has trusted him to play the full 90 minutes and beyond, and the reward came at Bolton with his fantastic, curling right-foot strike that clipped the underside of the crossbar and into the net to book Liverpool a fifth-round tie at Crystal Palace.

A new long-term contract was signed earlier in the week and Rodgers has been gushing in his praise, hailing Coutinho's world-class potential and saying he's a player he would pay to watch.

On a late night radio discussion on talkSPORT after the win at Bolton, former Chelsea defender Jason Cundy said Coutinho was now the best No 10 in the Premier League, better than David Silva, Santi Carzola and Oscar, even though Oscar plays for Cundy's club Chelsea and was selected ahead of Coutinho for Brazil's World Cup squad.

What will please Coutinho, his manager and Ronaldinho is that the new, harder-working and more tactically-astute performances have not come at the expense of a drop in skill levels.

Coutinho is still fantastic on the ball, he set up the goals for Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge in Liverpool's last Premier League game, a 2-0 win against West Ham on Saturday, and is second in this season's Premier League stats for accurate through balls, with only Silva ahead of him. It's just he is also more disciplined with it.

It's a sobering thought that Coutinho had just celebrated his 10th birthday when he watched Ronaldinho score his wonder-goal against England's David Seaman  at the 2002 World Cup. From that moment, there was only one number and position the youngster wanted.

From the moment he walked into Liverpool's training ground, Rodgers spoke about his 'arrogance on the ball'. It was meant to be a compliment, and Coutinho took it as such.

'I know what he meant and I was very proud to hear it. It's very good support for me,' says the Brazilian.

Carragher of course demands the 'other' side of the game too, the side Ronaldinho never quite got and hence didn't come to England.

Coutinho is here, the contract he's just signed says he'll be here for another six years. Long before then, everyone might agree with Cundy that he really is the best No 10 in the country.
