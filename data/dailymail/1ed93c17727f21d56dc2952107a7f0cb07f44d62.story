Some of the earliest photographs taken of the Wimbledon tennis championships have emerged after 104 years.

The black and white snaps were taken by a spectator at the 1910 tournament and many show the prolific champion of the day, Tony Wilding.

The images include shots of a primitive-looking Centre Court as well as some of the outside courts that are separated by waist-high netting.

Wimbledon is renowned for its tradition and formality but the conservative outfits worn by male and female players and fans are in stark contrast to today's fashion.

Despite being at a different location, the main tennis arena was still called Centre Court. The championships moved to its present site at Southfields in 1922.

Stiff upper lip: Almost everyone in the crowd is dressed in suits and formal dresses, despite the June heat

Sadly, Wilding was killed fighting in the Battle of Aubers Ridge at Neuve-Chapelle, France, in 1915

The pictures have never been published before and are thought to be some of the earliest photos of the Wimbledon chamipionships

Men's doubles: The stylish yet restrictive attire sported by the players would be unthinkable in the modern game

The photos are now being sold at auction by a relative of the man who took them in June 1910. The tournament was the first of four Wimbledon single titles won by New Zealand player Wilding.

Wilding was the son of English immigrants to New Zealand and started playing ON the tennis courts at the family home.

He won numerous titles all over the world, including four at wimbledon in 1907, 1908, 1910 and 1914.

On May 9, 1915 Captain Wilding was killed when a shell exploded on the roof of a dug-out he was sheltering in during the Battle of Aubers Ridge at Neuve-Chapelle, France.

He also won his third of four doubles titles in the same year.

Sadly, the 1914 tournament, which he also won, was to be his last as the outbreak of war later that summer saw him join the Royal Marines. He died fighting in France a year later.

The snaps are being auctioned by Henry
 Aldridge and Son of Devizes, Wiltshire.

Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge 
said: 'Wimbledon is well known for being formal but today's 
championships are nothing compared to the Victorian and Georgian period.

'The photo of the mixed doubles match is quite interesting in that the attire worn by the woman is almost like an evening dress.

'When
 you compare it to the short tennis skirts and lycra worn by the likes 
of Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, it is really night and day.

'The
 spectators were just as smart with most of the men in smart suits and 
even top hat and tails, despite it being the middle of summer.

There are
 over 20 photographs that were taken by one spectator and have been in 
their family ever since.

'They
 have never been published before and must be some of the earliest 
photos of the Wimbledon championships, given that they are 104 years 
old.'

The photos are expecting to sell for up to £1,000 on Saturday.

Some things do stay the same: Wimbledon is the only Major still played on grass

The Wimbledon Championships were founded in 1877 - and were held at the All England Club Croquet Club in south west London.

It is one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments  - the others being the French Open, The US open and the Australian Open. It is the only major still played on grass court after the Australian open moved to hard court in 1988.

The All England Club was originally founded in 1868 in the grounds off Worple Road, Wimbledon.

Lawn tennis - a game created by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield - was added to the list of activities at the club in 1876. The venue was subsequently renamed 'The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club' - a change celebrated by the first Lawn Tennis Championship.

A year later in 1877, the first Wimbledon Championships opened on 9 July. The lawns for play were arranged so that the principle court was in the middle and the others around the edges - hence why the main lawn has the title 'centre court'.

Men's singles, the only event, was won by Spencer Gore from a field of 22. It is thought that around 200 sepctators attended the first final - paying a shilling entrance fee. The first Ladies Championship was held in 1884 - with Maud Watson winning the title. She was awarded a silver flower-basket worth 20 guineas.

In 1882,  'croquet' was
 dropped from the title as the venue was almost exclusivly known for tennis. It was restored in 1899 for sentimental reasons, however.

In 1922, the venue moved to Church Road. In 1980, fourt new courts were commissioned - with court number open opening in 1997.
