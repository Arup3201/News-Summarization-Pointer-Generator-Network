Iconic: President Barack Obama has been named as Time Magazine's Person of the Year for 2012

President Barack Obama has been named TIME's Person of the Year for 2012, allowing him the honour for the second time in four years.

The magazine cited the president's historic re-election last month as symbolic of the nation's changing demographics amid the backdrop of high unemployment and other challenges.

'He's basically the beneficiary and the author of a kind of new America - a new demographic, a new cultural America that he is now the symbol of,' TIME editor Rick Stengel said as he announced the choice on the Today show on Wednesday.

'He won re-election despite a higher 
unemployment rate than anybody's had to face in basically 70 years. 
He's the first Democrat to actually win two consecutive terms with over 
50 per cent of the vote. That's something we haven't seen since Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt.'

The 'Person of the Year' accolade is given to the 
person or thing that has most influenced the culture and news throughout the year for good or for ill.

Obama
was named as Person of the Year in 2008, with Federal Reserve Chairman 
Ben Bernanke, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and 'The 
Protester' filling the years in between.

This
year, Obama edged out Malala Yousufzai, a Pakistani girl shot in the 
head by the Taliban for advocating girls' education, for the honour. She
was named as runner up.

Shortlist: Obama also edged out Malala Yousufzai (pictured with her father and brothers), a 15-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot in the head by the Taliban for advocating girls' education

'Since October her message has been 
heard around the world, from cramped classrooms where girls scratch out 
lessons in the dirt to the halls of the U.N. and national governments 
and NGOs, where legions of activists argue ever more vehemently that the
key to raising living standards throughout the developing world is the 
empowerment of women and girls,' TIME wrote in a profile.

Other finalists included Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi and Higgs boson physicist Fabiola Gianotti.

In its latest edition and cover story, TIME explained its decision to name Obama as the winner.

'We are in the midst of historic cultural and demographic changes, and Barack Obama is both the symbol and in some ways the architect of this new America,' the editors wrote.

'In 2012, he found and forged a new majority, turned weakness into opportunity and sought, amid great adversity, to create a more perfect union.'

In a cover story, TIME's White House correspondent  Michael Scherer explained the 'Obama effect'.

Popular: TIME added that Obama, pictured at a campaign stop in November, could not even get Republicans to find negative things about him 'because they liked him personally'

'It could be measured - in wars stopped 
and started; industries saved, restructured or reregulated; tax cuts 
extended; debt levels inflated; terrorists killed; the health-insurance 
system reimagined; and gay service members who could walk in uniform 
with their partners,' he wrote.

Scherer added that after this year's election, Obama started working on a '40,000-foot' list of issues to tackle in his second term in the White House.

The list included climate change, the soaring cost of college, electoral reform and prison reform.  

Scherer also spoke about his personal attributes - and how Republicans struggled to be negative against him.

'There was almost nothing that would stick to this guy, because they just liked him personally,' Romney deputy campaign manager Katie Packer Gage told the magazine.
