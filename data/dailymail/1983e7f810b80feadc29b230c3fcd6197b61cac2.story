President John F. Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally weren't the only ones in the line of fire on that fateful day in 1963 - a 27-year-old car salesman standing 531 feet away was also wounded.

James Tague, known as 'the accidental victim,' has recounted the moment he felt something 'sting me in the face' after he heard what he first thought was a firecracker explode at Dealy Plaza.

The now-77-year-old was barely aware the president was in town until traffic stopped in front of him near the Plaza's triple underpass. Already late for a lunch date, he stepped out of his car to see what was going on.

Victim: James Tague, known as 'the accidental victim,' has recounted the moment he felt something 'sting me in the face' after he heard what he first thought was a firecracker explode at Dealy Plaza

'I'm standing there maybe four or five seconds, and somebody throws a firecracker,' Tague told MyFoxDFW.com this week. 'And I'm thinking, "What kind of idiot would be throwing a firecracker with the president going by?" Course, that was the first shot. Then the crack, crack, quick shots in a row, and something stings me in the face.' 

Tague said he was hit with pieces of concrete when a bullet intended for Kennedy missed the president's limousine and struck the curbside a few feet away from him.

The wound was so superficial that he didn't even know he'd been hit.

He said he and a deputy sheriff were trying to work out what had happened.

'We walked across the street just in time to hear this man sobbing, "His head exploded. His head exploded,"' Tague told the station. 'And the policeman said, 'Who's head?' And he said, 'The president's.'"

The deputy then pointed out the blood on his face.

'And that's when I remembered something had stung me in the face. And I reached up, and there was three or four drops of blood on my hand,' he said.

Tague was eventually taken to police headquarters to provide a statement and told MyFoxDFW.com that while he was waiting, Lee Harvey Oswald was brought in for questioning.

Tague's wounds did not require medical care and were only touched on in the initial media reports. However, six months later his story was picked up by The Associated Press and investigators examined the ricocheting bullet.

Until that point, authorities believed all three shots had struck the president and Governor Connally.

'They had to go back and rewrite the Warren Commission,' he said. 'That's where the magic bullet came from. That's the only thing they could come up with. That one bullet went through two people.'

Curbside: The piece of curbstone that was hit by the bullet that then struck Tague was removed, pictured, and taken to the National Archives in Washington

At that point, Tague started doing his own research on the assassination.

But he found that the piece of curbstone that was hit by the bullet that then struck him had been removed and taken to the National Archives in Washington.

Tague has spent more than three decades researching the shooting and believes Kennedy was killed by a team of hit men hired by then-Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. 

'Finding this was no big deal, it's like a crossword puzzle — you just got to start putting the pieces together,' Tague told TimesDispatch.com. 'Kennedy's assassination was not a conspiracy, it was a coup.'

But despite this firm belief, Tague still finds it hard to discuss what he observed that day.

'I have never found the right words to describe it. It's like it happened in a movie or something,' Tague told TimesDispatch.com. 'Fifty years later, I still haven't fully accepted that he was killed right in front of me.'

He was struck by concrete from a first bullet that ricocheted off a curbside, before a second bullet hit JFK and Connally and a third struck the president in the head
