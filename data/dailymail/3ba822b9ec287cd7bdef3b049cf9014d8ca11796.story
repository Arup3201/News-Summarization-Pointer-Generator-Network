The girl was lucky to escape with minor injuries when she was flung into the air after being hit by the before slowly driving off.

A 12-year-old girl was hit by a car while crossing the road in Blenheim, New Zealand on Wednesday

The girl, identified by  Stuff.co.nz as Deisha Graham, was struck as she crossed the rain-swept road  in Blenheim, in New Zealand's South Island.

After she was clipped, she slid a few metres along the pavement and landed in a crumpled heap by the side of the road.

As the two people with her, believed to be her half-brother and sister, ran to help the car came to a halt - before driving off.

Flying a few metres from the hood of the car, the girl luckily escaped without any serious injuries

It was also confirmed on the page by police that 'the girl required hospital treatment but her injuries weren't serious.'

Tasman District Communications Manager Barbara Dunn told the MailOnline the girl is now doing fine.

The schoogirl's mum, Leana Hoeta said she was upset that the driver did not stop to see if her daughter was OK.

'I think they might have been a bit shocked and they didn't react as quick as other people would have,' she said.

The Marlborough region has been experiencing heavy downpours, and Ms Dunn said 'there had been a lot of issues with rain' in the area.

On Tuesday Marlborough Police issued a warning via social media for motorists in the area to take care in the wet weather conditions.

'Marlborough Police are asking motorists travelling between Blenheim and Kaikoura to take care and drive to the conditions as heavy rain has caused some surface flooding.

'If rain continues its likely that cars and motor cycles will not be able to get through between these towns soon.'
