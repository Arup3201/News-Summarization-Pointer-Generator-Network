It sounds like something between celery and cheerio. The Suzuki Celerio — its new global city car — goes on sale in the UK from February, costing around £7,000.

Despite its compact size,the Japanese maker says it has plenty of cabin space for five occupants and provides' class leading luggage capacity' of 254 litres. It was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show earlier this year.

It will be available in six colours — five metallic finishes and one with a solid colour.

Standard specification includes six airbags, ESP stability control, air conditioning, alloy wheels, DAB Radio, CD Tuner,USB and Bluetooth connectivity.

The Celerio offers very low CO2 emissions of 99g/km and frugal fuel consumption of 65.7mpg

Next summer Suzuki promises even more,with a new Dual jet engine offering even greater economy and CO2 emissions that fall to just 84g/km.

This will be linked to Suzuki's newly developed Auto Gear Shift (AGS) which allows the gearshift and clutch to operate automatically.

A spokesman said: 'The driver can enjoy the effortless driving of an automatic, but without any loss in fuel efficiency or increase in CO2 emissions.' 

The AGS system also allows a low-speed 'creep' facility which lets the car move in gear without the accelerator being applied, ideal in slow traffic and when parking.

Order books have opened in the UK for the Mercedes-AMG GT super-coupe, with prices from £97,195, then accelerating almost as fast as the car.

The first ones to arrive in April will be the GT S (£110,495) and GT S Edition 1 (£122,745) variants — powered by an all-new four-litre bi-turbo V8 engine. This develops a mighty 510bhp (equivalent to five Ford Fiestas), allowing it to accelerate from rest to 62mph in just 3.8 seconds. Top speed is a modest 193 mph.

The 'entry level' £97,195 GT version planned to be on sale late next year will be powered by a 462 bhp V8 engine, with acceleration from rest to 62mph in four seconds and a top speed of 189mph.

The cars feature 19in wheels front and rear, a switchable AMG performance exhaust, AMG sports suspension and an adjustable electronic rear wing.

The GTS adds 20in rear wheels, red brake callipers clamping enlarged discs, an electronicallycontrolled rear differential, AMG ride control sports suspension with three selectable modes and an increase in power to 510 bhp.

The GTS Edition 1 brings a fixed rear wing and accompanying deep front splitter, a carbon roof, black mirror surrounds with matching window surrounds and rear diffuser, black exhaust tips, red interior contrast stitching, leather and suede finish for the special AMG performance seats and the steering wheel, and a centre console in 'Black Diamond' textured finish.

Jaguar took the wraps off its firstfour-wheel-driveF-Type this week. The sure-footed AWD F-Type R Coupe will accelerate fromrestto60mphin3.9seconds with top speed limited to 186mph.

It has been on test in South Africa, where the Bloodhound SSC world land speed record programme — which Jaguar is supporting—isalsounderwa

This limited-edition £180,000 Range Rover comes complete with its own gun cabinet

Land Rover has unveiled its most expensive car — a limited-edition £180,000 Range Rover, complete with its own gun cabinet.

The top-of-the-range 4x4 was designed and built by Land Rover's Special Vehicle Operations arm in collaboration with British gun-maker Holland & Holland.

In the boot is a leather-trimmed aluminium cabinet designed to carry a pair of Holland & Holland shotguns.

Craftsmen have upholstered the interior with the softest tan and espresso leather hides and sustainable French walnut, while the rear looks more like a private jet than a farm vehicle and features super-suave seats which recline 17 degrees, plus walnut tables, bespoke lighting, plenty of legroom and an entertainment system.

The boot floor can slide out to make the gun cabinet easily accessible and also doubles as a picnic table.

At £110,000 more than a standard Range Rover, is costs the same as a Ferrari 458.

Forty a year will be built, with either a 4.4 diesel or 5.0 supercharged petrol engine.
