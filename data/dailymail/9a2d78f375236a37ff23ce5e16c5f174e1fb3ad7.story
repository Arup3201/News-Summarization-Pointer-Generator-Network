Northumbria Police have carried out raids at 13 properties and 12 men and two women have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to rape

Police have arrested 12 men and two women as part of an investigation into allegations of sexual abuse of teenage girls and young adults in north-east England.

Officers carried out raids in Newcastle as Northumbria Police reacted to information they had received about a series of sexual assaults against a number of victims.

As part of Operation Sanctuary, 13 properties were searched this morning and 12 men and two women were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to rape.

The police said some of the victims were in care when the alleged offending took place and that their priority now was to protect them while forensic teams secure important evidence.

The alleged offenders are said to be from 'a range of communities' and police have urged against speculating about their background.

Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Gary Calvert said: 'This is a sensitive investigation which is at a very early stage and moving rapidly.

'I understand that these types of allegations can cause the public concern and I want to reassure the community that police take crimes of this nature extremely seriously and will thoroughly investigate them.

'Our overarching priority is to protect any victims or potential victims and to bring any offenders to justice.

'I must emphasise that the suspects do not come from one community, but a range of communities, and it would be very wrong to speculate until we have the full facts which may take some time.

'The victims include teenage girls as well as young adults.

'We are working closely with our partners, in particular the local authorities, and are grateful for their co-operation.

'I would stress there is nothing to suggest there is any risk to the general public as we believe the victims and suspects were known to each other.'

He said officers known to their communities would be on patrol and asked anyone with information to come forward.

The police said the investigation, which was launched a few weeks ago, was sparked after they received information from an alleged victim.

But they indicated that they did not yet know the full scale of the offending and how wide it might reach.

Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes said he was shocked and appalled at the nature of the allegations and urged people not to panic.

He said as soon as they became aware that some of the alleged victims were in the care system, they acted to ensure their safety.

He said: 'I'm sure I speak on behalf of the entire city when I say how shocked and appalled I am by the alleged nature of these offences.

'It's vital that communities pull together through this difficult time and co-operate with the police in what I know is going to be a very extensive investigation over the next few weeks.

'As soon as we were aware that some of the victims had been in the care system, we acted to ensure they were safe.

'It's absolutely essential that, once the full investigation has been conducted, we look at all the safeguarding procedures and whether anything could be reviewed or improved for the future.

'It's important not to panic, it's important to remember that the victims and the alleged offenders knew each other, so there are not any teenage girls or women who are at risk as a result.'
