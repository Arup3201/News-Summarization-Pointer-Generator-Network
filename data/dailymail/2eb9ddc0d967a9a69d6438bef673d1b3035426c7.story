Morgan Schneiderlin could not muster the mental strength to play for Southampton a few weeks ago, such was his desire to leave the club. But he committed himself to the task at hand, scoring twice to secure victory for his team.

The Frenchman is now ‘99 per cent certain’ still to be at the club after the transfer window closes, according to boss Ronald Koeman. If Southampton are to repeat the success of last season, when they finished eighth, they need him to stay.

Koeman said he is confident the group of players he has can dispel the gloom and doom that descended since the departure of Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert, among others. The manner in which they came from behind to beat West Ham at home did nothing to contradict that belief.

‘We were a much better team than West Ham,’ said Koeman. ‘It was a deserved win. I told them at half- time to play as winners and they kept that spirit.’

The afternoon began with an almost full Upton Park brimming with optimism to greet the unveiling of former Arsenal star Alex Song, brought in on loan from Barcelona. The new recruit watched from the stands but may have been longing for Catalonia after his team-mates let their lead slip in dire fashion.

Boos rang out from the hardy souls who remained until the final whistle. The players trudged off the pitch looking downtrodden and Sam Allardyce did little to improve their mood in the changing room.

‘There was nothing to be pleased about,’ he said. ‘It was an under-par performance across the board and perhaps some of the players need a reality check.’

West Ham claimed they had ‘fought off interest’ from Europe’s biggest clubs to seal the Song deal. Allardyce laid a big task at his feet.

‘I hope as well as his quality he will bring experience and leadership,’ he said. ‘I hope he will kick a few backsides on the pitch. It doesn’t appear like anybody is taking responsibility.’

West Ham went ahead in the 26th minute. Upton Park new boy Mauro Zarate exploited a rare hiccup by Schneiderlin, catching him in possession and passing to Mark Noble, whose shot from outside the area deflected off Maya Yoshida and to the left of Fraser Forster.

Serbia midfielder Dusan Tadic was identified as a danger before the match by Allardyce and he lived up to his billing. Tadic’s free-kick just before half-time reached Schneiderlin, whose right-footed shot was blocked but he finished with his left foot into the top corner.

West Ham’s defence was exposed again after 68 minutes when Tadic played a short corner to Ward-Prowse, who crossed for Scheiderlin to volley in.

‘I was pleased with his attitude,’ said Koeman, ‘It’s been difficult for him. I understand his situation with offers from other clubs but he is happy now.’
