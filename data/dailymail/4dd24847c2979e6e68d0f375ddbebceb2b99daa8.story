Prosecutors have detained the head of the South Korean company that owns the ferry that sank killing 300 people last month over an allegation of cargo overloading.

Authorities believe improper stowage and overloading of cargo are one possible reason why the Sewol ferry sank on April 16.

Four employees at the ferry's owner Chonghaejin Marine Co who handled cargo on the vessel, have already been arrested.

Kim Han-sik, president of Chonghaejin, was detained ahead of his possible formal arrest on allegations that he was aware that the ferry exceeded its cargo limit but did not do anything before it started its trip, according to senior prosecutor Yang Jung-jin.

Mr Yang said prosecutors are investigating Kim's actions before deciding if they will request a court to issue a warrant to formally arrest him.

All 15 surviving crew members involved in the ferry's navigation have been arrested, accused of negligence and failing to protect passengers.

More than three weeks after the sinking, 269 bodies have been retrieved but 35 others are still listed as missing.

The news comes as the first picture has been released of a civilian diver, who died while trying to recover bodies trapped in the wreckage of the Sewol.

Lee Kwang-wook died in hospital on Tuesday after becoming unconscious following searches off the southern coast of South Korea, where the Sewol sank.

Some task force team officials say the 53-year-old diver was pulled to the surface by fellow divers after losing communication.

Searches for bodies have been hampered by strong currents and floating debris inside the ship.

Yesterday, the South Korean Prime Minister called for underwater searches to be completed by the weekend.

Chung Hong-won told a cabinet council meeting that workers must ‘resolve to finish searches’ by Saturday as tidal currents are forecast to be weak until then.

The lengthy, difficult underwater search for bodies off South Korea's southern coast has deepened the anguish of families of missing people, who have been camping out at a nearby port waiting for the news of their loved ones.

Many South Koreans have been highly critical of the government's handling of the rescue effort, and the regulatory failures that may have allowed the disaster to happen.

On Wednesday, the government announced it miscounted the number of survivors, the latest in a series of errors that have eroded the nation's confidence in its leaders.

Coastguard chief Kim Suk-kyoon said 172 people survived the sinking of the ferry Sewol - not 174, as the government had been saying since April 18.

Mr Kim said one of the survivors was accidentally listed twice, and he blamed the other mistake on an inaccurate report by a passenger.

He added there are two more missing passengers than authorities previously knew about. Both are Chinese nationals.

That change raises the number of people feared dead to 304. More than 80% of them are students from a single high school near Seoul who were on a trip to southern Jeju island.

There is evidence not only that the ship was overloaded with cargo, but that the agency responsible for ensuring passenger safety had incorrect information about how much the ship could safely carry.
