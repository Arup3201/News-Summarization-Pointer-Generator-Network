A New York father was charged with child endangerment after police say he left his toddler daughter alone in a hot car to go shopping.

The incident took place in the parking lot of a TJ Maxx store in Selden, Long Island, Wednesday afternoon.

Suffolk County police officers responded to the shopping center at Selden Plaza at around 2pm after getting a 911 call about a child locked inside a car.

Father doesn't know best: Juan Pablo Aguilar Varela, 32, has been charged with endangering the welfare of a child after police say he left his 4-year-old asleep in the backseat of a hot car to go shopping

The 4-year-old girl was discovered sleeping in the backseat of her father's Mercedes Benz, which was locked and had its windows lowered only about half an inch.

Temperatures in Selden were in the mid-80s at the time of the incident.

It is believed that the toddler was left alone in the car for about 15 minutes.

A Good Samaritan initially flagged down Dave Panebianco, with the Selden Fire Department, in the parking lot and informed him of the little girl in the backseat of a Mercedes.

‘I could see a little girl in the backseat, covered by what looked to be like a sun visor of some sort that you kind of put in the front window,’ Panebianco told CBS New York. ‘And I could see that she was breathing. And I could also see that she was kind of covered in sweat.’

First responders who were summoned to the scene were able to unlock the vehicle and remove the toddler from the backseat. 

Shopping trip gone awry: The little girl was spotted covered in sweat inside her father's Mercedes Benz parked outside this TJ Maxx store in Selden, NY, with its windows rolled down half an inch 

Panebianco carried the child into his air-conditioned car and administered first aid for a heat emergency. She was later taken to Stony Brook University Hospital for a check-up.

Police officers then entered the TJ Maxx and tracked down the child's father, identified as 32-year-old Juan Pablo Aguilar Varela.

The man was arrested on a charge of endangering the welfare of a child. He is expected to be arraigned Thursday.
