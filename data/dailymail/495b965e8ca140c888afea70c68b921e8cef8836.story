A massive public sector walkout expected to cause chaos on Thursday is ‘entirely legitimate’, a senior Labour figure said last night.

Shadow Welsh Secretary Owen Smith said that pay had been frozen for too long and he ‘completely’ understood why the hundreds of thousands of workers were planning to strike.

Mr Smith, who was drafted into the Shadow Cabinet by leader Ed Miliband two years ago, went further than any other Labour frontbencher in giving the strikes full-throated backing – and indicated he wanted more money spent on public sector wages.

The Tories said it showed that Labour was ‘still the party of strikes and uncontrolled  public sector pay’.

The main unions with workers in the state sector plan to mount a co-ordinated walkout on Thursday.

Thousands of schools are expected to close as a result of the strike by a single teaching union, the NUT – causing misery for parents.

Firefighters are also downing tools for nine hours – the 15th such strike by the Fire Brigades Union in recent years.

One union leader, Unison’s Dave Prentis, has predicted the planned action could  be bigger than the General Strike of 1926.

Senior Labour figures have tried to distance themselves from the walkout, with many saying they support only the general right of workers to go on strike. On Sunday, the party’s education spokesman, Tristram Hunt, refused three times to condemn the NUT strike, and also declined to support teachers crossing picket lines.

But yesterday, speaking on the BBC’s Daily Politics, Mr Smith made clear his backing for the unions’ action.

He said it was legitimate as public sector wages had been frozen for ‘far too long’ and staff were right to worry about pensions and pay.

‘Would I like to see the public sector given a pay increase?’ he said. ‘Absolutely. Have we seen pay being frozen for far too long from the perspective of those individuals? Yes we have.

‘Are they right to be worrying about pensions, pay and the way in which earnings are being outstripped by inflation? Of course they are. So I completely understand the decision they are taking to strike.’

Mr Smith was then asked by presenter Jo Coburn if he supported ‘the strike, not just the right to strike, on the basis it has been so tough on pay’.

He replied: ‘I do. I think it’s a very legitimate thing for them to voice their concern about the nature of their jobs and how long people will have to work and about how much they are earning.

‘They [the strikes] are entirely legitimate.’

Mr Smith is a former BBC journalist who worked as an adviser for Labour in Northern Ireland before he was elected MP for Pontypridd in 2010.

Tory MP Chris Skidmore said: ‘These comments make one thing abundantly clear – Labour are still the party of strikes and uncontrolled public sector pay.

‘Ed Miliband must get a grip and condemn these strikes from his union paymasters – strikes which will damage children’s education, hurt the economy and inconvenience millions of ordinary people.

‘If Miliband remains silent there can only be one conclusion: he’s a weak leader who just isn’t up to the job.’

The planned walkout has prompted calls for new laws to constrain strike action. Critics say it should not go ahead when the turnout in some ballots was as low as 25 per cent.  

Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude is drawing up plans for a minimum turnout of 50 per cent before a strike can proceed – but the Lib Dems are blocking any further union laws.
