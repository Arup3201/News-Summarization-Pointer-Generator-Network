Welcome back, Colombia. They may be in the shadow of more illustrious South American contenders but what an exhilarating performance they put on Saturday amid another intoxicating atmosphere at this goal spree of a World Cup.

Missing the mercurial talents of Radamel Falcao to a pre-tournament injury that robbed them of one of the world’s most potent strikers, they were nevertheless far too good for an ageing Greek team whose game plan went out of the window after five minutes.

Just like in Sao Paolo in the opening game, Belo Horizonte’s imposing stadium was turned into a sea of yellow, but yellow of a different patriotic fervour. More than 40,000 Colombians poured into Brazil’s third largest city hoping to carry on where they had left off in qualifying when they finished second behind Argentina.

Coach Jose Pekerman described the 
loss of Falcao, otherwise known as El Tigre, as his saddest day since 
taking charge of Los Cafeteros but it mattered little as his team 
cemented their status as dangerous floaters with a delicious exhibition 
of South American flair.

Colombia's
 first World Cup match in the finals since 1998 offered a distinct clash
 of styles. While the Greeks are known for their defensive nous and 
conceded only four goals in qualifying, Colombia, who scored 27 goals 
and had the most shots on target, only know how to play one way.

And
 so it proved in an intriguing lunchtime encounter, the first of Super 
Saturday’s foursome at the same venue where England will wrap up their 
group action against Costa Rica.

Even
 without Falcao – who nevertheless provided moral support by hugging 
each  and every one of his team-mates before kickoff -- Colombia were 
still brimming with talent and their deafening fans, bathed in sunshine,
 belted out the national anthem.

Greece,
 as we all know,  can be disciplined, organised opponents as Otto 
Rehhagel's side proved a decade ago when they shocked the world by 
becoming champions of Europe.

Yesterday,
 however, they never really looked the part and got off to the worst 
possible start when Pablo Armero -- on loan at West Ham from Napoli last
 season – struck low and hard and the ball deflected off Kostantinos 
Manolas, not the best 23rd birthday present for Olympiakos Piraus 
defender, sparking bedlam at the side of the pitch and in the stands.

Up for it: Vasilis Torosidis (left) came closest to scoring for Greece with his second-half header hitting the bar

With
 their plan to contain and counter shot to pieces, the Greeks found it 
hard to change tack. Yet as the first half drew to a close, they started
 to ask questions, Panagiotis Kone’s fierce drive being spectacularly 
punched away by David Ospina.

Before
 they could step it up , however, they faced an bigger mountain to 
climb.  Shortly after the break, Teofilo Gutierrez, who plays his club 
football in Argentina and led the attack in place of Falcao, latched on 
to a swirling corner and finished sweetly from close range.

What
 a chance Greece had of getting back in the game, only for Theofanis 
Gekas to miss from two yards as his header struck the underside of the 
bar before being cleared off the line. It was the sitter of the 
tournament to date and effectively Greece’s last throw of the dice. The 
“Oles” reverberated around the stadium and just to make their day,the 
hugely talented James Rodriguez steered home a third in stoppage time.

'This
 was the first match we’ve played in the finals for a long time and 
result will obviously help us stay in the tournament,' said the 
understated Pekerman. 

'It’s
 a dream to be here. Greece are an experienced team and the group is 
very evenly matched. My players did exactly what was asked of them. I’m 
deeply moved so many Colombians have come to Brazil.'

Greece’s
 Portuguese coach Fernando Santos was annoyed his team switched off late
 on and conceded a third goal that might prove pivotal.

'Some
 of the players thought it was over. It’s something I’ll have to talk to
 the about. Nothing Colombia did surprised us but they controlled the 
game. Now we have to think positive.'
