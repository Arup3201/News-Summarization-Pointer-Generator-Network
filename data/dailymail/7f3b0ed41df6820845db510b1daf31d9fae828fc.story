She is used to enjoying the luxury of multi-million-pound mansions set in vast grounds, with swimming pools, tennis courts and private driveways.

But Anthea Turner has moved a rung or two down the property ladder and is now living in a rented terrace house, it can be revealed.

The five-bedroom townhouse in South-West London is worth around £1.2million, and the 53-year-old former GMTV and Blue Peter presenter is paying around £6,000 month in rent.

Even so, it is a far cry from her most recent grand home, a £5million mansion in Esher, Surrey, which she shared with husband Grant Bovey. Standing in almost two acres of land, it had an indoor swimming pool and marble-floored hallway.

She moved out of the marital home in November and was pictured locking up for a final time in tears after the pair ended their 13-year marriage following his affair with a 25-year-old.

Miss Turner, once the highest paid woman on British TV, has to park on the street at her new home, which does not have its own parking or driveway.

She is also having to get used to having neighbours again, with properties on both side on the tree-lined street, which is close to council-run allotments.

She is thought to have chosen the smaller property to be close to her sister, Wendy, as she rebuilds her life.

At the end of last year, she said: ‘They say the top three slots on the stress league table are death, divorce and moving house. Well, I’m currently going through numbers two and three.’

She ended her marriage with Bovey after discovering her was cheating on her for a second time with socialite Zoe de Mallet Morgan.

Bovey, 52, who lost his fortune when his property empire collapsed, has also downsized to a rented property in Cobham, Surrey.

He became one of the most high-profile casualties of the recession when his business Imagine Homes, Britain’s biggest buy-to-let company at the time, filed for bankruptcy.

Miss Turner succeeded in ring-fencing her money because she was never a director of any of her husband’s firms.

She was last year reported to be in the early stages of a relationship with former Dragon’s Den star and Australian private investor Richard Farleigh, also 53.

Last week she returned to London from Austria after reaching the semi-final of celebrity winter sports programme The Jump on Channel 4.

After Anthea Turner married Radio 1 DJ Peter Powell in 1990 the couple built a £1.8million detached mock Georgian house in Twickenham, West London, but moved out when they split.

She and second husband Grant Bovey bought Barbins Grange, a farmhouse in 50 acres at Dunsfold near Godalming, Surrey, for £2.2million in 1999. It had a library, wine cellar, stables, cinema, helipad, pool and polo field. They sold it ten years later for £11.5million.

They downsized to Hascombe Court Farm, which they bought for £6million from DJ Chris Evans, but lived there for only a year. The four-bedroom house, also in Goldalming, had a separate three-bedroom cottage and two-bedroom barn. They sold it for £5million.

Their final home together was the six-bedroom property in Esher, Surrey, which was bought for £4.3million in April 2011.

The couple also had a £4million ski chalet with an outdoor whirlpool bath, massage room and sauna in the French Alps at Megève. She reportedly told friends last year that she was selling it.
