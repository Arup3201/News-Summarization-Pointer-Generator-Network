A CCTV operator did not spot a young woman being dragged through a city centre before being raped in a tent pitched next to a dual carriageway.

Their 19-year-old victim had been out celebrating her birthday in Hull with friends when she was targeted by Fabio Ferreira and Daniel Haldenby, then aged 17.

She had become separated from the group she went out with and the pair discovered her passed out on a bench outside a Kwik Save supermarket.

Fabio Ferreira and Daniel Haldenby were jailed for five years after dragging their victim to a tent and raping her

They dragged her back to a tent they had pitched off Freetown Way, in the city, where they attacked her.

They ordeal was captured on the city council’s CCTV system dragging her along Freetown Way. However, they were not spotted at the time by a CCTV operator.

A jury at Hull Crown Court took just an hour-and-a-half to find Ferreira and Haldenby, both now 18, unanimously guilty of rape. Judge James Sampson jailed them each for five years.

Because they were 17 at the time of the offence they were dealt with as juveniles by the court. Had they been older they would have received a longer sentence.

Judge Sampson told them: 'She was alone, vulnerable, drunk and incapable of coherent speech and you quickly realised that.

'She
couldn’t walk and needed help and assistance. Instead of helping her 
you carried her to your tent and you raped this young woman.

'By
the time the morning arrived she was abandoned, alone, confused and 
disorientated. The two of you had one thing in mind, the abuse of this 
young woman for your own short-term sexual gratification.

'This was a serious case of rape. You are both immature, uneducated, unemployed youths leading somewhat feral lives.'

Ferreira and Haldenby had pitched a tent off Freetown Way and gone on a night out in the city centre on May 7 last year.

As they returned at 2am they found the woman slumped on a bench outside the former Kwik Save supermarket in Prospect Street.

Haldenby stole her handbag and belongings, before he and Ferreira dragged her unconscious back to their tent.

She had ended up at the Rose Hotel in Beverley Road, watching a band, after getting separated from her friends.

A couple had walked her back into the 
city to get a taxi but she sat on the bench by Kwik Save. Despite the 
couple offering to stay with her, she refused to let them, insisting she
was fine.

Ferreira and Haldenby found her moments later.

The
victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, woke up alone to 
discover she was undressed and ran to a friend’s house for help.

When
she took the police back to the scene the tent was gone and just empty 
cider bottles remained. Her attackers were later arrested and claimed 
she had consented to sex.

The woman was tearful as she told the court: 'I cannot remember anything. It was not with consent. I don’t go out to do that, I go out to have fun and go home.

'I’m not like that, I wouldn’t let people carry me somewhere and do that. I wouldn’t go and have sex with a stranger.'

A council spokeswoman said: 'The city’s CCTV cameras are manned 24/7 by an average of four staff at any one time. With over 300 cameras to monitor, it is not possible to watch every camera at all times. However, all cameras are recorded.

'The CCTV system has contributed to over 2,000 arrests in the previous 12 months.'

Ferreira, of Kinthorpe, north Hull, has previous warnings and reprimands for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, possessing an imitation firearm and shoplifting.

Haldenby, of Kilburn Avenue, west Hull, has previous convictions for dishonesty.

Haldenby claimed he had been drinking heavily as he was struggling to cope with the murder of his uncle, Marc Irwin, 36, who was hacked to death with a meat cleaver in west Hull by a burglar in 2008.
