Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy added a touch of glamour to the annual L'Ormarins Queen's Plate in Cape Town over the weekend.

The South African-born beauty wore a cobalt dress, in accordance with the prestigious riding event's blue and white dress code, as she joined her brother Shaun and a few friends at a restaurant  for a quick drink before heading to the equestrian event.

Chelsy, 29, and her female friend complemented each other in similar short blue dresses worn with wedges on Saturday.

She might not mingle with the Royal Family anymore, but Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy still has a penchant for all things posh, such as the annual L'Ormarins Queen's Plate in Cape Town.

And there's no denying her dress sense is very Duchess-esque. Nude wedge heels and a classic cobalt dress by Stella McCartney? We could be describing the Duchess of Cambridge's wardrobe!

We love the flattering frill in front of Chelsy's dress, which features a belted waist and V-neck. It's perfect for styling up or down depending on the occasion, plus the bold cobalt hue is bang on trend this season, with labels like Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga and Victoria Beckham all showing the shade on the runway.

The group struggled to get a taxi to the races, as the area was congested with road closures while the country's leading political party, the ANC, celebrated their 103rd Birthday party at the nearby Cape Town stadium. 

Nearly 100,000 people were drawn to the area to join in the celebrations. Chelsy and her group eventually managed to arrange an UberBlack taxi to get them to the races in style. 

The event, now in its 154th year, is widely regarded as the first prestigious equestrian event of the year and attracts the glossiest locals. 

As well as 12 races, the illustrious races offer lavish entertainment and after-parties with a strict white and blue dress code.

Chelsea was last seen out and about in the UK in December where she reunited with Prince Harry at a charity carol concert in Chelsea.

Chelsy, who remains a close friend of Prince Harry, heard both Harry and William pay heartfelt tribute to their friend Henry van Straubenzee, who was killed in a car crash in 2002 aged just 18 years old. 

Since his death, the foundation set up in his memory has raised enough money to support the education of more than 26,000 children in 39 schools across Uganda.
