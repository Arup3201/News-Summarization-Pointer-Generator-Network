It is less than a year since doctors performed a miracle and revived former Bolton Wanderers footballer Fabrice Muamba after he 'died' for 78 minutes when his heart stopped on the pitch.

But the ex-midfielder is set to become a father for the second time - with the news announced just ten months after he collapsed during an FA Cup tie at White Hart Lane.

The 24-year-old is said to be 'elated' at the news that wife Shauna is expecting a child in June.

The pair are thought to have found out their good news shortly before Christmas.

A friend of the couple told The Sun: 'They would have been thrilled anyway but given what happened to Fabrice last year, they feel even more blessed and lucky.

'Both were looking forward to 2013 but this makes it more special.'

Muamba and Shauna tied the knot last October seven months on from his heart atack at a ceremony at the 19th century Peckforton Castle in Cheshire attended by several football stars past and present and some of the doctors who battled to save Fabrice.

He had proposed to Shauna just a month before his collapse.

The overjoyed couple already have a four-year-old son, Joshua, who is said to be excited that he will have a sibling to play with.

Millions of horrified football fans had watched as Muamba collapsed 41 minutes into the televised FA Cup Quarter Final clash at White Hart Lane on March 17 last year.

Medics battled to save the footballer for 78 minutes both on the pitch and in hospital before they managed to get his heart beating again.

He was shocked with a defibrilator 15 times.

In the days that followed, football fans and players from teams around the world united in support for Fabrice sending messages of support to the star.

But since then he has made an incredible recovery.

He was reportedly joking with doctors within a week of his cardiac arrest, asking medical staff if Bolton had won the tie as soon as he came around.

Muamba has had a pacemaker fitted to correct the irregular heartbeat that caused his collapse andÂ  he has been forced to retire from professional football.
