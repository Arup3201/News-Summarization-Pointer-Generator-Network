Many new parents would say the first year of a baby's life passes in a blur.

But this little boy's mother and father can revisit all 365 days-worth of precious moments - after compiling an incredible video montage of their son's journey from the delivery room to his first birthday party.

Sam and Beverley Cornwell, from Hayling Island in Hampshire, filmed baby Indigo on their smartphones each day for a year after he was born, and photographer Mr Cornwell has now edited the footage into a time-lapse video charting the first 12 months of their son's life.
