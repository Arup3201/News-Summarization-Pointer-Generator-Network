A High Court judge in London has removed a jail threat which had been hanging over former Rangers owner Craig Whyte following the launch of civil court proceedings.

An arrest warrant had been issued after he failed to attend a High Court hearing relating to a dispute with a ticketing firm.

But Mr Justice Newey on Friday discharged an order after Mr Whyte appeared in court.

Proceedings were adjourned. 

Mr Whyte, 43, failed to attend a hearing after being ordered to pay more than £17 million to Ticketus following a civil court dispute, Mr Justice Newey heard.

He was made the subject of a 'suspended committal order' - under which he could have been jailed if found to be in contempt of court.

A judge issued an arrest warrant.

But Mr Justice Newey discharged that order today - lifting the threat of jail - after Mr Whyte appeared before him.

Lawyers for Mr Whyte said he had been out of the country and he would co-operate with proceedings.

And Mr Justice Newey said complaints about Mr Whyte would be examined at a later date.

Ticketus claimed that Mr Whyte fraudulently or negligently made representations which induced the company to enter into agreements related to the sale or purchase of Rangers season tickets, and claimed damages.

Mr Whyte, who took control of Rangers in May 2011, disputed the claim.

Ticketus has said that current proceedings are part of the company's 'continued activity to enforce' a judgment 'for damages of £17.7 million' against Mr Whyte.

As he left the court, reporters then asked if he thought that Rangers would return to the top.

He said 'inevitably'. And asked if he was still and fan and would always support the club, he replied 'of course' and 'yes'. 

Mr Justice Newey said complaints against Mr Whyte would be examined at a later date.
