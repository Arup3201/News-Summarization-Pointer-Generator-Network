The war medals proudly worn by a Normandy veteran who broke out of his care home so he could attend last year's D-Day commemorations in France are being sold.

Bernard Jordan was nicknamed the Great Escaper after he absconded from his carers, caught a ferry to Caen and turned up in Normandy for the 70th anniversary events with his service awards pinned to his blazer.

He passed away aged 90 on December 30 and seven days later his widow, Irene, passed away. With no immediate family, the couple left his £600,000 estate to lifeboat charity the RNLI.

Mr Jordan's campaign medals are to be sold at auction - and they could fetch thousands of pounds

Now his campaign medals are to be sold at auction - and they could fetch thousands of pounds.

Mr Jordan was a 19-year-old Royal Navy lieutenant when on June 6, 1944, he was on a tank landing craft that was in the first wave of boats to hit the Normandy beaches.

He had already taken part in the Battle of the Atlantic, the cat-and-mouse conflict between Allied ships and German U-boats over the vital supply routes from Europe to the United States.

At one stage he was part of the boarding party that captured one of the Enigma coding machines, used by the Nazis to scramble messages, from an enemy submarine.

He also served in the Italian campaign, supplying troops fighting their way north in an attempt to drive the Nazis from Europe.

Following the war Mr Jordan got into local politics and served as a town councillor for 23 years in his hometown of Hove, East Sussex.

The hero enjoyed posing with fans following his fame but remained humble throughout, insisting: 'There were a lot of other people on the beaches of Normandy that day, this lovely attention is for them really, not me'

He was a a city councillor for two years and was mayor of the town from 1995 to 1996.

Mr Jordan hit headlines in June last year when he went missing from his care home the day before the 75th anniversary D-Day celebrations.

He slipped out of The Pines care home in Hove, East Sussex, telling carers he was going for a walk. In reality, he caught a ferry to Caen in Normandy and made his own way to the service.

Police meanwhile had launched a missing persons appeal which was only called off when Mr Jordan called home to tell everyone he was ok.

On his return Mr Jordan was made an honorary alderman of Brighton and Hove and on his 90th birthday he was inundated with 2,500 cards from wellwishers around the world.

He died on December 30 last year, a week before Irene passed away.

More than 150 mourners turned out to pay their respects to Mr Jordan at a joint funeral service for him and Irene held in Brighton on January 30.

The RNLI said the legacy came as a 'huge surprise' but believed the couple's admiration stemmed from Mr Jordan's time in the Royal Navy in the Second World War.

Charity chief executive Paul Boissier said last month: ''Bernard's story charmed the nation last year when he journeyed from his Sussex care home to France to commemorate the D-Day landings. 

'I am delighted that the couple chose to leave us this sizeable donation, and their contribution, like those of Bernard's veteran peers, will never be forgotten.' 

Auctioneers at Wallis and Wallis in Lewes, East Sussex, say they are expecting lots of interest in the sale of Mr Jordan's medals from the UK and Europe, which has been brought by solicitors acting for his estate.

The set comprises of the 1939-1945 Star, the Atlantic Star with French and German clasp, the Italy Star, the Defence Medal and the War Medal.

Upon his return to the UK following his trip to France, Mr Jordan received thousands of cards and gifts

He was clapped and cheered by staff at Pines Care Home in Hove, East Sussex, after returning from France

The official estimate is £200 to £300 pounds but experts say the medal set could sell for thousands.

A spokesman for the auction house said: 'Bernard Jordan was a wonderful chap who really embodied the great British bulldog spirit.

'He proudly served his country both during the war as a Navy officer and afterwards as a councillor.

'Bernard really captured the nation's imagination when he escaped his care home and travelled to France to be part of the D-Day memorial last year.

'Medals such as these would normally only fetch a few hundred pounds but Bernard became something of a celebrity following his Normandy adventure and his set could sell for much more.'

The sale will be held on March 17. 

Bernard Jordan said he served on a destroyer in the Second World War hunting the 'wolf packs' of Nazi U-boats attacking Allied shipping convoys.

'I was once on a mission to recover one of the Enigma machines from a U-boat which we'd forced to the surface by dropping depth charges, and crippling it,' the 90-year-old Royal Navy veteran told friends.

'We boarded the submarine and recovered the machine.'

Exactly which ship he was serving on at the time was not clear, but the successful British mission to seize the German code machines and their codebooks has been credited with changing the course of the war.

Mr Jordan proudly wore his medals every day up until his death and spoke fondly of his time in the Navy

The first machine was seized by HMS Bulldog off Iceland in May 1941 when U-110 was forced to the surface and a boarding party seized the machine.

In another incident a few months later, HMS Petard sent a boarding party on board a U-boat, but two British sailors were drowned when the submarine sank.

Captured machines were taken to codebreakers at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire where they were able to intercept reams of encrypted German signals for years.

Up until his death, Mr Jordan - who captured the nation's hearts after sneaking out of his care home and boarding a coach to France to join in D-Day anniversary events - proudly wore his Atlantic Star medal.
