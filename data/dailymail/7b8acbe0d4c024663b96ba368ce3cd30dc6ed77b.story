Brendan Rodgers admitted that his ambition is to manage a club in Spain as the Liverpool boss revealed that he is already learning more Spanish.

Rodgers said in a stunning interview with Spanish newspaper AS that he wants to stay in charge at Anfield for the next 20 years but has already started preparing for a move abroad one day.

The 41-year-old Northern Irishman admitted that he tries to communicate with Liverpool's Spanish players - Jose Enrique, Alberto Moreno, Suso and Javi Manquillo - in their native language, rather than English.

Asked by AS where he sees himself in five years' time Rodgers said: 'I don’t know, I hope one day to work in Spain.

'I’ve studied Spanish, but I need to improve. I’ll probably improve when I work in the country one day. For most people, when they travel to a country their language becomes better.

'I speak to the Spanish players that we have in Spanish.'

Rodgers is gaining a reputation as one of the game's brightest young bosses but faces the biggest test of his managerial career so far when his Liverpool side host Real Madrid at Anfield in the Champions League on Wednesday night.

The Reds struggled to contain a QPR side featuring the likes of Bobby Zamora and Leroy Fer during Sunday's scrappy 3-2 victory at Loftus Road, but now he must find a way to stop the European champions with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, James Rodriguez and Karim Benzema in their ranks. Gareth Bale looks set to miss out through injury.

Rodgers, however, is relishing the challenge and views Liverpool's struggles to replicate last-season's stunning form as merely a blip in what he hopes will be a long stay at Anfield.

But he is also mapping out a career beyond the Barclays Premier League and already seems to have his heart set on a move to Spain - possibly to his opposition this week or their great rivals at Barcelona.

Barcelona would also another potential destination for Rodgers should he move to Spain as he plans

'I’m only 41 which is very young and there are lots of things I want to achieve here at Liverpool,' he said. 'It's an incredible club and I hope to be managing here for another 20-odd years.

'One day hopefully it can take me to Spain and I can experience a wonderful country, culture and as I said, some wonderful football club.'
