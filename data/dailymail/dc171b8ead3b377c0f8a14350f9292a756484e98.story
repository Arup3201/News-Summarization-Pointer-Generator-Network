How many lightning strikes are taking place around the world every minute? If your answer is anything less than 300, you're in for a shock.

A stunning interactive map has revealed just how much of Earth is subjected to lightning strikes every second, with an average of five taking place at any one time.

And the scientists behind the map also want to use it to work out what effect climate change is having on thunderstorms, and how much lightning is due to increase by 2100.

Below is the animation that you can use to view lightning strikes around the world, as recorded in October 2014 

 

To create the map, Professor Colin Price of Tel Aviv University's Department of Geosciences and TAU graduate student Keren Mezuman used the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN). This is a vast global lightning network of 70 weather stations run by atmospheric scientists at universities and research institutes around the world 

To create the map, Professor Colin Price of Tel Aviv University's Department of Geosciences and TAU graduate student Keren Mezuman used the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN).

This is a vast global lightning network of 70 weather stations run by atmospheric scientists at universities and research institutes around the world.

It is capable of detecting radio waves produced by lightning - the main feature of a thunderstorm - from thousands of miles away.

The TAU team harnessed this ground-based system to cluster individual lightning flashes into ‘thunderstorm cells.’

Every hour the exact GPS time of every detected lightning pulse was registered.

Professor Price and his colleagues then calculated the difference in arrival times of signals, using data from four to five different stations to locate individual lightning strokes anywhere on the globe.

Finally, the researchers grouped the detected flashes into clusters of thunderstorm cells.

The map shows a record of lightning over a specific time, although it should be noted it is not in real-time.

This map shows lightning strikes at the present time. Lightning stroke positions are shown as coloured dots, which 'cool down' from blue for the most recent (occurring within the last 10 minutes) through green and yellow to red for the oldest (30 to 40 minutes earlier). Red asterisks in white circles are active  sensor locations. The terminator, or boundary between day and night, in grey and black respectively

‘When we clustered the lighting strikes into storm cells, we found that there were around 1,000 thunderstorms active at any time somewhere on the globe,’ said Professor Price.

The researchers, pooling seven years of data analysis, found that every day lightning activity on earth peaked at 1900 UTC, with low activity at 0300 UTC every day. 

While previous studies had estimated 90 per cent of lightning flashes occurred over land areas, the TAU team found that only 50 per cent of the thunderstorms cells existed over land areas, implying that land storms have much more lightning than ocean storms.

‘How lightning will be distributed in storms, and how the number and intensity of storms will change in the future, are questions we are working on answering,’ Professor Price said.

Research by the University of Reading in November 2014 found over a five-year period the UK experienced around 50 per cent more lightning strikes when the Earth's magnetic field was skewed by the sun's own magnetic field.

Dr Matt Owens said: 'We've discovered that the sun's powerful magnetic field is having a big influence on UK lightning rates.' 

The findings could pave the way for an accurate forecasting system to warn of possible electrical storms many weeks in advance. 

The research will likely be crucial to measuring the impact of climate change on thunderstorms.

The varying frequency and intensity of thunderstorms have direct repercussions for the public, agriculture, and industry.

‘To date, satellites have only provided snapshots of thunderstorm incidence,’ said Professor Price, whose new map of thunderstorms around the world is the first of its kind.

‘We want to use our algorithm to determine how climate change will affect the frequency and intensity of thunderstorms.

‘According to climate change predictions, every one per cent rise in global temperature will lead to a 10 per cent increase in thunderstorm activity.

‘This means that we could see 25 per cent more lightning by the end of the century.’

While lightning might seem like it's rare on Earth, travel to space and it's a whole different story.

There, as astronauts orbit Earth, they can see a huge amount of lightning down below, and in a recent video and images Esa revealed some of the views astronauts are afforded.

An incredible series of images was captured by astronaut André Kuipers on the ISS on 11 June 2012, during Expedition 31. Lightning was captured over Eastern Romania (shown) at about 8:55pm UTC, and a video was made by stitching together 49 images taken on the ISS while travelling at 17,100mph (27,600km/h)

Estimates suggest that 100 discharges can occur between the system of clouds and the surface of Earth each second, causing many lightning strikes, so for astronauts seeing such a sight is not all too rare. Shown is another image by André Kuipers

The incredible series of images was captured by Dutch Esa astronaut André Kuipers on the ISS on 11 June 2012, during Expedition 31.

The lightning was captured over Eastern Romania at about 8:55pm UTC, and a video was made by stitching together 49 images taken on the ISS while travelling at 17,100 mph (27,600 km/h).

Estimates suggest that 100 discharges can occur between the system of clouds and the surface of Earth each second, causing many lightning strikes, so for astronauts seeing such a sight is not all too rare.

As the clouds are so vast, however, they are not always visible from the surface. But from the ISS the lightning is much more visible - and when astronauts orbit Earth, they can often spot lightning in clouds from above.

The pictures followed amazing images of lighting in the eye of a cyclone revealed in January, also captured by an astronaut on the ISS. The incredible views of tropical cyclone Bansi were spotted in the Indian Ocean near the island of Mauritius, when the ISS was east of Madagascar.

In the images the calm ‘eye’ of the storm can be seen illuminated by lightning and surrounded by swirling clouds as it made its way across the ocean.

They were taken by Italian European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti aboard the ISS in January this year. They show the swirling motion of the storm around the central blue eye.

According to Nasa, the wall of the eye is being illuminated by a flash of lightning in the centre of the storm - which also lights up nearby clouds. The low-light settings of the camera used to take the image accentuate the contrast.
