A schoolboy almost severed a major artery in his arm after impaling himself on a door handle as he ran along a hallway at home. 

William Tattersall, 12, caught his left forearm on the metal handle, lodging it under the skin just millimetres away from a major artery.

The boy said he thought he had simply caught his arm behind the handle after experiencing a dull pain but was horrified to discover the freak injury.

William Tattersall lies in hospital with the door handle still impaled in his arm close to a major artery

Firefighters and paramedics were called to the home on Friday afternoon and the handle had to be removed from the door.

William, who was taken to hospital with the handle still lodged in his arm, said: 'It felt quite painful and I was worrying thinking it would be quite serious. 

'I felt like I was going to collapse.It was just a blunt pain.'

The metal handle had lodged under the skin of the underside of William’s arm, yet it did not draw any blood.

Luckily for the youngster his mother Alex and older brother James, who are both nurses, were at home and able to reassure him that everything was going to be okay.

James, 23, a nurse at Chorley Hospital, in Lancashire, said: 'It could have pierced a major artery so it could have been a lot more serious. 

'What happened beggars belief. We were all in shock.'

Mother Alex said: 'I could see from the way it had gone in it wasn’t going to do any lasting damage. 'It wasn’t gory, it was so neatly in it was as if it had been professionally put there.'

The freak accident gave the biggest shock to dad Simon, who was out at work at the time.

William, who is now recovering at home in Blackpool, Lancashire, said the injury looked worse than it was

He said: 'I got this text saying William had impaled his arm and he was in hospital.

'In A&E they said they’ve seen all sorts in their time but never anything quite like this.

'We can’t thank the emergency services and the staff at the hospital enough, they were marvellous.'

Manager Chris Wareing, from Forest Gate Fire Station, praised William’s bravery. He said: 'He was very calm and very brave.'

The wound is around the same size as a 10 pence piece and William had four stitches.

William, who is now recovering at home in Blackpool, Lancashire, added: 'I think it looked worse than it was.'

The family is now in the process of changing the door handles throughout the house.
