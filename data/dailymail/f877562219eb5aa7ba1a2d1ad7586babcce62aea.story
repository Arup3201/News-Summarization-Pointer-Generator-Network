Some people claim they’re born to sing, while others openly admit they’re tone deaf, but what if you could take a pill and become pitch perfect?

That was the basis for a recent study that wanted to test the effect mood-stabilising drugs had on a person’s ability to learn new skills.

Researchers from France, Canada and the UK gave valproic acid (VPA) - a known mood-stabliser - to participants before training them to identify musical pitches.

In tests, those who took VPA scored higher, and correctly identified more pitches, than those who were given a placebo drug.

Researchers gave participants a mood-stabilising drug before testing their ability to them to determine perfect, or absolute, musical pitch. Those who took the drug were able to accurately identify the correct pitch more often than those who took a placebo. Mozart, left, and Stevie Wonder, right, are said to posses absolute pitch

VPA is what’s called a 
histone-deacetylase or HDAC inhibitor.

It is used to treat depression, 
epilepsy and bipolar disorder by altering how the brain reacts to 
certain stimulants.

According to the study, the optimum age to develop absolute pitch (AP) is between the ages of four and six.

This age range is known as the ‘critical period’ and is when the brain has what’s called ‘neural plasticity.’

By proving VPA can restore this plasticity could help doctors develop new neurological drugs.

VPA contains histone-deacetylase, or HDAC, inhibitor. It is used to treat depression, epilepsy and bipolar disorder by altering how the brain reacts to certain stimulants.

According to the study, the optimum age to develop absolute pitch (AP) is between the ages of four and six.

This is known as the 'critical period' and is when the brain still has 'neural plasticity', and can absorb, process and develop certain complex skills.

This includes the ability to learn how to recognise and identify different musical pitches accurately.

Famous musicians with absolute pitch include Mozart and Stevie Wonder.

The 24 participants who took part in the study were ‘healthy, right-handed, monolingual, English-speaking adult males.’

According to the research, only males were included due to the health risks VPA might have on pregnant women.

Each participant was shown a video designed to teach them to associate pitch classes from the 12-tone musical system. Each of the notes C, D, E, F#/Gb, G#/Ab, A#/Bb were assigned a proper name including Sarah, David, Francine, Jimmy, Karen, and Leo, Eric, Rachel, Tyler, Irene, Owen, and Peggy, pictured

Of these 24 subjects, 11 took valproic acid (VPA) and 12 took a placebo drug during training and testing.

None of the participants had received any complete musical training, and those who reported having partial training did not have any training during the critical period.

Participants were then tested on what they had learnt. During the first test, participants who took valproate scored five out of seven, on average, compared to the placebo's score of 3.5, pictured

Each participant was shown a training video designed to teach participants to associate six pitch classes from the 12-tone Western musical system.

For example, each of the notes C, D, E, F#/Gb, G#/Ab, A#/Bb were assigned a proper name over different octaves.

These names included Sarah, David, Francine, Jimmy, Karen, and Leo and for the second they were Eric, Rachel, Tyler, Irene, Owen, and Peggy.

They were chosen because they were common first names and the first letters of each appears on the same row of a keyboard. Half of the names were female, and the other half male.

Training videos taught the participants which name corresponded with which pitch class. 

Participants were then tested on what they had learnt. During the first test, the six proper names appeared in a horizontal row on the screen in the same order for every subject.

Participants heard one synthesised piano tone per trial, for a total of 18 trials, in a semi-randomized order.

Following each tone, participants had to identify the proper name associated with the pitch class of the tone by pressing the keyboard key corresponding to the first letter of the associated name.

More than half of the responses correctly identified the exact pitch in the valproate group, left, while in the placebo group, right, the results were more evenly spread across a -3 and +3 range

During tests, participants who took valproate scored five out of seven, on average, compared to the placebo’s score of 3.5.

More than half of the responses correctly identified the exact pitch in the valproate group, while in the placebo group, the results were more evenly spread across a -3 and +3 range.

In conclusion, the researchers said: ‘Our study is the first to show a change in absolute pitch with any kind of drug treatment.

‘The finding that VPA can restore plasticity in a fundamental perceptual system in adulthood provides compelling evidence that one of the modes of action for VPA in psychiatric treatment may be to facilitate reorganization and rewiring of otherwise firmly established pathways in the brain.’
