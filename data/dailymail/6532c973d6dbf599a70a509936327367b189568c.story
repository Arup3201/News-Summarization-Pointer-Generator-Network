Tamir Rice, 12, was fatally shot by police in Cleveland after brandishing what turned out to be a BB gun

A Cleveland officer was less than 10 feet away when he fatally shot a 12-year-old boy carrying a pellet gun near a playground, police said Monday.

A surveillance video of Tamir Rice's last moments before he was shot on Saturday has been shown to representatives of his family, after they declined to watch their son's shooting.

Tamir Rice, was confronted Saturday by officers responding to a 911 call about a male who appeared to be pulling a gun in and out of his pants.

The 911 caller said the gun was 'probably fake,' then added, 'I don't know if it's real or not.' 

Deputy Chief Edward Tomba said Monday that he didn't know whether a dispatcher shared that information with responding officers.

The president of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association has said the officers weren't told the caller thought the gun might be fake.

Tamir, who died Sunday, had an 'airsoft' gun that appeared indistinguishable from a real firearm.

Airsoft guns fire spherical plastic pellets and have orange tips to show they aren't real firearms, but police said the one the boy had didn't have the bright safety indicator.

They say the boy was told to raise his hands and was shot when he pulled the pellet gun from his waistband, though he hadn't pointed it at police or made verbal threats.

'Our officers at times are required to make critical decisions in a split second,' Chief Calvin Williams said.

'Unfortunately this is one of those times.'

Tomba said surveillance video of the shooting is 'very clear' about what occurred, but he wouldn't discuss details of what it shows.

Police didn't release the video publicly because it is evidence in the investigation and because they want to be sensitive to the family, the community and the officer, who is distraught, officials said.

The two officers involved in the shooting were put on administrative leave under standard procedure.

Police haven't publicly identified them.

The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that the officers are a first-year rookie and a 10-year department veteran. 

Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams  said he spoke to the officer who shot the boy last night: '[He is] holding up pretty well but is broken up about this,' Williams said, adding that the officer 'didn't want to do this, but had to protect himself.'

The shooting has led to an investigation of the officer's use of force.

It also contributed to a state lawmaker's plan to propose legislation requiring all BB guns, air rifles and airsoft guns sold in Ohio to be brightly colored or have prominent fluorescent strips.

The police department has collected surveillance video and other evidence and will present it to the county prosecutor's office, the newspaper said without citing a source. 

It said after reviewing the evidence prosecutors will present the case to a grand jury, which will decide whether the officer was justified in using force against the boy.

Once the investigation is complete, the case will be presented to a grand jury to decide whether any criminal charges should be brought, Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty said.  

An attorney for the boy's family, Timothy Kucharski, said Tamir went to the park with friends Saturday afternoon, but he did not know the details of what led to his shooting.

He said 'an innocent boy was shot and killed' by a rookie officer. According to 9 Action News both of the officers are white.

Kucharski said: 'This is not a black and white issue. This is a right and wrong issue. This is not a racial issue. 

'This is about people doing their jobs the right way.'

'I don't want to make a rush to judgment,' he said. 

Kucharski said he wants to talk to witnesses himself and get more facts.

'We're ultimately going to find out what happened,' he said.

On Sunday Tamir's father Gregory Henderson said the youngster had his whole life ahead of him when he was gunned down.

Wiping away tears, he said: 'Who would've thought he would go so soon? He had his whole life ahead. To be 12 years old, he doesn't know what he's doing. Police, they know what they're doing.'

He added that he was still shocked at the death of his 'superhero', whom he described as a keen basketball player who was tall for his size, polite and 'very artistic'.

'I'm trying not to cry about the situation but the situation hurts,' he told WKYC.com, adding that he wished police had Tasered his son instead of immediately shooting him.

On Sunday, Tamir's family and friends - some of whom had been holding a vigil at the hospital for the youngster - were spotted bringing posters, candles and teddy bears to the area.

'I went to church today and I said a prayer for him and, as soon as I come home, he's dead,' said Kerby Williams, who lives near the scene of the shooting. 

On Monday, Cleveland's website was hacked and a YouTube video purporting to be from the hacker collective Anonymous was posted referencing website shutdowns and the shooting.

City spokesman Daniel Ball said the city couldn't confirm who shut down the site.

 He said the city was adding extra security measures to prevent a repeat shutdown before restoring the website.

State Rep. Alicia Reece of Cincinnati announced Sunday that she will introduce legislation to require all BB guns, air rifles and airsoft guns sold in Ohio to be brightly colored or have prominent fluorescent strips.

 It is modeled after a bill signed by California Gov. Jerry Brown.

Reece said she is introducing the bill in response to the fatal shootings of the boy and 22-year-old John Crawford III.

Crawford was fatally shot by police August 5 after a man called 911 to report that Crawford was carrying a gun in a suburban Dayton Wal-Mart store. 

Police said they believed the air rifle Crawford had picked up was a real rifle and that he didn't respond to commands to drop it.

A special grand jury concluded police officers' actions were justified. 

The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the shooting.
