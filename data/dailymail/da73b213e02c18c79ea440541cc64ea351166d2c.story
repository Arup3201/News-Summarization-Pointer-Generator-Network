Newcastle’s Siem de Jong hopes the fitness problems which cost him a place at the World Cup in the wake of a ‘scary’ collapsed lung are now firmly behind him.

The former Ajax captain was diagnosed with the problem at the start of last season having complained of persistent tightness and coughing.

De Jong was absent for five weeks and, when he did return, was plagued by niggling injuries for the remainder of the campaign, culminating in him missing out on Louis van Gaal’s squad for Brazil.

But United’s £6million signing has enjoyed an impressive start to life on Tyneside and will again be on show when Alan Pardew’s men join hosts Schalke, West Ham and Malaga for a four-team tournament in Germany this weekend.

‘It was quite scary,’ said the 25-year-old reflecting on his collapsed lung just under a year ago.

‘It happened at the beginning of the season, and after the collapsed lung I had to be in bed for a couple of weeks.

‘Looking back, afterwards we didn’t focus enough on my entire body and focused too much on the lung.

‘The lung was good after three weeks, and the rest of the body just wasn’t strong enough to play games, and that’s what we forgot a little.’

He told the Shields Gazette: ‘During the season I had some other small injuries which was part of not being strong enough.

‘But I think I trained the last half of the year really hard at Ajax, and now I need a good pre-season to build up strength.

‘That’s what I missed a little bit last year, so it’s an important time for me to hopefully be stronger than I was.’
