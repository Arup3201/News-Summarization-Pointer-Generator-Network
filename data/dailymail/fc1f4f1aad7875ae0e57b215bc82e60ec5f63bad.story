Survivor: Mohammed, whose name has been changed out of fears for his safety, was forced to attend an Islamic State children's camp

A survivor of an Islamic State children's camp today revealed how young boys are being lashed with whips and forced to watch the executions of men and women.

Mohammed, whose name has been changed out of fears for his safety, was just 13 when he was made to attend one of the terror group's camps in northern Syria.

Under supervision by militants, he was taught the Quran, trained in the use of weapons and forced to watch men being crucified and women stoned to death.

He was also made to take oaths of allegiance to ISIS leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and witness boys younger than himself being 'brought to the camp and lashed'.

Today, Mohammed, who was eventually pulled out of the camp after 30 days by his father and later fled to Turkey with his family, described some of his horrific experiences there.

'When we go to the mosque, they order us to come the next day at a 
specific time and place to [watch] heads cut off, lashings or stonings,' he told CNN.

'We
 saw a young man who did not fast for Ramadan, so they crucified him for
 three days, and we saw a woman being stoned [to death] because she 
committed adultery.'

Donning a brown t-shirt and fidgeting with his hands, Mohammed said he had not understood some of the words the militants had used, such as 'infidels', nor why he should fight them.

Shockingly, he added that one of his friends at the camp had been killed on the front line while trying to help ISIS defeat the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

'He was martyred in Deir Ezzor when he fought 
the Free Syrian Army with ISIS. He was my age, 13 or 14
 years old,' he said.

Mohammed's father, who did not wish to be named, said ISIS had told him that if he prevented his son from attending the camp, they would 'cut off' his head.

He added that he had tried to visit his son several times a day out of fears for his well-being, but had been turned away by militants.

It comes as a rising number of young Syrians are being recruited by the militant group for roles ranging from soldiers and snipers to stretcher bearers and suicide bombers.

Earlier 
this year, Human Rights Watch said the extremist Nusra Front and the 
Islamic State have both targeted children as young as 15 through 
education programs, which include military training.

The
 group, which said the number of children fighting in the conflict is 
unknown, based its report on interviews with 25 children and former 
child soldiers in Syria.

ISIS continues to terrorise rivals and civilians alike with widely publicized brutality in Syria and Iraq as it seeks to expand a proto-state it has carved out on both sides of the border.Â 

It frequently publishes graphic photos and videos of everything from bombings and beheadings to mass killings and images of jihadis taunting and humiliating terrified troops or other opponents.

This afternoon, sickening footage emerged appearing to show ISIS militants parading around 250 captured soldiers through the desert in their underwear before killing them.

A militant fighter claimed the men were from the Syrian government's Tabqa air base which extremists seized on Sunday, potentially handing them warplanes, tanks, artillery and ammunition.

The video, which has not been 
independently verified, shows dozens of men being marched through the 
desert wearing only their underwear.

It then fades to black, resuming with a pile of bloodied bodies stacked on top of one another.

The precise death toll is uncertain and other sources put it at lower than 250, but at least 150 bodies are visible in the shaky.

An Islamic State fighter in Raqqa told Reuters: 'Yes we have executed them all'.
