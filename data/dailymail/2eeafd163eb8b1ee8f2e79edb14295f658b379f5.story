More than one in four incapacity benefit claimants have been found ‘fit for work’ following new medical examinations.

Of the 841,000 who have been re-tested, about 227,000 were well enough to come off the benefit, said the Department for Work and Pensions.

A further 346,500 were found likely to be fit for work at some point and have been placed in an interim, ‘work-related activity’, group. They will be re-tested more often and get support or training to move into employment.

The figures were seen yesterday as an indictment of how previous governments let the unemployed languish on sickness benefits without regular health checks to see whether they had recovered.

Those found fit for work will now go on to Jobseekers’ Allowance, which means they will have to show they are looking for employment to stay on the benefit.

Ministers are anxious to get the burgeoning welfare bill down, but disability rights campaigners have pointed to the high number of successful appeals against DWP decisions as evidence that the system is unfair.

Mike Penning, the minister for disabled people, said: ‘We spend more than £13billion on sickness and incapacity benefits for almost 2.5million people of working age and  we need to make sure that support goes to those who need it most.

‘It’s right that we look at whether people can do some kind of work with the right support – rather than just writing them off on long-term sickness benefits, as has happened in the past.’

Separately, among those on the new Employment and Support Allowance benefit  – for people who have a limited capability for work because of a health condition or disability – 42 per cent were found to be fit for employment.

This meant they were no longer eligible to claim, leaving just 58 per cent still entitled to the benefit.

To continue claiming the ESA, most people had to be reassessed by independent health professionals, under  a programme that started in 2010. 

Those with terminal illnesses, severe disabilities or undergoing chemotherapy were spared from having  to be re-assessed, but the tests – called the Work Capability Assessment – have proved controversial.

Figures from the latest quarter show that almost 33,000 ESA applicants who went for an independent assessment with a health professional were found fit for work. Almost 70,000 who applied for the ESA withdrew their claims before they were tested.

Liz Sayce, chief executive  of Disability Rights UK,  said: ‘The Work Capability Assessment asks questions like “can you raise either  arm to the top of the head  as if to put on a hat or  mount or descend two  steps unaided?”

‘But there is no evidence this has any bearing on whether you can actually work. It depends on the job and whether you get the adjustments and support you need to do it [such as a lift to get up the steps].

‘Many disabled people can work with the right support – and want to – but the test itself is a shocking waste of taxpayers’ money.’

Kaliya Franklin, a disability rights campaigner who has written a report exposing the ‘misery’ inflicted by the current testing regime, said: ‘I think we do need to have tests but they need to be fair and independent for everyone. We don’t want a system that is easy to play.

‘The biggest problem is that the DWP wrote into the original contract with assessors ATOS that just 11 per cent of people can go into the support group [those who will continue to get disability benefit of some form].’

Officials insist that they have tried to improve the tests by working with medical experts and charities to make them more accurate.

Tests now also look at  mental health as well as physical conditions.
