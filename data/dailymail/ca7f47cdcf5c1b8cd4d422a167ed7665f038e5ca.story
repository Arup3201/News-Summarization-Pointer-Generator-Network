Positioned on the clifftops of Hawaii with stunning views and the calming sounds of the crashing waves, Kalaupapa would be the perfect location for any spa retreat.

But for the last 146 years, the small village has been used as a colony for leprosy patients, many of whom were torn from their families and banished to the idyllic peninsula for quarantine.

Kalaupapa, the world's first leper colony, had a population of 1,200 patients at its height and has treated more than 8,000 sufferers since it opened in 1866.

Banished: Children and adults stand outside Father Damien's church in the late 19th century when around 600 sufferers were shipped to the island

Much-admired: Father Damien, known as the leper priest of Molokai, was named a saint by the Roman Catholic Church in 2009

Now it caters for just 17 and the future of the place they fondly call home is uncertain.

They have chosen to speak out to coincide with the impending canonization later this month of Mother Marianne Cope, one of the many Catholic nuns who have ministered the settlement.

They told of burying spouses, having babies taken away and being treated like they were a 'monkey show'.

But despite the painful memories, most are still desperate to preserve their way of life.

'I've heard people say it would be a nice resort,' 81-year-old Barbara Marks told www.syracuse.com. 'I don't want them to do that to Kalaupapa. I don't want it to change. It's our home.'

Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease after physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen, is a chronic disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis.

Left untreated, the disease can cause permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs and eyes.

A common myth is that body parts can fall off, but it can cause limbs to become numb or diseased from secondary infections.

Although the form of transmission remains uncertain, it is thought to be through respiratory droplets.

The World Health Organization estimated that in 1995 between two and three million people were permanently disabled because of leprosy.

In the past 20 years, 15 million people have been cured of leprosy worldwide.

Elroy Malo, now 77, went to Kalupapa, a peninsula on the island of Molokai, when he was 12.

He lost the use of his hands and feet and became blind at 30, but says his time at the colony was 'fabulous'.

Mr Malo, who now lives at a state-run
extension of Kalaupapa due to his poor health, said: 'We could go 
hiking and hunting in valleys and swim anytime.

'We went spear-fishing. We were just stranded there, and yet I loved it,' he told www.syracuse.com.

Some, like Clarence Kahilihwa, however, say they felt 'dirty' and regarded the village like a prison.

The
colony opened a year after Hawaii's King Kamehameha V brought in the 
Act to Prevent the Spread of Leprosy to enforce the exile of sufferers.

By
1873, when Father Damien, the only other Roman Catholic from the island
to be made a saint, began working on Kalaupapa, about 600 patients had 
been shipped there.

The population later reached a high of 1,200 in 1890 after Mother Marianne was overseeing her ministry.

But
since the introduction of new medication in the 1940s, few patients 
were sent there and the quarantine was eventually lifted in 1969.

Patients were free to leave, but many didn't want to.

'I had a lot of sadness, but my life was not all bad,' Marks said.
