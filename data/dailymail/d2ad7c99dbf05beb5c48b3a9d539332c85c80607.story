Sephora cosmetic emporium has been taking the world by storm and now it's Australia's turn with a Sydney store set to open just 20 days before Christmas.

Australian women will be flocking to the Westfield Shopping Centre in Sydney's Pitt Street mall come December 5 with the alluring temptation of the most luxurious and niche products on offer in the one non-stop beauty superstore which will span two storeys.

It begs the question - will the most die-hard of cosmetic fans camp over night outside the store to be the first experience the free samples and makeovers - not to mention the ever-attentive and stunning beauty consultants?
