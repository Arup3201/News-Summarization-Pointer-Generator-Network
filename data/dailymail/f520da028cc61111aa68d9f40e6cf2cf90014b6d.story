Australian model Miranda Kerr ruffled a few fashion feathers when she replaced supermodel Kate Moss as the face of high street label Mango last winter.

And now, after she proved a major hit with customers, the Spanish fashion chain has confirmed that the dimple-cheeked brunette, 30, will continue as the face of Mango for its autumn/winter campaign.

In the shot released to accompany the announcement Kerr is dishevelled but still sexy in a pair of distressed jeans, mannish layering and some stacked flatforms from the new season collection.

Talking about the latest pictures the model and business woman, who is married to actor Orlando Bloom, 36, said, 'I had a great time shooting the Fall/Winter campaign.'

'The clothing is especially fun this 
season with a punk-inspired edge. I loved that Inez and Vinoodh kept the
look of the campaign very raw and natural and I think it compliments 
the collection well.'

Kerr joins a long roster of fashionistas who've also modeled for Mango, including Scarlett Johansson, Penelope Cruz, Milla Jovovich, Naomi Campbell, Eva Herzigova, Claudia Schiffer and Christy Turlington.

The Spring/Summer collection was shot in
early May by acclaimed photographers Inez and Vinoodh. New York 
provides the backdrop for clothes that match floral prints and pastel 
tones with a gritty punk aesthetic.

Kerr recently parted ways with Victoria's Secret after six years with the brand, but has insisted there wasn't a falling out and it was simply time to move on. She is an established businesswoman and has launched an organic skincare line, Kora.

The model was recently spotted in New York enjoying a day out with her family, including husband Orlando and two-year-old baby son Flynn.
