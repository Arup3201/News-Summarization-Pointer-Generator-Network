A government adviser has said that children should not be allowed to watch television in their bedrooms or on mobiles or tablets.

Dame Maggie Atkinson who was appointed Children's Commissioner four years ago and has previously said that smacking children should be illegal wants no more than two television sets in any home and a ban on gadgets at the dinner table.

She also said that although no one can halt the march of technology parents must be stricter with children and insist that they choose one programme that the whole family can watch.

Children should not have a television in their room says Dame Maggie Atkinson, the Children's Commissioner

‘When we’re all at the table switch it off,’ she demanded. ‘And when we’re all going to watch television there’s only going to be two in the house.

‘Choose. Not a telly in each hand and a telly in each room and atomised living.’

Dame Maggie, 57, also warned that government filters to stop children accessing pornography online could be vulnerable to hackers.

‘My grandma used to say “Don’t talk to strangers”. You have to go back to the good old human skill of “When am I safe? Who is this person? Why is he asking for my bank details or for me to take a picture of myself in a compromising position?”

‘Those are human skills. You can apply them on the web and you should be taught to.’
