A British property developer is to bring a little bit of Surrey to the Middle East by building £300million-worth of British-style mansions and apartments in Oman.

The Middle East kingdom will get a touch of English design thanks to a British house builder well known for its mansions across London and the Home Counties.

The developers say the mansions, described an Arab version of Kensington's famous Phillimores development, will set a new benchmark for quality and luxury for European style homes in the Oman property market.

But a little bit sunnier: The developers say the mansions, described an Arab version of Kensington's famous Phillimores development, will set a new benchmark for quality and luxury for European style homes in the Oman property market

Consero, best known for designing and building enormous mansions in Surrey, is to begin the development with 14 large contemporary villas set in landscaped gardens in Muscat, the Omani capital.

The upmarket house builder, which has teamed up with local developer the Al Raid group, is to start building the houses - expected to fetch up to £1million a unit - this summer.

Each of the properties, to be located in a prestigious district of Muscat, will be around 5,000sq/ft in size, surrounded by large terraces and set in landscaped gardens.

The joint venture will then focus on the development of a further 264 one and two bedroom apartments and penthouses in locations including Muscat, Shatti Al Qurum and Al Khuwair.

Sheikh Fahad Abdullah Al Araimi, chief executive of the Al Raid Group, said: 'We are delighted by this new agreement which will fuse the Al Raid Group's real estate strength, design excellence and local knowledge with the outstanding British product quality and innovation for which the Consero London brand is renowned.'

Luxury living: The Oman property market the company is entering is estimated to be worth more than £2.4billion per year

Consero is best known for designing and building enormous mansions in Surrey. Over the past decade the luxury developer has apparently built and sold luxury properties valued at more than £1 billion.

Last year it unveiled plans to build a £60 million mega-mansion near Ascot which is more than 45 times the size of the average new home.

Windlesham House will boast 15 enormous bedrooms, all with en suite, and ten reception rooms with accommodation.

Robert Osborn, co-founding director of Consero London, said: 'Our companies have entered into this exciting joint venture following the success of an Oman-based pilot project where Saraya and Consero London worked alongside each other.

'This Oman pilot project created a luxurious 12,000 sq/ft mansion which took three years to build and was completed in December 2014.

'This joint development demonstrated to the boards of both companies that we work well together and the fusion of our skill-sets creates a real estate product of exceptional quality.

'We have developed an excellent relationship with Saraya who are a leading specialist in high quality architectural design and project management in Oman.'
