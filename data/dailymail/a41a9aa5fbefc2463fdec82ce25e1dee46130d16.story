A music teacher murdered his fiancée and hid her body in a suitcase to convince a second lover that he was a single parent living alone, a court heard.

Andrew Lindo, 29, throttled Marie Stewart as she lay in bed, smashed her on the head with his daughter’s Winnie-the-Pooh chair and finally stabbed her while their two children slept.

He hid 30-year-old Miss Stewart’s body in a suitcase in the garage then calmly picked up– the other woman he called his ‘future wife’ – and took her home to spend the night with him.

A week later, on Christmas Day, Miss Stewart’s father and other relatives  visited Lindo.

He convinced them she was suffering from post-natal depression and had left him and the children to be with another man, Bradford Crown Court heard.

But almost two months later Miss Stewart’s family called in the police.

They searched Lindo’s home in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, and found her decomposing body.

Lindo admitted killing her, claiming he ‘lost his self-control’ because he believed she was abusing their three-year-old daughter.

He denies murder but admits manslaughter.

'Mutual attraction': Lindo was seeing Angela Rylance at the time he is alleged to have killed his fiancee

Lindo was an ‘inveterate and accomplished liar’ who lived a double life with a ‘series of hapless women’, Michelle Colborne QC, prosecuting, told the court.

He had simultaneous relationships with two other women he met at work, Amy Wilde and Alison Doram, when Miss Stewart was pregnant with their second child.

Six months later he met Angela Rylance, who worked at the Money Shop in Barnsley where Lindo cashed his pay cheques.

There was a ‘mutual attraction’ and 
Lindo convinced her that Miss  Stewart had walked out on the family 
within two weeks of giving birth, and that he was single.

For the next four months he played 
out an elaborate charade, pretending to  Miss Stewart, a classroom 
assistant, that he was faithful to her, and telling Miss Rylance that 
she was the only woman  in his life.

Miss Rylance spent time in his house 
and with his children on many occasions, the court heard.

Miss Stewart 
became suspicious when her daughter mentioned ‘Angela’, but he said it 
was due to the child’s fertile imagination.

Abandoned: Marie Stewart's body was left in this garage for two months

Eight days before the killing Miss Stewart phoned a friend, crying hysterically, and said she had proof Lindo was cheating on her.

The friend phoned Miss Rylance, who confirmed the relationship and promised not to see Lindo again.

Lindo again brazenly lied to Miss Rylance and assured her he loved her and that he had taken legal advice over Miss Stewart’s ‘harassment’ of him, the court heard.

But Miss Rylance was dubious and told him that until she spent a night at his house her doubts would remain.

They made a date for that overnight stay for a week later on Saturday, December 18.

In the week leading up to the killing Lindo sent texts to Miss Stewart to try to keep her happy.

One said: ‘I’m sorry baby, I want us to work so much. I’ll try harder.’ Another said: ‘Love you darling.’

On the evening of the murder, neighbours heard Lindo and Miss Stewart arguing, and the prosecution said this row ended in murder.

Describing the killing to police, Lindo said he started to squeeze Miss Stewart’s neck ‘whilst placing his arm over her eyes so that she wasn’t looking at him’. She turned purple and went silent. Then she started making a noise again.

He heaved her into a suitcase and managed to drag it down the stairs.

Court: Lindo is on trial at Bradford Crown Court

He said the noises from Miss Stewart started again and he thought: ‘I can’t strangle you, I’m obviously s*** at strangling you, I’m just going to hit you.’

He smashed her over the head with his daughter’s wooden chair, but she came round again.

As his helpless victim’s body began to move he spotted some bubble wrap.

Describing the killing as ‘undoubted torture’, Miss Colborne said: ‘The defendant said that the only thing he could think of doing was to cut her throat, just to stop it.

‘He wrapped the bubble wrap round her head because he didn’t want to see her face, didn’t want her looking at him. He said he grabbed a knife and jabbed it in.’

The court was told that after cleaning the murder scene Lindo drove with his children about 20 miles to Barnsley, arriving at Miss Rylance’s house at 11pm.

He told her he was so late because police had breath-tested him, and took his unsuspecting lover home with him.

They remade the bed where he had attacked his fiancée hours earlier and got into it.

The following day he spent ‘an entirely pleasant day’ with Miss Rylance ‘at the scene of the previous night’s brutality’, the jury heard.

Lindo then began building his cover story and ‘set in train an elaborate set of lies designed to blacken her name’.

He told the victim’s sister that she had taken her clothes from the house ‘and left with a man in a car’.

He told Miss Stewart’s GP she was ‘having fun in the sun’.

Lindo also texted Miss Stewart’s phone with the message: ‘Please come home baby I love you so much.’

Using her phone he allegedly texted a friend to reassure her: ‘Feeling a little better for being away for a bit. I’m safe.’

This friend was a police officer, and when Miss Stewart had not turned up by mid- February she spoke to the victim’s family and the police were called in.

The case continues.
