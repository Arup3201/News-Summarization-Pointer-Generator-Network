His Christmas menu last year consisted of edible fairy lights, tasty tinsel, pork baubles and a partridge in a pear tree.

And, odd as it may sound, the limited edition festive feast, served at Heston Blumenthal's restaurant Fat Duck in Bray, was such a success that the experimental chef is set to roll it out for a second year.

This year, the festive menu, created by Blumenthal, Head Chef Lake and their Experimental Kitchen team,  is different - but no less strange. 

Festive spirit: Last year's Christmas menu was such a success that Heston Blumenthal will be hosting a special Christmas lunch in his flagship restaurant in Bray, The Fat Duck, for a second year

Plum porridge, Gold, Frankincense and Myhrr and 
an advent candle are on the menu, with many of the dishes, Fat Duck Head Chef Jonny Lake tells MailOnline, inspired by (but not faithfully recreating) historic festive recipes.

'With any of these things it’s more about the idea,' he said. 'If you actually tried to follow the recipe, they wouldn't taste very nice.

'In fact, they are not recipes as we know them now; they sound more like a story. We adapt it; we make something new from it.'

The advent candle, which burns throughout the meal, is cut and served at the end - and found to be made of chocolate with a passionfruit caramel centre.

Mince pies with real spiced, sweetened meat are served towards the end of the meal, and plum porridge - which is a beef broth spiced with orange - served at the beginning.

A standard Christmas turkey lunch.....very unlike what you will get in Bray this December

And
 the Gold, Frankincense and Myhrr, which Jonny says was created by 
Blumenthal as one of his first festive dishes, consists of lobster 
consommé reduced until it is a jelly, wrapped in gold leaf and served 
like a gold bar in a stock made aromatic with frankincense (a resin from
 the Boswellia tree) and accompanied by a whiff of myhrr.

But will Jonny be bringing some of his wild concoctions into his own home on Christmas day? 'I'll be cooking a turkey,' he said. 'Cover it in gold? Nope. The most unusual thing I'll be doing with it is brining it.'

The
 Fat Duck - better known for its £195 tasting menu which features 
dishes such as snail porridge, red cabbage 
gazpacho, salmon poached in liquorice gel and Sound Of The Sea, which 
involves listening to an iPod while you eat - will offer the Christmas 
experience for three consecutive Sundays throughout December - 1, 8 and 15.

The menu is priced at £350 per person excluding drinks and service
 charge.

Describing the inspiration for 
the creation of his first festive feast last year, Blumenthal said: 'I'm basically a big kid. I'm not a 
scientist - I failed chemistry O-level - I'm just a bloke who likes to 
know how things work.

'And I think Christmas brings out the kids in all of us - that excitement and the smells and the memories.
