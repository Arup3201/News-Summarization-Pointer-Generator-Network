An 11-year-old boy has been banned from lessons with his classmates after teachers said that his hair had been cut too short.

Callum Freeman fell foul of 'zero-tolerance' rules at St Benedict Voluntary Catholic Academy in Derby after getting a haircut with ultra-short, grade one sides.

His mother, Sam Tillson, claims her son has been told he cannot rejoin his peers until his hair grows back because his short back and sides breaches the school's dress code.

Short: Callum Freeman sports the short-back-and-sides haircut that has led to him being banned from lessons

She accuses the school of putting her son into 'isolation' and has claimed he is falling behind in his education after being blocked from school.

She hasn't sent Callum to school since he was punished for the haircut. But teachers say that they still want him to attend school - just not in his regular classes.

Ms Tillson said: 'He had his hair cut during a day off last week. He had it shorter than usual because he doesn’t like having it cut and it would save going again in the near future.

'I wasn’t aware that pupils could not have a grade one cut, which this is, I thought it would only be wrong if his head was fully shaved or coloured.

'He was put into isolation when he went back to school last Friday and I arranged for his grandfather to fetch him home the same day and he hasn’t been back since.

'I was told he couldn’t return until it grew again but that could be weeks and he is already behind in his lessons.'

St Benedict Voluntary Catholic Academy in Derby: Teachers say that Callum is not banned from school, merely not allowed in regular classes - and they still want him to attend

St Benedict's headteacher Dr Chris Reynolds said Callum had not been isolated and that merely placed in an ‘opportunities room’, instead of his normal timetable.

'We have a zero-tolerance policy towards breaking school rules,' he said.

'This will result in pupils being placed in our opportunities room, which is not isolation, where there are several other pupils and a teacher.

'He has not been told that he cannot be in school and we would far sooner have Callum here.'
