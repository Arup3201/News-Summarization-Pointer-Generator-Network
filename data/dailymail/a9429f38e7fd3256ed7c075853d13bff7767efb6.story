A father whose eye-popping act became a YouTube sensation has his sights set on smashing a world record.

John Doyle has had thousands of online views after posting videos showing off his astonishing ability to make his eyes bulge out from his head. 

One, set to the Daft Punk track Get Lucky, is closing in on half a million views, while Mr Doyle, from Rainhill, near Liverpool, has featured on U.S. TV and was even flown out to appear on screen in Japan.

Freaky: John Doyle, known as Mr Zoom, has discovered he can pop he eyes out independently of each other

The eyes have it: The father-of-one has posted videos of his strange and rather disturbing 'talent' online, popping his eyes out to music

Now the 30-year-old, who first discovered his unusual talent performing for regulars at the Coach and Horses pub near his home, wants official recognition for his skills.

He believes he has beaten the world record, but has so far been unable to get the feat documented.

Mr Doyle said: 'Guinness World Records have quite strict criteria so it is tough to meet their standards.

'While in Japan, I believe I beat the 
world record for how far eyes can come out, which is currently 12 
millimetres but due to the language barrier it was hard to get it 
recorded accurately.'

YouTube sensation: Mr Doyle, has recorded and posted online his latest 'dancing' eyes video to his website and on YouTube

For your eyes only: In his videos, he squeezes his eyeballs out one at a time and moves them in different directions to the music

The father-of-one, who works in internet marketing, said the skill came to him about two years ago.

He added: 'I was doing it for friends in the pub and just put it on YouTube one day. 

'I found I was getting emails from lots of different people commenting on it.

'Suddenly
 it had had a hundred views, then the figure kept going up and up and I 
was getting dozens of emails every couple of hours.

In demand: Mr Zoom's web page has caused quite a stir and TV producers all over the world have been showing an interest

Record breaking: Mr Doyle's eyes have been measured to pop out by more than a centimetre; now he is trying to tick all the boxes to be awarded a Guinness World Record for his bizarre talent

'It just took off. I was featured on TV in America and Ripley's Believe it or Not contacted me. I never expected it would be as popular as this.'

Newlywed John says he is hoping to build on the videos' success and put his skills to further use.

He said: 'I have spoken to some people in London and we are looking to identify opportunities for the future, but there is nothing definite planned just yet.'
