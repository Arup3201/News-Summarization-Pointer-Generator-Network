That feeling of elation when handing over money at the till as the shop assistant puts your new dress into a bag, followed by that sinking feeling when you next look at your bank balance - millions of us have been there. 

But new research has shown the situation may be worse than previously thought - one in four women have admitted to being addicted to shopping and say they lie about how much they spend. 

But is it any surprise when it gives ladies such a rush? The new study into 2,000 ladies found a third were at their happiest when spending money on new clothes.

The addiction isn't purely about the clothes though, it's also down to the effect it has on the body.

45 per cent of those questioned get a genuine rush of excitement when they purchase new clothes, shoes and accessories.

And while many credit having children, a rewarding career or being in love as making them truly happy, a third of women claim that nothing beats the buzz of strutting out of a shop swinging a bag full of new purchases.

It seems we can't switch off from thinking about items we want in our wardrobe either once catching sight of something online or in a store.  

The longest the average woman avoids buying new clothes is two and a half months (picture posed by model)

Over half of British women said when they see something they like either on a website or in a shop they can’t stop thinking about it and 17 per cent revealed they even dream about clothes they are coveting. 

The poll by LoveSales.com - a shopping site that monitors items on all the top retailer websites in the UK and alerts you when they drop in price - found the typical female ‘watches’ an item of clothing for at least seven days before buying.

More than one in twenty even print out a picture of the must have item and pin it up at home or at work.

1. If it’s replacing something that I have worn to death I should replace it

2. If I can buy it outright and not go in to debt to buy it - I should have it

3. If it goes down in price I must have it

4. I will only purchase a luxury item if it was on offer

5. If the price is less than I thought it would be I should get it

6. If I still want it after a week I should have it

7. If I have been thinking of it constantly I should have it

8. If I still want it after a month I should have it

9. If I have been good in other areas of my life (like dieting) then I should have it

10. If I have had a bad week or bad news I should buy it as a pick me up 

Keir McConomy, founder of LoveSales.com, said: 'Most women will be able to relate to this research to some degree and there is obviously some truth in the phrase ‘retail therapy’.

'When you see something you like and are still thinking about it a good while after, it’s probably a sign you should buy it.' 

The study also found that the longest amount of time the average woman has gone without buying a new item of clothing is only two and half months.

And then 40 per cent said they celebrate their abstinence with a big, spending blow-out.

Four in ten also like to treat themselves to something new if they have had a bad day at work.
