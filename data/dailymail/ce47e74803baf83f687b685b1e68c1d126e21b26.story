One of the two men wanted for sexually assaulting a woman twice in one hour on the streets of Brooklyn, New York, has been arrested and charged.

Nicholas Isaac, 17, is accused of carrying out the first attack at 5am - minutes before the victim was ambushed by another male just a few hundred feet away.

Police claim Isaac pushed the woman to the ground and threatened her with a gun before carrying out the assault.

Detained: Nicholas Isaac, 17, has been arrested and charged in connection with the first of two sexual assaults on a woman in Brooklyn, New York, within the space of one hour

He is now in custody awaiting arraignment, facing charges of sexual assault, unlawful imprisonment, criminal possession of a weapon and robbery.

The second attacker, described as a 6ft light-skinned black or Hispanic man, is still at large.

It is believed the pair were acting together as police claim the assault bear many similarities.

The woman says the first suspect sexually assaulted her while threatening her with a gun, although he never displayed one, New York Post reported.

After the attack, the woman walked just over 500ft, where she was set upon by a second man, who also pushed her to the ground and sexually assaulted her.

Investigation: Police believe that the two sexual assaults may have been coordinated by the two men

‘Both incidents bear extreme similarities, so we aren’t ruling that out (that one suspect tipped off the other),’ a police source told New York Post.

‘The similarities (between both sexual assaults) are hard to ignore.’

The assaults took place at 5am and 6am on Sunday August 31st in Brooklyn, New York.
