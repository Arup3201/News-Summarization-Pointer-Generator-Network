A tiny device could be about to revolutionise the way we clean our clothes.

Dolfi is no bigger than a bar of soap, yet it transforms any wash basin into a washing machine.

Its makers claim that the device washes clothes as well as a standard machine thanks to its ultrasonic technology.

Clean revolution: The Dolfi (pictured) is no bigger than a bar of soap, yet its makers claims transforms any sink into a mobile washing machine by using ultrasonic waves to blast water off clothes

To use it, a person drops the Dolfi into a sink full of water, dirty clothes and laundry detergent.

Powerful ultrasonic soundwaves are emitted by a transducer which travel through the water, forming tiny, high pressure bubbles which implode to create strong jets of water that remove dirt.

The device washes the clothes without any need for scrubbing or wringing  in just 30 minutes.

Dolfi is so small it can be carried around in a bag for use at home, hotels, or even at work.

And its creators claim that unlike a washing machine, which can damage clothes, the ultrasound leaves fabrics completely in tact so they can be washed over and over without deteriorating.

Handy on holiday: Dolfi is so small it can be carried around in a bag for use at home, hotels, or even at work. And, unlike a washing machine, which can damage clothes, the ultrasound leaves fabrics completely in tact

The device can be used on any fabric - including cotton, silk, lace and even cashmere - and uses 80 times less energy than a standard washing machine.

The machine is the brainchild of German entrepreneur Lena Solis, who was inspired to design it after encountering problem washing clothes while travelling.

'The idea of Dolfi came after a few terrible experiences with laundry during my extensive travel.

'Inspired by amazing benefits of ultrasound, successfully utilised for years in many industrial and medical applications, we're excited to bring the advantages of ultrasonic precise cleaning to everyday personal use.

Andre Fangueiro, Dolfi's product designer, added: 'We want people to have more fun on their travels rather than stress about costly laundry

Halve the housework: The Twin Wash System (pictured) was announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas

LG recently unveiled a washing machine with two washers to save time and energy by cleaning double the amount of clothes simultaneously.

Plus, homeowners can control the temperature and length of cycles, and set them to start, while they're out of the house using an app. 

The Twin Wash System was announced during LG's press conference at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. 

It is powered by the mini washer, which LG calls the 'world's first compact washer in a hide-away pedestal, generating a whole new set of washing options.'

For example, muddy gym wear can be separated from whites, or silk underwear can be washed at the same time as towels on a hot wash.

When not in use, the mini washer acts simply as the pedestal for the main washer, but it can also be combined with any of LG's front loading washers. 

The system is Wi-Fi and NFC enabled and is fitted with LG's SmartThinQ technology. 

This means users can program cycles using an app, including the temperature and length, while they're at work, or on their way home.

'I believe that ultrasonic technology will change the way we wash.'

Andre Fangueiro, Dolfi's product designer, added: 'We want people to have more fun on their travels rather than stress about costly laundryservice, or spend time searching for coin laundries, or even waste luggage space packing extra clean clothing.

'With Dolfi, travel will become easier, happier and a lot more fun.'

The makers of Dolfi will launch their bid for funding to manufacture the product on Indiegogo on January 20.

A donation of $89 - around £60 - will buy the product once it has been manufactured.
