The co-founder of the Stereosonic music festival  has vented his frustration at the violent thugs who started a mass brawl at Sydney's Showgrounds.

Frank Cotela took to his Facebook page to lay into the 'roided up' bros who took part in the vicious punch-up, which saw one man knocked unconscious amid a flurry of punches from a group of men. 

A video, which surfaced online shows about 20 well-built men throwing punches in the mosh pit of the stage.

Cotela lashed out at the 'muscle men', warning that there will be changes on the way for festival-goers who think they can ruin the day for everyone else.

He aired his frustration on Facebook about the mass brawl at Sydney's Showgrounds

'Everyone is over The Roid up Bro's muscle culture,' he said. 

'Can't they just see that they are a laughing stock… Brother EVERYONE is laughing at your Shorts, singlets, fake tans, bumbags and cartoon shaped bodies … but more importantly we are sick of the charged up violence you bring.' 

Cotela hinted that there may be changes at next year's Stereosonic festival, claiming organisers may profile each festival-goer at the gate and refuse entry if necessary. 

'If it means that we will profile you at entry point and stop you entering - you will be stopped!' he said.

The co-founder's post comes after journalism student Joel Bevilacqua wrote a scathing Facebook message to his followers, blasting the 'bruzzers' for their antics and shaming them for the world to see. 

'This 3 minute fight will be the highlight of your sad miserable life. And guess what? You're still not getting laid.., he said, referring to the three minute video posted online. 

'You bruzzers will flock in the thousands with your short shorts, cheap spray tans and expensive pingas that you were told would be 'worth it bro',' he said. 

'What I don't understand is that every year you get made fun of, and yet sure enough the next year you go and do the exact same thing. 

'So something must not be getting through to you, therefore let me make it very clear. We hate you.'

Bevilacqua continued with his damning post, in the hope that one of the fighters would stumble across it and perhaps gain a guilty conscience over the fight.  

'I hope, I really really hope that one of you 'people' in the fight sees this, and for the first time in your life you have a good long hard think,' he said.

In the disturbing video, security guards in high visibility shirts can be seen failing to stop the wild brawl, while surrounding punters barely bat an eyelid at the man who is lying unconscious, continuing to dance around him.

Richard Calugay, who watched the fight first hand, told Daily Mail Australia it started with pushing.

‘Someone pushed me in the back and the whole crowd started backing up. One of the guys king hit the guy in a blue shorts and knocked him out, and then it was on’ he said.

‘The guy was knocked out cold. I saw him get carried away by his mates, and we left the stage at that point, but I heard the fight kept on going afterwards.’

Mr Calugay said security were simply outnumbered at the event.

‘I think the security were reluctant to get involved because of the size of the guys and the amount of people around. They were outnumbered and didn’t think it was worth the risk.’ 

Mr Calugay said he believes the type and the number of festival-goers set the scene for a brawl.

‘I think Stereosonic is a very alpha-male festival. There are a lot of big guys in there, and when you mix that with a crowd of that size, you have a recipe for violence.’

The co-founder's comments come after a video appeared online showing a woman dancing naked around the festival grounds 

He said he saw other fights throughout the day that weren't filmed.

The clip has received hundreds of thousands of views since being uploaded. 

NSW police said they were disappointed with the large number of revellers found in possession of prohibited drugs at the music festival.

There were 196 people found in possession of prohibited drugs at the festival, including MDMA, cocaine, cannabis, GHB and Ketamine.

It comes just a week after the music festival displayed a number of hilarious and the most shocking videos from the festival when it hit Sydney.

One man was seen dancing and throwing his arms around before pulling his wallet out of his pocket and confusing it as an iPhone.

Another woman was filmed dancing naked in the crowds, while a number of spectators looked on.  

Stereosonic is an annual festival that takes place in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. More that 81,000 revellers attended the festival in Sydney this year.
