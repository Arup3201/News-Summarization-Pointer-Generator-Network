Leigh Anne Tuohy, the woman who was portrayed by Sandra Bullock in the 2009 film The Blind Side, has spoken of her admiration for Florida orphan Davion Only.

Only recently made an appeal at the St Marks Missionary Baptist Church for a family to adopt him which captured the nation's attention.

'No one is going to do it for you,' Tuohy told Fox News. 'You have to make it happen. Go out there and be determined to get a family.'

Tuohy and her husband Sean Tuohy adopted a teenaged Michael Oher and became the inspiration for the film The Blind Side, for which Sandra Bullock won an Oscar.

Oher came from a broken home with addict parents.

He went on to graduate college and become an NFL player, drafted by the Baltimore Ravens, who won the Superbowl last year.

'Look at our situation, Micahel has the same characteristics and we turned our car around. That random act changed his life,' said Touhy, referring to the couple's first meeting with Michael Oher, who they saw walking to school one day wearing a t-shirt and shorts in freezing cold weather.

Only told parishioners, 'I'll take anyone. Old or young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care. And I would be really appreciative. The best I could be.'

He added: 'I just want people to love me for who I am and to grab me and keep me in their house and love me no matter what.'

Tuohy said she was shocked that no one in the congregation came forward to adopt the 15-year-old on the spot.

But since news of his heartfelt plea broke, Only's adoption agency has been inundated with family's hoping to adopt him.

Sadly, Only's story of lifetime in foster care is far from unique in the U.S. There are currently 399,548 children in the system across America, many being cared for by devoted, temporary parents, and yet lacking in a definite place they can call home.

There are many older teenagers like Davion Only but fewer than 10 per cent of children adopted from foster care are between 14 and 17.

Tuohy pointed out that while Davion will be adopted, thousands more children still need families.

'Only is someone who was determined and he will have a happy ending,' Tuohy told Fox News.

'There are so many children that won't be as lucky.'
