Torino striker Ciro Immobile is on the verge of completing a move to Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund according to reports in Italy.

Gazzetta Dello Sport claim that the Italian international will put pen to paper on Saturday after a Â£15.5million deal was agreed.

The 24-year-old will reportedly sign a five-year deal with Jurgen Klopp's side as he has a day away from Cesare Prandelli's World Cup training camp in Florence.

Immobile needed a year of transition to Serie A before he could blossom into one of Italy's most lethal strikers.

Following a debut campaign in Italy's 
top flight in which he scored just five goals in 33 league appearances 
for Genoa and, after hearing criticism that he was not ready for the big
 time, Immobile proved week-in and week-out last season at Torino that 
he does have what it takes.

The
 24-year-old finished as the 'capocannoniere', the top scorer in Serie A
 with 22 goals in 33 league appearances and his performances helped 
Torino finish seventh in the league.

He also made his senior debut with Italy in an international friendly against World champions Spain in March.

'Last season he struggled but Ciro has character,' Italy coach Cesare Prandelli said. 'He has a striker's DNA and he has not been affected by negative experiences.

'Many said he wasn't ready for Serie A but now those critics praise him. He is doing very well.'

The journey has not been easy. Immobile joined Juventus in 2009 but had loan spells at Siena, Grossetto and Pescara. It was at the latter where his career began to take off.

He scored a Serie B record 28 goals to help Pescara finish top in the 2011-12 campaign and gain promotion before he joined Genoa.

'I will always remain a fan of Pescara,' Immobile said. 'My time there was crucial to grow and improve as a player. It was my launchpad to top football.'

Immobile's hopes of playing for Juve, the club that had signed him at the age of 18 for 80,000 euros, were dashed when the Italian giants sold part of his rights to cross-town rivals Torino last summer.

'Despite my (Juve) past, I was welcomed in the Torino camp with a lot of enthusiasm, something I didn't expect would happen,' Immobile said. 'I was very touched.

'(Torino coach Giampiero) Ventura is similar to (Pescara coach Zdenek) Zeman.

'From a tactical and character standpoint, they have both made me grow as a person and as a player.

'I will never stop thanking Ventura because this has been a great step for me.'

Immobile forged a potent attacking partnership with Alessio Cerci at Torino, with his team-mate notching 13 goals and setting up 11 others in Serie A.

Prandelli spoke during the season of Cerci's unselfishness and it was no surprise when he, too, made Italy's squad.

'I'm really happy that the national team coach has considered Cerci and I for the squad,' Immobile said. 'On the pitch we understand each other very well.'

The year has been so good for Immobile that the Neapolitan has surpassed Torino greats Paolo Pulici and Francesco Graziani with a single season record of goals. Toro's all-time scorer Pulici and Graziani had each scored 21 goals.

'To have overtaken two legends like Pulici and Graziani gives me great pride,' he said. 'I think I am very similar to them in character and also in my mindset to always play my best.

'I have worked so hard to reach this level but I never expected to have such a season and to lead the goalscoring charts.

'Even though we just missed out on qualifying for European football next season, our aim this season was for our fans to enjoy watching us play again and I think we have succeeded in doing so.'

'It will be difficult to turn down an important offer from abroad. But in the future I would love to play for Napoli, my home club.'
