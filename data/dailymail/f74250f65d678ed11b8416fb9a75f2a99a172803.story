I was delighted to see Lewis Hamilton win the World Championship. Without a doubt he has been the fastest man in the fastest car — and he deserved his victory.

There is almost no limit to what Lewis can achieve now. It just depends on how hungry he remains.

My old team-mate Juan Manuel Fangio did not retire until he was 47, and that was when races had to last more than three hours — twice as long as now. I do not think for a minute that Lewis will compete until he is 47 — drivers drop out in their 30s these days. But he could race for 10 more years and win seven or eight world titles — beating Michael Schumacher’s record in The process — if he has the right equipment.

So how good is Lewis? I cannot rank him alongside Fangio — a quietly spoken gentleman and, in my opinion, the finest driver ever.

It is hard to compare people nowadays to my era. I would compete in Formula One, Formula Two, sports cars, touring cars, all sorts in any given year. It was my hobby. Lewis only races 19 times a year. It is not to say he could not race in other series if he wanted to; it is just that’s not what drivers do now.

Times change. For example, when Lewis wins a race he has to go to chat up the Vodafone sponsors. When I won a race I went to chat up a damn good-looking bit of crumpet. I would not have dreamed of wearing a pair of jeans, but that is what people want to wear now. We cannot go back.

In Hamilton’s era, I would say Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso are two great drivers. They are both fast. I would say Vettel might win in the same car because of his maturity and experience —and he is an immensely fast driver. You don’t get four championships by sitting on the side.

But Lewis is right up there, and on the top of his form with the fastest car and a superb Mercedes engine. What has impressed me about his driving from his earlier years is how late he brakes. That is the mark of a top-class driver. His car control is second to none. He is pretty flawless, in fact.

Nor have I seen him do anything really untoward in the car. Schumacher was not always sporting, but with Lewis I never feel he is going to push anyone off. He’s a really first-class sportsman.

I am also pleased he has won the championship with Mercedes-Benz — the greatest team I ever raced for. They still make terrific cars. They also let their drivers race without instructions. Every race is open. It is a tradition they have stuck to this season.

My only regret is that the final race was not a real fight. With his car problem, Nico Rosberg could not really compete with Lewis. But the outcome of the championship would have been the same anyway. I think Nico has ended up in the right place — just behind the leader.

In that sense I feel Rosberg is to Lewis what I was to Fangio: a team-mate to the best driver in the world, without quite being good enough to pass him. Nico has done everything he could and he has behaved very graciously, especially in defeat.

I just do not think Nico quite has Lewis’s raw speed. So, to our new British champion I say: ‘Well done, old boy.’
