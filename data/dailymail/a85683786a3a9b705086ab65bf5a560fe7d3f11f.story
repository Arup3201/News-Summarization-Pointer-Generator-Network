The Polish monster who tortured and killed his four-year-old stepson had been jailed in this country three times, it emerged last night.

Mariusz Krezolek had also been arrested at least six times for offences including assault and burglary. But despite his serial offending, he was never put on a plane back to Poland.

Instead, together with Magdelena Luczak, he carried out a campaign of cruelty against Daniel Pelka, starving him of food, force-feeding him salt and holding him underwater. Their brutality culminated in his death in March 2012 from a head injury, locked in a cold room on a soiled mattress.

Last night an MP demanded to know why Krezolek was able to stay despite his criminal record and called for a full inquiry into whether opportunities were missed to deport him.

Geoffrey Robinson said: ‘My primary concern is for the functioning of the protective services in Coventry, including social workers and teachers. But I am also concerned as to whether the police may have missed opportunities to deport this man, who was capable of inflicting a sadistic punishment on child- and was able to stay here despite a criminal record.’

As fury mounted over the case:

Tragic: Daniel died in March 2012 from a head injury, locked in a cold room on a soiled mattress

Guilty: Daniel's mother Magdalena Luczak (right), 27, and stepfather Mariusz Krezolek (left), 34, were found guilty of his murder

Krezolek was first arrested months after he arrived in the UK in 2005. In February the following year he was convicted of drink-driving and given a 16-month driving ban. The following month he was fined £50 after he was caught stealing from a shop.

In April that year he was arrested again for driving while disqualified and in May handed a 16-week suspended jail sentence.

Three months later, in August 2006, he was arrested again for driving while disqualified and this time was locked up by magistrates who handed him an 18-week sentence.

In September 2007 he was again arrested for driving while disqualified and sentenced to 16 weeks in jail. He was handed a further 20-week term in February 2008.

Injury: Police were alerted 14 months before Daniel (right) died when he was found with a broken left arm. No action was taken after his mother (left) convinced the authorities he had fallen off a sofa

He was also arrested in August 2010 for assault and in April 2011 for burglary but on neither occasion was he charged.

Police were also alerted 14 months before Daniel died on January 5, 2011 when he was found with a broken left arm.

No action was taken after his mother 
convinced the authorities that he had been hurt falling off a sofa. It 
has also emerged that in the year leading up to Daniel’s murder, police 
visited his home at least three times over rows between the couple.

'How can the staff at the school 
attended by Daniel have failed to have recognised patterns of behaviour 
that should have set alarm bells ringing, not only within the school but
within the corridors of power within the Council House?'

- MP Geoffrey Robinson

During the entire period, Krezolek was wanted by Polish police for breaching the terms of a drink-drive sentence. If anyone had contacted the authorities there, he could have been extradited to stand trial.

Instead he was free to inflict terrible damage on his stepson. The post-mortem examination revealed Daniel’s body had 23 injuries in addition to the head wound.

By the time he died, he was a ‘bag of bones’ with the same weight as a normal toddler. Teachers had caught him stealing food from bins but believed the mother when she told them he had a genetic disorder.

They also made no record when he turned up to school with bruises on his neck and  black eyes.

Daniel was left to die for 33 hours after suffering the head injury on March 1 last year. Mr Robinson said Daniel was ‘badly let down’ by ‘an evil stepfather and an indifferent and selfish mother’ but also by his school, health professionals and social services.

He called for the resignation of children’s services director Colin Green, saying: ‘He takes with him the indelible stain of Daniel’s cruel death, which his department had failed to prevent.’ He added: ‘How can the staff at the school attended by Daniel have failed to have recognised patterns of behaviour that should have set alarm bells ringing, not only within the school but within the corridors of power within the Council House?

‘How could anyone believe it to be normal for a child to climb on the top of furniture to get to food; to scavenge around bins to access waste; and to steal food from the lunch-boxes? What human being, with the slightest understanding of children, would not have been concerned enough to take action to set alarm bells ringing?

Last night police defended their actions and sought to put the blame on the Polish police for failing to issue a European Arrest Warrant.

A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: ‘Following Krezolek’s arrests for drink driving in the UK, checks were made against the Police National Computer to establish if he was wanted in connection with other offences either in the UK or internationally. A European Arrest Warrant had not been raised by Polish authorities and so it was not known by arresting officers here that he was sought for traffic offences elsewhere.’
