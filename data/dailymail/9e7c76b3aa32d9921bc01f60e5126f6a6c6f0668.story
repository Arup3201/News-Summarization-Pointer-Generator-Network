George Black attended the Temple Hill Surgery in Dartford, Kent, three times complaining of chest pain but was each time turned away

A father who repeatedly went to his GP with chest pains could have been saved if a doctor had read his tests properly, an inquest heard.

Dr Adekemi Osadiya failed to examine George Black, 49, after a practice nurse flagged up abnormalities on his ECG examination.

Mr. Black attended the Temple Hill Surgery, in Dartford, Kent, three times complaining of chest pain but was each time sent away without being properly investigated.

North Kent Coroner's Court heard he died from a heart attack just eight days after his final visit to the practice on January 9, 2012 complaining of indigestion.

Coroner Roger Hatch said the surgery's lead GP, Dr Arun Kothari, had agreed further tests should have been arranged - and at the very least it should have been arranged for Mr Black to go to the local hospital.

However 'this, for whatever reason, was not done,' said the coroner.

The inquest heard how the practice nurse at the surgery carried out an ECG examination on Mr Black. Dr Osadiya admitted this showed an abnormality to Mr. Black's heart.

His records also showed that both his parents and his two brothers had suffered heart problems.

The coroner told Dr Osadiya: 'You knew of the complaints of chest pains, and that he had complained about it before.

'We also know there was an abnormality found by you in the ECG.'

Dr Osadiya replied: 'I am sorry, but he came in for a medical. Looking through the medical records I do not have any record he had had chest pains before.'

Mr Hatch asked: 'Didn't you think you should have asked for further tests to be conducted?'

Dr Osadiya said she would have checked the results of the blood tests carried out that day but didn't because she only worked at the surgery for three weeks.

Mr Black's family later said staff at the surgery should be 'hung out to dry' over his death

She added she hadn't spoken to the patient about his condition, she said the practice nurse had provided a 'very good history' of what he had.

The nurse had told her Mr Black had complained of chest pain three or four times a day.

Mr Hatch replied: 'She is not a doctor. Why not take two minutes to go and ask him?'

Dr Osadiya added  that her opinion was that  the chest pain was caused by a lung disease identified at the post mortem as possibly mesothelioma (cancer of the lining of the lung due to asbestos exposure).

The coroner said: 'I am recording a verdict of misadventure as the result of the failure to further investigate the ECG, given the family history and the chest pains about which he complained in November, on December 19 and on January 9.'

Mr. Black's family later said staff at the surgery should be 'hung out to dry'.

His daughter Kelly-Ann Black, 31, from Dartford, Kent, said: 'My dad is lying is his grave because they didn't check properly. Someone should deal with that. They should be hung out to dry.'

The family is now considering making a formal complaint to the General Medical Council and they are also taking legal advice.

But after the inquest Dr Osadiya said that with the benefit of hindsight she would have done exactly the same again.

She said: 'There was no evidence of heart disease apart from tension which could be due to slightly enlarged heart.'

'I would still have done the same thing going by his history.'
