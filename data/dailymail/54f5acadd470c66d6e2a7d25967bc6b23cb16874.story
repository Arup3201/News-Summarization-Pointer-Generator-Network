A reformed burglar has been hailed a hero after saving the life of an elderly woman while on his window cleaning round.

Jeff Rochford, who has 80 convictions on a criminal record that began at the age of eight, spotted June Hoyle, 78, through the window of her Stockton-on-Tees home as he set to work on her house.

Seeing she looked unwell and that her face had dropped slightly on one side, the father-of-three realised she was showing symptoms of a stroke and dialled 999 on his mobile phone.

Reformed burglar Jeff Rochford is being hailed a hero after he called emergency services after noticing June Hoyle was suffering from a stroke

His quick-thinking may have saved Mrs Hoyle's life as doctors later confirmed she had been having a stroke.

Mr Rochford said of the incident on Monday: 'I'm really glad that she's doing well in hospital and getting the care she needs.

Mr Rochford is now studying to be a mentor and hopes to help other criminals turn their lives around

'She wasn't her usual lively self and then I saw her face had dropped a bit I was concerned so I called for an ambulance. I waited until they arrived and then her son came round that night to tell me she had had a stroke and thank me.'

The 36-year-old is determined to put his criminal past behind him.

Mr Rochford said: 'I don't make any secret about my past, I was a prolific offender and I have been in prison. But that's my past now and I will never go back to it.

'It was an awful life to lead, my life was totally chaotic and at times it seemed as though there was no way out of it for me.'

And he wants to help other do the same, and has passed level one and two of a diploma in peer mentoring.

'I want to get into offender management and work with offenders to help them turn their lives around.'

Mrs Hoyle remains in hospital having treatment but is said to be 'doing well'.

Her son Dennis said: 'He saved my mum's life. I don't care about his past, what he did was fantastic and the whole family is grateful to him.

'Everyone knows the longer you leave a stroke the worse it gets. Jeff's actions made sure mum got to hospital quickly. God knows how long it would have been if he had not been there.'
