Supporters and opponents of gay marriage clashed yesterday as lawmakers prepared to vote on making New York the biggest state to legalize same-sex marriage.

The measure to make gay marriage legal, introduced by Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat and strong advocate, needs just one more vote before it can pass into the state Senate.

The state Assembly approved the bill by a wide margin last week, and Monday is the last day of the legislative session before summer recess.

Thirty-one senators, including two Republicans, are currently in favor of the bill. Its backers need one more member to back it for it to pass.

New York's Archbishop, Timothy Dolan, reiterated his and the Catholic Church's opposition to gay marriage on Sunday, vowing to oppose 'any radical bill to redefine the very essence of marriage.'

'One has to wonder why the proponents of this radical redefinition, who claim overwhelming popular support, would not consider (a referendum) on such a drastic departure from traditional values?' he wrote on his blog.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo has become a prominent champion of legalized gay marriage, pushing his state into the centre of the national debate over an emotional and divisive issue.

In the past week, the Democrat has personally lobbied wavering Republican lawmakers and has said the extension of marriage rights to gays and lesbians is 'a matter of principle, not politics.'

'This state has a proud tradition and a proud legacy as the progressive capital of the nation,' he said last Friday. 'We led the way, and it's time for New York to lead the way once again.'

The effort carries some political peril but could be potentially rewarding, given evolving public sentiment on gay rights in New York and the nation.

'It looks like a profile in courage, and maybe it is,' said Larry Sabato, director of the Centre for Politics at the University of Virginia. 'But it also may be politically smart in the long run.'

Mr Cuomo's support for gay rights is already known to voters in New York, which would become the sixth state to legalise the issue . His efforts this past week to get the bill through the Republican-controlled state Senate - the lone roadblock to passage - make good on an issue he ran on last year. During that campaign, he took his daughters to a gay pride parade in New York City, drawing sharp criticism from his Republican opponent.

'The governor is putting skin in the game and has a steadfast commitment to the issue,' said Kevin Nix of the Human Rights Campaign, a leading gay rights group. 'That he's made marriage equality a priority for this legislative session speaks volumes about his commitment.'

As a purely political matter, advocating
for gay marriage makes sense for Democrats in a state like New York, 
where gay groups are players in party politics. Mr Cuomo's lobbying, coming
after he pushed through a fiscally conservative budget, also could 
burnish his image among liberals.

Mr Cuomo is an astute politician who was a key player in his father's campaigns for New York governor three decades ago, then was schooled in President Bill Clinton's Cabinet, where he served as Department of Housing and Urban Development secretary.

The lessons learned from both are at play during this debate - the lofty, inclusive idealism of his father matched by Clinton's practical politics.

He is opposed, though, by some conservative groups and religious leaders. Archbishop  Dolan likened the effort to 'redefine' marriage to something that would be done in China or North Korea.

The U.S. federal government does not recognize same-sex marriage, but five individual states do:

Connecticut

Iowa

Massachusetts

New Hampshire

Vermont

(Plus Washington, D.C. and the Coquille Indian Tribe in Oregon)

States that recognize same-sex marriage but do not grant same-sex marriage licenses:

New York

Rhode Island

Maryland

Same-sex marriages were legal in California from June 16, 2008 to November 4, 2008, when Proposition 8 passed to prohibit the practice. As of March 2011, 41 states prohibit same-sex marriage via laws or state constitution

A Gallup poll last month found national support for same-sex marriage 
going up nine points from the previous year to 53 per cent (support was 
at 27 per cent in 1996). Support is highest among young people.

Still, polls this year have shown that more than half of voters in New York support gay marriage, with backing heaviest among Democrats. Mr Cuomo's position is also in line with New York's last two governors and its two Democratic U.S. senators. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has been a high-profile advocate of gay rights issues, and Sen. Charles Schumer came out in support of gay marriage in 2009.

In fact, the reason mr Cuomo can push for gay marriage is that he holds office in a relatively liberal state. Nationwide, governors supporting same-sex marriage appear to be in the minority. Among them are Democrats Deval Patrick in neighbouring Massachusetts and Jerry Brown in California.

Mr Cuomo, less than six months in office, has not said publicly that he wants to run for national office. But his ambition, record of success and relatively young age at 53, raises the question of whether his stance on gay marriage hurt him if he aspires to be president.

Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, said the strong opposition to gay marriage around the country is proven by the 30 states with constitutional language defining marriage as between a man and a woman.

'We never lost a public vote on marriage in any state,' he said.

A Gallup poll last month found national support for same-sex marriage going up nine points from the previous year to 53 per cent (support was at 27 per cent in 1996). Support is highest among younger people, a major reason why many analysts believe the trend will continue.

Mr Sabato said that could make Mr Cuomo's issue a winner for him in the coming years, particularly since many Democratic constituencies who will choose the party's nominee favour same-sex marriage.

'The earliest he could run is 2016,' Mr Sabato said. 'And I think his gamble is that the country is evolving on this issue and moving in New York's direction.'

Mr Cuomo has actually shifted on the issue himself, at least in public.

He favoured civil unions for same-sex partners during his first, aborted run for New York governor in 2002. At that time, Vermont allowed civil unions. No states would have legal same-sex marriage until Massachusetts in 2004.

By the time he ran for attorney general in 2006, he was using the words 'gay marriage.' And he won the race easily. The New York Times had quoted Mr Cuomo as saying he had supported gay marriage in his heart during the 2002 campaign, but didn't make it an issue because the political focus then was on civil unions.
