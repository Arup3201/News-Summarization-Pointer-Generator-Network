ISIS fighters are being trained to fly three captured fighter jets at an air base in Syria, observers claimed yesterday.

The reported flights are believed to be the first time the militant group has taken to the air and raises the possibility of attacks on British, US and French targets in neighbouring Iraq.

Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said the militants were flying the planes on ‘short flight’ training at the al-Jarrah military airport east of the city of Aleppo, where the group has a major base.

Power: ISIS has been steadily building a full-equipped military - including large tanks, such as the one pictured here in Raqqa). Much of the equipment in their possession has been seized from Syrian regime forces

‘They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for (former Iraqi president) Saddam Hussein,’ Mr Abdulrahman said.

‘People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,’ he added, citing witnesses in northern Aleppo province near the base, which is 45 miles south of Turkey.

It was not clear if the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances. Witnesses near the base in northern Syria said the jets appeared to be decades old MiG21 or MiG23 models captured from the Syrian military.

Twitter accounts linked to ISIS, also known as ISIL and Islamic State, had previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria, but the aircraft had appeared unusable, according to analysts and diplomats.

The group has captured several major military airfields, including the vast Tabqa complex, close to their headquarters in the Syrian city of Raqqa and seized aircraft, helicopters and heavy weapons.

The base was reportedly one of the Syrian military’s largest facilities in the region, with several warplane squadrons, helicopters, tanks, artillery and ammunition.

Defence analysts say that it unlikely the group's MiGs could be used conventionally as the US-led coalition of Syrian forces would shoot them down.

Leader: News of ISIS' test flights comes as Al Qaeda - which has previously condemned ISIS for being too brutal - ostensibly sought to repair ties with the group led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured)

Declaration: Titled 'Statement on the Crusader Coalition', the document is Al Qaeda's strongest show of support for ISIS since leader Ayman al-Zawahiri denounced the group for the brutal tactics late last year

Islamic State militants have been almost entirely driven out of the Syrian city of Kobane after a fightback by Kurdish forces, who vowed to either defeat the terrorists or die trying.

The extremists  have abandoned all their positions in the city except two small pockets of resistance in the east, Kurdish commander Baharin Kandal said.

As recently as Monday it looked as if the fall of Kobane was imminent.

The massively outgunned Kurdish fighters had been pushed back ever closer to the city centre by ISIS militants advancing into the suburbs, leaving hundreds of mainly elderly residents facing rape and massacre.

But with the help of the most intense U.S. and Arab bombing raids of the anti-ISIS campaign so far, the Kurdish forces have been able to kill hundreds of militants over the past two days.

They have also managed to force the militants have not been killed to retreat further into the outskirts of the town.

News that ISIS have been almost entirely forced out of Kobane comes after two days of heavy air strikes by U.S. warplanes. 

Instead, they could be deployed for spectacular low-level suicide attacks on western targets in the Kurdish city or Irbil or the Iraqi capital Baghdad where the US and Britain have a major presence.

The U.S. military said yesterday it was unaware of any flight operations by the group ‘in Syria or elsewhere’.

‘We’re not aware of ISIL (IS) conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere,’ said Central Command spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder.

‘We continue to keep a close eye on ISIL activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centres of gravity, wherever they may be,’ he added.

Meanwhile Kurdish forces, backed by US-led air strikes, are said to be continuing to make gains in their fight with militants in the key northern Syrian town of Kobani.

US-led warplanes again struck militants' positions yesterday, taking advantage of new coordination with the town’s Kurdish defenders, who are identifying targets.

Kurdish commander Baharin Kandal claimed the extremists have abandoned all of their positions in the town, except for two small pockets of resistance in the east.

As recently as Monday it looked as if the fall of Kobani was imminent, with the massively outgunned Kurdish fighters pushed back ever closer to the city centre by ISIS militants advancing into the suburbs, leaving hundreds of mainly elderly residents fearing rape and massacre.

Advance: The Islamic State and its allied Sunni militants seized the Anbar city of Fallujah, parts of Ramadi and large rural areas of Anbar early this year

Checkpoint: Earlier today, Iraqi officials in the western Anbar province said a curfew has been imposed in the provincial capital Ramadi (pictured) over fears that the Islamic State group might try to advance on the city

Activists say more than 600 people have been killed since the jihadist group launched its assault on the mainly Kurdish town a month ago.

Capturing the town would give the jihadists unbroken control of a massive stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border.

Despite their gains, Kurdish leaders say Kobani cannot survive long-term without arms and ammunition reaching the defenders.

Claims of Kurdish successes in Kobani came as the new UN human rights commissioner, Zeid Ra’ad al Hussein, described ISIS as the antithesis of human rights and ‘a diabolical, potentially genocidal movement’.

‘The way it has spread its tentacles into other countries, employing social media and the internet to brainwash and recruit people from across the globe, reveals it to be the product of a perverse and lethal marriage of a new form of nihilism with the digital age,’ he added.

Six senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a symbol of the terrorists' expanding influence among Islamist groups.

Withdrawing their loyalty to the Afghan Taliban's leader Mohammad Omar, the men - made up of the group's chief spokesman Shahidullah Shahid and five regional commanders - said they will remain members of the Pakistani Taliban, but added they now consider themselves affiliates of ISIS.

The move is likely to have serious consequences for security in Pakistan, particularly near the Afghan border where all six of the men are based, leaving it open to the kind of violence and brutal oppression ISIS has employed in the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq under the group's control.

The official announcement of the six men's declaration of allegiance to ISIS came in the form of an audio recording that emerged on Wednesday. However rumours had been circulating for weeks that several senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban were set to declare their loyalty to al-Baghdadi.

'I show allegiance to the commander of faithful, Caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Qureshi al Hussaini, and will listen and obey every order of you and will follow your orders regardless of what circumstances may be,'  Shahid said in the recording. 

There is now concern that other senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban may defect to ISIS, including the group's overall leader Maulana Fazlullah, who has previously voiced support for the terror group.

Despite several members having declared their ISIS sympathies, the announcement is the first time any senior figure within the Pakistani Taliban has actually sworn allegiance to al-Baghdadi.
