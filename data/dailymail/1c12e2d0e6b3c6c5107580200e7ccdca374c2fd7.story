Hospital records have been sold to dozens of companies including pharmaceutical giants and private firms without patients' knowledge or consent, newly-released data shows.

Details about NHS patients have gone to major names including Bayer, Baxter, AstraZeneca, Bupa and Roche.

Consultancy firms McKinsey, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and Ernst and Young are also among those who have paid to secure data from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC).

NHS bosses have sold hospital records to dozens of companies including pharmaceutical giants and private firms without patients' knowledge or consent

Some have used the apparently anonymous data to formulate marketing strategies, inform their sales teams and work with clients to get new drugs into the NHS.

Campaigners said patients would be shocked to learn how their records have been sold without their consent to boost the profits of private firms - rather than simply being used to improve NHS care.

The HSCIC said it only charges for the cost of producing the material and does not make a profit.

The release of the information by HSCIC, the new body in charge of NHS patient data, covers contracts agreed with companies from April to December last year.

It comes after revelations earlier this year that records going back 13 years were sold to the insurance industry, providing guidance to companies about how to set their prices for cover.

Controversial plans to harvest GP records for similar information have been put on hold amid concerns about patient confidentiality, including security from hackers.

But the furore over the Care.data project focused attention on the routine use being made of NHS hospital records by the commercial sector.

Roger Goss, of campaign group Patient Concern, said: 'The core purpose of NHS information, usually unstated, is that the information will be used in order for staff to take care of you. That's how 99.99 per cent of patients see it, rather than a way of making money for private companies.

'This came as a deep shock to many patients because some fear that information about their mental or sexual health or anything else they want to keep secret might fall into the wrong hands.'

The HSCIC, which pledged to release recent information about hospital data in a bid to improve transparency, says further information going back to 2005 under the supervision of its predecessor will be issued next month.

It says universities and charities were among those using statistics it supplied, including Edinburgh University which looked at whether there were changes in the numbers of children admitted to hospital with respiratory infections after the introduction of the smoking ban on July 1 2007.

The HSCIC insisted patients could not be identified from such data because it was 'pseudonymised' - stripped of significant letters or numbers that might give clues about individuals.

However, Bupa accessed anonymised data that was classed as 'sensitive' to assist them in 'benchmarking performance against national trends'.

Roche bought data to look at referrals between GPs and hospitals so it could analyse patient numbers and episodes of care at both an NHS trust and hospital level.

The private firm Health IQ Ltd, which works with the NHS and pharmaceutical companies, also accessed data.

On its website it said it had helped a client during the pre-launch of a drug in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to raise the 'priority of IBS on the commissioning agenda'.

McKinsey used pseudonymised but 'sensitive' data 'as part of our consulting services for clients'.

In total, 104 health and social care organisations (such as NHS trusts) and bodies such as universities and charities were included, alongside 56 private firms.

Phil Booth, of the campaign group medConfidential, said HSCIC was 'deliberately concealing' releases of data that might cause itself, or ministers or other officials, embarrassment or political damage. It knew of such data because it had attempted to get hold of it.

He said it was a 'ridiculous assertion' that pseudonymised data was not sensitive or identifiable.

Commercial customers had made clear it was possible to track individuals visit by visit through hospital - and with information in press reports, social media posts or the date your child was born - so their entire record could be read, he said.

'Billions of patient records continue to be sold for commercial use without patients' knowledge or consent, using as justification the very law that minsters have said provides additional safeguards.

How long does HSCIC think it can get away with ignoring Jeremy Hunt's promise to stamp out the commercial exploitation of NHS patients' information?' he added.
