Teacher Kim Davies, pictured, vowed that she would have no problems in being a whistleblower again despite being reprimanded by a watchdog 

A teacher who complained about an unruly pupil and went on sick leave was spied upon by the local education authority while she was on sick leave. 

Kim Davies, who has taught English for the past 28 years, faced the prospect of being hit with a classroom ban following allegations of misconduct.

A General Teaching Council For Wales (GTCW) hearing in Cardiff was told Mrs Davies became a thorn in the side of education officials after lodging more than 20 complaints about a colleague and nine to an exam board.

The 56-year-old was later followed by a team of private investigators after her dispute with bosses saw her signed off by a doctor on grounds of stress.

Caerphilly County Council took the drastic action after suspecting the mother-of-two was defrauding the sickness absence system - but the Information Commissioner's Office later ruled the local authority was wrong to begin the surveillance. 

However, she was still hauled before the GTCW - who found she had broken confidentiality rules about her disciplinary procedure as well as making 'vexatious' complaints.

Among the penalties available to the body included striking Mrs Davies' name from the teaching register - a move she said would have not only cost her job but also her home.

A panel decided against the more severe sanctions - and said she can carry on teaching provided she promises not to cause problems again.

Mrs Davies denied being a troublemaker and said she was 'fighting injustice' after her complaint about a pupil's behaviour was not taken seriously.

She said: 'I am relieved that I am able to carry on teaching. I don't know what I would have done if that was taken from me - it would have had a massive effect on my welfare and happiness as well as my financial circumstances.

'I've been through four years of hell - not only has there been the prospect of losing my home but also my job.

'But despite everything that I have been through it would not put me off on blowing the whistle again.

'This issue unravelled following a complaint about the safety of pupils and staff. It is the job of a teacher to ensure pupils are safe in the classroom.

'I care too much about my pupils and their welfare.

'Even though they decided the allegations against were proven, I always believed what I was doing was right.

'And if you can live with your conscience, then you can survive.'

The GTCW heard that Mrs Shaw, from Blackwood, south Wales, became embroiled in a row with bosses at Pontllanfraith Comprehensive School after lodging a complaint about a problem pupil's 'threatening behaviour'.

After feeling the issue was not taken seriously, she was subject to disciplinary proceedings in 2010 before finally being dismissed two years later.

During her period of suspension, it was found she breached confidentiality rules during the school's internal disciplinary processes and made 'vexatious allegations' to exam board WJEC in an attempt to bring the school into disrepute.

Case presenter Lousha Reynolds said the registrant also behaved inappropriately towards her line manager, her head of department and headteacher Robert Davies - whom she called 'an idiot' and referred to him being in his 'ivory tower'.

Ms Reynolds added: 'She felt her behaviour was justified because she wanted to make people pay, because she felt a sense of injustice.

'We heard today that she didn't want the education of pupils to be jeopardised, but there is still no insight into her failings.

'She was only suspended because of the way she acted towards her disciplinary proceeding.'

Ms Davies had raised issues at Pontllanfraith Comprehensive School, pictured, about a 'problem pupil' 

However, while the row rumbled on it emerged that Caerphilly Council paid private investigators £3,600 to tail Mrs Shaw for three days - a move the Information Commissioner's Office later called 'unlawful'.

In mitigation, Mrs Shaw told the GTCW she had been absolutely devastated by the events of the past four years.

'I had built up a reputation over 28 years in one school and to have that questioned and to be accused of malpractice decimated everything I believed I stood for,' she said.

NASUWT representative Colin Adkins told the hearing Mrs Shaw believed she was being disciplined after raising 'a serious safeguarding matter'.

He said: 'Mrs Shaw believed that was done by challenging her professional integrity, which she found personally devastating.

'She has suffered a serious detriment already - financially and personally - for pursuing matters she believed she was right to pursue.

'I believe the public interest is best served by allowing Mrs Shaw to continue teaching. Quite clearly, she's a good teacher.'

Panel chairman Steve Powell said the GTCW was satisfied Mrs Shaw failed to 'behave professionally' during her disciplinary process and her actions 'fell short of what is expected of a registered teacher'.

Mrs Shaw, who has been a supply teacher for the past two years, was handed a conditional registration order.

It means she can carry on teaching provided she fulfils certain requirements, such as any employer having to submit a report on her progress.

Following the decision, she said: 'I'm still trying to take in the implications of what this means but for now I just want to get back doing what I do best - teaching.'
