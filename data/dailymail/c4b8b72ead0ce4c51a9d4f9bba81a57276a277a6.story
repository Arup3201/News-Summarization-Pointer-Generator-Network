Lurking deep in a dark crevice of an old museum, this nightmarish creature has been biding its time, hiding among other strange reptiles, bones and killer sea creatures.

The ghoulish 100-year-old fruit bat is just one of thousands of unusual specimens to be shown to the public for the first time at The Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia.

To celebrate its bicentenary this year, curators at the nation’s oldest natural history museum are bringing the public into the labyrinthine museum’s normally off-limits nooks and crannies for daily tours.

Strange specimen: The fruit bat is just one of the hundreds of weird and wonderful creatures in the museum's collection

Visitors will be able to see a preserved Indian python, trays of perfectly-kept hummingbirds a horrifying Hellbender salamander.

They may even spot a polar bear skeleton, an extinct Caribbean Monk Seal - or boxes of beautiful shells that when alive can kill a human. 

‘This is a rare opportunity to get a firsthand look at some of the most stunning, and sometimes bizarre, creatures you've ever seen,’ said Academy President and Chief Executive Officer George Gephart Jr.

‘We can't wait to open our doors and show off nature's, and the Academy's, wondrous bounty.’

The museum’s collection contains some 18 million specimens representing all manner of animal, vegetable and mineral.

Its many historic collections even include Thomas Jefferson's fossils.

The Academy will 
highlight a different part of its collection each month starting with 
minerals in April and ending with fossils in February 2013.

Other months
will focus on birds, fish, insects, mollusks, amphibians and reptiles, 
plants and mammals.

An 
accompanying exhibition, ‘The Academy at 200: The Nature of Discovery,’ 
puts dozens of the academy's show-stopping treasures on public display –
many for the first time – and highlights research that museum 
scientists are conducting worldwide on hot topics of climate change, 
biodiversity, water quality and invasive species.

The tours, exhibit and other events in the coming year aim to shift some focus from the museum's storied past to its present and future.

As in the natural world, the axiom 
‘adapt or die’ applies to the Academy, which like many museums has 
struggled in the past decade with a shrinking endowment and greater 
competition for philanthropic dollars.

While founded in 1812, the museum continues to stay relevant with scientists conducting groundbreaking research into avian flu in Vietnam, testing streams in Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale gas drilling region and examining oysters for environmental fallout of the Gulf oil spill.

Others are developing pain medicine from cone snail toxin and examining whether biofuels can be developed from the wood-digesting enzymes of ship worms.

As species continue to become extinct, the images and specimens preserved in the Academy's collections will become even more crucial, said Doug Wechsler, head of the museum's Visual Resources for Ornithology (VIREO), the world's most comprehensive collection of bird photographs with 150,000 images and growing.

‘There's enough here to keep us busy for a very long time,’ said malacology collections manager Paul Callomon.

Fossils and shells: Thousands of specimens from beneath the waves are displayed for the museum's 225,000 thousand visitors each year
