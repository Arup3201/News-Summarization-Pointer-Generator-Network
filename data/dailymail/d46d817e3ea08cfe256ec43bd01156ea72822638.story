Monaco have ruled out signing former Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes after he failed a medical with the French club on Wednesday.

The Spain international left the Nou Camp last week, 12 years after making his debut for the Catalan giants, and had looked set for a move to Ligue 1.

But the transfer was put in doubt towards the end of last season after the 32-year-old damaged his cruciate ligament during a routine win over Celta Vigo in March.

And at a press conference on Thursday, Monaco’s vice-president Vadim Vasilyev confirmed the move is off.

‘Victor Valdes is injured and won’t join us,’ he told reporters.

Vasilyev went on to reiterate the club’s belief in the ability of current first-choice goalkeeper Danijel Subasic.

‘Danijel has all the qualities to keep his place next season. He had a very good season and the coach believes in him.’

Almost there: Victor Valdes was pictured with a Monaco supporter in the principality on Wednesday

Valdes had travelled to Monaco in a bid to prove his fitness on Wednesday, with one supporter of the principalilty club tweeting a picture with the Spaniard.

Leonardo Jardim - appointed after the sacking of Claudio Ranieri - will lead Monaco into the Champions League next season.

The former Sporting Lisbon coach abandoned plans to sign Valdes, despite the pre-contract agreement made between player and club in January.

Monaco's decision will alert a number of clubs in Europe, who will no doubt consider a move for a goalkeeper that has played at the highest level with Barcelona for nearly a decade.

The club released a statement on their website confirming that Eric Abidal and Ricardo Carvalho had agreed one-year extensions to their current deals.

Abidal and Carvalho are now tied to Monaco until June 2015.
