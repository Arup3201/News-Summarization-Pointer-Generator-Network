A San Francisco television station has been forced to make a humiliating apology after an on-air gaffe resulted in a live racist joke about the fatal Asiana plane crash.

During the midday broadcast on Friday, presenter Tori Campbell, announced that her news station, KTVU, had just learned the names of the four pilots who were on board Asiana flight 214 when it crashed at San Francisco International Airport on Saturday.

She then proceeded to read out four fake names from a teleprompter whilst keeping a straight face.

In poor taste: KTVU News read these names live on television today stating that the National Transportation Safety Board had confirmed that these were the pilots of Asiana 214

The names poked fun at the crash and have been further criticized for their racist undertones.

It is not yet clear where the names originated but the broadcaster did confirm them with the National Transportation Safety Board before airing them.

The safety board said a summer intern told KTVU the names were correct.

The video of the cringe-worthy mistake has gone viral and drawn heavy criticism on the Internet.

The first name — 'Captain Sum Ting Wong' might have been a giveaway that something was not quite right.

However,
 with the camera's rolling and in the middle of a live broadcast, Ms. 
Campbell continued to read without so much as flinching: 'Wi Tu Lo, Ho Lee Fuk, Bang Ding Ow.'

After
 an ad break, the station was quick to correct the gaffe clarifying that
 the names were clearly wrong and blaming the National Transportation 
Safety Board for the incorrect information.

In a statement the NTSB admitted a summer intern had 'erroneously' confirmed the names of the flight crew and was 'acting outside the scope of his authority' in doing so.

'The National Transportation Safety Board apologizes for inaccurate and offensive names that were mistakenly confirmed as those of the pilots of Asiana flight 214, which crashed at San Francisco International Airport on July 6,' the NTSB said in a statement.

'Earlier today, in response to an inquiry from a media outlet, a summer intern acted outside the scope of his authority when he erroneously confirmed the names of the flight crew on the aircraft,' it added.

Days earlier, KTVU news director Lee Rosenthal was crowing about how good his news operation had performed.

'Being
 first on air and on every platform in all aspects of our coverage was a
 great accomplishment, but being 100% accurate, effectively using our 
great sources and social media without putting a single piece of 
erroneous information on our air, is what we are most proud of as a 
newsroom.'

The station issued a statement on Friday afternoon acknowledging it had 'misidentified the pilots involved.'

Third victim: A San Francisco hospital says a third victim of a plane crash, a Chinese girl, has died from her injuries. She was among about a dozen injured still in hospital after Asiana flight 214 crashed as it approached the airport too low last week

In an-online apology, KTVU general 
manager Tom Raponi wrote: 'We sincerely regret the error and took 
immediate action to apologize, both in the newscast where the mistake 
occurred, as well as on our website and social media sites. Nothing is 
more important to us than having the highest level of accuracy and 
integrity, and we are reviewing our procedures to ensure this type of 
error does not happen again.'

Two
 teenage girls from China and another unidentified passenger were killed and more 
than 180 people injured when the Boeing 777 clipped a sea wall and 
slammed into a runway Saturday at San Francisco International Airport.

Based in Oakland, California, the Fox affiliate represents a city where 16.8% of the population is Asian.

KTVU
 also broadcasts in two heavily Asian-populated communities: San 
Francisco, where Asians make up 33.3% of the total population and San 
Jose, where 32% of the population is Asian.

KTVU’s
 false report comes after a week of speculating whether last week's 
disastrous Asiana Airlines crash could be attributed to Korean 'culture'
 and whether South Korea’s tradition of deference to hierarchy could 
have played a role in the crash.

Broken news: Anchor Tori Campbell read the names off the teleprompter and didn't bat an eye, adding that the information had been confirmed by the National Transportation Safety Board

Asiana Airlines has identified two of the four flying crew on board as the pilot and copilot Lee Kang-kook and Lee Jung-min.

Coverage of the tragic plane crash at San Francisco International Airport, which killed three people and injured dozens of others last Saturday has proven tricky for some news outlets.

Earlier this week, the Chicago Sun-Times apologized for its front page headline 'FRIGHT 214,' which was criticized for sounding like a stereotype of an Asian accent.
