A budget-conscious mother has won the £5.8million lottery jackpot - but she was too worried about money to call the hotline in order to claim her winnings.

Tracy Tyler was only persuaded to ring up Camelot after her partner promised to foot the bill for the phone call.

Nearly a week after their massive win, the couple have not yet spent a penny of the jackpot - apart from buying a round of drinks and taking their children to the local swimming pool.

Winners: Adam Young and Tracy Tyler have won £5.8million on the lottery after scooping Saturday's jackpot

Mother-of-two Ms Tyler, 37, has been struggling for money ever since her partner Adam Young was made redundant from his job in a warehouse two months ago.

The couple, from Epping in Essex, have learned to live on a budget, and have never been able to buy their own home.

'When he lost his job the bills were getting a bit tight. We had done OK so far but it was getting worse,' Ms Tyler said.

'We had managed to make enough phone calls and juggle things around. I was quite good at juggling after years of practice.

'Occasionally I had to ask my mum to help me though.' 

Joy: But the mother of two was initially reluctant to ring up the Camelot winners' hotline

On Saturday, she learned that her numbers matched the winning ones in the Lotto draw - but was reluctant to ring the winners' hotline to claim her £5,819,806 fortune.

'The lottery was an 0845 number and I was a bit worried that would cost me money,' Ms Tyler said.

'But he said he would pay for it so I said all right. I don't like to waste money, I'm very cautious.'

0845 numbers cost just 2p a minute to phone from a landline under BT's default calling plan.

The delighted mother toasted her win with 'a large vodka and coke', and took her children for a swim the next day.

Spending: The couple plan to buy a Range Rover and invest in owning their own home for the first time

She plans to buy a new Range Rover in place of Mr Young's battered Citroen Saxo, and will also go on his first ever trip abroad.

Mr Young, 30, who has previously spent several hours a day looking for a job, said that he was acutely aware of how much the couple's life had changed - but added that he might go back to work anyway.

'This time last week, we certainly weren't sitting by a pool in the sun,' he said from a hotel in Essex. 'I was online looking for jobs. I worked in a warehouse, I had been there for eight years.

'I spent a couple of hours every day applying for jobs, sending my CV off. A few were planning to get back to me this week, so we will see what happens.

'I could yet be offered a job so I would have to make the decision whether or not to take it, or take a sabbatical or something.'

Happy: The pair had been struggling ever since Mr Young lost his job working in a warehouse

The couple said they have yet to check whether their winnings have been paid in to the bank, but plan to spend some money on buying their own home.

They also hope to get advice from Camelot on how to deal with such a huge jackpot.

Ms Tyler, who is continuing to play the lottery, added: 'If there was one more person in front of me in the queue when I bought my ticket, it could have been completely different.

'We have been very lucky.'
