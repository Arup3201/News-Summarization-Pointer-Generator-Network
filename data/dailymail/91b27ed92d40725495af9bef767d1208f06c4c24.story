American Patrick Reed has been cast in the role of bad guy at the Volvo World Match Play Championship at the London Club, and how he is relishing it.

Up against Europe’s latest Ryder Cup darling Jamie Donaldson on Friday, he turned up for the part dressed appropriately in black trousers and black sweater. Outside the ropes, his equally extrovert wife Justine chose an outfit laden with stars and stripes.

At the eighth hole, the crowd got into the mood by ‘shushing’ Reed on to the green in a mischievous mocking of the player’s infamous gesture at Gleneagles. Reed loved it. He couldn’t keep the smile off his face.

‘I just wish I’d been able to hole the putt and have a bit of fun back with them,’ he said, smiling.

If truth be told, of course, he’s not the bad guy at all but a refreshing presence in a sport where characters are always welcome.

The British crowds have developed a soft spot for him already and, as we learned three weeks ago in Scotland, he can really play.

Reed was firmly in control of this match until the end, when Donaldson threw an eagle at him at the 15th and then knocked a wonderful tee shot close to the flag at the par-three 16th.

How would Reed respond? He calmly knocked his own tee shot to eight feet and holed the putt to close out the match.

‘TaxSlayer,’ is the logo on his sweater. By Sunday night he might have to change it to Euro-Slayer.

Reed made headlines earlier this year when he brashly forecast it wouldn’t be long before he was ranked among the world’s top five.

Donaldson fought back against the American with an eagle at the fifteenth but it was not enough 

Talk about piling the pressure on yourself, yet the following week he hung on to win the WGC-Cadillac Championship in Miami. It was his third win on the PGA Tour at the age of just 23 and now he has set his sights firmly on an overseas victory as the next step in his career.

The first thing Reed did Friday was congratulate Donaldson on claiming the winning point at the Ryder Cup. ‘I saw him at Gleneagles but only briefly amidst everything that was going on and so it was nice to get the chance to say well done properly,’ said the Texan.

‘We talked about it quite a bit, and let’s hope we are both on future Ryder Cup teams.’

Provided they win their quarter-final ties today, Reed will play Henrik Stenson in the semis tomorrow morning in a repeat of their Ryder Cup singles match. Asked about that, Reed came up with the perfect response. ‘He’ll definitely be wanting to get back at me for that but I’ll be feeling a bit that way as well,’ he said.

‘After all, I might have got the W (a win) but he got to hold the trophy.’

Before that, Reed will take on South African George Coetzee on Saturday while the impressive Stenson, who closed out his match against Thongchai Jaidee by holing his second shot to the par-four 17th, will play fellow Swede Jonas Blixt.

It is perhaps as well Stenson and Reed are still involved, for not one of the five players representing Britain and Ireland made it out of the group stages. Englishman Paul Casey was the unluckiest.

He was actually 10 under par for his 18 holes yesterday but still couldn’t beat Blixt, who matched him to force a play-off for a quarter-final spot.

Given the tremendous quality of the match, it was a shame that it had to end with a Casey blunder, as he found the water at the par five first to lose the hole to a par.

Defending champion Graeme McDowell, Shane Lowry, and Stephen Gallacher were the other casualties. The other quarter-finals on Saturday, therefore, are all-European affairs: Joost Luiten against Pablo Larrazabal while Victor Dubuisson will play Mikko Ilonen.
