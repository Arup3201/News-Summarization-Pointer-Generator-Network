Louis van Gaal prepares for the final stages of his debut season in English football buoyed by a reduction in his injury concerns and the backing of the Manchester United fans.

The no-nonsense Dutchman has seen his approach questioned, with club legend Paul Scholes describing his team's style of play as 'miserable'.

Despite those criticisms, a run of just one defeat in their last 19 games has seen United reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup and cement their claims to a top-four finish. 

A poll by the Manchester Evening News found that 81% of United fans are backing Louis van Gaal

However, former Red Devils midfielder Paul Scholes has branded Van Gaal's style of play as 'miserable'

A local newspaper poll of United supporters this week handed Van Gaal an 81 per cent approval rating, much to the delight of Van Gaal, who said: 'Over 80 per cent? Unbelievable! In spite of your criticism, that's fantastic! Thank you, I am so honest now. I can repeat it — more than 80 per cent. But this is not the first time that the fans are amazing . . . it happens every match that they are supporting in spite of being behind.'

United travel to Swansea Saturday with only Michael Carrick injured and, asked if he can now name his best line-up, Van Gaal said: 'We are very close to that stage.'

The Red Devils are currently third in the Premier League table with 47 points from 25 games.
