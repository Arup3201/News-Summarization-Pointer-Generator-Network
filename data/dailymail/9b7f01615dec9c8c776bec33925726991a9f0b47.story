Insomniac: Jason Nock, 41, had turned to the legal drug to help him sleep, the inquest heard

A father suffering from insomnia who resorted to taking a legal morphine-like drug to help him sleep died after accidentally taking an overdose, an inquest heard.

Jason Nock, 41, bought the drug online after being plagued by the condition for years, the coroner was told.

He accidentally took more than four times the fatal dose of the drug.

His partner Lea Maninang raised the alarm in the morning when he would not wake and he was rushed to hospital where he later died.

Mr Nock, who had a one-year-old daughter Jemima, had turned to the synthetic drug after years of being plagued by insomnia.

Miss Maninang told the inquest that the father, from Cradley Heath, West Midlands, ordered the drug online but insisted he was not an addict.

Breaking down in tears, she told the hearing: 'He ordered it from the internet and they delivered it.

'I just found out about him taking these drugs when I moved in with him (in 2012). Just lately before he died he said it helped with his sleeping.

'Sometimes he took it, sometimes he didn’t.'

He was taken to Russells Hall Hospital, in Dudley, West Midlands, on August 17 last year but was pronounced dead.

Dr Sixto Batitang, a consultant pathologist at the hospital, told the inquest that Mr Nock had nearly five times the fatal dose of the drug in his system.

Tests revealed he had 4.46mg per litre of blood in his system and the usual fatal dose is between 0.81 and 0.99mg.

Dr Batitang told Wednesday’s hearing that the drug was similar to morphine in its action and potency, adding: 'The possibility of toxicity from this drug is really very high.'

Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner Robin Balmain, sitting in Dudley, said he would ask the Home Office to consider banning the substance.

He said: 'This is tragic. It seems to me the problem with drugs that are not prescribed by a doctor and obtained through a pharmacist is that you don’t know what they are

Doctors frequently prescribe drugs to combat insomnia - but only in the smallest dosages.

GPs will generally only provide drugs when the problem is very severe, and even then only for short periods.

The reason is anti-insomnia drugs don't treat the cause of the problem, and a doctor may instead refer the patient to a psychologist to look at other treatments.

It is very easy to become dependent on sleeping tablets, even when they are only used in the short term.

Patients should always seek advice from a doctor or pharmacist.

'And perhaps more importantly, you don’t know how many to take and how regularly to take them before problems occur.

'I also propose to write to the Home Office about this case.

'I’m aware that obtaining drugs other than via prescription is very easy these days. It’s possible to obtain all sorts of substances via the internet.

'Even though it’s a big problem, I 
think it’s necessary that people like me draw to the attention of the 
Home Office what the problems are to see if anything can be done.

'Consideration might be given to making it illegal which it isn’t at the moment.'

The coroner ruled that the death was an accident.

Speaking from the couple’s home yesterday, Miss Maninang said: 'Jason was my world. What has happened as devastated us all.'
