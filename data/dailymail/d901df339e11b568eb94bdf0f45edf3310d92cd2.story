Wigan goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi has seen Australia goalkeeper Mat Ryan up close - and is in no doubt that he is the man to solve Liverpool's goalkeeping problems.

Al-Habsi was Ryan's opposite number as Australia beat Oman 4-0 in the Asian Cup last Tuesday but the result could have turned differently after an astonishing save from Ryan kept out a volley from Raed Salah two minutes into the game.

'He's brilliant,' Al-Habsi raved to FourFourTwo. 'He has been fantastic in the World Cup and here in the Asian Cup.'

Al-Habsi believes that Ryan is the answer to Liverpool's goalkeeping problems this season

Liverpool's first-choice stopper Simon Mignolet has appeared bereft of confidence throughout the season and his untidy footwork has hindered the passing movements that Brendan Rodgers likes to see his team build from defence.

Brad Jones replaced Mignolet in the side for what was intended to be an indefinite period before sustaining a thigh injury against Burnley during the Christmas fixtures. 

And with Rodgers enforcing a recruitment policy of young players with great potential, Al-Habsi believes 22-year-old Ryan would be a perfect signing at Anfield.

'He's young, he can only improve and, of course Liverpool is a big club and for him it would be a great chance to make it.'

But Mignolet showed signs of a resurgence in form and belief in Liverpool's 2-0 win at Aston Villa on Saturday.

He made a fantastic save to deny Christian Benteke with the score at 1-0, before demonstrating the authority that he has rarely imposed this season by coming out to punch away the type of teasing delivery into the penalty area that has had him scrambling.
