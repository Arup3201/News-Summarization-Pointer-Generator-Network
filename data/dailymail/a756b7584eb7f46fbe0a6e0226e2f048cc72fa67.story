A friend sent me a very interesting document last week. It is Liverpool’s wage bill... from August 17, 1960. You’ll recognise the names if not the sums.

Future World Cup winner Roger Hunt takes home 22 quid; Ian Callaghan £18 and 13 shillings; and Anfield legend Billy Liddell collects £16 and two shillings per week and pays the club £2 to rent a house.

Bill Shankly must have counted as an executive, because he is not listed, but Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan are already on the staff, giving some idea of the wealth and depth of experience in that famous boot room. Different times, of course.

Hunt took home £22 - a far cry from modern wages - as the Liverpool's wage bill from August 1960 shows

This was also the last year that football had a maximum wage. We often hear that money has ruined the game. It will have an effect on any industry. 

Yet players today get what they are worth in a commercial environment that generates billions.

Liverpool were a Second Division team in 1960-61, but still drew 43,041 for their first home match with Leeds United three days after these salaries were paid. 

That game ended in a 2-0 win. Makes you wonder where it all went, once the man the fans came to see took out his 20 quid.
