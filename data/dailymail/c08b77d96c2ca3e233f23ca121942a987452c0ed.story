A group of pensioners in Germany are proving that classic films really never get old, as they pose for a calendar recreating some of the most iconic scenes in the history of modern cinema.

The cheeky OAPs all live in a retirement home in Essen, Germany, and dressed up as the leading men and women from famous movies.

The images, for their annual calendar named 'Classics 2014', includes picture perfect recreations of famous moments from James Bond, Mary Poppins, Titanic, Dirty Dancing and The Blues Brothers.

January: Lothar Wischnewski, 76, and Margarethe Schmidt, 77, pose as the Blues Brothers in the first of 12 reenactments of famous movements by a German retirement home

February: Irmgard Alt, 79, dazzles in a red dress and Siegfreid Gallasch still has better hair than John Travolta despite hitting 87, as they get their Saturday Night Fever on

March: Martha Bajohr, 77, says Willkommen as Liza Minnelli's Sally from Cabaret

A total of 5,000 copies of the calendar were printed and given to retirement home staff members, residents and their families.

But since the images made their way onto the web, demand has shot up, and fans from all across the country are trying to get their hands on a copy.

The residents are aged from 75 to 98, the oldest being Walter Loeser, who pulled a suave pose on a motorcycle, as he re-enacted a scene from 1969 movie Easy Rider.

'It was really exciting to sit on one of these rides, Walter's companion on the shoot, 90-year-old Kurt Neuhaus, representing Easy Rider's Wyatt told Der Spiegel.

'Ideally, I would just set off'

April: Erna Rutt, 86 is flying in the hands of Alfred Kelbch, 81, as they portray Jack and Rose in the classic Titanic scene

May: Wilhelm Buiting, 89, is a Golden-oldie-finger as forever young spy James Bond is finally allowed to age

June: Ingeborg 'Marilyn Monroe' Giolbass, 84, impresses 88-year-old Erich Endlein in the silver-haired version of the Seven Year Itch

July: Patrick Swayze, or Johann Liedtke, 92, lifts Jennifer Grey, or Marianne Pape, 79, high, in the classic lake scene from Dirty Dancing

August: Johanna Trachenberg, 81, and Horst Krischat, 78, pose as Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean in 1956 film Giant

'I am not quite strong enough to lift a lady over my head anymore,' said John Liedtke, 92, or Patrick Swayze, who is seen holding 'Baby' Marianne Pape, 79, high in the lake scene from Dirty Dancing.

'Back when I was young, it would have been easy. Nowadays I need the computer tricks to do it,' he said.

In other months, Erwin J. von der Heiden, 80, raises his arms in triumph as Rocky, James Bond is finally allowed to age in the shape of 89-year-old Wilhelm Buiting and Ingeborg Giolbass, 84, is stunning as a silver-haired Marilyn Monroe.

And, with the help of professional hair and makeup artists, Marianne Brunsbach, 86, poses as Holly Golightly in the iconic scene for Breakfast at Tiffany's.

Heinz-Jurgen Heiske, a member of the board at Contilia, said: ‘Everyone was surprised we succeeded in making such a well-made calendar - the residents and others were delighted with the outcome.’

September: The oldest participant Walter Loeser is an impressive 98 years old, but still managed to got on his (borrowed)bike with 90-year-old Kurt Neuhause for the Easy Rider remake

October: No one would think that Erwin J Von Der Hedien, 80, was anything but a fighter as he poses as Rocky

November: The wind is in the east as Erna Schenk, 78, flies in over London as Mary Poppins

December: She may have needed the help of a wig, but 86-year-old Marianne Brunsbach is definitely how you would imagine a perfectly aged Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffanys
