The New Zealander picks up gongs for Best Pop Solo Performance and Song of the Year for her smash hit Royals

Misses out on two more as Record of the Year goes to Daft Punk for Get Lucky and Bruno Mars wins Best pop vocal album for Unorthodox Jukebox

Lorde's effortless ascension to pop royalty was cemented as she took home Best Pop Solo Performance and Song of the Year for her smash hit the Royals at the 2014 Grammy Awards on Sunday night.

Looking stunned and in awe of the whole event, the 17-year-old star took to the stage to collect her Best Pop Solo Performance award saying: 'This is the one thing I didn't expect tonight.'

But she pulled herself together to thank her fellow nominees and category losers, Bruno Mars, Justin Timberlake, Sara Bareilles and Katy Perry for being inspirational vocal artist in what was unsurprisingly a typical awkward speech from a teenager.

Overwhelmed: Lorde picks up the gong for Best Solo Pop Performance for her debut album Pure Heroine and then, later, scoops prize for Song of the Year for knockout hit Royals at the Grammys on Sunday night

Vampish beauty: Dressed in floor-length, clingy black dress fashion forward Lorde looked beautiful as she picked up her award and thanked her fellow nominees for being inspirational

It's not surprising she was self-conscious, as the self-described feminist - whose boyfriend James Lowe is 24 - achieved all of her recent fame still in her final year at Takapuna Grammar School in Auckland.

And she seemingly came out of nowhere in the past few months to take over the music world.

In face she has broken records by becoming the first New Zealand solo artist to have a number one song in the United States

Dressed in a floor-length, jet black 
frock with crimson lips, bold brows and tousled hair, the trend setting 
star looked gorgeously vampish as she took to the stage.

'This
 is the one thing that I did not expect the most about tonight,' she 
said. 'Thank you so much. I think mostly to Bruno Mars, Justin 
Timberlake, Sara Bareilles and Katy Perry. I have been so inspired by 
all of your vocal work at some point in my life so thank you and thank 
you all so much.

It was
 a similarly short and sweet yet slightly awkward speech as she 
collected her second award of the night for Song of the Year alongside 
producer Joel Little.

Woman in black: The 17-year-old said the award win was totally unexpected, saying: 'This is the one thing I didn't expect tonight'

Nerves: The teenager was understandably nervous as she accepted her first award but powered through her brief acceptance speech

Joel, revealing Lorde - whose real name is Ella Maria Lani Yelich-O'Connor - had asked him to speak first, said: 
'This is intense – we made this song originally to give away for free so
 to be here and in a room with all of these legends is an honour so 
thank you for that.

'Thanks
 to my wife and kids, I love you so much and to my manager I like you a 
lot. And Ella, I think you’re amazing I always have.'

Lorde
 thanked Joel and her fans for supporting her, saying: 'Thank you 
everyone who has let this song explode because it's been mental.'

Endearingly awkward: It was a similarly short and sweet yet slightly awkward speech as she collected her second award of the night for Song of the Year

Grateful: Lorde praised her producer Joel Little for supporting her and helping to developing her songwriting skills

What a transformation: Joel admitted they had planned to release the single Lorde for free in the hope of getting some airplay for it

After her brief speech, the overcome star left the stage.

Lorde beat Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, Katy Perry, Bruno Mars and Pink and Nate Ruess to take the gong.

The
 gothic songstress just missed out on two more awards as Record of the Year went to Daft Punk's Get Lucky featuring 
Pharrell and Nile Rodgers while Bruno Mars won Best pop vocal album for Unorthodox Jukebox.

Superstar: Lorde has gone from unknown to Grammy winner in a very short space of time

The New Zealander, who skipped the red carpet, took to the stage earlier in the night in a low-key shirt and trousers and big hair to deliver her award-winning hit Royals.

In her signature goth style the songstress wore white face make-up, bold brows, deep crimson lippy and some freaky fingers - dip-dyed black nails.

Queen of cool: Lorde performed her hit Royals at the Grammy Awards on Sunday in LA

Freaky fingers: The singer was sporting some unusual nail art with the ends of her fingers looking like they'd been dipped in tar

Goth girl: With her dramatic white face make-up, deep purple lippy and  scary dipped black nails, Lorde looked gorgeously gothic

The fashion trend setter's unusual 
nail art made it look as if she'd sunk her hands into a pot of black tar
 and lent an vampish edge to her ensemble.

She blew the crowd away with her captivating rendition of the catchy track. .

No fuss: The teen wore a simple white blouse and black trousers

Heavenly: Lorde had the audience captivated through her performance

Shining light: Despite being just 17 the star has been firmly in the spotlight this year

Film noir: With her long black hair the singer looked suitably dramatic on stage

With
 so many nominations at such a young age, Lorde recently admitted her life has changed.

She told Rolling 
Stone magazine: 'It's a really weird thing to write a song like Royals 
and then go through something like this, which changes your entire world
 and way of living and changes what you do every day.'

When speaking about today's modern music, the singer also said: 'Nothing is in one genre, nothing is easily defined.

Famous fans: Lorde was joined by Beyonce for a photograph as the duo got to know each other at the Grammys

BFFs: Lorde and Taylor Swift have become close pals since the 17-year-old singer found fame

'My
 first love is electronic music and then going to top 40 pop and hip-hop
 and weird pre-jazz records and taking from each of those and figuring 
out what was missing, what I wanted to hear in it.

'I think that's what people my age do', she said.

The
 self-described feminist had been posting outlandish fashion ideas for 
her Grammy gown on Instagram - poking fun of the red carpet hullabaloo.

Excited: Taylor was thrilled for her young pals as they caught up at the Grammy Awards on Sunday following Lorde's wins

Getting advice? Lorde looked slightly starstruck as she shared a giggle with Beyonce
