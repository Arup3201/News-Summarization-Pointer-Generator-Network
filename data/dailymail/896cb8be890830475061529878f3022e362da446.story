A head teachers’ leader will today issue an unprecedented apology for historic child abuse scandals that ‘shame’ boarding schools.

Ray McGovern will admit that revelations ‘cast a long shadow’ over today’s institutions.

He will use his keynote speech as chairman of the Boarding Schools’ Association to apologise ‘unreservedly’ on behalf of the sector for past incidents of child abuse.

He will also admit that boarding schools were a ‘closed world’ where reputation mattered more than the welfare of children.

Victorian attitudes prevailed that resulted in children being ‘seen and not heard’ and disciplined in line with the belief that ‘sparing the rod’ spoiled the child.

But Mr McGovern will say that modern schools cannot be judged on how they were in the 1950s, 60s and 70s and are now ‘unrecognisable’ from their predecessors.

His apology follows revelations that 128 leading independent schools – mainly boarding schools – have been tainted by the scandal of child abuse.

An investigation revealed in January that one or more men employed at 62 schools – including many elite boys’ public schools such as Haberdashers’ Aske’s, Wellington College and Ampleforth – have been convicted of abusing children over the past 20 years.

Eton and Marlborough are among 30 schools where a male staff member has been convicted for possession of child porn.

Another 36 schools have had their reputations tarnished by ongoing investigations, cases involving arrests but no charges, civil action for damages and staff abusing children who were not pupils.

Mr McGovern, headmaster of St George’s School, a state day and boarding school in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, will address the issue at the BSA’s annual conference in Glasgow today.

‘It shames me, and it shames the sector, that behaviour such as this happened or was allowed to happen, and for that I am unreservedly sorry,’ he will say.

‘I am sorry to those who were affected directly and to those who placed their trust in individuals who could not be trusted.’ Mr McGovern will say that schools are now much more closely regulated and that BSA members share a ‘genuinely different attitude’ towards child welfare.

‘Today’s boarding schools should not be judged by their predecessors of generations past. You wouldn’t judge a hospital now on the basis of how it was in the 1960s,’ he will announce.

In his speech, Mr McGovern will also hit out at claims that boarding school pupils are not well prepared for real life and ‘can’t boil an egg or wash their own clothes’. ‘This is not my experience. I expect it’s not yours,’ he will say.

And he will argue that universities and employers ‘increasingly look for more than top academic grades’. ‘They look for social skills and confidence, independence and resilience, character and perseverance. They look for true grit. You want all that as well outstanding exam results? No problem. That’s what we do,’ the audience will be told.
