One of the world's biggest multinational companies is trying to push for better relations between India and Pakistan with a new advertising film.

Coca-Cola installed high-tech vending machines in two popular shopping malls in Lahore and New Delhi.

Breaking boundaries: Coca Cola is attempting to ease the relationship between India and Pakistan through vending machines in which people from both countries can interact with each other

Impressive: The vending machines were set up in shopping centres in India and Pakistan and have a camera and screen user interface which provides a live communications portal linking strangers

Using the 'Small World Machines', Coca Cola provided a live communications portal linking strangers in the cities.

The firm used 3D touchscreen technology to project a streaming video feed onto the vending machine screen while simultaneously filming through the unit to capture a live emotional exchange.

The technology used was similar to Apple‘s FaceTime.

The machines prompted shoppers in New Delhi to ‘make a friend in Pakistan’ while mall goers in Lahore were asked to meet someone from India. 

Unique: This father and son take part in the interactive vending machine

Fun: Before they can claim a can of coke, people using the machine are encouraged to complete a friendly task such as wave, touch hands, draw a peace sign or dance

People from both countries who engaged with the screens were encouraged to complete a friendly task together such as wave, touch hands, draw a peace sign or dance before they shared a Coca-Cola.

The firm said it hoped to provoke happiness and promoting cultural understanding around the world.

In order to produce the film, crews working for Coca Cola filmed through the night and captured more than 100 interactions between people of all ages and from all walks of life.

Saad Pall, Coke’s assistant brand manager in Pakistan, said: 'The people of Pakistan and India share a lot of common passions and interests – from food and Bollywood movies, to Coke Studio music, to cricket.

'What this project did was connect people who are not exposed to each other on a daily basis, enabling the common man in Lahore to see and interact with the common man in Delhi. It’s a small step we hope will signal what’s possible.'
