When two famous Czech actors agreed to pose as disabled police officers and stop people for 'speeding',  it seemed like an innocent enough prank.

But the charity video went horribly wrong when one of the men they flagged down suffered a heart-attack, upon hearing it was a candid camera stunt.

The men have since claimed they intended to gauge people's reactions to being pulled over by disabled policemen, in a bid to raise awareness.

Horror: The stunt went horribly wrong when one man had a heart-attack, upon hearing it was a prank

Good intentions: Petr Ctvrtnicek told an appeal court: 'The aim was to help disabled people and we did it in good faith'

One was in a wheelchair while the other used crutches, in the video organised by charity Konto Bariery. 

Jan Potmesil, 48, and Petr Ctvrtnicek, 50, were given suspended sentences in October last year for their involvement in the prank.

A district court in the Czech capital Prague has since acquitted the actors of the crime of impersonating a police officer.

Mr Potmesil told the appeal court: 'It was not our aim [to harm someone] and I am really, very sorry about it.

'I thought that we were doing something good and we thought that everything would be all right.'

Fellow actor Petr Ctvrtnicek said: 'I agree. The aim was to help disabled people and we did it in good faith.'

The charity video, which was filmed in 2012 in Prague, was due to air on Czech national television. 

The court in Prague initially found both actors guilty of using impersonating the police because they wore uniforms and were carrying out police activities.

The charity video, which was filmed in 2012 in Prague, was due to air on Czech national television.

They replied by pointing out that the police uniforms were not real, and they thought it was obvious it was just a sketch and not a real police action.

Mr Ctvrtnicek slammed the Czech television station for failing to protect them, saying: 'I would like to advise all my colleagues to take lawyers to dressing rooms of televisions or film studios. Otherwise the same thing will happen to them.'

And Mr Potmesil followed: 'I am really sorry about it. I did not expect that people wouldn't recognise us.'

After the verdict overturning the conviction was announced, the public gallery erupted into cheers of support from fans of the pair and family.
