Thursday was a day off school for Thusha Kamaleswaran, who spent the morning watching her favourite cartoon shows on television. But at 1pm she switched channel for the lunchtime news. She knew she wasn’t supposed to, but she couldn’t help herself.

Thusha’s parents had told her not to watch, desperate to protect her from hearing anything about the gangland shooting that has left her paralysed from the chest down.

But last week was an important turning point in Thusha’s short life. Not only did she return to school  for the first time since the incident a year ago, but the three men convicted over the attack on her were sentenced at the Old Bailey.

Thusha, who has suffered from nightmares that the trio would return to ‘get my brother and sister’, wanted to know the instant a decision had been made about how much time the ‘bad men’, as she refers to them, would spend in jail.

The six-year-old, who wants to be a doctor when she grows up, concentrated hard as the newsreader announced that a judge had given them life sentences.

Thusha immediately phoned her parents, who were at the Old Bailey, and asked her mother Sharmila: ‘Does that mean they will die in jail?’ Sharmila, 35, told her that the gang would eventually be released, but not for many years.

‘When I heard they would go to prison for life, I thought it meant their whole lives,’ Thusha said.

‘My mum has explained that it doesn’t mean until they die, but I know they won’t be able to come out for a really long time.

‘She
told me that everyone involved was very happy that the men were going 
to jail. I’m also very happy that they won’t be able to hurt any more 
people. But they are nasty men and they never even said they were sorry 
for hurting me.’

Thusha’s 
life changed in an instant in March last year as she played in the 
aisles of her uncle’s convenience store in Stockwell, South London. CCTV
pictures showed her being pushed aside as two men ran into the store, 
trying to escape from three men outside. Shots were then fired into the 
shop.

Thusha, in her red 
school uniform, collapsed after a bullet hit her in the chest and 
damaged her spine. Her heart stopped twice and she had to be revived by 
paramedics before three operations at King’s College hospital in 
Camberwell, South London, saved her.

It
was three weeks before her parents were told she would never walk again
and a year before Thusha was released back into their care from the 
experts in spinal injuries at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, 
Buckinghamshire.

The three men in court were Nathaniel 
Grant, 21, Kazeem Kolawole, 19, and Anthony McCalla, 20. Grant, who 
fired the gun, will serve a minimum of 17½ years. McCalla and Kolawole 
will each spend at least 14½ years in prison.

While Thusha is relieved that the ‘bad men’ who hurt her are no longer a threat, her parents are angry that they could be back walking the streets when they are still only in their 30s.

Sharmila said: ‘I felt the sentence was lenient. Thusha is in a wheelchair, probably for the rest of her life. It is a life sentence for her, but if these guys are released they will still be relatively young and able to live active lives.

‘It’s hard for me to see my child who was once so happy now in a wheelchair. I’ve shed many tears over it. So, of course, we would like life to mean life, but we have our faith in the British justice system and it only works if we can be strong enough to accept the results.’

Thusha’s father Jeyakumar, 37, who is 
known as Sassi, said: ‘They have shown no remorse. During the sentencing
I kept looking at them, but they didn’t look at us. I suspect they 
didn’t have the guts to look us in the eyes. I’m frustrated that they 
will always be able to walk, run and move. Thusha won’t be able to.

‘We
wanted to scream at them, but if we had ranted and raved, then there 
would have been no difference between us and those brutes.’

Pitiful: He lifts her limp form from the floor 
and carries her to safety. Thusha's heart stopped twice on the way to 
hospital and paramedics feared she would die

Sassi has left his job at a factory 
making plastic milk bottles to help his wife care for Thusha, who is 
being eased back into a school routine for two hours a day, two days a 
week before she returns full-time later this year.

Thusha
has had to start a new school because her old one didn’t have enough 
wheelchair access. ‘I’ve got a new uniform, which is blue, and although I
miss my old friends I hope I’ll make lots of new ones from my class,’ 
she said. ‘I love being back in lessons.

‘My
dad’s been helping me this week and staying with me while  I get used 
to school. I was a bit  nervous about going back and quite shy at first.
I know I will get used to going to school again. I have really missed 
it while I have been ill and I want to learn and pass my tests so  I can
be a doctor when I grow up.’

Despite
her injuries, Thusha remains fiercely independent and is determined to 
help out around the house. Her father said: ‘She will often come into 
the kitchen and ask her mum if she needs any help. She’ll volunteer to 
chop up the  vegetables or help with the cooking. She has such a sweet 
nature.’

The couple have 
been touched by the public’s response to their daughter’s plight – 
thousands of well-wishers have donated £140,000 to a fund aimed at 
helping to pay for future medical treatment for her.

Sharmila said: ‘Sometimes things can seem very grim, but we cannot allow ourselves to become bitter.

‘We have to believe that there are enough decent people out there, and the response has shown us that there are.’
