Albert and Fred Trethewey were born 45 minutes apart - but have been together almost every minute ever since.

They shared the same interests at school, took turns to play right midfield in the football team - and joined the RAF on the same day.

Now they have celebrated their 90th birthday in the house they still share together.

Timeless twins: Albert and Fred Trethewey live together and have just celebrated their 90th birthday

Albert said: ‘We're plodding along like we always have, doing the same things, watching the football.

‘There's
really very little difference between us. We're been watching one 
another's back for 90 years but that's what twins are for.’

Fred added: ‘We are lucky to have each other, it's a lovely thing, we never feel lonely.’

The brothers, from Torpoint in Cornwall, were born 45 minutes apart on December 4, 1922, to parents Emmie and James.

Growing up they had the same interests.

Albert said: ‘We were both into football
and chasing the females. And if you ever got into a fight you always 
knew there was someone coming to help you out.’

Now and then: The inseparable duo remain as close now as they were aged 14 (left) when they took turns to play right midfield in the football team at the school they went to together

The pair joined the RAF aged 15 and served a two-year apprenticeship. They were posted overseas and served in Deli, Bombay and Karachi

They
attended the same school and in 1938 aged just 15 
they joined the RAF on the same day and served a two-year apprenticeship.

Albert said: 'We took the exams at school for the army and the air force - we picked the air force.'

After passing out, the pair served in 
RAF Coastal Command at Cornwall's RAF St Eval, a Second World War 
airbase that provided anti-submarine and anti-shipping patrols off the 
south west coast of Britain. 

The base was heavily bombed by the 
Luftwaffe while the twins were stationed there but they survived and 
went on to see service further afield in North Africa, Singapore, and 
cities including Bombay and Karachi, where they struggled with the harsh
climate.

Fred said: 'The temperatures got so 
hot we had a fortnight in the hills, right up in the hills, to get rid 
of prickly heat - a terrible thing where you come out in a rash.'

Inseparable: Fred and Albert Trethewey aged 28. This picture was taken after the brothers returned from India in 1950

Identical: The twins pictured during their service for the RAF. As well as working in India, they served in several places throughout the UK

He added: ‘Albert went to Bombay and I
went to Karachi. We were back together for a while then I went to 
Bombay and Albert to Karachi.

‘We went through some rough times in India, what with the war and the diseases you catch. We've both had our knees done.’

Following 12 years of service the twins 
returned to the UK, describing their civilian work as 'boring' compared 
to their RAF adventures.

They then worked for their brother-in-law who owned the Millbrook Steam Boat company before retiring together.

That's what twins are for: The pair has always looked out for each other even after Fred married his wife Betty

In the 1950s, Fred married Betty Williams and they had two boys, Jim, now 55, and John, now 50, followed by six grandchildren.

Albert said: 'When Fred got married I stayed at home to look after mother. I guess I couldn't find anyone who would have me.’

Mrs Trethewey passed away 20 years ago and Albert, who never married, moved into Fred's home where the 90-year-old twins say they do ‘everything together’.

The brothers had three sisters Winifred, Doreen and Margery, but are the last surviving siblings.
