The first pictures have emerged of a 4-year-old girl who was tragically killed Wednesday when a driver crashed a vehicle into her Florida childcare center as she was waiting for her afternoon snack and then fled off.

Little Lily Quintus was killed and 14 others were injured in the horror crash at KinderCare daycare center in Winter Park. On Thursday afternoon, police announced Robert Alex Corchado - the man they believe caused the fatal wreck - had turned himself in.

Lily was sitting at a table waiting 
for her afternoon snack when the car crashed into the building, and 
her heartbroken mother, Nicole Quintus, said a teacher called her soon after screaming but 
unable to say what happened.

'One minute everything was normal and 
the next there was an explosion and smoke and screams,' she said 
Thursday. Quintus said three surgeons fought to save her daughter's life
 but it was too late.

The Florida Highway Patrol said police agencies statewide were alerted to look for 26-year-old Corchado, who has a long criminal history.Â 

At about 4:30 p.m., officials confirmed Corchado was being processed at the Orange County Jail.

He is accused of sparking the incident when his Dodge Durango hit a convertible, which smashed into the building the children were in.

FHP Major Cindy Williams had revealed Corchado has ties to the Latin Kings gang and likely has friends who have helped him hide since Wednesday's crash. Authorities had issued a $5,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.

Earlier, Nicole Quintus had pleaded for Corchado to turn himself in.

'Come forward,' she said in an 
interview with The Associated Press.

'Families are
 emotionally destroyed because of what he did.'

The
 mother softly sobbed as she spoke of her daughter. She said Lily loved 
princesses, 'Star Wars,' the TV series 'Doctor Who' and ranch dressing 
on seemingly everything she ate - even pizza and hot dogs.

The girl's 7-year-old brother is an aspiring engineer who wants to design a time machine to bring Lily back, the mother added.

'She was beautiful and passionate and innocent and she deserved so much more.'

A GoFundMe page has been set up to raise money for the girl's family.

Lily
 Quintus was on the minds of those who turned up at the day care, where 
the gaping hole was boarded up with plywood and a cluster of stuffed 
animals, flowers and candles were left in memoriam.

Ralph
 Velez, 48, left a stuffed bear from his 5-year-old son Xavier, who goes
 to the day care but was unhurt. The bear was a gift from a few 
Christmases ago, and Xavier - who can't stop talking about the crash - 
wanted to give it to honor his friends, Velez said.

'He'll
 say, "stupid car," or "stupid driver,"' Velez said. 'He told us last 
night that he remembers the driver getting out and saying, "What did I 
do? What did I do?"'

Local television footage showed small 
children and infants in cribs being taken outside to the day care's 
playground in the Wednesday incident.

Several
 of those injured were carried out on stretchers. Parents were later 
seen waiting to pick up their children, then clutching them in their 
arms as authorities escorted them to their vehicles.

Corchado
 has been arrested eight times since 2000. Department of Corrections 
records show he served prison time for trafficking cocaine and 
extortion.

Disbelief: Rescue officials say 15 people, including 11 children, were injured including Lily in the horror wreck

He most 
recently was arrested in December on a misdemeanor charge of leaving the
 scene of a crash involving damage, a felony charge of selling 
narcotics, and felony marijuana possession.

He was released on more than
 $10,000 bond and pleaded not guilty to the charges. He was due back in 
court in May.

Jack Kaleita, 
an attorney representing Corchado in that case, did not return a call 
seeking comment Thursday. A man who answered the phone at a number 
listed for Corchado hung up.

In
 all, 13 people were hospitalized and two others were treated at the 
scene, authorities said. Eleven of the injured were children, said John 
Mulhall, a spokesman for the Orange County Fire Rescue.

Besides
 Quintus, seven victims were brought to the Arnold Palmer Hospital for 
Children, where one remained in critical condition Thursday and two in 
serious condition.

The day 
care's website says the center provides childcare and learning 
opportunities for children up to 12 years old and has been in the 
community for more than 25 years.
