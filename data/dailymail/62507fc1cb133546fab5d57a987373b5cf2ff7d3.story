If you thought Fifty Shades and Harry Potter porn pushed the boundaries of good taste, then prepare to be shocked.

Dinosaur erotica looks set to be the latest niche craze in the world of sexy fiction as a trio of books on the topic is released to buy for the Kindle.

The naughty novels, with titles such as Running From The Raptor and Taken by the T-Rex focus on the fantasy of helpless young women being attacked and seduced by dinosaurs.

I wanna T-Rex you up: The erotic titles are by two authors who also produce orc and dragon porn

Jezebel reports that the books, which are short stories of no more than 20 pages long, are the work of two authors, Christie Sims and Alara Branwen, who also write dragon, orc and weretiger erotica.

The books, which are available to buy on Amazon, state in their seller description: ’Warning: This is a tale of beast sex. This story was written to unlock your darkest fantasies and innermost desires. It is not for the faint of heart and is not your mother's erotica.’

The book covers feature a scantily dressed young woman gazing lustfully out from some wild scene, with a dinosaur lurking sinisterly - or sexily, if that's your thing - in the background.

In the Velociraptor's Nest centers around a cave woman called Azog

The dinosaur porn imagines a world where humans and dinosaurs existed together.

For the tale of In the Velociraptor’s Nest the protagonist Azog is a cavewoman, under appreciated in her tribe.

The synopsis says: ‘The cavemen treat her like a piece a meat. Azog cannot resist unless she proves herself as a hunter.

‘When she goes out in search of fresh meat, she discovers a clutch of baby velociraptors and decides to kill them and triumphantly bring them back to her tribe.

‘That is, until their father shows up and blocks Azog’s way out of the cave. Azog must use all of her womanly wiles to get out of the cave, which includes doing things she had never dreamed of.’

The dinosaur stories come in the wake of a flurry of unusual porn genres, which have flourished thanks to the Kindle.

The success of EL James's Fifty Shades trilogy was put down largely to the fact that women could download the books to their e-reader, thus preventing them the embarrassment of buying the books and reading them in public.

Sims and Branwen's books are books are available to download from Amazon to the Kindle.

'Azog stood, back to the wall, clad only in damp buckskins, waiting for the beast to slash at her torso until she lay helpless and bleeding on the damp cave floor.

'She wondered if it would kill her first, or if her limbs would be sliced from her body as the beast gorged on her.

'Instead, it reached out with a clawed hand to snatch at her damp animal hide as it clung to one shoulder.

'Azog felt the kiss of sharp claws against her skin as the hide slid from her shoulder and exposed on naked, heaving breast.

'The raptor paused, curious, sniffing at her as she pressed desperately against the wall.

A reptilian tongue, stiff and hot, dashed out to lick at the tender, naked flesh so suddenly exposed.

Azog gasped at the touch, then gradually relaxed as her body warmed to the intoxicating sensation of the beast's flesh against her own.'
