The police helicopter which crashed into a busy Glasgow pub killing 10 people suffered a double engine failure, an interim report has revealed.

The Eurocopter EC135 plunged into the roof of the Clutha bar in November last year - claiming the lives of all three people onboard and a further seven pub-goers.

Now, Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has found that both engines 'flamed out' during the final stages of the flight.

Wreckage: The Eurocopter EC135 plunged into the roof of the Clutha bar in the city centre - claiming the lives of all three people onboard and a further seven pub-goers. Above, emergency personnel examine the wreckage

Recovery: The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has found both engines 'flamed out' during the  flight

However, it added that the cause of problem was not clear - with 76kg (168lb) of fuel left in the helicopter's main fuel tank when it crashed.

Investigators are also trying to determine why no Mayday call was made before the crash, and why the aircraft was not able to make a controlled landing.

In its report, the AAIB said 
the helicopter had 400kg (882lb) of fuel on board - sufficient for about
 one hour and 35 minutes of flight - when it left Glasgow City Heliport 
at 8.45pm on November 29.

At 10.18pm, the pilot 
requested clearance from air traffic control to re-enter the Glasgow 
control zone to return to the heliport.

Mission: The report added that the cause of problem was not clear - with 76kg (168lb) of fuel left in the helicopter's main fuel tank when it crashed.  Above, rescue workers lift the helicopter wreckage from the bar

This was approved and no further
 radio transmissions were received from the pilot.

The report went 
on: 'Recorded data indicates that, in the latter stages of the flight, 
the right engine flamed out, and shortly after the left engine flamed 
out.

'The helicopter descended and stuck the roof of the Clutha 
Vaults bar at a high rate of descent, in an upright attitude. Evidence 
indicates that the rotor blades and Fenestron tail rotor were not 
rotating at the moment of impact.

'The last recoded radar position for 
the helicopter was at 10.22pm showing it at an altitude of approximately
 400ft (122m) amsl (above mean sea level).'

The AAIB said it had been
 closely examining the helicopter's fuel system, but there was no evidence 
that fuel had leaked from the aircraft before or during the impact with 
the pub.

The report said: 'Examination of all internal pipework 
and transfer passages has not revealed any pre- or post-impact failure 
and all paths still permit (correct) uninterrupted fuel flow.

'It has
 been established that unrestricted flow was also available from each 
supply tank to the corresponding engine fuel control unit, through the 
relevant fuel shut-off valves which were found set to the 'open' 
position.'

More than 100 people were in the popular Clutha bar, near the River Clyde, when the helicopter plunged into the venue's roof.

Among the fatalities were the doomed aircraft's crew members - David Traill, 51, and police officers Kirsty Nelis, 36, and Tony Collins, 43.

Six pub-goers were also killed when the helicopter struck, including Robert Jenkins, 61, Mark O'Prey, 44, Colin Gibson, 33, John McGarrigle, 57, Gary Arthur, 48, and Samuel McGhee, 56.

Customer
 Joe Cusker, 59, was pulled from the wreckage alive, but died in hospital
 from his injuries almost two weeks later.

A further 32 people were injured in the crash - 12 of whom suffered serious injuries.

In the wake of the crash, there have been calls for a public inquiry into the safety of all commercial flights in the UK.

Victim: Helicopter pilot David Traill, 51, had been flying back to the Glasgow City Heliport when the aircraft was seen falling from the sky

Last month, it emerged that the helicopter operator had begun making interim payments to the victims.

Thompsons
 Solicitors, who are representing more than 50 victims of the Clutha 
tragedy, said the move would help their clients cover loss of salary 
while compensation is agreed.

John Fyall, spokesman for helicopter 
operator Bond Air Services, said: 'This is another step in the AAIB's 
systematic investigative process. All concerned understand this process 
will be a long and complex investigation.

'While the investigation 
continues, we would urge against speculation. We owe it to the memories 
of those who died, those who were injured, and the families affected by 
this tragedy to help the investigation team answer as many questions as 
possible and discover exactly what happened.

'We continue to support 
the investigations and our thoughts remain with all those who have been 
touched by this tragedy. We also continue to work with Glasgow City 
Council and other parties to support bereaved families and the local 
community.'

Meanwhile, airline pilots' group Balpa said today's report - the second interim inquiry into the crash - is 'the next step in establishing what happened in Glasgow'.

A spokesman said: 'Pilots want 
every flight to be safe through full and proper investigation of 
incidents and accidents like this one.

On duty: Police officers Tony Colins, 43, and 
Kirsty Nellis, 36, were both on board the helicopter when it crashed

Devastating: Pub-goers Mark O'Prey, 44, and Samuel McGhee, 56,Â  died when the helicopter struck the venue

'We now know that the engines 
were not running at the time of the crash and it appears this was to do 
with the fuel system. However, pilots, like the AAIB, will not be 
satisfied until this is explored further and the exact reason for that 
failure is identified.'

'The AAIB have our continued support in their 
work.'

No CCTV recordings had been obtained which captured the end of the flight - while recorded radio transmissions did not contain any reference by the crew to difficulties with the aircraft.

The AAIB stressed today that it had 
not attempted an analysis of the facts in the interim report - known as
 a special bulletin.

Deceased: Colin Gibson, 33, left, was killed in the Glasgow helicopter crash, along with Robert Jenkins, 61

Sad: John McGarrigle, 57, died in the disaster, as did Gary Arthur, 48, who was the first victim named by police

It said it had published the document 'to provide more factual 
information and an update on the progress of the investigation'.

It comes as a book of condolences signed by MPs has been handed to the city by Commons Speaker John Bercow.

Mr Bercow presented Glasgow's Lord Provost Sadie Docherty with the book at the City Chambers this afternoon.

The book was placed in the House of Commons for MPs, peers and staff to sign in the aftermath of the tragedy.

Glasgow City Council's own book of 
condolence was signed by the Prince of Wales when he visited the city to
 meet survivors and members of the emergency services.

The council headquarters also holds books from the Scottish Parliament and Liverpool Town Hall.

Earlier
 today, the Lord Provost said: 'I am touched that Mr Bercow is visiting 
our city to personally hand over the House of Commons Book of 
Condolence. I look forward to meeting him and making him welcome.'
