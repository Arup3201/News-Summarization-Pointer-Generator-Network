A new report has cleared the Secret Service in any institutional wrongdoing and blamed the Colombian prostitution scandal on a few misbehaved agents.

'Although individual employees have engaged in misconduct or inappropriate behavior, we did not find evidence that misconduct is widespread,' the Inspector General's report says.

The other most egregious example of professional misconduct came in the form of one incident in 2010 that was described as being 'similar to Cartagena.

Brushing past it: The report says that the agency does not have institutional issues but just problems with certain agents who were found to solicit prostitutes and drink with locals while prepping for presidential visits

Many of the identifying details of that incident have been redacted, but ABC News does tell how the agent in question was abroad 'in support of a presidential visit' and drank with locals before he was spotted arriving at the airport with locals that day.

Unlike the public debacle that ensued following the Cartagena incident, this 2010 occurrence did not lead to any thorough investigation and the agent in question had their proposed sanctions withdrawn.

'Individuals consumed alcohol; interacted with (female foreign nationals); and were untruthful when initially questioned by managers,' the report reads according to The Washington Post.

In addition to brushing past the Cartagena, Colombia scandal that occurred in May 2012, the 18-month investigation also found that there were a handful of reports of agents soliciting prostitutes including one as recent as this year.

Again details were scant in the report, but the agent who 'engaged in sexual activity in exchange for money' earlier this year had his security credentials report.

All told, the report did not find that 'employees frequently engage in behaviors... that could cause a security concern'.

'Furthermore, we did not find any evidence that [Secret Service] leadership has fostered an environment that tolerates inappropriate behavior.'

That statement comes well after the agency's response, as Julia Pierson was promoted to lead the Secret Service in the wake of the scandal's blowback.

Administrators are going to have trouble defending the findings, however, as many have questioned the way in which the investigation was completed.

Even though technically the investigators heard back from 2,575 employees, their responses came through an anonymous online survey

Ms Pierson, the first female head of the male-dominated industry, slammed the report, wrote that survey participants were told to 'speculate about the personal, sexual, and potential criminal activities of co-workers' based largely on 'rumor and gossip'.

She attached a copy of her letter to the report, which will be released fully today, and tried to assure the public that while the findings may be flawed, the agency has made a number of efforts to right  some of the apparent wrongs.

The report cited 14 possible ways for the agency to improve, 11 of which have already been implemented.

‘The criticality of the Secret Service’s mission demands that we maintain the highest levels of integrity in our workforce. I remain committed to investigating and adjudicating all instances of misconduct that are brought to my attention,’ she wrote.

The prostitution incident that occurred this year that was alluded to in the report was not the agency’s most recent embarrassment, however, as two Secret Service agents on President Obama's detail were reprimanded in May after one was caught trying to force himself into a woman's hotel room to collect a bullet that he had left there after meeting her hours before in the hotel bar.

Ignacio Zamora Jr., who works as a senior supervisor in charge of more than 20 agents, was investigated by his superiors after a hotel staffer reported his unusual behavior. The ensuing investigation also found that he and another agent, Timothy Barraclough, were sending sexually suggestive emails to a female subordinate.

Both men have now been suspended from the Secret Service and the incident remains under investigation.
