One of the men suspected of butchering a British soldier on a London street has been discharged from hospital today - and further arrested for the attempted murder of a police officer.

Terror suspect Michael Adebolajo has been receiving treatment in hospital after he was shot by armed police officers following the horrific murder of Lee Rigby in Woolwich.

Today, the Metropolitan Police said the 28-year-old was discharged from hospital and taken into custody at a south London police station for questioning.

After arriving

suspicion of the attempted murder of a police officer.

It also emerged that police officers 
investigating the murder of Mr Rigby arrested two other men today on 
suspicion of being involved in the supply of illegal firearms.

Yesterday, Michael Adebowale, 22, of Greenwich, appeared before magistrates charged with Lee Rigby's murder.

A spokesman for the Met said: 'A 
28-year-old man arrested on 22 May on suspicion of the murder of Drummer
