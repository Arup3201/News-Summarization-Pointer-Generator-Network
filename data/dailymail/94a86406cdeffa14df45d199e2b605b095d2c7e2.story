Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and his wife Therese Rein are ready to say goodbye to their family home of more than 20 years, with photos of the beautiful house allowing an insight into the former Labor leader's family life. 

It's the home where Mr Rudd realised his dream of becoming Prime Minister and became his retreat when he saw those hopes dashed.

To ensure there is no doubt this tropical Queenslander home belongs to Kevin Rudd, a kangaroo and emu emblem has pride of place on the veranda's lattice - twice.

After ten weeks on the market the five-bedroom Norman Park property in Brisbane's east is under contract.

The couple bought the Norman Crescent home in 1994 for $384,000 and are now hoping to cash in with an asking price of $1.19 million. 

The property was first put on the market in mid-November for $1.25 million before they were forced to drop their asking price.

The polished but warm home is the place the former Prime Minister and his wife Therese Rein raised their three children, Jessica, Marcus and Nicholas.

'Sad to farewell our family home after 20 years as K & I get some more Sunny Coast sand between the toes. :) Hope a new family loves it too,' Therese Rein had announced on Twitter. 

The city sanctuary is a breath of fresh air, with a stunning garden surrounding the home, filled with lush green ferns, beautiful old trees and tropical palms.

It appears in photographs and for inspections without styling, meaning the furnishings and decorations are exactly as chosen and enjoyed by the Rudd family. 

The modern kitchen has grey marble bench tops and state of the art appliances. There is an island bench and beautiful wooden and glass cupboards

The property is an understated but nonetheless stunning home which is perfect for a family, young or old.

It is a classic colonial home with the warmth of a country property yet the convenience of its proximity to the city, schools and public transport, including the CityCat and ferry services.

The extra private home has a north-east facing wraparound balcony on the upper level and a corrugated iron roof- a calming space for a busy PM overlooking the lush surroundings.

The spacious home has extra high ceilings, fresh wooden panel walls and original hoop pine polished floors throughout.

The Rudd family say the property will be 'sadly missed' after over 20 years of memories.

In November last year they sold a nearby site, also in Norman Park, where they had once planned to build their dream home.

The block alone cost $1.4 million in 2011 – more than the expected price of their current Norman Park home.

The Rudds were also disappointed when they sold the building block, which overlooks the city and the river, at a significant loss for just $1,751,000.

The couple will now make what they called their 'other home' their base - a luxury property in Noosa just a stone's throw to some of Australia's most breathtaking beaches.
