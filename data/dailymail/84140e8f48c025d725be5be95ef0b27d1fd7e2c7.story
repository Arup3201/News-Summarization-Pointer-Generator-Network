The winner of a contest to find the best bottom in Brazil has been crowned despite allegations two candidates bribed judges to rig the votes. 

In its third year, Miss BumBum has a huge following in the country and around the world and titleholders often go on to become national celebrities. 

This year's winner was Dai Macedo, 25, from the central state of Goias, who impressed judges with her 42in derrière.

Eliana Amaral, from Pernambuco in north Brazil, was awarded second place while bringing up the rear was Jessica Amaral from the central northern region of Para who came third.

Ms Macedo, an administration student, had been embroiled in controversy leading up the event when she suggested on social media that the result would be fixed to give the title to rival Mari Sousa.

The contest was plunged into further chaos when rivals accused Ms Sousa, 25, and Ms Amaral, 24, of paying thousands of pounds to the event's judging panel for the right to come first and second. 

Brazil's O Dia newspaper reported that Ms Amaral, a law student representing the northeastern state of Pernambuco, had allegedly paid organisers around £18,000 for second place.

The O Dia newspaper also alleged that Ms
 Amaral's impressive derriere is not entirely natural - which would 
eliminate her from the competition - and that an X-ray she says proves 
she has no implants in her bottom is fake.

Contestants took to Twitter to insult each other in the lead up to the competition.

Speaking after her win, Ms Macedo said: 'I'm all emotional. I didn't expect to win.

'All hell broke loose on social media sites but now I can say the contest was real.'

The new Miss Bumbum indicated her backside had not always been such a marketable asset.

'It isn't 100 per cent natural. I had a butt lift. I always had a large backside but liposuction improved it,' she said. 

The brunette said she hoped one day to become a television presenter.

Macedo also won 5,000 reais ($2,100)  and will also net ten times that in advertising contracts.

The Miss Bumbum contest begins with 27 candidates chosen to represent each of Brazil's 26 states and the federal district Brasilia.

The women are then whittled down to a final 15 in an online eliminatory round, before a winner is chosen by a judging panel of six women and five men.

Second place has also become a coveted position after previous years' runners up have achieve greater fame than the actual winners.
