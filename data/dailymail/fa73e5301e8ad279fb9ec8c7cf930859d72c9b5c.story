A top brain cancer specialist and his doctor wife died after a plane he piloted crashed in Ohio yesterday.

Indian-American Dr Viswanathan Rajaraman, 54 and Dr Mary J Sundaram, 50, had arrived in Columbus on Friday after visiting their daughter, Kaavya Viswanathan, in Washington D.C.

It appears the couple were on their way home to New Jersey when the single-engine Cirrus CR22 plane crashed shortly after take off.

Tragic: Dr. Vishy Rajaraman was piloting the plane that crashed killing him and his wife Dr Mary J Sundaram

Doug Smith, a battalion chief with the Columbus Division of Fire, said 
fire-fighters from nearby Rickenbacker were checking equipment and saw the 
plane go down shortly before 9 am.

Crews were at the crash scene within
two minutes, Smith said.

Fire fighters added the plane burst into flames after hitting the ground, with little of the wreckage left after it was extinguished.

Today FAA investigators were at the crash scene trying to work out what went wrong.

According to the Columbus Dispatch the small aircraft had a parachute system capable of lowering the plane to the ground in an emergency.

According to chief Smith an explosive charge should activate the parachute system but a container with the explosive charge was found 30 yards behind the debris, he said.

The
parachute, found nearby, had not deployed.

Charred: Not much was left of the plane after fire fighters put out the flames

Mr Rajaraman was chief of neuro oncology at the Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center.

Plagiarism: Kaavya Viswanathan had her book published while at Harvard and became embroiled in a plagiarism scandal

The expert surgeon specialised in non-invasive treatments that included using radiation to destroy inoperable brain tumors.

The couple were thought to have been on their way home after visiting their daughter, 24-year-old Kaavya Viswanathan who recently graduated from Georgetown University law school.

Miss Viswanathan hit the headlines in 2006 after becoming embroiled in a plagiarism scandal surrounding her book, How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life.

She won the $500,000 two book deal with a publisher Little, Brown and Co while still in high school.

But soon after publishing it emerged portions of the book bore a striking resemblance to another work and the contract was rescinded.

Mrs  Sundaram was trained as a gynaecologist, but it is understood she gave her career up to raise the couple's daughter.
