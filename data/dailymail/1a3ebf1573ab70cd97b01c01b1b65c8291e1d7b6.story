Manchester United defender Phil Jones has given the club a boost by returning to full training.

Jones has not played since a shin injury forced him out after the draw at West Brom in late October.

Now, however, the 22-year-old has been told he can train fully again after resting the problem for a number of weeks.

Chris Smalling will be out for two weeks after an injury sustained at Southampton on Monday night 

Jones will not figure when United take on old enemies Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday.

But the England defender hopes to be available over the Christmas period. So far he has played for new United manager only four times.

Fellow centre half Chris Smalling is out for two weeks after injuring his groin in Monday night's win at Southampton.

Smalling's injury was the latest in a long line of muscle problems to afflict Louis van Gaal's squad this season, leading to suggestions there is a problem with the United manager's training methods.

Manager Louis van Gaal has overseen a chronic amount of injuries since taking charge in the summer
