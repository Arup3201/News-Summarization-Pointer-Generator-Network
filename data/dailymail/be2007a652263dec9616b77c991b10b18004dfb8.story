Ed Miliband today faced questions over how much he is worth as the Labour leader tried to play down claims he was targeting David Cameron’s background for political advantage.

The morning after his widely-praised conference speech, Mr Miliband was forced to defend claims the Prime Minister would personally benefit from a ‘tax cut for millionaires’ but refused to discuss his own levels of personal wealth.

In his speech, Mr Miliband said: ‘David Cameron isn’t just writing the cheques. He is receiving one. He’s going to be getting the millionaire’s tax cut.

‘So next week maybe Mr Cameron can tell us how much is he awarding himself in a tax cut? How much is that tax cut he is awarding himself?’

But he appeared to row back from the claim today, after business experts accused him of confusing people with net assets worth more than £1million with the much smaller group who earn seven-figure sums every year.

Asked on BBC Breakfast how much he was worth, Mr Miliband replied: ‘I am not going to be getting the top rate tax cut.’

But pressed on whether he was ‘worth £1million’, Mr Miliband looked panicked and tried to claim he was not using the Prime Minister’s upbringing to gain votes. ‘I am not making an issue of David Cameron’s background.’

Mr Miliband, whose Primrose Hill home is reportedly worth £1.6million, criticised the Prime Minister for cutting the top-rate of tax and said he didn't think "it was the kind of country we should be in".

But in the same interview he attacked Mr Cameron for cutting the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p for those earning more than £150,000, and claimed the PM will benefit personally.

‘Mr Cameron's aides have said he will be receiving a tax cut in the top rate of tax when it is cut from 50 to 45 per cent,’ Mr Miliband said.

‘Why does that matter? That matters because if you're the Prime Minister and you're cutting taxes for a very small section of the population and raising them for everyone else.

‘You're cutting taxes for the richest in society. I think that's wrong, I don't think that's the kind of country we should be in.'

Yesterday Mr Miliband’s speech was packed with references to his own upbringing, attending a comprehensive school in North London, which was seen as an attempt to contrast with Mr Cameron’s schooling at Eton.

He said that as a pupil at Haverstock school he ‘learned how to get on with people from all backgrounds, whoever they were’.

Tory MPs have accused the Labour leader of indulging in ‘class war’ by making a big play of his educational background to contrast with David Cameron’s Eton schooling.

Graham Evans said it was ‘a bit rich’ for him to pretend he is from a down-to-earth background when his family were very wealthy and came from the ‘Labour elite’.

Four of Mr Miliband’s shadow Cabinet colleagues – including Harriet Harman and Ed Balls – were privately educated.

Mr Miliband received largely positive coverage for yesterday’s speech, delivered without notes or an autocue.

Today he revealed that the 65-minute address had been longer than he originally planned.

‘The notes for the speech, such that they were, were 6,000 words and I delivered 7,500,’ he told BBC Radio 4.

‘People are fed up with politics which feels like it is reading out something that someone else has written for you. I tried to say what I believed and that is the best thing to do.’

Despite using much of the speech to distance himself from New Labour, attacking its failures on welfare and immigration, Mr Miliband said he was 'flattered' at being compared to Tony Blair.'I think I’m pretty flattered by that comparison, Tony Blair was incredible at conference speeches. But it’s a different time.

'What I do feel, the reason I did that speech yesterday, was that people want to know about who the person is, where we're going to take the country.'
