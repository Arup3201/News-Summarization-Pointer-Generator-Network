Garret Doherty might be a world champion runner but you won’t see him at this summer’s Olympics because he only runs backwards.

Mr Doherty, 33, from Dublin, is the world’s fastest backwards runner and incredibly, is able to cover a mile in just over seven minutes.

And after being crowned world champion for three years on the trot, he is returning to the UK backwards running championships, held in Manchester tomorrow, to defend his title.

Backwards is the new forwards: Garret Doherty, 33, from Dublin, is the world's fastest backwards runner and incredibly, is able to cover a mile in just over seven minutes

Mr Doherty got hooked on the bizarre sport three years ago when he turned around to avoid the sun’s glare while out on a jog.

And despite constant stares from baffled passers-by, he discovered he could run nearly as fast backwards as he could forwards - and claims his life has been transformed by the craze.

Mr Doherty said: 'Backwards running is like a drug, once you start, you’ll never want to run forwards again.

'It’s truly liberating, and there are enormous health benefits. It’s much better for your body than running forwards, as it’s lower impact.

'People usually have to do a double take when they see me whizzing past when I’m training.

'I’m always getting passers-by shouting at me, telling me I’m going the wrong way.

'But who says I’m going the wrong way and everyone else is going the right way?'

Mr Doherty competed in his first backwards running race at the UK championships in Manchester in 2009.

He regularly trains across the UK, and has been training in Birmingham and London on the run up to this weekend’s big race.

Speedy: Mr Doherty claims to have only fallen three times since he started running backwards but he does admit to taking a forwards-running friend with him to act as his eyes

Despite the obvious trip hazards, Mr Doherty claims to have only fallen three times since he started running backwards.

However, he does admit to taking a forwards-running friend with him to act as his eyes when he trains on unfamiliar or busy terrain.

Mr Doherty, who gave up his job as a bicycle rickshaw operator and now tours schools in a bid to convert children to backwards running, had always been a keen jogger.

But it was only when he was forced to turn away from the glaring sun on an evening jog that he ever thought about going backwards.

He explained: 'The sun was so bright I had to turn away, but I didn’t want to turn round and go home.

'I just thought I’d try facing the other direction and running backwards for a while and it was great.

'My body felt much better after running backwards as well, and I went and researched backwards running properly.

'I couldn’t believe how many people around the world were into it and there were so many competitions to enter.'

Mr Doherty has travelled the world entering backwards running competitions and has been crowned champion in cities across the UK and Ireland, as well as in international games held in Austria.

He completed the mile-long UK championship in 2010 in an impressive time of seven minutes 30 seconds.

And last month, he finished the Wexford half marathon in an astonishing time of just one hour 40 minutes after running all of it backwards.

Mr Doherty is now dedicating his life to converting people to backwards running and claims the health benefits alone are enough to convince people to give it a go.

He said: 'You burn three times as many calories running backwards as running forwards, as it uses a lot more muscles.

'You land on the correct part of your feet, which helps your ligaments and ankle bones.

'In forwards running, your feet land heel to toe but when you run backwards it’s the other way round, which is how you’re supposed to run, the same way as you would barefoot.

'And instead of the muscles in your lower back getting the workout, it’s the muscles in your lower abdomen that are worked the hardest.

'Backwards running also improves your posture and encourages you to stand and run with your shoulders back.

'If it wasn’t for people being too embarrassed to run backwards, it would be a lot better for everyone to do it.'

The organiser of the UK championships, held in Heaton Park, Manchester tomorrow, James Bamber said: 'Most of the people who enter our races do it for a bit of fun, but there are a handful of dedicated backwards runner out there who train all year round and never miss a race.

'I can tell you from personal experience that unless you have trained for months beforehand, your legs will know they’ve been through a stiff workout and to even manage the whole race without resorting to a slow shuffle would be a massive achievement.

“It’s a little-known fact that backward running is not only a great workout, but can actually prevent injury and is a very valuable exercise for athletes rehabilitating from knee injuries.'
