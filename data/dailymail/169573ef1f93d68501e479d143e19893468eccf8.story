19-year-old Gigi Hadid who hails from Los Angeles is quickly becoming one of the top models in the world, having landed herself incredible campaigns and making a name for herself on the fashion scene

Of course, she has all the makings of a supermodel, and it's not just about her obvious good looks and jet-setting lifestyle.

Gigi, of course, runs with a seriously cool crowd. As well as Kendall, she's often spotted hanging out with Cara Delevingne or partying with Justin Bieber.  

And she's already bagged herself the ultimate model accessory: a popstar boyfriend. 

Gigi has been dating Australian singer Cody Simpson on and off since 2013. And at the moment it looks like the pair are most definitely on. 

The aesthetically blessed young couple were spotted over the weekend hanging out at Miami beach kissing in the surf.

Some might say that Gigi's modelling success has been a long time coming, as she first started working when she was just two years old when she was spotted by Paul Marciano of Guess.

She took a break so she could study, but picked up her career again after school. At recent fashion weeks, she walked for brands such as Dolce and Gabanna, Sonia Rykiel and Tom Ford - quickly becoming one of the most recognisable faces on the runway.

It was also recently announced that the young model is set to be the new face of beauty brand Maybelline. 

And Gigi's had the praise heaped on her by some of the fashion industries biggest names. 

Last year Carine Roitfeld, the infamous former editor of Vogue Paris told Style of the model: 'I was drawn to her right away because she was so different, and I love girls that are different—different from me, different from what everyone has seen before. 

'I knew immediately that she was going to be a star.'

And at the beginning of the year she was named 'Model of The Year,' at the Daily Front Row fashion awards.  

And good looks seem to run in the family as Gigi's younger sister Bella is also a model. 

Gigi looked incredible in a 70s style outfit on the cover of Vogue Spain, the model says that when she goes on jobs she always tries to work hard 

When talking about her work ethic Gigi has previously said that she follows three rules when she's on a job. 

She told the Independent: 'Three things: work hard, be nice and make a friend.'

Gigi - who has previously landed the cover of Vogue Spain - says she also thinks it's important to connect with her fans and that this is something brands connect with. 

She said: 'Girls are following me because I’m a model and because they want to see the behind the scenes aspect of it. 

'They’re also following because there’s someone, hopefully, that they want to be friends with. And I think there are a lot of models that don’t understand it.'

Gigi is the face of GUESS, she previously Instagrammed this bill board which was spotted in Paris 

However, like most celebrities, Gigi has found that her increasing profile hasn't come without it's brushes with controversy. 

She was today forced to deny rumours that she had taken cocaine at a Victoria's Secret pool party this weekend. 

In a 10-second Snapchat video, taken of Gigi dancing with Cody on a balcony at the event the model appeared to bend close to a lowered surface at one point seemingly, 'snorting.' 

The model was quick to take to Twitter to lambast the rumours saying: 'If you actually watch the video there is nothing on the counter .5 seconds before you see that image.'

Gigi and Cody attended the Victoria's Secret Pink Ultimate Spring Break Bash this weekend, however, the models fun was marred when she was accused of taking drugs

She continued: 'I would never touch that... it's not only impossible but insane to me. Besides for doing the supposed in general, I'd be an idiot to do that at a WORK EVENT in front of hundreds of people/press. I'm insulted. 

'I take pride in being a good role model, would never touch that and will not stand or put up with a little piece of scum blog like YOU.' 

Ocean's Up is a blog which reported on the video which had been grabbed from Cody's snapchat account which is publicly accessible to his fans.
