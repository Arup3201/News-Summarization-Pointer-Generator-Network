These shocking CCTV images show the moment a solicitor was dragged along the street as a pair of robbers assaulted her, threatening to stab her unless she gave them the keys to her sports car.

Helen Crockett refused to let go of her bag as she was pulled along the ground and hit repeatedly by the attackers.

She was saved when a car drove towards the scene, near Leeds, West Yorkshire, but the robbers managed to get away with the keys to her BMW.

Clinging on: Brave Mrs Crockett refused to let go of her bag as the robber attempted to get her car keys

‘I was terrified but there was no way I was handing over my bag which had my keys inside,’ she said.

‘As soon as I saw them, I knew they were trouble so I tried to run but they grabbed me within seconds.

‘It was really scary, and it’s not the sort of thing you expect to happen to you, but I wasn’t giving up without a fight.

‘I fought back in the same way that I fight for my clients.’

The 5ft 6ins solicitor, who weighs less than eight stone, was attacked outside her family law practice in Harehills, Leeds, West Yorkshire.

She was leaving work at around 9pm when the pair pounced before she had time to drive off.

She said: ‘They were saying, “we have got a knife. Give us your keys and your bag”.

‘There was no way I was going to let it happen and become a victim. I had to stand up for myself, no matter what the consequences.

‘I was dragged down the street, and it seemed they were going to stop at nothing to get hold of my keys and my car.’

Help came when a car being driven by a woman drove up the road, prompting the attackers to flee - with her car key.

‘They managed to get my key out of my bag, despite me clinging on to the strap,’ she added.

‘I have had my law practice here since 1993 and I have always had BMWs so I don’t know why they have targeted me now.

‘It’s a nice car which I have only had since June, but I have always felt safe until now.

‘The police have suggested I get the bus to work from now on, but I won’t let them beat me.’

The robbers were both white. One was said to have blond hair and one was wearing an Adidas hooded top with a logo on the front and black or grey trainers with white soles. He was about 5ft 9ins tall.

The other was taller and wearing a dark grey hooded top with tassels on the hood and dark footwear with a white sole.
