Restaurant chain Ruby Tuesday is being sued for gender discrimination against men after only hiring women in the summer of 2013.

The lawsuit filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission demands compensation for two male employees denied their applications for a transfer.

It also calls for an injunction preventing the firm from favoring one gender.

Sexist? Two male employees of Ruby Tuesday, Andrew Herrera and Joshua Bell, claim they responded to an internal advert for temporary roles in Park City, Utah, but were denied 'because they are men'

The case comes just over a year after a court found Ruby Tuesday guilty of age discrimination at restaurants in six states, ordering the group to pay a $575,000 fine.

According to Andrew Herrera and Joshua Bell, they responded to an internal advert for temporary roles in Park City, Utah, but were denied, The Oregonian reported.

The positions would have come with a higher wage and free housing for two months.

Their suit claims the company, based in Tennessee, clearly favored female applicants and no men were hired due to gender discrimination.

Demands: The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission demands compensation for the two employees

'It's an unusual lawsuit,' John Stanley, a supervisory trial attorney for the EEOC in Seattle who has served 27 years with the commission, told the Oregonian.

'It's rare to see an explicit example of sex discrimination like Ruby Tuesday's internal job announcement,' noted EEOC San Francisco Regional Attorney William R Tamayo, according to a statement on the EEOC website.

'This suit is a cautionary tale to employers that sex-based employment decisions are rarely justified, and are not consistent with good business judgment.'
