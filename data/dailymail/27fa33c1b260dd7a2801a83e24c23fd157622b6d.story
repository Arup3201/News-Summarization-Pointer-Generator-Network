Adolf Hitler's grand plans for the 'supercapital' of the Third Reich, which he intended to rename Germania, are detailed in a new exhibition.

Staged in a vast Nazi bunker, 'The Myth of Germania: Vision and Crimes' features the 'Hall of the People' which was to be twice the size of St Peter's Basilica in Rome with room for 180,000 people.

A giant map shows plans for a five-mile-long boulevard designed to be flanked by towering buildings celebrating Nazi prestige.

The new city was to be the biggest in the world with a stadium (pictured), avenues and statues which Hitler proclaimed would last for 1,000 years

The new city was to be the biggest in the world with grand buildings, avenues and statues which Hitler proclaimed would last for 1,000 years.

But due to the war, all that was realised of Hitler's plans for Berlin are huge street lights on an avenue leading up to the Brandenburg Gate.

The Berlin exhibition reveals architect Albert Speer – who escaped the death penalty at the Nuremberg Trials after claiming not to know about the extermination of the Jews – was told to use Jewish slave labourers.

He ordered evictions in the demolition zones so building could be completed quickly once Germany had won the war.

Hitler's utopian plans to rebuild Berlin on a monumental scale were never realised, but the preparations involved demolitions and the use of slave labour

Curator Gernot Schaulinski said: 'This is not about 'Germania' as the hobby of a dictator It's about the intentions of such a project, the ideology behind it, and those who suffered because of it'

'Aryan' residents forced out were to move into 24,000 apartments formerly occupied by Berlin's Jews.

Curator Gernot Schaulinski said: 'This is not about 'Germania' as the hobby of a dictator It's about the intentions of such a project, the ideology behind it, and those who suffered because of it.'

The exhibition has been organised by the Berlin Underground association which explores and opens up Nazi-era bunkers and buildings for public show.

It is being staged in a vast bunker built by the Nazis in the Wedding district of Berlin which has become a tourist attraction in its own right.

To meet demand for construction materials for 'Germania', Hitler, Speer and SS military commander Heinrich Himmler agreed to use concentration camp inmates as manpower. 

The SS built the world's largest brickworks in Oranienburg, a camp near Berlin where many inmates were murdered or died from the work.
