The record company behind U2 and Lady Gaga was allegedly used by a drug-trafficking ring for its cases stuffed with cocaine and $20 bills.

Rap music manager James Rosemond, 46, known as ‘Jimmy Henchmen’ was indicted three months ago on drug trafficking charges.

Members of his organisation allegedly used musical equipment ‘road cases’ to send cocaine from Los Angeles, California, to New York.

On the way back the same cases were filled with hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, the Smoking Gun reported a court filing as saying.

This was allegedly going on for 18 months, but it’s not alleged Interscope Records knew or were involved in any drug shipments.

Prosecutors say it’s quite possible Interscope employees knew nothing about it, reported Fox News.

It is not yet understood how Mr 
Rosemond's team got access to Interscope's California headquarters to 
drop off and take the shipments.

The ring is alleged to have used a New York recording studio at the other end for the drug and cash shipments, reported the Wall Street Journal.

One act managed by Mr Rosemond and his firm Czar Entertainment is rapper The Game, who is signed to Interscope Records.

The cases were shipped by music gear 
specialists Rockit Cargo, but the filing doesn’t allege they knew what 
was inside. Rockit has not commented.

Interscope Records is part of Universal, which has not yet commented.

Mr Rosemond’s lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman denied the charges.
