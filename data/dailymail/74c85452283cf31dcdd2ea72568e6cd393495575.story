Patients face being charged up to £42-a-week to watch television in hospital while prisoners pay just £1, it emerged today.

David Cameron said he was ‘frustrated’ by the situation but admitted the government is powerless to stop health trusts from hitting inpatients with big levies to enjoy TV from their beds.

But the Prime Minister faced claims the difference in charges was ‘unjustifiable’ despite a crackdown on perks for inmates.

Disparity: Patients in hospital face being charged up to £42-a-week to watch television from their bed, the Commons was told while criminals in jail are charged just £1

Tory MP Philip Davies told the Commons he was appalled at the high cost of watching beside TV in hospitals.

He said: ‘I recently visited my brother in hospital in Doncaster only to find that using the television stationed above his bed would cost him £6 a day.’

He called on Mr Cameron to ‘justify why it costs hospital patients £42 a week to watch the television when it costs prisoners only £1 a week to do so’.

The Prime Minister said he had ‘spent a
lot of time in hospitals’ and shared Mr Davie’s ‘frustrations’ about a 
situation created by Labour.

Mr Cameron added: ‘It was the last Government who introduced these charges on televisions in hospital in the year 2000.

‘I
have spent many an hour battling with that very complicated telephone 
and credit card system that people have to try and make work. I am 
afraid, though, that these are devolved decisions that local hospitals 
can now make for themselves.’

Unjustifiable: Tory MP Philip Davies said the high costs were the result of government departments not communicating

However, Mr Cameron said Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is acting to crackdown on excessive perks in prisons.

‘He is taking the unacceptable situation that he inherited from the Labour party, whereby people could take out a Sky subscription when they were in prison, and saying that they cannot do that any more.

‘He is also making sure that prisoners pay if they use the television.’

A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman confirmed prisoners pay  £1 a week to watch television.

She added:  ‘That comes at no cost to taxpayers as prisoners pay for it themselves.’

But Mr Davies later told MailOnline that the situation could not be defended.

‘The fact is that anybody – and I suspect the Prime Minister is included – cannot justify the fact that hospital patients pay £42 and prisoners pay £1.

‘When government departments work in isolation you end up with these kind of perverse outcomes.

‘It is why government need to look overall to make sure you don’t end up with this sort of situation.’

The Patients Association has argued that patients should not have the ‘stress of a big bill on top of their bad health’.

From the end of next month, 18-rated DVDs will join extreme video games in being banned in all jails.

Sky Sports and other subscription channels, which are permitted in private prisons, will be switched off permanently during the summer.

In April prisons minister Jeremy Wright said: 'We just don’t think it’s right that prisoners should have access to subscription TV channels.

'We don’t think it’s right because there are plenty of my constituents who struggle to afford those things and they don’t see, and I don’t see, why prisoners should get them.'
