Nick Clegg is planning to make the decriminalisation of 'skunk' cannabis a key plank of his Election manifesto, despite shock research showing that the drug triples the risk of mental illness.

The Lib Dem leader risks provoking outrage this week when he joins Sir Richard Branson to put the case for removing all criminal sanctions for possessing cannabis – including skunk, its most potent form.

The move comes as party sources told The Mail on Sunday that a draft copy of the Lib Dem manifesto includes a pledge to end all prosecutions for possession of soft drugs.

Under the proposal, if police decide someone caught with cannabis or skunk was a user rather than a dealer, they would receive medical treatment instead of facing charges.

The plan was described by one senior Tory MP last night as 'completely and utterly irresponsible', given mounting evidence of the damage cannabis inflicts on teenage brains.

A landmark study revealed by this newspaper two weeks ago found that regularly smoking skunk triples the risk of psychosis, with the brightest teenagers among those most at risk.

Prof Sir Robin Murray, who led the Institute of Psychiatry study, linked the drug to an astonishing 24 per cent of first episode psychosis cases and said it was leaving some with permanent schizophrenia.

Mr Clegg's appearance with Sir Richard at the Chatham House think-tank on Wednesday risks triggering accusations of hypocrisy – as the Deputy Prime Minister is also planning to make a major speech this week calling for more help for people suffering from mental illness.

Mr Clegg has previously described the UK's drugs laws as 'utterly senseless' because throwing users in jail only hooked them on harder drugs or turned them into professional criminals.

But his party has previously stopped short of making a manifesto promise to decriminalise. Sir Richard, a long-standing campaigner for drugs liberalisation, wrote an internet blog last Thursday where he said he was 'delighted' by recent moves to relax the law in Alaska and Jamaica.

'The new Alaskan law now allows adults to legally consume and grow marijuana for non-medical purposes,' Sir Richard wrote. 

'In Jamaica, lawmakers passed an act to decriminalise small amounts of cannabis and establish a licensing agency to regulate a lawful medical cannabis industry on the island. These are important developments and great examples of sensible drug policy.'

Chatham House said: 'Richard Branson and Nick Clegg will discuss how the current approach to tackling the international drugs trade is failing... Many countries are approaching societal drug use and addiction as a public health issue rather than one of criminality'.

Tory MP Charles Walker said of the Lib Dem plan: 'This is completely and utterly irresponsible. And I speak as someone who has met the devastated parents of the young victims. 

Celebrities and politicians are basing policy on their own youthful experiences. But the drugs are seven or eight times more powerful now. I admire Nick Clegg for his work on mental health but he cannot have a foot in both camps.'

A spokesman for Mr Clegg said: 'The current system isn't working. We should be treating possession of drugs as a health issue to help addicts deal with their problems.

'Skunk has recently been shown to have a negative impact on many users' mental health, which is why it's so important that users are given treatment, rather than just being constantly recycled through the criminal justice system.'
