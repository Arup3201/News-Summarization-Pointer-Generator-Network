A bureau de change boss who recruited his wife and son to help clean up nearly £170 million-worth of criminal cash has been jailed for nine years.

Ussama El-Kurd, 64, known as 'Sammy the Kurd' in underworld circles, was on bail pending an appeal for a previous money laundering conviction when he set up the business in 2006.

He enlisted his wife Randa, 51, and son Husain, 22, to help run the Kensington Money Exchange in upmarket Notting Hill, west London.

Ussama El-Kurd, known as 'Sammy the Kurd', was on bail for a previous money laundering conviction when he set up the business in 2006

Their efforts allowed the proceeds of drug dealing, violent robberies and other major crimes to be spent freely by offenders.

The Palestinian-born family ran their 'bespoke money laundering service' in Kensington Church Street.

No records of the dodgy transactions were kept, but authorities say the business must have helped to wash at least £169m until it was shut down in 2010.

They estimate just one-sixth of the trade carried out at the store was legitimate.

Ussama El-Kurd wept as he was led away to the cells to begin a nine-year jail term after a judge told him he had caused 'harm on a truly major scale.'

Mr Justice Irwin told him: 'That volume of money laundering represented the proceeds of no doubt drug dealing, no doubt extortion, no doubt robbery and violence and all the other aspects of major crime.

'You began this offending while on bail for an appeal and then facing a potential retrial for your previous offending.

'You defied the courts when you began this offence.'

He was found guilty of a near-identical offence in 1999 and jailed for 14 years - though the conviction was later quashed on appeal.

The new venture was set up following his release in April 2006.

El-Kurd's wife Randa was jailed for ten months for turning a 'blind eye' to his deception while listed as a director of the firm.

She claimed she had not attended court during the earlier trial and had tried to shield her family from publicity.

But the court heard she was well-versed in the business world, having set up her own property firm in west London.

The judge said he accepted she had played no part in the money laundering itself, but added: 'You turned a deliberate blind eye to what your husband was doing.

'He may have told you he was carrying on business legitimately but you didn't check.'

Brunel University student Husain El-Kurd was recruited to work as a delivery driver and man the store while his parents were on holiday.

He pleaded to be spared jail so he could continue his studies in international management.

But he also received a ten-month jail term and was told he had played an 'active role' in the enterprise.

He and his mother embraced in the dock as their sentences were read out.

Ussama El-Kurd was banned from acting as a company director for ten years, his wife for five years and his son for three years.

Annie Conway, specialist prosecutor for the CPS organised crime Division, said: 'Ussama El-Kurd was laundering criminals' money on a truly industrial scale.

'He made a considerable living cleaning dirty money and helping organised criminals go undetected.

'With the help of his wife and son, El Kurd ran what appeared to be an inconspicuous money exchange shop on Kensington Church Street.

The shop was a magnet for criminals who changed up to £150million in Euros before spiriting it away

'But the shop was a magnet for criminals who changed up to £150 million into Euros before spiriting it away.

'Today's sentencing stops not just these three criminals, but all those who relied on the El-Kurds to enjoy a criminal lifestyle.'

Brendan Foreman, SOCA Regional Head of Investigations, said: 'This was no legitimate business venture, it was simply an enterprise designed to enable criminals to prosper while living lives of luxury in foreign jurisdictions both near and far.

'El Kurd has personally profited and the considerable assets he managed to accrue will now be pursued through the courts.

'This investigation will have had a significant impact on organised crime groups operating in the UK and overseas.

'Many have had their criminal proceeds seized whilst others have been denied access to a money laundering mechanism that operated under the guise of a legitimate business on a UK high street.'

Usamma El-Kurd, of Lynwood Road, Ealing, west London, admitted conspiracy to conceal, disguise, convert, transfer or remove criminal property from the UK.

His son, of the same address, admitted failing to disclose suspicious transactions.

Randa El-Kurd admitted neglecting her role as a company director, contrary to the 2007 Money Laundering Regulations.
