Allegations: Acclaimed artist Graham Ovenden, 70, is accused of abusing children who posed as models for him in the 1970s and '80s, a court heard

A famous artist 
sexually abused young girls after blindfolding them and dressing them in
 Victorian-style nighties, a jury heard today.

Graham Ovenden, 70, is accused of offences against four children aged from six to 14 who posed for him between 1972 and 1985.

Ovenden's work includes nude and semi-nude portraits of young girls.

Ramsay
 Quaife, prosecuting, said the offences took place at his homes 
in London and Cornwall and the alleged victims - all now adults - had 
similar accounts of the alleged abuse.

He
 added that the accused told police he still has ‘a very major 
reputation’ for painting some of the best portraits of children in the 
last 200 years.

Mr Quaife told
 Truro Crown Court in Cornwall that the offences took place as the 
youngsters modelled for Ovenden, who is also a renowned fine art 
photographer.

He said: 'What 
we say is that Mr Ovenden is a paedophile, that is a sexual abuser of 
children, and we say in this case the target of his abuse was young 
girls.'

He described how 
Ovenden would dress the children up in Victorian style nighties before 
leaving them naked and blindfolded.

He said of one alleged victim: 'The 
defendant would put the tape down over her eyes. She could not see 
anything. The tape was black, stretchy and smelt of glue.

'Although she could not see, she could hear the defendant and she could remember the sound of his belt buckle.'

Mr. Quaife added that Ovenden was actually performing an indecent assault on the children.

He
 said in some cases the naked girls whose eyes were taped were moved 
into different positions and pictured where their genitals could be 
seen.

Ovenden, from Pantersbridge, near Bodmin, Cornwall, denies six charges of indecent assault and three of indecency with a child.

The trial continues.
