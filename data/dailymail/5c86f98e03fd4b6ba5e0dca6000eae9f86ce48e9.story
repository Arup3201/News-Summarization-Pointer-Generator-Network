Mr Jusa says he researched the insects in the photographs on the internet

'In order to capture these colourful insects so close up I was just three centimetres away.'

He added: 'All of the macro photographs were taken in my simple mini studio at my work.

'I was lucky to find all of these unique insects in the forest where I work.

'But I only knew a few insects before I got involved in macro photography.

'I have set myself a goal to learn more about other species of insects that exist on this planet.
