The school photograph is meant to be a cherished memento which lets families remember their child's formative years.

But when this class of second grade elementary school students in Florida look at their class picture, they are unlikely to enjoy the memories quite so much.

Their group picture became an 'offensive and degrading' photograph when one of the pupil's heads was bizarrely replaced with a brown cartoon face.

Badly taken: The second grade class photo from Sawgrass Elementary (other pupils obscured) shows a boy on the front row whose identity is covered by a bizarre brown smiley face

The unidentified pupil at Sawgrass Elementary School in Broward County, Florida, was subjected to the 'humiliating' Photoshop treatment instead of being removed from the picture.

Photographer David Claussen's company Broward County Pictures were commissioned to take the school picture, but were told shortly after by the local PTA that two children had to be removed from the image as their parents had not signed a consent form.

Mr Claussen told Florida's Local 10 News that he was able to remove one child completely from the picture, but could not do so with the other student as he was sat on the front row.

The Parent Teacher's Association instead amazingly advised him to obscure the child's identity by placing a brown 'smiley face' over his head.

Officials at Sawgrass Elementary's PTA would not confirm who was to blame for the photographic blunder

The resulting image has been branded 'offensive' and 'degrading', with one parent at the school telling Local 10 the boy would have felt 'humiliated' by the picture.

School officials would not confirm whether the pupil still attended Sawgrass Elementary.

A
district spokeswoman in Broward County told Local 10 the picture was an
'oversight', but would not confirm who was to blame for the image.

Claussen
and school officials said incidents do occasionally occur when children
have to be removed from pictures after they are taken when it 
transpires their parents have not signed consent forms.

Mr
Claussen, who has taken school pictures for 37 years, said despite the 
bizarre alteration to the image, he received 14 orders for the photo.

The class photo will be retaken and parents given free copies if they ordered the first attempt.

The
PTA for Sawgrass Elementary said in a statement: 'The PTA notified 
photographer after finding out that a child didn't have a signed media 
release form from the parent.

Broward Schools Photography covered 
the child's face using an inappropriate sticker. The PTA disagrees with 
how the photography company handled it and worked with the photographer 
to have the picture retaken this Thursday.

Immediate action was taken on behalf of the PTA. We love and protect our children.'
