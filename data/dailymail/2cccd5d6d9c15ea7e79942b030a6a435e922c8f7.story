Fallen AFL star Ben Cousins has been taken into police custody for the third time in two weeks. 

He is currently in the emergency department of Armadale Hospital awaiting a mental health assessment and remains in a stable condition.

Cousins was reportedly arrested after driving erratically and was caught breaking into a Sikh temple to compulsively take photos before climbing onto the roof of another home in Canning Vale in Perth's south, according to Fairfax Media.

The 36-year-old footballer allegedly upset Sikh priest, Jasvinder Singh and his wife when he reversed his car over the garden of the temple ground and parked in Mr Singh's personal car park.

The priest tried to confront Cousins before he took off again and stopped a few metres ahead to take photos of the temple.

'Again, I tried to talk to him and he started his car,' Mr Singh said. 

'I called the police and then I followed him again and he stopped his car in the middle of the road and then some cars almost hit him.'

Mr Singh then became alarmed by the behaviour and left it to the police.

'He was not looking stable.' 

Before they arrived however, Cousins had moved onto another person's house and opened the door before realising Mr and Mrs. Singh were still watching him from their yard.

He allegedly jumped fences and scaled a two-story home and paced along the roof.

The police arrived ten minutes later and talked Cousins off the room before arresting him in Shreeve Road at 11am.

CCTV has shown Cousins attempting to flee from police. 

'I was pretty panicked - I locked the doors and we stayed inside in one of the bedrooms until I could get confirmation from police that it (the arrest) was done,' Witness Jenny Wilson told Network Ten. 

Ben Cousins, in 2007, after he was charged with drug possession and refusing a drug test

Cousins, who returned to the AFL with Richmond after the league banned him for one year, saw the latter stages of his career overshadowed by controversy

On March 16 Cousins, who has a history of serious drug abuse, was assessed at a mental health facility after he was caught behind the secure fences of an SAS base.

The premiership star and former West Coast Eagles captain was apprehended at the Campbell Barracks near Perth at 11pm, according to Nine News.

He was later assessed in the mental health ward at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital where he was reportedly being held under 'mental health watch'.

The 36-year-old was moved out of the hospital on the afternoon of March 16 but doctors remain concerned about his mental health, Seven News reports.

Cousins was arrested the week prior for allegedly driving erratically and not stopping when requested by police.

He is scheduled to face the Fremantle Magistrates Court on April 8. 

Cousins retired from the sport in 2010. He appeared in court in 2012 after being charged with drug possession

The Brownlow Medalist's off-field antics have created headlines for almost a decade, due to well-publicised troubles with drugs and criminal connections. 

In 2005, Cousins and teammate Michael Gardiner became embroiled in police investigation into a nightclub shooting. The following year he was charged after abandoning his car and running away from police to avoid a booze bus.

He entered rehab for 'substance abuse' in 2007, being later being suspended by the AFL for bringing the game into disrepute. 

Cousins returned to the game with Richmond in 2009, before he retired at the end of the 2010 season. 

In 2012, the then-retired star was charged with possession of methylamphetamine with intent to sell or supply by police located near a drug rehabilitation centre he was attending.
