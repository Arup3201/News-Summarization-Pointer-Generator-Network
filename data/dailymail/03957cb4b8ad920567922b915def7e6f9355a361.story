New mother Chelsea Clinton took a night off from her parenting duties on Wednesday night in order to attend a dinner hosted by film production company Relativity Studios. 

The 34-year-old, who gave birth to her daughter Charlotte on September 26, attended the event without her husband of four years Marc Mezvinsky, no doubt leaving him at home to care for their four-month-old baby girl. 

Chelsea was joined at the dinner, which was held in celebration of the studio's upcoming release Black or White, by a group of Hollywood heavyweights including Kevin Costner, Octavia Spencer and Anthony Mackie, all of whom star in the big screen drama.

The former NBC presenter showcased an incredibly trim and toned physique, having clearly shed any and all of the weight that she put on during her pregnancy. 

Wearing a bright blue dress and smart black jacket, she added a pair of thick black tights, no doubt to guard against the sub-zero New York temperatures.

Chelsea appeared fresh-faced and bright-eyed as she chatted with the Black or White cast, showing no signs that she might be suffering through the sleepless nights that so many mothers seem to struggle with during the first few months of parenthood.

The mother-of-one has made no secret of her interest in the film industry in the past; in April, a documentary that she executive produced was premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival, where it received an overly positive reception from critics.

The short film, entitled Of Many, explored the relationship between the extraordinary friendship between two religious leaders - one Muslim, one Jewish.

The event marks one of the first times that Chelsea has stepped out without her daughter since the birth; the day after Christmas, the mother-of-one and her husband were joined by her parents, Former President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary, for a casual stroll along Fifth Avenue.

Other than however, Chelsea has spent much of her time behind closed doors, no doubt relishing the first few months of parenthood alongside husband Marc.

Since the birth, Charlotte has been growing up in the family's $10million apartment in the nearby Flatiron District. 

The couple bought the home in the beautiful Whitman Building, near Madison Square Park, a year ago - relocating from their last $4million apartment just a block away.
