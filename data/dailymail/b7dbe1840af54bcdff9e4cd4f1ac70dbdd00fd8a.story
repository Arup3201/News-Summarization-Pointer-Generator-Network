A multimillionaire pharmaceuticals entrepreneur who fatally poisoned her eight-year-old autistic son in their luxury Manhattan hotel room has said her only regret is not taking her own life as well.

Gigi Jordan, 53, spoke to Dr. Phil in an exclusive interview from Rikers Island, New York, where she is jailed while on trial for the killing of her son Jude Mirra in 2010.

In the interview, which will air in full on Friday, Dr. Phil asked her if she has any regrets and she said simply: 'I would have done a better job of ending my own life.'

Jordan stands accused of force-feeding her son a deadly cocktail of pills in February as they stayed the Peninsula on Fifth Avenue. She then made an unsuccessful attempt to take her own life.

Denial: In an interview with Dr Phil (pictured), Gigi Jordan said she killed her eight-year-old son in 2010 because she felt 'incapable of protecting him'. She has said she feared her ex-husband was going to kill her

She has since claimed that she feared that her ex-husband would kill her after she learned he'd allegedly stolen millions from her. She feared that, if she was murdered, her son would be taken in by his father, whom she accused of molesting the boy.

As a result, death seemed to be the only option, she told Dr Phil.

'To run would only make me more vulnerable,' she said. 'I felt completely incapable of protecting him. Whether that was rational or not, I can't say, but I don't think I'm a cold blooded murderer.' 

Dr Phil asked: 'Who gave you the right to end this child's life?'

'I wanted him to be safe,' she responded. 'I didn't want him to be tortured anymore.' 

Straight talking: When Dr Phil asked Jordan if she regretted anything, she said not taking her own life

Jude was found dead of a drug overdose in a pill-strewn Manhattan hotel room in  2010. Jordan, who had also taken pills, was found on the floor nearby. She claims she tried to revive her son.

Prosecutors claim she climbed on top of her son and pried his mouth open - so forcefully that she left bruises on his face and chest - and plunged a deadly combination of painkillers, other drugs, vodka and orange juice down his throat with a syringe. 

Then she got on her computer and transferred money out of her son's trust fund, they said. She also wrote a suicide note.

She has denied forcing the drugs down his throat and said the bruises reflect her effort to revive him.

Johnson has said that she set out to take her life and her son's for a complex set of reasons:

She claims some ominous occurrences had convinced her that one of her ex-husbands would have her killed and she felt that without her Jude would be unable to avoid a man she says sexually abused him.

Both men have denied her allegations. Neither has been charged with any crime.  

Even though the second grader was unable to speak, Jordan has claimed it was her son who suggested they took their lives - by typing messages on her phone. 

She claims he  urged her to use 'a lot of drugs' so he would die peacefully.

'I wish you do it soon,' she claims he wrote. 'I'm scare u r too chicken.'  

The nonverbal, often tormented-seeming Jude was initially deemed autistic but later was diagnosed with immune-system abnormalities, post-traumatic stress disorder and other problems, she said.

Nonetheless, she says, Jude disclosed the abuse to her with gestures, his few words and, later, by typing on computers in a technique known as facilitated communication, with her touching his arm.

Various authorities rebuffed her requests to investigate the abuse allegation, she said.

One of her inquiries instead ended with her hospitalized for a psychological examination in 2008. She was released within days. 

Jordan faces between five and 25 years in prison if she is found guilty of manslaughter and could get 25 years to life behind bars if she is convicted of murder.
