Frank Lampard has told England’s youngsters to listen, learn and have no fear as they edge closer to the World Cup finals.

Roy Hodgson is set to confirm an inexperienced team for Wednesday’s friendly against Ecuador in Miami. It will be led by Lampard, aged 35, winning his 104th cap and oozing maturity in these situations.

'My message to the younger players will be to enjoy the game, to play without fear, listen to the manager and do what he wants to do because we have done a lot of preparation,' said Lampard.

Chance to impress: Lampard will start against Ecuador as he looks to show he can play a key role for England

The World Cup starts next week and England’s first game is against Italy in Manaus on Saturday week.

'When we were playing against Peru a few days ago, we were thinking about Italy,' Lampard added. 'We were thinking about Brazil and what we are going to do out there.

'So they have to take that on board, but, more than that, they have to enjoy it and play the way they’ve played to get themselves into the squad. We have all watched them play and we have all been excited by them. So carry on doing that.'

Lampard still rates his first major tournament, under Sven Goran Eriksson at Euro 2004, as his best in terms of personal form. Since then he has endured disappointment at the World Cup in 2006 and 2010, and he missed Euro 2012 through injury.

'I made my debut, played one game and then missed a lot,' said Lampard. 'I came into Sven’s squad pre-2004 having hardly played.

'People didn’t expect me to play but I found myself in the team and probably had my best tournament. So that was out of the blue. People can make it like that. Sometimes a late run can be the perfect one.'
