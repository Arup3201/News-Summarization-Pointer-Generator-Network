Violent: Steven Davis, 34, was jailed for 15 years for slashing his best friend with a kitchen knife

A heavy drinker has been jailed for 15 years for slashing his best friend’s throat after asking him to stand up and show him how tall he was.

Steven Davis, 34, had spent a night drinking with Patrick Bentley at a flat in Preston, Lancashire, when he slashed his neck from behind with a kitchen knife.

Despite stabbing his friend twice more in the torso as he tried to flee, a court ruled Davis - who had 114 previous convictions, four for violence - was not dangerous enough to receive a life sentence.

Jeremy Grout-Smith, prosecuting, told Preston Crown Court the attack began when Davis asked his friend to stand up to see how tall he was.

Without warning, he came up behind him and deliberately slashed his throat.

When the victim tried to get out of the flat by the front door, he was stabbed twice by the defendant in the abdomen.

A doctor who treated Mr Bentley said the neck wound only just missed slicing into a number of major blood vessels.

Mr Bentley had been left 'very anxious and nervous around people, even close friends'.

The court heard Davis, from Preston, had a life made 'chaotic' by alcohol abuse and had appeared in court 72 times, mostly for drunken behaviour.

He denied trying to kill his friend - claiming he could not explain why he launched the attack - but was found guilty of attempted murder.

Four of his previous convictions involved violence against a person but none of them had serious consequences, the court heard.

Sharon Watson, defending, said: 'He is very sorry he has hurt his friend.

'Alcohol was involved and it is plain to see that at 34 it is the chronic long-term abuse of alcohol which has wrecked his life so far.

'He simply doesn’t know that motivated him to do what he did and that extreme act of violence was completely out of character.'

Recorder Anthony Russell QC told Davis: 'This was a spontaneous attempt to kill, without any provocation.

'Fortunately, others came to Mr Bentley’s aid and as a result of their actions and that of paramedics he was able to survive.

'He was fortunate because if [the throat wound] had been any deeper it would have led to catastrophic bleeding and almost certainly death.

Cut: Images released by Lancashire Police showed the cut to the victim's throat was several inches long

Sentence: Preston Crown Court jailed Davis for 15 years but ruled he was not dangerous enough to receive a life sentence. He had 114 previous convictions, though only four were for violence against a person

'I have considered whether I should impose a life sentence, but I have come to the conclusion that you don’t fit the criteria of dangerousness as defined by Parliament.'

DC Mike Riley, of Lancashire Police, said: 'I am pleased with the sentence passed which reflects the seriousness of this unprovoked attack.

'The victim is very lucky to have survived. Fortunately such cases are rare but I hope it sends a message that such cases are treated exceptionally seriously by the police and the courts.'
