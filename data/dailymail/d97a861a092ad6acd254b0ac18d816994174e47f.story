A former Rutgers University student who was convicted 
of bias for using a webcam to see his roommate and another man kissing 
was released from jail Tuesday after serving 20 days of a 30-day 
sentence.

Dharun Ravi, 20, reported to the Middlesex County jail on May 31, though he could have remained free while his case is appealed.

His lawyer, Steven Altman, picked him up around 8:30 a.m. Ravi, who was clean-shaven when he entered jail, had a beard when he left.

Leaving jail: A bearded Dharun Ravi, right, convicted of a hate crime for using a webcam to spy on his roommate's gay tryst, leaves Middlesex County jail after completing 20 days of his 30-day sentence. His lawyer, Steven Altman, left, picked him up around 8:30 am

He did not stop to speak with the media before he rode off in Altman's car.

A judge sentenced him to 30 days in jail — far less than the 10-year prison sentence
he could have given him.

He still faces three years of probation, plus 
more than $11,000 in fines and assessments, 300 hours of community 
service, and counseling.

Like other county jail inmates, Ravi automatically was given five days off for good behavior and five for working.

Federal
immigration authorities said Monday that Ravi will not be deported to 
his native India. He lived there until he was 5 years old and remains a 
citizen, though he is in the United States legally.

Foreign 
citizens convicted of crimes here can face deportation — usually after 
they complete their prison or jail terms. Last year, Ravi rejected a 
plea deal under which prosecutors would have sought to protect him from 
being deported.

Ravi's supporters argued for leniency in part to 
make it less likely that he would be deported. Experts say the 
proceedings are usually initiated against those who are incarcerated for
a year or more.

Ravi was convicted in March of 15 criminal 
charges, including bias intimidation, invasion of privacy and tampering 
with a witness.

Testifying: During the trial, Rutgers student Lokesh Ojha described how he helped Ravi position his webcam so it was pointed directly at Clementi's bed

Jurors heard during a trial that lasted three 
weeks that he used a friend's computer in September 2010 to view a few 
seconds of live streaming video from his own dorm-room webcam and saw 
roommate Tyler Clementi and another man kissing.

He told others 
about it in person, in texts, instant messages and tweets — and alerted 
others again two days later that Clementi, 18, wanted the room to 
himself again. That time, the camera did not operate.

A night 
later, Clementi committed suicide. His story has been held up since then
as a prime example of what can go wrong when young gays are bullied, 
though Ravi was not charged with the death.

Prosecutors are 
appealing the sentence, arguing that Ravi should have to serve more time
for his actions. Ravi is appealing the conviction, saying he is not 
guilty.

Ravi's lawyer has said he'll start paying off the fines and begin working on the community service part of his sentence.

His time in jail was nearly as long as his time as a Rutgers student.

Tragic: Tyler Clementi committed suicide in September 2010, days after Ravi used a webcam to see live streaming video of Clementi and another man kissing

Two days before going to jail Ravi issued an apology: 'I accept responsibility for and regret my thoughtless, insensitive, immature, studpid and childish choices that I made on September 19, 2010 and September 21, 2010.

'My behavior and action, which at no time were motivated by hate, bigotry, prejudice or desire to hurt, humiliate or embarrass anyone, were nonetheless the wrong choices and decisions.'

Clementi's parents dismissed the apology as a 'public relations piece' put together by Ravi's lawyers.

Clementi is seen as an example of 
what can happen to young gays who are too often bullied even as 
acceptance of gays has increased.

After
the suicide, gay-rights and anti-bullying activists held him up as an 
example of the horrible consequences of bullying young gays.
