Kate and William will be among relatives when they arrive in Australia on April 16 – after two suburban families discovered they had Royal blood.

In the bayside area of Birkdale in Brisbane lives British-born mine worker Mark Lowers, 46, who is Kate’s second cousin.

He said yesterday: ‘I’d love to have them over, throw a few snags [sausages] on the barbie and crack a few cold ones but I don’t think they’re going to have time!’

L-R: Tia, Mark and Shae Lowers have invited the Cambridges to their house for a barbeque after finding out that Kate is Mark's second cousin. They say the royal connection explains why their daughter is such a 'princess'

He investigated his family tree in 2008. ‘I found out that my mum Lillian, and Kate’s mum Carole, had the same grandmother, Edith Eliza Chandler,’ he said.

‘That makes them first cousins and makes Kate and me second. I guess the little fella George is a third cousin of some sort.

‘Carole and Mum wrote Christmas cards to each other for years then lost touch.’

Mark’s wife Tia believes their nine-year-old daughter Shae is shaping up to become quite the little princess. Shae said: ‘I’ve always known I have a bit of royal in me – I’m a big tea drinker, and love cucumber sandwiches.’

Just up the road lives plumber Neil Geary, 74. He is William’s 14th  cousin – and has asked the Governor of Queensland for an invitation to a VIP Royal luncheon planned for April 19.

Neil said: ‘So far no invitation has arrived but I understand the pressure of having to invite all the rellies.’

Kate will be touring Australia - along with William and George - on an 18-day trip starting tomorrow

His wife Barbara traced Neil’s lineage back to 1749 and found that he and William both descend from the children of William Conyngsby and Beatrix Thursby.

Neil said: ‘Trust me, no one is more shocked than I am. I wrote to the Palace back in 2009 and was chuffed when we got the letter saying that William was very pleased to hear about his Australian relations.

‘I’m very proud to know that William and Harry are family.’
