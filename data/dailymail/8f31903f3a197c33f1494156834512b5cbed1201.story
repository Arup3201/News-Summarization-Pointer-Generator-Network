The Duchess of Cornwall is to give some comfort to victims of rape and sexual assault by distributing hundreds of wash bags filled with toiletries.

Camilla came up with the idea after meeting victims in Derbyshire and discussing what would make them feel ‘more human’ after going through such a traumatic ordeal and subsequent forensic examinations.

Staff at her private office at Clarence House are making up 750 bags using donations of shampoo and body wash from companies including Marks & Spencer, Champneys, 2 True and Trevor Sorbie.

New initiative: The Duchess of Cornwall, pictured at Clarence House, has launched a new scheme to distribute wash bags filled with donated toiletries to the victims of rape and sexual abuse

They will be distributed through The 
Havens – centres for people who have been raped or sexually assaulted – 
on a two-year trial basis, although there are hopes to expand the 
initiative.

The Duchess told the Mail yesterday that she had been deeply moved by the stories of the women she had met.

‘When you are ill, the first thing 
that you want to do is wash your hair and clean your teeth. The same 
applies here,’ she said.

‘It is a small something to make women and girls who go through such a terrible ordeal feel just a little bit human again.

‘We are starting in a small way but I
hope that we will be able  to expand the scheme. It won’t change what 
has happened but might offer a small crumb of comfort at what is a very 
difficult time.’

Camilla was speaking at a reception at
Clarence House. Among the 85 guests were Home Secretary Theresa May, 
Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer, police and representatives
from victims’ groups.

Mia James, 29, who was gang-raped at 
the age of 16, said she welcomed the Duchess’s involvement. ‘It’s a 
small thing but there is a feeling, after you have gone through 
something like that, of wanting to get every trace of it off you,’ she 
said.

‘I think this is a great initiative. We need somebody high profile to raise awareness.’

Helping hand: The Duchess of Cornwall and the Baroness Scotland of Asthal discuss the new project to help rape victims 'feel human again'

Making a difference: The Duchess of Cornwall, pictured talking to Kier Starmer QC and Director of public prosecutions, came up with the idea after speaking to rape victims

Miss James, from south-east London, said no one was ever brought to justice for attacking her.

Jo Delaforce, matron at The Haven in 
Camberwell, south-east London, one of the three centres involved in the 
project, added: ‘It will make a big difference. It won’t take away what 
has happened to them [the victims], but it gives them a bit of TLC.’

Camilla, who has visited nine rape 
crisis and sexual assault referral centres in the UK since 2009, spoke 
of the importance of forming a ‘united front to help victims of rape and
sexual abuse’.

‘Over the past few years, I have seen 
for myself some of the remarkable work being undertaken by 
representatives of rape crisis organisations, the National Health 
Service and the police across the country... who provide a lifeline to 
the women, the children and the men, who have been left shamed and 
traumatised through no fault of their own,’ she said.

‘Perhaps, from this small beginning, 
we will be able to build a future where society will simply not tolerate
rape and sexual abuse any longer.’

Trial: Home Secretary Teresa May, right, also attended the reception where The Duchess launched the scheme which will be distributed in London in a two year trial before possibly being rolled-out nationwide
