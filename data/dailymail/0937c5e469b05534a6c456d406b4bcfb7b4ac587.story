Film 'star': Marilyn Mantle, 64, was approached in a charity shop to play the role of a corpse alongside A-list actors

A retired woman was handed a part in a Hollywood film alongside A-list stars - playing a drowned corpse.

Marilyn Mantle, 64, was in a charity shop in Portmadoc, Wales, when a man approached her and told her she would be perfect for the role.

Her enthusiasm was not dampened when she discovered she would be playing a dead body washed up in a rock pool.

She played the corpse in Retreat alongside Mission Impossible II's Cillian Murphy, actress Thandie Newton and Billy Elliott's Jamie Bell.

A few days after being approached, the retired civil servant was taken to lunch by film director Carl Tibbetts.

Ms Mantle said: 'I wasn't sure how to react to being told you would make an ideal dead body.

'It was all very surreal - and I have to admit assumed the whole thing was a practical joke.

'But
I went with it and had the most amazing time. I've not seen the film 
yet, but it will be interesting to see what it looks like.

'I
suspect my role will largely be a "blink and you'll miss it" moment but
it's not every day this happens so you've just got to go with it when 
these opportunities come along.

'My role largely involved lying completely still and half-submerged in a rock pool while I was covered in a plastic sheet.'

The scene was filmed on Tudweiliog beach, north-west Wales in October last year.

Although not the most glamourous of roles, Marilyn was whisked away for a shopping spree with the film's designer, who has worked with top stars like Kylie Minogue.

Before filming, Marilyn even shared Thandie Newton's trailer, where she was given a pre-performance hair and make-up session.

The tense thriller sees Cillian Murphy and Thandie Newton play a couple making a return to a secluded island to heal emotional wounds.

Their CB radio, which is their only means of contacting the mainland goes dead, and then they encounter a sinister stranger played by Jamie Bell, who has a terrifying story to tell.

The film was released in British cinemas last week and is available on DVD today.

Marilyn, who lives alone in north Wales, added: 'It was filmed in this little cove which was just covered with film crew.

'That's when I realised I had to get it right. It was not quite a joke like I thought it was.

'It's so hard to lie completely still when you have to. Every muscle in my body wanted to twitch and wriggle.'

Marilyn admits she had never heard of the A-list Hollywood actors before her filming experience.

Her only instructions were to lie completely still, covered from her hips down in tarpaulin, in a rock pool of water.

But she was thrilled to find out her on-screen husband was Jimmy Yuill, who played Doug Kersey in the British television show Wycliffe.

It was her near-perfect match with Jimmy Yuill which she believes got her the part.

She said: 'When you saw us together, we looked like a married couple. Well that's what I thought anyway.

'And I think they picked me because I look a bit like a fisherman's wife.

'I was a bit on the plump side, my height was right and also my colouring. I was what they had in mind.'
