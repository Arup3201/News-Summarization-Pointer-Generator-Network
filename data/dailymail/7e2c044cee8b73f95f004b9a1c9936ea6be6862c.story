She's famous for her love of high-end labels and expensive handbags but Denmark's Crown Princess Mary proved that budget fashion can be just as stylish during a visit to Copenhagen Fashion Week.

The Australian-born royal was resplendent in a cut-price £50 patterned silk dress as she met designers at The Jewellery Room, a showcase for Danish jewellers.

Speaking to Danish tabloid Billed Bladet as she arrived, the 42-year-old revealed that she was 'looking forward to seeing it all'.

Glamorous: Crown Princess Mary made her second appearance at Copenhagen Fashion Week today

The Jewellery Room brings together 16 up-and-coming and established jewellers, most of whom are Danish, among them Pandora and Ole Lynggaard.

Mary herself was wearing some impressive jewels, although they cost considerably more than her Edith and Ella dress, which is currently on sale with 70 per cent off.

Among them was a gold-plated Ole Lynggaard necklace, which, according to Royalista.com, sells for a majestic 41,000 Danish Krone (£4,145).

She also wore a £2,670 'leaves' ring by the same designer in 18k yellow gold which also comes in rose gold and cut-price silver versions, with the latter costing a relatively inexpensive £320. 

Afterwards, she continued on to the Designers' Nest showcase, where she met young designers, among them the Royal Academy's School of Design in Copenhagen.

Today's appearance at The Jewellery Room was her second visit to Copenhagen Fashion Week this month, although the first, at the Mark Kenly Domino Tan show on Wednesday, took the Danish press by surprise.

Unusually, the Kongehuset, or Danish Royal Court, did not announce the visit in advance, leading to speculation that the appearance had been a last minute decision.

Once there, Mary, who was glamorous in a  coat by Baum und Pferdgarten that is yet to hit the shops, appeared to enjoy the show, looking especially interested in a plum coloured jumpsuit.

The mother-of-four has made a habit of attending Copenhagen Fashion Week and was, until recently, patron of the Copenhagen International Fashion Fair.

She does, however, remain patron of another Copenhagen Fashion Week initiative called Designers' Nest which gives a platform to fledgling fashion designers.
