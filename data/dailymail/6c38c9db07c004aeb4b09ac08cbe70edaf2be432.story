At a reputed £10,000 a day, this lawyer certainly doesn’t come cheap - and even the smallest victory in court still counts as a win for him.

So it was to Nick Freeman that £75,000-a-week England footballer Danny Welbeck turned when he faced a speeding charge.

And sure enough the 55-year-old lawyer, known as ‘Mr Loophole’ for his ability to get celebrities off driving charges, struck a victory for Welbeck - by having his speeding fine cut by £5.

The sum is what the star earns in 40 seconds.

Mr Freeman represented the Manchester United striker after he was caught doing 82 in a 50mph zone.

He had refused a fixed-penalty notice and decided to go to court.

There, Welbeck, 21, escaped a ban and was ordered to pay a fine of just £65 for the offence in the Northenden area of Manchester last November.

However the standard fine is £60, so Mr Freeman went back into court where the district judge admitted his error and reduced the penalty.

Welbeck, who recently signed a four-year contract at Old Trafford, was pulled over when an officer spotted him speeding in his Range Rover.

The policeman followed the striker, on the day after his 21st birthday, and recorded him travelling at speeds between 72 and 82mph.

Courts must consider disqualifying drivers caught doing more than 66 in a 50mph zone, but the striker decided to sign up Mr Freeman to help.

Welbeck was said to have declined to accept the offer of a fixed-penalty notice at the roadside and the case went before a district judge yesterday.

Mr Freeman told Manchester Magistrates’ Court that a recording taken by the officer’s car proved Welbeck was not told what he was being offered.

He said the striker thought he was 
getting a ‘producer’ document, which would have made him hand over his 
driving documents at a police station.

But Welbeck could not do this because his brother - who looks after administration - had lost the paper section of the licence, Mr Freeman said.

District Judge Jonathan Taaffe accepted his argument, fined Welbeck £65 and issued three points - almost the same penalty that was originally offered (with a £60 fine).

He then reduced the fine to £60 following Mr Freeman’s intervention, but Welbeck was also ordered to pay costs totalling £365.

Speaking on behalf of Welbeck, who is away on international duty with England, Mr Freeman said the player was sorry for his actions.

He told the court: ‘He (Welbeck) would like to express that he very much regrets his involvement in this incident.

'He would like to express that he very much regrets his involvement in this incident. He regards himself as a role model and believes that in practising what one preaches. He takes his responsibilities extremely seriously'

Lawyer Nick Freeman on Danny Welbeck

‘He regards himself as a role model and believes that in practising what one preaches. He takes his responsibilities extremely seriously.’

Mr Freeman is known as ‘Mr Loophole’ for exploiting holes in prosecution cases against many celebrities (see below).

His previous clients include Welbeck’s manager at Manchester United, Sir Alex Ferguson, and former Red Devils and England star David Beckham.

Welbeck, from Hale, Greater Manchester, is set to play tonight as England open their World Cup 2014 qualifying campaign in Chisinau, Moldova.

Sir Alex was last week in the headlines after banning the club's young stars from driving flashy sports cars from new sponsors Chevrolet.

It offered first-team players a choice of luxury cars, but the Scot decreed no player under the age of 23 should be allowed to order a sporty model.

Jimmy Carr
 Cleared of using a mobile phone while driving after Freeman argued that
 Carr had used the dictation setting of his iPhone to record a joke as 
he drove and that using the phone for such a purpose was not illegal 
under current law.

Jeremy Clarkson
 After being loaned a car by Alfa Romeo, the vehicle was caught doing 
82mph in a 50mph zone. Alfa Romeo sent the ticket to Clarkson, who was 
acquitted and awarded costs because the prosecution did not offer 
evidence as to who the driver was at the time of the offence.

Andrew Flintoff
 The former England cricket captain was caught on camera doing 87mph in a
 temporary 50mph zone. Freeman pointed out that the prosecution notice 
was sent two days later than the law allows and Flintoff was let off.

Ronnie O'Sullivan
 Freeman accused the magistrate of winking at a journalist. The 
magistrate replied: 'Why would I wink at anybody? Do you think I'm gay 
or something?' Freeman subsequently had the trial stopped. At the 
retrial, the court accepted the explanation that O'Sullivan was 'too 
depressed' to provide a urine sample.

Wayne Rooney
 The England striker was cleared of driving without insurance after 
Freeman said that a requested adjournment had not been granted and the 
hearing had been conducted in absentia.

Dwight Yorke
 The former Manchester United star acquitted when a Home Office-approved
 speed gun could not be shown to have been used under the correct 
conditions of approval.
