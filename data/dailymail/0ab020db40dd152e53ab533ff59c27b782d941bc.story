Clutching her two-year-old child to her chest, Selemawl Gimay struggles not to cry as she speaks of the last time she saw her husband.

He managed to get on board a lorry to England a year ago after undertaking the 5,000mile journey from Eritrea to Calais.

But his 25-year-old wife remains alone in the dangerous camp with their daughter Hani, unsure as to when she will get the chance to cross the Channel to be reunited with him.

She is one of many women travelling thousands of miles in the desperate quest to start a new in Britain.

Husbands and wives are separated and fathers are forced to leave their children behind with their mothers as they dice with death to board lorries to Britain.

Those who remain in the unsanitary camps that have no running water and are reliant on food and water handouts from aids charity live a life of misery.

Mrs Gimay told the Mail she was finding it hard to look after her baby in the camp but had no choice because she wants them to be together as a family. ‘I miss him so much,’ she said. ‘Life here is so awful and I cannot wait to see my husband again so we can start our life in England.’

It has already been a year since he made the crossing to Britain where he has now set up home in Birmingham and is in the process of applying for asylum.

But his wife, although optimistic, admits she does not know when she will ever get the chance to jump on board a lorry and evade detection with her toddler in tow.

She is one of just the women who live in squalid, unhygienic camps dotted around the tiny port town of Calais which are overwhelmingly populated by men.

While these women are happy to discuss their desperate plight, they will not show their faces in case it harms their applications for asylum when they reach Britain.

Those fleeing wartorn countries or persecution in their home countries are supposed to declare asylum in the first safe country they reach, which is usually Italy.

Instead, they are convinced that Britain is an ‘El Dorado’ that they must reach and so they wait until they reach England to claim asylum.

Most of the camp’s inhabitants tend to be the youngest and fittest men whose families pay people smugglers to get them from Libya to Italy and then up to France.

Once they make it to Britain, they claim asylum or begin working in the black market so that they can send money back to their parents and siblings.

But a handful of women make the crossing with the men and are forced to live in horrifically unsanitary conditions in camps where fighting is a regular occurrence.

Mrs Gimay, from the Eritrean capital Asmara, is one of the very few women who has made it to Calais with her baby in a bid to join her husband.

She has been living in the camp for three months and is already feeling the burden of having to look after her daughter on her own.

She paid $3,000 to people smugglers to get her to the camp and hopes to be reunited with her husband if she makes it aboard a lorry.

‘My husband went to the UK last year. He managed to get on the back of a lorry and get to England and he now lives in Birmingham,’ she said.

‘I miss him so much as I haven’t seen him for a year and our daughter has grown so much. I came to this camp so that I could get on a lorry to England but it is so hard with my daughter.

‘I want to study in England and maybe one day become a hairstylist when my family is reunited.

‘The conditions in the camp are so bad. It is so hard for me to live like this – especially with the baby – but we hope that one day we can reach England and have a good life.

Selemawl Gimay, who has brought her two-year-old daughter 5,000 miles from Eritrea to the camp in Calais, wants to take her on a lorry to England to join her husband.

Without water or basic sanitation, desperate women stick together in the camps to protect themselves against the threat of assault and potential rape

‘It’s very difficult for my daughter to grow up here.’

Mrs Gimay is not the only woman in the camp whose family has been torn apart in their desperate quest to reach the UK.

Demayd Tedros, 16, has been separated from her new husband for six years after he legally moved to the UK.

‘I married my husband last year in Ethiopia but we haven’t been able to live together because he has lived in Southampton for the past six years,’ she said.

‘I miss him very much. I want to be with him so I can have a baby and study English.’

She said she had boarded lorries at least 50 times only to be caught by sniffer dogs as the vehicles are searched on their way through the port.

Her family paid people smugglers $5,000 to get her from Eritrea to Ethiopia, then Sudan and up to Libya before undertaking the boat journey to Italy and then getting the train to Calais.

Her friend Hizbawit Haile, 24, from Asmara, Eritrea, said she had been at the camp for two months and was desperate to board a lorry to get to Britain.

‘Life here is not good. I just want to go to England,’ she said. ‘It is very cold and it is difficult to get food and water.

‘My auntie lives in London and I will go to live with her when I get across. I miss my mother and father so much – they still live in Eritrea – but I will send money to them from England.’

Another girl in the camp, Nura Saleh, 16, said life was hard in the Jungle 2 camp, which is mostly populated by Eritreans, as she cooked chicken on a rudimentary fire.

‘I want to go to England to study and become a clothes stylist,’ she said. ‘It is getting colder and life is difficult in this place. I hope to get on a lorry soon.’

It is a familiar refrain from a group of people so desperate to reach Britain, that they will endure horrific and unsanitary conditions for as long as it takes.

Another girl in the same camp, Natsnet Kfley, 17, said she was desperate to escape France for Britain.

‘It’s not good here. I’ve been here for three months and it is cold and horrible,’ she said.

‘I need to send back money to my family to help them. I will do any job – I can work in an office, no problem.’
