A four year war ripped through a group of chimpanzees in Tanzania in the early 1970s, fracturing the community

Chimpanzees are often photographed huddled in groups grooming each other and relaxing in trees, but they are also capable of usurping dominant males in vicious power struggles and waging wars that last for years.

A brutal four year war ripped through a group of chimpanzees in Gombe, Tanzania in the early 1970s, fracturing the community and leaving some members dead.

Now scientists have taken a fresh look at the chimp conflict, which was recorded by primatologist Jane Goodall to reveal similarities in how chimpanzee and human societies break down.

Dame Goodall witnessed the violent and sustained fighting of the apes first hand and called it a war. She had set up a feeding station at Gombe to try and unravel why the conflict escalated from what was a harmonious group.

Jospeh Feldblum of Duke University, North Carolina, has examined her field notes to build an in-depth model of the chimpanzee’s social network.

Dame Jane made incredibly detailed notes detailing which apes arrived at the feeding station at the same time and from which direction they travelled, New Scientist reported.

Previously, scientists had estimated the strength of relationships between the amount of time two chimps spent together, but now Dr Feldblum’s team has entered Dame Jane’s data collected between 1968 and 1972 into a model to track how the group’s relationship changed.

It suggests that the group was one happy family until 1971, until they divided into two groups.

While they are not completely sure what sparked the conflict, an alpha male known as Leakey died at the close of 1970.

Dr Feldblum told a meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists in Calgary, Canada: ‘As soon as Leakey died they started splitting. He seems to have been a bridge between the northern and southern chimps.

A younger chimp called Humphrey stepped into the power vacuum but he was challenged by two apes from the southern group called Hugh and Charlie.

The apes followed wither Humphrey or the southern brothers and a four year battle began, resulting in the deaths of seven males from the brother’s ‘rebel’ group.

While chimpanzees are known for their caring group dynamics, groups of Humphrey’s ‘army’ would sneak behind rebel lines, pick a target and beat him up.

Dr Feldblum discovered that it was possible to predict whether the chimp would support Humphrey or become a rebel and that the situation witnessed in the jungle resembles a power struggle in human society.

He thinks that groups of chimpanzees might explain how human-like societies evolve.

They have long been held as an almost human-like relative.

But researchers have discovered chimpanzees have almost the same personality traits as humans.

Georgia State University research shows some of those traits have a neurobiological basis, and that those traits vary according to the biological sex of the individual chimpanzee.

They found the most fundamental personality trait for chimpanzees is dominance – that is, whether an animal is a generally dominant and undercontrolled 'Alpha,' or a more playful and sociable 'Beta.'

But those two categories can be broken down statistically into smaller personality traits in ways that echo the personality structures researchers have found in child and adult human subjects.

Alpha personalities, for example, statistically break down into tendencies toward dominance and disinhibition.

Beta personalities, on the other hand, show low dominance and positive emotionality.Further analysis shows these lower order traits also can be statistically broken down into their constituent parts.The research team identified five personality factors that combine differently in each individual chimpanzee: conscientiousness, dominance, extraversion, agreeableness and intellect.
