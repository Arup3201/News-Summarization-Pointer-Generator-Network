These bizarre bikes are sure to get plenty of engines racing.

The incredible motorcycles are made from naked human models covered in bodypaint and contorted into amazing shapes.

Artist Trina Merry, from San Francisco, California,  has made a dirt bike, cruiser and sports bike out of her flexible subjects.

The surreal vehicles are now about to be used to front a high-profile U.S. motor show.

All of the speed queen models are athletes, and are made to pose in position for between five and six minutes over a period of up to 18 hours.

They are completely naked except for patches covering their modesty.

Ms Merry then slathers them with hypoallergenic paint, using brushes and spray-cans, partly before they pose and partly once in position.

She previously designed for films and TV in Hollywood, before taking a break to work all over the world creating bodyart.

'I suppose it started when I went to a 
rock concert working with an Australian band,' she said. 'They asked me to get on 
stage covered in body paint and I ended up doing it in front of 300 
people.

'I left Hollywood and started to paint bodies and exhibit in the San 
Francisco Bay area. Now I must have painted 100s of different people.

'I started initially painting your size 8 and size 6 fashion models but 
have gone to paint athletes because it's actually a real workout holding
the posing for 18 hours, six minutes in position and five minutes being
painted back and forth.

'I am a conceptual artist and often I am inspired by the bodies themselves by what they can and can't do.'

Ms Merry trained under renowned body painter Craig Tracy before becoming a master herself.

Wheels of fire: Ms Merry's aim was to take the stereotypical image of beautiful women posing with a motorbike and turn it on its head by making the bike from the bodies

Her latest work features the three types of motorbikes that will be touring the U.S. this year with the Progressive International Motorbike Show.

She said: 'Everyone has seen the pictures of scantily clad women next to motorbikes and cars and it can look a bit trashy.

'I wanted to take the idea of a beautiful woman and the motorbike and turn it on its head by making the bike from the bodies of the models.

'Nothing like this has ever been done before.'
