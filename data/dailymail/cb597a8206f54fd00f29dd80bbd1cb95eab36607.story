They have been the sites of bitter battles and inspired one of Britain’s most famous poets, and now some of Wales’ regal castles have been captured by drone.

Aerial perspectives show off the ruined castles' striking features and interesting layouts, which were built for battles and were then adapted over the centuries - sometimes for parties.

The Welsh government used the unmanned crafts to show off the country’s history from a unique perspective.

Complicated: The lake defences of Caerphilly Castle (pictured) have been described as 'the most elaborate water defences in all Britain' and it is one of the largest castles of its kind in Europe

Laugharne Castle, which inspired poet Dylan Thomas and Caerphilly, one of the largest castles in Europe, are two of the castles featured in the videos.

They are all examples of medieval fortifications and feature elaborate defences, such as Caerphilly’s network of moats and lakes to keep warring factions outside of its walls.

Caerphilly's lakes have been described as ‘the most elaborate water defences in all of Britain’. 

An inspiration: Dylan Thomas use to visit Laugharne Castle (pictured) to pen poems when he had writer's block and his granddaughter said it was the view from there that 'would have inspired him most'

St Davids Bishop’s Palace was built more with entertainment in mind as its great hall was designed by Bishop Henry de Gower to be the perfect backdrop for banquets.

And while millions of people visit the sites every year, very few will have been able to see the magnificent castles from above.

That is why Cadw, the Welsh Government’s historic environment service, took to the skies using drones to make the high resolution videos.

'We’re always looking at new and exciting ways to bring Wales’s history to life and these videos are a good way of showcasing our incredible heritage sites from a different angle,’ said John Griffiths, Minister for Culture and Sport.

‘More than two and a half million people visit Cadw sites every year but few people will ever have had the opportunity to see them like this.

‘Wales’s historic environment gives character to our communities and strengthens a sense of belonging and identity, and we hope that these innovative videos will inspire people to explore their local heritage sites this summer.’

The Welsh government used the unmanned crafts to record the four castles, shown on the map

Laugharne Castle: The medieval castle turned Tudor mansion was built in the 13th century.

Its grounds provided inspiration to both Dylan Thomas and Richard Hughes who put pen to paper in the castle’s garden summerhouse.

Built by the de Brian family, the castle didn’t fare too well during the Civil War and was partially dismantled by Parliamentary forces after a siege.

Kidwelly Castle: The earliest castle on this site was Norman and built around 1115 AD it was rebuilt in stone in the 13th century.

The aerial video shows how Kidwelly benefited from the latest thinking in castle design. It had a concentric design with one circuit of defensive walls set within another to allow the castle to be held even if the outer wall should fall.

The video shows a memorial to Princess Gwenllian just outside the Gatehouse. Gwenllian died in battle in 1136, fighting the lord of the castle, Maurice de Londres and is sometimes depicted rising a chariot or with a sword in her hand, a little like Boudicca.

St Davids Bishop’s Palace: The palace conveys the affluence and power of the medieval church when religion was the order of the day.

Bishop Thomas Bek undertook significant new building work on the site but it was Bishop Henry de Gower who was responsible for the palace that is captured by the drone.

The great hall - the most impressive chamber in the palace - was designed to be the perfect backdrop for banquets.

Caerphilly Castle: The medieval fortification in south wales was constructed by Gilbert de Clare in the 13th century.

It saw a lot of fighting between the nobleman and his descendants as well as other native Welsh rulers.

Its defences of lakes have been described as 'the most elaborate water defences in all Britain' and it is one of the largest castles of its kind in Europe.
