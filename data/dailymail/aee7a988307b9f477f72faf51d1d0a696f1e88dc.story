The legal team of a man arrested after kicking a stray cat 20ft through the air in a brutal online video has asked the judge to throw the case out - arguing there is no proof the animal was injured.

The horrific footage, which was shot in May and posted to Facebook, shows New Yorker Andre Robinson, 22, pet the trusting animal before punting it into some bushes outside a Brooklyn housing complex.

The man then laughs and a little dance. But Robinson, who reportedly has eight priors, was later arrested and charged with aggravated animal cruelty.

Brutal:  Robinson, uses his right foot to boot the cat into the bushes outside the Brooklyn apartment block

The motion to dismiss argues that prosecutors never claimed that the animal suffered any ill effects from the attack.

According to the New York Daily News, defence lawyer Risa Procton wrote: 'The accusatory instrument fails to allege any injury or pain experienced by the cat.'

Stephen Flamhaft, a defense lawyer who’s not involved in the case, says the motion will most likely be denied, saying: 'How would you expect a cat to reveal injuries?'

Robinson faces up to a year in jail if convicted of torturing and injuring animals. A judge will rule on Ms Procton's motion in January.

'It was just a spur of the moment, it just happened,' Robinson has since said. 'I shouldn't have done it.'

The kitten, King, was captured three days after the alleged attack, treated at an ASPCA hospital and then adopted.

Robinson's arrest was a result, at least in part, of enraged animal lovers using the power of social media to track down a suspect.

'We were able to identify him as part of an investigation behind the video,' an NYPD source told the New York Post. 'People who saw were really disturbed by it.'

One of the first steps was identifying the area where of New York where the attack occurred.

One Facebook user used video enhancing software to blow up the scene and see details that later led police to identify the scene of the crime as the Brevoort Houses in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.

Residents of the housing complex told police the stray cat was a fixture in the area.
