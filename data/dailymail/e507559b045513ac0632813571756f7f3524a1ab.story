Christopher Leggatt died of a heart attack after suffering a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. It is believed he would have survived if he had been able to have surgery quickly

A grieving daughter has accused the NHS of running a Monday to Friday service, blaming the death of her sport-loving father on Britain’s ‘healthcare lottery’.

Christopher Leggatt, 65, died as he was being transferred between hospitals as there were no surgeons available at the first because it was a weekend.

The father-of-four collapsed with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm as he refereed a football match - and had a 70 per cent chance of surviving a routine operation on it.

But he suffered a heart attack in the ambulance taking him from Bradford Royal Infirmary to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary.

Paramedics managed to revive him but his heart stopped again before he could be operated on.

His death was recorded at 6.15pm - two hours after he first arrived at Bradford Royal Infirmary.

An inquest was triggered when his daughter Andrea, 43, lodged a formal complaint.

After the case she said: ‘I don’t want my father to be another statistic.

‘I hope what has happened highlights the fact that the NHS as it stands is a Monday to Friday service.

‘If my father had collapsed on a weekday then the outcome would have been very different.

‘If he had been operated on straight 
away he would have most likely survived the operation but there were no 
surgeons working at the hospital in Bradford that weekend.

‘He was taken to Bradford because it was the nearest hospital but they didn’t have the means to treat him.

‘At the time it was a real shock but I
am not angry with the hospitals or the staff involved with what 
happened. It’s the system which needs to change.

‘The
healthcare service should not be part-time. I’m aware that the 
Government needs to make cuts to save money but this should not be at 
the expense of patients.’

She added: ‘Being angry and placing blame doesn’t bring my father back but I hope something good can come out of his death.

‘I hope that what happened might bring change to the system so another family doesn’t have to suffer like ours has.

‘It has completely destroyed our family and it was something that could have easily been avoided.’

When he collapsed, Mr Leggatt was rushed to Bradford Royal Infirmary. He was diagnosed quickly but the hospital did not have a surgeon on site as it was the weekend so he had to be transferred to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary. He died en route

Andrea, a company director, said despite sending a letter of complaint to the hospital, she has never received a response.

She
said: ‘At the inquest I learnt that if there had been someone there to 
operate, there was a 70 per cent chance he would have lived.

‘The operation is really simple and only takes around 40 minutes but it was the delay which killed him.

‘To treat a ruptured abdominal aortic
aneurysm it is like mending a pipe and the vast majority  of people 
make a full recovery from it.’

The
inquest in Bradford last week heard that Mr Leggatt, a ‘well and active
man’ from Pool-in-Wharfedale, West Yorkshire, had been diagnosed within
20 minutes of arriving at Bradford Royal Infirmary.

Paul
Needham, a surgical registrar with the Bradford Teaching Hospitals 
Trust at the time, said the transfer represented his best chance.

He said: ‘Our vascular surgical cover that day was provided by Huddersfield.

‘Our view was that a blue-light ambulance transfer would be more rapid than having a surgeon driving across [to Bradford].”

Consultant
vascular surgeon at Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Trust, Anver 
Mahomed, told the inquest that the two hospitals took turns to provide 
acute care cover as part of a formal network arrangement.

Mr Leggatt's daughter, Andrea, said: 'I hope what has happened highlights the fact that the NHS as it stands is a Monday to Friday service. If my father had collapsed on a weekday then the outcome would have been very different'

Assistant Coroner Dominic Bell said: ‘I am satisfied the decision to transfer the patient, though clearly associated with some risk, was appropriate.

‘The original assumption that this death was from natural causes must still stand.’

But he also asked the Bradford Trust to examine and consider adopting the arrangements some other regions have where paramedics can, based on their diagnosis, take patients to the most appropriate, rather than nearest, hospital.

He concluded: ‘The family will inevitably find it distressing to know that if the vascular surgery team had been at Bradford Mr Leggatt would have expected earlier surgery and, on the balance of probabilities, would have survived.

‘That, however, is not an issue that can appropriately be addressed by the individuals in this room.’

Mr Leggatt left a widow, Sue, and his daughter said his death had had a devastating impact on the whole family.

She added: ‘My father was a very charitable man who would do anything for anyone. He was very family orientated and was very involved in community life.

‘He had worked for Leeds City Council for most of his life and he didn’t deserve this kind of treatment.

‘I hope that people in power will take note of this and make the NHS a 24/7 service.

‘I know the economy is in a bad way at the moment but savings should be made from elsewhere.’

Andrea said she now plans to contact Government ministers directly.
