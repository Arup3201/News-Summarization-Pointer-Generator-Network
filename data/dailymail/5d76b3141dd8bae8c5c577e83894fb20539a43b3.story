With his menacing grin and a devilish look in his eye, does this shark remind you of anyone?

He's a dead ringer for Bruce, the great white from hit 2003 children's film Finding Nemo.

As movie fans will know, Bruce (voiced by Barry Humphries) is a friendly shark who tries – not always successfully – to resist the urge to eat other fish.

The shark above turned out to be pretty friendly too. 

It was one of 20 blacktip and tiger sharks that swarmed around photographer Mike Korostelev off the coast of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. 

They munched on floating bait, leaving Mr Korostelev free to take this snap.

Mr Korostelev said: 'Swimming with sharks is like stress relief for me. What could be better?

'It is not very dangerous if you know what are you doing and how to do it correctly and safely.

'Sharks are not interested in humans. They need only a tasty fish to satisfy their hunger.

'You just have to keep everything under control. Do not wave your hands and try to keep the sharks in sight at all times.

'Sometimes they will even collide with you, bump into the camera, but nothing bad happens.'

The photographer, who runs an adventure travel company, says taking pictures of sharks 'is not dangerous' 

The 32-year-old, who runs an adventure travel company and a group of divers placed bait into the water around their boat to entice the sharks.

Within a few minutes they were surrounded by blacktip and tiger sharks.

In search of a free meal, the sharks quickly devoured the fish - completely ignoring the humans in their territory.

Describing the dive, he added: 'The main problem when shooting sharks in South Africa is that there are too many! Everything is teeming with sharks.

'They're everywhere - swarming around your face, crashing into the camera, their sensitive noses poking into your legs.

'Therefore, to make a picture is extremely difficult.

'At the beginning of the dive, there was around seven sharks. But by the end we counted 20 already around us.'
