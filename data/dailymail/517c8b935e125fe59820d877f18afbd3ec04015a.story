Her celebrated career was launched by late fashion illustrator Antonio Lopez, and now Jerry Hall, along with Pat Cleveland and Marisa Berenson, is the face of a new MAC collection dedicated to his work.

In the Seventies, the three iconic models were known as Antonio's Girls, all working together for major fashion magazines; and Lopez, who died in 1987, aged 44, even lived with Ms Hall in Paris, having discovered her when she was a 17-year-old student.

Now, his distinctive sketches, which were used by Vogue, Valentino, Yves Saint Laurent and Versace, to name a few, will be available in the form of a disco-themed make-up collection.

The collection, which includes eye and lip palettes, as well as cosmetic bags, is full of vibrant fuchsias, striking violets and even an electric blue.

'Our collection with Antonio Lopez is symbolic of a time when indulgence was at its peak… there was a magic to his world and a time in history that hasn't been recaptured,' said James Gager, senior vice president and group creative director for MAC.

'I think people are lusting after that glamour, which is difficult to come by today. So, we felt this was the right moment to reintroduce Antonio Lopez's work to a wider audience, and the world to these women, who are still iconic and look really fantastic.

'They are steeped in an age that we are all intrigued by,' he added.

Each limited-edition make-up bag, mirror, tote and make-up compact are printed with Lopez's vibrant watercolour illustrations.

The Antonio Lopez collection will be available on September 5 online and September 12 in stores, for one month.
