A mother-of-one who was called ‘frog-face’ by school bullies is now earning a living as a top Katy Perry lookalike.

Suzy O'Neill, 26, had always been bullied for her big eyes and full lips - but after shedding three stone, she realised she was a dead ringer for the pop princess.

The two look so alike that even Suzy’s boyfriend Paul can't tell them apart - and has mistaken pictures of the LA-based diva for his own girlfriend.

Teased: Suzy ONeill had always been bullied for her big eyes and full lips - but after shedding three stone, she realised she was a dead ringer for Katy Perry

Now and then: Suzy, left now and right before her weight-loss, says when she uploaded pictures of her weight loss success onto Instagram strangers began messaging her remarking on her resemblance to the pop star

Lookalike: Suzy says even her boyfriend Paul sometimes struggles to tell her apart from Katy Perry

Now Suzy is working as a professional celebrity double after being snapped up by one of the country's best lookalike agencies.

Suzy, from Maidstone, Kent, said: 'I'd always had grief over the way I looked, when I was in school people used to say I looked like a frog.

'After I had my little boy David, now seven, I put on loads of weight, and I didn't really ever have time to bother with my appearance.'

She continued: 'But when I broke up with my partner I decided it was time for a new me.

'I dyed my hair black, and started making more of an effort with my make-up.

'I hated covering my size 16 body in baggy clothes, so I was determined to lose weight and wear the slinky dresses that I loved.'

Before the change: Suzy says she put on weight after the birth of her son, and came to hate her size 16 frame

Agency: Suzy was snapped up by Susan Scott Lookalikes - and now makes her living pretending to be Katy

Suzy started putting photos of her new look on social media, which gave her confidence an immediate boost: 'I uploaded pictures of my weight 
loss and dramatic new image on instagram, and I got loads of strangers 
sending me messages telling me that I looked like Katy Perry.

'At
 first, I really couldn’t see it myself, but when I started slipping 
into size 10 dresses, I began to notice it more - and thought why not 
use it to my advantage!'

Suzy was signed by Susan Scott Lookalikes - and now makes her living pretending to be Katy.

But
 being a dead ringer for pop's hottest girl has its downside - and Suzy 
has been harassed on nights out with her friends - and even yelled at by
 Russel Brand fans, after the pair’s split.

She
 said: 'I do think it’s funny when people do a second take when I walk 
past - they're probably trying to figure out what Katy Perry is doing in
 Kent.'

Copycat: Suzy loves to watch what the star is up to and mirroring her look for work

It's Katy! Suzy says her resemblance to Miss Perry has even led to her being verbally harassed on nights out

I'm a fun-loving girl: Suzy says her new image has helped her find the 'real her again

She continued: 'A bloke stopped me in a bar once and asked if he could buy me a drink - when I said no thanks, he yelled at me: "No wonder Russell Brand dumped you!"

'Even my boyfriend Paul sometimes struggles. He'l see new photos of Katy on the internet and say: "When did you do this shoot?"

'I love watching what Katy’s up to and mirroring her look for work. I’ve got loads of outfits similar to her, and I’ve even got a blue wig like the one she wore in the California Gurls video.

'I feel as though my new image has helped me find the real me again. I’m a fun-loving girl and I want that to come across in my work.'
