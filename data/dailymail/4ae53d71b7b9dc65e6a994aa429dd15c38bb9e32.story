A challenging and varied route for the 98th Giro d'Italia was unveiled in Milan on Monday.

The 3,481.8-kilometre event, scheduled to take place from May 9 to May 31 2015, features one individual time-trial, one team time-trial, seven uphill finishes and seven sprint stages.

The race will start in Riviera dei Fiori in the Liguria region and finish in Milan.

The Giro d'Italia 2015 route was unveiled with uphill finishes in Madonna di Campiglio, Cervinia and Sestriere

Highlights include the uphill finishes in Madonna di Campiglio, Cervinia and Sestriere, while decisive time gaps could be claimed on the 59.2km time-trial from Treviso to Valdobbiadene.

The challenge for the race won by Colombian Nairo Quintana in 2014 is who will contest for the pink jersey, with home favourite Vincenzo Nibali likely to line up in defence of his Tour de France title against Vuelta a Espana champion Alberto Contador and 2013 Tour winner Chris Froome.

Colombian Rigoberto Uran was in Milan on Monday and could target the maglia rosa after finishing second to Quintana in May.
