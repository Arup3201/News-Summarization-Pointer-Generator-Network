A species of mosquito capable of transmitting a deadly disease have been found thriving on marshes in the Thames Estuary.

Colonies of culex modestus, which can spread the West Nile virus in one bite, have been discovered by scientists at sites across North Kent. 

The virus, which killed 286 people in America in 2012, can cause flu-like symptoms that last several days, and in serious cases can cause swelling of the brain and spinal cord.

There is currently no vaccine against the infection, which can also lead to a fatal form of Meningitis.

Experts from Public Health England have collected samples of the species at wetland sites across north Kent - including two on the Isle of Sheppey.

A call for risk assessments to be updated has since been sparked after the killer insect was found thriving on the island, which is largely marshland on the Thames estuary.

According to an article published in the Parasites and Vectors journal, an average of 27.97 adult mosquitoes were caught each night at a barn and a field in Elmley and an average of 26.17 of them – nearly 94 per cent – were culex modestus.

Dr Jolyon Medlock, from Public Health England, said: ‘Culex modestus seems to exploit the ditches in the north Kent marshes, and owing to the large number of wild birds and farm animals, there is sufficient blood source to sustain populations.’

But the West Nile virus disease, and the similar Usutu virus, were not detected in any samples taken in the study.

However, the scientists behind the study have warned the abundance of the insets highlights the need to look again at it potentially reaching the UK .

There have only been four cases confirmed in the UK since 2002 - three in people returning from North America and one in a person returning from the Middle East - and no one has ever contracted the disease in the UK.

The mosquito can be found in many parts of the world including China, Russia, Spain and Poland, and unlike other species, it is not tropical.

Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds and can then spread the virus to humans and other animals they bite.

The virus cannot be spread from close person-to-person contact - for example, by kissing someone who is infected.

Although migratory birds, which are also monitored, are known to land on Sheppey after returning from warmer countries, so far none has been known to carry West Nile virus here.

It is not certain how culex modestus reached the area, and previous surveys between 2001 and 2003 found no reported evidence of it being here.

Its population in the region appears to be increasing as a previous study from 2010 reported 75 per cent of adult mosquitoes were culex modestus.

The latest survey, carried out during the peak months of July to September in 2013, showed the species accounting for 90 per cent of all samples collected on the marshes.

But this could be down to numbers varying from year to year depending on the weather.

Dr Medlock added: ‘This species is recognised as a potential vector of West Nile virus, and that is why increased survey effort has targeted the region.' 

Last year, public health experts ramped-up efforts to detect mosquitoes capable of carrying potentially lethal diseases by building detection stations at ferry ports in Southern England.

Experts fear the culex modestus and Asian tiger mosquito, which can spread dengue fever, may enter the country due to the increasingly mild conditions.
