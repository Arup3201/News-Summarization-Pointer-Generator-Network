She's famous for her fresh-faced looks and appears far younger than her 38 years but according to How Not To Get Old presenter Louise Redknapp, youth doesn't always equal beauty.

'I think the important thing is looking 
good for your age and not necessarily trying to look younger,' she revealed in an exclusive interview with MailOnline.

'I think 
the women who look the best are those who look their age, but have 
looked after themselves and look good for it, rather than those who are 
trying to look 20 years younger.

Bare-faced beauty: Louise appeared sans make-up in a fund-raising campaign for Children in Need

'As
you see wrinkles appearing it can be quite aggravating and of course 
there are things you can do about them but personally I think it is best
to accept what's happening and make the best of it.'

Redknapp, who along with her presenting work has co-founded cosmetics company, Wild about Beauty, added: 'My tips would be to look after your 
skin: although my skincare routine is simple, I believe it can still be 
really effective.

'People don't need to spend hundreds of pounds on 
products and spend hours on a routine - sometimes all you need is a good 
moisturiser.

'Also keep your make-up simple. The older we get, less is 
definitely [becomes] more.'

Redknapp certainly knows about paring down her make-up bag. Last year, she appeared bare-faced alongside Caroline Flack and Lulu to help raise money for Children in Need.

Despite the lack of make-up, her fresh-faced, glowing complexion appeared enviably youthful and wrinkle-free, although Redknapp complains that she's had to deal with pigmentation problems and patchy skin since becoming a mother in 2004.

Unable to find products to sort out her skin, she turned instead to make-up artist Kim Jacob for help.

The result was paraben-free make-up line, Wild about Beauty, and Redknapp is justifiably optimistic about its future.

Business: Louise set up Wild about Beauty with the help of make-up artist, Kim Jacob

Favourite: Louise's hero product is Wild about Beauty Sheer Glow Moisture Tint SPF 20, £19.00

'I am very proud to have the business,' she revealed. 
'We are still on a journey and have a long way to go. 

'Starting up a 
company, especially in today's world is tough - it's dog-eat-dog out 
there.  Not many businesses even make it into their first year of 
trading so I feel very proud that we have been able to get it off of the
ground and into the make-up bags of so many women everywhere. 

'My 
aspiration is that the company will grow and one day every woman will be
using at least one Wild about Beauty product in their make-up routine.'

Her own favourite product is the Sheer Glow Moisture Tint, which along with SPF20, deals instantly with patchy skin.

'It is the one product that really evens my skin out and I can see a difference instantly - I don't leave the house without it,' she enthuses.

She also makes a point of being careful about looking after her complexion, although admits that she, like many other working mothers, doesn't have time for a complex routine.

'I don't spend a massive amount of time on my skincare or
make-up routine - I get things done really quickly,' says Redknapp.

'I choose products 
that are quick and easy to use so that I don't have to waste too much 
time on it all.

'Who has the time to spend hours on a beauty routine when
you have young children to run after?'

So does she have any advice for other mothers on the run? 'I
think a really good skin prep followed by a tinted moisturiser is very 
important,' she says, seriously.

'This takes the effort out of getting really nice, even skin 
and gives a more natural look than piling on layers of foundation.

'It 
can also save you a lot of time and avoid that horrible dreaded 
patchiness that you only notice when you've run out of the door and got 
in the car!'

Wild about Beauty is available on QVC. Louise Redknapp will appear on the channel on 13th September.
