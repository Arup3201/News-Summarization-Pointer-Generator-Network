A Conservative website has been caught out using pictures of young models to promote its recruitment campaign for the next general election instead of real Tory activists.

Voters logging on to a website designed to attract younger supporters might have expected to see people who were actually Tories.

But instead they were greeted by a large stock photograph which has also been used to promote universities in Australia.

The lead picture on the Conservative's general election recruitment website uses models, not real Tory activists

A Tory spokesman said the other pictures on the site were of genuine activists on the campaign trail

The Team 2015 campaign is led by Tory chairman Grant Shapps

The Team 2015 campaign is led by party chairman Grant Shapps, who has previously come under fire for using a pseudonym to promote his own internet business.

The pictures of smiling young people appears under the 'Make It Happen' slogan, alongside a message from Mr Shapps.

But the use of the stock image on the website, revealed in today's Daily Mirror, came to light when the same photograph was spotted on a website Down Under.

Last year it emerged a ’hard working family’ used in Tory adverts had also been pictured promoting insurance brokers, builders and dentists.

On the latest website, Mr Shapps writes underneath the banner: 'We need to mobilise our hard working volunteers to ensure that we can deliver on the ground.

'That is why we are looking to recruit for Team 2015 so we can deploy our best troops to where they are needed most.'

But the ’hard-working volunteers’ are all models posing for stock picture libraries available to newspapers, magazines and websites around the world.

Labour vice-chairman Michael Dugher told the Mirror: 'Once again the Conservatives are taking people for fools. After the infamous airbrushed posters of David Cameron, this is just the latest example that proves that their desperate attempt to look young, diverse and in touch with modern Britain is a complete deception and a sham.'

A Tory party source said that many websites and publications routinely use stock images and all the other photographs on the Campaign 2015 site were genuine Tory volunteers.

Grant Shapps was pictured wearing a 'Michael Green' alias as he promoted his internet money-making business

As party chairman Mr Shapps has overall responsible for the campaign but friends insist he did not choose the image.

However, he has previously worked as an expert in website marketing.

Last year it emerged he used the fictional alter ego ‘Michael Green’ to write motivational material for the internet marketing company he founded, HowToCorp.

It suggested buying a jet-ski, learning to play the guitar and knitting as ways to beat the recession blues.

The Tory chairman was pictured at a conference wearing a name tag with his alias.

He said the name tag was worn as a joke and was the pseudonym he wrote books, including How To Get Stinking Rich, under. He said he used the alias to keep his political and business interests separate.
