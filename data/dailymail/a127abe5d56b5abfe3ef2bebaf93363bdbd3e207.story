Michelle Singleton or Catherine Harris? 66-year-old Singleton has been living in a houseboat under the alias Harris for 18 years

A 66-year-old missing woman who failed to appear in court 18 years ago for payroll check fraud has been found on a houseboat in Key West.

Michele Singleton, 66, of Kansas City was called to federal court in 1996 and she didn't show up. Since then, a federal fugitive warrant was issued for her arrest.

Instead of facing the authorities, Singleton changed her name to Catherine Harris and went into hiding on a boat moored at 15 Hilton Haven Drive thinking no one would ever discover her true identity. She was wrong.

NBC reports that when Monroe County detectives obtained a photo of singleton, Sgt. Donald CatalaÂ  said that he had seen the woman many times in Key West.

A records check of the area showed a woman named Catherine Harris living at the Hilton Haven address whose license photo was suspiciously familiar to a photo of Singleton.

When the Secret Service went to Singleton's houseboat to investigate her identity they asked her for an id and all she had was an expired license.

They then asked her for a birth certificate and when she pulled out her file, important papers fell out including her real birth certificate and social security card.

Cornered, Singleton told police that she'd gotten a birth certificate with the name Harris after she'd fled Kansas City. Singleton admitted to being her true identity and has been taken into custody on fugitive charges.

According to Keys Net, Singleton was planning to sell her houseboat and then move to the Dominican Republic.
