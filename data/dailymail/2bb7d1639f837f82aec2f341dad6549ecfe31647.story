This is the pregnant teacher who schoolboy Will Cornick wanted to murder in front of other children. 

The crazed 16-year-old fantasised about brutally taking the life of Sinéad Miley’s unborn child.

Cornick also intended to target Andrew Kellett, his head of year, in the atrocity he spent three years meticulously planning.

He stabbed Spanish teacher Ann Maguire, 61, to death in her classroom, but was not able to carry out his aim of attacking the other two staff members.

Mrs Miley, 38, is believed to have had a baby girl, and is on maternity leave. She declined to comment from her family home in South Yorkshire yesterday.

On the morning he murdered Mrs Maguire, Cornick told a girl in school he intended to stab Miss Miley in the stomach ‘so as to kill her unborn child’. The court heard ‘he had not had the slightest problem’ with the teacher and there was no explanation as to why he should want to target her.

Mrs Miley had been a pupil at Corpus Christi before returning as a teacher.

She was close to Mrs Maguire, and her tribute to the much-loved ‘mother of the school’ was read in court. It said: ‘Ann Maguire was such an amazing woman and teacher. She taught me when I was a pupil and supported me in my career since I have been teaching at Corpus. Ann loved her job and wanted all her kids to work hard and reach their full potential.’

The court heard that Cornick told fellow pupils Mr Kellett, an assistant headmaster, was also on his seemingly random hit list.

Again there was no known reason for his implacable hatred, although it did emerge that Mr Kellett had spoken to Cornick two months before the murder after he defied a ban on going to a bowling trip imposed by Mrs Maguire for not doing homework.

When Mrs Maguire came into the meeting, Cornick stood up to walk out. This led to another meeting the next day with the teenager’s parents.

It is not clear whether this incident increased his hatred of Mr Kellett.

Teenage killer: Cornick, 16, sits in the dock at Leeds Crown Court during his sentencing hearing

On Monday, Cornick was given a life term and told he would stay locked up for a minimum of 20 years.

Passing sentence at Leeds Crown Court, Mr Justice Coulson said experts considered him such a danger that he might die behind bars.

His crime has shocked the public, leading to concerns over why he was never reported to the authorities.

Yesterday Leeds City Council announced that an inquiry, dubbed a ‘learning lessons review’, would be held to report on ‘all circumstances’ surrounding the tragedy.

Cornick messaged his friends on Facebook about his intentions, and his irrational fury at Mrs Maguire was known to the school and his parents.

In the attack, which it emerged he spent three years planning, he brought a large kitchen knife to school and stabbed Mrs Maguire repeatedly in the back and neck from behind as she worked at her desk. 

Teenagers fled screaming and the teacher staggered into a corridor where she was helped into a side room by a brave colleague who put herself between Cornick and his victim. The murderer returned to his desk, saying ‘Good times’, and waited calmly to be arrested.

It later emerged the then 15-year-old had sent chilling messages on Facebook in which he spoke of ‘brutally killing’ Mrs Maguire and spending the rest of his life behind bars.

In one post he wrote she deserved ‘more than death more than pain’.

The inquiry will be carried out by the Leeds Safeguarding Children Board and headed by its independent chairman Jane Held, a national expert on child protection issues with more than 30 years’ experience.

Mrs Held said: ‘Our thoughts and deepest sympathies remain with all those affected by this tragic event.

‘Following this unprecedented incident the members of the Leeds Safeguarding Children Board have already agreed to work with the school and other agencies, to look into all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, and help with any learning for all agencies involved.’

A decision on whether to hold a serious case review – a more formal form of investigation – has not yet been made.

The safeguarding board inquiry team will involve members from the council, police, health and education services.

A spokesman said it was ‘very likely’ that the team’s report will be published, although it is ‘not a requirement’ to do so.

‘They will be looking at everything and talking to everybody involved,’ said the spokesman.

On the morning of the murder Cornick showed other pupils knives and told them he intended to attack the teacher, but no one took him seriously enough to report him.

Although his extreme dislike of Mrs Maguire was known to the school it is not clear whether any members of staff had heard talk about his murder plan.

Too harsh: Penelope Gibbs, chairman of the Standing Committee for Youth Justice, said the sentence given to murderer William Cornick was too long

The headmaster of Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds was not available for comment.

Public fury over the crime was yesterday fuelled by comments from a senior youth justice campaigner, who said the sentence was too long.

Penelope Gibbs, the chairman of the Standing Committee for Youth Justice (SCYJ) umbrella group of charities and campaign groups, said: ‘I don’t think a child – and he was a child – should get a life sentence because they are young, their brain is not mature and a life sentence is indeterminate, it could last forever. I think no other western European country would impose a life sentence on a teenager.

‘Do we want him to be rehabilitated? Do we want him to leave prison the lowest risk possible of causing more harm to others? Yes. How long do we need to achieve that, rather than how long do we need to punish him for.

‘We do need to punish him but I think to punish him for longer than he’s been alive for is disproportionate.’

But she received an internet backlash from parents who supported a long prison term.

Emma Sutcliffe commented: ‘Mrs Maguire taught me 20 years ago, my daughter was two classrooms away when this happened. Too light a sentence? Not at all… he was on his way to attack other teachers and one of those was pregnant! He deserved to be sectioned for life to be totally honest.’

Louise Longbottom, the mother of a pupil ‘in the next classroom’, also welcomed the lengthy sentence. She said the family have to ‘live with this everyday’ and the parents have been left to ‘pick up the pieces.’
