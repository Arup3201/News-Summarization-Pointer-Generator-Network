A biting arctic blast rattled from the Midwest to the Northeast this morning, sending temperatures plummeting and blanketing some areas with snow and sleet.

Parts of New York, Chicago and New England, among others, are seeing the first snows of the season while nearly a third of the country can expect temperatures 10 to 20 degrees below normal for this time of the year, meteorologists warned.

Temperatures in the Great Plains and Upper Midwest dropped as low as single digits on Tuesday morning, while Texas and mid-Atlantic states saw temperatures in the 20s, NBC reported.

In Chicago on Monday, the National 
Weather service recorded 0.4 inches of snow - the first of the season 
and a week ahead of schedule - and today, the temperature is expected to reach 24 degrees, which is 11 below normal for the date.

And the Weather Service reported that even the Southeast can expect surprisingly low temperatures in the teens.

'If you haven't gotten your winter coat out down here itâ€™s time to do so,' Tom Niziol, a winter weather expert at the Weather Channel, told southerners.

As rain and clouds turn to snow, areas of the Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley, upstate New York and New England could see a dusting of snow this morning, according to the Weather Channel.

There could also be a little across New Jersey and New York City, which could make the morning commute more difficult, forecasters warned.

Cold front: A NOAA satellite image shows a cold front with rain and snow showers moving across the Northeast, and the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys early on Tuesday morning

In these areas, the snow could settle on grass but is not expected to accumulate on roads.

But they said it would not be enough for a
'snow day' for kids and that there would not be a Great Lake snowstorm,
as sometimes occurs this time of year.

In Massachusetts, snow is expected to fall but won't be around for long.

'No need to break out the shovels this early,' meteorologists reported on Boston.com.

In upstate New York and Chicago where the snow has hit harder, commuters were warned their visibility could be reduced.

Hard hit: Three inches of snow and gray skies hit the area of Lake Michigan in New Buffalo, Michigan over night. A cold front is forcing icy temperatures across the U.S., bringing the first snows to the east

Forecasters also warned that the snow 
that fell yesterday across Illinois will likely turn to slush today, 
making roads wet and potentially slippery.

The
icy cold front moved swiftly across the U.S. thanks to a jet stream at 
30,000 feet, where strong winds are moving at 150 knots. It will push 
arctic air eastward throughout today and tomorrow.

Boston.com
reported that the speed of the wind means it will not last and that 
residents can expect milder temperatures by the end of the week and 
weekend.

No threat: As in New Buffalo, Michigan (pictured), the snow is expected just to be a light dusting

Spreading: Images shared on Twitter this morning show the first snows at Western, left, and on the UWM campus in Milwaukee, Wisconsin

Forecast: By Wednesday, high pressure will provide dry and quiet conditions for most of the country and by the weekend, temperatures are expected to become milder again
