Terrified residents were forced to jump for their lives as a fire - believed to have been started inside a wheelie bin - spread to their block of flats and killed one man in his home.

A 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of starting three fires, which broke out between 2.15am and 2.45am today at the three-storey maisonettes in Southey Close, near Walsall, West Midlands, and in nearby bushes.

Neighbours said they heard the victim 'banging on windows' and screaming for help as the blaze engulfed his apartment.

He was found slumped in his flat by emergency crews soon after and pronounced dead at the scene.

'It was horrible last night, you could 
hear (him) screaming for help, because the flat was near his front door 
he was blocked in,' said Keith Hammerton, a local plasterer.Â 

'You could hear him banging on the 
windows. People were jumping out of second floor windows because the 
fire started on the ground floor and spread really quickly. It was 
absolutely terrifying.

'He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.'

Daniel Sharples, 29, was with his 
partner Rachel Pettiford, 20, and their seven-month-old baby in their 
first-floor flat when the fire started.

'It was about 2am and we heard all the noise,' Mr Sharples, a metal spinner, said. 'We could hear the fire engines and could hear things popping and people screaming.'

Occupants
living in the middle floor were forced to jump to safety in the 
commotion while firefighters used ladders to rescue those on the top 
floor.

A woman in her 20s was taken to 
hospital with an ankle injury after she jumped 25ft from a second-storey
window to escape the inferno, and a woman in her 50s was treated for 
smoke inhalation.

A police spokesman said: 'A number of
people had to be rescued from the flats and around 50 people were 
evacuated due to concerns over the safety of the maisonettes.'

Resident
Gavin Grant, 24, said he awoke to the sound of fire crackling and his 
neighbours screaming, while others shouted for help through the windows.

'There
were melted bins on the floor at the back of the flat it looked like 
somebody had set them on fire,' he added. 'It all happened so fast.'

Another occupant, who didn't want to be named, described the early morning blaze as 'chaos'.

'There
were around 30 to 40 firefighters and the police,' he said. 'I thought 
someone had left the gas on but then I heard someone had set fire to the
wheelie bins. It's unbelievable.'

Officers arrested the 20-year-old man
at an address in New Invention, near Walsall, on suspicion of 
committing arson with intent to endanger life. He was detained a short time after the fires and is still being questioned by police.

Detective Inspector Warren Hines, from the Force Major Investigation Team, said officers were examining CCTV footage and going door-to-door, asking the community for information.

'This is as serious as it gets,' he said.

'An innocent man has lost his life in
a place where he should have been safe - his own home. People need to 
examine their consciences and if they do know anything, they need to 
contact the police as a matter of urgency.'

The fires broke out between 2.15am 
and 2.45am today at a block of maisonettes in Southey Close, near 
another property in Wychbold Way, and in bushes in Crab Lane.

Emergency services believe the fatal blaze began in a wheelie bin adjacent to the flats.

The second fire, which also appeared 
to have started in a rubbish bin, was reported to police at around 
2.35am, and a small number of people were rescued.

The third blaze, in which bushes were set alight, was spotted by officers on patrol at 2.45am.

Two ambulance crews, a paramedic area support officer and the Hazardous Area Response Team attended the scene.

A West Midlands Ambulance Service 
spokeswoman said: 'Along with the fire service, ambulance crews attended
a fire in the building where one man was confirmed dead.

'A woman in her 20s who was thought to have jumped from a second floor window to escape the fire had an ankle injury. She was immobilised on a spinal board. A woman in her 50s had smoke inhalation.

'Another woman in her twenties and a boy and a girl were treated at the scene for the effects of breathing in smoke.'

The two women were taken to New Cross and Walsall Manor Hospitals.

DI Hines said forensics were combing the block of flats for evidence.

'We have launched a full investigation into the series of events this morning,' he said.

'At this early stage he is yet to be identified and we are in the process of locating his family. A number of scenes are currently cordoned off whilst we carry out forensic searches of the area.

'We now appeal for people in the community, or anyone who might know anything, to come forward with information to help our inquiry.'
