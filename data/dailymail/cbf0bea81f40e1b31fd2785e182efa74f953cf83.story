Plans for a Formula One race on the streets of London, which would see cars roaring at up to 200mph around some of the city's most famous landmarks, will be unveiled tonight.

Drivers including British stars Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button would start from a grid outside Buckingham Palace and race around a 3.2-mile West End circuit taking in sights such as Nelson's Column and Piccadilly Circus.

Formula One chief executive Bernie Ecclestone is said to have offered to pay more than £35million to stage the grand prix in the capital.

London Grand Prix

Experts believe that as many as 
120,000 spectators would watch the race, which Mr Ecclestone believes 
would be even more impressive than the Monaco Grand Prix - currently the
most famous and glamorous of motor racing’s street circuits.

He
said: ‘Think what it would do for tourism. It would be fantastic — good
for London, good for England — a lot better than the Olympics.’

Should London host a Formula One street race?

Mr
Ecclestone, 81, has long wanted London to host a grand prix, having 
seen the huge potential after a Formula One demonstration event on 
Regent Street in 2004 attracted thousands to watch Button and another 
British former world champion, Nigel Mansell, in action.

He
said that he was prepared to promote the race, which is likely to be 
staged in the summer and is expected to generate as much as £100million 
in takings from spectators and tourists.

The
cost of hosting a Grand Prix runs to millions of pounds, but Mr 
Ecclestone believes a London race would be so popular that it would pay 
for itself.

The event, to be called the London 
GP, could even be held a night to help create what planners believe will
be a 'carnival atmosphere'.

London Mayor Boris Johnson gave qualified support today to the plans.

Mr Johnson said he was 'broadly positive' about the plan as long as air quality and noise issues were addressed.

Speaking
as he launched a new cable car system across the River Thames in London
today, the Mayor said: 'I am always interested in projects that attract
jobs and bring growth.'

He said it was important to see if there was 'a really good economic case' for a London Grand Prix.

Mr
Johnson went on: 'The question of air quality and noise impact will 
have to be looked at. I am broadly positive providing we can satisfy the
air quality and noise issues.'

The race was originally proposed by the Santander bank, which sponsors the British Grand Prix at Silverstone.

It would not take place for several years and is expected to complement, rather than replace, the annual Silverstone meeting.

Santander spokesman Nav Sidhu told 
Metro: 'There's a tremendous appetite for Formula One in the UK - more 
than anywhere else - and London is more than capable of hosting world 
class events whether they be the marathon, the jubilee or rock concerts 
in Hyde Park.

'Putting a temporary Formula One 
circuit into a city like London would involve serious challenges, but 
every single one has been met.'

Hamilton
and Button are believed to have been involved in the design of the 
proposed circuit, which would see drivers racing at full throttle for 
three-quarters of each lap.

The course would begin on The Mall 
outside Buckingham Palace, turning towards St James's Palace before 
heading on towards the Ritz hotel.

Iconic: The Houses of Parliament would be part of the dramatic backdrop to the race

Sightseeing: The proposed Formula One race in London would be contested on a circuit taking in landmarks such as Piccadilly Circus

The drivers would race at 180mph on a straight along Piccadilly to a corner near the Wellington Monument on Park Lane.

Cars would then come back past Buckingham Palace to another straight along Birdcage Walk to Parliament Square.

The closing stages of the circuit would take in the Embankment, Trafalgar Square and Admiralty Arch, ending back on the Mall where the race began.

Nigel Currie, director of leading sports agency Brand-Rapport, told the Times that takings at the event could be double or even treble the £100million estimate.

He said: 'It could be a commercial bonanza for Formula One and London. A successful London Olympics will show that there is an appetite for big events and bringing a grand prix to the people on their doorstep will attract massive attention.'

Last week a company called International Transport Solutions revealed plans for a London Grand Prix around the Olympic Park site but Mr Ecclestone insisted he knew nothing about the proposal.
