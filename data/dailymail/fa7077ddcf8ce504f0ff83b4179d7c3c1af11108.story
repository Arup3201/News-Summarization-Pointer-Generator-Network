Outspoken Perth preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne has penned another furious tirade. 

But this time, the man who once branded Australian law enforcement authorities 'the real terrorists' was venting his anger on a different topic - the 'despicable' game of rugby league and its fans.  

In a Facebook post addressed to his followers, the Perth preacher recalled recent scenes of league fever in the heart of Bulldogs territory - Bankstown and Punchbowl in south-west Sydney. 

He said it was 'horrific'. 

Devout: Mohammed Junaid Thorne has not hesitated to make his opinions known in recent months. 

Passionate: Bulldogs fans turned out en masse to last night's grand final showdown. 

Bulldogs territory: The blue and white was out in force in south-west Sydney in recent weeks. 

'Cars racing down the road driven by maniacs, horning and honking, disturbing Allah's creation, Muslim women (Hijabis unfortunately most of the time) hanging out of the windows screaming and yelling at the top of their lungs, and other despicable and despising scenes, all unfortunately done by Muslims, some of them in their Hijab or Islamic attire.'

'Spending a few days... especially around areas like Bankstown, Punchbowl and its surroudnings makes a Muslim bewildered and astonished to what his eyes see, but his heart struggles to accept and his brain to believe.'

He lamented that the celebrations were not happening because of an occasion, like the religious festival, Eid al-Adha. Or because the United States had hypothetically ceased all airstrikes on the Islamic State.

'So why is all this happening?!' he continued. 'Sadly brothers and sisters, all this is because of a dirty game of rugby.' 

'A game between two teams named after animals, that has caused grown men to lose their minds, grown women to lose their modesty, and some to lose their faith.' 

An enthusiastic Bulldogs fan wields a sign at the preliminary final against the Penrith Panthers earlier this month.

He wrote that the scene was an example of 'Muslims in our time' and expressed his disgust with some Islamic women who drape themselves in the Bulldogs flag.

He said they 'strip themselves from their clothes and modesty, to wrap themselves with a flag that has a dog on it, and dance side to side, rubbing shoulders and other parts of the body with tattooed men.'

'As one of our beloved Sheikhs said before: Football has become the Taghut of our time, the modern devil of this era,' he said. 

'While the cries of our orphan children, our raped women, and the calls for help from our helpless elders all over the world failed to unite the Muslims, we see the flag that carries the picture of a dog uniting Sunnis, Shia, Christians, Atheists,and all other sorts of people.' 

Thorne has not shied from controversy in recent months. 

He has described Australian law enforcement authorities as the 'real terrorists', and has also said the shooting death of Numan Haider, 18, was 'cold-blooded murder'. 

Last month, he reported receiving death threats from 'Australians living in Australia'. 

Mr Thorne concluded his post, published yesterday, the day of the grand final, by saying he 'dreaded' what would happen at the game.

But the streets of south-west Sydney were not filled with much celebration last night. 

Many Bulldogs fans were left disappointed when the Rabbitohs thumped the Canterbury side 30 - 6 in their first grand final victory in 43 years.
