A sheep has sold for a staggering £152,000 at a livestock auction in Scotland - almost double the price of a Porsche. 

The eight-month old Texel ram, called Vicious Sid, is now the second most expensive sheep ever sold in the UK.

Texels, originally from the island of Texel in the Netherlands, are currently the most popular sheep for breeding in the UK because of the quality of the meat.

Robert Cockburn's daughter, Jasmine, 2, says goodbye to Sid, sold to a three-way consortium for £152,000

Sid was sold by shepherd Robert Cockburn, from Crieff in Perthshire, to a three-way consortium which includes well-known breeders Charlie Boden, the Campbell family   and the Blackwood family. 

They paid £145,000 guineas - or just over £152,000 - at the Scottish National Texel sale at Lanark Market on Thursday and will now use his semen to artificially inseminate ewes.

In keeping with tradition, the majority of farm livestock, including horses, are still sold in guineas at markets. A guinea is worth about £1.05p.

Mr Cockburn is a shepherd at the well-known Blackface sheep flock at Connachan, near Crieff, but sheep are also his paying hobby.  

He has 25 ewes in his Knap flock of Texels which he shares with girlfriend Dianne Wood. 

Their daughter Jasmine, 2, was at Lanark to witness the memorable occasion and their second child is due in October.

After the sale of Sid, Mr Cockburn said: 'I knew it was a good one, but I didn't think it would make that price.' 

Weighing around 100 Kgs, Sid is worth approximately £1,500 a kilo.

Ayrshire breeder Alan Blackwood, 27, was part of the three-way consortium that purchased the lamb. 

He said: 'He is just completely different and has a real class about him. He has a presence around him that is hard to explain. He is just a head and shoulders above the rest, with so much character.

'I knew as soon as I saw him on show that he would be the best one I would see.'

Mr Blackwood said the prized lamb would be transported to Edinburgh where his semen would be frozen and stored as back-up 'in case anything happened to him'.

He will them be shared with the consortium and used to artificially inseminate ewes. 

Sid was sold at  the high price because of his pedigree and the prospect that he will father more sheep like him

Sid is believed to be second most expensive sheep ever bought in the UK. The average cost of a lamb in the UK is around £100 - but top quality rams used for breeding fetch much more. 

The highest sum ever achieved for a sheep is £231,000 (or 220,000 guineas), paid by Jimmy Douglas for the eight-month-old Texel tup, Deveronvale Perfection, at Lanark market, in August 2009. 

It was reported in September 2011 that a single Dolan sheep - a rare breed of only about 1000 - was up for sale in China.

The highest bid received was for £14 million yuan (£1.4 million), but no sale was agreed. 

Top Dolan sheep can secure as much as 300,000 yuan (£30,300) for one dose of semen.
