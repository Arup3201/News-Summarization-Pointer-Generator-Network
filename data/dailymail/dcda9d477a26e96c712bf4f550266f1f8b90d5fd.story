A husband who watched his wife die in a car crash gave emotional testimony in court at the trial of the Melrose Place actress accused of killing her.

Fred Seeman told the New Jersey court on 
Wednesday that it was like getting hit by a bomb when his car was struck
by an SUV driven by Amy Locane-Bovenizer.

Mr Seeman said the SUV's headlights were 'way, way off' in the distance as he turned into the driveway of his Montgomery Township home on June 27, 2010.

Trauma: Widower Fred Seeman tells the New Jersey court on Wednesday about the night he lost his wife Helene when their car was struck by an SUV driven by Amy Locane-Bovenizer

Prompted: An attorney for the actress, pictured left as Sandy in the 1990s TV series Melrose Place,  argued her having been chased by another driver causing her to speed and crash into the Seemans' vehicle

He tearfully told jurors how he heard gurgling noises from his wife Helene.

The
prosecution and the defense agree 40-year-old Locane-Bovenizer was drunk. However 
the defense claimed the actress was distracted by another driver who was 
chasing her after she rear-ended their vehicle and Seeman turned in front of her.

The woman, identified in 
court as Maureen Ruckelshaus, honked her horn and flashed her lights, 
causing Locane-Bovenizer to drive nearly 20 mph over the speed limit on 
narrow country roads.

The chase ended when the actress slammed 
into the Seemans' vehicle as it pulled into a driveway. The couple had 
been returning from dinner with friends at a restaurant ten 
minutes from home.

Mr Seeman, a 62-year-old Manhattan real estate attorney, suffered critical lung and rib injuries in the crash.

He told the court that 2010 had been a
'last glorious year' for the family and that he and his wife, an art 
adviser, had recently watched their youngest son graduate from high 
school, according to nj.com.

Somerset 
County Assistant Prosecutor Matthew Murphy said at the opening of the trial on October 4 that Locane-Bovenizer had 
eight to ten drinks at two gatherings before the accident and had a 
blood-alcohol level three times the legal limit.

'Death was probable, not merely possible,' Mr Murphy told jurors. 'These circumstances were so extreme that death was probable.'

Locane-Bovenizer, a mother of two, is 
charged with aggravated manslaughter and assault by auto and faces up to
30 years in prison if she is convicted.

Locane-Bovenizer appeared on 13 episodes of Melrose Place in 1992 in the role of Sandy Louise Harling.

She also appeared in numerous movies including Cry-Baby that starred Johnny Depp, School Ties and Secretary.

During court hearings last summer, a police testified that the actress was found ‘giggling’ and appearing ‘happy’ as she sat in a drainage ditch following the collision in June of 2010.

A short time later, the actress asked the officer and emergency medical personnel why they were 'making such a big deal' about applying a neck brace and putting her in an ambulance, Montgomery police officer William Wilkes told the court.

'She said we were being overly dramatic,' said Officer  Wilkes. 'I said, "The reason I’m making such a big deal is because you were just in a severe two-car collision."'

'After they had taken a blood sample, at some point she said, "Am I pregnant or am I just drunk?"' Officer Wilkes told the court.

He also recalled that, in the hours following the crash, Locane-Bovenizer urinated in her hospital bed, rambled incoherently and at times seemed unaware of what had just occurred.

Officer Wilkes was the second officer to arrive at the crash scene after the emergency call was made at 9.16pm where he found Locane-Bovenizer sitting upright in the nearby ditch.

'Her clothes were a little messed up, dirty,' he recalled to the court. 'Her eyes were bloodshot and watery, her speech was a little slurred.'

He added that the actress was 'happy giggling laughing' when he found her and alleged that during the ambulance ride she told emergency personnel that she had consumed four glasses of wine and a beer.

In the hospital emergency room, he told the court that Locane-Bovenizer asked several times what had happened to her sport utility vehicle.

When Officer Wilkes answered her, he said, 'She kind of acknowledged it and a couple minutes later it would be like that conversation never happened, almost.'

Locane-Bovenizer eventually asked, 'I’m sorry, am I getting a DWI?' Officer  Wilkes added.

The mother-of-two is married to liquor store owner Mark Bovenizer.

Despite the seriousness of the incident, her attorney previously  told website TMZ  that he was 'surprised' at the aggravated manslaughter charge.

'I don't believe it is supported by the law or the facts and I think it constitutes over-reaching by the prosecutor's office,' said Mr Zwillman.
