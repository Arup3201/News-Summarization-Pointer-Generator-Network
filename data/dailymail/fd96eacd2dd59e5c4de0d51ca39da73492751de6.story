A community left devastated after an eight-month-old boy was allegedly beaten to death by his mother's boyfriend have rallied together to buy the baby a tombstone.

Residents in the small community in Salem, Indiana have raised hundreds of dollars so that Leelan Crain, who was allegedly beaten on September 7, can be remembered.

The little boy was allegedly killed by his mother's live-in boyfriend, 24-year-old Jamie Lykins, who has since been charged with battery resulting in death and neglect of a dependent.

He had initially claimed that Leelan had fallen off the bed and sustained a head injury when the boy's mother, 23-year-old Casey Crain, found her son unresponsive while he was taking a nap.

Killed: Leelan Crain, pictured, was unresponsive in his crib after he was beaten and died just hours later

Crain and Lykins took him to St. Vincent's Hospital in Salem and he was airlifted to Kosair Children's Hospital, where he was 
pronounced dead in the early hours of the next morning.

An
autopsy was performed hours later at the Kentucky Medical Examiner's 
Office in Louisville and preliminarily determined the cause of death as 
blunt force 
trauma to the head.

Police
said Lykins had told the babysitter, who arrived after the incident: 
'We have a problem. I beat the [expletive] out of baby LeeLee,' 
according to an earlier report from WDRB.

Crain was also later arrested and charged with neglect of a dependent.

She
insisted she did not know what had happened to her son, as she had not 
been in the room, but added: 'Jamie freaking beat him I guess,' WDRB reported.

Remembered: The neighborhood has rallied together to raise enough money to install a proper tombstone

'I hate him so much. I hope he gets what he deserves and I know he will,' she said.

The little boy currently has a small grave marker, but the community said this was just not enough and a new tombstone will soon be put at his gravesite.

Neighbor Yvonne Casey told WDRB: 'It is very sad, that's why we were pushing to pay for the 
headstone and his funeral and now we're in the works of getting a 
memorial bench.'

Casey is also helping to organize a vigil to remember Leelan, whom 'was abused neglected, murdered, and everybody turned a blind eye,' she said.

'We will fight for justice for you, Leelan,' she added.

The vigil, which includes a balloon release and a candle-lit ceremony, will be held next Friday at 7pm at the Crown Hill Cemetery.
