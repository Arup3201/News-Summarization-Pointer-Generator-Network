Mould in the ice, a fly infestation and food stored at unsafe temperatures.

It’s not the sort of health review you would expect for one of New York’s most pricey restaurants at the Ritz-Carlton on Central Park South.

But BLT Market was reportedly handed a ‘C’ grade in an inspection by the city’s health department - and it's on display in the front window.

It’s a dramatic fall for the expensive eatery - labelled as one of the city’s ‘best new restaurants’ by New York Magazine in February 2008.

It scored just 77 in June - although this was later reduced to 67, reported the New York Post. A score of 28 or more is considered a 'flunk'.

Zagat gave the restaurant a ‘very good to excellent’ rating and it received four stars from Time Out magazine in October 2007.

‘I have eaten here before and liked it very much, but now I would not eat here,’ Melissa Dalton, of Queens, New York, told the New York Post.

Steve Bickley, who is visiting the hotel from England, said he won't be going as the restaurant is far too expensive to have a poor inspection.

Another tourist from South Carolina said the rating ‘taints’ BLT Market and it will stop her going too.

However manager Scott Geraghty denied he runs a dirty restaurant and said he is hoping for a re-inspection soon.

Mr Geraghty said the restaurant cares deeply about its customers and is now just waiting for the health department to return.

‘The health department came in a while ago and we took all their suggestions and made all the improvements,’ he told the New York Post.

The most expensive dish on the BLT Market menu is a Roasted Four Story Hill Veal Chop dish at $47 - before tax and any tip is applied.

The restaurant’s wine list includes an 1870 bottle of Pauillac wine from  France, which retails at more than $11,000.
