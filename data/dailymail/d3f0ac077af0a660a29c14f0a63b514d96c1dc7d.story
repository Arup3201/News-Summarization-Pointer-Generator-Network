The contest was effectively over before it began. 

With two minutes and 39 seconds on the clock, Shakhtar Donetsk defender Olexandr Kucher received the quickest red card in Champions League history before Thomas Muller converted the resulting penalty.

The 10 men never stood a chance as Bayern Munich sauntered into the quarter-finals at the Allianz Arena.

Jerome Boateng added a second for the German champions in the first half before Franck Ribery, Muller, Holger Badstuber, Robert Lewandowski and Mario Gotze completed the rout.

Shakhtar had held Bayern to a hugely credible goalless draw in Donetsk three weeks ago but, knowing that an away goal in Bavaria could prove crucial, got off to the worst start possible. 

Mario Gotze burst into the Shakhtar penalty area after he being released by Franck Ribery's slick first time pass before Kucher went to ground. The contact was minimal but enough to fell the World Cup-winner.

Muller made no mistake from 12 yards after the defender had harshly been brandished with a red card. The hosts had to wait 30 minutes before doubling the lead as Robert Lewandowski, who should have scored, hit the post before Andriy Pyatov denied Ribery with a smart stop.

But the Ukrainian outfit's resistance was finally broken again on 34 minutes. Former Manchester City defender Boateng tapped home from a yard out after Pyatov had saved at Lewandowski's feet.

Ribery added a third for the home side on 49 minutes after exchanging passes with David Alaba before firing a crisp effort past Pyatov from a tight angle.

It was to be five in the 63rd minute when Holger Badstuber powered a free header past Pyatov, who got a hand on the effort, after a cross whipped in by Rafinha.

Lewandowski made it six with 15 minutes left after breaking clear of the Shakhtar backline before applying a cool finish and Gotze rounded off an impressive performance with a goal of his own in the 87th minute as Bayern eased into the last eight.
