Off the hook: John Christopher Lo was arrested in 2010 for sending sexually-explicit text messages and pictures to a former student of his, but likely won't face prosecution with the Texas Court of Appeals ruling

The highest court in Texas has ruled that while it's illegal to engage in sexual activities with a minor, it's OK to talk about it with them.

State lawyers who argued in favor of keeping the 2005 statute said that without it 'perverts will be free to bombard our children with salacious emails and text messages, and parents and law enforcement would be unable to stop it'.

But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled unanimously that the law is in violation of the First Amendment right to free speech.

State laws are able to limit the First Amendment right to free speech but only if they serve a compelling state interest and are narrowly drawn to limit their impact.

In her opinion, Judge Cathy Cochran, explained that the law met the compelling state interest in protecting children from child predators.

But the law wasn't narrowly written enough and instead covered 'a whole cornucopia of "titillating talk" or "dirty talk," including sexually explicit literature such as "Lolita," "50 Shades of Grey," "Lady Chatterley's Lover" and Shakespeare's "Troilus and Cressida."'

Judge Cochran listed other examples 
of 'sexually explicit television shows, movies and performances' that 
would be illegal under the law, such as Janet Jackson's 2004 Super Bowl 
performance in which she exposed her right breast, and Miley Cyrus' 
recent appearance on the 2013 Video Music Awards.

Unconstitutional: The Court of Appeals ruled that the 2005 statute was in violation of the First Amendment right to free speech. They said it was too general and could be applied to books like '50 Shades of Grey' (left) and Miley Cyrus' recent VMA performance (right)

'In sum, everything (the law) prohibits and punishes is speech and is either already prohibited by other statutes - such as obscenity, disturbing harmful materials to minors, solicitation of a minor, or child pornography - or is constitutionally protected,' she wrote.

One man probably celebrating the ruling is former-teacher John Christopher Lo of Harris County, Texas who was arrested in 2010 after sending sexual text messages and pictures to a former student.

Lo's attorney, Mark Bennett, believes the 53-year-old is now off the hook. The court dismissed a pending indictment against Lo in their decision. His trial had been delayed while the law's constitutionality was challenged.

'Parents have the job of dealing with this. This is not the government's job,' Bennett told the Houston Chronicle. 'Keep track of who your kids are communicating with and teach your kids what's appropriate and what's not.'
