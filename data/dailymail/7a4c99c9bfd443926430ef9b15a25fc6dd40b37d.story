Whether she’s strutting her stuff on the catwalk or posing for yet another selfie, Cara Delevingne is undoubtedly comfortable in her own skin and never afraid to go make-up free.

But a hectic modelling schedule and infamous late night partying antics must take its toll on her skin.

And now, FEMAIL can reveal the £180 treatment that helps keep her supermodel skin in check.

So THAT's her secret! Cara has £180 111 SKIN Micropen Facials at 111 Harley Street to keep her complexion fresh

21-year-old Cara is a huge fan of 111 SKIN Micropen Facials at 111 Harley Street, which she indulges in regularly.

The 111SKIN Micropen Facial involves three key stages. First, a therapist cleanses and massages Cara's face using intensive 111SKIN products.

The vital stage of the facial, which claims to give Cara that catwalk glow, is achieved with the Dermapen, an electric micro-needling device used to combat pigmentation, fine lines, open pores and uneven skin tone.

The micro pen works with the skin’s natural repair system by making tiny punctures to stimulate cell regeneration, but is gentle enough for use around the delicate eye area. When the needles enter the skin, there is a tingling sensation - but no real pain, apparently.

After microneedling is complete, the 111SKIN Bio Cellulose Face Mask is applied to Cara's skin to soothe and hydrate, followed by a revitalising neck and shoulder pressure point massage.

Cara, who is currently busy juggling modelling, musical and acting careers, is a fan of the treatment because it only takes an hour, so she can pop in on a lunch break.

Cara is currently filming Kids In Love, as well as The Face Of An Angel, a film which touches upon the murder of British student Meredith Kercher and the trial of Amanda Knox.

Over the weekend she joined showbiz friend Miley Cyrus in Amsterdam where the pair made a late-night stop at a famed Amsterdam coffee shop, according to witnesses.

The
 friends allegedly sat down down just after 11pm and emerging two hours looking quite relaxed
 despite the camera presence outside.
