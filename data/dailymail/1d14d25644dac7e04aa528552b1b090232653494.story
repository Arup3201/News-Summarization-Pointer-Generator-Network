A student was jailed for three years for declaring himself an atheist on Facebook in Egypt

An Egyptian court has sentenced a student to three years in jail for 'contempt of Islam' after he admitted being an atheist on Facebook.  

Karim al-Banna, a 22-year-old engineering undergraduate, was arrested in November in the Nile delta city of Idku and jailed on Saturday. 

It follows a crackdown by the military government on 'immoral behaviour'. 

Mr Banna's neighbours read the Facebook post and invited him to talk about it at a café, where they secretly called the police, according to Fatma Serag, a lawyer with the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression which is representing the student.  

Another lawyer Abdel Nabi said his client's father testified against his son during the trial as he 'was embracing extremist ideas against Islam'. 

Atheism is not illegal but Mr Banna was found guilty of insulting the Muslim faith under the Egyptian penal code which criminalises defamation of the three recognised religions of Islam, Christianity and Judaism. 

His sentence could be suspended until a verdict is issued by the appeals court if he pays bail of £93.

The case follows a steady rise in 'contempt of religion' cases since the overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood

Massive protests across Egypt against President Morsi's rule led to his ousting in July 2013

There has been an increase in 'contempt of religion' cases since the Muslim Brotherhood and President Mohamed Morsi were overthrown.

In December 2012, 27-year-old blogger Alber Saber was sentenced to three years in jail on charges of blasphemy. 

And last June, a Coptic Christian man was sentenced to six years in jail for insulting Islam. 

Fatma Naoot, a writer, is standing trial after allegedly criticising the traditional slaughter of sheep during the Muslim holiday of Eid, while the poet Karim Saber was jailed last year for his short story collection entitled Where is God.

The military-backed authorities have stepped up measures to prove they are more Islamic than the previous regime they brought down during the Arab Spring.
