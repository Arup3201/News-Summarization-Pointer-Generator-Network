The father of a British teacher who was raped and murdered in Japan has pleaded to the judge in her killer's trial to pas the maximum sentence available.

Linsay Hawker, 22, died trying to escape her captor after an horrific 17-hour ordeal during which she was raped, battered and choked to death.

Her father Bill Hawker, who was called as a witness at Tokyo's Chiba District Court, appealed directly to the judge during the trial.

He told the court how proud the family had been of her going to Japan to teach English and said her killer Tatsuya Ichihashi should be shown 'no mercy' as he had shown none for his daughter.

Ichihashi, 32, has pleaded guilty to charges of rape, unlawfully disposing of a body and causing injury resulting in death which carry a sentence of between three and twenty years.

But he denies denies murder, a crime which carries the death penalty in the country.

Miss Hawker, from Brandon, Warwickshire, was found dead in a bath filled with sand at Tatsuya Ichihashi's flat, east of Tokyo, in March 2007

Ichihashi wept as he described to the court how he had tied Ms Hawker's hands and feet with plastic loops and raped her in the hallway.

While the prosecution maintains he had then strangled her, he claims he spent several hours talking to his victim in a bizzare attempt to make up for his actions.

He told the court: 'I was trying to make up for it and create some kind of relationship with her so that she would eventually forgtive me.'

His defence team claims he had tried to revive Miss Hawker and that he had strangled her to prevent her crying out for help and should face a lesser charge of inflicting injury, causing death.

He said: 'I gradually became frustrated with her, because I thought she wanted to use any means to escape.

'I punched her in the face twice ... I thought that I'd done something really terrible again. But I thought that I can't let her go now as I've punched her as well as raped her.

'But somehow I wanted her to forgive me.'

He told the court he had woken up at 3am to discover that Ms Hawker had managed to free her wrists.

He added: 'She was screaming. She was trying to escape.

'I was trying to cover her mouth with my left hand because I thought she might disturb the neighbours.'

Under the Japanese legal system the Hawkers are classed as 'victim participants' and will be able, at the discretion of the court, to question the defendant and give their opinion on sentencing.

They will also be able, for example, to ask to examine the prosecution evidence.

In January Ichihashi promised to donate the proceeds of a book in which he confessed to the killing to Miss Hawker's family.

It detailed how he spent two and a half years on the run following the murder and how he used false identities and underwent plastic surgery to change his appearance.

Ichihashi has also apologised to Miss Hawker's family, claiming he wrote the book as 'a gesture of contrition for the crime I committed'.

He doesn't describe the crime or his motives in the book, titled Until the Arrest, instead detailing his life at large, during which he traveled up and down the country, in constant fear of arrest and obsessed with cosmetic surgery.

It tells how he scissored off his lower lip, dug two moles out of his cheek with a box cutter and even gave himself a nose job in an attempt to obscure his identity.

He also claimed to have embarked on a pilgrimage tour of temples on the south-western island of Shikoku, wishing Miss Hawker could 'come back to life'.

He was finally arrested in Osaka while waiting for a ferry to Okinawa.

The Japanese court, in Chiba, will work in much the same way as the English system, Kenichi Kinukawa, the lawyer representing the family, said.

On the first day of the trial the defendant heard the charges and gave his plea to the allegations.

The major differences with the UK courts are the victim participation system and the saiban-in (lay judge) jury system.

The lay judge system sees members of the public selected to participate in the most serious trials, working together with professional judges to determine guilt or innocence and sentence.

The verdict in the case is expected to be given on July 21. The trial continues.
