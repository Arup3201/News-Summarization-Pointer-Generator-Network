A toddler was left behind in the woods by nursery school staff after they took a group of children on a walk, it emerged today.

Fordfield House Nursery has apologised unreservedly after the shocking failing in care was revealed in an Ofsted report.

The youngster was only returned to the nursery - which caters for children under the age of five - after being found by someone from a nearby riding stables.  

Failing in care: A toddler was left behind in the woods by Fordfield House Nursery during a class outing

After the incident last December staff at the nursery in Ampthill, Bedfordshire, notified the inspector that a 'serious incident' had occurred.

It is believed the child, whose age and gender is unknown, was left behind in woodland at the end of the trip to the woods. 

The nursery has stopped all outings until new policies are brought in - including giving staff new mobile phones. 

Ofsted would not confirm how the child came to be left behind but their report states they issued 'compliance action'.

This included a 'notice to improve' which asked the nursery to 'ensure children are kept safe on outings'.

A welfare requirements notice was also serves which states the nursery must 'ensure staffing arrangements meet the needs of all children and ensure their safety'.

It also states that they must 'ensure that children are adequately supervised and decide how to deploy staff to ensure children's needs are met'.

It also asked them to 'identify the steps to be taken to remove, minimise and manage[...] risks and hazards'.

Ofsted said it had also carried out a further inspection into the nursery and a report would be published 'in due course'.

The report, which was published last month, said: 'The owner took immediate action following the incident.

'All outings have been stopped until relevant policies and procedures have been amended and fully implemented within the nursery.

'New mobile phones that will be used on outings have been purchased. We are satisfied with the action taken by the provider. The provider remains registered with Ofsted.'

The nursery was in fact rated outstanding by Ofsted after an inspection last July and its director, Carole Cross, said parents had been 'kept fully informed'.

She said: 'We made our parents and Ofsted fully aware at that time and they rigorously inspected the nursery and investigated.

'We complied and worked with the inspection team immediately and, as a result, we have put improved and effective changes in place to make our nursery even better than it was.

'We have apologised unreservedly to our parents.'

A nursery spokesman said: 'The incident was last year and it has been fully investigated by Ofsted.' 

A mother who has three children at the nursery said: 'I believe that the incident should not define what is a wonderful establishment.

'The nursery responded in the appropriate way and rather than dwell, they have put measures in place to stop any such incident - a direct result of human error - from happening again.

'I only hope that this does not mean an end to the wonderful walks in the woods that my children have enjoyed with nursery over the last eight years.'
