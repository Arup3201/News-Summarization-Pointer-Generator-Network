What did the Benefits Street star do when she was asked to do stand-up?

She stuck her hand out.

And that's what happened when White Dee was asked to do a routine in her home city of Birmingham.

Comic turn: White Dee, real name Deirdre Kelly, from the Channel 4 documentary Benefits Street, outside her home on James Turner Street in Birmingham

It didn't all go to plan for the mother-of-two though, on the night four other comedians made her the butt of their jokes.

One even cracked even cracked a joke about the jobless 42-year-old having 'the ambition and drive of a Fiat Punto'.

But the Channel 4 star - whose real name Deirdre
 Kelly -  took the abuse in good heart and gave back as good as she got.

She spent four hours on stage in front of 400 people at the £17.50-a-head event.

During that time Ms Kelly, who appeared for free, cracked jokes about her life on handouts, The Sun reported.

She told the crowd: 'I thought I'd just come up here and sit on a chair - just like I do all day long anyway.'

White Dee received some friendly abuse when she did stand-up, but took it all in good heart

Speaking about having to leave her children at home, she quipped: 'It's tough being a working mum.'

Maureen Younger said: 'She's the queen of Benefits Street. She's got the ambition and drive of a Fiat Punto.'

She told comedian and former MTV host Richard Blackwood, 42: 'I used to really fancy you. I'd give you a good going over.'

Talking about burglaries in her street, Miss Kelly said: 'People obviously think I'm still skint, my house is fine.'

Afterward she told a fan: 'It was great making people laugh. Most of the other comedians were rubbish.'

Miss Kelly, who is rumoured to have 
had some of her benefits frozen after it emerged she was being paid to 
do promotional work, has been receiving around £20,000 a year in welfare
 payments.

The single mother angered taxpayers after insisting she would continue claiming handouts until the Government stops her. 

Last month it emerged she had turned down four job opportunities, claiming they were 'too boring' among other excuses.

After
 being given trial runs at four potential careers near her home in 
Birmingham, the 42-year-old declined to pursue any of them.

She is reported to be receiving £214 a
 week from a combination of Employment and Support Allowance - formerly 
known as incapacity benefit - child tax credit and child benefit, plus 
£500 a month in housing benefit.

Miss Kelly said she does feel guilty 
about claiming handouts, maintaining it is her depression that has 
stopped her from taking on full-time roles.
