Any changes from the Italy game?

Martin Keown: I’d be quite happy 
to go with the same team. Yes there’s debate over Rooney but they are 
only starting positions on paper. It’s good to have somebody starting 
wide who wants to play more centrally. You just shouldn’t restrict him. 
Give him and Sterling freedom to roam relative to each other.

Jamie Redknapp: I’m fed up with it and Wayne Rooney must be fed up with it: there should be no debate over where he plays, he’s got to play through the middle. Uruguay will have a second-string right back (Jorge Facile replacing the suspended Maxi Pereira) so put Raheem Sterling out wide, tell him to fill his boots and let Wayne play in his best position.

Tricky: Raheem Sterling should target the replacement right-back when England play Uruguay on Thursday

How will this game be won?

Martin Keown: Wayne Rooney holds the key, but I’d like to see more inspiration from him. He makes good contributions but has become a bit conservative. I want him to unleash that brilliance because it’s there bubbling under the surface.

Jamie Redknapp: It’s going to be very tight. Uruguay can’t play any worse but can England play any better than they did against Italy? Uruguay are weak at the back and will sit deeper than Italy did. England will have to be patient because I don’t think Uruguay will leave much space in behind.

Pivot: Wayne Rooney holds they key for the crucial World Cup game... wherever he plays

How do they stop Suarez?

Jamie Redknapp: When a player is as unpredictable as he is, it’s hard to know the answer! If you stick tight, he turns you, if you stand off, he runs through you and if you double up, that  leaves Edinson Cavani spare. You’ve just got to stay on your feet and not give him a chance to go over. Don’t be surprised if he’s at the heart of some controversy.

Martin Keown: Sitting on the bench against Costa Rica, his knee still looked puffy so he can’t be 100 per cent fit. But you always have to expect the unexpected with him. He gets through seemingly impossible gaps so, as a defender, you have to concentrate. We’ve listened all season to how good he is. Now is their chance to stop him.

Master: Luis Suarez is difficult to stop... but it is by no means impossible

Unfit: Suarez is coming back from knee surgery... as his scar here shows

Biggest lesson from Italy?

Martin Keown: England played well but there is a lot to be learned from the Italians about how to take the sting out of games. They very professionally saw the game out and England need to show a similar calmness and not get anxious.

Jamie Redknapp: I don’t think there are any major lessons but you have to play players in their best positions. I think Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson could do a bit more to orchestrate the game in the middle and make us play.

Disappointing: Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson need to improve from their Italy performance

Advice for the players in a do-or-die game?

Jamie Redknapp: There’s so much experience in that dressing room. I wouldn’t want to tell them to do this or that. But they have to be patient. 

Martin Keown: The pressure is huge but the England players still need to enjoy themselves. You can’t play the occasion, you have to play the man in front of you.

Pass and move: England need to keep calm and play their natural game

Where will you watch?

Martin Keown: By kick-off I think that I will have travelled about 10,000 miles around Brazil! But I’ll be in Natal watching on.

Jamie Redknapp: I’ll be at home with my two boys cheering on England from the sofa.

What does the word ‘Uruguay’ mean to you?

Jamie Redknapp: Technically good but extremely volatile. They can get spiteful and it would be no surprise to see plenty of cards in the game.

Martin Keown: Footballing pedigree. They won the first ever World Cup and upset Brazil in the final at the Maracana in 1950. For such a small country, they have a rich football history.

Pedigree: Uruguay stunned Brazil in the Maracana in 1950

Who is your all-time favourite Uruguay star?

Martin Keown: I’m not sure about a favourite but Diego Forlan certainly wasn’t in my good books in 2004 when he won a penalty off me in the Battle of Old Trafford!

Jamie Redknapp: I remember watching Enzo Francescoli at the World Cup in 1986 and he was a brilliant playmaker. He became a bit of a midfield idol for me.

Foul? Diego Forlan wasn't in Martin Keown's good books after the Battle of Old Trafford in 2004...

In one word, why should England be optimistic?

Jamie Redknapp: Defence. Not ours, theirs. It’s a weak point that can be exploited.

Martin Keown: Superiority. We are better than them. Simple.

Hope: Roy Hodgson needs to believe England are better than Uruguay

Prediction?

Martin Keown: It won’t be easy but England have the quality – 2-0.

Jamie Redknapp: I’m expecting a real battle and it will be very tight, but England to win 2-1.
