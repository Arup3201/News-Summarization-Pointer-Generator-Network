She built a brand around her glamorous image but Katie Price has revealed that as she prepares to make a comeback after two pregnancies, she's embracing a new look.

Katie, 36, who gave birth to her fifth child in August, told MailOnline that she is excited to get back to work after two pregnancies in the past two years.

She said: 'Obviously I have been pregnant for two years so I am looking forward to getting back to work. I can’t wait to do more photoshoots, it’s where I started and what I do best, I miss them but I want to do proper styled shoots, themed ones, that are sexy.'

She's back! Katie Price has been busy raising her family but says the next year is looking positive and is packed with lots of exciting plans, including a baby range and autobiography 

As she prepares to unveil her 2015 calendar, which she promises will be 'sexy but tastefully done', Katie is dyeing her hair and adopting a natural look. 

Speaking about her current beauty regime, she said: ‘Beauty-wise, I haven’t changed my routine since having a baby. I don’t think being pregnant is an excuse to let yourself go. I don’t wear makeup, I never have.

‘I believe the art of looking good is a nice subtle spray tan on your face, I like that look, plucked and tinted eyebrows, and a manicure and pedicure. I always have those treatments.' 

She is also the global ambassador for ColourB4’s, a natural colour remover that claims to work by reversing the colouring process, shrinking the colour molecules along with any toxins trapped inside the hair.

Au natural: Katie says that, beauty-wise, she hasn't changed her routine since having a baby. 'I don't think being pregnant is an excuse to let yourself go. I don't wear makeup, I never have,' she said

Beauty ambassador: Kate is  the global ambassador for ColourB4's new One Hour Makeover campaign, and wants to inform women that they can be the hair colour they want to be in just one hour

Speaking about her new role, she said: 'With this ColourB4 product I can keep changing my hair colour, I am having so much fun with it, I’ve never changed it so much. The aim of the campaign is to inform women that they can be the hair colour they want to be in just one hour.

‘I’m brunette now and it's a total myth that blondes have more fun but I'm changing my colour again after my book tour in the Isle of Wight next week.'

When asked if there's a particular celebrity's look that she admires, Katie said: ‘It’s normal to see celebrities wearing loads of make-up, they always look immaculate. 

'I think the real test is to see what they look like in the morning. Anyone can look good with makeup on. Then again, they could look good without makeup but the paps would never release those pictures.'

Katie has been displaying a trim post-baby body and it may well be thanks to her personal trainer partner Kieran Hayler, the father of newborn daughter Bunny.

Healthy couple: Katie and Kieran, who welcomed daughter Bunny this year, eat lots of healthy salads at home but treat themselves to takeaways every Friday

Speaking about her partner's positive influence on her diet, she said: ‘I don’t take any supplements for my hair and skin, I don’t like taking tablets but Kieran takes a lot of vitamins. 

'I believe in eating healthily and I eat a lot better now. Kieran makes delicious salads for me, I never knew how to make them before and they always tasted so bland but he is really into health and fitness so knows what works.

'I love making traditional British dishes like shepherds pie and cottage pie, I don’t like chocolate, I am more into savoury treats.

‘We are very traditional, every Friday we have an Indian and on Sunday we have roast lamb.' 

Now that she's rekindled her relationship with Kieran, Katie is focussing on family and her career.

Speaking about her future plans, she said: ‘I'm releasing a novel next week and my autobiography next year. I’ve got a perfume coming out, a baby range, and my KP equestrian range.

‘I am looking forward to getting back to work. The next year is looking good for me, I can’t wait. I’ve moved house, it’s a fresh start and I am eager to get back to doing what I do best: working.'

Author: Katie has also penned a 'novel', which is out next week. She has also been writing an autobiography; the tome will hit shelves next year

Katie is the ambassador for ColourB4 available from Superdrug and Boots.
