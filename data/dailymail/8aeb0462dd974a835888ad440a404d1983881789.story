If you're in the market for a 10 bedroom, 10 bathroom terrace house with just one kitchen and an industrial laundry in the heart of Sydney's Kings Cross - you're in luck.

A unique terrace at 52 Kellett Street, Potts Point has just been listed for sale with a price guide of more than $1.8 million.

The 171 square metre property is being marketed as a 'grand terrace zoned for residential and commercial' use and is currently occupied by a brothel known as Secret Desire.

There is no mention of the brothel in advertising for the sale of the property but the 'iconic address' has 'boundless scope and future promise'.

The terrace is complete with soaring ornate ceilings, arched hallways and original fixtures.

It's being sold through McGrath Estate Agents Chris Helich and Peter Starr.

The property failed to sell when it was listed for three months in April 2013 for $1.98 million.

'Brothels are all along Kellett St,' Raine & Horne Commercial selling agent Luke Smith told the Daily Telegraph when it was listed last time.

The property sold for $2.1 million in 2006, $1.5 million in 2004, $1.4 in 1999 and just $90,000 in 1979.

The terrace has 10 bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, a kitchen and industrial laundry
