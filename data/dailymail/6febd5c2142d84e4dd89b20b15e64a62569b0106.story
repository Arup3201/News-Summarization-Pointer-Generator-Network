At the helm of his 16ft  catamaran, Glenn Crawley has been riding the waves  for almost a decade – to the utter frustration of his local sailing community.

Now he has well and truly earned the nickname Captain Calamity after the RNLI was called out to rescue him for the 15th time.

Mr Crawley, described as a ‘bloody menace’ by one harbour master, is believed to have run up costs of almost £40,000 for the charity after repeatedly flipping his boat while pursuing his hobby – or ‘pushing the boundaries of sailing’, as he puts it.

Spot of bother: When the wind dropped Mr Crawley was left bobbing on the water for around 40 minutes

He has been forced to make a series 
of SOS calls and members of the public or sailors who see him 
floundering often dial 999 to get help – costing the RNLI £2,500 every 
time they are called out to him.

Mr Crawley’s latest episode happened 
near his home town of Newquay, Cornwall, on Monday, when he decided to 
set sail in some of the worst weather of the winter.

He became stuck floating 100 yards 
from the beach after winds dropped but the RNLI were soon at the scene 
offering to tow him to shore.

After refusing their help but failing
to get moving again, Mr Crawley  capsized the £1,500 catamaran and 
hauled it back to the beach.

Andy Brigden, Cornwall Council’s 
maritime manager, said: ‘Obviously he’s got this Captain Calamity 
nickname for a reason – it’s richly deserved. The RNLI are all 
volunteers, they all have better stuff to do with their time, but they 
will respond to it because that’s what they do.

‘I would urge people to sail within the limits of their competence.’

Mr Crawley, a 56-year-old father of 
one, began sailing in 2003 and was forced to dial 999 three times that 
year. In 2007 he was rescued four times in four hours after he flipped 
his boat, and three years later he wrecked his old boat – aptly called 
‘Mischief’ – trying to ride Cornwall’s giant Cribbar wave.

But he has no plans to hang up his 
wetsuit. Explaining his latest error, the retired electrician said: ‘It 
would have been much easier for me to grab a rope but it’s my little 
adventure and I feel it has to involve an element of risk.

‘The problem the RNLI have is that if
some granny walking along the cliffs calls them saying I’m in danger, 
they have to act on it. They’re not thrilled about it and neither am I.

‘My boat has been in mortal danger many times but that’s replaceable. I’m not in danger.

‘I know what I do is a little bit 
different but it’s my way of being in tune with nature. If you ain’t got
adventure in your life, you ain’t got nothing.’

An RNLI spokesman said they would continue to respond to all mayday calls.
