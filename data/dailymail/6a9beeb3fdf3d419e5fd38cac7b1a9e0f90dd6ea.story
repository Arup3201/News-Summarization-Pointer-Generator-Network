Prince William said he was nearly moved to tears after watching Steven Prescod, 22, perform and asked the young man to contact him

They have visited the White House, watched basketball with Jay-Z and Beyonce, and rubbed shoulders with creme-de-la-creme of New York high society.

But the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge said today that the best event on their New York tour was watching a former hoodlum perform a one-man show in a youth center in Brooklyn.

Prince William said he was nearly moved to tears while watching playwright and actor Steven Prescod, 22, recount his life story, and offered to help him bring his show to London's West End.

At the end of the performance the prince, who left New York with pregnant wife Kate last night after three days in the city, even handed Prescod his number, telling him to 'reach out'.

Prescod performed extracts from his play Brooklyn Boy for the Royals, including music, dance, and a powerful monologue, recounting his early life.

Born to a 15-year-old mother, Prescod's father went to jail when he was just one year old.

He avoided a seven-year jail sentence himself for assault and battery by opting for five years' probation when he started working with the CityKids Foundation who helped bring his story to life. 

According to The Mirror, Prince William, 32, told Prescod: 'We want more. That was amazing. We should get you on in the West End. 

'All I can say is, it was really impressive. It nearly had me in tears.'

Prescod added: 'He told me that he really wanted to help me put the show on. He said he's been the Barclays Center last night to watch the basketball but he'd pay to see this a million times.

After the performance, William said the event was the best thing he had done during his three-day tour of New York which included meeting with the Clintons and watching basketball with Jay-Z and Beyonce

William and Kate also took a tour of The Door project where the performance took place, suggesting a collaboration with their own Royal Foundation back in the UK

'It's all about my own life. I didn't really learn about writing. I didn't have to learn about developing characters because I used my own experiences.'

William and Kate visited The Door community center in Lower Manhattan yesterday afternoon and were shown a sample of the work they do with disadvantaged youngsters.

The organisation works with young people aged 12-24, helping 10,000 every year and provides services free of charge. 

The Royals watched Prescod perform alongside 28 others, and were full of praise for the work that was being done.

Prince William also discussed a possible collaboration between The Door and CityKids Foundation and the Royal Foundation, which carries out similar work in the UK.

William said he was impressed with the confidence of the youngsters, saying it was something that young people in the UK struggled with, and suggested taking some of their techniques back home.

After visiting the youth center in Lower Manhattan the Royal couple spent the evening at a black tie event to help raise money for St Andrews University where they met and fell in love

The dinner, which cost up to $10,000-a-head, was to help raise money to pay for scholarships and bursaries at the University to help underprivileged people earn a place

After a dinner and speeches in the Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the couple went straight to the airport where they flew back to the UK

Before visiting the project, the Royal couple paid a solemn visit to the 9/11 memorial a short distance away, laying a wreath of white flowers.

After touring the adjoining museum, Kate said she had been left 'in awe' at the scale of the tragedy, adding that she had not anticipated how emotional the visit would be.

Their daytime schedule for Tuesday also included lunch with members of the British community, and a visit to the Empire State Building.

Yesterday evening the couple swapped Lower Manhattan for an elegant black tie event to help raise money for their Alma Mater: St Andrews University, where they met and fell in love.

the pair were the guests of honour at the lavish $10,000-a-head 600th anniversary event at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, the couple's final engagement of their three-day visit.

After a reception on the museum's Velez Blanco patio the couple were taken for dinner in the Temple of Dendur, a vast room decorated with statues of Egyptian gods that was built specifically to house an Egyptian temple built just before the birth of Christ. 

The sandstone temple was given to the U.S. in its entirety in 1965.

After a speech given by comedian Seth Myers, drafted in  last-minute after Tom Hanks pulled out for personal reasons, the Duke and Duchess were whisked straight to the airport for a flight home. 

Earlier in the day, before the youth center in Lower Manhattan, the couple paid a solemn visit to the 9/11 memorial and museum a short distance away

William and Kate laid a bunch of white flowers in front of the memorial, with Kate later saying that she had been 'in awe' of the site

Kate added she had been under-prepared for the emotional impact of visiting the 9/11 museum yesterday
