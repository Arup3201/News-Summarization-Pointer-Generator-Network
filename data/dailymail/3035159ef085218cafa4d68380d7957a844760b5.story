Charlotte Berry, 42, openly discussed being drunk and made jokes about how sexually attractive her colleagues were

An assistant headteacher at a secondary school is facing an investigation into her expletive-filled Twitter messages.

Followers of Charlotte Berry, 42, including fellow teachers and past pupils, saw Tweets which described lewd acts in bathrooms and her 'default mode' as 'lazy slut'.

Governors at The Billericay School, Essex, have now launched an inquiry into the use of obscene language on her Twitter page, under the username 'talktoteens', where she had 528 followers.

She also openly discussed being drunk and made jokes about how sexually attractive her colleagues were.

In one Tweet conversation 
she appears to be debating whether an unspecified swear word is still 
considered offensive. 

She tweeted: 'I don't even consider it a swear word any more - I keep saying it in class'.

Another Tweet read: 'well this day is shaping up. Warn you though, after 1 drink I say 'c***' a lot and after 2, I try to snog people.'

A message posted on Monday suggested that current pupils may follow her on Twitter.

It read: 'Traffic is preventing me from being at my only lesson today. Get on with coursework if you're listening.' 

She added: 'Oh and get me a Yorkie from vendors.' 

Mrs
 Berry, who described herself as a mother figure to the sixth form boys 
on her Twitter page, closed the account on Monday after the posts were 
exposed in a local newspaper.

Mrs Berry tweeted: Who wants to go and get p***** and her account is littered with expletives

School
 governor Peter Owen has said he will investigate the matter with the 
chairman of the board of governors, but added: 'I have got the greatest 
respect for Charlotte Berry. She is an excellent teacher and leader of 
innovation at the school.'

Mrs Berry, a mother who has taught
 at the school for 12 years, could also potentially face an 
investigation by the General Teaching Council for England, which 
regulates teachers' conduct.

The school declined to comment on whether Mrs Berry had been suspended.

In a statement to MailOnline, head of the 1,700 
pupil school Sue Hammond said: 'The school actively discourages staff and students from participating in social networking sites as statements are constantly taken out of context.

'The statements highlighted will, of course, be investigated fully and if necessary, action taken.  However, no complaints about Twitter activity have ever been received by the school.

'The member of staff’s Twitter account appears to have been individually targeted, accessing conversations with friends unconnected with the school and taken completely out of context.

'The school is saddened that the decision has been taken to print these individual unrelated comments, however indiscreet, in a newspaper medium to an audience for whom they were not intended.'

Mrs Berry declined to comment.
