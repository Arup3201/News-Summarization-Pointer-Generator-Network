Australians are being told to brace for a summer of early and devastating bushfires as  figures reveal half the country is at above average risk.

Two years of persistent droughts along the eastern states, coupled with a predicted hot spell for spring and summer, will bring the threat of bushfires forward for much of the eastern seaboard, South Australia and large parts of Western Australia.

A study published by the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre shows the regions at 'above normal' risk and the trending weather patterns increasing the bushfire threat.

The risk of bushfires across the country are highest along the eastern seaboard and Western Australia

An illustrated graphic showing the predicted fire threats show half of the nation faces an above normal risk.

In the east of Australia, the prevalence of fire is greatest in  NSW, Victoria and Queensland - a state which has been declared 75 per cent drought affected.

Above normal fire potential has been assessed for most of south east Queensland, from Biloela in the north west down to the NSW Border. 

Above average temperatures for NSW and Victoria, and very little rainfall on the horizon for either state could bring a fire season 'slightly more active than 2013-14,' the centre's data revealed.

In NSW, the state's coastal table lands and central slopes have been declared a high-fire danger, while in Victoria the central Wimmera and Malle regions are at risk.

Centre CEO Richard Thornton said densely populated zones in dry forested areas that have received little rain will be worse affected.

'The forested area in the east - that covers southern Queensland, most of eastern NSW and down through into Victoria - is largely driven by rainfall deficits over a long period of time,' centre CEO Richard Thornton said.

'That is leading to much higher than normal levels of potential for fire in the coming year.'  

Australians should brace for 'above normal' bushfire threats in large parts of the country

Bushfires could come earlier  than they did in 2013 - the warmest Australian year on record

Planning for the bushfire season can never start to early

He said it is unlikely that even big rain events like those experienced in Queensland and NSW in recent weeks will alter the outlook.

'We'll always get rainfall somewhere. What it will do is delay the onset a bit in general, but a few good, hot days will dry that out,' he said.

In Australia's less populated regions, higher-than-average rainfall has increased the  risk of grass fires on the Nullarbor Plain, in the mid-west and desert regions of Western Australia and South Australia's Eyre Peninsula.

'The south central parts of WA, through the midwest and the desert region, is dominated by a fairly wet period that has caused the grass to grow in this area.' 

Dr Thornton urged Australians to prepare now for the bushfire season.

'It's never too early to start to prepare,' he said. There is physical preparation that you can do and there is a bunch of other things you can do like your fire plans.

'Make sure you've got them written down, know what you are going to do if a fire threatens, no what your triggers are going to be.'

ACT: Strong winter grass growth, predicted above average spring temperatures and lower recent rainfall suggest above normal bushfire risk.

NSW: Well below average rain and warm temperatures to August drying heavy forest fuels but reducing grass growth. Dry, warm spring expected in south. Above normal fire conditions expected in the east.

QLD: Drought has curbed grass grown and grass fire risk but forest fuels are drying out. Above normal fire potential in much of southeast.

SA: Increased grass fire risk in parts of north west Pastoral, west coast, eastern and lower Eyre Peninsula, Flinders and mid-north with grass growth from above average rain. Likely longer fire season.

TAS: Above normal potential for fires expected only in Swansea/St Helens/Fingal region.

VIC: Above average fire risk expected in much of central, north and western Victoria. Early and slightly more active fire season than last summer expected.

WA: Low rain, dry soil and high fuel loads increases fire risk in southwest forests. Above average rain in the mid-west, south and desert regions produce higher grass fire potential.

A lack of rain and warm conditions will fuel bushfires along the east coast

@highlight

In WA, recent rain will provide fuel for the grass fires to burn increase

Experts have warned that fires are likely to start earlier than previous years

The research is contained in a regional bushfire report for Australia

The message to Australians is to prepare ahead of the bushfire threats
