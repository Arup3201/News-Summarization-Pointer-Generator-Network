Dani Alves says his new Barcelona team-mate Luis Suarez 'should not change' because the former Liverpool striker's aggressive style of play is part of his 'trademark' and 'personality'.

Suarez made the switch from Anfield to the Nou Camp for £75million during the summer, but must be patient to make his La Liga debut after being slapped with a four-month ban on all football-related activities for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup.

But Alves has urged the 27-year-old not to change, insisting it is what 'makes him different from everyone else'.

'I think that all things that happen to a person are part of a learning process,' says Alves.

'He knows where he comes from and what is the best he can do, but I recommend him not to change his personality. That is his trademark.

'He is a unique player who fights hard until the end for everything.

'Obviously, we should all have some level of self control. But I insist he shouldn't change the way he feels and faces this profession. That is what makes him different from everyone else.'

Suarez made his debut for Barcelona in a friendly 6-0 win over Mexican side Club Leon on Monday.

That came after the goalscorer's hefty ban was upheld, but relaxed to allow him to train and feature in friendly matches. Suarez wore the No 9 shirt and got the introduction he craved at the Nou Camp.
