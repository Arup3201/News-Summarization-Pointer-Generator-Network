A woman was arrested for marching into a police station, telling officers she was there 'to feed the pigs', then smearing raw meat around the station.

Lindsey McNamara, 24, allegedly smiled before dumping a Dunkin' Donuts box full of uncooked bacon and sausages onto the desk in front of a dispatcher's window at the station in Framingham, Massachusetts.

Officers say she then smeared the food onto the bulletproof glass in the Friday incident, before officers arrested her.

The bizarre act comes as police around the country are on high alert over potential attacks on officers, who are often termed 'pigs' as an insult.

Ismaaily Brinsley, the man who murdered two NYPD officers a week ago, used the term to insult police on social media, saying he was 'putting pigs in a blanket'. He later shot the two men dead.

McNamara appeared in court charged with malicious destruction of property, WBZ News reported.

In response to the charges she said 'God told me to come over there and feed the pigs', according to the news channel.

The judge postponed the rest of her trial in February, while her mental health is evaluated.

Regina McNamara, Lindsey's mother, later told reporters that her nursing student daughter is going through a 'difficult time'.

Lieutenant Harry Wareham told Boston.com: 'There’s a lot of unrest regarding law enforcement, and I don’t know if [this] is related or not,

'There’s probably a lot more productive ways to voice her displeasure with police.'

The incident follows an earlier court appearance from a man who allegedly wrote 'make pigs fly' on his Facebook, which was interpreted as a valid threat by local officers.
