The power of word association is amazing. 'Let's go away for the weekend to Paris,' I say one morning to my seven-year-old son, George. His little face lights up. 'Yes, dad!' he beams. 'Disneyland Paris!' 'No, not Disneyland,' I reply. 'Paris, Paris.' Suddenly, he's not so enthusiastic. Maybe the French capital isn't the most obvious destination for a long weekend with two young children.

Or is it? A new travel company reckons so. Kid & Coe specialises in privately owned rental properties, most of them in urban settings. The unique selling point being that the properties are both child-friendly and stylish.

Taking flight: A carousel in Paris, which is full of parks and rides that will entertain children

The company offers houses and apartments in Britain and across the world. Typically, you'll pay about £150 a night - so in most cases it's cheaper than staying in a hotel.

You have to make your own travel arrangements. We've come to Paris by train, which couldn't be easier or quicker, and are booked into the César residence in the 13th arrondissement.

A former artist's studio once owned by sculptor César Baldaccini - the man who designed the statuette (it's known as a César) that's awarded to film stars at the French equivalent of the Oscars - it costs about £270 a night. We're a family of four, but six people could sleep comfortably.

It's fabulous. White and high-ceilinged, with a galleried bedroom which opens onto the living room, there are framed portraits everywhere, and paint spatters on the tiny, twisty staircase.

The dining chairs are deliberately mismatched and a bit bashed. One is so orange and furry that I wonder if Fozzie Bear has been killed and skinned in order to create it. 

What's more, it's a real family home. It's only available to rent when the owners are out of town.

There's none of that antiseptic emptiness you sometimes find in holiday rental properties. Instead, there's all the family's stuff to use: toys, Lego, a telescope pointed at the stars.

We're in a totally untouristy neighbourhood, down a private alleyway, about 20 minutes by Metro from the most famous bits of the city. A recipe for boredom? As it turns out, not at all.

Yet, it all starts out badly. Our children have never been to Paris before, so we make the short journey to the Eiffel Tower, which we've been talking about for weeks.

But when we get there, the queue is 3½ hours long. Not worth the wait. Frankly, my wife and I are not too bothered. The children moan, but not for long. The best view of the tower itself is from the bottom, I tell them.

We grab some ice creams and crêpes, then go for a whirl on an imposing doubledecker carousel a few yards away, and spend an hour and a half on an open-top bus tour.

From the top deck, our children (not always the easiest to entertain), lap up their new surroundings - though the bus is shockingly expensive. They also lap up the playgrounds. Paris is awash with climbing frames, slides and swings.

There's a lovely local park - the Rene Le Gall - right near our apartment, with an amazing setup of twisty castle, pirate ship, swings etc. But town planners have also plonked swings and roundabouts all over the centre of town. There's some play equipment slap-bang next to the Notre Dame, for example. So it's very easy to do a bit of adult time, then a bit of child time.

Home from home: The Graff family stayed in a former artist's studio once owned by sculptor César Baldaccini

And that, I think, is the secret of the trip's success. Using neighbourhood parks - intended for local residents - is brilliant. As is the fact that our home comes with the family's bikes, scooters and French LPs.

The next day, in order not to miss out on a rooftop view of the city, we head to Montmartre. One of the highlights of the weekend, oddly, is a busker we encounter there, at the bottom of the funicular which goes up to the Sacre-Coeur at the top of the hill.

He blows huge, colourful bubbles above the children's heads. They leap for joy.

We eat well wherever we go: steak, duck, snails. All the favourites. Our four-year-old, Daisy, who won't let a tomato pass her lips at home, demands l'escargot at every restaurant. And when it's all over, I feel we've seen two sides of Paris. The world-famous bit aimed at visitors — and a glimpse of residential Paris. Not many tourists can claim to have experienced that combination.

The César Residence in Broca, Paris, costs from £270 a night including all fees, and sleeps up to six. Minimum stay is three nights (001 212 905 6065, kidandcoe.com). Return fares from London to Paris with Eurostar (08432 186 186, eurostar.com) start at £69.
