Air accident investigators have launched a formal inquiry into the emergency evacuation of a holiday jet after a smell of burning was reported in its cabin.

Passengers on board the Jet2 flight from Ibiza have claimed a strong smell of smoke caused panic aboard the Boeing 737 as it landed at East Midlands Airport.

Emergency crews based at the airport confirmed that no fire was found aboard the aircraft, which Jet2 said had developed a minor electrical fault.

A spokesman for East Midlands Airport said three other flights were diverted to Birmingham after the incident closed the airport for around 15 minutes.

Jet2 has declined to comment on reports that passengers opened a door on the aircraft after it touched down and left the fuselage by climbing on to a wing.

In a statement, the budget carrier said: 'Following a safe arrival at East Midlands Airport, flight LS644 from Ibiza had to be evacuated once on stand as a precautionary safety measure.

Panic: Passengers complained of a 'strong electrical burning smell' in the cabin and people were screaming

'We decided to disembark passengers as quickly as possible as a precautionary safety measure because a minor electrical problem led to some smoke in the cabin.

'All passengers were looked after by our airport team. A full investigation is now under way.'

Passenger Malcolm Yates, from Lincolnshire, described the smell of electrical burning as 'horrendous' and said it appeared to be coming from the rear of the plane.

He told BBC East Midlands Today: 'We just wanted the doors to open to get out.

Chaos: Some passengers climbed out on to the wing of the aircraft after it landed at East Midlands airport

'The panic set in and the kids started screaming. The stewardesses then took action and I knew we had to get off that plane quick.'

In a short statement, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said: 'The AAIB has deployed a team to investigate a serious incident to a commercial airliner that occurred at East Midlands Airport on the evening of Wednesday September 3.'

Following the emergency landing, a woman claimed her son managed to break a door and get out on to the wing of the plane.

Diane, who did not give her surname, was told about the drama by her son Greg who was aboard the plane with his girlfriend Julie.

The emergency landing also had knock-on effects for other passengers with at least three flights diverted

Diane said: 'There were lots of fire engines and ambulances on the tarmac waiting for it to land.

'Greg said to Julie 'we are in big trouble' and he said the smell of fire was vile, just dreadful.

'The crew wouldn't open the doors because they hadn't been given permission.

'Greg said some how or other he was going to open a door.

'He managed to open a door and he and Julie got out and jumped off the wing of the plane.

'There were lots of children and old people who were very, very frightened.

'It was chaos, everyone was running and screaming.' 

Adrian Pepper, 44, from Mickleover, said: 'As we came into land we aborted and had to pull back up and circle round again.

'When we came into land there was no communication as the PA system seemed to be broken.

'When we eventually landed we taxied down and we could see all the fire engines and ambulances.'

Mr Pepper said that they were forced to use the emergency exits to leave the plane and that an 'acrid smell of smoke' was evident as the left the plane.  

The emergency landing also had knock-on effects for other passengers with at least three flights diverted, according to the airport's website.

One of these aborted flights appeared to have been sent to Birmingham with Twitter user Maxine Sheppard writing: 

A Jet2 spokesperson said: 'Following a safe arrival last night at East Midlands Airport, flight LS644 from Ibiza had to be evacuated once on stand as a precautionary safety measure, due to a minor electrical problem which led to some smoke in the cabin.

'All passengers were looked after by our airport team. A full investigation is now under way.'

An airport spokesman said full safety procedures were followed.

Leicestershire Police confirmed that there was an aircraft emergency and that no one was injured.
