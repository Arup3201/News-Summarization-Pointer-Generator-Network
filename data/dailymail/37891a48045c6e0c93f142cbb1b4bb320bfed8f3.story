Cecilia Mortensen, 14, passed away on Saturday, after doctors removed life support Friday at Sutter Coast Hospital in Crescent City, California.

Cecilia had been pronounced brain dead earlier in the week, but doctors had reportedly kept her alive so they could harvest her organs for donation to those in need.

That process was completed on Friday, reports the San Francisco Chronicle.

New life: Cecilia Mortensen, 14, died at Sutter Coast Hospital in Crescent City, California Saturday. Her organs were donated to those in need

Shooter: Accused child molester Jerry Wayne Steele allegedly shot Cecilia Mortensen and her mother on July 14, before killing himself

Police say Cecilia was shot in the face on June 14 by Jerry Wayne Steele, 60, who was out on bail after being charged with molesting the 14-year-old at least four times over four years, starting in 2007.

Police say Steele also shot Cecilia's mother, Ashley Volore, 49, in the head.

She is recovering in an Oregon hospital and is expected to survive.

Beth Liles, a spokesperson for Sutter Coast Hospital, confirmed to MailOnline.com that Cecilia had been a patient, and that she died on Saturday.

Ms Liles would neither confirm nor deny any details of Cecilia's treatment or whether she had organs donated, citing patient confidentiality.

She said she was unaware of the details of any organ donation agreement, but said in the case of minors it is up to the parents to make the decisions.

Ms Volore and her daughter had moved to the Shangri-La trailer park in Crescent City, in northern California, seven weeks ago from Santa Clara County, which is in the Bay Area.

They reportedly moved to escape Steele and start a new life. They had a restraining order out against him.

Recovering: Ashley Volore, 49, is expected to recover, though her 14-year-old daughter Cecilia Mortenson has passed away, after her organs were donated

Police say after he shot his victims on June 14, he was found nearby, sitting in his rental car. When police approached, he shot himself in the head, then died.

Police say Steele was upset after he had learned he would spend the rest of his life in prison over a plea deal for his seven felony child molestation charges.

Steele, who was free on $250,000 bail, allegedly drove over 400 miles to seek out his victim and her mother and had been attempting to kidnap them.

Police said when the mother and daughter put up a struggle he shot them both in the head.

Authorities said Steele had begun molesting the girl when she was 10 years old.

She told police he took indecent photographs of her with his cell phone and the abuse would be carried out when he visited their home.

Police found the photo images on his phone when he was arrested.

The abuse was revealed in January after Cecelia became terrified when Steele held a razor to her throat.

She told her father who informed police.

Police say Steele tracked his victims to a trailer park in Crescent City, California, where they had hoped to start a new life

Steele, who lived with his mother and sister, was arrested on multiple sex abuse charges, which he denied.

Del Norte County Sheriff's Cmdr. Bill
Steven said investigators found a 'kidnap kit' in a duffel bag in the 
backseat of Steele's car that included night-vision goggles, a stun gun,
duct tape, rope and zip ties.

Steele also had flowers and a teddy bear in the car, Mr Steven said.

'We
aren't sure if he was going to use them to lure (the victims) or to 
keep them calm', Mr Steven said. 'This wasn't a crime of passion as much
as it was a thought-out kidnapping'.
