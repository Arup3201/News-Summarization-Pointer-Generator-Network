Facebook pioneer Sean Parker is spending a staggering $9million to turn his wedding into a real-life Game of Thrones, it was claimed today.

The 34-year-old billionaire has reportedly hired a landscaping company to build fake ruins, waterfalls, bridges and a gated cottage in the surrounding woods at Ventana Inn in Big Sur, California.

Parker is marrying Alexandra Lenas, his girlfriend with whom he has a two-month-old daughter.

Brace yourselves: One observer said the wedding could turn into a 'Game of Thrones' fantasy re-enactment

Guests, who will each be wearing their
 own specially designed costumes, will enter through a $600,000 gate, 
dance on a $350,000 floor and walk past more than $1million worth of 
plants and flowers, according to TMZ.com.

The site also claims Parker has hired the costume designer from The Lord Of The Rings to make dreadlocks for those attending.

It claims the grand total comes to $8.6million and says the entire backdrop will be thrown away afterwards.

Last month, the New York Post reported that the save-the-date cards for the June 1 wedding look like wizard scrolls.

A source told the paper: 'There is a chance the wedding could end up looking like an episode of "Game of Thrones."'

Game of Thrones is a popular Medieval fantasy TV show on HBO that features knights and dragons and sorcery.

Parker
 is worth an estimated $2billion after becoming the founder of Napster 
and other tech start-ups and working with Facebook creator Mark 
Zuckerberg during the early days of the social network.

He was portrayed in the 2008 movie 'The Social Network' by Justin Timberlake, though he has taken issue with how his character was portrayed.

Parker proposed to Lenas, a singer-songwriter, in February after she gave birth to the couple's daughter, Winter Victoria Parker.

The fantasy wedding won't be the first time the the couple has played dress-up together.

They have been pictured during previous Halloween parties dressed as Justin Timberlake and Brittney Spears and as a gruesome duo from the Alfred Hitchcock film 'The Birds.'
