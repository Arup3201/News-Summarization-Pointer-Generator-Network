Janice Dickinson has described in graphic detail how Bill Cosby allegedly drugged then raped her in a Lake Tahoe hotel room more than 30 years ago.

The former supermodel, 59, broke down in tears in a live television interview accusing Cosby of using the offer of career advancement to lure her to a hotel room where he drugged her and raped her while she was unconscious.

Dickinson, speaking on CNN on Monday night, said she recalled waking up in extreme pain with Cosby's semen staining her clothes, after which she fled.

She said she had not suspected Cosby, whom she now considers a 'monster', of any ill intent because he was married.

Dickinson, who first claimed last month that Cosby had raped her, said that she was given wine and pills before blacking out at a meeting to which she had been lured with the promise of a part on the Cosby show.

According to Dickinson, Cosby tempted her with red wine despite knowing she had just left rehab for alcoholism. 

'I was alone with him', she said. 'I had menstrual cramp - he said "I have something for that" and he gave me a pill.'

'When I started to black out I had a Polaroid camera on me - I took several photographs. I just remember having him on me in my room the next morning.

'I remember waking up and that he - there was a lot of pain downstairs. There was semen all over me and my pajama bottoms were off. I just packed up and I got the hell out of there.

'I remember being extremely angry that I had been violated - I remember feeling disgusted at him, but I was disgusted at myself.

'I should have reported it to the Nevada police. I had crystal clear memory of this entire incident, of this rape.'

She later returned to the incident, detailing aspects of the night she says she remembers. She said: 'He was wearing a bathrobe and a gold watch... and I remember the feeling in my vagina and my anus... I've not been the same since.'

When confronted with Cosby's refusal, and lawyer allegations that her claims are made up, Dickinson angrily stood by her account.

She said: 'I am Janice Dickinson and I am the world's first supermodel and this happened in 1982.'

When her interviewer read a statement from Cosby characterizing the allegations against him as 'innuendo', she then accused him directly.

Dickinson said: 'Screw you, Bill. You know damn well he's not going to take any responsibility.

'Innuendo? I say you raped me Bill Cosby, you raped me in 1982 in Lake Tahoe.'

She also spoke at length about her reasons for trusting Cosby in the first place. She said: 'I do remember I was young i was innocent and I was very excited to get a call that I was going to be offered this job on the Cosby show and I trusted him. He was a married man.'

'[I trusted him] because of his demeanor and the promise of a career. I had a successful career and wanted to take it to the next level.'

When Dickinson told her story for the first time, it was met with a direct rebuttal from Cosby's legal camp, who called the account 'a fabricated lie'.

The statement, published by Variety magazine, said: 'Janice Dickinson’s story accusing Bill Cosby of rape is a lie.

'There is a glaring contradiction between what she is claiming now for the first time and what she wrote in her own book and what she told the media back in 2002.'

'...The only story she gave 12 years ago to the media and in her autobiography was that she refused to sleep with Mr. Cosby and he blew her off.

'Documentary proof and Ms. Dickinson’s own words show that her new story about something she now claims happened back in 1982 is a fabricated lie.'

Dickinson is just one of the women who has come out in recent weeks to accuse the comedian of drugging and raping her. He has denied the allegations. 

In 2006, one woman, Andrea Constand, claimed Cosby had drugged and assaulted her in his Philadelphia mansion in 2004. Her lawyers gathered 13 other alleged victims who were prepared to testify against the comic, but the civil case was settled, meaning that they did not have to speak. 

 

An earlier version of this article suggested that Stu Gardner offered Janice Dickinson red wine before she was allegedly assaulted by Bill Cosby. We are happy to make clear that Mr Gardner did not tempt Ms Dickinson  or offer her red wine.
