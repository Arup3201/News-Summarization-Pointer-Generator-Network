Prince Charles once expressed concern at his son's motorbike obsession.

But it seems the Duke of Cambridge does not share the same fatherly worries.

During a visit to the Midlands, Prince William spent a day trying out state-of-the-art power cruisers UK's flagship motorcycle show - and beamed as organisers presented him with a mini version for Prince George.

Ecstatic: The Duke of Cambridge delightedly climbed astride a Ducati Diavel at the UK's flagship bike event

Like father, like son: William clutched the bespoke balance bike presented to him for Prince George

In the afternoon, he completed his boyish day out with a football match - watching his side Aston Villa play Sunderland at home in a goalless draw.

Starting the day with the bike show, Prince William was in his element.

Along with his brother Prince Harry, the Duke has been a keen biker from a young age and currently owns a 1199cc Ducati.

In 2008 the heirs to the throne took part in an arduous motorcycle rally across Africa to raise money for a variety of charities including Sentebale, which was jointly founded by Prince Harry.

Today he astonished thousands of bike 
fans by making an appearance at Motorcycle Live in Birmingham's National
 Exhibition Centre.

Indulging his love of motorbikes, 
Prince William showed no sign of hesitation when someone from the crowd shouted for him to climb astride a cutting-edge Ducati Diavel.

Interested: The prince wanted to know everything about the new model. He currently owns a 1199cc Ducati

Fun: He was happy to sit for pictures as hundreds of fans excitedly stared at the unexpected visitor in Birmingham

With a laugh, William replied: 'Alright then, if I have to,' before jumping aboard.

Flanked by crowds, he walked through the arena talking to engineers and organisers at the Norton, Metisse, Triumph, CCM, Ducati, and Yamaha stands about the bikes.

One eight-year-old girl went over to the young royal to speak to him about the show.

Passing it on: Prince William was animated as he asked organisers about the balance bike made for his son

Present: Prince Charles once worried about William's bike obsession. It seems the duke doesn't feel so scared

Fit for a prince: The one-of-a-kind toy motorcycle has little personalised touches all over it for George

Specially-made: The mini bike was decorated with a coat of arms on the side and a 'G' topped with a crown

Royal rider: It seems the royals have embraced biking once and for all as little George is welcomed into the clan

Detail: The air socket stopper has been fashioned into a miniature crown for the third in line to the throne

Hat tip: And with a nod to mum and dad, organisers painted 'W' for William and 'C' for Catherine on the back

Bronte Williams, from North Devon, who was visiting the exhibition with her family, said: 'He was very nice and chatty.

'He asked me what I enjoyed and I told him the off-road show.'

Just before leaving, the Duke was presented with a balance bike for his son, Prince George.

He then headed to Villa Park with George's godfather William van Cutsem to support Aston Villa in their clash against Sunderland.

The Duke of Cambridge is a long-time Villa supporter and was in a box to watch his side take on the bottom-of-the-table Black Cats.

In the box: Later, he went to Villa Park with William van Cutsem for Aston Villa's clash with Sunderland

Support: Clad in an AVFC scarf, the duke roared on the Villains during a match that was 0-0 at half time

Close: Aston Villa may be nine spots ahead of Sunderland in the table but they are having no luck today

Fan: He has always maintained that young George will be a Villa fan like him, his friends and his brother

Roared: Sat behind other fans, he and his friends screamed and shouted in support of the Villains throughout

But it was a stagnant game that ended 0-0.

The heir to the throne helped organise
 the first competitive game at Buckingham Palace earlier this year 
between two of England's oldest amateur clubs, Civil Service FC and 
Polytechnic FC, as part of the FA's anniversary celebrations.

Prince William is not the first member of the Royal Family to support the Villains, and he will not be the last.

The proud father said last month that his baby son George will be a devoted Aston Villa fan like him.

It had the royal crest emblazoned on it, a 'G' with a crown above it and the Motorcycle Live logo.

He also watched riders taking part in the Yamaha off-road experience, a short off-road course inside the NEC.

Motorcycle Live, at the NEC from November 23 to December 1, is the Motorcycle Industry Association's flagship event.

Spectating: The prince walked around the arena speaking to representatives from companies like Yamaha

Shows: During his talks with engineers, he watched off-road shows demonstrated by professionals

The association has looked after the interests of the motorcycle industry in the UK for over 100 years.

Its members manufacture and import motorbikes and supply associated goods and services in the UK.

The association says its objective is to promote, protect and expand the motorcycle industry for the benefit of its members.
