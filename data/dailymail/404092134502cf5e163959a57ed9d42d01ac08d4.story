A Florida couple were allegedly caught having sex in a parked truck in clear view of children at playground in Florida.

The couple was reported in a phone call to the Greenacres Police Department around 5pm that day, according to the Sun-Sentinel.

Multiple children were reportedly less than 200 feet away while the duo engaged in intercourse.

Couple: Shane Johnson, left, and Danielle Stager, right, were allegedly having sex in a parked truck on Friday - with children at a playground able to see what was going on 

Citing the arrest report, the Sun-Sentinel said a police officer discovered 26-year-old Danielle Stager and 38-year-old Shane Johnson as they had sex in a parked truck.

Per the newspaper, Stager allegedly told Johnson 'Shane, we are going to jail' after she noticed the officer's presence.

Police told WPTV that Stager and Johnson were 180 feet away from a daycare group. Children could clearly see the couple, authorities told the television station. 

The Sun-Sentinel reported that four children  told cops the couple had been beside a tree and had their pants lowered.

The newspaper reported that though the pair were outside near the tree when they began, they could still be seen after relocating.

Stager and Johnson are facing lewd or lascivious behavior charges and were released from jail over the weekend, according to the Sun-Sentinel.
