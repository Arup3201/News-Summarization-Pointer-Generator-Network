She's juggling a hectic presenting schedule with the demands of a new baby but that hasn't prevented Fearne Cotton from finding the time to pose in her new collection for Very.

The collection references all of winter's key trends, including shaggy faux fur and lace, albeit with a rock chick twist.

Highlights include a vibrant red lace skater dress, a wearable Breton-striped T-shirt and a glamorous tweed coat with a faux fur shawl collar.

'Each season I try and adapt what I’m 
doing design wise, from my influence, inspirations and the way I think 
about the collection,' says Fearne.

'I want to keep it moving each time
 and get braver with what I’m designing.'

The new range, which is Fearne's 11th to date, goes on sale today with prices for pieces in the range starting at £29.

Fearne, who has been designing collections for Very since 2009, is famous for her rock n' roll look and has shown no sign of toning it down since becoming mother to Rex, seven months.

And it seems her look appeals to more than just would-be rock chicks, with her biannual collection for Very ranking among the most popular offered by the e-tailer.

'Fearne is a great style icon for women,' says Julie Donnelly, head of womenswear buying at Very.co.uk.

'Her relaxed and fun attitude to style encourages our customers to try new things and to be confident in their own style decisions.'
