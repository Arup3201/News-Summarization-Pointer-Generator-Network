In the first flush of love, it's perfectly natural to try to spend as much time as you can with that special person.

But an American couple took that to the extreme and decided to test the strength of their feelings for each other by spending 48 hours handcuffed together.

Mark Malkoff and his wife Christine, from New York, undertook the patience-stretching ordeal to see just how solid their marriage is.

The ties that bind: Mark Malkoff and his wife Christine spent 48 hours shackled together with handcuffs

Is this a good idea? The couple webchat to a relationship advisor about their strange challenge

Mr Malkoff, a comedian, writer, and filmmaker who formerly worked for Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, and Christine soon learned that even simple tasks like doing the dishes, going for a meal and food shopping suddenly become a test of flexibility and team work when you are shackled together.

Even sleeping is incredibly uncomfortable as every shuffle wakes the other person up. And then there's the delicate issue of going to the toilet.

Mr Malkoff said: ' Some people feel like they're handcuffed to their spouse. I'm literally going to be handcuffed to mine. We're going to see more of each other than we ever have before.'

'That's not a good thing,' Christine, evidently an understanding woman, deadpans.

At the start of the two days of enforced intimacy, the couple spoke to relationship expert Andrea Syrtash. When asked if it's a good idea, she said: 'Actually, I advise couples to take time apart.'

'Yeah, we can't really do that, can we?' Malkoff responds, perhaps unnecessarily.

A day after trailing behind his wife as she vacuums, looking glum, struggling to get through doors and numerous other trials, Malkoff began to regret making the rash decision.

He said: 'I actually regret this.'

Free at last! The Malkoffs are unshackled after their two day ordeal

The couple were surprisingly good-humoured throughout the 48 hours

But the pair made it through with their marriage intact - and immediately went out to spend some much-needed time apart.

This isn't the first time Malkoff has engaged in bizaare behaviour. He gained worldwide media attention when he made a video detailing his attempt to visit all 171 Starbucks franchises in Manhattan in a single day.

He made headlines in January 2008 when he moved into an IKEA store in Paramus, New Jersey, for a week as his apartment was fumigated and in June 2009, he lived on a jet for 30 days in order to conquer his fear of flying.

In 2009 he drove around the country seeing how many U.S. mayors he could get to present him their key to the city, managing an impressive 95.
