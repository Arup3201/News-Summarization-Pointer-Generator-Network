Willian watched on as Brazil won their World Cup opener against Croatia on Thursday, before the Chelsea midfielder was put through his paces with his fellow fringe players the day after.

Willian and Ramires, who got on as a second-half substitute, were among those set about doing added exercises on the sand at the squad's Granja Comary training complex.

But they will hope their extra efforts in training will improve their chances of getting time on the grass.

Brazil's next game comes against Mexico on Tuesday, as the tournament favourites prepare to move forward in their bid to add a sixth star to their chest.

Their 3-1 win over Croatia came courtesy of a Neymar double and a 91st-minute curler from Chelsea midfielder Oscar, who became the first Premier League goalscorer of the tournament.

His team-mates, Willian and Ramires, will hope to have an impact of their own.
