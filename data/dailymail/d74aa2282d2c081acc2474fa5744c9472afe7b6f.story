There may never be a British Edward Snowden because GCHQ treats contractors 'as if they are people', the outgoing head of the government's listening post has said. 

In his first ever print interview today, Sir Iain Lobban revealed he feared Mr Snowden could have been a Brit when his leaks were first reported - before discovering he was American.

But he insisted a key fact was that Mr Snowden was an unattached contractor with high-level access but little loyalty to the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). 

Unlikely: Outgoing GCHQ chief Sir Iain Lobban, pictured before a parliamentary committee last year, said a British Edward Snowden was unlikely because the spy agency treats contractors 'as if they are people'

Security experts in Britain, on the other hand, were likely to be more loyal because they were more firmly embedded with the government.

The 54-year-old was forced to defend his organisation to MPs in an unprecedented public hearing after the U.S. whistleblower revealed it was gathering millions of pieces of data on British citizens.

Almost a year later, he has given an interview just days from stepping down as the head of the spy agency.

He told Charles Moore, a former editor of the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph: 'When I heard the news... I lay awake saying to myself: "I hope this isn't a Brit".'

But, he insisted, GCHQ 'treats our contractors as if they are people. We wouldn't body-shop them' - so they are unlikely to betray their employers in the same way.

Based in a doughnut-shaped building with more than 5,000 employees in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters) was formed in 1919 and employed Enigma code-breaker Alan Turing in the Second World War.

The rise of digital communications has pushed it to the forefront of British spying - as well as the headlines which surrounded the Snowden affair.

The 31-year-old leaker, who is sheltering in Russia, claimed GCHQ was monitoring up to 600 million communications a day by 'tapping' fibre-optic cables which carried data into Britain.

Despite believing there are few employees who think like Mr Snowden, Sir Iain told Mr Moore the leaks had 'made my job a thousand times more difficult'.

Another staff member in the Cheltenham headquarters said jobs which once took two weeks now take six because of the leaks.

Whitehall chiefs revealed Sir Iain would be leaving his role just two months after he was forced to defend his organisation before the government's Intelligence and Security Committee.

In an unprecedented 90-minute hearing alongside the heads of MI5 and MI6 last November, he claimed terrorists were already changing their tactics because of Mr Snowden's revelations.

He added: 'We don't want to delve into innocent e-mails and phonecalls. I don't employ the type of people who would do.

'If you think of the internet as an enormous hay field, what we are trying to do is to collect hay from those parts of the field that we can get access to.

'When we gather that haystack, and remember it is not a haystack from the whole field, it is a haystack from a tiny proportion of that field, we are very, very well aware that within that haystack there is going to be plenty of hay which is innocent communications from innocent people.

'The cumulative effect of the media coverage, the global media coverage, will make the job that we have far, far harder for years to come.'

Despite Sir Iain being just 53 when his departure was revealed, the government insisted it was not linked to the Snowden row and had been long in the planning.

The NSA whistleblower defended his decision to leak thousands of documents in an appearance in April before Europe's largest human rights watchdog.

He told the Council of Europe, a human rights group with 47 member states: 'My motivation is to improve government, not to bring it down.'

Despite the changes which had been made because of his revelations, he added: 'I remain in a position of significant legal jeopardy'.
