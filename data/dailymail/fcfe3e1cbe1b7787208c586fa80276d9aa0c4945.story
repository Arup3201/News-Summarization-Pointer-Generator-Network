A waste management boss and car enthusiast has created the world's fastest skip - capable of reaching speeds of more than 155mph.

James Norvill spent six weeks building his unusual vehicle, attaching an eight yard builders' skip to the base of a Subaru Impreza WRX Type R car at a cost of £15,000.

The motor, dubbed the skipcar, is officially been named the world's fastest waste disposal unit after it clocked 93mph on a 400 metre drag racing circuit - thanks to its 2000CC 300BHP engine.

'The skipcar turns heads wherever we go,' said 32-year-old Mr Norvill, the CEO of waste management company GD Environmental Services.

'People love to see it drive past them and I'm always getting honked at when I overtake other cars.'

Despite weighing in at a hefty 1.1 tonnes, the vehicle can reach 60mph in just 5.3 seconds thanks to its base made out of the Impreza.

Not content with driving around his home town of Newport, south Wales, Mr Norvill took the skipcar to the famous drag racing track Santa Pod Raceway in Bedfordshire where he broke the land speed record for a waste disposal unit.

'I took it down and they had sold out 15,000 tickets to watch us break the record - it was a massive rush,' he said.

The vehicle has gained a cult following, even appearing at the open of the Six Nations in France in 2008, but like many of the best ideas, Mr Norvill admits his car was dreamed up over a few pints in his local pub.

After coming up with the scheme as a charity fundraiser, Mr Norvill bought an old car to attach his skip to

'In Newport we used to push people round in a trolley to raise money for charity,' he said.

'We got to thinking that we could put wheels on a skip and push that round the town for the same ends.

'After a few more pints it all spiralled out of control and the following week I was buying a battered old Subaru to attach the skip to.'
