It may no longer work at a store, but Kurt Cobain's credit card will soon be worth a lot more. 

Bids on the deceased Nirvana front man's  Seafirst Bank Visa have already reached $16,600, and the auction still has four days left.

The gold card has Cobain's signature scribbled on the back in blue ballpoint pen, with what appears to be a phone number written next to it.

Kurt Cobain's Visa credit card, which contains the Nirvana front man's signature and a phone number scribbled on the back, is up for auction. The highest bid is already at $16,600 

Cobain's card is currently the highest selling item in online marketplace Paddle8's 'Legendary: Memorabilia From Rock Gods and Pop Stars auction' 

It is accompanied with a 'Kings of Clubs Slot Club' credit card holder from the Riverside Resort Hotel and Casino in Nevada. 

Seattle's Seafirst Bank became incorporated into Bank of America in 2000 and no longer exists.  

Cobain's card is being sold on the online marketplace Paddle8 as part of it's 'Legendary: Memorabilia From Rock Gods and Pop Stars' auction series.

Paddle8 initially valued the Visa's worth at $7,000 to $9,000. 

The small square of plastic is currently the highest-selling item in the collection.

The only item that even comes close is Frank Sinatra's 1944 driver's license, with the highest bid currently at $7,000.

Other items on sale include a signed check from Jim Morrison and a handwritten set-list by U2. 

Eighteen people have bid on the credit card so far, which had a February 1995 expiration date.

Cobain committed suicide on April 5, 1994. He was 27. 

The auction comes on the heels of what would have been Cobain's 48th birthday on February 20. 

A much-anticipated documentary about the grunge legend, Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck, will premiere in May. It is being executive produced by Cobain's daughter, Frances Bean.
