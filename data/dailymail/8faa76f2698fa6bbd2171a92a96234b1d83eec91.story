When Nicaraguan police saw a man acting suspiciously, they detained and searched him finding what appeared to be bags of compressed marijuana.

However, when they took him to the station in Matagalpa, a city 80 miles north of the capital, to be booked for possession they discovered that what they thought was a drug was, in fact, horse manure.

‘Supposedly that stuff was marijuana, but it’s not marijuana,’ the unidentified dope told television station TN8. ‘It seems it is horses***. Some maje on the street robbed my money.’

The big dope: This unidentified Nicaraguan was hoping to get high from his purchase of marijuana but ended up feeling down in the dumps

Getting to the bottom: It was only when police analysed this, they discovered that it was not marijuana but compressed horse droppings

Long arm of the law: The identified man is taken into custody after being seen acting suspiciously

The suspect was in the possession of several plastic bags of what appeared to be compressed marijuana

The man revealed that he bought the ‘drug’ because he was offered a great price and only discovered his error when he went to sample his wares.

‘I’m not a dealer, I work on a coffee farm,’ the man said although he admitted that he was regular user. ‘I feel robbed. I was going to smoke a joint and get half-crazy on the bus, but instead what I got was a big horse t***.’

Police scientists analyse the 'drugs' confiscated from the would-be dopehead and discover that they are, in fact, from the back end of a horse

He nose y'know: A policeman has the unfortunate task of sniffing the haul not knowing that his nose is in a bag of horse manure

The man admitted that he was regular user. 'I feel robbed. I was going to smoke a joint and get half-crazy on the bus, but instead what I got was a big horse t***.'

The Nicaraguan bought these baggies assuming that it was marijuana only to find out they were horse droppings
