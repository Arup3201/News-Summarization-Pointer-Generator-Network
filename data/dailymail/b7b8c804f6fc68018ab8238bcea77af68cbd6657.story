Liverpool star Raheem Sterling is continuing to soak up the rays in Jamaica before he has to step up preparations for next season's Premier League campaign.

The 19-year-old, who was born in Jamaica, revealed on his official Instagram account that he was in the popular tourist destination of Ocho Rios.

Sterling decided to jet off after he returned from Brazil following England's early group stage exit at the World Cup.

Valuable experience: Sterling learned a lot from his time at the World Cup

The winger is set to join back up with the rest of Liverpool's squad later this month in order to start preparations for his side's first game of the season against Southampton on August 16.

Sterling believes playing in the World Cup will have a positive impact on the rest of his career - despite the Three Lions' premature elimination.

'For any young person to be involved in such a big tournament is obviously a great experience and it was no different for myself,' Sterling told LoopJamaica.com.

'It was a good feeling to get out there on the pitch and show the world what I could do really.

'Obviously on a team performance [level], we are disappointed with how the tournament went. We would have liked to be in the tournament up until now and all the way to the final, but that was not the case.

'It was a learning curve for me - an experience I am willing to learn from. Hopefully we build from this World Cup experience and go even further in the next four years.'

The former Queens Park Rangers starlet is also hoping Liverpool can improve on last season's highly impressive campaign - where they finished second to Manchester City.

'Last season we did really well as a team. This season we will just go in the same as we did last year and take it step by step, week in week out,' added Sterling.

'Hopefully we can do well as a team and a collective. We will be going out there on a positive note and hopefully we can do what we know we can do.'
