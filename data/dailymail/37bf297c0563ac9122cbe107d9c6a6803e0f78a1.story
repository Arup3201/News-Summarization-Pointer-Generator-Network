All eyes were fixed on the Amal Alamuddin as she wed the world's most eligible bachelor but the 36-year-old lawyer seemed unfazed as she walked the streets of Venice in a series of elegant, floating gowns.

While her wedding dress is shrouded in secrecy, there is no doubting her style credentials shone over the course of the weekend's celebrations.

Making her first post-nuptial appearance on Sunday  the British-Lebanese lawyer stepped out in a lace long-sleeved Giambattista Valli dress dotted with bright flowers.

Amal's dress featured purple and red floral embellishments and a drop hem, which showed off her perfect pins while George looked dapper in an Armani suit.

The white lace kept to a strong bridal theme and the drop hem is clearly a style Amal favours, having worn a similar waterfall gown for their pre-wedding dinner, in Venice on Friday night.

The Resort 2011 red printed Alexander McQueen dress had been slightly altered to her preferences and again showcased her super svelte legs with an asymmetric hemline for the meal at the exclusive five-star Belmond Cipriani Hotel on the nearby island of Giudecci.

The flowing  frock was dominated by black oozing into a scarlet shade and Amal wore matching lipstick with her hair perfectly coiffed into a voluminous side parting.

She further glammed up the vivacious frock with a pair of drop diamond earrings, looking every inch the princess George is making her feel.

Wearing a wide smile on her face, the 36-year-old looked happy as she left the hotel with her suited and booted husband-to-be George.

The beautiful, striped midi dress by Dolce & Gabbana has now sold out

With George looking slightly more casual without a tie the couple sped through Venice on taxi boats en route to their nuptials

Earlier in the weekend Amal channelled vintage Hollywood glamour in a retro monochrome dress with dainty black heels and a co-ordinating hat box as they when they sped through Venice on Friday on taxi boats to their future wedding location. 

Unfortunately the beautiful, striped midi dress by Dolce & Gabbana has now sold out but that doesn't mean stripes aren't worth investing in.

On Wednesday UsWeekly reported 36-year-old lawyer Amal Alamuddin would wed the 53-year-old actor in a gown by designer Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen.

Amal has also been seen at the headquarters of Alexander McQueen, the fashion label that created Kate Middleton's wedding dress in 2011.  

Her wedding dress has been shrouded in secrecy as it's believed US Vogue has secured the rights to the wedding pictures and the couple will be donating the fee they receive to a charity of their choice.

The pair reportedly banned guests from bringing mobile phones in a bid to prevent unauthorised pictures being leaked from the event.
