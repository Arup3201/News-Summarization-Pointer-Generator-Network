Sweeping rain could turn into ice overnight with widespread frost expected for much of the country as temperatures drop to freezing.

Forecasters are predicting an icy weather front drifting in from the Atlantic, which could see treacherous conditions during the night, especially across southern and western areas.

The Met Office is also expecting some freezing fog patches during the latter part of tonight - predominantly across southern parts of England and Wales.

It comes as most of the country woke up to a wet start this morning, as snow fell on the top of the highest peaks - including the Scottish Highlands and the Brecon Beacons and Snowdonia regions of Wales.

John Lee, a forecaster for MeteoGroup said: 'For England and Wales it should clear and get colder tonight, with a risk of ice pretty much anywhere and freezing fog patches.'

Met Office forecaster, Helen Roberts, said: 'The sleet across parts of England and Wales should be almost cleared away within the next couple of hours and it should be dry just about everywhere across the UK.

'There will be some wintry showers in the far north but it will be a predominantly clear and dry night. But there will be some widespread frost away from the southern counties and thickening cloud in the far south west.

'Freezing fog patches will be around in the latter part of tonight and will be fairly patchy, but we're most likely to see it in southern parts.'

She added: 'Tomorrow will start off cold and frosty and the cloud in the far south west from the previous night will begin to spread northwards - reaching South Wales by mid morning and northern England by the afternoon. 

'It will still be relatively cold tomorrow, particularly where fog is slow to clear, but it will be largely dry.'

She said that Sunday night will be slightly warmer than tonight with much more cloud around.
