AC Milan have accused Juventus of doctoring television graphics to convince viewers that Carlos Tevez was onside for his controversial goal on Saturday night.

League leaders Juventus beat rivals AC Milan 3-1 in Turin, but there was considerable angst among Milan fans, who believed that Tevez was offside for the opening goal of the game.

Milan tweeted a photograph, supposedly taken from Juventus TV's analysis of the incident. The picture appears to show a clearly manipulated line, to prove that Tevez was onside when he was, in fact, not.

In a statement to Corriere della Serra, Milan's general manager Adriano Galliani took things a step further by saying:

'The production of the television images for Juve home games is controlled by the club itself. They purposely don’t show the replay of the opening goal. 

'I’m going to kick up a storm at the next Lega [Serie A] assembly to ensure the Lega can produce all of the games without conceding the option to just one club to control their own images.

'I am against the fact that they just end up showing what they want.'

Backing up their general manager's claims, the official AC Milan website also posted a short statement, which read:

'Arrogance is a Juventus trait and something they cannot escape from. 

'It would be superfluous to respond to anyone like this. It is a good thing, however, that even they agree to open up the discussion and debate over the production of TV graphics which emerged following the episode during Juventus-Milan last night.'
