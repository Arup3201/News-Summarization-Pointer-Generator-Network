The following poster was created by Club Dakota in Ringwood, Victoria 

A Melbourne nightclub that used an image of a woman with her mouth duct taped shut has been accused of promoting their club through violent images.

The poster was created by Dakota Nightclub in Ringwood and used to advertise a local party scheduled for October 4.

It featured a young woman grimacing with her hands over her face, and her eyes closed while duct tape covered her mouth. 

The image was removed from the club's Facebook page on Tuesday night. 

Kristine Olaris, the chief executive at women's agency Women's Health East, opposed the implications behind the poster, describing the woman as appearing 'gagged'. 

MS Olaris told the Herald Sun that the poster had 'strong overtones of violence'.

'The woman in the advertisement looks distressed and is clearly silenced through being gagged,' she said.

The image was removed from the club's Facebook page on Tuesday night after receiving criticism  

'It is time that everyone in our community, including these types of venues, treat women with equality and ­respect.'

Jerril Rechter, the CEO of VicHealth, also said she believes that the photograph is 'inappropriate' due to the violent culture that it promotes.

Daily Mail Australia has approached Club Dakota for comment.
