Apple has made a U-turn in its app review strategy after reversing an earlier decision to ban MassRoots.

The social app allows its members to speak with other cannabis users and discover new marijuana strains and trends.

It was removed from the App Store late last year because Apple said it promotes illegal substances online.

Apple has made a U-turn in its app strategy after reversing an earlier decision to ban MassRoots. The social app allows its members to speak with other cannabis users and discover new marijuana strains and trends

According to App Store guideline 2.18: ‘Apps that encourage excessive consumption of alcohol or illegal substances, or encourage minors to consume alcohol or smoke cigarettes, will be rejected.’

MassRoots has now announced that Apple has agreed to allow the app back in the store just three months after the ban was enforced.

However, the app is now restricted to users located in one of the 23 states where medical or recreational marijuana is legal. 

To enforce this, Apple phones will conduct an automatic geo-location before allowing users to down the app. 

MassRoots recently announced that Apple has agreed to allow the app back in the store just three months after the ban was enforced. The group had campaigned to get the app reinstated 

The company added in a blog post that it intends to implement more checks to ensure it complies with the rule.‘We do not take this task lightly,’ it wrote.  ‘Over the coming weeks, we will be implementing new features to strengthen our compliance even beyond what is currently required’

MacRumors noted that it was possible to get around the geo-restrictions by signing up for a MassRoots account through the website before logging into the app.

But MassRoots founder Isaac Dietrich said the Colorado-based private site was working to close the loophole.

The company added in a blog post that it intends to implement more checks to ensure it complies with the rule.

‘We do not take this task lightly,’ it wrote. ‘Over the coming weeks, we will be implementing new features to strengthen our compliance even beyond what is currently required.’

MassRoots is available on the App Store for free, and has been updated to version 3.0.

The states in which marijuana is legal in some form include Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington. 

Tweets often reveal growing trends among young people - and now scientists have revealed cannabis has become a popular topic.

During a single month, researchers identified more than seven million tweets referring to marijuana, with 'pro-pot' messages outnumbering those opposed to the drug by 15 to one.

Most of those sending and receiving 'pot tweets' were under the age of 25, and many in their teens, said the team.

US psychiatrist and lead author Dr Patricia Cavazos-Rehg, from the Washington University Institute for Public Health, said: 'It's a concern because frequent marijuana use can affect brain structures and interfere with cognitive function, emotional development and academic performance.

'The younger people are when they begin using marijuana, the more likely they are to become dependent.

'A lot of young people will phase out of marijuana use as they get older, but unfortunately, we're not good at predicting who those individuals are.'

The findings, reported in the Journal of Adolescent Health, follow a computer search of tweets conducted between February 5 and March five last year.
