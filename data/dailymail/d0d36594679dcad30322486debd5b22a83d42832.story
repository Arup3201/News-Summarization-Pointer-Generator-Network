Charles Ross was arrested after deputies received complaints about him giving wedgies to unsuspecting people at a Florida movie theater

A Florida prankster who enjoys ‘harassing’ people in public and posting the results on YouTube, is facing battery charges and even possibly prison time after one of his latest victims didn’t find his behavior very funny.

Charles Ross, 18, of Bradenton, Fla., was arrested on a misdemeanor charge on Sunday after deputies received complaints about him giving wedgies to unsuspecting people at a movie theater.

According to a police report, Ross harassed customers by grabbing them ‘by the back of [their] pants and pulled them up hard.’

After administering the wedgie, Ross would then ask his victim if they wanted to hit him, police said.

Ross had a number of victims come 
forward to police. Although most were too embarrassed to pursue charges, one 
filled out an affidavit.

‘It is a battery,’ Dave Bristow from 
the Manatee County Sheriff’s Office told ABCNews.com. ‘He did unlawfully
 touch someone, so technically it’s a battery.’

On his YouTube channel RossCreations, Ross has uploaded 60 videos of himself performing pranks, including unplanned ‘trust falls’ with unsuspecting strangers, kissing strangers, and performing handstands over beach-goers. It has attracted more than 57,500 subscribers and nearly five million views.

Ross hasn’t yet been able to upload his latest video as the camera was seized by police as evidence.

‘We have video of this, so it’s just whether or not the state wants to pursue it,’ Bristow said.

Ross has posted a $750 bond and will appear before a judge within a month for the crime, which carries possible jail time.

An unrepentant Ross told 10News Tampa Bay that he does not disagree with the charge or arrest.

‘I'm sorry that someone got offended. It's supposed to be a joke. Some people find humor and laugh at it... others can't,’ he said.

This is his second prank-related arrest in three months, after he was charged with disorderly conduct in November. A Sarasota Sheriff's deputy says he was sitting on a picnic table when Ross jumped on top of it and over the deputy's head, putting him in harm's way.

Despite his latest arrest, Ross says he will keep making his prankster videos, although he plans to focus more on ones where he is the butt of the joke.
