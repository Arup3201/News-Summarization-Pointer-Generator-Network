Unsuspecting drivers in Lowell, Michigan, got a holiday surprise to remember recently when a police man gave them Christmas gifts instead of traffic tickets.

Officer Scot VanSolkema was tasked with being the local force’s very own Father Christmas.

He pulled drivers over for minor issues - which wouldn't normally warrant police attention – including traveling five miles or less above the limit, or snow partially covering their license plate during a week of heavy snowfall.

While talking to the drivers, VanSolkema quizzed them about what they want for Christmas and what their children are asking from Santa Claus.

Wearing a GoPro camera and a hidden mic, Officer VanSolkema was able to radio a team of people at a local store who then rushed to get the gifts and quickly delivered them to wherever he was located.

Officer VanSolkema then gave the presents - including expensive items including an Xbox and a flat-screen TV – to the disbelieving drivers most of whom were left overjoyed by the acts of generosity.

After one mom receives a gift for her little boy she told the officer, ‘This just turned my bad day into a good one.’

One lucky driver got an Xbox console for his children and was delighted because he had just told the officer that he wasn't going to be able to afford it

The footage was filmed over November 19 and 20 and the task of getting motorists to open up about specific gifts and then get them wait around for those gifts to be delivered was a challenge, said VanSolkema.

'The next time a police officer asks you some odd question, maybe you should answer it,' he told TODAY, 'because you never know what can happen.' 

VanSolkema gave out about 30 gifts totaling between $7,000 and $10,000. 

The heart-warming idea was a collaboration between the local police, videographer Rob Bliss and the UP TV network, who funded the gifts.

At a time when police nationwide have been in the news for negative reasons - especially following the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York - they hope the video will remind people about good police officers and their dedication.

'The majority of the time that we have contact with people, it’s either on a traffic stop or at one of the lowest points of their life,' said Det. Gordy Lauren. 

'It was a great opportunity for our officers to get out there and have a very, very positive encounter with them that these people will never forget, for the rest of their lives.'

The video was posted on Tuesday on YouTube and has already received more than 40,000 hits.

A message at the end of the video states, 'While we don’t encourage minor traffic violations, it’s important for police departments to take the time to show their citizens just how much they care.'
