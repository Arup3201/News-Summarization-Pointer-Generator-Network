Borussia Dortmund heaped the pressure on Hannover coach Tayfun Korkut with a 3-2 win at the Niedersachsenstadion which revives their own hopes of qualifying for Europe next season.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was on target twice for Jurgen Klopp's men, who were knocked out of the Champions League by Juventus on Wednesday.

Shinji Kagawa netted their other goal with Lars Stindl scoring twice for Hannover, who lost Leonardo Bittencourt to a 55th-minute red card.

Hannover coach Tayfun Korkut is under pressure following his side's third consecutive defeat 

Stuttgart came from behind to earn their first win of 2015, with Daniel Ginczek bagging a brace and Alexandru Maxim on target after Haris Seferovic gave Frankfurt the lead just after half-time.

The win still leaves Huub Stevens' men at the foot of the table, but now just two points now from safety.

Freiburg crept out of the drop zone with a 2-0 win over Augsburg, courtesy of strikes from Jonathan Schmid and Nils Petersen in the final 20 minutes.

Christian Streich's side clinched only their fifth win of the season, enough to take them above both Hamburg and Paderborn and out of the bottom three.

That was partly because Paderborn could only manage a goalless draw at home against Hoffenheim, while Matthias Lehmann's late penalty earned a 1-1 draw for Werder Bremen after Davie Selke had put Cologne in front.
