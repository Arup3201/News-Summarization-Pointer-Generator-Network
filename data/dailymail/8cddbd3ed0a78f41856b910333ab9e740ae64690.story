A plane carrying about 50 passengers was forced to make an emergency landing after a mid-air fuel leak was discovered less than halfway into its flight.

The pilot reported fuel leaking from the right wing while the American Eagle flight was en route to Milwaukee, Wisconsin from Dallas, Texas yesterday.

The two-hour flight was aborted and the aircraft landed safely in Springfield, Missouri.

As a precaution, firefighters and other emergency responders were waiting on the tarmac when the jet landed at Springfield-Branson National Airport, according to ABC News affiliate KSPR.

Passengers were on the ground for about an hour before they were put on a different plane to continue their journey to Milwaukee. 

American Eagle, owned by American Airlines, had another jet available at the airport because the carrier has a maintenance base in Springfield, KSPR reported.

Mechanics were brought in to examine and fix the plane that was forced to make the emergency landing.
