The majority of this weekend’s attentions are firmly placed on the two rivalry battles between Liverpool and Manchester United and Barcelona and Real Madrid.

The latter especially will be full of some of the greatest players in the world all trying to create something special to give their fans a reason to cheer.

But the likes of Lionel Messi and Cristiano will do well to match the finish of Hungarian second division footballer Birtalan Botond on Sunday.

The cross comes in from a fellow teammate during the Hungarian division two game at the weekend

The ball is slightly behind Birtalan Botond so he attempts an audacious scorpion kick from outside the box

Botond makes a perfect connection which leaves the opposition back-peddling into his own net

The goalkeeper can do nothing about the effort and is left crouched over the line in his own goal

Bostond is joined by his fellow teammates as he enjoys the celebrations for his wonder goal 

Botond, who plays for Bekescsaba, stunned fans when he scored a volleyed scorpion kick from outside the box against Gyirmot.

The stunning effort left the opposition goalkeeper back-peddling into his own net, but there was no way he was keeping it out.

It was a goal fit enough to win any game, but unfortunately it only secured Botond’s side a point.
