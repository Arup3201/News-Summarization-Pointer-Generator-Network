A blind pensioner who has raised thousands for national charity Guide Dogs for the Blind has been refused a replacement dog following her previous dog's retirement, and she says its because the charity say 'she walks too slowly'.

Shirley Waller, 80, from Market Deeping in Lincolnshire had her guide dog Alfie retired by the charity after it chewed and swallowed part of a wool glove and required surgery have it removed from its stomach.

The pensioner, who has lived with guide dogs for 25 years, now has to learn to use a white cane, and must be taken out for walks by a sighted volunteer.

Shirley now has to learn how to use a white cane after 25 years of using guide dogs to help her day-to-day life, following the confiscation of her guide dog Alfie (in picture left)

While Alfie was having surgery, Waller asked for a retired guide dog to keep her company, but the charity refused.

After this, she was told that not only will Alfie not be returned, but she will also not be provided another guide dog.

She said: 'They said they were taking Alfie away because I couldn't look after him.

'They said I couldn't have another dog because I walk too slowly.

'I can't get my head around it. I feel after 25 years of being able to go out and about, now I can't because I have had to revert back to a white cane.

'I am 80 and learning to use a white cane is not an easy task.

'My walking has suffered because I have not been able to get out and about. I'm stuck at home waiting for any kind of person to come and take me for a walk.'

Shirley and Alfie display Olympic pride in July 2012, when she was nominated to carry the Olympic torch through her town

Waller spent years raising money for Guide Dogs for the Blind, and in July 2012 was nominated to carry the Olympic torch through her home town.

Since losing her guide dog, she has been unable to do work for the charity, such as speaking at schools, because she doesn't have a guide dog to accompany her.

She said: 'I feel completely and utterly let down. I have worked for the charity in all weathers collecting, doing talks to raise awareness.

'I was so happy to do it because they had got me out of this dark world, but now they have pushed me back into it. I'm not the person I was.'

A spokesman for the charity said: 'We care very deeply about the health and well being of our guide dogs and, as Mrs Waller’s dog was experiencing health issues, we made the difficult decision to retire him early.

'We understand that losing her guide dog has been a very tough for Mrs Waller. Guide dogs are life-changing for their owners and so to be parted from one can be difficult.

'In circumstances such as these, we assess the our service user’s needs individually to see if there are other ways we can help them to get out and about on their own terms, and we’re now supporting Mrs Waller with long cane training and our My Guide sighted guiding service.

In happier days: Shirley Waller is devastated that her dog has been confiscated

'For someone to qualify with a guide dog we need to know that they would be getting out and about on a regular basis with their dog, have appropriate living conditions and would be able to care for their dog accordingly.'

'A guide dog has to act as a mobility aid to its owner and needs to have a sufficient work load.'

'Before anyone can be matched with a new guide dog, regardless of whether they have had one before or not, they need to be individually assessed.

For someone to qualify for a guide dog the charity needs to know that they would be getting out and about on a regular basis with their dog.

The are also in charge of making sure the dogs have appropriate living conditions and that the owners would be able to care for their dog accordingly.

Since the surgery, Alfie was left in poor health and requires constant attention and care.

Shirley Waller was born in Manchester where she worked as a nurse until she met her husband Albert.

The couple moved to Peterborough in 1977 and had seven children. 

They had planned to move to north Wales to retire, but Albert was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and Shirley lost her sight.

After the couple moved to Market Deeping in Lincolnshire, Albert passed away in 2001

Waller lost one of her sons in a helicopter crash in May 2007.

Jonathan Waller, 42, was flying back from the Chelsea v Liverpool Champions League match with millionaire Chelsea vice-President Phillip Carter, 44, teenage son Andrew and pilot Stephen Holdich, 49, when the helicopter crashed in thick fog near Carter's home in Cambridgeshire.
