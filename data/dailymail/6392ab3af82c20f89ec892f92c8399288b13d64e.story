A doctor who is running for a Republican Kansas senate seat has been exposed after he uploaded X-ray images of patients' fatal injuries to Facebook and made fun of them.

Dr. Milton Wolf, a radiologist and distant cousin of President Barack Obama who practices in Kansas City, told The Topeka Capital-Journal that he uploaded the photos for 'educational purposes.'

The paper maintains that the images were accompanied by Facebook comments made by Wolf and others making fun of dead or wounded patients.

Wolf has come under fire from members of the public, as well as from a spokesperson for political rival Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS).

Milton Wolf, seen here in an image from his Facebook page, allegedly uploaded grisly photos of patients' X-rays to Facebook and 'made fun' of them. He is currently running for US Senate in Kansas

An image of a deadly bullet wound to 
one's patient's head, uploaded to Wolf's Facebook in January was 
accompanied by a series of chilling comments, the paper says.

Responding to a fellow user who complained when asked to straighten the patient's head, Wolf allegedly wrote 'Sheesh Melissa, it's not like the patient was going to complain.'

Wolf also allegedly wrote macabre comments about another patient who received a gun wound to the head and survived. 

'One of my all-time favorites,' he allegedly wrote on the social media site. 'From my residency days ... there was a pretty active 'knife and gun club' at Truman Medical Center. What kind of gun blows someone's head completely off? I gotta get me one of those.'

He later added, 'It reminds [me] of the scene from Terminator 2 when they shoot the liquid metal terminator guy in the face at close range and it kind of splits him open temporarily almost like a flower blooming. We all find beauty in different things.'

Wolf, seen here in this Facebook photo taken at a Kansas City town hall, apologized for his online activity in a written statement on his website

On The WolfFiles.com, an X-ray was described as his '2nd favorite gunshot wound of all time'

TheWolfFiles.com, a political blog 
authored by Wolf, included a post on an X-ray of a gunshot wound, titled
 'My Guess: A Jealous Husband or a Jilted Lover.'

'This
 is my 2nd favorite gunshot wound of all time,' he wrote. 'I wish I 
could tell you the story behind this awesome X-ray, but this patient 
came through the ER and they don't believe in obtaining patient 
histories (I wish I was kidding). I'm guessing a jealous husband or a 
jilted lover. I mean...2 gunshot wounds...to the back.'

Wolf, when pressed by the paper, reportedly did not respond to questions asking if he continued to upload these types of photos online.

He then published an statement about the photos on his campaign website.

'Several years ago I made some comments about these images that were insensitive to the seriousness of what the images revealed. Soon thereafter, I removed those images and comments, again several years ago.'

Wolf seemed to imply that that rival Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS) was involved in the photos' recent release.

'For them to be published in a much more public context now, by a political adversary who would rather declare war on doctors than answer serious questions that Kansans have, is truly sad.  However, my mistakes are my own and I take full responsibility for them.'

Seen with his wife and children in this Facebook image, Wolf even allegedly referred to one of the graphic X-ray images he uploaded as 'One of my all-time favorites' and said 'We all find beauty in different things'

A spokesman for Roberts, Leroy Towns, expressed his concerns about Wolf's behavior to The Topeka Capital-Journal.

'For any doctor to make patient
 records public and then use the 
records for public discussion and entertainment is just unthinkable,' he
 said. 'Allegations of such lack of judgment demand extensive 
scrutiny and investigation.'

Twitter users have also criticized the would-be politician.

'There will always be jerks, but are we having a jerk-epidemic in our country?,' wrote one.

Another user said '#DrMiltonWolf, #SenateCandidate under fire for posting grisly images to Facebook, how stupid are you?'

'That Milton Wolf seems like one classy dude,' another user wrote, apparently sarcastically.

Wolf has been married to wife Karrie Wolf for 23 years and they have two children.

He has also mentioned that he is related to the president repeatedly when criticizing his health care plan in his book 'Do No Harm: The President's Cousin Explains Why His Hippocratic Oath Requires Him to Oppose ObamaCare.' He has also won support from groups associated with the Tea Party.

Roberts, despite having high marks with conservative watchdog groups like Heritage Action for America and FreedomWorks, has recently come under scrutiny for his actual residency, Politico reports.

A New York Times article revealed Roberts owns a Virginia home and is registered to vote at the address of two donors rather than his own Kansas property.
