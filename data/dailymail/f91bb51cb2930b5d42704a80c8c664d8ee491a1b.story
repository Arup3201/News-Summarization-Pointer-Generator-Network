Millions of shoppers will be hitting 
the shops and going online tomorrow as the biggest day in America’s festive
 shopping calendar arrives in the UK.

With
 discounts of up to 70 per cent on everything from plasma TVs to party 
shoes, it’s expected to get shoppers in the mood for buying and 
officially kick-off the pre-Christmas rush.

Known
 as Black Friday in the the US, it is the first full shopping day after 
their Thanksgiving holiday, and so named by retailers as it marks the 
first day in the financial year when they move out of the red and into 
the black.

Despite not 
celebrating Thanksgiving in the UK, Black Friday has been creeping over 
the Atlantic for the past few years, as international giants like Amazon
 and Apple seek to include UK customers in the shopping frenzy.

Currys & PC World's distribution warehouse, in Newark, Nottinghamshire is all stocked up for the rush of shoppers

The warehouse is one of the largest electrical distribution centres in Europe with over 1.5M square footage of warehouse space

Bargain-hunters are set to storm the shops tomorrow to take advantage of the American version of the Boxing Day sales

Indeed, Apple are having a Black Friday Extravaganza, where top-secret shopping savings will be unveiled.

Amazon
 are offering ‘lightning deals’ throughout the day, when shoppers have a
 fixed time in which to buy a limited number of goods at very low 
prices.

As more customers prefer to shop 
online rather than face the crush of other shoppers, Currys & PC 
World have seen that 40 per cent of site traffic is now from mobile or 
tablet devices as people buy 'on the go'.

Some estimates suggest more than 30million people – more
than half the population – will be browsing for gifts over this weekend.

And Britain leads the world in online 
Christmas shopping, a survey has found, with nearly nine in ten of us 
planning to buy some of our gifts on the internet this year.

The
 study, by PayPal, found 88 per cent of shoppers in Britain will log on 
for Christmas purchases.

This is compared with 86 per cent in the US and 84 per 
cent in Germany.

The UK was also ahead of Australia, Canada, France and Italy.

The rise of web shopping has been faster and more extensive
in the UK than any other country in the world, however it has dealt a serious
blow to traditional high streets.
