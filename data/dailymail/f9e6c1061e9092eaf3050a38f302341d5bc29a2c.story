In Wordsworth country, it is enough to inspire poetry. Above the clouds and silhouetted against a carpet of white, a runner enjoys perfect peace yesterday on 2,795ft Grasmoor in the Lake District

The atmospheric shots, taken by Stuart Holmes, 48, shows his friend Chris Scammell enjoying a jog up Grasmoor, a mountain in the north-western part of the Lake District, northern England.

The unique view is thanks to a meteorology phenomenon called inversion, which takes place when the temperature at a higher altitude is higher than at a lower altitude.

During a cloud inversion, such as in the Lake District yesterday, the clouds become a 'lid' where only the mountain tops poke out above them. 

The same phenomenon could be seen from the top of Mount Snowdon in North Wales today as the temperature on the top  reached 12 degrees while the foot of the mountain was four degrees.

Phenomenon: Inversion is created when the temperature at a higher altitude is higher than lower down, 'trapping' the clouds in between

The temperature on the top of Mount Snowdon, in this case 12 degrees, was warmer than the temperature on the foot of the mountains
