Bode Miller’s pregnant ex-lover claims she has forwarded messages sent to her by the Olympian’s wife to police as the custody battle over the skier’s unborn child escalates into an extraordinary war between the two women.

Miller, 35, launched his fight for joint legal and physical custody of Sara McKenna’s child just days after his wife, Morgan Beck, suffered a miscarriage.

Now in an increasingly vitriolic online exchange between McKenna and Miller’s wife of three months,  Beck brands her adversary a woman who lied about being on the Pill ‘to lock down a man who doesn’t want to be with her.’

Sara and Morgan pull no punches as one fights for her man and the other fights for her child

Joy: Sara announced her pregnancy on Facebook and proudly revealed what he planned to call the child

McKenna responds, ‘No Morgan, not even the pill is 100% effective when you are having unprotected sex.’

She today told TMZ, 'I will be fighting this in court and will not give up my son to somebody who did not want him to begin with.'

Messages posted by Beck on January 9 paint McKenna, 35, as a desperate woman who duped Miller by lying about being on the Pill. Beck threatens, ‘there will be a warrant for your arrest for kidnapping the moment you go into labor.’

At one point during the catty exchange McKenna states, ‘Now I’m going to cut this off since I sent your messages to a police officer. Your IP (Internet Provider) address gets tracked. Can’t deny your ID.’

McKenna is due to give birth next month, leaving little time between the conception of her child with Miller and his meeting professional volleyball player, Beck, in May last year.

The New Hampshire-born Miller married her five months later in a private ceremony on his boat in San Diego in October.

But already the storm with McKenna was brewing. Just weeks before his marriage, she posted, ‘Go take your paternity test already Bode. I’m over the way you have been treating us. You can’t hide DNA in court documents.’

On the same day McKenna posted a message directed at 25-year-old Beck: ‘If you make a fake Twitter to ask me questions about your new “fiance” at least be clever enough not to use your cat’s name #block.’

McKenna, who describes herself as a ‘Firefighter, helicopter pilot, former U.S Marine, model, Ivy Leaguer and future mommy,’ claims that Miller wanted nothing to do with the child when she first fell pregnant eight months ago.

Now she has made it clear that she has no intention of surrendering any rights to the child’s father.

In a clear show of solidarity with her husband earlier this month Beck informed McKenna: ‘You are stuck with BOTH of us for the rest of your life.’

Miller has also filed for joint legal and physical custody as well as child support payments for a child by another woman – Chanel Johnson.

Johnson, now married, is the mother of Miller’s four-year-old daughter Neesyn Dacey. According to Miller the two are friends and he was involved in naming the little girl. 

Miller has won five Olympic medals – including a gold at the 2010 Vancouver Games, holds four World Championships and 33 World Cup wins, which is an American men's record.

He recently announced his intention to sit this season out as he is recovering from knee surgery and determined to compete in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

Writing about his relationship with Johnson and their daughter in his personal journal on Universalsports.com on Friday, Miller insisted that he had never tried to keep the child a secret.

‘If someone asked I would talk about it,’ he said. ‘But no-one ever really brought it up. We were kind of already doing our own thing when Chanel found out she was pregnant.

'We are just really good friends trying to be good parents…I’m happy the way it is.’

The same cannot be said for the situation with McKenna.

High flying: The war between helicopter McKenna, left, and Miller's wife, a volleyball player, have become extremely bitter

Her tweets of her pregnancy progress – she has tweeted from the moment of the pregnancy test – must be particularly painful for Beck.

She posted the news of her miscarriage on Friday in this very public play by play.

The battle's impact on surrounding friendships is also clear.

Earlier this month McKenna could be found lambasting a friend for a perceived betrayal.

Yet only a few months before the women were excitedly exchanging details of the impending birth and telilng the world how delighted they were to be friends.

Collateral damage: Former friendships are falling by the wayside as McKenna pits herself against Miller and Beck

In September @Tehren_Anaiis tweets, 'i 
am so honoured to know such an amazing strong woman like 
@Sarah_A_McKenna can't wait to meet little bode babe!'

But only last month McKenna is accusing her friend of a 'back stab' by feeding information to Beck.

McKenna's agent did not respond to requests for comment.
