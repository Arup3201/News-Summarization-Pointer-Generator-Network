Researchers at Monash University, in collaboration with their spin out company Amaero, have created the world’s first 3D-printed jet engine, possibly revolutionising the design and cost of aerospace materials .

Amaero is already working with six tier-one air space companies, however, with the unit currently on display at Avalon International Air show, the engine is also capturing the attention of commercial outfitters like Boeing and Airbus.

David Lyster, Monash University Manger of Major Collaborations, told The Daily Mail Australia it’s a ‘very exciting time’ with overwhelming interest in the prototype and the possible capabilities of 3D printing.

Breakthrough: The 3D printer attracted interest of major manufacturers while on display at the Avalon International Air show in Melbourne, Australia. 

Scientists call it additive manufacturing but to you and I, its 3D laser printing. 

Most people are aware of how plastic printers work, the printer head runs back and forth dribbling plastic ink along the page, for metal printing it’s a whole different ball game.

Engineers start with a bed of fine powder which is laid down in a very thin base (40 micrometers). Once there is a uniform layer, a laser is used to melt the powder where they want to form a solid part of the structure. From there it’s only several thousand more layers of powder to go down before the product is complete.

Dirty work: The 3D printing process involves layers of very fine powder before a laser is used to form the solid structure 

Project leader and visionary, Professor Xinhua Wu, says most jet engines are very complex, taking up to 6-24 months to produce.

‘The benefit of 3D printing is we can cut down the manufacture time of those components to 1-2 weeks,’ says Professor Wu.

‘Simple or complex- 3D printing doesn’t care, it produces it in the same time’

Although Amaero are the owners of the biggest 3D printer in the world they say its unlikely the device would be used to print whole planes as it’s ideally suited to ‘highly complex and high value adding components.’ 

For this reason Dr Lyster can't see 3D printing is  replace mass produced products.

Dr Lyster told the Daily Mail Australia manufacturing turn around for smaller components will significantly reduce as process’ that once took up to 13 different manufacturing steps and 5-6 months to complete could be produced in as little as three stages and only five days.

Not only do we ‘improve functioning and decrease manufacturing cost,’ there is a huge reduction in waste as around 99-100% of the powder used ends up being used in the final product, unlike metal which ‘often ends up on the workshop floor,’ says Dr Lyster.

‘People are only just getting around the flexibility 3D printing provides,’ Dr Lyster says.

The research team set up spin off company Amaero two years ago, with a federal grant from Commercialisation Australia, to allow the manufacturing on Australian shores.

Lyster says the company’s relationship with multiple tier one air space companies has bought them to the forefront of strategic innovation, with the next challenge to establish Amearo as a world leader in 3D printing.

“A number of our companies really believe we can do what we are doing better than anyone else,” Dr Lyster told the Daily Mail Australia.

The sky is NOT the limit with Lyster’s sights set on entering the biomedical science sphere. Amaero is currently working with Australian and Chinese hospitals and staff looking for new and innovative ways of incorporating 3D printing into the medical world.

‘Demand for product development is so high Amaero is going to have to look at expanding,’ says Lyster.

He says now Amaero has comfortably made a mark in the aero industry he is very keen to start working with Australian manufacturers to expand into different industries like biomedical.

‘Our challenge now is engaging with the Australian community and exite them about the capabilities of the technology.'
