All cars in Australia could soon be fitted with a device that prevents drunk motorists getting behind the wheel and driving.

The bold prediction was made on Tuesday by Victorian Transport Minister Terry Mulder, who declared technological advances would mean the $1000 devices would one day be a permanent feature inside all new Australian vehicles sold.

The prediction, if acted on, could bring the high rate accidents and deaths caused by drunk motorists to zero. Working much like a standard police breath testing unit, interlocks register the amount of alcohol in the driver's blood and prevent the car from starting if a person reaches a certain limit.

Interlocking devices will be introduced into all Victorian vehicles by 2016

They also record the number of times offenders have tried to start their car while under the influence of alcohol. Minister Mulder said the revolutionary device would prevent drunks from putting lives at risk. Â

He delivered this prediction, that all Australian cars will be fitted with the device, while announcing new laws for Victoria that will require all drink-driving offenders to fork out $1000 to fit them in their cars by 2016.

He said Victoria is making the first step towards a blanket rule that would see every Australian car prevent their drivers from getting behind the wheel drunk.

Terry Mulder wants to see all cars in Australia one day fitted with interlocking devices preventing drunks from driving

Interlocks work by preventing the the car from being started unless the driver, who blows into the device, passes a breath test

'Technological advances mean that in the long-term alcohol interlocks are likely to be a standard feature of all new vehicles in Australia,' he said.

'But in the meantime, Victoria is leading the way in taking action to reduce the menace caused by drink driving offenders.'

Victorian police Minister Peter Ryan has backed a uniform law for interlocking devices to be fitted into Australian vehicles. 'The user-pays system ensures there's a powerful financial deterrent to drink-driving,' Mr Ryan said.

Minister Mulder said drink-drivers make up 25 to 30 percent of deaths and 11 percent of serious injuries on Victorian roads. Repeat drink-drivers make up 20 percent.

In October this year, first time drink-driving offenders in Victoria will find themselves paying top dollar for an interlocking unit if they are caught by police registering a reading of .07 or more.

Probationary drivers and those with a cancelled licence caught with readings of between .05 and .07 will also be required to fit them. By 2016, drink-drivers caught registering any alcohol in their blood, will be forced to have them installed.

Interlocking immobilisers also register the amount of times a person has blown a high reading

In October last year, the NSW Government announced similar legislation, which will soon come into affect.

Most laws in other states require drivers to fit the interlocking immobilisers if they have been caught twice within five years with blood-alcohol readings of 0.15 or above.

The Western Australian government only just this month passed legislation for repeat offenders to install breath-testing immobilisers for some of the state's worst repeat drink-driving offenders.

Mr Mulder, in introducing the new laws, said: 'the community has asked us to act on this. We are going to act on this and we are going to act in a very, very strong manner.'
