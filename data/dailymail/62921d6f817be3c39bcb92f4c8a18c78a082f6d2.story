A former child sex victim who became a paedophile hunter by posing online as a young girl watched yesterday as an office worker who fell for her sting was jailed for almost two years.

Samantha Roberts, 20, who was lured to a house and raped by an Asian gang when she was 12, set up fake profiles to ensnare middle-aged men using a teenage chatroom to prey on young girls.

By using digital technology to alter the sound of their voices, she and her boyfriend – dubbed a  ‘paedophile hunter’ by police – convinced the men that they were talking to schoolgirls before handing the evidence to detectives.

Yesterday Lee Barton, 47, a team leader at a rail infrastructure firm, was jailed for 21 months by a judge who branded him ‘a parent’s worst nightmare’.

He had messaged one of the duo’s alter egos saying he wanted to ‘do stuff’ to her, while a second man caught by Miss Roberts asked one of the ‘girls’ to perform a sex act.

in sexual activity

Judge Timothy Mort said the case highlighted how the internet made youngsters vulnerable to grooming, saying: ‘It is obviously a worry for parents whose children are using these teenage chatrooms as to who is getting in touch with them.’

But following the rise of vigilante groups such as Letzgo Hunting, detectives last night warned people worried about child abuse not to take the law into their own hands.

Miss Roberts had been walking home in Oldham in 2007 when Shakil Chowdhury lured her into his car before taking her to a house where she was plied with alcohol and repeatedly raped by the 39-year-old and three other men. Chowdhury was jailed for six years, and Miss Roberts later waived her right to anonymity to campaign for tougher sentences for paedophiles.

Last year she and boyfriend Steven Walker, 24, began examining US-based chatroom teen-chat.org, which is aimed at 13 to 19-year-olds, over fears that paedophiles were using it to groom potential victims.

They set up fake profiles including ‘Chloe12’ and ‘Aleshia13’, and in April last year Walker contacted Aleshia asking for a private conversation. He claimed to be 18 and made sexually explicit suggestions to the girl.

Despite the pair’s ‘coy’ and ‘non-committal’ responses, he asked to meet up so they could ‘do stuff’, including ‘maybe a f*** if you want to’, Philip Curran, prosecuting, told Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester.

The pair were sentenced at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, today

Speaking via their computer’s microphone but using a synthesiser so Mr Walker’s voice sounded like a girl’s, they gave Barton a phone number and he called to ask ‘whether she was on her own’ and what time her parents would be home.

At that point, Miss Roberts told Barton that the conversation was being recorded and the pair’s  evidence was handed to police.

Smartly dressed in a grey suit and holding his head in his hands, Barton, from Doncaster, was jailed for 21 months after pleading guilty to attempting to arrange or facilitate the commission of a child sex offence and attempting to engage a child in sexual activity.

He was also handed a five-year sexual offences prevention order.

A second man, 36-year-old Daniel Bates, of Warrington, Cheshire, contacted ‘Chloe12’ in April last year and asked her to perform a sex act on herself.

Wheelchair-bound Bates – who  suffers from cerebral palsy and learning difficulties – was given a 15-month sentence suspended for 18 months after admitting attempting to engage a child in sexual activity. He was also made the subject of a prevention order.

Earlier this year Philip Moule, 66, of Basildon, Essex, was given a three-year community order for offences arising out of their pair’s sting.

After yesterday’s hearing, Miss Roberts said: ‘I’m happy about the first sentence but appalled at the second one, I think it is ridiculous.’

Detective Sergeant John Coleman, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘We strongly encourage people not to take the law into their own hands and to contact the police at the earliest possible time.’
