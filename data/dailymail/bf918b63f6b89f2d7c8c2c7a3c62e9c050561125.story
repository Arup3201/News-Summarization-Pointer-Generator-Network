A hapless team of Muslim cyber terrorists whose aim is to hack websites belonging to the world's biggest governments and businesses have mistakenly hijacked Bristol's online bus timetable.

A group calling themselves Darkshadow - an 'Arab Security Team' - took over the TravelWest website and replaced it with a sinister Islamic State-style homepage.

It is believed the gang though it was an influential site used by millions to book travel around the Western world - not a West Country journey planner.

Blunder: A gang of Muslim hackers, believed to be based in Tunisia, hacked a West Country bus timetable site believing it was an influential journey planner used across the Western world 

Its users were shocked on New Year's Day when they tried to find out the latest bus and rail times but were met with a black Islamic banner with the message 'hacked by darkshadow', 'Muslum (sic) hackers'.

However, rather than bringing the West to the brink of meltdown, it briefly deprived users of travel and congestion information in the Bristol area. 

Arabic music often used on propaganda films used by groups like ISIS also blasted out of their speakers.

The small-scale attack was roundly mocked by bus and rail users via the group’s Facebook page. 

Several people began contacting the hackers asking them for travel advice in and around Bristol but are yet to get a response.

The site is now back in the hands of TravelWest after bus and train travellers were unable to access the timetables throughout New Year's Day.

The 'darkshadow' group's Facebook page claims they have previously successfully infiltrated webpages belonging to Philippine Airlines and the El Salvador government.

But their latest botched attack has been mocked by people via their Facebook page.

Spot the difference: West Country travel bosses have since managed to wrestle back control of the TravelWest site

Upset: People wanting to find out the best way around Bristol on New Year's Day were shocked to see an Islamic black flag when they tried to log on

Warning: When users Google TravelWest they still get the message that it has been hacked

Facebook user Richard Moore wrote: ‘These idiots are the laughing stock of the world. Are the buses running today?’

Another called Saki Piranha commented: ‘Can you fix this little error on the TravelWest site? Nice music by the way.’

One person asked: 'Hi. Can you tell me which bus to get from the station to travel to the city centre? It seems as though you're now giving travel information'.

One person wrote: 'Oh dear, can't tell the difference between a local bus company and travel site! Pathetic.'

Jenny Johnson added: 'It's a  bus timetable website. Too hard to hack something big.' 

The TravelWest website usually provides locals with information about train and bus times in and around Bristol.

The Facebook page left on the jammed site says the hackers are based in the Tunisian capital of Tunis in North Africa.

They appear to target two or three global travel websites all over the world every day.

As well as posting their triumphs, the group also upload a series of posts praising Allah.

One said: 'Swear to god but Allah is the Almighty God and his prophets is Muhamad.'
