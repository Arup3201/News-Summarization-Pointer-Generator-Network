The U.S. power sector must cut carbon dioxide emissions 30 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels under federal regulations unveiled on Monday that form the centerpiece of the Obama administration's climate change strategy.

The Environmental Protection Agency's proposal is one of the most significant environmental rules proposed by the United States, and could transform the power sector, which relies on coal for nearly 38 percent of electricity. It also set off a political backlash likely to run well into next year.

Gina McCarthy, EPA administrator, said on Monday that between 2020 and 2030, the amount of carbon dioxide the proposal would reduce would be more than double the carbon pollution from the entire U.S. power sector in 2012.

Big change: The EPA officially unveiled a plan Monday that will force power plants to reduce carbon emissions by 30 percent by 2030

States will have flexible means to achieve ambitious but attainable targets, regardless of their current energy mixes. States which rely heavily on coal-fired power plants are thought to have the toughest tasks ahead.

'The flexibility of our Clean Power Plan affords states the choices that lead them to a healthier future. Choices that level the playing field, and keep options on the table, not off,' McCarthy said in remarks at EPA headquarters on Monday.

The plan had come under pre-emptive attack from business groups and many Republican lawmakers as well as Democrats from coal-heavy states like West Virginia before it was unveiled.

But the 645-page plan looked less restrictive than some had feared, with targets easier to reach because emissions had already fallen by about 10 percent by 2013 from the 2005 baseline level, partly due to retirement of coal plants in favor of cleaner-burning natural gas.

The plan 
gives states multiple options to achieve their emission targets, such as
 improving power plant heat rates; using more natural gas plants to 
replace coal plants; ramping up zero-carbon energy, such as solar or 
nuclear; and increasing energy efficiency.

States can also use measures such as carbon cap-and-trade systems as a way to meet their goals.

Short sighted? U.S. President Barack Obama is photographed through the window as he speaks on the phone in the Oval Office during a conference call hosted by the American Lung Association to find ways to reduce carbon pollution from power plants. The new EPA rules ushered in Monday will continue to affect power producers long after he leaves office  

Monday's rules cap months of outreach by the EPA and White House officials to an array of interests groups.

The country's roughly 1,000 power plants, which account for nearly 40 percent of U.S. carbon emissions, face limits on carbon pollution for the first time.

Climate change is a legacy issue for President Barack Obama, who has struggled to make headway on foreign and domestic policy goals since his re-election.

But major hurdles remain. The EPA's rules are expected to stir legal challenges on whether the agency has overstepped its authority. A 120-day public comment period follows the rules' release.

The 
National Association of Manufacturers, a long-time EPA foe, argued on 
Monday that the power plant plan was 'a direct threat' to its members' 
competitiveness.

The
 electric utility industry, encompassing plants that use resources from 
coal and natural gas to wind was more circumspect about the plan.

'While
 the 2030 reduction target is ambitious, it appears that utilities may 
be allowed to take advantage of some of their early actions,' the Edison
 Electric Institute said.

Lawmakers representing big coal states lashed out.

Mitch
 McConnell of Kentucky, Republican leader in the U.S. Senate, termed the
 rules a 'dagger to the heart of the middle class' that would damage the
 economy.

Republicans
 are trying to wrest control of the Senate from Democrats in November's 
elections. Four of the states with Senate seats in play are among the 
top 10 coal producers nationally: West Virginia, Kentucky, Montana and 
Colorado.

Obama,
 on a conference call with public health groups, said Americans' 
electricity bills would shrink, not rise, as the rules spur investment 
in new technologies.

The EPA's McCarthy also forecast that the regulations could yield over $90 billion dollars in climate and health benefits.

 and smog reductions that would be achieved through the plan would 
translate into a $7 health benefit for every dollar invested in the 
plan, she said.

The
 EPA estimates that reducing exposure to particle pollution and ozone 
could prevent up to 150,000 asthma attacks in children and as many as 
3,300 heart attacks by 2030, among other impacts.

The
 rules, when finalized, could give Washington more clout in 
international talks next year to develop a framework for fighting 
climate change. The United States is eager for emerging industrial 
economies such as China and India to do more to reduce their emissions.

Lashing out: Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Republican leader in the U.S. Senate, termed the rules a 'dagger to the heart of the middle class' that would damage the economy. McConnell's state is one of the top coal-burning states in the U.S.

STATES MOST RELIANT ON COAL FOR ELECTRICITY

KENTUCKY: Not surprisingly, the proposal is widely unpopular in Kentucky, which gets 92 percent of its electricity from coal — more than any other state except West Virginia — and is the nation's third-largest coal producer. 'Why keep chopping the legs out of your own economy to fight a world problem?' asks Gary Whitt, a railroad worker whose job depends on coal shipments.

INDIANA: Gov. Mike Pence and a state manufacturers' group say the plan would cost Indiana — which generates 80 percent of its power from coal and is perched atop a gigantic vein — jobs and business growth while boosting ratepayer costs that are among the nation's lowest. Purdue University researcher Doug Gotham says replacing aging coal-fired plants with natural gas burners will help.

STATES THAT PRODUCE THE MOST COAL

WYOMING: Fighting the feds is nothing new in a state participating in a dozen lawsuits against the Environmental Protection Agency over air emissions. Gov. Matt Mead says he's reviewing the proposal and will 'fight for coal' if necessary. Wyoming leads the country in coal production with nearly 40 percent, and Wyoming Mining Association director Jonathan Downing says it can be a clean energy source.

WEST VIRGINIA: Democrats and Republicans may agree on little else in the No. 2 coal-producing state, which also gets almost all its power from coal, but opposition to the EPA plan is bipartisan. Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin says none of the state's coal plants is close to meeting the proposed standard, although companies say they're cutting emissions.

STATES REQUIRED TO MAKE THE BIGGEST CUTS

WASHINGTON: The plan demands a 72 percent cut in coal usage, a far higher rate than any other state. But it helps that in this hydro-rich state, just 3 percent of electricity is coal-generated. Gov. Jay Inslee praises Obama for his leadership on carbon pollution, while officials note that a voter-approved law requires the largest utilities to get more power from renewable sources.

SOUTH CAROLINA: State government and power companies say the federal order to cut coal emissions by 51 percent is surprisingly harsh. But more than half of South Carolina's power comes from nuclear plants and that will increase after two units under construction go online.

LEADING USERS OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY

COLORADO: The administration describes Colorado as a poster child in the push to cut carbon emissions, praising its requirements for utilities to step up use of renewable energy sources; the state gets 11 percent of its power from wind. But coal remains the biggest electricity provider, and the plan seeks a 35 percent cut by 2030.

CALIFORNIA: Coal is a bit player in the most populous state's energy portfolio, so few are complaining about the EPA order to reduce emissions by 23 percent. California gets more power from wind, biomass, geothermal, hydro and solar than from coal, and its providers are required to generate one-third of their electricity from renewables by 2020. 'While others delay and deny, the Obama administration is confronting climate change head-on with these new standards,' Gov. Jerry Brown says.
