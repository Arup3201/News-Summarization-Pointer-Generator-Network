When junior doctor Ed Holloway took time off sick, colleagues were happy to cover for him.

But after he returned to work with a suntan – even though the weather at home had been miserable – they became suspicious.

However, it was when one of them recognised his voice on the TV commentary for a show-jumping event in the US that they realised they had fallen for an audacious con.

Far from being at home recovering from his illness, the urologist had been moonlighting by making TV appearances at top eventing competitions.

Moonlighting: Ed Holloway on screen. After he returned to work from sick leave with a suntan – even though the weather at home had been miserable – his colleagues became suspicious

Mr Holloway was sacked and has now been struck off after a disciplinary panel ruled his repeated dishonesty was ‘fundamentally incompatible’ with working as a doctor.

In an interview for an Australian broadcaster in 2011, in which he claimed he was also a qualified lawyer, Mr Holloway agreed his commentary career was ‘a labour of love’, saying he did television work at Burghley and Badminton as well as in Poland, Sweden and ‘about six events’ in the US.

Asked why with the ‘enormous amount of commitment’ to qualifying for medicine he was still commentating, he replied: ‘I love the commentary – my mother asks the same question regularly.’

Mr Holloway also joked the idea of treating patients was ‘scary’ compared to commentating.

A panel at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service heard he continued to moonlight as a commentator in 2012 despite securing a post as a junior urologist at Scunthorpe General Hospital.

He took sick leave around weekends and even showed up after one ‘spell of illness’ with a suntan in late September, despite the miserable UK weather, the panel heard. He was forced to admit the truth after a colleague recognised his voice from the Horse and Country channel, being shown on Sky.

When challenged, the panel heard Mr Holloway told managers he had been ‘stupid’ but had not been in ‘a great place’, adding that he was ‘sorry and ashamed’.

He was sacked in April last year after a Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust investigation found he had been commentating on events when he had claimed to be off sick between September and November 2012.

The University of Leicester graduate took time off to attend an event at Plantation Field, Philadelphia. He also commentated in Boekelo, in the Netherlands and missed work while on a flight from California.

He admitted one count of fraud at Scunthorpe Magistrates Court in July 2013, was fined £700 and ordered to repay an overpayment of his salary of £708.35.

Mr Holloway, who has been suspended from practising since June last year, had hoped to convince the Manchester panel to let him resume medicine.

But chairman Carrie Ryan-Palmer told him his repeated dishonesty was ‘fundamentally incompatible’ with working as a doctor and ‘illustrated a deep seated desire to place your own interests above those of your patients and demonstrated a cavalier attitude to patient safety’.

‘The panel determined that your behaviour, repeated dishonesty, lack of insight and lack of remediation are fundamentally incompatible with your continuing to practise medicine,’ she said.

The decision to strike him off the medical register was taken last week but announced yesterday.

Mr Holloway has the right to appeal within the next month.
