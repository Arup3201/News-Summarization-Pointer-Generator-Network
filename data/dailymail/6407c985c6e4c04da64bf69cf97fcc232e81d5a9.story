Ed Balls today revealed he has been grilled by his wife Yvette Cooper about his bloody football match clash which left a rival player needing stitches.

The shadow chancellor rejected claims from former top referee Graham Poll who said he was lucky not to have been sent off after elbowing Northern Echo reporter Rob Merrick in the face.

Miss Cooper, the shadow home secretary, demanded to know 'what went on' after the incident, and joked that it undermines her determination to be 'tough on anti-social behaviour'.

Mr Balls insisted there were no hard feelings, and he and Mr Merrick remain 'good friends' despite the clash

The nasty clash occurred during the traditional pre-conference football match between Labour and political journalists.

The pair were contesting a 50-50 ball on the edge of the Lobby penalty area when a stray elbow from Mr Balls left a slash under the reporter's right eye.

Mr Merrick had to leave the pitch for medical treatment as blood covered his shirt - but later returned to be named man-of-the-match.

Challenged about the incident today, Mr Balls admitted his wife had demanded an explanation: 'Yvette saw those pictures and said 'what went on'?' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

Mr Balls added: 'It was a clash, a coming together. It was n malice. It wasn't even a foul. We didn't even know it had happened.

'The referee not only said it wasn't a foul, but everybody else knew it wasn't a foul. It was a complete accident.

'Rob and I, we're good friends, there's not hard feeling between us. But I have to say to you it's not a good picture.'

However, former top referee Graham Poll insisted he should have been sent off. 'Had I been refereeing this match, I would have certainly voted Yes for a straight red card for Ed Balls.

‘As the pictures show, Ed deliberately brought his arm and elbow into the face of Rob Merrick – a clear foul and an obvious sending off.

‘But if you need further evidence, you only need to look at the blood that flowed after the incident.

‘Not only did we have a man representing the red of the Labour Party – his challenge left plenty of red on his opponent’s shirt and that’s why my card definitely would have been red for Ed.’

Photographs of the elbowing have been circulated online and appeared on the front pages of several newspapers today.

Miss Cooper, who is in charge of Labour's policy on law and order, suggested the violence could be a setback for the party's stance against thuggery.

She told a Labour List conference rally: 'Some of you may have seen the photographs of Ed and his encounter on a football match earlier.

'When he came back he said, 'well, there was a bit of an incident - a journalist ran into my arm. Well, all right, so he ran into my elbow ...with his eye'.'

She told the audience: 'So when you see the photographs of all the blood and the grimaces… it does rather undermine my determination to be tough on anti-social behaviour.'

The Labour team - which featured a host of frontbench stalwarts including Andy Burnham, Jim Murphy and Sadiq Khan - eventually suffered the pain of a 3-1 defeat.

Graeme Demianyk of the Western Morning News opened the scoring by bundling home from close range, before the Financial Times's George Parker doubled the advantage.

But a strike from political aide Dave Hodges sparked a shaky spell from the Lobby, and it took a goal from Matt Dathan of The Times to settle the issue.

It is the second year running the Labour team has been defeated in the conference showdown, which is supported by the Football Association and helps raise funds for charity.
