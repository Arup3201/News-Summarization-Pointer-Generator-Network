Samantha Cameron appeared to be moved to tears as her husband used his speech to launch a passionate defence of the National Health Service

Aides said the Prime Minister had discussed with his wife whether to include the passage in his speech and that Samantha was 'very strongly and personally passionate' about the need to discuss the NHS and its effect on their lives

In a highly-charged attack, he said: 'From Labour last week, we heard the same old rubbish about the Conservatives and the NHS.

'Spreading complete and utter lies. I just think: how dare you. It was the Labour Party who gave us the scandal at Mid Staffs elderly people begging for water and dying of neglect.

'And for me, this is personal. I am someone who has relied on the NHS – whose family knows more than most how important it is who knows what it's like to go to hospital night after night with a child in your arms knowing that when you get there, you have people who will care for that child and love that child like their own.

'How dare they suggest I would ever put that at risk for other people's children? How dare they frighten those who are relying on the NHS right now? It might be the only thing that gets a cheer at their Party conference but it is frankly pathetic.' 

Aides said Mr Cameron had discussed with his wife whether to include the passage in his speech and that Samantha was 'very strongly and personally passionate' about the need to discuss the NHS and its effect on their lives. 

Earlier he invoked the memory of Ivan as he made a personal commitment to more spending on the NHS.

Ivan, who suffered from cerebral palsy and epilepsy, died in 2009 at the age of just six.

Mr Cameron recalled the agony of not knowing what was wrong with son Ivan, who died in 2009, as he commits to more NHS spending

Mr Cameron backed increased investment into DNA research, recalling the agony of not knowing what was wrong with Ivan.

He said: 'From the country that unravelled DNA, we are now mapping it for each individual.

'Cracking this code could mean curing rare genetic diseases and saving lives. Our NHS is leading the world on this incredible technology.

'I understand very personally the difference it could make. When you have a child who's so ill and the doctors can't work out what he's got or why - you'd give anything to know.

'The investment we're making will mean that more patients have those answers - and hopefully the cures that go with them.'

Mr Cameron has often referred to his personal debt to the NHS, having spent many hours sleeping on floors in wards at Ivan's bedside.
