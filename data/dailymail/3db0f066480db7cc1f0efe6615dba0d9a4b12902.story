England will be looking to restore some pride and record their first win of the Autumn Internationals when they take on Samoa at Twickenham on Saturday.

Stuart Lancaster has made five changes to the side beaten by South Africa last week with George Ford coming in at fly-half. Follow our live coverage from 6.30pm.

Disappointing final quarter from England. Lancaster's side didn't kick on after May's second try.

Some big positives for England most notably Ford's performance at number 10 and their pack is one of the best in the business.

There are still big issues with the attack while the midfield make-up remains an issue.

Next week's game against Australia will be a fascinating watch.

 

 

Well deserved for the Quins skipper. Conditions and the opposition dictated a physical approach and you will always be guaranteed that from Robshaw 

It's all gone a bit flat in this final quarter at Twickenham 

Too many subs have stopped momentum and I'm disappointed with Farrell coming off. He needed every minute and subs have cost momentum 

The Twickenham crowd appear to be unimpressed by Owen Farrell's recent performances for England, judging by their reaction to his departure.

For the second successive week, the home fans have loudly cheered the announcement that the Saracens player was being replaced - this time by Billy Twelvetrees.

In truth, he was better this time, but still not back up to normal match sharpness.

Owen Farrell leaves the pitch to be be replaced by Billy Twelvetrees. Hasn't been an easy night for the Saracens fly half. 

One heartening aspect of England's improved performance since half-time is that they have started being smarter with their decision-making.

Mike Brown's try stemmed from a cross-kick by George Ford that was flat and fast, to prevent the cover defence drifting across quickly enough to snuff out the danger, while Anthony Watson was wise to off-load rather than showing the winger's instinct to lunge for the line himself.

For Jonny May's try, England sensibly used their pack to drive a rolling maul into the Samoan 22, dragging in defenders and thus creating the space for an overlap.

England capitalise on their extra man almost immediately. Quick hands from Attwood, Robshaw, Marler and Brown releases May for his second try in the left corner. 

Ford fails with the touchline conversion. 

Ford copped a massive hit from Sale Sharks centre Jonny Leota. It seemed a bit high but looks a harsh call. 

England have a one-man advantage for 10 minutes 

Tusi Pisi knocks over another three-pointer for the visitors. Samoa holding on, but only just.

That’s more like it! Ford stabs a beautiful cross-kick to Anthony Watson who offloads to Mike Brown and the Harlequins full back crashes over for England’s second try.

Ford converts and England are up and running in the second half.

Must get some real basics back into the game. I really want to see our kicking game work with 10/12 putting us into good positions. I want to see territory dominated by England 

Perfect start to the second half. England go through the phases and Samoa lock Kane Thompson is penalised for going off his feet at the ruck.

Ford makes no mistake from the tee to open up a two-score gap.

That was grim. The conditions have made an already disjointed encounter awful to watch. The crowd have become decidedly restless before half-time.

In the absence of any dynamic rugby, spectators at logo-laden Twickenham are being 'treated' to a rolling display of tweets, pictures of fans and sponsored statistics on the myriad electronic screens.

Amid the corporate over-load, all anyone present wants is some enthralling action to savour.

Ford's long range penalty falls short on the stroke of half-time. The rain is bucketing down at Twickenham.

Jonny May's try has been the highlight of a scrappy, error-strewn first 40 minutes from England. 

Ford has had some bright moments and the set piece is going well, but England's attacking shape is still looking lateral and predictable. 

This is how England can build a score to win this game - turn the screw up front in the set piece contest.

Their scrum was always likely to be dominant and that is proving to be the case, so in the absence of any great conviction in other areas, and with the rain coming down, they can grind this out.

It might not be pretty, but it is legitimate and they simply must win. Style is a secondary target tonight.

Another monster scrum from the England pack has Samoa in all sorts of trouble. Ford steps up to increase the home side's lead. Great play from Marler, Webber and Wilson. 

Tusi Pisi makes no mistake this time as Samoa eat into England's lead. 

England would have been bracing themselves for defensive physicality from the Samoans and that is certainly what they've faced so far. The visitors' abrasive tackling has shaken Stuart Lancaster's side, with Filo Paulo's brutal hit on George Ford setting the damaging tone.

So far, Samoa are the side showing more cohesion. England are relying on individual bursts of pace and footwork, but their midfield is cluttered and static, and their passing is ordinary.

England's discipline has disappointing. First Haskell and now Brown. Farrell needs to stay out of the rucks unless he is totally required.

There are a lot of forwards stood out wide in the backline; they need to get closer to the rucks and go route one into the Samoan defence.

Ford runs a great loop with Farrell and plays in Mike Brown who releases Gloucester flyer Jonny May into space and he finishes next to the posts. Ford adds the extras to settle England down. 

England squeeze a penalty out of the Samoans at scrum time. Ford steps up to draw his side level. That's a bit better from the home side. 

Tusi Pisi misses a shot right in front from 30 metres out after James Haskell was penalised for hands in the ruck. That would have given the visitors a well deserved 6-0 lead. A let off for England. 

9min: England playing with plenty of endeavour early on but Samoa very much enjoying knocking their runners back. 

Another big Samoan hit again. This time on England winger Anthony Watson 

England on the attack here but George Ford gets clattered by Samoa lock Filo Paulo. 

Tusi Pisi has a chance to give Samoa an early lead 

'Sweet Chariot' rings out around Twickenham as the Samoans lay down their challenge to Chris Robshaw and co 

Fans of the Aviva Premiership will recognise several of Samoa's startling line-up with includes the Pisi brothers and Kahn Fotuali'i from Northampton and Wasps three-quarter Alapati Leiua. 

All eyes will be on England new 10-12 axis this evening

Lancaster has shifted Owen Farrell to inside centre to accommodate George Ford at fly half. The pair rose through the underage ranks together as a formidable 10-12 partnership but this is the first time they have started at Test match alongside each other.

How will the pair cope against the super physical Samoans tonight? Kick-off is 15 minutes away...

The England squad have arrived at Twickenham. This is a must-win game for Lancaster's men 

Head coach Stuart Lancaster has swung the axe following two disappointing displays against New Zealand and South Africa in recent weeks. Billy Vunipola and Danny Care Care have been the biggest casualties with both players dropping out of the matchday squad altogether.

England are looking to get their QBE internationals campaign back on tract against Samoa at Twickenham this evening.
