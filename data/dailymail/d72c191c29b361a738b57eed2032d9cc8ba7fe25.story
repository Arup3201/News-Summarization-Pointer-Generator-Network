It's not just luxury sailing vessels that are being exhibited at this year's Monaco Yacht Show.

Instead, a wide variety of high-tech water gadgets are now being offered to the crowds of discerning millionaires attending the prestigious event.

If the wealthy customers ever get bored of sunning themselves on the decks of their mammoth gin palaces, they can splash out personal submarines, jetpacks, even a 'walking' boat.

The £110,000 Jetlev-Flyer - a water-powered 'jetpack' that can hover up to 30 metres in the air

Top of the shopping list is the Jetlev-Flyer – a water-powered 'jetpack' that can hover up to 30 metres in the air and reach speeds of up to 22mph.

Designed by Canadian engineer Raymond Li over ten years, the device costs £110,000.

The contraption is connected to a 10-metre hose which sucks up water before it is spat out through two nozzles. 

The machine can be used for up to three hours at a time, while the engine also doubles as a flotation device.

It is one of dozens of high-end accessories being sold by Superyacht Toys & Tenders, who have a stall at this year's event.

Around 200 of the water-based jetpacks have been sold across the world, with the company's managing director Josh Richardson explaining: 'Generally people are getting more adventurous with their luxury toys.'

Also on sale is the $1.7m (£1.03m) DeepFlight Super Falcon, a submersible similar to the one used in the 1981 James Bond film For Your Eyes Only.

At 21ft-long with a wingspan of 9ft, the futuristic-looking craft can reach depths of 400ft and speed through the ocean at nearly seven miles per hour.

It is able to do barrel rolls underwater, dive straight down, or make sharp turns.

It was created by British inventor Graham Hawkes who also developed the machine used in the film starring Roger Moore.

The submarine, which has been described as the 'Lear Jet of the seas, has a carbon fibre hull that encompasses two cockpits with dual flight controls. It can also remain underwater for 24 hours.

'Just as private individuals are now able to explore space, we see our submarines as opening up the oceans for private exploration,' said Karen Hawkes, who founded the DeepFlight company with engineer husband Graham in 1996. 

'Except unlike spacecraft, these owners get to the pilot their own vessels.'

The Triton deep sea mini-submarine is another underwater device proving popular with the super-rich.

The three-metre-long, two-man craft has been specifically designed for mega-yachts and comes with a hefty $2m (£1.2m) pricetag.

It is powered by four thrusters and has a top speed of 2.5 knots when submerged. There is enough air on board for a 12-hour trip and it can dive to a depth of 1,000ft.

The 3.3ton high-density acrylic bubble gives a 360-degree view of the deep, while the luxurious cockpit has air-con and leather-lined seats.

'It gives clients the opportunity to see a part of our planet that no human has ever visited before,' said Marc Depp, the company's sales and marketing manager. 

'Many of our clients are also concerned about their legacy and the condition of the oceans, and make their submarines available to marine scientists.'

The company currently build between four and six submarines a year.

The Iguana yacht is another contraption that the wealthy elite might be tempted to shell out for.

It's an amphibious boat-car with retractable caterpillar tracks that enables it to be driven in and out of the water.

The Iguana can reach a brisk 35 knots at sea thanks to its big 300hp engine, and costs £190,000

Designed by Frenchmen Tanguy le Bihan and Antoine Fritsch Associés, the Iguana can reach a brisk 35 knots at sea thanks to its big 300hp engine.

On land it can only move at 5mph because it relies on a smaller engine out of the water.

It has room for 10 people on board and features a teak floor, table and sundeck.

The craft costs a cool £190,000.

'All of our customers bought the yacht because they have a legitimate use for it, such as entering or exiting a waterfront property,' said the company's sales manager Steve Huppert. 

'We haven't had people buying it simply to show off.'

The Monaco Boat show is one of the most upmarket boat shows in the world and has a strict entry policy for the exhibiting companies.

The Monaco Boat Show show was launched 24 years ago and attracts an average of 33,000 people each year

Up to 500 companies in the luxury yachting world are able to showcase the latest high-tech nautical products and luxury yachting services, while 105 spectacular super and megayachts are exhibited every year.

The show, which was launched 24 years ago, attracts an average attendance of 33,000 people.

The show's managing director Gaëlle Tallarida said: 'Fifteen years ago a person who owned a superyacht was usually 50 years old. Now we're seeing people who are 30 years old owning one.

'These toys attract them because they have a special way of enjoying yachts, compared to their parents who perhaps had to wait until they were older to buy one. 

'They like sports and really enjoy being in the sea -- not just sailing and lying on the sundeck.'
