The Pacu Jawi is a curious Indonesian festival which sees fearless competitors dragged through muddy paddy fields while clinging onto the tails of two charging cows.

The animals are outfitted with a rudimentary wooden contraption and the jockeys can often find themselves stretched to the extreme as the beasts pull apart in opposite directions.

With their hands busy holding on tight, jockeys encourage their steeds to go faster by biting their tails.

The Pacu Jawi is an age old Indonesian festival which sees fearless competitors dragged through the mud while clinging onto the tails of two charging cows

The tradition has been around for hundreds of years and celebrates the end of the rice harvest season.

The raucous occasion allows sellers to show off their bulls to potential buyers, with race winners expecting to receive as much as double the money for their prized cattle.

The event is also used as a way to plough the land and is a celebration of harvest, but it is notoriously difficult for photographers to safely take pictures of the event, making these snaps all the more impressive.

Holding on for dear life: During the event 'jockeys' grip onto the animals' tails as they race through the mud

Risky business: In order to capture these dramatic moments, photographer Jefri Tarigan risked being trampled by the oncoming cows

Photographer Jefri Tarigan, from Indonesia, risked his life to get these dramatic shots during the recent race at Tanah Datar, West Sumatra.

Jefri put himself right in front of the animals, who were hurtling towards him. He said: 'I was terrified of being trampled. The difficulty is avoiding the cow that's running straight towards you while trying to take pictures.

'To get a good pictures I had to be alongside the cows or right in front of them so it was very difficult and dangerous.

Multi-purpose: The somewhat bizarre event is also used as a unique way to plough the land at the end of the rice harvest season

Doing the splits: Balancing on just a rudimentary wooden frame competitors career across muddy paddy fields, getting pulled in all directions

Spectator sport: People gather on the edges of the  paddy fields to watch farmers speeding through the mud

'If you don't know what you're doing it's very likely you'll get hurt.

'The event is highly anticipated so the atmosphere is fantastic. Tourists come a long way just to see it.

'No one was injured this time but the greatest risk is when a a jockey falls over or a cow decides to run off the track.'

Wet and wild: Competitors are even encouraged to bite the animals' tails to make them speed up 

Going bull-throttle: The atmosphere at the highly anticipated event is electric, with tourists coming from miles around just to witness it 

Jefri said: 'Spectators are taught to stand in a certain position and simultaneously raise their hands so if this does happen it encourages the cow to go back onto the track again.

'It's an incredible experience but also a frightening one.'
