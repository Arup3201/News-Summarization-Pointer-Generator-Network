Moments after the Dallas Cowboys finished burying the Jacksonville Jaguars 31-17 at Wembley Stadium, 80,000 poppies were supposed to rain down from the sky and cover the pitch in honour of Remembrance Day.

It may be just as well that didn’t happen because for the Jaguars, who will be returning to Wembley next October to host the Buffalo Bills, the finish of Sunday’s game is a moment they’ll likely want to forget.

The Jaguars briefly held a 7-3 first quarter lead before a botched play on special teams led to the Cowboys scoring a touchdown and taking an advantage they would not relinquish.

Dallas head coach Jason Garrett said that sequence of events ‘really swung the tide’.

‘I think we played a pretty solid football game after that,’ he said. ‘Making stops on defence, moving the ball, throwing it, and getting the running game going.’

After getting up by seven, Dallas seemed content to let Jacksonville hang around until quarterback Tony Romo hit Dez Bryant with a second quarter touchdown pass that put the Cowboys up 17-7 after the extra point.

The Cowboys didn’t look back after opening up the double-digit lead and kept the Jaguars off the board until Jacksonville secured a safety in the fourth quarter when the outcome of the game was no longer in doubt.

Romo finished his day with 246 passing yards and three touchdowns before being replaced by backup Brandon Weeden. Bryant caught two of those touchdowns and had 158 receiving yards on the day, a season high.

Dez Bryant had a memorable day at Wembley

Many of the 83,603 fans at Wembley attempted to cheer on the Jaguars, but the team simply did not have the horses to keep up with a Cowboys team that appears playoff-bound.

The Cowboys will fly home to the Lone Star State with a badly-needed victory and, perhaps more importantly, a healthy Romo. Depending on the outcome of Monday night’s game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Carolina Panthers, Dallas may enter their bye week in sole possession of first place in the NFC East.

Romo said: ‘You obviously want to have a chance to control your destiny and go out and do that. And we have that ability and guys have played hard and they put forth a lot of work and commitment to get to this point. And I'm proud that they have got themselves and ourselves in this position. But no one has won anything yet. It's all in front of you. You got to take it and move forward and get better.’

Four of Dallas’ six remaining games are against divisional opponents, so the Cowboys playoff chances are truly in their own hands.

According to Bryant, the team will ‘stay focused’ and ‘get better each and every day’. He said:

‘It's good. We got to continue to keep our head down and focus on our goal, and we all know what that is. We got to stay together, play together, and hope for the best.’

The Jaguars will remain in the cellar of the AFC South and once again be outside of the playoff picture looking in when postseason play begins in January.

The exuberant Bryant finished the day with six receptions, 158 yards and two touchdowns

Regardless of their failure to find success at Wembley in 2014, the Jags will return to the United Kingdom and play as the home team in Week 7 of the 2015 NFL season.

Although Dallas won’t be returning next year, franchise owner Jerry Jones would like to see the Cowboys back in London. 

He said: ‘I wouldn’t dare elaborate under when, what, how, but again, this is attractive to our franchise. This is attractive to me. I like the idea. I like for our players to have these experiences.’

The Cowboys will never give up a home game to play at Wembley, but Jones said the team would gladly travel to the UK on a yearly basis if a team is permanently placed in London.

‘On a personal basis and speaking for the Dallas Cowboys we very much would like to have a team in London,’ Jones said. ‘It has cache. It has an air about it of international competition I think that London is probably one of two or three cities outside of the United States that really does have all of the criteria that I would look at for having an NFL team.’

Given the fond memories the Cowboys created on Remembrance Sunday against the Jaguars, it’s not hard to see why Jones would want Dallas to return as soon as possible
