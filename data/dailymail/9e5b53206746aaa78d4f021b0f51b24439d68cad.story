At least 20 migrants are feared dead off the coast of Libya, in the latest boat tragedy to blight the Mediterranean.

The news follows a decision by the UK not to support the rescue of those at risk of drowning during crossings to Europe.

The Italian coast guard saved 93 would-be immigrants after their boat capsized but they said there were 113 on board in total.

Italy, the gateway for tens of thousands seeking a new life in Europe, has been running a major search and rescue operation called Mare Nostrum following a boat disaster off the island of Lampedusa last year in which more than 300 migrants drowned.

This year alone 150,000 migrants have arrived on Italian shores by boat while around 3,000 are estimated to have drowned making the crossing.

A joint EU rescue migrant rescue mission is due to start this weekend in the Mediterranean but will have just a third of the funding of the previous Italian mission and will only patrol close to shore.

The British government has refused to contribute saying that the rescues only encourage more people to attempt the crossing.

A Home Office spokesman said: 'Ministers across Europe have expressed concerns that search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean have acted as a pull factor for illegal migration, encouraging people to make dangerous crossings in the expectation of rescue.

'This has led to more deaths as traffickers have exploited the situation using boats that are unfit to make the crossing.'

Foreign Office minister Baroness Anelay said: 'The government believes the most effective way to prevent refugees and migrants attempting this dangerous crossing is to focus our attention on countries of origin and transit, as well as taking steps to fight the people smugglers who willfully put lives at risk by packing migrants into unseaworthy boats.'

The commander of the Italian fleet said Europe has 'a duty' to save lives.

Vice Admiral Filippo Foffi said: 'We have the duty in these cases when we are at sea, to intervene to save human life.

'If we are not at sea then we can't see what happens, we can close our eyes, turn off the lights.

'There's no need to "turn back" the boats because they will die.'

Labour leader Ed Miliband slammed the Government's decision to stop saving migrants fleeing Africa on boats

The decision was attacked by Labour leader Ed Miliband yesterday, who accused David Cameron of showing a lack of 'basic humanity' during Prime Minister's Questions.

Mr Miliband said: ‘On immigration his government combines callousness with incompetence. They don’t show basic humanity and say rescuing drowning people is a pull factor for immigration.

‘But they are so incompetent they can’t deliver their basic promises. Why doesn’t he just admit it, on immigration, he has failed?’

The Prime Minister rejected the criticism and accused Labour of leaving 'the biggest mess this country has ever seen' when it came to immigration. 

Ministers came under fire in the House of Commons today after confirming the decision that Britain will not provide help to immigrants who get into trouble in the Mediterranean.

Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said Britain was ready to give further help to EU border management agency Frontex's new Operation Triton in the Mediterranean, which will replace the Italian Mare Nostrum search and rescue mission.

But responding to the latest news of up to 20 deaths, shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper told MailOnline: ‘The Immigration Minister has today confirmed the awful lack of humanity behind the Government's call to end search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean.

‘Ministers claim that stopping the rescue operations will somehow deter people from travelling.

‘But as we have seen today how many more people do they think will die trying before that happens? 

'Letting some people drown in order to deter others from trying is inhumane and fails to understand the many reasons why people are prepared to take the risk of getting into these ricketty, overcrowded boats in the first place.

‘The idea that trafficking gangs or desperate refugees will be put off by Ministers planned publicity campaign in North Africa and the Middle East is utterly absurd - and a sham to hide the heartlessness of their approach.’
