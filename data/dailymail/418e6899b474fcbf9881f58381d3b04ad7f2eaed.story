There have been four World Cups in South America and each has been won by a South American team. That is about to change.

Not because a European country is  certain to claim the trophy in Brazil. The hosts and Argentina remain favourites, we know that.

Yet even if a South American team is victorious again, the majority of the players will take their medals back to homes in Europe.

This is not 1978, when just one of 
Argentina’s world champions, Mario Kempes, played outside Argentina. 
Kempes, who had been two seasons with Valencia before helping his nation
 triumph in Buenos Aires, was the first South American world champion 
not to be based in his own country.

At this tournament, it would be 
easier to list those that remain. Even Colombia have only three players 
in their Liga Postobon, and four who play in Argentina.

Brazil’s 
squad contains five players who did not even play what would amount to a
 full season in their domestic league before departing - including Hulk,
 whose career at home amounts to one game for Vitoria of Salvador in 
2004.

So when France and Germany meet tonight in the Maracana Stadium
 in Rio de Janeiro, it should be with no inferiority complex about what 
lies ahead.

Europe will be guaranteed at least one  representative in the semi-finals, perhaps as many as three. Indeed,
 the most eye-catching, emphatic  performances of the competition so far - Spain 1 Holland 5, Germany 4 Portugal 0, France 5  Switzerland 2 - 
have come from the Europeans, even if the outstanding individuals - 
Neymar, Lionel Messi, James Rodriguez, Luis Suarez - have been South 
American.

High five! Holland's emphatic victory over Spain was one of the outstanding matches of the World Cup so far

Times have changed. A trip to the southern hemisphere is no
 longer so daunting for players who travel in the Champions League on an
 almost weekly basis and regularly undertake pre-season or mid-season 
trips to distant continents.

In 1930, when the first World Cup was 
held in Uruguay, the four European participants, Belgium, France, 
Romania and Yugoslavia, all left on the same ship, along with the three 
European referees, FIFA president Jules Rimet and what was to become his
 trophy.

The hosts won, but it wasn’t a complete disaster for the 
European visitors. Yugoslavia beat Brazil and Bolivia, Romania defeated 
Peru and France got the better of Mexico. Only Belgium did not record a 
 victory over a continental rival.

In 1950, when the World Cup came 
to Brazil the last time, the prospect of travelling across the Atlantic 
was still so alien that Scotland, Turkey, Portugal and France qualified 
but chose not to compete. The group stage record of the European clubs 
against South and Central American opponents, then, is very creditable: 
they lost only two of 10 games, and won six.

Nothing to fear: France have impressed at this summer's tournament having breezed through the group stage

Team effort: Germany have been seen one of the tournament's favourites since before it started

In 1962, in Chile, six 
of the eight quarter-finalists were European, even if Brazil defeated 
Czechoslovakia in the final. So the idea that it is impossible for a 
European country to win on South American soil, while evidence-based to 
here, is not unreasonably challenged.

Certainly, the Germans, who 
have not failed to make it beyond the World Cup’s group stage since 
1938, looked very at home at their Rio de Janeiro hotel base on Thursday. A
 viral illness had affected a number of the squad, but those who were 
fit and able happily bathed in the sun by the swimming pool, signing 
autographs, posing for photographs and looking very relaxed.

Bastian
 Schweinsteiger went for a walk along the beachfront alone and returned 
surrounded by an excited mob. There were screams and squeals from 
supporters kept behind barriers every time a player made an appearance 
on his balcony. The player waved, the fans squealed some more, and some 
held up perfectly inscribed pieces of card, explaining why they needed 
a T-shirt signed.

Very ordered autograph hunters, the Germans. None
 of this chasing Mesut Ozil down the road shouting, ‘Oi mate’. They 
would have an  Arsenal replica shirt, with his name on the back, plus a 
legible, formal, written request clearly displayed and a black marker 
pen ready. It was almost as if, instinctively, they knew the drill. 
Being German, they probably did.

Settled: Germany have made themselves at home at their Rio De Janeiro base this summer

Considering the envy for this German team in England, there is a surprising swirl of dissent around 
Joachim Low and his selections. There is criticism of his back four, 
which amounts to a quartet of  centre-halves, and fury that this means 
he now plays Philipp Lahm in midfield, echoing his new role under Pep 
Guardiola at Bayern Munich.

Further negative Catalan influence is seen 
in Low’s preference for a false nine, with the squad’s only striker, 
Miroslav Klose, on the bench. Fine when putting four past Portugal, less
 so when taken to extra time by Algeria.

Certainly, Lahm will have 
his work cut out on Friday night, up against arguably the most powerful central 
midfielder in the competition, Paul Pogba of France. Comparisons with 
Patrick Vieira now seem very apposite, although in time the Arsenal man 
thinks they will come to flatter him. He feels Pogba is more capable of 
changing games going forward, and is probably right.

Even so, 
Germany remain narrow favourites.

‘We have big ambitions, more than ever
 now we are in the last eight,’ said Chelsea’s Andre Schurrle.

‘When you
 come to a World Cup with Germany, you are expected to win it.’ Ozil was
 in agreement.

‘We would be legends as the first European team to win in
 South America,’ he added. 'We can beat anyone on our day.’

IIt will 
be hot at the Maracana, 30 degrees, but there was a heatwave in Germany 
in the 2006 World Cup, too. Certainly the climate hasn’t been the killer
 of European ambitions that many suspected. Manaus was difficult, but 
when England played Uruguay in Sao Paulo, for instance, the temperature 
was more conducive to a European team than a South American one.

Germany
 think the debilitating bug may have been caused by a  sudden drop in 
temperature in  miserable Porto Alegre, having got used to the sunshine 
of Recife. Given the vast travelling distances involved, jetlag seems 
more of an issue than sunstroke right now. 

How great a part will be
 played by continental allegiance, though, remains to be seen. Does the 
fact that Brazil and Argentina have almost as many players who are based
 in Europe - 18 and 19 respectively - as either Germany, France, Holland
 or Belgium mean South America’s advantage on their own continent is at 
an end?

The locals even have a name for the Brazilians who play 
abroad - estrangeiros, they call them.  Foreigners. Of the four still 
based in Brazil, two are the reserve  goalkeepers, Jefferson and Victor.
 The first-choice goalkeeper, Julio Cesar, now plays for Toronto.

Maybe
 that is why the Brazilian national anthem is sung with such passion and
 conviction by the team, some with tears running down  their cheeks. 
Exiles are often the  ones who most crave emotional  connection with the
 homeland. Low, Germany’s coach, even believes this is a potent force 
that makes the South Americans harder to beat.

‘They are all at home 
here, but it is not just about that,’ he said. ‘The South Americans, 
even the Central Americans, want to show their class on their home 
continent. They want to show the world “This is where we come from”. 
They will do whatever is necessary to satisfy the fans and the nation.

They are strong teams anyway, so with that, it is no  surprise to me 
that they play well. You can feel that emotion.’

For a while, though,
 the Maracana Stadium will echo to old world rivalries tomorrow, but 
estrangeiros await the winner in the semi-final. That will decide what 
matters in Brazil: where you’re from, or where you’re at.
