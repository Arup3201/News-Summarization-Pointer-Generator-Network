The Archbishop of Canterbury says vicars should avoid preaching 'moral claptrap' about being nice in their sermons adding Christianity's message is as radical as a call for violent revolution.

Speaking at an event in New York City, where he delivered a homily, the Most Reverend Justin Welby called on people to 'get their hands dirty' if they are to tackle inequality in society.

He said that the old sermons he often heard while growing up England, all urged people to be nice, but he explained that Jesus wouldn't allow his followers to accept this given that the 'weak' are often excluded from society.

The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, who says vicars should avoid preaching 'moral claptrap' about being nice as Christianity's message is as radical as a call for 'violent revolution' 

Mr Welby also explained that the message of Christianity could be mistaken for a call to 'violent revolution' if it wasn't for the religion's emphasis on peace. 

He was visiting New York to speak at the 'Creating Common Good' conference organised by the Trinity Institute at Trinity Church on the city's Wall Street in the heart of the financial district.

In a speech, published online by Lambeth Palace, he told the congregation: 'Jesus does not permit us to accept a society in which the weak are excluded, whether because of race, wealth, gender, ability, or sexuality.

'Nor did He permit us and does He permit us to turn religion into morality.

'The old sermons that we have heard so often in England, which I grew up with, which if you boiled them down all they effectively said was: “Wouldn't the world be a nicer place if we were all a bit nicer?” 

'That is the kind of moral claptrap that Jesus does not permit us to accept.'

Mr Welby was speaking at an event at the Trinity Church on Wall Street, New York City, pictured, which was focusing on inequality in society 

He then said that the church has mistaken the way in which they should challenge such inequality saying it began to turn into an 'exclusive little tribe.'

The Archbishop then explained that if weren't for Jesus being described as the 'Prince of Peace', Christianity would almost be a call to a 'violent revolution'.

He added: 'We are, by contrast, as Christians to be caught up in a revolution of expectation and of implementation.

'Were it not for the fact that He is in title Prince of Peace, and lived out his mission in service and foot-washing, ending it in crucifixion and resurrection, this would be a call to violent revolution.'

He also spoke of his experiences of living in Liverpool, where he was Dean of the city's cathedral for four years.

He told of how the former Bishop of Liverpool, David Sheppard worked together with his Roman Catholic counterpart Derek Worlock to tackle appalling poverty in the city.

The Archbishop's latest comments come after he has been repeatedly outspoken about deprivation in UK cities and how the gap between the rich and the poor is becoming wider since taking up the post in 2012.

Just last week, Mr Welby, a former oil trader, spoke out about pay inequality telling all employers they should pay the living wage. 

He said that most businesses can afford to pay the living wage - which is at least £1.35 an hour more than the minimum wage, saying firms should: 'Just get on with it.'

He added: 'It can be done, it should be done.'

Meanwhile last year the Archbishop appeared to be on course to clash with Prime Minister David Cameron after calling on him to reverse his decision not to take European funds to boost UK food banks.

Talking about his experiences of visiting Congo, where he saw starving children, and then returning to the UK to see a similar situation involving a young family, he said: 'I was talking to some people - a mum, dad and one child - in a food bank.

'I found their plight more shocking. It was less serious, but it was here. And they weren't careless with what they had - they were just up against it.

'It shocked me that being up against it at the wrong time brought them to this stage. There are many like them. But we can do something about it.' 

In 2013, he also warned against dismissing all people on benefits as scroungers and challenged government claims that people were using food banks simply because they were there.

He said it was important that ministers do not use ‘derogatory language’ to describe people who are poor.
