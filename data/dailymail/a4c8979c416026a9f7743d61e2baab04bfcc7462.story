Death row: Kelly Renee Gissendaner (above), 47,  is scheduled to be executed at 7pm on Wednesday

A woman who is will become Georgia's first female inmate to be executed in 70 years when she is given the lethal injection tomorrow is making a final plea for her life this morning.

Kelly Renee Gissendaner, the only woman on death row in the state, is scheduled to die at 7pm on Wednesday at a Jackson prison for the 1997 death of her husband in suburban Atlanta.

The 47-year-old has exhausted all appeals to higher courts but on Tuesday morning, she will ask the parole board - the sole authority who can commute a death sentence - for clemency.

'The Board will either grant clemency, commuting to life with or without parole possibility, deny clemency, or issue a stay not to exceed 90 days,' board spokesman Steven Hayes told the Athens-Banner Herald on Monday.

The board will meet in private at 9am. They could reach a decision on Tuesday but the only guideline is that they must decide the outcome before her scheduled execution time.

Gissendaner was convicted of killing her husband, Douglas, in February 1997 along with her then-boyfriend Gregory Owen.

Authorities said she had wanted to kill her husband - whom she had previously divorced and then re-married - because she wanted to split from him again but thought he would not leave her alone.

Together, the duo plotted the murder for months and Owen followed her orders to kill Douglas while she was out at a nightclub with friends on February 7, 1997, CNN reported.

Owen waited at the couple's home until Douglas arrived before kidnapping him and driving him to a remote area. He stole his watch and wallet to make the murder look like a robbery. 

Arrest: Gissendaner, who is Georgia's only female death row inmate, was arrested in 1997 for plotting to kill her husband with her then-boyfriend, Gregory Owen (right), who ultimately testified against her

Victim: Douglas Gissendaner was stabbed multiple times in the neck by Owen in February 1997 after his wife wanted to divorce him but thought he would not leave her alone. His body was found two weeks later

He then beat Douglas across the head with a nightstick and stabbed him in the neck and back between eight and 10 times. 

Kelly Gissendaner arrived as the murder took place but remained in her car. She later got out to make sure that her husband was dead before the pair took Douglas' vehicle and burned it using kerosene.

The duo then left the scene.

Douglas' burned-out car was found the following morning, and more than a week later the body was found a mile away. Animals had eaten away at the skin on Douglas' neck, making it hard for authorities to deduce which stab wound had killed him, CNN reported.

In the days before he was found, Kelly Gissendaner had appeared on local TV to appeal for help finding her husband - but on February 24, Owen confessed to the murder and implicated her.

While in jail, she plotted to pay someone $10,000 to falsely claim that they had driven her to the murder scene at gunpoint, but her cellmate alerted authorities to the plan.

Owen is serving life in prison in Washington state for his role in the murder. He avoided the death penalty after testifying against his former lover.

Locked up: Gissendaner, who will be the first woman to be executed in Georgia in 70 years, is seen eating a meal in her cell at Metro State Prison in Atlanta in 2004. She has requested a 2,400-calorie final meal

She was sentenced to death in November 1998 after she was found guilty of her part in the death.

Gissendaner, who is incarcerated at Arrendale State Prison, is the only woman among 84 inmates facing the death penalty in Georgia, according to a report by the state's Department of Corrections.

She is set to be only the 14th woman executed in Georgia since 1735, according to the AJC.

The last time a woman was executed was in 1945. Lena Baker was electrocuted in March of that year after she was convicted of murder for shooting her boss.

In 2005, the state pardoned her after agreeing with her family that she acted in self defense.

Gissendaner has requested a last meal of cornbread with a side of buttermilk; two Burger King Whoppers with cheese; two large orders of fries; cherry vanilla ice cream; popcorn; a salad with boiled eggs, tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, carrots, cheese and Newman's Own buttermilk dressing; and lemonade, according to CBS46.

A rough estimate shows that the food contains more than 4,200 calories. 

Under Georgia law, only three offenses are punishable by death - murder, rape and kidnapping.
