A mysterious explosion that rocked Nicaragua on Saturday night, creating a 39ft-wide (12 metre) crater, appears to have been caused by a small meteorite.

And authorities in the region believe the meteorite was in fact a shard of rock from the 2014 RC ‘pitbull’ asteroid that soared past Earth over the weekend. 

The impact, close to the country’s international airport, did not cause any known injuries, but the hit was powerful enough to be felt throughout the capital, according to reports.

The explosion hit woodland in Managua in Nicaragua on Saturday and created a crater measuring 39 feet (12 metres) wide (pictured). Authorities in the region believe it was a shard of rock from the 2014 RC ‘pitbull’ asteroid that soared past Earth at a similar time to the impact

Tests are now being carried out on the crater to learn more about how it was formed.

‘We are convinced that this was a meteorite. We have seen the crater from the impact,’ said Wilfredo Strauss of the Seismic Institute.

Nasa estimates the 2014 RC asteroid to be approximately 65ft (20 metres) wide - roughly the same size as a large house.

This makes it similar in size to the Chelyabinsk meteorite that exploded over Russia’s Ural Mountains region in February 2013.

At the time of closest approach, asteroid 2014 RC was said to be one-tenth the distance from the centre of Earth to the moon - or about 25,000 miles (40,000km).

The asteroid was reported as passing closest to earth at approximately 7.18pm BST (2.18pm EST), as it travelled over New Zealand.

It did not hit Earth, but its orbit will bring it back to our planet's neighbourhood in the future.

The asteroid's future motion will be closely monitored, but no future threatening Earth encounters have been identified, according to Nasa. 

The Nicaraguan authorities continued that the timing of the impact fits closely with the passing of the ['pitbull'] asteroid, which passed very close to Earth on Sunday.

A meteorite was also spotted flying over Spain on Sunday evening, and astrophysicists are trying to determine if the two events are related.

Before the event, Nasa estimated the asteroid to be approximately 65ft (20 metres) wide - roughly the same size as a house.

The meteorite, which may have splintered from the asteroid, is said to have hurtled into a wooded area near the airport around midnight, and the hit was so large that it registered on the instruments Strauss's organisation uses to measure earthquakes.

This is the incredible moment an asteroid the size of a house skimmed past the Earth. The rock, known as 2014 RC or Pitbull, made the unexpected close approach during the early hours of September 8

The meteorite appeared to have hurtled into a wooded area near the airport in the Nicaraguan capital (pictured) at around midnight on Saturday. The hit was so large, experts at the Seismic Institute said it registered on the instruments used to measure earthquakes

‘You can see two waves: first, a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth, and then another stronger one, which is the impact of the sound,’ Mr Strauss continued.

Government officials and experts visited the impact site on Sunday.

One of them, William Martinez, said it was not yet clear if the meteorite burned up completely or if it had been blasted into the soil.

‘You can see mirror-like spots on the sides of the crater from where the meteorite power-scraped the walls,’ Martinez said.

2014 RC zipped passed a cluster of television and weather satellites around 22,000 miles from the Earth's surface at around 8pm UK time. Nasa scientists said it would be difficult to spot the asteroid without using a telescope and that it is likely to be even closer to the moon

The whale-sized asteroid had a ‘very close’ shave with Earth 
on Sunday. This image shows the orbit of asteroid 
2014 RC around the sun. The asteroid is about 60ft (20 metres) across in size

Dr Dan Brown, an astronomy expert at Nottingham Trent University, told MailOnline: 'The possible meteorite impact in Nicaragua, linked with the asteroid 2014 RC which flew by Earth last night, raises some interesting questions.

'Although the impact occurred roughly 12 hours before the asteroid passed Earth, that part of the planet was facing in the right direction for it to have been a fragment associated with it.

'If it was an unrelated object, however, then it further demonstrates how we don’t really monitor all the potentially dangerous rocks out there.'

Government spokeswoman, First Lady Rosario Murillo, said Managua would be in contact with the US Geological Service to try to get more information about ‘this fascinating event’ in the Central American nation, one of Latin America's poorest countries.

People who live near the crater told local media they heard a blast they took for an explosion, and that liquid, sand and dust were blown through the air, which smelled like something had burned.

There were no reported injuries because the impact was in a wooded spot, and flights at the airport were not affected.

The
 date of Earth's potential destruction has been set at 16 March 2880, 
when an asteroid hurtling through space has a possibility of striking 
our planet.

Researchers
 studying the rock found that its body rotates so quickly that it should
 break apart, but somehow remains intact on its Earth-bound trajectory.

They
 believe it is held together by cohesive forces known as van der Waals -
 and although this is considered a major breakthrough, scientists still 
don't know how to stop it.

The
 discovery was made by researchers at the University of Tennessee (UT), 
Knoxville. Previous research has shown that asteroids are loose piles of
 rubble held together by gravity and friction.

The
 asteroid is travelling at about 9 miles (15km) a second relative to the
 Earth. It is due to swing so close to Earth it could slam into the 
Atlantic Ocean at 38,000 miles per hour.

It
 is estimated that if 1950 DA were to collide with the planet, it would 
do so with a force of around 44,800 megatonnes of TNT. Although the 
probability of an impact is only 0.3 per cent, this represents a risk 50
 per cent greater than an impact from all other asteroids.

The Spanish meteorite was spotted above Barcelona on Sunday evening, and was monitored by the Spanish Meteorological Agency (Aemet).

Its fireball was spotted by thousands of people, who uploaded images of the rock to social networks.

Spanish
 astrophysicist, Jose Maria Trigo, said: 'We think the meteorite may 
have flown over more areas of the country including Aragon, however, 
because it was pretty cloudy there we believe it may have been widely 
missed, and was only spotted when it emerged over a clear area that 
included Barcelona.'

The team is now studying footage and adding it to scientific data its machines gathered to try and work out what it was, where it entered the atmosphere, and where it ended up.

Trigo added: 'Calibration requires weeks of research when there is an absence of stars in the images. But nevertheless, it has been made easier thanks to all the social media video footage and pictures.'

Local emergency services also received several calls about the meteorite from panicked people wondering if it might be a plane or a UFO on fire.

It is believed that the suspected meteorite crashed in a remote location. Trigo added that, given the size of the fireball, the suspected meteorite was almost certainly too large to have burnt up and therefore would have impacted somewhere – adding: 'The question now is to find out where.'
