Murdered: Sida Osman was beaten to death with a bowling ball by a 13-year-old boy in June - who was sentenced to 23-years in jail today in Fort Worth, Texas

A Texas teenager who battered a 5-year-old to death with a bowling ball 'like a football player spiking a football' has been sentenced to 23-years behind bars today.

Sida Osman was horrifically beaten round the head by the unidentified teen - who was 13 at the time of the attack in June - after going for a bike ride and running into the older boy.

Angry at the younger boys constant pleas to help him go to the store, the teen picked up a 14-pound bowling ball and threw it at Sida's head, knocking him to the ground, then straddled him and pounded the ball onto the 5-year-old's head till he crushed his skull.

Eighteen hours after the murder, which occurred in the backyard of a vacant house in Fort Worth, the teen went to get three friends and showed them the younger boys dead body.

Shocked, they demanded he call an ambulance, but the teenager stopped them and then in a callous act he denied knowing where Sida was when the boy's frantic mother asked him later on the street if he had seen her missing boy.

Sobs were heard in the Fort Worth juvenile court as the teen pleaded guilty to the capital murder of his neighbor and accepted a plea deal of 23-years behind bars.

The teen, who is now 14, turned to the distraught family of Sida and said, 'I just want the family to know I'm sorry.'

'There were tears all over that courtroom,' said Assistant District Attorney Riley Shaw, who handled the case along with prosecutor Brock Groom. 'They were real tears form real people. This is a horrific, horrific case.'

The defendant will remain in the juvenile justice system until he's 19, at which time he'll likely be transferred to the adult prison system according to the Fort Worth Star Telegram.

The teens defense attorney Ray Hall Jr. characterized the boy as one suffering from mental illness growing up without a father who is currently in prison.

Indeed, they said that his mother tried many times to get him medical help and had him admitted to a mental health facility many times.

'They keep him a week and then let him back out,' Hall said to the Fort Worth Star Telegram.

'She feels like sheâ€™s made an effort to get him help but it kind of falls on deaf ears.'

Distressing testimony heard in court revealed how the teen beat the little boy until he stopped convulsing on the ground and 'because Sida kept bothering and pestering him to go to the store.'

Sida Osman's mother, whose family moved to North Texas to escape violence in Somalia, spoke through a translator when she took the witness stand.

'A part of our family is missing,' she said through tears. 'We miss him every day. Why did he kill him? He's only 5 years old.'
