A young mother killed her baby by slitting his throat only 30 minutes after giving birth because she feared the child would interfere with her sex life, a court heard.

Nadine Koenig, 20, from Regensburg in the German state of Bavaria, smothered her newborn son before killing him with a Stanley knife. Then she went out to a disco, judges were told.

Prosecutor Ulrike Klein said the child was a responsibility she could not handle. ‘You couldn’t bear the thought of your far-reaching sexual and social contacts being jeopardised by this baby,’ she added.

Koenig, who had concealed her pregnancy from her parents, gave birth at their home in February last year, the court in Regensburg heard.

Later she dumped her son’s body near the Danube. After Koenig’s arrest, her mother Kerstin, 44, committed suicide. Koenig is accused of murder.
