Furious Iain Duncan Smith threatened a
Treasury official he would ‘bite your balls off’ in an extraordinary 
row over attempts to block his flagship welfare reforms.

The Work and Pensions Secretary tore 
into the mandarin after repeated attempts by George Osborne’s ministry 
to block his huge shake-up of the benefits system.

The revelations lift the lid on the 
tensions between the Treasury and the Department for Work and Pensions 
over the multi-billion pound creation of the Universal Credit, combining
eight benefits into one.

Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith reportedly lost his temper when he heard one of his officials having a phone row with the Treasury

After months of attempts to block the 
reforms, Mr Duncan Smith lost his temper when he heard a member of his 
team rowing on the phone with a Treasury official, The Times reported.

He grabbed the receiver and shouted 
down the line: ‘If you ever speak to my officials like that again I’ll 
bite your balls off and send them to you in a box.’

The newspaper also claimed Mr Duncan 
Smith cancelled the security pass of a Downing Street official to stop 
them entering his department.

Sources suggested Mr Duncan Smith did not use the word 'bite' but aides refused to comment on the reports of the call which is thought to have happened in 2010.

Universal Credit combines Jobseeker's 
Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, Income Support, Working Tax
Credit, Child Tax Credit, and Housing Benefit.

If someone on the new benefit gets work, it will be gradually withdrawn as their income rises.

The first pilot, in Ashton-under-Lyme,
began yesterday for single, childless people who are out of work and 
will be rolled out nationally from October.

Mr Duncan Smith has vowed to back up officials at his Department for Work and Pensions to ensure his Universal Credit reforms are a success

Ministers believe the system will make
it much easier for people to see that they would be better off in 
employment. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith hailed the new
system as ‘nothing less than the start of a fundamental cultural shift 
of the welfare system’.

He dismissed Labour claims that the 
system was suffering from delays, insisting it would be rolled out in 
full by 2017 as planned.

But the tiny scale of the pilot scheme
suggests ministers have been warned the system is likely to suffer 
numerous teething problems before it is extended to handle millions of 
benefits claims.

The Treasury has repeatedly raised concerns about the scale and pace of the change.

One source said: ‘The Treasury hoped 
to kill it off by delaying. It took seven months to make decisions that 
should have taken a week. That tactic has always worked for them in the 
past; but it hasn’t worked this time because we refused to accept it.’

But Mr Duncan Smith insists the changes will save billions of pounds over time.

He said: ‘It's about saving money through work, and getting people out of poverty through work.

‘We haven’t made a direct estimate but
it will save billions in my view, billions in overpayments which we 
won’t have to make and fraud, it will be a much tighter system and it 
will improve people by getting them back to work.

‘This programme I believe will change 
the way we deliver welfare in this country …for too long we have paid 
far too much money to people who sat there on benefits.

‘It’s a big, big change. It’s a big 
positive change and it saves money by getting people back to work and 
making them tax payers, and Britain again will really grow, and be 
really a strong nation.’

Many of the reforms were drawn up by 
the Centre for Social Justice, the think tank Mr Duncan Smith set up 
after being ousted as Tory leader.
