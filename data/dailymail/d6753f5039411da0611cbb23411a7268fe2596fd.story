Three teenagers who died in a horror car crash had gone out to celebrate passing their driving test at the time of the smash, it has emerged.

Rhys Hunter survived the crash, which killed three of his friends as well as a pensioner, and is now recovering in hospital - but relatives say he is 'lucky to be alive'.

The driver Rhodri Miller had passed his test just three days before the crash on Friday, which happened when he lost control of the car while going around the bend of a winding mountain road in Brecon, South Wales.

In statements issued via police, relatives of the three teenagers said they were struggling to come to terms with their loss.

Rhodri's parents described their son, a season ticket holder at Cardiff City FC, as 'a bright, talented' A-level student 'who had so much to live for'.

Alesha's mother and father, Sharon and Paul, said: 'She was the perfect daughter and friend and has left a massive void in our family. 

'Alesha was beautiful, intelligent and artistic and had her whole life ahead of her. We as a family would like to pass on our sympathy to the other families who have lost loved ones.'

Corey's famiy added: 'The family of Corey Price are devastated by the sudden and tragic loss of their wonderful gentle and caring son, brother, uncle and grandson.

'No words can explain how we are feeling but we are truly grateful of the support of our family and friends at this tragic time.'

Scene: Police have arrested seven people on suspicion of dangerous driving in connection with the smash

Tragic: Alesha, who attended St Richard Gwyn Roman Catholic High School in Barry,  was rushed to hospital but died of her injuries  on Saturday

Seven teenage boys who were travelling in other cars have been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving in connection with the crash.

Headmaster Dylan Jones said the local community had been left devastated by the tragedy.

He said: 'It's been a shock to us all, and a number of their friends also are feeling the shock.'

Moving messages were left outside the school, including on written on a shirt which read: 'God has gained three more angels. Sleep tight guys. We'll miss you... gone but never forgotten.'

Another written on a bunch of flowers read: 'In loving memory of Rhodri, Corey, and Alesha - who were so greatly admired. Your futures were so bright.'

Police believe the victim's green Volkswagen was 'travelling in convoy' with a number of vehicles at the time, with Rhodri behind the wheel days after he passed his driving test.

The car collided with a black VW, carrying Mrs Challis, whose driver was seriously injured.

Superintendent Chris Curtis, of Dyfed Powys Police, said: 'This is a tragic incident and our thoughts are with the families at this difficult time.

'We are working with South Wales Police in order to provide support to the families affected and also the communities they live within. We will work with partners to ensure that the incident is fully investigated.'
