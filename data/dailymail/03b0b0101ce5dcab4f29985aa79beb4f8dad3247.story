On trial: Jason Smith was charged with strangling 35-year-old Dr Melissa Ketunuti, who was found bound and burned in her home

A Philadelphia pediatrician pleaded for her life as she was strangled by an exterminator working in her home this year, police have revealed.

The confession by 37-year-old suspect Jason Smith was read by police on Wednesday in court.

Police said that Smith cried and apologized as he admitted to choking Dr Melissa Ketunuti to death, tying her up and burning her corpse.

A judge then ordered Smith held for trial on charges including murder and arson in the death of Dr Ketunuti, 35.

Smith was dealing with a mouse infestation in the doctor's home at the time, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

According to Smith's statement, he attacked Dr Ketunuti in the basement of her downtown home on January 21 after she criticized his work.

The statement says Smith strangled her, tied her and up and set a fire to destroy evidence.

Surveillance video from nearby businesses helped lead to Smith's arrest a few days later at his Levittown home.

Smith's lawyer did not immediately return a request for comment.

Dr Ketunuti was a researcher at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

The brutal and grisly death of the young pediatrician stunned the neighborhood, Smith's family and even police - who are baffled as to why he would commit such a crime with no violent past.

When he confessed to police, he allegedly told them Ketunuti belittled him, which made him so angry that he struck her.

Murdered: Dr Melissa Ketunuti had been a pediatrician for five years before her gruesome murder in Philadelphia in January

CCTV: Melissa Ketunuti is seen just before 11am returning to her home after running some errands in the area on January 21

Stalker: Less than one minute later, Smith follows in her footsteps, wearing a North Face jacket and hat

After: Less than an hour later, the camera showed Smith leaving the scene of the murder with his coat and hat removed

Victim: Dr Ketunuti, who worked at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, was only 35 when she was tied up, strangled and set on fire

After
 an intense investigation, police were able to zero in on Smith after a
 local coffee shop owner and police officers pored over the CCTV footage
 from the day of the murder and saw the young doctor walk by with Smith 
following closely behind.

An
 hour later, he returns, this time with a clearer image of his face, 
gets into his pickup truck and drives away before circling the doctor's 
home twice.

He then went on to another job in New Jersey. A police source said that Smith was working on behalf of a company called David Bilyk Exterminating.

Developer Ori Feibush, who owns the OCF Coffee House, at 18th and South 
streets, which is around the corner from Ketunuti's house, told Philly.com: 'We had crystal-clear video of him [Smith] walking right past the coffee
 shop and looking at the cameras.

'I was exceptionally 
uncomfortable until they caught the guy because it looked like anybody 
who walks by the shop.'

Leaving: Jason Smith's silver pickup truck is seen driving away before circling the area a few times. The truck was seized as crucial evidence

Remains: Police officers carry the charred body of Melissa Ketunuti from her home to a waiting police van

Mr Feibush added: 'When he came back he had gloves on, his hat was off and his jacket was 
in his arms,' he said. 'Coming back he walks directly under the camera 
and that's when we realized, "Wow!" We had this guy on camera.'

He
 said he went outside to get homicide detectives who were still 
stationed to the area on Wednesday and told them what he found.

'They were in absolute shock as well,' he said. 'There was the guy, 
walking in broad daylight with no hat on, not hiding his appearance in 
front of a very powerful surveillance camera.'

Dr Ketunuti, 35, lived alone with her dog in the quiet, residential area of 
Philadelphia. Firefighters responded to the call around 12.30pm and 
discovered the bound body in her basement.

Authorities say she was fully clothed and there were no signs of sexual assault.

The doctor worked at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and was an avid blogger. She was a second-year infectious diseases fellow and researcher at CHOP.

'Melissa
 was a warm, caring, earnest, bright young woman with her whole future 
ahead of her,' said Paul Offit, MD, chief of the Division of Infectious 
Diseases, in a written statement.

'But
 more than that, she was admired, respected and loved by those with whom
 she worked here at CHOP. Her death will have a profound impact on those
 who worked with her and we will all miss her deeply.'

Her blog revealed she was an avid 
traveler - her mother is Belgian and her father Thai - and liked to go 
hiking and running in her free time.

According
 to the Philadelphia Inquirer, she earned a doctorate in medicine from 
Stanford University and had initially considered working as a surgeon 
internationally.

In the summer of 2005, she worked on an AIDS research fellowship in Botswana through the National Institutes of Health.

She also completed internships at Johns Hopkins Hospital and New York University.
