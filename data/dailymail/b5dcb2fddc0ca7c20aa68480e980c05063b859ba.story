A Nashville Predators superfan known for decorating his sizable tummy during games found a unique way to pop the question to his girlfriend. 

Ben Butzbach, of Nashville, Tennessee, who is better known to hockey fans as Big Ben, asked his girlfriend Brandy to marry him the best way he knew how - by painting 'Brandy will you marry me?' on his stomach.

And after being asked, on the jumbotron no less for all to see, Brandy said 'yes.' 

Nashville Predators superfan Big Ben proposed to his girlfriend by writing a message on his stomach

Big Ben aka Ben Butzbach has become famous for decorating his stomach during hockey games

Making the whole thing even more romantic was the fact that Big Ben popped the question on Valentine's Day.

'She said YES!' wrote Big Ben on his Instagram shortly after, sharing a picture of his belly and the ring.  

On Penalty Box Radio, where Big Ben is a contributor, he describes himself as a 'proud father' and, it should go without saying, a 'humongously big Predators fan.'

He is also 'a Leo, enjoys long walks on the beach, The Notebook, and cool nights by the fire listening to Lionel Richie.'

The bio will have to get edited a bit however, as Big Ben also claims to be 'single.'
