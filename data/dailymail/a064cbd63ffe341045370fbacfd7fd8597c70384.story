The father of a Canadian girl who committed suicide after she was gang-raped and then viciously cyber-bullied has received death threats warning that if he doesn't 'shut up' he'll 'join his daughter.'

Since Rehtaeh Parsons, 17, killed herself in April, her father, Glen Canning, has been a vocal advocate against cyberbullying and has demanded justice in the horrific case, in which two teens are facing porn-related charges.

But he said he has now received a sinister message posted on his YouTube account demanding he 'shut up' or his life may be at risk. He has alerted police and they have launched an investigation.

Death threats: Since Rehtaeh Parsons, 17, killed herself in April, her father, Glen Canning, pictured, has been a vocal advocate against cyberbullying and has demanded justice in her case. He has now received a death threat

'"I know where you live, I know your face, I know your car, I know your house, I know where you work. And you better shut up, bud, or you're going to be joining your daughter." Just stuff like that,' Canning told CBC News of the threats. 'It's pretty sad, actually.'

He added that he felt threatened enough to call the Canadian police.

'I would say I don't trust them why would I they are capable of doing some pretty sick stuff so whether or not they decide to take a shot at me some day I don't know,' he said.

Royal Canadian Mountain Police Sergeant Andy Kerr confirmed they had received a complaint from Canning but wouldn't comment further because the investigation is ongoing.

Police can request YouTube provide them with the person's information such as the IP address of the computer from where the comment originated.

In the meantime, Canning said he is taking precautions including setting up security cameras around his Novia Scotia home.

'Victim': Parsons, pictured, was labelled a 'slut' after she was allegedly gang raped by four teenagers in 2010

Protection: The two teenage suspects, now 18, cannot be identified under Canadian law because they were 16 when the alleged crime took place

'We have cameras set up around our home right now to keep track of things,' he said. 'But
I think that they're gutless cowards. They're the kind of people that 
would show up in the middle of the night and spray paint your house.'

The threats come just a week after the lawyer for one of the two 18-year-olds charged with circulating rape pictures of Parsons is also being persecuted by a 'cyber-lynch mob.'

Parsons'
tragic suicide brought international attention to her claims that she 
was gang-raped when she was 15 and then relentlessly tormented by 
classmates who called her a 'slut' and harassed her for sex.

Much
of the bullying was a result of a photo the circulated at her school 
that showed Parsons being assaulted by a teen boy while throwing up out a
window.

The two 
18-year-olds are charged with child pornography. One is accused of 
taking the picture, both are accused of circulating it. Because the 
alleged crime took place when the men were 16, they are charged as 
juveniles and their identities cannot be revealed.

Left behind: Her father said she killed herself out of disappointment in her
school, her former friends and law enforcement officers who failed to 
help her

They were both in court on August 15 with their parents for a brief appearance. The judge set a trial for September 19. 

Josh Arnold, the attorney for one of the men, told CTV News that his client has already been convicted in the court of public opinion.

'The
Internet mavens and some members of the media have acted like a lynch 
mob in relation to this matter. They've tried and convicted this person 
without any due process whatsoever,' he said.

Rehtaeh's
heartbroken parents say that she hanged herself in their bathroom two 
years after the alleged attack because she could not bear to bullying 
and torment at school.

Her uncle was furious about the attorney's allegations.

'This
man's saying that these boys have been prosecuted in the media.That 
hasn't been the case. That's not true,' Michael Parsons said.

'This
case has been brought forward in the media. Because, it was only 
through the media participation that this case is even being looked at 
today.'

He also said he is praying for the two accused.

Protesters: A handful of protestors turned out to the courthouse where the suspects in the Rehtaeh case were due to appear on August 15

'I have to pray for these boys. I 
have to pray for them to become good men. That's the hardest thing for 
me to do. But it's something I have to do. That's what's hard. If you 
want to know the truth that's the hardest thing to do,' he told the CBC.

'I
have absolutely no faith in the RCMP or the Halifax city police or the 
Crown prosecutors because they totally dropped this case, they totally 
dropped the ball.'

Rehtaeh's
death led to an outcry because no one was charged or even reprimanded 
at the school - either for her rape or for the bullying.

Four boys, aged 14, 17 and two aged 
16, allegedly took it in turns to sexually assault her on November 12, 2011, after plying her with 
alcohol, she told her mother days after.

Her
mother said she saw an image of the alleged attack which showed her 
daughter being raped by a teenage boy as he gave a 'thumbs up' sign while she vomited out of a window.

Police initially concluded there were no grounds to charge anyone after a year-long investigation.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police Corporal Scott MacRae said they arrested two 
males.

Innocence: Rehtaeh is pictured as a baby with her parents, Leah Parsons and Glen Canning

'Due to the sensitive nature around this investigation, the 
investigators do want to ensure that no court process is affected,' 
MacRae said.

The arrests came after someone came 
forward in April and provided new information and said they were willing
to verify who the suspects are.

'We're just hopeful there's charges laid and others to arrest, hoping 
that they're finally willing to tell their side of the story,' Leah 
Parsons, Rehtaeh's mother, said.

'A sense of relief came over me that at least they're going to be questioned.'

Last month Leah and her husband spoke to People magazine about their daughter's tragic death. 

'When Rehtaeh was born, I promised her the world. Now my beautiful girl is gone,' Leah said.

She started smoking pot to 'numb her emotions' and deal with Facebook messages and texts that came through by the dozen.

They read things like: 'Sluts are not welcome here' and 'everyone knew exactly what you have done'.

'No help': Cole Harbour High School staff failed to speak to the boys involved and Rehtaeh left

Rehtaeh
eventually closed down her Facebook page because there were so many men
asking her to have sex with them. They would say: ‘You had sex with my 
friend, so why not me?’

The
response from the school was, apparently, to do very little. Halifax 
school board spokesman Doug Hadley has said that none of the boys were 
spoken to.

Her father, Glen Canning, told People earlier: 'My 
daughter wasn't bullied to death, she was disappointed to death. 
Disappointed in people she thought she could trust, her school, and the 
police.'

Rehtaeh's death prompted the Nova Scotia government to launch reviews of
the RCMP's original investigation and the school board's handling of 
the matter.

An 
independent review released in June concluded the Halifax Regional 
School Board could have done a better job, but it was hindered by the 
fact that Rehtaeh was often absent from class.
