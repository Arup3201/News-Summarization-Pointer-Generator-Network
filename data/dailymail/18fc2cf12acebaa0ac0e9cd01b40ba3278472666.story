Two of Britain's top teenage sailors crashed into each other during a late-night journey, leaving a schoolgirl who was travelling with them brain-damaged, a court heard today.

Nia Jones and Elleni Morus, who have both represented Great Britain, were in charge of a group of 24 girls aged between 10 and 14 when they themselves were aged 17.  

Their two boats collided in darkness when they were returning to their hostel after a day's sailing on Cardiff Bay during a half-term residential course.  

Four young passengers were thrown from the boats, and one suffered severe brain injuries, Cardiff Crown Court was told.  

Trial: Elleni Morus, left, and Nia Jones, right, are accused of acting recklessly before a boat collision

Crash: This is one of the boats involved in the collision during a half-term sailing trip in October 2010

The jury heard that the girls had been urging Jones to go faster moments before the two inflatable speedboats crashed.  

Prosecutor Oliver Willmott said that four boats had illegally set off across the bay without using lights. 

'Two of the four boats were more powerful than the others and the defendants ran to the top of the slipway in order to get them,' he said.  

'Nicholas Sawyer was the chief instructor of the sailing course and he told the girls to be sensible. In fact, he said: "Don't f*** around."'  

Danger: The other boat involved in the crash, which took place when the boats did not have lights attached

Experienced: Morus and Jones were aged just 17 at the time of the accident, but were among the top young sailors in the country

In previous days, the boats had been used for 'wake jumping', the court heard.  

Mr Willmott said: 'This is where each boat jumps the other's wake for a thrill ride. It is also quite a potentially dangerous thing to do.  

'In the boat driven by Jones, there was effectively a request made by one or two people in the boat that they go faster, jump waves and swerve.  

'There came a point where Jones came across the path of Morus and they collided.  

'It was a sufficiently violent collision to throw two people into the water and to cause a third person to fall halfway into the water. A fourth young girl was thrown from one boat and landed in the other.  

'In the most severe case, a young girl suffered a brain injury of moderate severity.'  

The victim, an 11-year-old girl, has not been named.

Instructor Nicholas Sawyer and Cardiff Bay Yacht Club, organisers of the course in October 2010, have already admitted offences in connection with the accident.  

The court heard that Jones and Morus were not qualified to drive the high-powered boats at night.  

Mr Willmott told the jury: 'These girls were in a difficult position. They were 17 and had been coached in sailing to some considerable success by Nicholas Sawyer.  

'It was his idea to cross Cardiff Bay without lights at night and they did what he said. But did this collision just happen because of Nicholas Sawyer and the sailing club's bad plan - or because there was excess speed and a failure to keep a proper look out?  

'If you know you are close to other boats and without lights then you should be driving very carefully. It's common sense and it's good seamanship.'  

Morus and Jones, both 20, admit piloting the boats without navigation lights, but deny failing to travel at a safe speed and failing to keep a proper lookout.  

The trial continues.
