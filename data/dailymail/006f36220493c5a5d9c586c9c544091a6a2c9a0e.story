Andy Schleck, the 2010 winner, is out of the Tour de France following a crash involving a spectator on Monday's third stage from Cambridge to London.

Schleck (Trek Factory Racing) announced he would not be starting the 163.5-kilometre fourth stage from Le Touquet-Paris-Plage to Lille.

He wrote on Twitter: 'Very disappointed to let you know that I will not be able to start.

'My knee is too damaged from the crash. This is a huge blow for me.'

Schleck is a shadow of the figure who duelled with Alberto Contador for the 2010 yellow jersey and inherited the title after the Spaniard's win was quashed due to a doping violation.

He was riding the Tour in support of his brother Frank, who is already more than a minute behind race leader Vincenzo Nibali.

Trek said Schleck would travel to Basle, Switzerland, for further examination and possible surgery.

Schleck added in a team statement: 'I went on the rollers as soon as we arrived in Le Touquet, to get the muscles and tendons warmed up, but the pain is too much.

'I believed until that moment that I would start. I think I ignored the pain somehow, hiding it in the back of my head.

'I'm hugely disappointed. I was so happy to be here, racing with Frank in the Tour again.

'I'm sad to let the team down, to let Frank down. I was ready to help him defend his GC ambitions. I felt I was progressing, everything was coming back.'

The crash occurred when, spotting a pedestrian stood virtually in the road, racers were forced to break suddenly and Schleck fell from his bike.

The 29-year-old managed to get back to his feet and finished the race but will now take no further part in the Tour.
