A man whose wheelchair-bound, morbidly obese wife died last year after she was denied a spot on three different flights home from Europe has sued the airlines for $6 million.

Vilma Soltesz, who at the time was reported to have weighed 425 pounds (193 kg), had an amputated leg and suffered from diabetes and kidney disease.

She was found dead at her vacation home in Hungary in October after several aircraft crews repeatedly failed to accommodate her size despite telling her they could do so, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan.

Stranded: Vilma Soltesz, 56, from New York, died while on holiday in Hungary in October because she was told she could not board three separate flights

The lawsuit accused the three airlines of wrongful death and gross negligence.

The couple left their Bronx home in 
September on a Delta Air Lines plane, securing two seats for Vilma and 
one for her husband Janos, and arrived safely in Budapest on a vacation,
according to the lawsuit.

By October 2, Vilma Soltesz sought 
treatment at a hospital in Hungary when she fell ill, according to the 
lawsuit. She was released and told she could fly home but to see her 
doctor immediately upon her arrival, according to the lawsuit.

The pair tried to leave Budapest two 
weeks later on a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flight, with accommodations 
similar to what they received on their flight from the United States, 
according to the suit.

Struggle: In Prague although a local fire department were brought into 
to help move Mrs Soltesz into three seats assigned to her, they could not
lift her out of the wheelchair

But a captain told them to disembark
after Vilma Soltesz struggled to maneuver from her wheelchair into her 
assigned seats, the lawsuit says.

After waiting in a Budapest airport 
for more than five hours, the couple drove to Prague to catch a Delta 
flight they were assured could accommodate them. But Delta did not have 
an adequate wheelchair to transport Vilma Soltesz to her seat, the suit 
added.

'The Delta flight coordinator told 
Janos and Vilma that Delta ''did not have access to a skylift'' to get 
Vilma onto the aircraft from the rear, and that there was nothing more 
Delta could do for them,' the lawsuit stated.

Predicament: Mrs Soltesz had gained weight due to her illness and the airline said it did not have a seat-belt extender for her according to her husband

Later, on October 22, as several 
medics and firefighters helped her board a Lufthansa flight, the captain
told the couple they had to disembark because 'other passengers need to
catch a connecting flight and cannot be delayed further,' the lawsuit 
says.

'Exhausted and feeling ill,' Vilma 
Soltesz went to bed after the couple drove back to their vacation home 
in Veszprem, Hungary, the lawsuit says.

On October 24, Janos found her dead.

A Delta Air Lines spokesman said the 
airline had not been served with the lawsuit. Officials with Royal Dutch
Airlines and Lufthansa did not immediately respond to a request for 
comment.

An attorney for Mr Soltesz did not immediately return a call 
seeking comment.

Sue: Mrs Soltesz died from health complications in Hungary nine days after she was kicked off the first of three flights and now her death could now be the cause of a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against the airlines
