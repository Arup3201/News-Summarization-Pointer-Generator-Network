Two window washers dangling high in the air over the street Thursday morning were rescued by firefighters.

The two unidentified men were five stories above an Olympia, Washington street when their window washing platform began to malfunction. One of the workers was bleeding from the head when firefighters arrived.

The pair was working on the rear of the six-story building when the mishap occurred, an Olympia Fire Department statement said. It is not clear what caused the incident.

Bleeding: One of the window washers suffered a laceration to his head. The other was uninjured in the ordeal

Hanging on for his life: One of the window washers was dangling from the side of the building while the other remained in his window washing perch

Both men, reportedly employees of Ace Window Cleaning, based in Gig Harbor, appeared to be working from seats that were suspended in the air using cables.

One of the workers was still in his perch, but another appeared to be dangling from the side of the building when help arrived.

Three firefighter crews soon arrived on the scene just after 10.00 a.m., authorities said.One raced to the top of the building to make sure the line was secure and would continue to hold the men.

To the rescue: Firefighters raised a ladder up the side of the building to bring the men down

Back down to earth: The other widow washer being rescued

Another worked through the fifth-floor windows to assess the medical condition of the window washers, and a third raised a ladder up the side of the building to bring the duo down.

The injured man was helped out of his tangled gear and lowered to the ground for medical attention, according to fire officials.

The second worker was brought down shortly after, he suffered no injuries.

A person who answered the phone at a number listed for Ace Window Cleaning declined comment and hung up.
