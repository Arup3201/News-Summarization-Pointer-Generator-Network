Hull manager Steve Bruce believes Frank Lampard at his peak would have been worth up to £70million in the current climate.

The former Chelsea midfielder has returned to centre stage with three goals in a week for Manchester City, who signed him on a short-term loan following his move to New York City.

Lampard is the Blues' record goalscorer, netting 211 time in 13 years, and started his City tally with a dramatic strike against his previous employers last Sunday.

He followed up with two more against Sheffield Wednesday in a 7-0 Capital One Cup thrashing and the Tigers are next up at the KC Stadium on Saturday.

Hull boss Bruce is full of admiration for the 36-year-old's achievements and thinks a young Lampard would be one of the most expensive players on the planet if he was on the market today.

'How much would Frank Lampard be worth now if he was in his pomp? A 20 goals a year man for the last 15 years? He'd be worth £60 or £70million,' said Bruce.

'He's been quite a remarkable player. Every young player with any aspiration in the game should maybe have a look at him.

'He's 36 now and his fitness levels are staggering. He's been a staggering player.

'Frank has been a great player for the Premier League. The word great is used too much but if you look at his record, he's been a phenomenal player. Still doing it now at 36 is incredible.'

The midfielder scored against his old club Chelsea on Sunday, and has found his stride at  City
