Outrage: BBC Director General Tony Hall, pictured, pledged to cap payout deals following public anger at the amount spent on redundancy packages

The BBC has paid out more than £10million to staff in golden goodbyes over the last decade before giving them new jobs at the corporation.

The cost of the ‘revolving door’ payroll emerged only days after the BBC was made exempt from a government crackdown on the practice.

NHS bosses and council leaders were last week told they would be stripped of their ‘unfair’ redundancy packages if they were later rehired.

But the BBC was not included in the legislation to ‘protect its independence’, despite repeated criticism of the huge severance deals handed to departing members of staff.

The revelation about the extent of spending on rehired staff will heap further pressure on bosses at the corporation to explain the use of licence fee money. Figures from the corporation revealed that 286 full-time staff made redundant in the last 12 years and re-employed on permanent or fixed-term contracts received £10,230,905 in payouts.

Although the average payment was just under £36,000, some senior figures have been re-employed despite receiving payoffs of up to £365,000,

The BBC last night defended the payouts, claiming it has strict rules in place preventing recently departed staff from being employed again.

Contracted staff are not allowed to be employed for a year after their initial employment has ended, while freelance staff must wait three months.

However, the corporation’s head of human resources or three directors can bypass these rules in ‘exceptional circumstances’. The BBC has not disclosed how many times such exceptional cases have been permitted.

TaxPayers’ Alliance director John O’Connell accused the BBC of ‘wasteful behaviour’.

He said: ‘This lucrative revolving door must grind to a halt. This is a totally inappropriate use of the licence fee and is costing hard-pressed families a pretty penny.’

Under new rules announced by the Treasury last week, officials earning over £100,000 a year who take another job in the same public sector area within a year will have to pay back their redundancy package. But exceptions were made in the cases of the BBC, Bank of England and the Armed Forces.

Back in the building: Almost 300 employees who were made redundant in the last 12 years were given redundancy payouts totalling more than £10million, but were later re-hired on permanent or fix-term contracts

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: ‘In acknowledgement of its independence from Government, the BBC is not subject to the clawback measures I announced last week.

‘However, I am writing separately to the BBC to explain the measures we have put in place. People will expect it to have in place measures at least as stringent as the ones I announced and that they will be implemented rigorously.’

Criticism of the six-figure salaries routinely handed to senior BBC figures led to Tony Hall capping severance payments at £150,000 last year.

A National Audit Report in 2013 found senior BBC managers received a total of £25million in severance deals between 2009 and 2012.

Embattled director general George Entwistle was given a £470,000 severance deal after resigning in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal despite completing only 54 days of work.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Our rules are stricter than the civil service and during a 12-year period it is inevitable that a small number of staff will leave and re-join the BBC.’
