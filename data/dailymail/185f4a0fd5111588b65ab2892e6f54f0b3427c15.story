A 16-year-old Wimbledon schoolboy, Nick D'Aloisio, is meeting Silicon Valley royalty such as Apple's British-born design head Sir Jonathan Ive after his home-made app was picked as an App of the Week on iTunes. 

D'Aloisio's app, Summly, came to the attention of technology investor Li Ka-Shing, the world's eleventh richest man, and the schoolboy has delayed his mock GCSEs to fly to California to meet investors. 

'I was a bit worried about how people would react to my age, but luckily age doesn’t really come into it here,' said D'Aloisio.

Nick D'Aloisio who has developed an iPhone App 'Summly' which has been picked as an App of the Week by Apple and downloaded 115,000 times

'We’ve had amazing support in the Valley, and people have been really helpful.'

The app has already been downloaded more than 115,000 times since launching several weeks ago, and was chosen by Apple as its app of the week.

Called Summly, the free app can condense long web pages into text bullet points that can be easily read, 'boiling down' longer pieces by relevance.

The app came to the attention 
of renowned investor Li Ka-shing, who 
backed the idea, and this week Nick was in Silicon Valley meeting 
investors and potential customers.

'Getting Apple’s backing has been amazing. Six months ago when I was fine tuning the idea I knew it had potential, but the speed with which things have taken off has surprised me.'

He has had to ask his teachers at King’s College School in Wimbledon to delay his mock GCSEs so that he could visit investors. D'Aloisio hopes he can sell the app and become a millionaire.

Nick also met one of his heroes, iPhone designer Sir Jonathan Ive

He runs the firm from his parents’ home in Wimbledon.

His father, Lou Montilla, works at Morgan Stanley and mother Diana D’Aloisio, a lawyer, have both been hugely supportive, although Nick admits it may be time to move the firm to new premises.

'There are several people around the world we are looking to hire and I like the idea of looking for an office,' he said. His brother Matthew, 12, had also been helping. 

'He’s slightly more critical of things than other people. Sometimes it’s jokey, sometimes serious — he keeps me grounded.'

Li Ka-Shing is Asia's richest man and the 11th richest person on the planet. He has a long history of tech investment, and was interested in D'Aloisio's app

Nick got his first Apple Mac four years ago and cut down on gaming to design software.

'Inevitably we’ll license it or sell the technology, but I want to continue with my education, and hopefully go to university to study philosophy. I do have several other ideas as well, but for the moment I just want to see how Summly can grow.'

Mrs D’Aloisio said they were 'very proud' of Nick’s achievements. 'We knew he’d do things but we didn’t expect him to do such great things so young. He’s very motivated.'
