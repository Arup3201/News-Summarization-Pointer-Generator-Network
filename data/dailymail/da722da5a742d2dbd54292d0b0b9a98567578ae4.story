One former champion lost his life and the other lost his game. They say great courses produce great champions but Pinehurst is a great course with a US Open legacy both tragic and mysterious.

Payne Stewart and Michael Campbell were in the prime of their professional lives when they won in 1999 and 2005 respectively. Stewart was the once-brash bon vivant who had matured gracefully. In winning by one stroke, he had words only for the vanquished, Phil Mickelson.

Tragic: Payne Stewart died a few months after winning the 1999 US Open

A month later he put an arm around Tiger Woods's shoulder and took him for a walk along the fairways in Waterville in Ireland and sang songs with the locals. That September he was the only American to emerge with any credit from the Ryder Cup nonsense at Brookline, conceding a 20ft putt to Colin Montgomerie because he was so sickened by the abuse the Scot was receiving.

Three weeks on, he was on a private plane that never reached its destination. The saddest thing I have ever covered was the tournament that followed in Houston.Â Stewart had barely entered his 40s and had won over all his peers. This was fate at its most savagely cruel.

They stopped Parliament and brought a television into the debating chamber when Campbell battled Tiger Woods down the stretch. It was Monday morning in his native New Zealand and there was no stopping the celebratory mood when Cambo did what few others ever managed and jousted successfully with Woods in his prime. Later that year, he won the World Match Play at Wentworth. When he went home to Wellington, they organised a Welcome Home parade.

Sealed with a kiss: Michael Campbell celebrates winning the 2005 US Open

The years since have not been so kind. Campbell didn't know what to do after achieving his lifetime's ambition of winning a major. Some days he struggled to get out of bed. For years he struggled to turn in a good score. He hasn't won a single tournament since that golden year.

In January, I had a beer with him in Abu Dhabi. He had just got the news that a foot injury was far worse than he thought and it would be several months before we saw him again. We still haven't seen him. Last month, he combined the news he would be missing from Pinehurst with the sad addendum he had split up from his wife, Julie.

It is not just the winners, either. Look at the runners-up from 1999 and 2005. Mickelson is playing under the cloud of being the subject of an FBI investigation into potential insider trading; Woods, like Campbell, is sitting at home.  At Pinehurst this week we will revel in the inevitable twists and turns a major brings and end up saluting the winner of America's national championship. But let's hope the victory brings lasting joy, rather than a sense of sadness and loss in the years to come.

Quote of the week

'I don't know 100 per cent but I'm pretty sure I grounded my club in the bunker. For five days I practised but I couldn't get it off my mind. It's heartbreaking but it's the right decision.'

Honest: Jason Millard disqualified himself for possible rules breach

Five days after qualifying for the US Open, American Jason Millard (pictured above) disqualified himself for this possible rules breach nobody else had seen. Say what you like about golfers but when it comes to integrity on the field of play, they stand alone.

It's a major scandal that Brit star Charley is missing out

Looking down the entry list at every major championship usually affords a moment's reflection to lament the absence of one or two players.

There is one omission from the US Women's Open at Pinehurst next week, however, that is so wrong on every level it provokes a sense of outrage.

Teen sensation: Charley Hull from Woburn is the best young female golfer in Europe

Charley Hull from Woburn is, by common consent, the best young female golfer in Europe. The 18-year-old is also No 1 on the European women's order of merit. And yet she is not playing. Just to put the tin lid on matters, the bigwigs at the United States Golf Association are presently congratulating themselves on what they perceive as their unique exercise in democracy.

A men's and women's Open are being played back to back on the same course for the first time and already we are being treated to homilies proclaiming equal treatment of the sexes.

How hypocritical. Never mind that the women are being paid far less than the men in prize money. If the entry criteria for both events was the same, Hull would have qualified several times over. She is 33rd in the world, was the star of the last Solheim Cup and finished seventh in the season's first major, for heaven's sake.

And how disrespectful for the European No 1 not to be exempt. Imagine if they tried that with the men!

The USGA are forever telling us about their efforts at growing the game among juniors and here was a golden chance to offer a special exemption to a young role model fully deserving of one. Instead, they blew it. Shame on them.
