It was enough to leave the middle classes choking on their focaccia (well, if they'd had any to hand).

A power cut left hundreds of Ocado customers without their online shopping at the weekend.

Around 1,700 were told their groceries, mainly from Waitrose, had been cancelled or delayed – some were even warned their Ocado van would not arrive until 3.30am.

Many complained that their weekend lunches and dinner parties had been ruined by a lack of such essentials as pork belly or pistachios.

Jennifer Skillen, of Gloucestershire, posted a picture of Ocado avocados that were brown inside and wrote: 'I am rarely disappointed with Ocado but these avocados clearly didn't read 'ripen at home' on the label!'

The problems began on Friday when, according to Ocado drivers, a power cut at a distribution centre caused orders to be delayed. An Ocado spokesman later attributed the delays to a faulty microchip.

Shoppers soon went on Twitter to vent their frustration. Belinda Moore, a communications director, wrote: 'You are kidding me! Whole delivery cancelled. There's not a snowflake in miles of London. So unimpressed.' 

She added: 'Can't wait to get home, get the kids to bed and then spend two hours doing the food shop.'

Sandra Oliver was told to expect a delay of five hours before it was eventually cancelled. She wrote: 'Ridiculous that my shopping is late again tonight – it's becoming a regular occurrence these days.'

Helen Bullock tweeted: 'Unacceptable service. Notified at 11.30pm that 9pm delivery would not be turning up. Second time now. Loyalty being challenged big time.'

Simon Langford was told to expect a two-hour delay on his delivery which was due at 10.30pm, and said: 'Really? I won't get that sleep back.'

And a Twitter user named Charlie D wrote: 'Right royal cock-up with Ocado. My delivery has gone from being 2hrs 50mins late to 3hrs 30mins late – as if I want it at 1am.'

Other customers later complained about items being out of stock or arriving past their best.

Jennifer Skillen, from Gloucestershire, posted a picture of her Ocado avocados that were brown inside and wrote: 'I am rarely disappointed with Ocado but these avocados clearly didn't read 'ripen at home' on the label!'

Another user called Palola had items missing from her order. She said: 'Wanted to roast a pork belly today from my order but have been emailed to say it's missing and no alternative – why?! Thank God I also ordered a chicken otherwise Sunday roast would be ruined!'

A spokesman for Ocado said: 'A minor technical fault at our Hatfield Customer Fulfilment Centre on Friday caused issues for a small number of our customers.

'The fault was fixed within a day and affected customers have been contacted to rearrange delivery. We are very sorry for the inconvenience caused and we have offered a money-off voucher as compensation to those affected.'
