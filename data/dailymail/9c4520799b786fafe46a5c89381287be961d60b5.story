A New York man has admitted to trying to extort $200,00 from embattled celebrity chef Paula Deen as dealt with a backlash over her admitted use of racial slurs in the past.

Prosecutors filed a notice in U.S. District Court in Savannah last 
Wednesday saying 62-year-old Thomas George Paculis 'has signed his plea 
agreement.' A change-of-plea hearing was scheduled Friday afternoon 
before Judge William T. Moore Jr. No details of the agreement were given
in the court filings.

Paculis' defense attorney, Richard Darden, declined to 
comment Monday. James Durham, chief assistant prosecutor for the U.S. 
Attorney's Office in Savannah, also would not discuss the deal.

Thomas George Paculis, 62, has pleaded guilty to extortion charges after allegedly threatening to go to the press with statements made by Paula Deen unless she paid him off

Downfall: Paula Deen, pictured weeping during a recent appearance on the Today show, was fired from the Food Network last month after admitting to using the 'N-word'

Paculis of Newfield, New York, pleaded not guilty July 16 to two counts 
of using interstate communications to try to extort money from Deen. The
FBI says he contacted one of Deen's lawyers by email a few days after 
Deen's culinary empire began to crumble when documents became public 
showing that the former Food Network star acknowledged using the 'N-word' 
in the past.

Deen made the statement under oath as she was questioned by
attorneys in a 2012 harassment and discrimination lawsuit by former 
employee Lisa Jackson.

In the June 24 email to 
attorney Gary Hodges, Paculis said he was 
about to go public with statements that were 'true and damning enough 
that the case for Jackson will be won on its merits alone' and added 
'there is a price for such information,' according to a criminal 
complaint filed in the case. Hodges contacted the FBI, which directed 
the attorney to communicate with Paculis by email and later by phone.

Details of Deen's alleged remarks and the relationship between Paculis and Deen remains unclear.

Strangers: FBI agents investigating the extortion case showed Deen photos of Paculis, and she didn't recognize him or his name

Authorities say Paculis initially asked that Deen pay him $250,000 to
keep quiet, but Hodges negotiated the amount down to $200,000. Paculis 
told Hodges he was house-sitting in New York, didn't have a car and 
didn't know how he was going to collect the money, the complaint says.

Federal agents arrested Paculis in early July and brought him to 
Georgia. After entering his initial plea, Paculis was granted a $10,000 
bond and allowed to return to New York on the condition that he stay 
away from Deen and her businesses.

Records in the case don't say 
specifically what information Paculis claimed to know about Deen. The 
FBI said it showed Deen a photograph of the suspect and she said she 
didn't recognize him or his name.

The civil suit filed last year by Jackson, a former manager of Uncle 
Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House, says she was sexually harassed and 
worked in an environment rife with racial slurs and innuendo. The 
restaurant is owned by Deen and her brother, Bubba Hiers.

Asked
in her deposition if she had ever used the N-word, Deen replied: ‘Yes, 
of course.’ But she also insisted ‘it’s been a very long time.’

Threat: Paculis wrote several emails to Deen's lawyer, telling him that the information in his possession 'would damage your client in so many ways that it would sink your ship before it left the dock'

On
his Facebook page, Paculis got into an argument with another user about
the scandal surrounding Paula Deen's racially charged statements, 
writing in a post from June 29: 'the woman is a raceist [sic].'

Like Deen, Peculis owns a restaurant in Savannah. His establishment is called the Troupe Square Cafe. Photos on his Facebook page show the 63-year-old sporting a white double-breasted chef's jacket and posing against the background of a kitchen.

Before going into the restaurant business, the 62-year-old worked as an EMT.

In 2004, he had a run-in with the law in connection to a DUI incident that landed him in jail for 14 days. He was also fined more than $900 and sentenced to probation and community service.
