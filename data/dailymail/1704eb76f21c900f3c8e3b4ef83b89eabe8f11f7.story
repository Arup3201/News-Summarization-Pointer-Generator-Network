The Foreign Office minister who quit because of ‘intolerable’ expenses rules is the owner of a million-pound mansion, bought using profits from the sale of his taxpayer-funded home.

Mark Simmonds, the MP for Boston and Skegness, resigned on Monday complaining his income did not cover the cost of renting a Westminster flat big enough for his family.

But the 50-year-old already owns a seven-bedroom grade-II listed house with a heated swimming pool.

Mr Simmonds has claimed more than £1.7million in expenses since becoming a Tory MP in 2001. He also made more than £500,000 by selling a house on which the taxpayer paid the mortgage interest.

Six months after becoming an MP, he bought a five-bedroom house in Putney, south-west London, for £650,000. From 2001 to 2009, he claimed £2,000 a month for the mortgage interest.

When expenses rules were changed to ban such claims, he sold the property in January 2011 for £1,187,500 – £537,000 more than he paid.

The same month, he used the massive profit to help buy the 17th-century property in his constituency for £900,000.

Set in 15 acres, it has formal gardens, a garage for three cars, a tennis court and a heated outdoor swimming pool.

Mr Simmonds' claims that he could not afford to live in London and that the pressure on his family life had become 'intolerable' were dismissed as 'total nonsense' by one Labour MP

It is now valued at £1.25million and was partly created from the ruins of an ancient abbey where King John reputedly once stayed. Yesterday, an Audi 4x4 and a Mercedes were parked outside.

Mr Simmonds said on Monday that he will leave Parliament at next year’s election because he rarely sees his three children, who live in his constituency.

'If MPs want to get into the business of travelling extensively from Westminster to the outer reaches of London to rent a flat then that’s up to them. But that’s not the lifestyle I want and not the lifestyle I have chosen'

He said his expenses ‘do not stretch to renting a flat near Westminster large enough for my children, so I stay in a hotel. I hate it’.

When asked how a rental allowance of £27,875 a year plus £2,500 for each child was not enough, he said: ‘If MPs want to get into the business of travelling extensively from Westminster to the outer reaches of London to rent a flat then that’s up to them.

‘But that’s not the lifestyle I want and not the lifestyle I have chosen.’

It is understood Mr Simmonds has been charging the taxpayer to stay in a four-star hotel close to the Houses of Parliament.

He receives a salary of £89,435. In 2012/13 he claimed £176,177.87 in expenses, including a salary of up to £25,000 for his wife Lizbeth in her role as his office manager.

Mr Simmonds is still chairman of the property business he founded in 1999.

From June 2011 to September 2012 he also earned £50,000 a year as a strategic adviser to medical provider Circle Healthcare.

Mr
 Simmonds’ two daughters, aged 15 and 13, and son, aged 12, are all 
educated at private schools with fees that start from £13,350 a year.

'His comments will gain little public sympathy when under his government most working families, especially in London, are facing a cost of living crisis'

Grahame Morris, Labour MP

Labour MP John Mann poured scorn on the idea that the Commons housing allowance was not enough to afford to live in London.

He said his complaint was ‘nonsense’. He said: ‘The £28,000 he can get is more than the average salary in his constituency. It’s simply untrue that you can’t rent in London for that much.’

Mr Mann's remarks came as MailOnline discovered a host of luxury flats within half a mile of Westminster, which Mr Simmonds could easily afford using his taxpayer-funded allowance.

MailOnline has found a number of luxury flats within half a mile of Westminster which he could easily afford from his taxpayer-funded housing allowance.

If the Tory MP insisted on bringing down his family for weekends, he has a number of options for accommodation close to Westminster.

Mr Simmonds could afford a luxury, fully-furnished property with access to communal gardens and leisure facilities - including a pool and a gym just minutes from Parliament near the London Eye

If the former Foreign Office minister could cope with a 20 minute train ride from Bromley, he could rent a four bed house in the South London commuter belt

There are also scores of four-bed family homes in London's sought-after suburbs - home to hundreds of thousands of Conservative voters - within Mr Simmonds' budget.

For a home within easy walking distance from Westminster Mr Simmonds could rent a mid-terrace Georgian house conversion with three large double bedrooms, a big family kitchen, living room and a garden in Oval - less than 2 miles from Parliament. The house costs £24,444 a year.

If he was willing to use public transport, the allowance would get him a luxury four bed semi-detached property with large garden in Bromley, South London, for £27,000 a year.

Bromley – a core Conservative-stronghold in London’s commuter belt – is just 20 minutes away from Victoria station, which is just 15 minutes walk from Parliament.

If Mr Simmonds opted for a one-bed flat for himself to stay in London, while his family stayed in his constituency his ‘generous’ Commons housing allowance would allow him to stay in the lap of luxury.

A quick search on online estate agents 'rightmove' shows a number of luxury flats available to rent with a stone's throw of Parliament

According to the online estate agents ‘rightmove’, Mr Simmonds could afford a one-bedroom apartment less than half a mile from Parliament.

The luxury, fully-furnished property allows access to a communal gardens and leisure facilities - including a pool and a gym.

Another apartment just a stones throw from Westminster available in Mr Simmonds' price bracket is a 'beautiful one bedroom fully furnished apartment with a secure underground car parking space close to local amenities and St James' underground tube station'.

'The property was fully refurbished in 2009 and remains in excellent condition throughout. The property also has a private balcony that overlooks the gardens to the rear.'

According to the estate agents renting the property 'residents of Vestry Court enjoy exclusive use of the private swimming pool, Jacuzzi, sauna and gym facilities'.

It is 'conveniently located for access to London's West End, and Waterloo and Westminster underground stations', according to the estate agent.
