Members of the livestreaming site Twitch may have had their personal details stolen in what the company is describing as 'unauthorised access' to accounts.

The Amazon-owned website allows users to livestream games as they play, with fellow users able to watch and listen in.

It confirmed the site had been targeted in a blog post - although resisted calling it a hack or cyber attack - and told users that all passwords had been reset.

Amazon bought the website in 2014 for $970 million (£650 million), outbidding internet giant Google for the company.

Twitch now receives more than 50 million unique visitors a month.

In a post on the company's official blog, Twitch said: 'We are writing to let you know that there may have been unauthorised access to some Twitch user account information.

'For your protection, we have expired passwords and stream keys and have disconnected accounts from Twitter and YouTube. 

The suspected cyber attack on Twitch joins the growing list of notable breaches in recent months.

Following a compromise of eBay usernames and passwords last year, there was the celebrity nude photo leak that affected A-list stars including actress Jennifer Lawrence.

Thousands of photos were posted online after iCloud accounts were attack by hackers, who used brute force password-guessing software to breach security.

Then in December, Sony Pictures was hit by a large-scale cyber attack that saw employee records posted online, as well as upcoming movies from the studio.

Reports suggested that the hack was the work of North Korea in response to the Sony movie The Interview, which depicted the assassination of North Korea leader Kim Jong-Un.

Sony's Playstation Network was also affected by the breach, suffering service problems over the Christmas period.

'As a result, you will be prompted to create a new password the next time you attempt to log into your Twitch account.

'We also recommend that you change your password at any website where you use the same or a similar password. We will communicate directly with affected users with additional details.'

The website additionally said in an email to customers that the information compromised could include usernames, email addresses, passwords and even some limit credit card information, which Twitch described as 'card type, truncated card number and expiration date'.

However, it added: 'Twitch does not store or process full credit or debit card information, so your card number is safe.'

The site has so far declined to comment beyond the official blog post.

Commenting on the attack, Mark James, security specialist at ESET said: 'Gaming sites have always been a lucrative target. 

'Not only do they represent gamers that may use the same login and passwords as similar sites but they also enable the possibility of other electronic goods to be stolen and sold elsewhere, in game items, in game gold. 

'There’s no perfect advice for when your details are stolen but changing your password is certainly one of the best. 

'The very best is to strengthen the importance of having unique passwords for each and every login you have - that way if your password is found it’s useless on another site.' 

The website added in an email to customers that compromised information could include usernames, email addresses, passwords and even some limit credit card information. However, it doesn't store full credit or debit card information, so stressed that individual card numbers are safe
