Syrian President Bashar al-Assad vowed to strike against ‘terrorists’ with an iron fist today and blamed a foreign conspiracy for trying to destabilise Syria.

As the mass uprising continued against his rule with security forces accused of shooting dead 10 people, the beleaguered Mr Assad derided the Arab League for its attempts to halt violence in the 10-month-old revolt against his rule. 

The president's 100-minute speech, his first public address since June, contained vague promises of reform, but no sweeping concessions that might split an opposition now determined to end more than four decades of domination by the Assad family.   

Heavy handed: Syrian President Bashar Assad today refused to step down and vowed to meet any further unrest with an 'iron fist'

Keeping an eye out: Syrians across the country watched President Bashar Assad's address on television

And Mr Assad, 46, gave no hint that he was willing to relinquish the power he inherited on his father's death in 2000 promising : ‘I am not someone who abandons responsibility.

'I am in this position because of support from the people and if I leave it will be because of the desire of the people.

‘Our priority now is to regain security which we basked in for decades, and this can only be achieved by hitting the terrorists with an iron hand…we will not be lenient with those who work with outsiders against the country.’   

The hardline speech came as Turkey, Syria’s neighbour and one time friend, warned of civil war and Israel said it is making preparations for the fall of Mr Assad and a flood of refugees into the captured Golan Heights.

Contrast: Assad's speech came the day after anti-government protesters carried the coffin of Muhammad Khaled Al-Kaheel, who they say was killed during clashes in Damascus

In a scathing attack on the Arab 
League, which has sent monitors to check Syria's compliance with an Arab
peace plan after suspending it from the 22-member body in November, he 
said : ‘The Arab League has failed for six decades to take a position in
the Arab interest ... We should not be surprised.’

He said Syria would not 'close the door' to any Arab proposal that respected its sovereignty and unity.

Syria, Mr Assad complained, was the target of a relentless foreign media campaign. Blaming unrest on ‘outside planning’, he said, ‘The outside now regrettably includes Arabs.

‘We will declare victory soon, Mr Assad said, raising fears the military crackdown was about to increase. ‘When I leave this post, it will be also based upon the people's wishes,’ he added.

The address broadcast live from Damascus University was a clear message there would be no concessions and little was going to change despite international calls for sweeping reforms and Mr Assad to stand down.

The United Nations said last month that more than 5,000 civilians have been killed since protests began last March with repeated reports of snipers cutting down men, women and children.

Syrian authorities say they are fighting armed groups – there is evidence that army deserters have joined the opposition and are targeting government forces – and that around 2,000 members of their own security forces have been killed so far.

Activists claimed Syrian security forces shot dead at least 10 people in an eastern city of Deir el-Zour yesterday despite the presence of the Arab observer mission in the area.

Mr Assad’s approach to unrest, casting it as a foreign conspiracy and countering it with violent repression and hazy promises of reform, resembled that of other Arab leaders confronted by mass protests in the past year. Three have been toppled.

Despite the persistent upheaval in Syria, in which insurgent attacks have begun to eclipse civilian demonstrations, Mr Assad's security forces seem to retain the upper hand. 

Mr Assad acknowledged some ‘wrong actions’ by the authorities but despite the high casualty toll, he denied any policy to shoot demonstrators. ‘There is no cover for anyone. There are no orders for anyone to open fire on any citizen,’ he stressed.     

Opposition officials dismissed the contents of the speech. ‘Bashar is completely removed from reality, as if he is talking about a country other than Syria,’ said a Syria-based activist who identified himself by his nickname, Abu Hamza, because of fear of reprisals. ‘After 10 months of bloodshed, he comes out and talks of a foreign conspiracy.’

Aftermath: A suicide bomber earlier this week killed at least 25 people and wounded dozens more in the al-Midan district in central Damascus

Investigation: Several riot shields were visible in a wrecked police bus behind this destroyed vehicle in the suicide blast earlier this week

Standing room only: Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have taken to the country's streets to demand the end of the current regime, such as during this protest at the end of December

Huge: The protest at the end of December was believed to be the biggest ever series of protests against President Bashar Assad

Burhan Ghalioun, head of the opposition Syrian National Council, warned that Mr Assad’s emphasis on restoring order meant he is ‘backing away from his own pledge to the Arab League plan.’

He described Mr Assad's speech as dangerous because he had ‘insisted on using violence against our people, considered the revolution a terrorist conspiracy and thus undercut any Arab or non-Arab initiative to find a political solution to the crisis’.

Reviewing progress since the 165 monitors began work on December 26 – two were injured in protests last week, the Arab League said on Sunday Syria had only partly kept an agreement to stop violence, withdraw troops from cities, free prisoners, provide media access and open a political dialogue. 

Escalating: Anger is growing as tens of thousands continue to protest against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad

Anger: Clashes have broken out over the last 10 months between Syrian security forces and unarmed protesters

Many of Mr Assad's critics say the Arab monitoring mission has failed to halt the bloodshed and is only giving the authorities more time to crack down on protesters.

The struggle in Syria, Iran's only Arab ally, has alarmed its neighbours: Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Israel and Iraq.   

Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, a former friend of Assad who has become one of his fiercest critics, warned yesterday : ‘The situation in Syria is heading towards a religious, sectarian, racial war, and this needs to be prevented.’

Meanwhile, Israel’s military chief, Lieutenant-General Benny Gantz, told a parliamentary committee yesterday : ‘Assad cannot continue to hold onto power…on the day that the regime falls, it is expected to result in a blow to the Alawite sect. We are preparing to take in Alawite refugees on the Golan Heights.'      

Israel should also prepare for the possibility that cornered authorities in Damascus could 'as a lifesaver ... act against us', the general added.
