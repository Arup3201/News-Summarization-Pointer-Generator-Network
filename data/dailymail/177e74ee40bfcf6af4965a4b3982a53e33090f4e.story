The mother of a 2-year-old Georgia girl who suffered horrific burns to much of her body in a freak gasoline fire said it was her 4-year-old sister who likely saved her life.

Alyssa Calhoun was injured Saturday when a friend poured gasoline onto a backyard slide to make it more slippery.

As the toddler was sliding down, authorities believe a spark from static electricity ignited the gas at the Loganville-area home, engulfing Alyssa in flames.

Jennifer
Lollis, the girls' mother, said her older daughter Kayleigh, who just 
turned 4 Tuesday, ran into the house to alert her father,

'Daddy! Sissy's on fire!' the toddler screamed, according to the mother.

Alyssa remained in a medically induced coma at Grady Memorial Hospital Tuesday night after suffering burns to 60 per cent of her body,

‘If it wouldn’t have been for Kayleigh, she probably wouldn’t be here,’ Jennifer Lollis told Atlanta Journal Constitution.

Authorities are treating this as an accident and do not plan to file charges in the case.

Lollis,
who lives with her daughters in Covington, said the girls were spending
the weekend with their father when the accident happened at around 11.15am Saturday in the backyard of 26-year-old Christopher Calhoun's Loganville home.

According to deputies, the man's 2-year-old daughter, Alyssa, was sliding down the blue plastic slide, which another child had coated with gasoline, when static electricity sparked a fire, setting her clothes alight.

Mr Calhoun had just stepped inside the house when the accident happened. He heard his daughter Kayleigh's screams and ran outside to see her sister engulfed in flames, MyFox Atlanta.

Deputies say the father grabbed the burning girl and put her in the shower to extinguish the fire before calling 911.

Doctors
told the mother that her daughter is lucky to be alive. The 
21-month-old girl had undergone a 4-hour surgery - the first of several 
procedures she will have to endure on her long road to recovery.

Much
of her burns are third-degree, but her back took the brunt of the 
damage. She will likely remain in the hospital for the next several 
months, followed by a protracted rehabilitation period.

Aftermath: The fire melted the 2-year-old's shoes (pictured), and she was rushed to a hospital in critical condition

Miss
Lollis insisted that while it was a freak accident, it could have been 
prevented had her daughters been under their father's supervision.
