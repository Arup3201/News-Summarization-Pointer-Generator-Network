It is the heartwarming film that has made fans laugh all over the world and perhaps even consider planning their own retirement escape.

But the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel's hilarious comedy of errors is just the half of it, according to one couple who followed their dream of building a life in India.

From monsoons to massive renovation bills, Britons Norman and Carole Steen have faced it all after exchanging the grey skies of Birmingham for the tropical paradise of Goa, where they took on a dilapidated building with hopes of turning it into their very own marigold hotel. 

Norman and Carole Steen, from Birmingham, moved to Goa to renovate a dilapidated building and set up their very own marigold hotel 

If this sounds like the plot of the newly-released film, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, that's because it is eerily similar - right down to the hurdles that the Steens had to overcome.

Mr Steen, 61, said: 'We first started visiting India in the 1990s and it took us that long to get over the Delhi belly.

'Squid is still off the menu for us to this day.

'When we took over the property in 2005, it came with a whole host of problems. 

'Every room needed a facelift from top to bottom.

After purchasing the run-down building in 2005, the Steens have had to contend with a host of problems and continuous maintenance

'There was no plumbing in it at all. 

'There were only two lightbulbs in the house and no bathrooms.

'It cost around £15,000 for the structural work and this involved digging a metre-deep trench round the whole house.

'Every four years we need to inject chemicals into the walls and spray every bit of timber to make sure we don't get termites.'

From termite infestations to monsoon damage, it cost around £15,000 to take on all the structural work and 14 months to complete

The experiences of the Steens sounds much like the plot of 2011's hit film, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, starring Dev Patel

When the Steens, who are both retired lecturers, took over the property, they found the roof of the building was already home to a colony of long-tailed langur monkeys.

Mr Steen said: 'The langurs running around on the roof, coupled with the four-month period of monsoons and high winds, meant the roofing tiles needed constant repairs. 

'The last time we had our roof done, we had to buy 1,500 new tiles.

'It took 14 long months to complete the renovation of the property and it's one of those houses which constantly requires maintenance.'

Mrs Steen, 60, said: 'Moving to India comes with frustrations. 

'We arrived with the intention of taking over a colonial estate which is 700 years old, and it took a lot of fixing up.

'Even before we had even moved out there, we had to get through a whole host of paperwork to overcome the legalities of buying property and setting up a business in India. 

'spent 10 years planning before we finally made the move.'

The pair arrived with the intention of taking over a colonial estate, but at 700 years old, it required a lot of fixing up 

The sequel to the 2011 film, called The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, brings back the original stars, such as Judi Dench

This year, the Steens are celebrating ten years in India and their beloved Casa Susegad is more successful than ever 

This year, the Steens are celebrating ten years in India and their property, the Casa Susegad, is currently benefitting from a wave of renewed interest in India among UK retirees, largely due to the success of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and its sequel.  

Carole said: 'I am a huge fan of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. 

'I took my mum to see it and told her it was a bit like my life out in India.

'I loved it. I can't wait to see the new film.'

In fact, the property is currently benefitting from a renewed wave of interest thanks to the release of The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

Carole also added that she was very glad that India was becoming a more attractive holiday destination for elderly British retirees

Carole said she was glad that India was becoming a more attractive holiday destination for elderly people.

She said: 'While we love the country, just remember that it's very different to the UK. 

When we came out here, we didn't have a camera crew or a director - all the hard work was done by ourselves.

'But as a country, India is full of beautiful gems. 

From the Himalayan landscape to the ancient temples, I think we will be many lifetimes over before we get bored of this place.

'We have absolutely no regrets about moving over here to start our own exotic marigold hotel. 

It's definitely been worth it.'
