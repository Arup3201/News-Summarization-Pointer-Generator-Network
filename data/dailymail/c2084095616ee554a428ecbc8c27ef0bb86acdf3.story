Fear: Officials warned of the possibility of a Mumbai-style firearms attack on a crowded place

Medicine is being stockpiled in readiness for a biological attack on a city centre or train station by terrorists, security officials revealed yesterday.

The chilling prospect of biological warfare on our streets was included in a Home Office list of threats facing the UK.

Officials also warned of the possibility of a Mumbai-style firearms attack on a crowded place, and surface-to-air missiles being used to shoot down a passenger jet.

According to the document, handed to MPs, there are emerging fears about a ‘large-scale terrorist attack using biological agents’.

No further information was given about the nature of the threat - but biological warfare can involve the release of a deadly virus or bacteria, such as smallpox.

The Home Office report, called Contest, says: ‘We have increased the stocks of medical supplies and put in place better plans to improve the speed and coverage of the health response.’ 

Charles Farr, head of the Home Office’s Office of Security and Counter-Terrorism, said one potential source of biological weapons was UK universities, where science labs use materials with a ‘dual purpose’.

Universities have been asked to improve security to prevent fanatics being able to steal the biological agents.

Other current threats to the UK include:

The report said the overall threat to the UK had diversified beyond al Qaeda plots developed from within Pakistan to other areas.

More than 150 foreign nationals have been kidnapped by Islamist terrorist groups since 2008, at least 13 of whom were British, the report said.

In a worrying trend, numbers last year were more than double those in 2010.

Fanatics linked to al Qaeda and other groups have received at least £40million to fund terrorism as a result.

Officials also raised the prospect of a jet carrying British passengers being shot out of the sky using surface-to-air weapons, when passing over North Africa.

A number of weapons have gone missing in the chaos which followed the downfall of the Gaddafi regime in Libya. Planes carrying Westerners are considered an attractive target.

Concerns remain about the ‘trend for terrorists to use firearms as part of an attack’, officials said.

Specialist teams of police and emergency services have been trained to respond to terrorists attempting a mass casualty attack on a hotel, train station or city centre in the UK.

British jihadists currently fighting in Syria pose a real threat to the UK as it is feared some are being trained to carry out terror attacks when they return.

Between 70 and 100 British fighters have been enlisted by anti-Assad group Jabhat al-Nusra which it is believed is looking to broaden its activities beyond Syria's borders.

Many of the fighters who have travelled to the UK are first-time warriors and several have been killed by President Assad's forces.

Most of those involved in the fighting come from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds.

They include young Asians, North Africans and converts to Islam.

On Monday a 31-year-old man in East London became the eighth person in Britain to be arrested as part of inquiries into recruitment and organisation for the Syrian conflict.

The report also warns the threat to the UK from al Qaeda allies such as al Qaeda in the Maghreb in North Africa has heightened in the last year.

It follows a recent warning by Sir Jonathan Evans, the head of MI5, that the chaos caused by the Arab Spring has created new terrorist training camps for jihadis intent on attacking Britain.

Mr Farr warned that Syria had become ‘particularly challenging” with large numbers of foreign fighters, including from the UK, active in Syria.

Some 600 terrorist attacks involving Syrian groups took place last year, including 60 suicide deaths. Whitehall sources have suggested there could be 70 British fanatics who have travelled to Syria.

The fear is that they will travel back to the UK to carry out attacks here.

Mr Farr said threats from terrorism were spreading across a wider area into lawless countries with no recognised government.

The report said: ‘This poses significant challenges to our national security and to the security and intelligence agencies and departments working on counter-terrorism.

‘Operating in these areas is difficult and dangerous, requires very significant resources and is complicated and at times made impossible by the breakdown of governance and law and order.’

Asked whether counter-terrorism efforts faced funding cuts, Mr Farr said: ‘I don’t think that counter-terrorism is immune from the sort of efficiencies being found elsewhere.

'We’re looking at every bit of counter-terrorism to identify those savings.’
