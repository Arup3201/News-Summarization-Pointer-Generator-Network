Radio presenter Nicky Campbell said our terrible attitude towards littering makes many parks look like rubbish dumps

Not so long ago, I was taking a walk in South London with my dog Maxwell, when an expensive 4x4 swept towards me out of a garage forecourt.

Inside was a woman, with her two children sitting in the back in impeccable school uniforms. As she pulled alongside me, to my astonishment she casually chucked two plastic shopping bags out the window. Before she could pull into the road, I asked her somewhat forcibly what kind of example she thought she was setting for her children.

Without even deigning to look me in the eye, she pretended she hadn’t heard me. Then, eyes front and nose in the air, she drove her gas-guzzling monster away, leaving the plastic bags to dance in the air in her slipstream. Though I don’t supposed she cared in the least, it will take those bags centuries to rot away.

That depressing incident hammered home the fact that litter louts can be found across the social spectrum, as you’ll discover whether you pay a visit to a greyhound racing track or the Glastonbury festival or even the Henley Royal Regatta: at the end of the day, the rubbish that’s chucked on the ground is appalling.

We have a terrible attitude to dropping litter in this country — which is why some of our parks and commons look like rubbish dumps, with the occasional patch of green showing through. At this time of year especially when the sun is shining and people congregate outdoors, it’s shocking.

Before you dismiss me as a boring old Victor Meldrew type, I’m the first to admit I’m not some paragon of civic rectitude by any means. Neither am I a caped crusader with a black bin bag on a personal mission to Keep Britain Tidy. In all honesty, I am actually a bit of an idiot. In fact, the one time I really lost my temper with a group of litter bugs, I came to regret it for a very long time.

The flashpoint came about one day when I was out with Maxwell for a walk, this time on Clapham Common.

While Maxwell pottered about as dogs do, my gaze settled on a group of about six youths ranging from around 12 to 14 years old, who were kicking around a couple of bags of rubbish someone had placed beside an overflowing bin.

The contents were everywhere. It really was disgusting – their behaviour and the contents of the bags.

‘Guys,’ I said in what I hoped was a kind of paternal way. ‘Please don’t do that.’ What a ridiculous thing to say.

Clapham Common in London, where the presenter was spat on and subjected to a barrage of abuse

Perhaps unsurprisingly, they were deaf to my lame protestations. Then it escalated. The first volley of abuse was verbal. Shall we call it ‘the language of the newsroom’ (and then some)? As f-words rained down on me, I felt the anger welling up inside me, and an overwhelming desire to stand up to these little yobs.

Still clinging to the dog lead, I got down on my haunches and started picking the litter up, attempting to put it back in the bag. Then came the second — far more disgusting — fusillade. My first thought was: ‘Is it raining?’

It was, in fact, a monsoon of spittle accompanied by a soundtrack of guttural retching. I was covered in the stuff. I have to tell you, it was bloody awful. Down my neck, even on my face. Can you imagine anything more repulsive?

As the lads decided to leg it, I turned for home and, though it pains me to admit it — I was actually crying. Isn’t that pathetic?

When I got to my safe haven, which was about ten minutes away, I let Maxwell in and went straight upstairs and pulled my spittle-flecked clothes off. When I came out the shower, I called my wife Tina and told her what had happened. She was more than furious, just incandescent with anger. But not with the louts who’d done this to me.

No, with her husband.

She gave me the second sweary salvo I’d received that evening — albeit in a somewhat more genteel way — telling me that I was totally and utterly stupid to have intervened. ‘They could have had a knife. And then where would we all be?’

Littering stems from a lack of consideration for our fellow citizens, says radio presenter Nicky Campbell

It was a fair point, but in all honesty even after that horrible incident three years ago I would still confront yobs trashing the streets any day of the week.

Littering may seem small beer to some, but it demonstrates a blinding lack of consideration for and awareness of your fellow citizens. We see it all the time, don’t we?

We see people who can’t be bothered heaving their lazy frames just a few yards to a bin. We see it in people who tip out an ashtray from a car window, or toss a drink can out the window while they’re driving. What are they thinking? I, perhaps naively, just can’t comprehend the mindset.

So what can we do as a nation to stem this tide of litter?

The fast food outlets certainly need to do more to stop customers buying their food and drink and then just dumping the packaging wherever the hell they like.

I’d love one day to take a pile of pizza boxes back to the restaurant that handed them out and dump them over the counter.

Most of all, we need to make people realise and understand the consequences of their actions. We really are all in it together on this one.

Perhaps the social problems and solutions are too deep rooted and intractable for us to change easily, but we do have laws already that could be used more often to combat such a national problem.

It is a criminal offence for a person to drop, throw down, or otherwise deposit and then leave litter. The offence of littering is covered in Sections 87 and 88 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, and results — if it is ever prosecuted — in an average fine of around £100.

But beyond employing litter patrols — rather like the Saudi Arabian religious police — to roam around and arrest people, what do we do?

It is not my place as an impartial BBC journalist to suggest legislation, but there are some who advocate a Draconian solution who would say we need laws like the ones they have they have in Singapore, for example.

There, litter louts can be fined nearly £500 for the first conviction, and more than £2,000 for repeat offences. On top of that, you are also made to do community labour, and if you offend three times, you’ll have to wear a sign which states: ‘I am a litter lout.’

Many will undoubtedly say that is completely unreasonable, a waste of the courts’ time, and a wholly and ludicrously over the top response to a relatively minor infraction.

But do we seriously want the kind of society which has people walking round with signs telling the world they are litter louts? Although ... is that such a rubbish idea?
