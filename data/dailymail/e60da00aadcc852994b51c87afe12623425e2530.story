Whip-crack smart in a tweed jacket and tie – and with a cheery wave for well-wishers – the Duke of Edinburgh finally left hospital yesterday after heart surgery.

Only the 90-year-old royal’s slightly pallid complexion hinted at the ordeal he had been through since developing chest pains at Sandringham the day before Christmas Eve.

Still, it was hard to believe the Queen’s notoriously robust husband had undergone such an operation for a man of his age just five days earlier.

I'm fine! With a wave to reporters, Prince Philip was driven away from Papworth Hospital to rejoin the Royal Family at Sandringham

Departing from Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire shortly before 9.30am in a chauffeur-driven Range Rover, royal sources said Prince Philip was relieved to be going home but ‘immensely’ grateful for everything medical staff had done for him.

The Queen was, by all accounts, eagerly awaiting his return, having last seen him on Christmas Eve.

It didn’t take the duke long to get back in the party mood. Just hours after arriving back at the royal country retreat, he joined members of the Royal Family at a shooting party lunch. The family ate together at Wood Farm in Wolferton, which is situated on the estate and often used as an informal weekend retreat by the royals.

Prince Philip was seen sitting in the front seat of a Land Rover as he was driven away from the farmhouse at 1.45pm to return to the main house.

Meanwhile the rest of the party returned to the pheasant shoot.

In a statement Buckingham Palace said: ‘His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh was discharged from Papworth Hospital this morning. He is returning to Sandringham by car. He is very much looking forward to rejoining his family.’

On departure, Prince Philip thanked the staff at Papworth for the excellent care he has received during his stay.

Arriving at the Queen’s private estate in Norfolk, some 60 miles away, Philip again smiled and waved at bystanders.

The driver appeared to deliberately slow down to allow the elderly royal to be photographed – as if the prince wanted well-wishers to see what a remarkable recovery he had made. An estate worker said: ‘The prince could easily have arrived at a different entrance to avoid being seen, but he instead went through the normal gate where he knew he would be seen.’

Most members of the Royal Family are thought to have remained on the estate to welcome back Philip, although Viscount Linley and his wife Serena and their two children departed just ten minutes before his arrival.

A pheasant shoot also began on the 
20,000 acre estate around 15 minutes before the duke turned up. A keen 
shot even now, Philip was desperately disappointed to have missed the 
traditional shoot this year but did attend the lunch.

The Queen’s husband was airlifted to 
Papworth on Friday night after he complained of chest pains. Following 
tests, doctors discovered a blocked artery and inserted a small surgical
stent to open it up and restore the blood flow to his heart.

Although the procedure is relatively common and considered ‘minimally invasive’, doctors were taking no chances given his age and kept the prince in hospital for four nights – much to the notoriously grumpy royal’s displeasure.

The incident is the most serious health scare suffered by the duke since he was hospitalised with a serious chest infection in 2008.

Philip has always enjoyed good health and, according to those who work with him, still possesses the energy of a man half his age.

His busy public schedule sees him carrying out up to 350 official engagements each year. In the last 12 months he has also been on two gruelling foreign tours with the Queen, to Australia and Ireland, and next year is due to accompany her on a nationwide Diamond Jubilee tour.

Despite the setback he is said to be in ‘good spirits’. Aides admit, however, they cannot be sure how quickly he will resume public engagements or even whether he would attend church on Sunday as usual.
