2014 was the year of the beard, with fuzz appearing on every other man on the street. 

Any male who could grow a non-patch facial hair has considered retiring their razor on the last twelve months. 

The general public are the only ones to have caught the bug either - celebrities have been just as keen to sport some bristles on their chin.

David Beckham is the latest star to develop a mature bush on the lower half of his face, with a  dark brown rug slowly edging across his features since the beginning of February. 

But while Becks has nailed almost every look he has tried his hand at (apart from cornrows), the ex-footballer isn't well-suited to facial hair.

He isn't the only one - ultimate eye candy Brad Pitt has also failed to pull off the style, appearing more like a hobo than a rugged gent.

Other stars have taken the look on with aplomb, including Ashton Kutcher, Robert Pattinson and Callum Best. 

Read on to judge for yourselves which males celebrities look best with a beard, by sliding the arrow left or right across each picture...
