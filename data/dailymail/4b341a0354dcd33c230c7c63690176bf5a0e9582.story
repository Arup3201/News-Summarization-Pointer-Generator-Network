A man whose dog savaged an 11-month-old girl to death has admitted sending her mother a torrent of vile abuse on Snapchat after she dumped him.

Lee Christopher Wright of Blackburn, Lancashire, had been in a relationship with Chloe King, mother of Ava-Jayne Corless, who was mauled to death by the American pitbull terrier while she slept in February.

Wright and Miss King were watching television downstairs when the dog brutally savaged Ava-Jayne, and although they tried to rescue her from the jaws of the pet, she suffered horrific injuries and died in hospital.   

Lee Wright, who appeared at Blackburn Magistrates Court after admitting sending abusive messages to former girlfriend Chloe King, whose daughter Ava-Jayne Corless was mauled to death 

 Wright owned the American pitbull terrier, which mauled the 11-month-old while she slept. She suffered horrific injuries and later died in hospital 

Following the attack by Wright's dog, Miss King ended the relationship.

But today Blackburn Magistrates Court heard that Wright then sent abusive messages on Snapchat to his ex-partner telling her it was her fault baby Ava-Jayne was dead - and in one posting threatened to kill her.

By the time they reached Ava-Jayne she had suffered catastrophic injuries.

Parveen Akhtar, prosecuting, said Miss King ended the relationship after the dog attack and that from February until July, Wright had sent her numerous Snapchat messages.

Miss Akhtar said that the messages told Miss King that she was responsible for Ava-Jayne's death.

The court heard how Miss King then bumped into the defendant in August and he was very apologetic.

However, when she then started chatting with him again through the internet, he turned nasty.

Miss Akhtar explained: 'She tried to reason with him, pleading with him for it to stop but they got worse.

'He then sent Miss King a list of things he was going to do before he killed himself and then made the threat to kill her and have sex with her body.'

Paul Huxley, defending, said his client felt 'utter regret' about what his dog did in February.

'Since then he has been the subject of abuse from members of the public', said Mr Huxley.

'Miss King’s mother, Claire King, has called him a murderer in a text message.'

Ava-Jayne was 11-months-old when she was brutally savaged by the dog at Wright's home in Blackburn, Lancashire 

Ava-Jayne was sleeping while her mother and Wright watched TV downstairs when the dog savaged her 

Mr Huxley said it was a terrible situation for everyone involved.

He added: 'It wasn’t his fault the child died, that was the last thing he wanted.

'He has let the stress, which he is not sharing with anyone, bubble over.

'It has come out in comments to Chloe who is also going through a terrible time.

It has been the worst year of both of their lives to say the least.'

Wright pleaded guilty to harassing Miss King and he was remanded in custody for the preparation of a pre-sentence report.

He has also pleaded not guilty to possessing a dangerous dog and is awaiting trial at magistrates court on that matter.
