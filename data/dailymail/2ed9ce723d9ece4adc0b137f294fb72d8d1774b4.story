The captain of the Costa Concordia exclaimed, 'Let's go do this f***ing Giglio thing,' moments before crashing the cruise ship off the coast of Giglio Island, a court heard today.

The ship's navigator, Simone Canessa, testified that captain Francesco Schettino ordered him to re-set course to pass near the island in order to carry out 'the bow', a greeting to someone on the shore.

The revelation came on the day that the remains of one of the two remaining missing people from the ship were found by divers searching the submerged wreck.

The captain is on trial in the town of Grosseto over claims he acted recklessly in steering the Concordia on to the rocks and then abandoned ship in dereliction of his duties.

32 passengers died in the disaster in January last year, which occurred shortly after the ship left the port of Civitavecchia for a seven-day cruise around the western Mediterranean.

According to Gazzetta del Sud, Mr Canessa said today: 'Before leaving Civitavecchia, Commander Schettino told me to wait on the bridge.

'Then he told me to programme a modification of the route Civitiavecchia to Savona to pass next to Giglio.'

Prosecutor Alessandro Leopizzi also played the court an audio recording of the conversation between Schettino and the navigator.

'Let's go by Giglio,' the captain said. 'Let's do this bow to Giglio. Let's go do this f***ing Giglio thing.'

Mr Canessa said he did not know why Schettino wanted to do 'the bow' to Giglio, but had heard that he wanted to greet some residents of the island.

He added that in 2005, he was working on another ship which carried out 'the bow' to Giglio safely, passing just 100 metres from shore at a speed of five knots.

On that occasion, the captain of the 
ship warned all relevant authorities that he was planning to sail 
unusually close to the island.

Devastating: 32 people died when the Concordia ran aground in January last year

Today officials in charge of clearing the wreckage of the Concordia announced that they had found remains believed to belong to Russel Rebello, an Indian waiter who went missing following the disaster.

After the ship was finally pulled upright last month, divers have been able to search certain parts of the ship for the first time, allowing them to locate the body.

If the remains are confirmed to be those of Mr Rebello, the only victim whose body has not been recovered will be Italian passenger Maria Grazia Trecarichi.

Schettino faces up to 20 years in prison if he is convicted of the charges, which include manslaughter.

The trial continues.
