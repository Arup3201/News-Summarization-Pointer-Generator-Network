Captain and goalscorer Wayne Rooney admitted that England 'could have done better' after they narrowly edged out Norway at Wembley on Wednesday.

The 28-year-old scored the only goal in the uninspiring win when he struck from the penalty spot in the 69th minute.

Just 40,181 turned up to the national stadium to watch Roy Hodgson's side in the friendly match - the lowest England crowd at the new Wembley by more than eight thousand.

Following their disappointing World Cup campaign where they exited at the group stage, Rooney admitted his performance had been lacklustre.

'I thought I could have done better. We all could have done better,' Rooney told ITV1.

'It's a night, first game after the World Cup and it was important that we got the win tonight, especially going into the game on Monday.

'In the first half we moved quite well but they made it difficult for us and sat back and created a few opportunities in the first half.

'In the second half we started really sloppy and that was disappointing as we wanted to go out and really take the game to them.

'We got the win in the end and there are a lot of young players in this team and we will learn. They are still learning.'
