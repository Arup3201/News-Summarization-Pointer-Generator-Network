A 79-year-old Holocaust survivor had an emotional reunion on Wednesday with the son of the Polish family who had risked their lives some 70 years ago to hide him and his parents from the Nazis.

The emotional reunion between Leon Gersten, who moved to the U.S. after the end of the second world war and Czeslaw Polziec, 81, who went on to live under Soviet occupation and serve in the Polish army, took place in New York.

The two elderly men had last seen each other as boys aged 10 and 11 respectively in 1944, when the Russians liberated their village of Frystak.

Gersten, accompanied by his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren welcomed Polziec at JFK airport after his exhausting trans-Atlantic flight and presented him with a bouquet of flowers.

A beaming Gersten embraced and clasped the hand of a visibly moved Polziec, whose Polish parents had risked everything to save five Jews during World War II. 

‘It's like getting to know each other again,’ Gersten had told reporters earlier. ‘To me and my children they're heroes.’

Gersten, along with his mother, aunt, uncle and cousin, hid from 1942 to 1944 in the hayloft of the Polziec's farm in Nazi-occupied Poland.

Polziec recalled how he was told never to speak about their Jewish guests as their discovery would have resulted in certain death for everyone

He described his parents as honest people trying to do the right thing.

'I am very happy after 69 years of being in Poland and finally meeting my friend,' he said. 'God saved us all.'

Gersten's grandparents were amongst the Jews rounded up and killed by the Natzis in the Polish town of Frystak in July 1942.

His mother Frieda managed to escape the ghetto by disguising herself as a Catholic with a cross around her neck.

Many people turned her away when she sought someone willing to take her family in, but Maria and Stanislaw Polziec took her in, despite being poor and already having five children.

The family built an underground bunker, just big enough for the Jews and covered with a grain storage bin in the event of a raid.

They gave them a loaf of bread a week, and the Polziec children collected mushrooms in the forest to make soup.

Nazi collaborators raided the farm one day and beat Stanislaw Polziec mercilessly, but still he never betrayed their whereabouts.

After the war, Gersten emigrated to New York and the two families lost contact after his mother died.

He will now take Czeslaw home to Long Island, New York to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah together as well as Thanksgiving on Thursday.

Gersten has five children, 34 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. He got a doctorate from Columbia University.

After the army, Polziec worked in security for many years. He married and has two daughters.

The reunion was facilitated by The Jewish Foundation for the Righteous, which gives financial assistance to around 650 aged and needy Holocaust rescuers in Europe.

Six million Jews were exterminated by the Nazis during World War II. More than half of them were Polish. Gersten's father, sister and three brothers were among those who perished.
