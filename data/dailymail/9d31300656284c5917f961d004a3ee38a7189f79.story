Powerful: At just 5ft 2ins Sarah King can lift objects up to three times her own weight

A petite mother-of-two from Essex has defied the odds to become a weightlifting superstar.

Sarah King, 37, from Billericay, took up the sport seven years ago and has already broken records for lifting things three times her own body weight.

At just 5ft 2ins and tipping the scales at 9st 10lb Ms King stunned doubters by deadlifting a whopping 29st.

The busy mother-of-two juggles training with caring for her children and three jobs  - as a personal trainer, fitness instructor and PE teacher.

But powerlifting remains her passion and she has claimed a host of awards, including a gold and bronze against the world's best at the World Powerlifting Championships in Miami.

Despite her success, Ms King says people are still surprised when she tells them what she does.

'It proves you shouldn't judge a book by its cover,' she says. 'People often do a double-take when I tell them I'm a powerlifter but when they see the pictures of me on the podiums, then they believe me.

'People do label female powerlifters and assume they are really big and butch but that's not the case by any means.

'For me, it's all about exercise and keeping fit and being disciplined in training.'

Ms King, a size eight, has also broken 14 British power-lifting records despite being older than many competitors.

'At 37, I'm not the youngest woman at these contests. In fact, I'm often one of the oldest. So, combined with the fact I have only been doing this for a short while, I'm happy with the medals I've got so far.

'I always give it my all and I really enjoy competing at the highest levels but for me the main focus is about being able to enjoy a sport that helps you build confidence and self-esteem and that's what I try to teach others.'

Despite her incredible success, the size eight lifter has only been in training for seven years

At 37, Ms King is one of the oldest women to compete in the sport of powerlifting and can hoist 27 stone

She also eschewed traditional turkey and mince pies during the Christmas break in a bid to maintain her fitness. 

'When I've let myself have a break on holiday in the past it's actually turned out to be detrimental because it takes double the amount of time to get back in shape again,' she said.

'But saying that, I do try to make myself have a break now and again.

'I worked out a few nights over Christmas where I allowed myself a couple of glasses of wine. 

Beating the stereotype: Ms King says that not all female power-lifters are big and butch

Dedicated: Ms King turned down turkey and mince pies at Christmas in a bid to stay in shape

Ms King left banking to lift weights and has already broken several records and  won a host of medals

Treat: Ms King does occasionally treat herself to a glass or two of wine, including at Christmas 

'Because I so rarely drink any more, I've found two glasses of wine are more than enough for me anyway.'

Ms King's powerlifting career began seven years ago, after she gave up a high-flying career in banking to become a personal trainer. 

'I'd always been into health and fitness,' she said. 'As a youngster, I grew up playing netball, taking part in swimming galas and running marathons.

'As I got older I still carried on with them, so from that I decided to become a fitness instructor and I started spending more time at the gym.

'I found how working out with weights can have such a positive impact on the body and it all stemmed from there.'
