Play for England in the World Cup? I need to learn how to play union first!

Just as Sam Burgess’s rugby league career was about to take off with Bradford, he was forced to come to terms with the devastating news that his dad had been diagnosed with Motor Neurone disease.

Sam was 15 when his parents sat the brothers down in the conservatory at home and Mark revealed he was seriously ill. Sam had never seen him cry, so his father’s emotion that day had a profound impact.

‘Me and my older brother went off and did some research on it,’ he said. ‘We realised then that it was really serious but, as a kid of that age, I still didn’t really understand it. I didn’t know how quick it would all happen. I just figured that as time went by, he would be all right; he’d overcome it.

‘I never believed he was going to die. I thought it was a myth. I thought that people can survive cancer, so my dad would survive that. My dad was my hero so I thought he would be able to beat it, but it moved fast. It’s a terrible disease. It’s an awful thing.

‘It was happening at about the time my senior career with Bradford was starting and it was literally about 18 months to two years from when they told us the news to when he passed. It went so fast.’

While the other three brothers lived with their mum, Sam lived with his dad and nursed him through the last stage of his life — carrying him upstairs to bed each night. With his modest wages, he had to pay the mortgage and the bills.

That episode made him grow up fast. ‘I didn’t know anything else, so I didn’t feel that looking after my dad was a burden,’ he said. ‘I actually enjoyed it. It sounds strange, but we made the most of that time.

‘Going through that helped me become better at a lot of things. I learned not to take things for granted. It has made me stronger but colder, too, in a way.

‘My dad is in my thoughts every day. It was a tough part of life, but also a great part. I’ve got so many great memories of that 18 months with my dad. That’s why I can talk about it and smile. I know my dad would be proud of me.’

The 25-year-old believes the death of his father made him a stronger person
