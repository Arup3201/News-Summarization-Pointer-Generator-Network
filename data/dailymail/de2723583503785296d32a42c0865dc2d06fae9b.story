At just one week old he has already done more for giraffes than any animal before him. 

The six-foot calf, born at Dallas Zoo last Sunday, is to be named by an anonymous bidder - who has donated $50,000 to African giraffe conservation for the honor.

The 120-pound healthy male was pictured with his mother, Chrystal, last week in heartwarming photographs seen around the world.

What's in a name? The newly-born calf was pictured with his mother Chrystal at Dallas Zoo last week. An anonymous bidder will pay $50,000 to choose the calf's name 

The zoo auctioned off the naming rights on Saturday night at the 'Zoo To Do' fundraiser with bidding started at $25,000, my Fox reports.

All of the money raised is to go directly to giraffe conservation in Africa.

'Zoo To Do' is a major source of funding for the Dallas Zoological Society. 

The money is used to support education, entertainment, and wildlife conservation efforts. 

The Dallas Zoo's giraffe herd has grown to a dozen, with five females and seven males. 

 It announced the arrival of its newest member via Facebook, captioning a photograph: 'IT'S A BOY!: 

'A really leggy boy! Meet our new six-foot-tall baby giraffe born Sunday to first-time mom Chrystal. 

Growing fast: Zoo officials say the  giraffe already measures six feet tall and weighs about 120 pounds

'Mother and baby are doing great and will remain off-habitat for the next week or so.'  

Zoo keepers expect the baby giraffe will make its debut next week.

In the meantime the leggy mammal is enjoying some bonding time with his mother.
