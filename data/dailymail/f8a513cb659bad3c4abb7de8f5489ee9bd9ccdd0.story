Back in the day: Holder has repeatedly spoken publicly about his involvement in the protest but he never mentioned anything about weapons

Attorney General Eric Holder may have been armed when he and some fellow Columbia University students occupied an abandoned school office and demanded that it be rededicated to Malcolm X.

Conservative news site The Daily Caller reported that when he was a sophomore at the Ivy League school, a then-20-year-old Holder was an active member of the Student Afro-American Society who fittingly sported a similar hair style at the time.

They cite old student archives which allege that Holder and his fellow protestors were 'armed' when they took control of the then-abandoned office space that had previously been used to house the campus chapter of the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps.

Holder's involvement in the protest is undisputed, and The New York Times reported in 2009 that Holder was recruited by upperclassmen to participate in the five-day occupation.

In their report, however, the students were 'armed with pillowcases and sheets'.

The Times also contradicts the Daily Caller report, saying that Holder was a freshman and not a sophomore at the time of the occupation, and says that it took place in 1969 rather than 1970.

Holder's close college friend Steve Sims confirmed in both the New York Times article and a GQ profile that both he and Holder participated in the protest, but in neither did he mention weapons.

The Daily Caller's report does not specify what weapons they believe Holder and his compatriots held during the sit-in, but they imply that their tools were more dangerous than simply bedding.

The website credits the weapons claim to the Columbia Black Student's Organization, which has since taken over for the Student Afro-American Society. They say that on BSO website, the occupiers were 'armed' during the raid, but that portion of the BSO website is not readily available.

MailOnline contacted the Department of Justice's press office about the claims and has yet to receive a response.

Racial tensions were rife both on and off the pristine grounds of the New York campus at the time of the protest, and the student group decided to take over the unused space so that it could be rededicated as a place for students of color to meet.

In a recent biography of President Obama, who went on to study at the same university years after Holder had graduated, author David Maraniss reports that a young Mr Obama spent many hours in the Malcolm X lounge.

Even though university officials initially decried their actions as they went against the school's rules, given the circumstances, they found it appropriate to rename the space the Malcolm X Liberation Center and declined to press any punitive charges against the students involved.

The timing of this new allegation of Holder's involvement with weapons comes just one month after he was cleared of any wrong doing in the Operation Fast and Furious scandal, where one ATF officer died as a result of a failed gun trafficking plot.
