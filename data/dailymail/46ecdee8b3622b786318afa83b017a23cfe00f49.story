A message in a bottle written 54 years ago was discovered in an Arctic valley. The note may also include the last written words of a scientist who suffered a massive stroke at age 25.

The note was found under a rock cairn on Canada's Ward Hunt Island. It was written by geologist Paul T. Walker on July 10, 1959, The Los Angeles Times reports.

Walker asked that anyone who found his note would measure the distance between the cairn and a nearby glacier. He requested that the data be sent to either his Columbus, Ohio address of that of his colleague, Albert Crary in Massachusetts, The Chronicle Herald reports.

Walker's 1959 note asks that the reader measure the distance between a cairn and a glacier on Ward Hunt Island. Walker died one month after writing the note after suffering a massive brain stroke, never discovering any updates

Walker never heard from anyone regarding the distance - exactly one month after he wrote the note, he became paralyzed by a brain seizure, CBC News reports.

A bush pilot rescued Walker and he eventually returned to his parents' home in California, The Los Angeles Times reports. He died November 11, 1959 at age 25.

Walker's note was found after a Warwick Vincent, a Laval University biologist, and his team were exploring the edge of a glacier on Ward Hunt Island, according to The Chronicle Herald.

'For me, it was an incredible thing to hold this in my hands, because these two people, these are very famous names,' Vincent said to the paper.

The highest point on Ward Hunt Island is named Walker Hill after the geologist, The Los Angeles Times reports. Crary travelled to both the North and South Poles. The U.S. Arctic Program's Science and Engineering Center in Antarctica is named after him.

The 1.2-metre gap between the cairn and the glacier in 1959 is now 101.5 meters today, The Chronicle Herald reports.

The Herald adds that Vincent left Walker's 1959 note in the cairn. Vincent left a new note of his, asking that whoever finds it measure the distance again -- and this time, send it to Quebec City.

Jim Lotz, a friend of Walker, 
described his friend's life to The Los Angeles Times. Before his trip to Ward 
Hunt Island, Walker already drove to Alaska and travelled to Antarctica.

'He was such a great guy,' Lotz said. 'He was free and easy. The best of California culture.'
