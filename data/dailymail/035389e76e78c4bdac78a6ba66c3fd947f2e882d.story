Pakistan say they will execute around 500 militants in the coming weeks after its government lifted a moratorium on the death penalty in terror cases following last week's school massacre.

Six militants have been hanged since Friday amid rising public anger over Tuesday's slaughter in the northwestern city of Peshawar, which left 149 people dead including 133 children.

Meanwhile police say they have arrested six men and one woman who 'helped facilitate' the Taliban slaughter - and who were planning another.

After the deadliest terror attack in Pakistani history, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif reinstated the death penalty for terrorism-related cases.

A senior government official told AFP: 'Interior ministry has finalised the cases of 500 convicts who have exhausted all the appeals, their mercy petitions have been turned down by the president and their executions will take place in coming weeks.' 

Of the six hanged so far, five were involved in a failed attempt to assassinate then military ruler Pervez Musharraf in 2003, while one was involved in a 2009 attack on army headquarters.

Police, troops and paramilitary rangers have been deployed across the country and airports and prisons put on red alert during the executions and as troops intensify operations against Taliban militants.

Sharif has ordered the attorney general's office to 'actively pursue' capital cases currently in the courts, a government spokesman said.

The 'prime minister has also issued directions for appropriate measures for early disposal of pending cases related to terrorism,' the spokesman said, without specifically confirming the plan to execute 500 people.

Pakistan has described Tuesday's bloody school rampage, claimed by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), as its own 'mini 9/11,' calling it a game-changer in the fight against extremism.

On the latest arrests, the Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan told reporters: 'A few suspects who were facilitators in one way or another have been taken into custody,' the International Business Times reports.

'We are receiving intelligence from across the country that the militants are getting ready for another savage and inhuman counter-attack.'

News of the arrests comes a few days after the mastermind behind the school massacre was identified as 36-year-old Umar Mansoor.

In a direct video message, the mass murderer nicknamed 'slim' and described as 'the most hated – and dangerous' man in Pakistan, said: 'I want to tell the Pakistan government, and the directors, teachers and students of the army's affiliated institutions, that you are the ones strengthening this un-Islamic democratic system.

'It is these institutions that graduate future generals, brigadiers and majors, who then kill Taliban and innocent tribal people. 

'If our women and children die as martyrs, your children will not escape. We will fight against you in such a style that you attack us and we will take revenge on innocents.'

The offensive against longstanding Taliban and other militant strongholds in North Waziristan and Khyber tribal agencies has been going on since June.

But a series of fresh strikes since the Peshawar attack, in which dozens of alleged militants were killed, suggest the campaign is being stepped up.

The decision to reinstate executions was condemned by human rights groups, with the United Nations also calling for Pakistan to reconsider.

Human Rights Watch on Saturday said the executions were 'a craven politicised reaction to the Peshawar killings' and demanded no further hangings be carried out.

Pakistan began its de facto moratorium on civilian executions in 2008, but hanging remains on the statute books and judges continue to pass death sentences.

Before Friday's resumption, only one person had been executed since 2008 -- a soldier convicted by a court martial and hanged in November 2012.

Rights campaigners say Pakistan overuses its anti-terror laws and courts to prosecute ordinary crimes.
