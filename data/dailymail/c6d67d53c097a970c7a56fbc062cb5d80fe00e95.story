CNN host Piers Morgan has said he believes the Bible and the U.S. Constitution are 'inherently flawed' and that the Bible needs an amendment changing its stance on same-sex marriage.

The bold statements come days after the British journalist divided America with his strict stance on gun laws following the Sandy Hook massacre, even sparking e-petitions to deport him.

While interviewing Pastor Rick Warren on his CNN show, he said: 'Both the Bible and the Constitution were well intentioned but they are basically, inherently flawed. Hence, the need to amend it.'

Warren, who is against same-sex marriage replied: 'Not a chance. What I believe is flawed is human opinion, because it constantly changes.'

Outspoken: In an interview with Pastor Rick Warren, Piers Morgan called the Bible 'flawed'

Opinionated: He said that the Bible should be amended to change its stance on gay rights

'But you and I know the Bible is, in many places, a flawed document,' 
Morgan continued. 'My point to you about gay rights for example - it's 
time for an amendment to the Bible. You should compile a new Bible.'

With Warren responding that he believes that the Bible reveals the truth - and the truth is never outdated - Morgan quipped: 'Weâ€™re going to agree to disagree on that.'

His remarks sparked anger among conservatives, including Paul Kengor, the executive director of The Center for Vision and Values at Grove City College.

'It's remarkable to watch secular liberals like Piers Morgan assume unto themselves the extraordinary authority to divine what in the Bible is true and what is not, what is flawed and what is not, and where certain "amendments" supposedly need to occur,' he told Fox News.

Movement: It comes after he upset Americans with his stance on guns, sparking petitions to deport him

Now a second petition on the White House website now insists he must stay in the US, not only because he has a constitutional right to free speech but also 'more important' because 'no one in the UK wants him back'

It is just the latest of Morgan's outspoken opinions to be spotlighted after he offended thousands of Americans with his anti-gun remarks.

He has demanded tighter U.S. gun laws following the Sandy Hook massacre and last week on Piers Morgan Tonight, he interviewed a gun advocate and called him an 'unbelievably stupid man'.

On December 21, a man in Texas launched a petition on the White House e-petition website demanding Morgan be deported immediately for 'exploiting his position as a national network television host to stage attacks against the rights of American citizens'.

The petition accuses Morgan of engaging in a 'hostile attack against the U.S. Constitution' by targeting the Second Amendment - the right to bear arms.

Anger: People took to Twitter to lambast his latest remarks, adding to the voices who want him deported

It has already garnered more than 84,000 signatures - far exceeding the 25,000 signature threshold required to get a White House response.

But Morgan seemed unfazed by the effort to oust him.

In a series of Twitter messages, he urged his followers to sign the petition and in response to one article about the petition even said: 'Bring it on'.

He wrote: 'If I do get deported from America for wanting fewer gun murders, are there any other countries that will have me?'

But a second petition on the same 
website now insists he must stay in the US, not only because he has a 
constitutional right to free speech but also - 'more important' - 
because 'no one in the UK wants him back'.

Response: The White House defended the freedom of speech and the press on Wednesday in a long-awaited response to an online petition to deport CNN host Piers Morgan over his views on gun control

Hundreds have signed the 'Keep Piers Morgan in the USA' petition after it was proposed by Janusz Jasinski, a Birmingham-based website designer.

To add to the former newspaper editor's embarrassment, a third petition is calling on Home Secretary Theresa May to stop him from returning to Britain.

Appearing on the US website Change.org it has so far attracted more than 100 signatures and states: 'We got rid of him once and why should we have to suffer again. The Americans wanted him so they should put up with him.'
