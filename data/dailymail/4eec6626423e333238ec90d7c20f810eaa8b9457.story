'Ointment': David Acres, 36, denied he was performing a sex act on himself

A man who exposed himself to a coach load of schoolgirls while driving along a motorway claimed he was applying ointment to his genitals, a court heard.

David Acres, 36, denied he was performing a sex act on himself as he drove past the shocked pupils along the M6 motorway near Rugby, Warwickshire.

Acres, 36, was seen with his hand moving 'furiously' on his genitals by the schoolgirls and their teacher, it was said.

But he told Warwick Crown Court he was simply rubbing ointment on himself at the time.

A statement from Acres' wife said he had had a problem with a sore genital area for some time but had not been to a doctor about it.

Acres, of Irthlingborough, Northamptonshire, denied indecently exposing his genitals intending someone to see them and be caused alarm or distress in March 2011.

But on the day of his trial at Warwick Crown Court he pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of outraging public decency by his actions.

Denis Desmond, prosecuting, said: 'The Crown were not minded to pursue the allegation that he did it intending the children on the coach to see what he was doing.'

However, the prosecution said they did not accept Acres' claim that he was not performing a sex act at the time as the teacher said he had been performing the act 'furiously'.

Judge Alan Parker said: 'His case is that he was applying ointment while driving in his car on the M6 motorway.

'The risk assessment that follows needs to be based on either a finding that he was merely applying ointment to himself and gave no thought to the young girls on the coach seeing him, or that he was performing a sexual act; because if he was, it makes it more likely he will do the same in the future.'

The case was adjourned for a 'trial of issue' at which the teacher, but not the girls, will be called to give evidence, and Acres was granted bail.
