Three iconic World War Two posters which never made it into production because it was feared their messages might be taken too literally, have been revealed. 

The never-before-seen images, which depict Adolf Hitler, Nazi spin doctor Joseph Goebbels and Luftwaffe chief Hermann Goering in bold colours with messages beneath urging Brits to help the enemies by taking time off and spreading gossip, sold for £1,000 at auction.

It is believed the designs were blocked from print because Brits might not have recognised the enemy leaders and and might have taken the messages at face value.

Other highlights in the collection of 150 posters, which sold for almost £20,000 at auction, included a copy of artist Abram Games' 'Blonde Bombshell' poster which was controversially withdrawn from circulation because it was deemed too glamorous.

It featured an alluring blonde with bright red lipstick, provoking fierce dispute over whether it was the right way to recruit women into the Army's dowdy Auxiliary Territorial Service.

It was so contentious that Conservative MP Thelma Cazalet condemned it in Parliament.

Because very few copies of it were made, it is among the most rare WWII posters to collect - and this one was sold for £1,200.

The collection also features work by well-known artists like Kenneth Cyril Bird and Frank Wootton as well as posters by unknown designers.

It was sold by the family of Ernest Bendell-Bayly, a commercial artist who ran a design studio in London's Fleet Street producing posters for the war effort.

Mr Bendell-Bayly was a partner of the Bayly-Souster Group and kept copies of many of the posters the studio produced, whether they made it into circulation or not.

The posters were sold in 91 separate lots at Penzance Auction House in Cornwall.

Experts had tipped the archive to fetch £10,000 but the final total was £18,995.

Mimi Connell-Lay, from the auction house, said: 'These WWII recruiting posters belonged to Ernest Bendell-Bayly, owner of a London design studio that made the posters.

'Mr Bendell-Bayly kept a lot of them and they have passed down to his family.

'Probably the most rare poster in the collection was the 'Blonde Bombshell' ATS poster by Abram Games which was controversially withdrawn for glamorising army life.

'Very few have survived so it is very rare, and the sale price reflects that.

'We can't find any evidence of the the Hitler, Goebbels and Goering designs ever being printed.

'It may be that they were too obscure and that at a time before television the British public didn't know what Goerring and Goebbels looked like.

'Perhaps the message was a bit too ambiguous, or perhaps they thought people might take an instruction to 'Take time off! too literally.

'On many levels the posters act as historical documents.

'The prices they sold for just goes to show the interest there is in the war - not bad for a load of old posters that were given away free in their day.'
