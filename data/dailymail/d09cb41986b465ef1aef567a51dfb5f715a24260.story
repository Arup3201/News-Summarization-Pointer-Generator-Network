Turkish holiday: Sandra Bainbridge, with Derek Joyner, was stabbed more than 70 times at her home in Derbyshire by Andrea Cutler

A grandmother was stabbed to death by a schizophrenic drug addict who broke into her home while she was on holiday.

Sandra Bainbridge, 70, returned from Turkey to find Andrea Cutler had taken over her 18th century listed cottage and assumed her identity.

The intruder stabbed her 73 times and left her body under a duvet in the back yard. Mrs Bainbridge’s lover and holiday companion almost suffered the same fate when he turned up 24 hours later.

Following a trail of blood upstairs Derek Joyner ran into Cutler holding a knife. After a struggle the 70-year-old grandfather of four fled and called police.

But Mr Joyner was himself briefly put under arrest when police arrived and found no sign of Cutler. The 39-year-old had stolen her victim’s Nissan Pixo and was detained when the vehicle triggered a number plate camera the next day.

Last night Mr Joyner described his encounter with Cutler as like ‘being in a horror film without the music’.

‘I remember the light from the room catching the eight-inch blade,’ he told the Mail. ‘I just slammed the door and held the handle.

‘She grabbed the handle from the other side and I could feel her getting the better of me and forcing the handle down.

‘I realised right there and then that I was fighting for my life and that I could not let go of that handle.

‘The narrow staircase represented the only way out and as I felt her grip weaken slightly I made up my mind to go for it.

‘I just kept picturing that knife being plunged through my back.’

The pair grappled in the porch before Cutler broke away, allowing Mr Joyner to escape. 

Detectives discovered that Cutler had adopted Mrs Bainbridge’s identity after forcing her way into the cottage five days earlier. She changed her home phone number and credit card PIN which she was able to use to buy a pair of shoes, a handbag and provisions.

Nottingham Crown Court heard that Cutler had a long history of mental illness but was free to wander the streets despite being delusional and psychotic.

Her mental health began to deteriorate after she started taking cannabis at the age of 15. She moved on to heroin, amphetamines, crack cocaine and ecstasy and both her children were taken into care.

Sean Smith QC, prosecuting, said Cutler first developed mood swings in 1993 and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in 1994. She threatened to kill her adoptive parents at least twice and was sectioned in 2005.

Guilty: Cutler, pictured, stabbed Sandra Bainbridge 73 times in the attack. She had a history of mental illness

In the year leading up to the attack, Cutler had repeatedly failed to attend medical appointments and refused to take mood stabilising drugs and other medication.

In September 2013 she started a hate campaign against Amelia Horne, a former school friend who owned a café in Derby. She was cautioned for threatening to kill her and was then charged after she made further visits to the cafe.

Cutler failed to show up at court in December and a warrant was issued for her arrest.

She had left her Derby home however and slept rough in nearby Belper the night before she broke in to Mrs Bainbridge’s home. Cutler admitted manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility and was given an indefinite hospital custody order. 

She had been charged with murder until doctors concluded she was suffering from schizo-affective psychosis.

Kajal Patel, a psychiatrist who sits on the medical parole board, told Judge Gregory Dickinson QC that Cutler’s history suggested the crime ‘happened largely because she was not complying with her treatment’.

Derbyshire Healthcare Trust said staff had made ‘great efforts to try and engage’ with Cutler. It is taking part in an independent homicide inquiry into the case.

Mr Joyner, a retired educationalist, met mother-of-three and former civil servant Mrs Bainbridge at a real ale tasting session in 2009. 

The two divorcees had planned to fly to Mexico for a ‘trip of a lifetime’ last January but the departure date turned out to be Mrs Bainbridge’s funeral. 

Judge Dickinson said her life had been ‘cut short in the most brutal and shocking’ manner by a ‘feckless, self-centred woman driven only by a desire for drugs’.

The judge said Cutler had gone to ground because she realised a warrant would be issued for her arrest. He described the attack as ‘degrading’ and said Mrs Bainbridge was afforded no dignity in death.

Of the 73 stab wounds, more than 40 were around the head, face and neck. But Mrs Bainbridge also suffered 13 stab wounds between her legs, possibly after death.

In a statement outside court, Mrs Bainbridge’s family said Cutler was ‘aware that she needed to take medication, but refused to do so’.

They added: ‘She chose a life of drug taking and crime and rejected the treatment, help and support she was offered. Her conscious choices made her into what she is – a merciless and vicious killer.

‘It is presently unclear whether action could have been taken to prevent what she did to Sandra Bainbridge. The authorities must now ensure that she is never at liberty to kill again.’ 

'Sandra Bainbridge was a vibrant, fit person who loved life. She was adventurous, active and full of fun. A marvellous and unique person has been taken from her family and friends.

'They also have to live with the horrific knowledge of what she went through at the hands of Andrea Cutler.

'Andrea Cutler is completely responsible for the terrible crime she committed. She was aware that she needed to take medication, but refused to do so. She chose a life of drug taking and crime and rejected the treatment, help and support she was offered.

'Her conscious choices made her into what she is - a merciless and vicious killer. Her actions were not those of a person lashing out in fear, or even in anger. She was calculating and calm when planning and executing her crimes.

'She stabbed an innocent person 73 times and deliberately and horribly mutilated her.

It is purely by chance that she did not kill others. Andrea Cutler is, and will remain, a cruel, unstable and very dangerous person.

'She has shown no remorse and no emotion when the details of her crime have been described in court. It is presently unclear whether action could have been taken to prevent what she did to Sandra Bainbridge.

'The authorities must now ensure that she is never at liberty to kill again.'
