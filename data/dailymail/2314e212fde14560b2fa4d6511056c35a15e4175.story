Vandals have graffitied hate-filled messages on an Indonesian community mosque. 

The words 'die' and 'Muslims are evil and have no respect for our ways' were spray-painted on the mosque in southern Brisbane - the second Muslim prayer site to be defaced in Queensland in less than a week. 

Muslim community leaders and police were alerted to the vandalism at the Rocklea mosque on Wednesday evening and a police forensic team has begun an investigation.

Vandals graffitied hate-filled messages on an Indonesian community mosque in Rocklea in Brisbane

Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart called for calm and tolerance in response to growing concerns over the threat posed by the terrorist group Islamic State

A mosque spokesman said the community was saddened by the attack but that it would clean up the mess and move on.

'This is a sad day not just for our community but for all Australians,' spokesman Febi Dwirahmadi said. 

'This abhorrent act is not representing the real Australian. We call for all communities to calm down.

'We will not be destroyed by this. It makes us more resilient. We are all Australians and we must all come together and call for calm right across the globe.' 

Islamic Indonesian Community of Queensland president Hamid Mawardi praised police for their quick response to the attack on the Rocklea mosque, the ABC reported.

Mr Mawardi said he had no idea who had vandalised the mosque but that it was 'probably just kids'.

'I think this is a misperception about Islam – we are here, Australian,' he said.

'I've been here for years and we live nice and peacefully and whoever did this – respect us as Australians.' 

The latest incident comes just five days after a mosque at Mareeba in far north Queensland was vandalised with the word 'evil' spray-painted across it on Friday

Mareeba mayor Tom Gilmore told AAP the prayer site had been part of the area since the 1950s and the Muslim members were a 'highly respected' part of the community.

The attack on the mosque did not reflect the attitudes of the wider community, he added.

On Wednesday afternoon, Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart called for calm and tolerance in response to growing concerns over the threat posed by the terrorist group Islamic State.

He was speaking after an incident in Melbourne on Tuesday night where a man who was under investigation was shot dead by police in Melbourne, and after a number of counter-terrorism raids occurred in Sydney and south of Brisbane in recent weeks.

Mr Stewart said he had met with leaders in the Brisbane Muslim community and told them police would go out of their way to ensure their safety, the ABC reported.

'Whilst it is our strong view that this [terrorism] is not religiously based or culturally based, the perception may be in some quarters that the Muslim community have some ties to the perpetrators of some of these crimes,' he said.

'They are simply people who have no respect for any of us or for any particular religion or religious group.'

He said police would be hiring four more Muslim police liaison officers to help improve communication with the community.
