West Ham want to take Chelsea winger Christian Atsu on loan.

The 22-year-old, who featured for Ghana in the World Cup, was signed from Porto last year but loaned out to Vitesse Arnhem. Aston Villa are also interested.

Meanwhile, West Ham have bid £12million for Ecuador's Enner Valencia but look like missing out on Yehven Konoplyanka of Dnipro.

Options: Chelsea youngster Christian Atsu is a target for West Ham and Aston Villa

Unlikely: West Ham's bid to sign Yevhen Konoplyanka from Dnipro look to have ground to a halt
