Thousands 
of Arsenal fans flooded the streets of north London to celebrate their 
side's dramatic FA Cup victory, that ended a nine-year wait for 
silverware.

Match
 winner Aaron Ramsey was pinching himself on Sunday morning as the 
realisation of ending Arsenal's trophy drought dawned on 
him.

The
 Welsh midfielder tweeted: 'Woke up and it turns out it really did happen. Thanks for all the tweets, see you later at the parade!!'

The Gaffer: Arsene Wenger (R) raises the trophy that might have decided his decision to stay at the club

The
 players were taken in red double decker buses that left from the 
Emirates Stadium at 11:00am and travelled to Islington Town Hall, Upper Street.

There they
 attended a short reception with local dignitaries before re-boarding 
the bus and heading back to the stadium, waving to fans as they basked 
in the May sunshine.

Back
 at the Emirates the players, manager and other club officials took to a
 plinth above The Armoury store where they greeted waiting supporters, 
lifting the cup to an almighty cheer.

There
 was a party atmosphere as red and white confetti rained down on club 
captain Thomas Vermaelen and his teammates, and the normally reserved 
Arsene Wenger raised his arms in celebration.

During the bus celebrations, all the players got into the swing of things - especially England international Jack Wilshere who took the opportunity to win fans' affection while simultaneously mocking the club's local rivals with an impromptu piece of Tottenham goading.

Wilshere also spoke to Sky Sports TV cameras, saying: 'It's hard to find the words, we waited a long time for this, we waited nine years.

'We failed a few years ago in the Carling Cup, we all felt that.'

'We had a tough run in the FA Cup, so you can't say we didn't deserve it.'

Meanwhile, Theo Walcott - who was sidelined for the final through injury - led fans in a chorus of 'Bacary Sagna we want you to stay', as a last ditch effort to convince the France defender not to leave the club as is widely expected (see above).

German defender Per Mertesacker also endeared himself to the crowd by breaking out an energetic version of the song 'Arsenal till I die!' (see below).

Kieran Gibbs was taken aback by the number of supporters who turned up to share the celebrations.

'It's something very special, I can't believe how many people are here, this just reiterates how big the club is.

'Now we've got the first hurdle out the way, hopefully it will give us a boost for the season to come.

'To be honest, we showed character for the last couple of years, but yesterday was a testament to the players.'

Stand up if you love Arsenal! Supporters show their appreciation for finally bringing hokme some silverware

It has been estimated that up to 250,000 people arrived to witness the parade - giving local businesses and opportunistic vendors a chance to take advantage of some extra custom.

One seller was seen offering bright red T-shirts with 'Arsenal 3 Hull 2' emblazoned across a mocked-up Wembley Stadium?

'Printed them through the night, got the names of the scorers on and everything,' he told a Press Association reporter.

'A tenner if you want, or two for £15.'

However, the victory parade almost never happened after Arsene Wenger's side were stunned by two
 quickfire goals from Hull City within the first ten minutes at Wembley. But, they courageously fought back to equalise through Santi Cazorla and Laurent 
Koscielny - forcing the game into extra-time.

With
 the dreaded prospect of penalties drawing closer, it was Ramsey who 
scored the winner in the 19th minute of extra-time to avert what would 
have been a disastrous end to a season that promised so much at the beginning.

The 23-year-old has been a revelation this campaign, scoring 10 league goals, before injury kept him sidelined for three months. Had he remained fit, Arsenal's title challenge may not have petered out towards the end of the season.

Arsenal's new strip! A champagne drenched Arsene Wenger confirmed he would sign a new contract

After completing the greatest FA Cup final comeback since 1966, a champagne drenched Wenger confirmed that he would would sign a new contract to extend his 18-year reign at the club.

‘This
 should normally happen — and we are in very normal circumstances,’ he 
smiled as he toasted his record-equalling fifth FA Cup triumph. ‘It was 
never a question of leaving, only doing what is right for this club.’

It
was the manager’s 512th game since his last trophy in 2005 and England 
manager Roy Hodgson will hope the comeback is an omen. The last time a 
similar FA Cup final recovery occurred, when  Everton beat Sheffield 
Wednesday, Bobby Moore went on to lift the World Cup.
