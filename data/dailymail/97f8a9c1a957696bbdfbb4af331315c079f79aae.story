A British climber has angered the Nepalese government by giving an 'illegal' interview to the BBC on his smartphone from the top of Mount Everest.

It was the first time a video call has been made from the summit of the mountain, but explorer Daniel Hughes' joy was tempered by the fury of the government.

Anyone making a call for 'media' purposes from the top of the world's highest mountain has to have permission from the government, which he didn't have.

Daniel Hughes prepares to speak to the BBC on Mount Everest in what has been branded an illegal interview with the Nepalese government

Mr Hughes is to receive a rebuke from government officials when he returns to the capital, Kathmandu

The situation was made worse by the fact he was wearing a clown's red nose for charity.

When word of the interview got out, the government said it would be speaking to Mr Hughes 
when he returned to the capital, Kathmandu.

'Mr
Hughes has broken the law by not seeking permission from the 
communication ministry to film, broadcast or conduct media related 
events on Everest,' said Mr Purnachandra Bhattarai, joint secretary of 
Nepal's tourism Ministry.

Mr Hughes was joyful when he made contact with the BBC. 'This is the world's first live video call,' he said, breathing heavily through an oxygen mask.

'Never been done before.'

He had become the first person to make a video call atop Everest

Putting in a plug for the Android phone he used, he said: 'I had to share this not only because the HTC One is the phone I use, but just imagine what will be available in the future.

'I don't have a cameraman with me - it's me and a pole and an HTC smart phone and an Inmarsat modem.'

He pointed out that he had to use a stylus to work the phone because if he took his gloves off his fingers would fall off with the cold.

The trekking agency he used was also in deep trouble.

Mr Bhattarai said the agency had been placed 'under investigation', but he did not give further details.

Nor has it been revealed what the government plans to do with Mr Hughes when he returns to Kathmandu.

Mr Hughes was among 146 people who reached the summit on Sunday during what was called a 'fair weather' window.

Records were claimed at the time by the first women from Saudi Arabia and Pakistan to reach the top and Indian sisters became the first twins to make the ascent.

Climbs to aid charities have become increasingly popular on Everest, but the mountain has also attracted people from around the world who simply want to make the ascent.

Last year, more than 250 climbers reached the summit in a 48-hour stretch of good weather.

But there have also been incidents between climbers and Sherpas, the most dramatic coming last month when a British climber and two Europeans became involved in a fist fight with their Sherpas close to the peak.

Mr Hughes reached the summit with 146 other people yesterday and was keen to the world about his achievements

This climbing season marks the 60th anniversary of Edmund Hillary's and Tenzing Norgay's maiden summit.

Commenting on Mr Hughes' broadcast and the earlier fight, Mr Bhattarai said: 'This summit season has already been marked by controversy and we don't want it to happen again.'

Mr Hughes has been trying to raise Â£1 million for Comic Relief.
