Two people have been charged over the abduction of a two-year-old girl from her home in Queensland on Saturday

Two people have been charged after a two-year-old girl was abducted from a Queensland home on Saturday night.

A 21-year-old Queensland woman and 42-year-old Victorian man were charged with the abduction, as well as burglary and indictable offences.

They are due to appear in the Ipswich Magistrates Court today.

The girl was returned to her father after a state-wide search over the weekend.

The girl's fatherÂ  thanked people for their help finding his daughter, telling Nine News: 'I'm just glad she's back. She could've been anywhere, as long as she was safe.'

The toddler was taken around 7.15pm on Saturday after three men allegedly burst into a home in suburban Willowbank, outside Ipswich in Queensland.

The girl's father said he struggled to try rescue his daughter but could not break free from the 'big guy' who had him restrained.

He told The Courier Mail: 'I just tried to reach for her, but the big guy pushed me back against wall.'

He told police that, as they left, he had his face 'smashed' in.

'They just basically busted in, took the little child, and as I went to walk out the door they smashed me across the face,' he said.

It is understood there were other children in the home at the time, who witnessed the abduction.

A white Holden Commodore and a silver Mitsubishi sedan were seen driving slowly along Sancroft Street where the girl was taken.

A neighbour said he saw the one of the cars but heard nothing from the house at the time the girl was taken.

Another resident, Melissa Bolt, also said she heard no noise come from the house.

'It must have happened very quickly,' Mrs Bolt said.

A statewide search was initiated after the girl's father said that three men burst into his house, pinned him against the wall and abducted his daughter on Saturday
