Jonathan Glanz says that some social housing tenants in London enjoy a Made In Chelsea lifestyle

Social housing tenants living in affluent areas of London are enjoying a 'Made In Chelsea' lifestyle according to a Westminster councillor.

Jonathan Glanz, a Conservative cabinet member for housing at Westminster Council said that subsided properties in London mean that social housing tenants can enjoy living in multi-million pound homes at the taxpayers' expense.

Comparing the tenants' lifestyles to those enjoyed by the cast of Channel 4 reality show, Mr Glanz told the Daily Telegraph: 'Trust funds are often associated with the Made In Chelsea brigade, the young people portrayed in the ITV (sic) television series who spend their days dining out and sipping champagne.

'It may be a stretch, but in some way, their fortunes are not entirely dissimilar to some of the benefits enjoyed by social housing tenants in some of the country's most expensive areas.

'We some social housing properties in Westminster and other central London boroughs valued at upwards of £2million, a heavily subsidised rent on a two or three bedroom house a stone's throw from Oxford Street might otherwise only be affordable to a  so-called trustafarian.'

But Soho resident Alida Baxter told the Telegraph that Mr Glanz's comments seemed to herald a campaign to get anyone out of London who wasn't rich.

She told the newspaper: 'He seems to want to make a gated community of central London and he has said so often about the fact that this isn't the place where ordinary people should live or can live.'

The row comes following Work and Pensions Secretary Ian Duncan Smith's introduction of a cap on housing benefit in June.

And the introduction of the bedroom tax, which means that tenants with spare bedrooms must downsize, or pay extra rent.
