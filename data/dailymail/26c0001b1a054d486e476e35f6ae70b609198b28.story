Plans to create a block of privately owned apartments on the site of the Gleneagles Hotel in Asheldon Road, Torquay, Devon have gone out to public consultation ahead of a planning application.

The hotel and its former owner in the 1960s were reportedly the inspiration behind John Cleese's incredibly popular TV sitcom Fawlty Towers.

The show is still being broadcast around the globe and continues to raise the profile of Torquay and has even been voted the top BBC sitcom by foreign viewers.

The antics of the madcap, zany hotelier, his bumbling Spanish waiter and his officious wife were said to have been inspired by a visit of the Monty Python team to the English Riviera for filming.

This week local people were given a chance to view and discuss plans for a specialist development of apartments with a consultation event.

Retirement property developers Churchill Retirement Living are preparing a planning application for what it says will be a high quality, purpose-built development.

Plans to create a block of 39 privately owned apartments on the hotel site have been released

They propose one and two-bedroom apartments, for those aged 60 and above, a communal owners' lounge, a guest suite and a lodge manager's office.

Andrew Burgess, planning director at Churchill Retirement Living, said: 'We place great importance on engaging with local communities during the planning process and providing them with an opportunity to have their say on our early stage plans.

'We believe our proposals for this brownfield site will significantly enhance the local area and provide much-needed specialist housing for older people.

'Not only do our developments offer security, peace of mind and independence for residents, they in turn free up larger, family homes for local people.

'This scheme would be built using high-quality materials to a traditional design to ensure it is in keeping with the character of the area.

'If the development goes ahead, investment will also be made by Churchill Retirement Living towards local services and facilities such as public open space and off site affordable housing.'
