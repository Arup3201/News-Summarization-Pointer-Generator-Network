The majority of slang used in America today originates in cities with large African American populations, it has been suggested.

A study of language used on Twitter found that popular terms begin in specific urban areas are the ones that then spread more widely.

It confirms the long-held view that African-American slang - with words such as cool and dig - has a strong influence on the rest of the population.

A study of around 40million tweets provides valuable insight into the use of local slang terms across the U.S., explaining how terms such as 'bruh' and the emoticon '-_-' can spread from region to region over time.

Jacob Eisenstein at the Georgia 
Institute of Technology in Atlanta and his colleagues examined millions 
of tweets sent from locations in the U.S. between December 2009 and May 
2011 to find out where commonly used slang words were originating and 
how they were migrating to other parts of the country.

They found that certain regions, such as
Atlanta, Southern California and New York, are hotbeds for new slang 
terms, and that those cities often share and exchange slang words.

'Bruh,' for example, originated in the Southeast and eventually jumped 
to Southern California.

The emoticon '-_-', implying indifference or mild annoyance, began in New York and Florida before leaping to Arizona and Texas.

And more often than not, New Yorker tend to type 'nuttin' in place of 'nothing.'

Residents of Cleveland, Ohio, were the first to use "ctfu", an abbreviation of "cracking the fuck up", usage that has since spread into Pennsylvania, the New Scientist reported.

They collected around 40million messages from around 400,000 individuals between June 2009 and May 2011 that could be tied to a particular geographical location in the USA because of the smartphone metadata optionally included with the message.

After collecting the data, the team built a mathematical model that captures the large-scale flow of new words between cities.The model revealed that cities with big African American populations tend to lead the way in linguistic innovation.

Eisenstein and his colleagues are tracing the origins and spread of colloquialisms to understand better understand how Twitter is affecting written language.

As part of their research, they have produced a map illustrating the migration of language trends and how different regions affect one another.

They are also trying to determine how and why certain words catch on and become trendy whereas others never leave the cities of their origin.Â 

The researchers are hoping to present their preliminary findings at a workshop on Social Network and Social Media Analysis in December organised by the Neural Information Processing Systems Foundation.

However, one expert suggested that the results don't necessarily reflect the wider population as Twitter has a higher rate of adoption among African Americans than other ethnic groups.
