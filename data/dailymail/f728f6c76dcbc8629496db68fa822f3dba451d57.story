To many of us, Jennifer Aniston's iconic layered haircut in her role as Rachel Green on Friends is now synonymous with Nineties style - unless, of course, you're too young to to remember the show.

That's exactly what 22-year-old singer Sky Ferreira realized after she shared a photo of herself with fans on Instagram, showing off her new haircut that resembled the character's famous 'do.

But when she captioned the image 'The Rachel is Real', her young fans were left positively bewildered, with some leaving hilarious comments asking who in the world Rachel is.

Get the reference? Singer Sky Ferreira shared a photo of her new 'The Rachel' haircut on Instagram (pictured), butshe was left feeling old when her young fans had no idea who she was talking about

Confused identity: Many of her 326,000-plus followers were left positively bewildered, with some leaving hilarious comments asking who in the world Rachel is

'Who the f*** is she????' wrote one of her fans. 'Who is rachel?' demanded another.

And perhaps the most hilarious response came from one of Sky's fans who seemed convinced she had solved the mystery. 'She means ratchet, d******,' she wrote confidently.

Even Miley Cyrus's younger sister Noah, 14, was left bewildered by the reference. In another post, Sky shared a screenshot of a text sent to her from We Can't Stop singer. 

The screenshot shows how Miley texted the haircut photo to her sibling, and she responded: 'Who is rachel?'

Iconic: Jennifer Aniston became so well known for her layered chop in her role as Rachel Green on Friends that the cut quickly came to be known as The Rachel

Generation gap: Clearly Sky's fanbase is too young to remember the show, which aired its final episode in 2004

Cracked it: Perhaps the most hilarious response came from one of Sky's fans who seemed convinced she had solved the mystery. 'She means ratchet, d******,' she wrote

The final episode of Friends aired in 2004, when Noah was just four years old, so his confusion is somewhat understandable.

Still, for twenty-somethings who watched the series from start to finish and who can still quote episodes, the incident is undoubtedly a sad reminder of just how quickly time passes.

Sky captioned the photo of the text conversation: 'Call me grandma,' expressing how old the responses made her feel.

Not a clue: Even Miley Cyrus's younger sister Noah, 14, was left bewildered by the reference

Sky and Miley Cyrus are currently on tour together, along with Icona Pop and Lily Allen.

The pair struck up a friendship in 2013 and have been close since.'[Miley's] obviously way bigger and all eyes [are] on her,' Sky has previously said of the star.

'But I feel like we’re kind of going through a similar thing where everyone’s trying to say that we’re trying to make ourselves objects, but really, everyone else is making it more like that - sensationalizing sex and reading into things. It’s nice to have someone that gets it.'

The gang: Despite changing her hairstyle multiple times throughout the ten seasons of Friends, Jennifer Aniston just can't stop being associated with The Rachel
