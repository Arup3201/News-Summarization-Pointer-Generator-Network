Daniel Hegglin applied for a High Court injunction after claiming to be the victim of 'extreme internet trolling' but has now settled the case with Google

Google has settle a High Court dispute with a wealthy businessman who said he was a victim of 'extreme internet trolling'. 

Daniel Hegglin, 53, a former Morgan Stanley banker, had applied for an injunction at the High Court to make the search engine take steps to ensure that abusive material posted about him did not appear in search results.

But a lawyer for Mr Hegglin today told a High Court judge that the case had been settled. 

The abuse, which first surfaced in 2011, included false allegations that he is a murderer, paedophile and Ku Kux Klan member.

They appeared on more than 4,000 websites - around half of which are understood to be hosted on Google - and it is believed the material continues to be posted daily.

Today, Hugh Tomlinson QC told Mr Justice Jay at a High Court hearing in London that Google had made 'significant efforts' to remove the abusive material.

He said: 'This case was brought against Google in order to seek extra assistance to combat a campaign of anonymous and extreme Internet trolling on over 4,000 websites. 

'Whilst I am not in a position to disclose the details, I am pleased to report that the parties have now settled the matter.

'The settlement includes significant efforts on Google's part to remove the abusive material from Google hosted websites and from its search results.'

Mr Hegglin will now concentrate his energies on bringing the person responsible for this campaign of harassment to justice.'

A lawyer representing Google said Mr Hegglin's case was exceptional.

'Google has considerable sympathy for Mr Hegglin in what is an exceptional case of internet trolling in terms of its prominence and volume,' Antony White QC told the judge.

'Google provides search services to millions of people and cannot be responsible for policing internet content.

'It will however continue to apply its procedures that have been developed to assist with the removal of content which breaches applicable local laws.'  

Mr Hegglin is a Swiss national and currently lives in Hong Kong but built his career over two decades at Morgan Stanley in London. 

He is married to a British woman and spends 40 days a year in the UK attending to his multiple business interests, which include a non-executive directorship at Puricore plc.

The father-of-four claimed that the abuse was damaging his business life and upsetting his family.

Google had argued that it already has a system in place to remove individual web addresses (URLs) and that it would be wrong for the court to order it to block the abuse as it appears.

The court heard the abusive material appeared on more than 4,000 websites - around half of which are understood to be hosted on Google

It also denied that it should be ordered to remove any material from Google.com, which it claims is the US version of the search website.

The company claimed any keyword-based block would have 'disproportionate consequences' by removing innocent search results.

Google, whose corporate motto is 'Don't be evil', set aside a budget of £1.68m to fight the case in contrast to Mr Hegglin's budget of just over £600,000.

In a hearing shortly before trial, Mr Justice Edis slashed Google's budget on the grounds that it was disproportionate.

The five-day trial was set to test whether Google should do more to combat serious cases of 'trolling' and whether European data protection law applies to Google.com as well as local variants like Google.co.uk.

It follows the recent 'right to be forgotten' decision of the European Court of Justice requiring Google to delete 'inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant' results on request. 

One example of the trolling campaign is an abusive and unfounded posting containing allegations that he is a paedophile and describing him as a 'Jack the Ripper bastard criminal'.
