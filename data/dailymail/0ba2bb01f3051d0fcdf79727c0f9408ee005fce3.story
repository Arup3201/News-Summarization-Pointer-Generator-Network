Richard Sandon was subjected to the 'cowardly' unprovoked attack while using his mobility scooter in Peterborough

A disabled RAF veteran has been left with serious injuries after being knocked out of his mobility scooter and stamped on by a thug who had tripped over his dog's lead. 

Richard Sandon, 52, who needs the scooter to get around, was subjected to the 'cowardly' unprovoked attack while travelling along a towpath in Peterborough. 

He moved out of the way when he saw the other man approaching but his dog - who is deaf - crossed the path and the suspect tripped on the lead.

Despite Mr Sandon apologising, he was punched in the face and knocked out of his scooter. The man then punched and stamped on him as he lay on the ground.

Cambridgeshire Police have released a picture of Mr Sandon in his hospital bed in order to highlight the attack, which happened at about 7.30pm on Friday near the bridge at Railworld.

The dog, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Blue, was also kicked but not seriously hurt.

Mr Sandon said: 'I cannot understand what sort of person would attack me and my dog Blue in this way.

'I am a disabled man who is obviously unable to defend myself.

'Blue is deaf and wears a high-visibility coat which states this. Neither of us were a threat to this man. I hope he is caught so he cannot do this to anyone else.'

Mr Sandon retired from the RAF after 17 years of service after being shot in the leg while in South America.

After Friday's attack, he was treated for a broken arm, fractured ribs, bruised kidneys and has various bruises around his face and body.

Detective Constable Vicky Speirs said: 'Mr Sandon tried to explain that his dog was deaf while apologising but the man launched a vicious and cowardly attack.

'It was an appalling and unprovoked assault on a victim who couldn't defend himself.

'I'm confident there would have been others using the footpath at the time and may have seen this man.'

The attacker, who made off after the incident, was described as wearing a peaked black beanie hat with a red, yellow and green band around it.

He was black, slim, about 6ft 2in, in his late 20s or early 30s, and wearing a military-style green khaki three-quarter-length jacket, jeans and white boot-type trainers.

Anyone with information should call Det Con Speirs on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
