From this weekend, Asda is selling the Kodak Easyshare Mini M200 digital compact for £25.

The camera has a 3x wide angled zoom lens, a 2.5 inch LCD screen and 10 megapixel CCD. It normally retails for £80.

The offer comes shortly after the manufacturer's parent company Eastman Kodak hit the headlines for filing for bankruptcy protection in the U.S..

Cut price: Asda is offering the Kodak M200 at a record low price

Kodak has not yet filed for bankruptcy in the UK.

The 131-year-old group's U.S. wing collapsed after the company had just one profitable year since 2004.

From 2003 the company attempted a four-year digital makeover during which it dynamited aged 
factories, and eliminated tens of 
thousands of jobs.

But Kodak's new business ran directly into the recession, and quickly slipped into the red.

The EasyShare Mini was launched last year, and is one of the company's entry-level cameras.

The resolution isn't cutting-edge, but it still comfortably outperforms most smartphone cameras - both Samsung's Galaxy S2 and iPhone 4S have eight megapixel cameras.

It also has an ‘easyshare’ feature which allows preselected pictures to be simultaneously uploaded to YouTube, Twitter and Facebook when connected to a computer.

As well as being a record low price, it’s Kodak’s smallest ever camera, the size of ten credit cards and it easily fits into any handbag or pocket.

It also has a mirror on the front which helps in composing self-portraits and time shots.  It is available in black, white and red.

Hayley Nancolas, Asda’s photography expert said: ‘This small but perfectly formed camera makes an ideal gift. Shoppers should hurry if they want to snap one up.’

The camera is available online at www.asda.com or by calling 0800 952 3003.
