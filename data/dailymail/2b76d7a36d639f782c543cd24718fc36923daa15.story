A distraught pet owner has told how her dog died after she became overheated during a grooming session at PetSmart.

Cindi Tousel took her dog Gracie to PetSmart in Mentor, Ohio, last Saturday.

The dog, a six-year-old Newfoundland had been groomed at that branch for several years, but when she arrived Tousel was told that her dog's usual groomer was away on holiday.

Owner: Cindi Tousel, a dog lover
took her pet Gracie to PetSmart in Mentor for routine grooming last week

Dog: Gracie was a 6-year-old Newfoundland loved by Tousel and the rest of her family

Tousel said when she found out that a new groomer had to carry out the appointment she conducted a short interview to make sure that her dog Gracie would be in good hands.

However, just four and a half hours later, PetSmart staff told Tousel to take her dog to an emergency vet.

Tousel said that when she picked up her dog, Gracie was drooling profusely and could not walk.

By the time that she got Gracie to the vet, her body temperature had spiked to 109 degrees.

A normal body temperature for a dog is 102 degrees Fahrenheit.

The vet said that overheating was causing Gracie's organs to shut down.

The next day her beloved dog died.

Tousel told WKYC-TV: ‘It shouldn’t happen to anybody who loves their dogs or cats.’

‘You take a perfectly healthy dog in whose tail is waggling and she is kissing everybody in the butt like she always does and you bring out a dog who is suffering and dying and there’s no excuse.

PetSmart: Four and a half hours after Gracie was dropped off at PetSmart, staff told Tousel to take the dog to the emergency vet

In happier times: Sadly a vet told Tousel her dog's temperature had spiked to 109 degrees and she died a day later

PetSmart staff told Tousel that it was very hot in the back room where the dogs were kept.

In a statement, PetSmart said: ‘The safety and well-being of the pets in our care is our top priority.

‘We are conducting a full investigation into this incident and will take appropriate action based on our findings.’

Tousel said she instructed the groomer not to dry Gracie and doesn't know if a heated blow dryer was used but Gracie was completely dry.

She said that the store manager told her the company would pay for her vet bills, which cost more than $2,200.

The company's corporate office has been in touch with her also and sent flowers.

Newfoundlands are known to be heat sensitive; something Tousel would have expected a dog groomer to know.

She is considering her options at this point but hopes all groomers change their policies and make sure the back rooms are kept cool and dogs are monitored for heat issues.
