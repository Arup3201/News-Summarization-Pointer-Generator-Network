These pictures show the horrific injuries an Afghani woman suffered when a man allegedly threw a powerful acid in her face.

Akhtara, 29, lives in a one-bedroom home with her four children in Kabul, Afghanistan.

At the age of ten, she married a rich, elderly man, who was later killed by a jealous nephew, she claims.

The nephew, named Amanullah, killed her husband before asking her for her hand in marriage, she says.

The man left the city for Pakistan, but returned three years later to the mother's home.

When Akhtara opened the door Amanullah threw the acid in her face - leaving her with horrendous scars, it has been reported.

Speaking to Voice of America, Akhtara said: 'On the night my husband was killed I was overwhelmed with grief. Amanullah came and asked me if I wanted to remain a widow until I die or whether I wanted to marry him.

'He promised to give me money and look after me.

'Three years after the death of my husband I heard a knock on the door.

'In my heart I thought he has comeback to apologise for his actions. He immediately threw acid in my face.

'It felt like my face was on fire.'

Akhtara has been unable to find work to support her four children since the attack and is forced to beg on the side of the road to support her children.

She says they often go without - and survive on a diet of bread and tea.

The shocking images come as the United Nations General Assembly launches its International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said today: 'Violence against women and girls directly affects individuals while harming our common humanity.'Â 

He also applauded leaders who are helping enforce anti-violence laws while paying tribute to those who help victims.

UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka urged world leaders to 'mount a response that is proportionate to the violence threatening the lives of women and girls.'

'We need education in schools that teaches human rights and mutual respect, and that inspires young people to be leaders for equality,' she added.
