The Artfinder app lets users share what exhibitions they've been to: Like all Timeline apps, it posts updates about what you're doing to friends, and also offers them a chance to install the app themselves

Facebook has launched 60 new 'timeline' apps - applications that post updates in real time about what people are doing, and also add updates to people's Timeline.

Facebook claims the update - live from today - will allow users to 'personalise' their page more, adding updates that reflect their interests, and sharing them with your friends list, or with lists you authorise for each app.

It has potential to be a radical change to how people view the site, with food fans able to share recipes and restaurant reviews with other users, and book fans able to automatically 'share' what ebooks they've read.

As ever with Facebook, there are privacy concerns.

Many sites recommend vetting apps carefully to see what they will post, and creating lists of friends to 'share' certain updates with, rather than bombarding your whole friends list.

Tech site CNET warns, 'Once you install the app and authorize it to post stories on your 
profile and News Feed, it'll never ask for your permission again.'

The update - live today - will be a huge overhaul for most people's experience of Facebook. The site's algortihm with try to predict posts you are interested in based on your apps and posts, and will prioritise both your news feed, and your own Timeline based on this.

The profile of a foodie will feel distinctly different to the profile of a bookworm, for instance.

Up until now, Timeline apps tended to be largely about music.

After the site's recent overhaul, applications such as Spotify started to post updates saying 'This person is listening to...' which appear in Facebook's news ticker.

But the idea - and the number of updates - is set to go much bigger. The new apps will add updates about cooking, eating, films, concerts, books and travelling.

The apps will add updates to New Ticker (the fast-scrolling feed up the right hand side of Facebook) and to your Timeline. Some may also post directly into your News Feed. Facebook is soliciting developers to make apps for every area of interest

The Rotten Tomatoes app lets people share what films they've watched, and what films they want to watch

The Foodspotting app is one of several applications that let users share recipes, what they've eaten and what they want to try

With Facebook's new 'frictionless sharing', it should mean that people's news tickers are even more densely populated than ever - and that people, once again, start 'sharing' without realising what they're doing, as users have seen with Facebook games, apps and indeed Spotify.

The apps include timeline apps from Foodspotting, Foodily, Ticketmaster, Pinterest, Rotten Tomatoes, Pose, Kobo, Gogobot and TripAdvisor, and others. 

'You can now enhance your timeline with apps that help you tell your story, whether you love to cook, eat, travel, run, or review movies,' says Facebook.

'Once you've added an app, you can begin updating your timeline with your activities as they happen. For example, if you love design, shopping or fashion, you can add the Pinterest or Pose apps to make your favorite items part of your timeline.'

The Kobo app syncs with the popular ebook reader and shares what people have read and 'liked' via their Timeline

'If you love to cook, you can add the Foodily app to your timeline and share your latest dishes. If your friends have added the Foodily app, you can discover new recipes with each other, as you'll see their updates in the ticker and their timeline, and possibly News Feed.'

Facebook says that more Timeline apps, covering more interests will launch soon.

'Our vision for Timeline and our vision for the application platform is whatever you love and whatever story you want to tell, you can add that to your Timeline,' said Carl Sjogreen, Facebook's product management director.Facebook Timeline with Apps and Ticker'Our message to developers is 'start your engines',' said Sjogreen.
