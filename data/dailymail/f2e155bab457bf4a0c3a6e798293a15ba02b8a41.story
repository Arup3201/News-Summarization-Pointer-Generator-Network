A suspicious package at a JFK airport mail sorting facility caused a brief scare and quarantine Sunday--and all because of a bag of cosmetics.

The FBI says a package was tested after two customs workers reported they felt ill after opening it contained beauty supplies.

The package, which originated from China, was likely full of fumes due to a broken bottle of nail polish remover.

Panic: New York HazMat teams and the FBI rushed to JFK airport Sunday after a package in a mail sorting facility tested positive for deadly nerve gas

'The FBI screened and tested the employees and the package they opened,'
 FBI spokesman J. Peter Donald said in a statement. 'The package in 
question was determined to be beauty supplies and nothing further. The 
scene has been cleared by FBI personnel.'

Donald said said agents have cleared the scene.

He said the employees and the package were tested and screened out of 'an abundance of caution.'

Tests initially came up positive for VX nerve gas, an extremely deadly chemical warfare agent.

Cosmetics: An FBI official later called the incident a false alarm and that the package contained only everyday cosmetics. Reports say the culprit was likely a broken container of nail polish remover

The New York Post reports that the Postal Service facility - which is responsible for sorting international mail bound for the eastern U.S. - and a Customs office a quarter mile away were both quarantined.

After the Customs and Border Control agents were overcome, an initial test revealed that the package contained 'chemical-grade weapons and nerve gas.'

A second test said the chemical was VX 
nerve gas, a deadly synthetic chemical weapon that can be absorbed 
through the lungs or the skin.

Precautions: It remained unclear why the tests were initially positive for the deadly nerve agent, but authorities did say the quarantine and evacuations came form an 'abundance of caution

It was unclear why tests were positive for the deadly agent or why retesting remained positive.

A source told the post that breached packaging likely caused the substance to leak out while in transit.

Only two countries - Russia and the United States - are known to possess the nerve agent, though it has been reported that Syria has manufactured it, as well.

Tests for chemical weapons can often return false-positive results.

Fire department HazMat units were on site alongside the FBI Sunday afternoon.

WABC reported that the inspectors were treated at the scene, but then recovered and declined transport to the hospital.

Traffic into and out of JFK International Airport - one of the world's business international hubs - was not disrupted.
