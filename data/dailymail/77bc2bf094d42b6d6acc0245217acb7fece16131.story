Mystery: Joshua Shane, pictured, went missing two days ago while night-swimming with three friends in Thailand

The mystery surrounding an American student who went missing while swimming in Thailand may now have been solved after a body was found this morning not far from the place where the student was last seen.

Joshua Shane went missing two days ago while night-swimming with three friends on Patong beach.

The 21-year-old had arrived in Phuket earlier this week on a study abroad programme with Arizona State University.

A search and rescue mission immediately began following his disappearance, but this was called off yesterday afternoon.

Instead, it was decided to focus on finding his body.

The plot thickened when Phuket Marine Police said this morning that a local resident had found a body washed up on Kalim Beach - which is just a few minutes away by car from Patong beach.

Speaking to Phuket Gazette, Lt Jeerayuth Onthong of the marine police, confirmed a body was found washed ashore at Kalim Beach, however in a bizarre twist, the newspaper later 
reported that a Royal Thai Navy medical team had arrived at the location
where the body had supposedly washed up but found nothing.

It was later reported that a body was found at 7.30am this morning close to where Joshua Shane disappeared.

It is not clear if the body is the same as the one spotted by villagers on Kalim Beach.

Staff at Patong Hospital said that no one can confirm that the body is Mr Shane due to the condition it is in.

Speaking at the scene, marine police officers said the search for Mr Shane's body had now been completely called off. Instead, they will wait for reports from members of the public.

Mr Shane, from Kansas, had arrived in the country earlier this week as part of a 20-strong group who were studying under a project called 'Urban Sustainability and Planning in Thailand'.

Arizona State University students have been offered counselling for those students who knew Mr Shane.

His family said he had been passionate about international social justice and the sustainability of the planet.

A family statement, reported by KCTV, said: 'He was here to make the world a better place.

'We would like to thank those involved including the people of Thailand and Arizona State University for their dedication and compassion during this difficult time.

'We will continue to be inspired by Joshua's life and appreciate the outpouring of support and prayer.'
