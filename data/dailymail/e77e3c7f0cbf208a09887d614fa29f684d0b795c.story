Rolf Harris, pictured, has been handed a job as a prison gardener, it has emerged

Rolf Harris has angered fellow inmates after being handed a ‘plum job’ as a prison gardener, it has been claimed.

The paedophile was given the task just weeks after being convicted - and other prisoners believe he may have ‘jumped the queue’ to land the cushy role.

According to a report in The Sun, Harris, 84, is now being paid to look after the vegetable patch and parts of the grounds at Bullingdon Prison in Oxfordshire.

But one prisoner said he had been waiting 12 months for a similar job. 

'Harris should be cleaning the toilets after what he did, it's completely unfair,' he told The Sun. 

Another reportedly said: 'We all know he is a creative man but that doesn't mean he should get the plum job.'

The Sun reports a source as confirming that prison bosses had agreed to let him work in the gardens but dismissed claims he had jumped the queue to land the job. 

Prisoners are said to earn around £9.60 a week for carrying out jobs ranging from cooking and cleaning to gardening and carpentry.

A Prison Service spokeswoman told the newspaper that it did not comment on individuals. 

The entertainer, once a family favourite, was unmasked as a paedophile who was fixated with underage girls after his trial at Southwark Crown Court.

He was jailed for five years and nine months for his decades preying on victims including Wendy Wild, Australian Tonya Lee and another girl who was in her early teens, and abusing his daughter's friend for 16 years.

Earlier this month it was confirmed that lawyers representing Harris have lodged papers at the Court of Appeal asking for permission to appeal against his conviction for 12 counts of indecent assault.

He has already been stripped of a Bafta fellowship and faces losing his prestigious CBE in the wake of his conviction.

His multi-million pound fortune is also at risk from potential compensation claims.
