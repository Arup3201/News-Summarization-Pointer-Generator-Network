Ho HO HO: A Massachusetts man who plays Santa Claus at a local mall was arrested Saturday on charges he groped an 18-year-old elf assistant's butt

A shopping mall Santa Claus in Massachusetts will be bringing no more holiday cheer this year after one of his female little helpers told police he pinched her buttocks.

Herbert G. Jones, 62, of Assonet was arrested Saturday after a crying 18-year-old woman who played one of Santa’s elves ran crying to cops to report the incident at the Hanover Mall.

Jones denied the charge in court Monday, but a judge nonetheless banned him from working as the Saint Nick for the rest of the season.

Jones and the unidentified elf were 
employed with Cherry Hill Photos.

The woman was working as a 
photographer and taking pictures of Jones for the children sitting with 
him that day.

The woman told police Jones said, ‘I wish you were a few years older and I was younger.’

Jones denied her allegations and claimed the woman bumped up against him.

According
 to Wicked Local, their manager told police the woman had been in a bad 
mood all day after she was questioned over some missing money.

‘I did not touch that girl,’ Jones told police when he was taken from the dressing room.

He was hauled away in plain clothes, not his Santa uniform, police noted.

While Jones is out on $1,000 bail, he is not allowed to play a Santa, said Judge Francis Marini.

He is due back in court on Christmas Eve.

Naughty list: A judge told the penitent-looking Jones on Monday that he may not play Santa any more this season. Jones denied the charges and is due back in court on Christmas Eve
