A golf course could be forced to close after offering a promotion for nine holes for $9.11 on the 12th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks.

Tumbledown Trails Golf Course in Verona, Wisconsin posted an ad in the Wisconsin State Journal on Monday offering '9 holes with cart for only $9.11 per person or 18 holes with cart for only $19.11!'

But the company was immediately lambasted online as distasteful and was forced to apologize on its Facebook page. It said it is now considering closing on September 11, as staff fear a backlash.

'Please stay tuned to see if we will be 
open on Weds 9/11,' the posting read. 'We 
are now worried about what people will do/say to our staff & do not 
want anything to happen or get out of control. Sorry for the 
inconvenience this may have caused anyone.'

Club owner and general manager Marc Watts told The Associated Press that no disrespect was intended with the advert.

Watts said people are even calling the club with death threats, adding that a sheriff's deputy has now been stationed there.

The course officials said that booked tee times for Wednesday will be honored and that other golfers will pay the normal rate. The difference between the rates will be donated to the 9/11 Memorial.

'We hope that everyone will now see this as a positive as we really meant it to be,' the Facebook post read. 'Again, we do sincerely apologize for offending anyone & hope that you do accept our sincere apology.'

Some commenters accepted the apology while others weren't so happy.

'9/11 is a painful, frightening memory for those of us who were living and growing up in the Northeast,' one commenter wrote.

'For those who were there and who lost parents, relatives and friends, it is a nightmare they must face at this time every year for the rest of their lives. To exploit these horrors for profit is sickening.'

But another commenter, who identified himself as a military veteran, added: 'If I lived within a couple hours drive of this course I would head on up tomorrow to play a round of golf. Why? Because I believe in my heart of hearts that they meant NO ill will in this ad.

Anger: Hundreds of people flocked to the course's Facebook page and complained about the promotion

'The intent of these owners was not to profit off a tragedy. Their intention was to give a break to the average Joe on a day when those that would have us wallowing in misery at the memory of what pure evil accomplished.'

Others pointed out that the company clearly did not wish to profit as they would be making a great loss on their usual prices with the deal. Nine holes usually costs $18 at the course, while 18 holes with a cart usually costs $43.

Nearly 3,000 people died in the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and in a hijacked flight that crashed in Shanksville, Pa.
