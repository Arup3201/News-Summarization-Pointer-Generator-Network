Ms Mantel's story depicts the murder of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (pictured) at the hands of an IRA gunman

The BBC provoked fury last night over its plans to broadcast a ‘sick’ story imagining the assassination of Margaret Thatcher.

The fantasy, by bestselling author Hilary Mantel, was condemned as ‘perverted’ and ‘distasteful’ when it was published in September.

Now The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Radio 4 has selected the story for its prestigious Book At Bedtime slot – sparking a furious backlash.

Supporters of the former Prime Minister accused the broadcaster of being deliberately provocative with a move that will stoke accusations of BBC bias against the Tories. ‘It is a sick book from a sick mind and it’s being promoted by a sick broadcasting corporation,’ former Cabinet Minister Lord Tebbit said.

Ms Mantel’s story depicts the callous murder of the former Prime Minister by an IRA gunman and was inspired by the Booker Prize-winning author’s own fantasy about assassinating Lady Thatcher, who she admits to ‘detesting’.

The broadcast on January 9 will increase tensions between the BBC and the Government after David Cameron and George Osborne accused the Corporation of bias in its coverage of spending cuts.

The Assassination Of Margaret Thatcher will be read by Shakespearean actress Dame Harriet Walter in a 13-minute broadcast understood to have been commissioned by Caroline Raphael, the executive responsible for comedy and fiction on Radio 4.

Last year Ms Raphael came under fire after critics claimed there was overt Left-wing bias in the station’s comedy programmes.

Lord Tebbit – whose wife Margaret was paralysed when the IRA tried to murder Margaret Thatcher and her Cabinet in the 1984 Brighton bombing – called on the BBC’s director-general to stop the broadcast.

He said: ‘The serialisation should never have gone ahead and, if Tony Hall was worth his gigantic salary, he would stop it. It would be interesting to know how much the BBC had paid for the book.’

The Corporation declined to reveal that figure.

Lord Bell a former adviser and friend of Lady Thatcher also criticised the decision

He said: ‘If the BBC had any real sensibility it would leave that subject alone with an Election just five months away. It is inevitably going to be accused of political bias. If it really was independent it would avoid doing things that were provocative.’

Tory MP Conor Burns, Lady Thatcher’s closest confidant and adviser in her final days, added: ‘Given the public controversy that surrounded Hilary Mantel’s original publication of this twisted little story from her disordered mind it seems calculating of the BBC to choose it for Book at Bedtime.’

He added: ‘Leaving aside the distastefulness, it certainly seems to me to be an unfortunate choice for people who are on the verge of a restful night’s sleep.’

The BBC's decision to select Hilary Mantel's (pictured) story for its prestigious Book At Bedtime slot has sparked a furious backlash

Ms Mantel – who was unavailable to comment on the BBC’s impending broadcast – has previously spoken of her assassination fantasy, saying she was once so close to the Prime Minister she could have pulled the trigger herself, saying: ‘If I was someone else she’d be dead.’

Her story features a middle-class housewife who unwittingly lets an IRA hitman into her home and then becomes complicit in the murder.

The two characters make no secret of their hatred of the former Prime Minister who is criticised for her ‘fake femininity’, ‘her counterfeit voice’ and her ‘philistinism’.

The story ends with the terrorist taking aim at the Prime Minister and remarking: ‘Rejoice, F****** rejoice’ – a crude echo of comments made by Mrs Thatcher when she was announcing British victories during the Falklands War of 1982.

Its publication provoked a huge political row in September and the Tory-supporting Daily Telegraph cancelled plans to serialise the story for fear it would offend its readers.

The book caused outrage when it was published in September, with critics calling it 'perverted' and 'distasteful'

Even readers of the Left-wing Guardian newspaper, which did publish the story, found it distasteful. One complained: ‘Thatcher was in very many ways a disaster but she deserves better than this.’

Another wrote: ‘Disgusting – so easy to use Thatcher to get attention... It’s lazy writing... Hilary Mantel should be ashamed of herself.’

The controversial assassination plot is one of ten short stories in an anthology of Mantel’s work, also called The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher.

The BBC which plans to serialise four of the stories across five days beginning on January 5 describes the collection as ‘wickedly witty and mischievous’ in publicity material.

Ms Mantel, whose Booker Prize winning novel Wolf Hall has just been adapted by BBC Two, has made no secret of her dislike for Mrs Thatcher. Shortly after the publication of the anthology she described the Prime Minister as ‘anti feminist’ and a ‘psychological transvestite’.

She said: ‘When I think of her I can still feel that boiling detestation. She did long-standing damage in many areas of national life.’

Ms Mantel also accused Lady Thatcher of acting too much like a man. She said: ‘There has to be a model for women in public life that is not generated out of a male model. We had... Mrs Thatcher in a mythological guise of Britannia wearing her breast plate and having a good war to prove herself more masculine than the men.’

Ms Mantel sparked another controversy last year when she said the Duchess of Cambridge was a ‘shop-window mannequin’ whose only purpose was to breed. She later said her comments had been taken out of context but did not deny saying them.

A spokeswoman for the BBC last night confirmed it would be serialising the book, including the controversial story about the plot to kill Mrs Thatcher. She said: ‘Book at Bedtime offers the best of modern and classic literature and, in doing so, presents a wide range of perspectives from around the world.

‘The work of Hilary Mantel – a double Booker Prize-winning author – is of significant interest to the public and we will not shy away from the controversial subject matter that features in one of the four stories read across the week.’
