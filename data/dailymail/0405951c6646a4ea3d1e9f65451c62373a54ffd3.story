China has warned David Cameron and Nick Clegg of ‘serious consequences’ for Britain after they had a private meeting with the Dalai Lama in London.

Britain’s ambassador in Beijing, Sebastian Wood, was summoned to the foreign ministry to receive a rebuke from China’s vice foreign minister Song Tao.

The foreign ministry said Monday’s meeting between the exiled Tibetan leader and the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister had ‘seriously interfered with China’s internal affairs’.

A spokesman said Mr Song had told Mr Wood the British leaders should fully consider the ‘serious consequences’ of ignoring Beijing’s objections and going ahead with the meeting.

He urged Britain to take ‘practical actions to correct the error’.

A Beijing spokesman said: ‘We call on the British side to . . . stop conniving at and supporting separatist attempts to achieve Tibetan independence, take practical measures to eliminate the terrible impact and take actions to preserve Chinese-British relations.’

Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘The Dalai Lama is an important religious figure. We don’t want to see our relationship with China disrupted by the visit of the Dalai Lama.

‘The Dalai Lama travels all over the world and has visited the UK several times in the past, and I believe that former prime ministers also met him when they were in office.’

The Templeton Prize valued at £1.1m is the world's largest award given to an individual, honouring a living person for making exceptional contributions to spiritual life

Both Gordon Brown and Tony Blair met the Dalai Lama.

The Foreign Office said: ‘British ministers believe that who they see is a matter for them. If they choose to see someone, it does not necessarily indicate they support that individual’s viewpoint.’

The Dalai Lama, 76, has lived in exile in India since fleeing his homeland in 1959 after a failed uprising against Communist rule.

He met Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg at St Paul’s Cathedral, where he received the Templeton Prize for his work affirming the spiritual dimension of life.
