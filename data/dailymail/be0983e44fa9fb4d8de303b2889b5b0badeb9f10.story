In a maneuver straight out of the Cold War, a Russian fighter jet purposely flew 100-feet in front of the nose of an American spy plane in April, US officials confirmed on Monday.

The fly-by over the Sea of Okhotsk between Russia and Japan was described by one US official as 'straight out of a movie'.

The same US official said the Russian jet put the lives of the US Air Force RC-135U in danger and called it 'one of the most dangerous close passes in decades.'

Close-call: A Russian Su-27 fighter jet intercepted an American reconnaissance plane in international airspace over the Pacific in late April - defense officials confirmed on Tuesday

Army Col. Steve Warren, the spokesman, said the Russian Su-27 fighter flew across the nose of the U.S. Air Force RC-135U aircraft, coming within about 100 feet, while in international airspace over the Sea of Okhotsk

Army Col. Steve Warren said the US reconnaissance aircraft - which was in international air space - did not take any evasive measures.

The Russian pilot maneuvered his jet in a way that exposed its belly to the American crew, he said, apparently as a way of showing that it was armed.

Warren said there was no radio communication between the two planes' crews.

He said Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, both raised the matter later with their Russian counterparts.

According to CNN, the United States did not reveal the incident publicly, but Chuck Hagel and his Russian counterpart Sergey Shoygu discussed the issue.

Warren said he could not explain why the incident, which happened April 23, was not made public earlier. 

Asked why the Pentagon didn’t disclose the incident until it was reported on Tuesday by the Washington Free Beacon, spokesman Warren said, 'I don’t have a good answer for you.'

Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney, a former commander in Alaska, voiced his concerns about the provocative Russian action.

'The dangerous intercept by a Russian Su-27 is far worse than we experienced during the Cold War,' McInerney told the Washington Free Beacon.

'In my four plus years as the Alaskan North American Aerospace Defense region commander at the height of the Cold War, we never saw such recklessness by the USSR.'

It is the latest source of concern for U.S. officials since a heightening of U.S.-Russian tensions following Moscow's intervention in Ukraine.

In mid-April a Russian Su-24 fighter made low-level passes over a U.S. Navy ship in the Black Sea.

An RC-135U is a highly specialized reconnaissance plane known as 'Combat Sent.'

There are only two such planes in the U.S. Air Force; both are assigned to the 55th Wing at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska.

Their crews are from the 45th Reconnaissance Squadron and the 97th Intelligence Squadron of the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency.

The 'Combat Sent' aircraft are equipped with communications gear designed to locate and identify foreign military radar signals on land, at sea and in the air.

The crew is composed of two pilots, one navigator, two airborne systems engineers, at least 10 electronic warfare officers and six or more technical and other specialists.
