Divorce battle: Dr Anushika Sharma is involved in an 'acrimonious divorce' battle with her ex-husband and his family - particularly his mother - over a £10million chain of dental practices

A ‘strong mutual antipathy’ between a  millionairess dentist and her former mother-in-law is at the heart of a bitter divorce battle, a court heard yesterday.

The dispute over the family business – divided up after the couple’s separation – involves not only the woman’s ex-husband but his ‘controlling’ mother.

Anushika Sharma, 36, and her 45-year-old former husband Sunny, worked together running their ‘niche’ dentistry business and are believed to have had assets worth up to £10million.

They raised two children together as their empire of 12 practices spread across London and the Home Counties.

And when the couple divorced last year, Mrs Sharma took ownership of seven of them.But now Mr Sharma and his ‘strong-willed’ mother Kesh Sharma have insisted that  five of those surgeries belong to them.

The fight has resulted in an atmosphere of ‘unremitting hostility’ between the divorcee, her ex-husband and his family – particularly the older Mrs Sharma, judges were told.

Last year Anushika Sharma claimed she owned seven of the 12 successful dental practices, and family judge Mr Justice Simon, ruled in her favour.

The mother-of-two said she had started a parallel company, to escape ‘interference’ in her commercial affairs by her ‘dominant and highly controlling mother-in-law’.

Sunny Sharma, his mother and his brother Rajesh are now asking three judges at London’s Appeal Court to return ownership to them.

Representing Anushika Sharma, Alan Gourgey QC, told the court: ‘The wife is a dentist and it is common ground that she owns two practices.

‘The beneficial ownership of five other practices has, however, been the subject of dispute between the parties.’

The barrister said the younger Mrs 
Sharma acquired three practices in Hampshire, one in London and one in 
Banbury, Oxfordshire, when she was a director of the family dental 
business.

She had done that because she feared her formidable mother-in-law 
‘controlling’  her and wanted to leave the marriage with her business 
interests intact, Mr Gourgey added.

Referring to the initial hearing, he said: ‘Mr Justice Simon found that,
 at the heart of the case, lay a strong mutual antipathy between two 
very strong-willed women, the husband’s mother Kesh, and the wife.

Dr Sharma claims she is entitled to beneficiary ownership of five of the family's 12 practices, on top of the two she already owns

'Kesh had been the driving force of the Sharma family businesses and she 
held a dominant and highly controlling position within the Sharma 
family.’

He added that the older Mrs Sharma ‘expected deference from her family, 
which she regarded as her due, both as a mother and one of the founders 
of the family fortune’.

But the court heard that Anushika Sharma was ‘aware of her 
mother-in-law’s control’ so obtained ‘fully informed consent by all the 
joint venturers to her acquiring new dental practices for her own 
account’.

Richard Snowden QC, representing Sunny Sharma and his family, argued 
that Anushika Sharma had acted unlawfully in acquiring the five 
practices for her own company while still ‘wearing the hat’ of a 
director of the Sharma family business.

He told the judges that the family’s ‘financial standing’ had allowed 
the practices to succeed and that she owed the business a duty of 
loyalty.

Adding that Anushika Sharma was ‘a daughter-in- law for whom [Kesh 
Sharma] had no warm feelings,’ Mr Snowden argued that the younger woman 
had breached duty of trust.

Mr Gourgey said Anushika Sharma had ‘acted honestly and reasonably’ and 
should not be made to hand over the five practices she had worked so 
hard to establish.

‘Kesh was in complete control of the Sharma family businesses. If 
Anushika fell out with Kesh, she would be vulnerable,’ he told the 
court.

‘Kesh agreed that Anushika would have full control [of the five practices] without any interference.

‘The success of the business relied entirely on Anushika, the only qualified dentist and the driving force of the business.’

In last year’s hearing, which was decided in the younger Mrs Sharma’s 
favour, Mr  Justice Simon said that the family had ‘lived with this case
 for many months of unremitting hostility’.

He added: ‘The two sides are very suspicious of each other and highly antagonistic.’

The Appeal Court judges have reserved their judgment on the case, which will be delivered at a later date.
