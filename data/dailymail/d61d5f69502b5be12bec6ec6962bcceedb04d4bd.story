England may have ditched Alastair Cook but there is no guarantee that it means they will now be playing the dynamic, Twenty20 style one-day cricket that has enthused the rest of the cricketing world.

Sportsmail understands there is just as much chance of Ian Bell, reprieved in the World Cup squad at Cook’s expense, walking out to open the batting with Moeen Ali against Australia at Melbourne on February 14 as there is the more explosive Alex Hales.

England do not think their tactics are wrong going into a World Cup but more that Cook was no longer the right man at the top of the order to fulfil them.

There also remain reservations over whether Hales can prosper in the longer game against two new balls, after his technique was exposed by India last summer.

Cook, meanwhile, revealed he was devastated to miss out on a place in the World Cup squad. 

Speaking on Saturday, he said: ‘I am gutted to be left out of the World Cup squad and it is likely to take me a while to get over the disappointment. That said I wish Peter Moores, Eoin Morgan and the lads all the best for the World Cup. I would also like to thank all the players and fans who have supported me as one-day captain.’
