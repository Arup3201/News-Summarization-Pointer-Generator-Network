Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger believes striker Olivier Giroud has returned from injury a better and more focused player.

The French striker starred on Sunday as he opened the scoring against Aston Villa before turning provider for Mesut Ozil as Arsenal cruised to victory.

Giroud has been in fine form since spending months on the sidelines recovering from an ankle injury picked up just two games in to the Premier League season.

The severity of the forward's problem forced Wenger into the transfer window in the summer as the club lured England international Danny Welbeck to the club.

Many suggested the 28-year-old's future in north London could be in doubt, but he has now scored five goals in his last six league games since making an early return from injury

And the former Montpellier striker's return to both form and fitness certainly hasn't gone unnoticed by Wenger as a resurgent Arsenal look to secure Champions League football once again.  

'He’s much more focused, technically he has improved, his feet have improved, his movement has improved and he has a big presence in the game,' Wenger told Arsenal Player.

'It’s no coincidence that when he comes back, you feel strong. He got a kick during the game (against Aston Villa) and I was a bit cautious with him,' added Wenger.
