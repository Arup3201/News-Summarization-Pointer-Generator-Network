Padraig Harrington, Miguel Angel Jimenez and Jose Maria Olazabal have been announced as Ryder Cup vice-captains to Europe skipper Paul McGinley.

Captain McGinley named Stephen Gallacher, Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood as the final three members of his playing team for Gleneagles on Tuesday, and the Irishman has now finalised his back-room staff.

The big-name trio are synonymous with European success, with 17 Ryder Cup appearances between them, and now form a five-strong line-up behind McGinley, who had already appointed Sam Torrance and Des Smyth as his deputies.

Olazabal is a Ryder Cup legend thanks to his feats during seven appearances as a player, where he danced on the 18th green at Muirfield Village after Europe's victory in 1987 and formed a formidable partnership with his great friend and compatriot, Seve Ballesteros. The 48-year-old Spaniard also led the team to victory two years ago as captain during the Miracle at Medinah and shed tears in the memory of Ballesteros.

'Jose Maria's passion for the Ryder Cup is recognised the world over,' said McGinley. 'It was obvious in his legendary partnership with Seve and was also so very apparent two years ago at Medinah, so I'm delighted he has accepted my invitation to be involved again, once more maintaining that important continuity.' 

Harrington is a three-time major champion and made six appearances in the match as a player, but he has suffered a slump in form and is now ranked as low as 287th in the world. The 43-year-old Irishman was nowhere near qualifying for the team this year.

'Padraig is my oldest friend on Tour and is a guy I have known most of my life,' said McGinley. 'We went to school together, came through the amateur ranks together and have been together in many contests for both Ireland and Europe over the years, so I know what he can bring to the team room.'

Harrington said: 'I am really looking forward to being part of the Ryder Cup from a different angle to the playing side. That aspect of things is something that really interests me and I'm therefore delighted that Paul has given me the opportunity.' 

Jimenez, the evergreen Spaniard, has played in the Ryder Cup four times and was touted earlier in the year as a genuine wildcard selection following his victory at the Spanish Open in May, but the 50-year-old's form faded over the summer.

'Miguel is someone that the spectators love as well as being very popular with all the players,' said McGinley. 'However, he is also a person that I respect very much.'

McGinley added: 'I know it's been common in the past to have three or four vice-captains but I've gone for five because I feel an extra person is justified due to the additional workload which comes from being the home team, in addition to how well I saw such a system working when we ended up having five vice captains under Colin Montgomerie at Celtic Manor in 2010.

'I have complete confidence and trust in all five of my vice-captains and the help they will give me in the difficult quest of trying to retain the Ryder Cup.'

Europe will try to retain the trophy against the United States at Gleneagles from September 26-28. US captain Tom Watson finalised his team on Tuesday with the addition of wildcards Keegan Bradley, Webb Simpson and Hunter Mahan.
