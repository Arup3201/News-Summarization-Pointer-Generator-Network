The cowardly killer who stabbed a British teenager on an idyllic Greek island yesterday hid in shame as he faced a court.

Flanked by police officers, Stelios Morfis, 21, covered his face with a T-shirt as he was led up the steps of Zakynthos Court.

In the hours before being charged with manslaughter for stabbing 18-year-old Robert Sebbage in the heart, he told his father: ‘I never meant to kill the boy, I’m so sorry.’

Robert’s friend Jordan Manson, 18, was left with a punctured lung, and three other British teenager suffered minor stab wounds following the vicious assault on the island.

Yesterday, it was revealed that the taxi driver held a pocket-knife in his fist as he launched a flurry of blows at the group during the altercation in the early hours of Wednesday.

Several of the teenagers were unaware they had been stabbed until they began bleeding. At least one of the youths was knifed as he tried to run away.

The killer’s father, Danny  Morfis, 53, also a taxi driver, yesterday broke his silence to say his son was devastated by his actions and had tearfully apologised to the family over their son's death.

‘I spoke to Stelios and he is more than sorry for what has happened,’ he said. ‘He cried to me in his jail cell and said: “I never meant to kill the boy, I’m so sorry”. He also apologised to Robert’s family for the pain he had caused.’

He added: ‘The knife that he used was my little penknife which I’ve had for years. I use it to peel fruit. It’s a tiny little thing. He never thought it could do that much damage. He lashed out with it and hit Robert. He didn’t know how much he’d hurt him.’

'Accident waiting to happen': Stelios Morfis has been arrested in Zakynthos in connection with the murder of British teenager Robert Sebbage

Stelios Morfis and his accomplice, Dimosthenes Mylonas, 25, spent more than seven hours with Greek prosecutors yesterday.

Morfis, who faces charges of manslaughter and attempted manslaughter, is likely to be sent to Korydallos prison in Athens. Mylonas, who has been charged with aiding the killer, has been released on bail.

It has been revealed that Morfis had been freed just days earlier by police after being arrested over a vicious assault.

Morfis was held by detectives after he apparently savagely attacked a business rival but the investigation was dropped when Morfis apologised to his victim. He was described by locals as ‘an accident waiting to happen’.

After his arrest over Robert's death,
Morfis is said to have told Greek police: 'I could not stand the 
insults and the mockery they were throwing at us. They were targeting us
with lasers and swearing at us.'

The 'gentle' teenager from Tadley, near Basingstoke, Hants, had been enjoying his first foreign holiday on the party island of Zakynthos with a group of friends when he was knifed in the heart and died in the street on the final night of his week-long trip.

The Reading FC fan's devastated parents Andrew 
and Rhian were flown to the the Laganas resort in Greece by tour operators Thomas Cook.

Their arrival came as more details emerged of violent history of the suspect and the simmering tension between the island’s taxi drivers and British tourists.

Morfis, who liked to be
seen with his Rottweiler dogs, had worked as a bodyguard for Zakynthos 
mayor Dionysis Bozikis, the Express reported.

His father Dionysus is a high-ranking member of the local cabbies’ union and a close friend of the mayor, the newspaper said.

Morfis was a taxi driver for the 
Zante Radio Taxi whose president Marinos Nikos said last night he was 
'very, very sorry for the Sebbage family's loss.'

He said that there were ongoing 
clashes between holidaymakers and local drivers: 'We are all very sad at
what has happened, Stelios Morfis was a driver for us. There has been a
some trouble between taxi drivers and tourists in the past.'

Morfis's latest violent incident involves threatening a businessman who runs a tourist train in the party resort.

Taxi drivers on the island are believed to be resentful that the train service is stealing away their customers and livelihood.

Morfis then allegedly attacked one of the train
drivers two weeks later, the Express reported, but police did not 
proceed with the case after Morfis apologised to the victim.

Morfis 
also apparently assaulted a fellow taxi driver at the airport earlier this year 
after he made a private arrangement with tour companies to transfer 
holidaymakers to their hotels.

The source claimed to the newspaper: 'He has been allowed to get away with increasingly violent attacks.'

Witnesses told how Morfis allegedly snapped after one reveller jumped on his cab in the resort’s busy strip of bars.

Residents said the British youths had simply run into the ‘wrong guy’.

Shop
owner Nikos Liveras, 52, said: ‘He is known for having a short fuse. He
would explode at anyone for no reason at all and has been involved in 
many arguments with tourists. He’s not the type to back down.’

In
the hours after the fatal attack, Morfis attempted to evade police 
capture on a speedboat he had moored at a marina, according to reports. 
But officers tracked the  21-year-old thug, described by one local as 
‘an accident waiting to  happen’, to a relative’s house.

But Morfis was detained and the 
alleged murder weapon was recovered from the sea. He and driver 
Dimosthenes Mylonas, 25, are due to appear in court today.

Close friend Jordan Manson, also 18, suffered life-threatening injuries after his lung was punctured in the attack.

But he was said to be out of danger after an operation and was recovering in the intensive care unit at Zakynthos Hospital. He was expected to remain there for a week.

Three other friends in the nine-strong group were also stabbed but were released after treatment.
