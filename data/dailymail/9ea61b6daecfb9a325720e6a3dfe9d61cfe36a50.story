Manchester City star Yaya Toure is in line for another money-spinning kit deal with Puma.

The powerful midfielder is already an ambassador for the sportswear giants, having agreed a boot and kit deal with the firm in 2011.

But Puma chiefs are keen to tie the Ivory Coast international to a new contract, with preliminary talks understood to have already taken place.

Busy summer: Yaya Toure has been with Ivory Coast on World Cup duty as talks have begun to extend his Puma deal

Cracks emerging: Despite winning the Premier League title last season, Toure's agent has claimed his client is unhappy at Manchester City

Happier times: Toure celebrates scoring a crucial goal at Crystal Palace last term and Manchester City are determined to keep hold of their midfield powerhouse

Toure has been a key figure in boosting Puma's appeal in Africa, a key selling point for the firm.

And the fact Puma are also kit suppliers to the Ivory Coast national team makes Toure central to their promotional plans.

Toure's future at the Etihad Stadium has come under scrutiny in recent months after his agent Dmitry Seluk claimed the 31-year-old was unhappy at the club at the end of last season.

City, however, insist their key midfielder is not for sale and he will again feature prominent for Manuel Pellegrini's side next season.
