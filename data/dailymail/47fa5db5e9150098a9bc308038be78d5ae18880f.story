Steven Gerrard starred in Liverpool's win against Leicester on Tuesday night – and manager Brendan Rodgers revealed he is prepared to carefully manage the player's season to get the best out of him.

The 34-year-old, playing behind striker Rickie Lambert instead of the deeper role in front of the back four he occupied last season, scored and showed signs of the midfield force he used to be.

Rodgers and Gerrard speak on a daily basis and the Liverpool boss insisted if they work closely together they can maximise his influence on the team.

Rodgers said: 'No matter how good a player is there comes a time when the wheels are out and they're ready to land. Gerrard's wheels are not out yet, he's got plenty of energy.

'I've shown in my time at Liverpool sentiment doesn't come into it for me. I pick Gerrard because I still think he can influence a game of football for us. People when I first came in were talking about if he can play in the way I work.

'Last season he was magnificent. For me irrespective of the player or status, it's what's best for the team. Right now I know if I can manage him with training and games he can have a real impact. Even approaching 35 he can.

'He's a guy that we look at each game. At this stage in his career it's about the level of the game. He's a very important player for us. He's not 24 anymore. You have to do that with players at this stage in their career. It's about mapping out the season for him.'

After the game, Gerrard refused to be drawn on whether or not he would sign the new contract which has been offered by the club.

Rodgers explained his reasoning for moving Gerrard further forward, adding: 'How I set team up last year Steven was playmaker. He played behind the midfield.

'We had three super quick players; Luis Suarez, Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling. He wasn't defensive midfield. He was playmaker in a deeper position. We don't have that similar type of style this season.

'He can still have a great influence, Steven. We've changed the structure behind that. As a coach you are looking at players and you have to get the best out of them.

'He looked fresh, dropped behind. His natural instinct is to get forward. He had combinations with Sterling and Rickie Lambert. He was outstanding.'

Rodgers also claimed he knew little about the Football Association racism probe into Mario Balotelli and plans to get up to speed on the situation today.
