A thug who launched a violent assault on a headmistress when she told off his son for racial abuse walked free from court yesterday.

Paul Stratford punched and swore at Zita McCormick after she told him his eight-year-old son Brendan would be excluded for a day.

Flanked by colleagues, the teacher told the 31-year-old to calm down. Instead he made for her, punching her and pushing her backward.

Despite the gravity of the offence, 
magistrates decided to impose only a community sentence, telling 
Stratford to pay his victim £100. In another astonishing case yesterday,
 a Romanian thief who ran a £3million cashpoint scam with 9,000 victims 
also escaped jail.

Leonid Rotaru was given an 18-month suspended jail sentence.

Last night, an education expert said 
law and order seemed to have ‘gone out of the window’. Another said 
Stratford, who already had a conviction for violence, should have been 
jailed to deter others from attacking teachers.

The incident took place in June after 
Brendan was accused of a racial outburst against a Somali boy at Seven 
Fields Primary in Swindon.

He also swore at pupils and staff, in 
what Mrs McCormick said was his third act of bad behaviour that week at 
the 222-pupil school.

After calling the boy’s mother to ask 
for him to be picked up at 9.30am, his father arrived and launched his 
attack in the foyer.

A court heard he demanded of Mrs McCormick: ‘Why have you called my son a f****** thug?’

After being asked to calm down, he 
repeated: ‘You called my son a f****** thug’ and ordered the teacher not
 to wave her finger at his boy. He then launched the attack that was 
ended only by the intervention of the caretaker.

Mrs McCormick said before the 
sentencing: ‘It was very frightening but you work on adrenalin.I could 
not let this man get into the school.’

She revealed she has even asked 
parents to take anger management classes: ‘They can’t control the anger 
they have. The school is where they vent anger at public servants who 
are there to protect and educate their children.’

Prosecuted: Stratford claimed he was 'protecting' his son, who was left in tears after Mrs McCormick excluded him from Seven Fields Primary School in Swindon, pictured

Stratford, who was found guilty of 
common assault, was given a nine-month community order by Swindon 
magistrates. Chairman of the bench David Sinclair told him to pay £400 
in costs and £100 in compensation to his victim.

Russell Hobby, general secretary of 
the National Association of Head Teachers, said Stratford’s behaviour 
was totally unacceptable.

‘Sometimes heads need to make tough 
decisions and they need to have society’s full support to make such 
decisions for the sake of all their pupils,’ he added. ‘These types of 
attacks against public servants doing their jobs should be punished very
 severely.’

Chris McGovern, a former headmaster 
who chairs the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘This assault happened
 in a school and that should make the offence more serious. If schools 
aren’t safe then there is no hope.

‘The children first witnessed the 
alleged bullying by this boy, then his father supporting him and then 
the father hitting the headteacher. It is simply unacceptable.

‘This should have been an exemplary 
sentence to ensure that people are put off doing things like this. A 
custodial sentence should have been seriously considered.

‘Often you feel that someone who has 
committed a crime has not been punished as much as they should have 
been. It looks as though law and order has gone out of the window.’

Stratford, who wore a black T-shirt in
 the dock yesterday, claimed he was ‘protecting’ his son, who was in 
tears after Mrs McCormick excluded him for a day. ‘She was 
uncontrollable, she was close to his eye,’ he claimed.

‘I was worried about her pointing him 
in the eye and blinding him. And that’s when I thought I needed to do 
something to protect my kid.’

Details of Stratford’s son’s allegedly
 racist remarks were not revealed to the court, but at a previous 
hearing Mrs McCormick, who said she had not been injured in the assault,
 described the violent aftermath.

She said: ‘Mr Stratford made two huge 
steps and actually punched and pushed me and said “Don’t tell my son 
off”. The punch came first and then it was a push. It was almost like a 
fist and a hand and I came backwards. I said “Don’t hit the 
headteacher”. It’s quite shocking and it’s very frightening.’ Pauline 
Lambert, prosecuting, said Stratford had not met the headmistress prior 
to the attack. After throwing the punch he continued to rant until he 
left the building, she said.

A recent survey by the NAHT revealed as many as one in ten head teachers has been physically assaulted by a parent or carer.

The 1,362 heads surveyed in England, 
Wales and Northern Ireland reported being punched, spat on, kicked, head
 butted, bitten and sexually assaulted.

Twice as many reported being 
victimised on social networking websites. One described a ‘serious 
kicking attack’ that left its victim ‘badly bruised’ and with 
‘difficulty walking for a couple of days’.

In one case a head said a parent had tried to run them over in the car park. Another had a table thrown at them.

And one description read: ‘Punched in the face, bitten, kicked, spat at, hand down T-shirt to grab breasts, hair pulled.’

A cashpoint fraudster walked free from court yesterday despite being caught with the private details of 9,000 bank customers.

Leonid Rotaru, 32, was captured red-handed by police as he returned to remove a card-reading device from a supermarket cash machine.

Officers said the Romanian was a member of an organised gang and already on the run from another force for the same crime.

Scam: Leonid Rotaru,  front right was involved in a sophisticated bank card fraud thought to be worth in excess of £3 million and with 9,000 potential victims. He is pictured walking free from court

When they raided his home they found details of 9,000 bank cards, including personal identification numbers (PINs) – on his computer which could have bagged him up to £3.25m.

But he escaped a jail term when he admitted four charges of fraud and possessing various illegal devices at Taunton Crown Court.

Sentencing him to a suspended 18-month jail term, Judge Graham Hume Jones said: ‘This is a sophisticated scam by which a number of people could have been victims.

‘Even if they had been repaid by the banks, the banks themselves would have been the victims, and ultimately the banks’ customers.’

Criminals use a wide range of tricks 
to steal private banking details, including increasingly sophisticated 
skimming machines. Last year more than £36m was stolen.

In July 2008, Romanian fraudster Adu 
Bunu was jailed for five years after he was convicted of cloning more 
than 2,000 cards, which allowed him to steal up to £1.1million.

In October 2011, another Romanian, 
Ion Matei, 34, was jailed for a year after using mousetrap paper to line
 ATMs [automated teller machines] so that when customers tried to 
withdraw their cash, the notes stuck to the paper and did not emerge 
from the slot.

Criminal: The 32-year-old helped to fit 'skimming' devices on cash dispensers, which downloaded the card details of those who used them

In the latest case to come before the
 courts, Rotaru – who has lived legally in Britain for three years – 
used a sophisticated card-reader, sometimes known as a ‘skimmer’. It 
fitted over the slot where customers enter their cards and automatically
 recorded information on the magnetic card strip.

At the same time a hidden pinhole 
camera would record the victim entering their PIN on the keypad. The 
crook could then use the information to make duplicate cards.

Free: Mr Rotaru was given an 18-month jail term, suspended for two years

The father-of-two was caught out after a  customer at a Tesco store in Minehead,  Somerset, called police after becoming  suspicious. Officers looked at CCTV and saw Rotaru fitting the device and he was arrested as one of them recognised him when, by chance, he returned to collect it.

They raided his home in Bridgwater and discovered he had built up a massive hoard of private banking information. They also found evidence Rotaru emailed the details to other members of the gang so they could ‘cash in’.

When interviewed, he told police he was ‘at the bottom end’ of the operation, and that the ‘big boys operated out of London’. He refused to identify them.

The court heard Rotaru skipped bail while under investigation for another fraud in Axminster, Devon, in 2011.

He was eventually convicted by a jury after his DNA was discovered inside the inner  components of the tiny device.

Speaking outside court, Barry 
Douglas, of Avon and Somerset Police, said Rotaru was part of a well 
organised gang. He added: ‘Banks say the average fraud per card is 
£460.’

Detective Chief Inspector Paul 
Barnard, who leads the police’s cheque and plastic crime unit, told the 
Mail in March that 92 per cent of all ATM fraud in Britain is committed 
by Romanian nationals.

Officers warned there were an estimated 1,000 Romanian cashpoint gangs in Britain, raking in an estimated £30m a year.
