These photographs may look as if they have been taken on another planet, but they are actually the work of a creative maths teacher who travels to the wonder of nature that is Mendenhall Glacier each year to chart its ever-changing progress.

He is often accused of doctoring the images using CGI or Photoshop, but 31-year-old Kent Mearig insists that all he has to do to capture the stunning scene from beneath is to precisely line up the rising sun against the inside of the tunnels that form the ice sheet.

Other pictures show the details of this natural wonder formed by the continual melting and freezing of the glacier up-close.

Spectacular: Maths teacher Kent Mearig took these impressive pictures from the inside of Mendenhall Glacier in the remote wilderness of Alaska

Lightshow: The creative talent behind the set of photos has managed to capture the beautiful images by lining up the rising sun with the inside of a glacial tunnel

Annual visit: Each year Alaskan 31-year-old Mr Mearig pays a trip to the glacier to chart its ever changing progress with his camera

Ice cold: A river flows underneath as the glacial melts to water. In the back a glimmer of the early morning sun can be seen starting to rise

Amateur photographer and high school Maths teacher, Kent Mearig, who lives in Alaska, visits the Mendenhall Glacier each year to record the sight of his favourite place.

The 31-year-old explained the reaction his jaw-dropping pictures cause.

He said: 'People sometimes refuse to believe that there is truly any place in the world that is the basis for all my photos.

'They want to think that CGI and Photoshop are posing as nature, but anyone who has actually visited a subglacial cave can vouch for the legitimacy of my photographs.

'Among all responses, the word I think I've heard most frequently is "otherworldly", and they're right.

'The world beneath a glacier is like no other place on earth'

Real deal: Mr Mearig is often accused of having doctored the photographs using CGI or Photoshop, but he insists they are the result of natural light

Wilderness: The Mendenhall Glacier stretches 12 miles from its beginning in the Juneau Icefield to where its end at the edge of the Mendenhall Lake

Natural wonder: The Mendenhall Glacier in one of America's remotest wildernesses has been formed by a continual cycle of melting and freezing

The Mendenhall Glacier is roughly 12 miles long, from where it begins in the Juneau Icefield to where its end at the edge of the Mendenhall Lake in the USA's most remote wilderness state, Alaska.

The glacier was named after the US scientist Thomas Corwin Mendenhall.

'Over the years, the Mendenhall Glacier has become almost like a faithful companion to me.

'It's a place I can count on to relieve stress and spark creativity. In spite of the comfortable routine developed in countless trips to the ice, the Mendenhall Glacier is constantly evolving.

'It provides endless variation, and leads to my continued fascination.'
