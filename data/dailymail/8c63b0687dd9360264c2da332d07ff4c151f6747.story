Manchester United: £228.8million. Chelsea: £186m. Manchester City: £154.95m. At a combined cost of half a billion pounds, this trio had the most expensive starting XIs over the weekend's fixtures.

Yet Aston Villa downed Liverpool on Saturday with a starting side which was compiled spending an astonishingly low £13.6m, less than 10 times the amount of those Premier League superpowers (and less than Mario Balotelli).

Sat in second place behind leaders Chelsea, Villa are becoming the Robin Hood of the Premier League, stealing points from the rich clubs and keeping them for the poor.

Aston Villa are currently second in the table despite manager Paul Lambert's shoe-string budget

Liverpool paid £16m for Mario Balotelli, making him more expensive than Aston Villa's starting XI

Brad Guzan, 30, £600,000 from Chivas

The American stopper is finally making the No 1 spot his own after a loan spell at Hull and even ending his contract in 2012 before re-signing for the club. 

Alan Hutton, 29m £3m from Tottenham

Ended a frustrating time at Spurs only to land himself in a completely new one, being part of Lambert's 'Bomb Squad' when he made a group of first-team players train with the reserves, but has now been brought back into the fold.

Nathan Baker, 23, academy graduate

Joined Aston Villa aged 13 and after going out on loan at Lincoln City and Millwall is not establishing himself in Villa's defence.

Philippe Senderos, 29, free from Valencia

The Swiss failed to make an impression in Premier League at Arsenal, Everton and Fulham but Paul Lambert has seen enough in the player to bring him back. 

Aly Cissokho, 26, £2million from Valencia

The left-back did not do enough on loan at Liverpool last season to earn a permanent switch, but Lambert moved for him instead.

Tom Cleverley, 25, loan from Manchester United

Made the latest of deadline day moves away from Manchester United after being vilified by their fans. He has been handed a fresh start in the Midlands.

Ashley Westwood, 24, £2m from Crewe

One of the many players to come from Crewe's prolific production line of young talent, he signed a four-year deal in 2012 and has flourished under Lambert.

Fabian Delph, 24, £6m from Leeds

Was the surprise name in England's starting line-up against Switzerland and his reputation is soaring. Started his career at Leeds but Villa beat a host of top-flight clubs to his signature in 2009.

Kieran Richardson, 29, free from Fulham

The controversial left-sided player jumped ship from Fulham when they sunk back into the Championship last season. He has plenty of Premier League pedigree, playing at Manchester United, West Brom and Sunderland as well.

Andreas Weimann, 23, academy graduate

The sharp-shooting striker started his footballing education at Austrian sides Stadlau and Rapid Wien, but Villa poached him in 2007 when he was just 16.

Gabriel Agbonlahor 27, academy graduate

Villa through-and-through, having been at the club since 1994 and working his way through the academy. The rapid forward has won three England caps.

Total: £13.6m

The Aston Villa starting XI that beat Liverpool cost just £13.6m, and included three academy graduates

Simon Mignolet, £9m from Sunderland

Javier Manquillo, loan from Atletico Madrid

Dejan Lovren, £20m from Southampton

Mamadou Sakho, £18m from PSG

Javier Moreno, £12m from Sevilla

Steven Gerrard, academy graduate

Adam Lallana, £25m from Southampton

Jordan Henderson, £16m from Sunderland

Philippe Coutinho, £8.5m from Inter Milan

Lazar Markovic, £20m from Benfica

Mario Balotelli, £16m from AC Milan 

Total: £144.5m

They are joined by the Merry Men of Swansea, whose starting XI this weekend cost just £24.18m, and Southampton, at £45.3m, in third and fourth, keeping ahead of the big-spending clubs with their early-season form. How long can they keep it up?

Swansea's entire 25-man Premier League squad was built by spending just £52.73m, Southampton only £89.2m and Villa £139.5m.

It means that so far this season Swansea have spent just £5.9m per point they've won so far, Southampton £12.7m and Villa £13.9m.

While the richest clubs in the league shower money on world stars, these three are managing to muscle their way at the top end of the table on a comparatively frugal budget.

Manchester United  have now become the most expensively-assembled squad in the league after splashing huge sums on the likes of Angel Di Maria, Juan Mata, Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera, overtaking rivals City and Chelsea.

Liverpool have over-taken Arsenal and Tottenham after their summer splurge and have gone over the £200m mark.

But it is Villa, Swansea and Southampton who are keeping up with Chelsea and setting the early pace.
