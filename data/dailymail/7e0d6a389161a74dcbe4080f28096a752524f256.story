Sir John Major said Nigel Farage's win would inadvertently help David Cameron 

UKIP's stunning election victories last week will help David Cameron win concessions from Europe, former Prime Minister John Major claimed today.

Sir John said European leaders could no longer ignore rising euroscepticism and return powers to Britain in the Prime Minister's renogotiation.

He predicted that the Prime Minister would win restrictions to free movement rules to curb immigration.

Sir John claimed the success of Ukip and other anti-EU parties would force other European leaders to listen to Mr Cameron's demands.

But he said despite Nigel Farage popularity his party would soon slump in the polls.

He said UKIP was a 'very intolerant' party and its appeal is not likely to last for a 'long time' despite its success in the European elections.

Sir John Major said: 'The recent European elections have emphasised that very clearly. I think the results of these negotiations right across Europe have made a renegotiation much easier.

'It’s apparent now to governments right across Europe that reform of the European Union is necessary – it isn’t working as it should, it isn’t working in the way in which European citizens think it should.

'And I think that gives a great deal of power to the British determination to renegotiate because they will have allies today which in the 1990s we, frankly, didn’t have.'

He claimed the UK had won concessions from European in the past and Mr Cameron would be able to do the same.

The former Tory leader said: 'Many people, when I went to Maastricht said it would not be possible to negotiate Britain out of the euro, I did.

'They said it wouldn’t be possible to negotiate us out of the social chapter, I did.

'More recently, they said David Cameron couldn’t negotiate a budget reduction, he did.

'Now, they’re just three, there are several other things the Prime Minister has done which people said couldn’t be done. So let us not say it can’t be done - it can be done and I think this Prime Minister can do it and I think these recent elections will help him do it.'

David Cameron, speaking shortly after arriving in Brussels this week, demanded that the EU stopped being so 'bossy'

Sir John said people would 'surprised' with how much the Prime Minister would be able to do.

He said: 'Of course, nobody can be certain what will happen, but as the Prime Minister has said himself, free movement of people cannot be unqualified and I think that is very important.'

He added: 'Free movement of capital, trade and people is one of the fundamentals, but I think that is an issue that will have to be addressed by governments other than us. 'And I think there are some things that could be done, as the Prime Minister’s already said, free movement to take up work, not benefits.

' I don’t think you can have an absolute restriction on movements, but maybe you could qualify it in different ways and I think that is something that would find an echo in many European governments, as well as here.'

The former PM also insisted that Mr Cameron would bring back enough from other EU leaders to satisfy British demands and win a referendum.

He said the public would back Britain's place in Europe - and eventually lose interest in UKIP.

Sir John said Mr Farage has been 'very smart.. at exploiting grievances'.

But he warned that the arguments for quitting Europe are 'absolute nonsense' and said it would cost billions.

He said: 'Ukip are extremely good at exploiting grievances and people are very upset about Europe. Politically, Ukip have been very smart in exploiting those disagreements, but Ukip are not, frankly, a very tolerant party.

'I don’t think their appeal is one that is instinctively likely to continue for a long time and I think we have seen that in some of the things they have done recently. So I think they are there and of course they are an impediment for the moment.'

He added that the investment which has helped Britain's economic recovery had not just come for our 'pretty blue eyes' but because of the single market and the European Union.

He said: "Frankly [those calling for Britain to leave the EU] are wrong. Much of this publicity about that is absolute nonsense. We would lose free access to the single market ... we’d have to pay for access to the single market.'
