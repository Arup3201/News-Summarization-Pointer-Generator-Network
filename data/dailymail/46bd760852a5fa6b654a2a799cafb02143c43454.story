This footage shows the terrifying moment an angry elephant charged at a car full of tourists on safari at an African game reserve.

David Griek posted the video on YouTube last week after returning from the Zulu Nyala Game Lodge in South Africa.

The elephant can be seen tearing a branch from a tree and charging at the unsuspecting group twice in the heart-stopping video.

Mr Griek said: 'We came across the only three elephants within the reserve. They were tucked away in the trees.

'After spending some time viewing them, the littlest one started getting aggressive towards the truck.

'Then one of the bigger ones stepped in and she used a stick with her trunk as a weapon, including ripping a branch out of a tree and charging at us with it twice.'

It is not known whether the elephant was in musth - a sexually aggressive period among male elephants.

At the start of the footage the elephant can be seen standing in the middle of a dirt road while eating leaves before the sight of the car makes it agitated

After the elephant charges the drivers speeds his vehicle away. The huge animal continues to chase it down the road, but eventually gives up and goes back to eating
