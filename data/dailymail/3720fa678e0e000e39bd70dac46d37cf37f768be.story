French police have stepped up their search for a Chinese billionaire and two others feared dead after their helicopter crashed.

Lam Kok, a 46-year-old Chinese businessman, was surveying a newly-purchased vineyard in southwest France with his interpreter and advisor Peng Wang and or winemaker James Gregoire when their aircraft crashed into the Dordogne river.

Officer last night recovered the body of Lam's 12-year-old son, Shun Yu Kok, from the back of the wrecked helicopter, which was lying in 23ft of water in the Dordogne river.

Rescue: French police scour the Dordogne river in search of Lam Kok and his fellow passengers

Efforts: More than 100 police are involved in the search after the helicopter crash on Friday

Desperation: A relative of Mr Kok's shouts his name from the riverbank

The four had boarded the helicopter, piloted by Mr Gregoire, on Friday to make a celebratory tour of a Bordeaux chateau and wine-growing estate that Lam had just bought from him.

After pausing the search on Saturday night, divers resumed scouring the cold waters of the Dordogne around 9.00am today.

'We are meticulously combing the area, with practically no visibility, almost by hand,' local gendarmerie commander Ghislain Rety said. Police said strong currents were hampering the search.

Hunt: Police sources said that the search was difficult because of very poor visibility

Helicopters with infra-red cameras 
were flying over the river and a special sonar designed for finding 
bodies had arrived from the French city of Strasbourg, Mr Rety said.

Some 100 police were searching along the riverbanks and reinforcements were expected.

Officials were expected to carry out an autopsy on Mr Kok's son today, but officials said there was little hope the reasons for the crash would be identified quickly.

'The causes of the accident have not been determined at this stage and most likely will not be for several weeks,' local prosecutor Christopher Auger said.

Rescue operation: Search lights shine across the
 Dordogne after the helicopter Mr Kok and Mr Gregoire were travelling in
 apparently plunged into the river as they made an aerial survey of the 
property

Grim search: Divers look out from their boat as they 
hunt for signs of the two men. Mr Kok's 12-year-old son and an 
interpreter were also aboard the aircraft, which an eyewitness reported 
seeing plummet into the river

Major operation: Emergency helicopters and 
around 100 officers joined the search which began after the helicopter 
did not return after 20 minutes and those who had stayed behind 
contacted emergency services

Mr Kok's wife pulled out at the last minute saying she was 'scared of helicopters', an AFP photographer at the scene said.

Mr Gregoire had bought the land and its 8th Century chateau in 2003 after Jean Leprince, the previous owner, died when his aircraft also crashed nearby.

All in the helicopter had been taking part in a celebratory press day, marking the sale of the historic estate.

They were planning to take a short tour of the vineyard and the grounds of the Château de la Riviere, and when they did not return after 20 minutes, those who had stayed behind contacted emergency services.

Desperate: Inflatable boats were deployed after 
police received a call from a member of the public indicated the 
helicopter may have fallen into a nearby river, but no trace of the 
helicopter has yet been found

Ill fated: The party had been planning to take a short tour of the vineyard and the grounds of the chateau

A major search operation was launched using emergency helicopters and around 100 officers on foot.

Inflatable boats were deployed after police received a call from a member of the public indicated the helicopter may have fallen into a nearby river, but no trace of the helicopter has yet been found.

In a bizarre twist of fate, a previous owner of the Château de la Riviere -- one of the region's oldest estates -- was killed in a helicopter crash in 2002.

Mr Gregoire bought the 160-acre property, the largest in Bordeaux's Fronsac appellation, the following year.

The business of luxury: Mr Kok's Brilliant 
group, which specialises in rare teas and luxury hotels in China, had 
said it wanted to turn the château into a high class tea and wine 
tasting centre

Shake on it: Mr Kok's company, Hong Kong-based Brilliant group, whose interests 
range from Pu'er - a dark fermented tea from China's Yunnan region - to 
top-end resorts, also planned to build a hotel near the chateau

 buying power has been credited with pushing prices for certain vintages
 to record levels

Earlier Friday, the vineyard's managing director Xavier Buffo said during a press conference the sale marked the largest Chinese investment in Bordeaux property to date.

Mr Kok's Brilliant group, which specialises in rare teas and luxury hotels in China, had said it wanted to turn the château into a high class tea and wine tasting centre.

The group, whose interests range from Pu'er - a dark fermented tea from China's Yunnan region - to top-end resorts, also planned to build a hotel near the château.

Chinese consumers have developed a taste for the finest French wines and their extensive buying power has been credited with pushing prices for certain vintages to record levels.

In recent years they have increasingly taken to buying vineyards as well. But the level of each transaction has generally been under 10million euros ($13.6 million).
