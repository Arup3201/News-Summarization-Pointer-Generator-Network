Brad Pitt suffered a hit to the face by a Ukrainian serial prankster on the red carpet last night.

The actor was attending the Los Angeles premiere of partner Angelina Jolie's new film Maleficent  when Vitalii Sediuk jumped over a crowd barrier and struck him, breaking the star's sunglasses.

Security instantly intervened as a violent scuffle broke out outside the El Capitan theatre and Sediuk was dragged to the floor and arrested.

An emergency restraining order has been issued against Sediuk as it is now being reported that he broke the glasses that Pitt was wearing to the Wednesday evening premiere.

TMZ reports that Sediuk struck Pitt in the face and 'destroyed' the sunglasses he was wearing.

In the footage from the scene, Pitt is seen wearing sunglasses when the gate crasher lunges at him, and Pitt bends down amid the scuffle. Moments later when security guards step in, Pitt re-emerges without the glasses on his face.

Pitt, 50, who took the unusual step of attending the premiere with his five of his children, is understood not to have been seriously injured in the altercation.

That hasn't stopped a judge from taking legal precautions, however, as Sediuk has been ordered to stay at least 500 feet away from Pitt for the next five days.

The actor was not standing near Jolie when the attack happened - she was in another section greeting her fans.

Pitt was signing autographs when Sediuk, 25, rushed past barriers and hit him in the face.

Whether exactly this kind of attack had been the intention or not, is not clear. 

Violent scuffle: Sediuk was wrestled to the ground by security, nearly losing his trousers in the process

Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Gus Villanueva said Pitt was not seriously hurt and authorities quickly subdued Sediuk, who was arrested for misdemeanor battery and remained in police custody

The red carpet prankster has targeted a series of stars in recent months

Within seconds six to seven security men wrestled him to the ground and Pitt was pulled back against the wall.

Sediuk was thrown to the ground and cuffed as he struggled, his red trousers were nearly pulled down in the fray.

Pitt kept greeting fans and walked into the theater.

Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Gus Villanueva said 
Pitt was not seriously hurt and authorities quickly subdued Sediuk, who 
was arrested for misdemeanor battery and remained in police custody on 
Wednesday night.

Sediuk is now being held pending payment of $20,000 bail.

'The
 officers who were handling him said it looked like it was intentional, 
but at this point, it remains to be determined,' said Sergeant Leonard 
Calderon for LAPD Hollywood.

Before the incident, Jolie said that the El Capitan is like a local theatre for herself, Pitt and their children who usually do not attend her premieres but did Wednesday night.

'Well, oddly, we usually go to the El Capitan, that's where we take the kids. That's the closest theater to us,' Jolie said. 'This is the first time they were able to come to mommy's premiere.'

Maleficent is Disney’s modern reimagining of the Sleeping Beauty fairytale, and Jolie stars as its villain.

The couple’s five-year-old daughter, Vivienne, also stars in the movie as a young Princess Aurora.

However, while her twin brother Knox, along with Maddox, Pax, Zahara and Shiloh, joined their 38-year-old mother and father, the little actress skipped her red carpet moment

Sediuk
 is a serial red carpet pest and only last week tried to put his head up
 America Ferrera's skirt at the Cannes premiere of How To Train Your 
Dragon 2.

In
 2012, Hollywood's nice guy Will Smith angrily slapped Sediuk on the 
face after he tried to kiss him on the lips on the red carpet at the Men
 In Black 3 premiere. 

Will
 managed to dodge two lunges, with each kiss landing on his cheek, 
before he pushed the professional fool away and gave him a limp tap on 
the face. 

Unwanted guest: Last week Sediuk crashed the How To Train Your Dragon 2 red carpet Cannes 
premiere where he climbed under America Ferrera's dress, leaving the actress distressed

Footage showed the angry actor and 
rapper telling him: 'Hey man, what the hell is your problem?' 

At the 2013 Grammys, he was arrested after crashing the stage just as Adele was about to receive her award.

Sediuk
 ran to the podium to accept the accolade from Jennifer Lopez and 
Pitbull before the Skyfall singer could get up the stairs and later 
spent the night in a police cell.

In January of this year, Bradley Cooper was surprised at the SAG awards when the journalist lunged at him. 

He
 knelt and hugged the actor around his waist, putting his face in 
Bradley's crotch to the star's discomfort and embarrassment. 

And
 at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, in February, Leonardo DiCaprio 
became the latest A-lister to fall victim to red carpet prankster.  
Sediuk, also grabbed the star around the waist in a similar move to what
 he did to Cooper. 

However, DiCaprio did crack a nervous smile at the gag. 

Sediuk wore a ridiculous mankini and gold chain while attempting to crash a fashion gala in New York earlier this month
