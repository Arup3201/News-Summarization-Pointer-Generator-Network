The IRS is once again in trouble with lawmakers after a new video featuring agency employees dancing to the 'Cupid Shuffle' was released to The House Ways and Means committee.

The video, which was meant as entertainment for IRS bureaucrats at a recent conference in Anaheim, California is part of a series of IRS training videos that reportedly cost $60,000 to produce.

The videos were made with tax payer dollars and are part of a continued pattern of frivolous spending from the department that is being reviewed by Congress.

Scroll down for video.

The IRS spent taxpayer money to make a silly video with several employees learning the 'Cupid Shuffle' for a 2010 employee conference in Anaheim, California

The video, which features several IRS employees being taught the group dance and making what is meant to be humorous banter such as, 'This is harder than doing an op review,' came to light just a few days before a new report on the spending habits of the government agency.

The report entitled 'Collected and Wasted: The IRS Spending Culture and
 Conference Abuses,' was compiled by the Treasury Inspector 
General for Tax Administration, a government watchdog group.

The group previously uncovered condemning information that the IRS was targeting specific conservative political groups applying for tax-exempt 
status.

The dance video is from the IRS's 2010 employee conference, which will be one of the main focuses of the forthcoming report.

According to The Washington Post, the forthcoming report contains information that the IRS spent approximately $49 million on employee conferences 
over the past three years.

The IRS has made several expensive training videos (such as a Star Trek-themed video pictured here) using tax payer dollars, totaling up to approximately $60,000 spent, according to a report

The Anaheim conference held for 2,600 employees in IRS's small business and self-employed division reportedly cost $4.1 million dollars to put together and was paid for in part with unused funds from the IRS's enforcement budget, according to the newspaper

'Whether it is the tens of thousands 
of hard-earned taxpayer dollars 
spent to produce frivolous entertainment for agency bureaucrats, or the 
IRS’s own admission that it targeted the American people based on their 
personal beliefs, the outrage toward the IRS is only growing stronger,” 
Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Charles Boustany told
Politico in a
 statement.

Boustany continued to say that the video further proves that the 
government agency is a place 'where abuse and waste is the norm and not 
the exception.'

Earlier this year the IRS was caught making two expensive training videos for employees that parodied television shows Star Trek and Gilligan's Island.

After The Ways and Means committee discovered the videos and learned that thousands of dollars in taxpayer money were spent on making them, they demanded the IRS turn over all videos 'depicting television or movie parodies.'

IRS frivolous spending on expensive training videos (a Gilligan Island-based video pictured here) and employee conferences has caught the attention of the House Ways and Means committee, which is reviewing the agency closely

The 'Cupid Shuffle' video was handed to committee as part of the request.

The IRS stated making the expensive training videos after the Obama administration cut the agency's administrative expenses for travel and conferences, The Washington Post reported.

With limited funds to meet their employees face to face, the IRS instead poured their money into the theatrical videos.

In response to the new video, acting IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel called the money spent on conferences in the past 'inappropriate' and promised to institute measures to prevent this from happening again, Politico reported.

'Sweeping new 
spending restrictions have been put in place at the IRS, and travel and 
training expenses have dropped more than 80 percent since 2010 and 
similar large-scale meetings did not take place in 2011, 2012 or 2013,' Werfel said.

The IRS is expected to come under much scrutiny for their spending in the next few days, especially because the agency has repeatedly asked lawmakers for increased funding for their enforcement division, from which they used excess funds on conferences.

At the close of the 'Cupid Shuffle' video the IRS employees are filmed commenting on the dance lesson.

A female employee who turns to the camera and says, 'And I thought doing the Star Trek video was humiliating.'
