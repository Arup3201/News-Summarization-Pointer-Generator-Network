With motorists and cyclists battling for space on London’s congested roads, a company is proposing a £600m ‘floating cycleway’ that would take thousands of cyclists of the streets and put them on the Thames.

Proposed by the River Cycleway Consortium, the Thames Deckway would serve as a nearly eight-mile cycling route from Battersea to Canary Wharf.

The first composite image released by the organisation, founded by artist Anna Hill and architect David Nixon, shows the costly path skirting the south bank in front of City Hall and slipping past HMS Belfast.

'Floating cycleway': The Thames Deckway would run along the south bank for nearly eight miles

A fit cyclist could cover the entire length of the route - from Canary Wharf to Battersea - in 30 minutes

Designed for commuter and leisure cyclists and pedestrians, the east-west cycleway could be constructed along London’s busy waterfront within two years if it is approved, according to the consortium.

Without any vehicular traffic to impede them, fit cyclists could pedal the entire length in about 30 minutes.

The mid-point would be the Millennium Bridge.

Users would be charged £1.50 per journey to cover upkeep costs, while the path’s lights and refreshment kiosks would be powered using solar, tide and wind energy.

With its unique proposal, River Cycleway Consortium is challenging city planners to think outside the box to reduce congestion and pollution while encouraging more people to cycle.

The group is raising money to conduct a feasibility study which will identify how many on- and off-ramps would be required and how it would avoid moorings. It plans to seek private investors if the project proceeds.

But the plan faces hurdles because of its nine-figure price tag and planning requirements.

In its proposal, River Cycleway Consortium said the path would complement the ‘Crossrail for bikes’ plan unveiled by Mayor Boris Johnson last month.

Under that proposal, two new urban cycleways – an 18-mile east-west route from Barking to Acton, and a three-mile north-south route from Elephant & Castle to King’s Cross – would link to other routes at a cost £47m.

Scheduled to open in March 2016, both cycleways would be almost entirely separated from vehicles.
