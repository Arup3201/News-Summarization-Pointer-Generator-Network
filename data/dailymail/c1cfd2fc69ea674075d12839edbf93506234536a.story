Almost 500 children are being hospitalised each week to have teeth removed new figures have revealed. 

It is estimated that one in four primary school children are suffering tooth decay as a result of drinking too much fruit juice or soft drinks. 

The research by the Health and Social Care Information Centre for NHS England found the level of admissions had increased over the past 12 months. 

Almost 500 children a week require surgery to remove rotten teeth according to new research, file picture

In 2010/11, 22,752 were hospitalised in order to have one or more teeth removed. That figure increased to to 25,812. 

In some extreme cases, dental surgeons were forced to remove all of  their milk teeth because of excessive decay.   

Kathryn Harley, consultant in paediatric dentistry at the Royal College told The Sunday Times: 'We have children who require all 20 of their baby teeth extracted. 

'It beggars belief that their diets could produce such a drastic effect.

'They are going into hospital because they are either presenting with acute problems with pain, or because the stage of dental disease, the number of teeth with decay, is such that they need a general anaesthetic. 

A major survey of five-year-old children discovered that more than a quarter were suffering from tooth decay. 

The high level of extractions is being blamed on children consuming too many sweets and soft drinks

According to the survey: 'The results reveal wide variation in the prevalence and severity of dental decay. The areas with poorer oral health tend to be in the north and in the more deprived local authority.'

The figures show that more than half of children in Leicester, 53 per cent, compared with just 12.5 per cent in Brighton and Hove. 

Children in Rochdale have on average five decayed teeth compared with 1.88 in South Gloucestershire. 

More than eight per cent of children aged five in Blackpool have been hospitalised at least once to have a tooth removed. 

The researchers claimed: 'This report highlights the wide variation in the levels of dental decay experienced by five-year-old children living in different parts of the country and in different life circumstances. 

'The cause of dental decay is well understood and is related to the frequent exposure of teeth to fermentable carbohydrates.  

Provisional figures for the the period 2013-14 show that 25,812 children aged between five and nine  have been admitted to hospital to have multiple tooth extractions, up from 22,574 three years previously. 

Some dentists observe how decay progresses in baby teeth because there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of fillings, said Professor Jimmy Steele of Newcastle University.

'A lot of dentists are unhappy about taking out teeth generally. They certainly don't like to take kids' teeth out.'

The number of children aged from zero to four admitted to hospital to have teeth out has also increased, from 8,060 in 2010-11 to a provisional figure of 8,758 in 2013-2014.

Other key findings for children being hospitalised show that one in 20  of girls aged from 15 to 19 being treated by a consultant was as a result of intentional self-harm, while boys were more likely than girls to have been injured in an assault, two per cent. .

Similar differences were also apparent for 10 to 14-year-olds, but they were more pronounced for the older age group. There were more similarities in children up to the age of nine.

There were a total of 2.5 million Finished Consultant Episodes (FCEs) in the 12 month period from July 2012 to June last year for children aged up to 19, a very small increase of 0.1 per cent on the previous 12 months.
