People across the world watched in awe - and horror - as daredevil Felix Baumgartner became the first freefall diver to break the sound barrier after jumping from a balloon 24.5 miles above the Earth.

'Fearless Felix' reached speeds of up to 834 mph before his parachute opened and he landed back on solid ground five minutes later to have completed the highest and fastest skydive in history, one year ago yesterday.

To celebrate the anniversary of the incredible feat, Red Bull has released a video showing multiple views of the jump all at once, including data that lends some perspective to just how fast Mr Baumgartner was plummeting towards our planet.

To celebrate a year and a day since Felix Baumgartner reached speeds of up to 834 mph and completed the highest and fastest skydive in history, Red Bull has released a video showing multiple views of including data that lends some perspective to just how fast Mr Baumgartner was plummeting towards our planet

The video of the Red Bull Stratos jump contains data about the skydive including air speed, g-force, altitude and heart rate.

Mr Baumgartner made his death-defying jump from a tiny capsule that took him up to the edge of space, which took him two-and-a-half hours to travel 128,177ft above the New Mexico desert - and less than ten minutes to land.

He landed on his feet despite moments during the descent that had silenced his mission control as he appeared to lose control and plunge into a head-over-heels spin.

People who watched footage of the jump last year will remember how the daredevil fell to his knees and punched the air in triumph as the control room, packed with scientific experts and family including his teary-eyed mother, Eva, erupted into roars of applause.

Speaking afterwards he said: 'Trust me, when you stand up there on top of the world, you become so humble.

'It's not about breaking records any more. It's not about getting scientific data. The only thing you want is to come back alive.'

During the first part of Mr Baumgartner's free fall, anxious onlookers at the command centre held their breath as he appeared to spin uncontrollably.

'When I was spinning the first 10, 20 seconds, I never thought I was going to lose my life but I was disappointed because I'm going to lose my record. I put seven years of my life into this,' he said.

Speaking after the jump Mr Baumgartner said: 'Trust me, when you stand up there on top of the world, you become so humble. It's not about breaking records any more. It's not about getting scientific data. The only thing you want is to come back alive'

Mr Baumgartner said his Stratos jump has proved that a human can survive accelerating though the sound barrier in freefall and scientists gathered a lot of information, including the first-ever physiologic data from a peron freefalling at supersonic speeds that could be used to inform future projects

He added: 'In that situation, when you spin around, it's like hell and you don't know if you can get out of that spin or not. Of course it was terrifying. I was fighting all the way down because I knew that there must be a moment where I can handle it.'

Red Bull, which sponsored the jump, has also made  a new documentary called RED BULL STRATOS - MISSION TO THE EDGE OF SPACE, to celebrate the anniversary, which is available here.

Mr Baumgartner has revealed this week that he was inspired to do the challenge after watching Joe Kittinger's 19 mile high jump that took place in 1960.

His idol is now Mr Baumgartner's mentor and friend and he told Red Bull: 'The fact that he [Mr Kittinger] survived opened the door to space 
exploration, because it proved a pressure suit could protect a person in
that hostile environment.'

Pilot Mr Baumgartner (pictured after his jump) said his next challenge is more personal in nature as he would like to pilot mountain rescue and help to fight wildfires by flying helicopters - completing his other childhood dream

Mr Baumgartner said his Stratos jump has proved that a human can survive accelerating though the sound barrier in freefall and scientists gathered a lot of information, including the first-ever physiologic data from a peron freefalling at supersonic speeds that could be used to inform future projects.

'It's incredibly useful for those who are exploring how people might be able to bail out of aircraft at ultra-high altitudes,' he said.

Mr Baumgartner said his next challenge is more personal in nature as he would like to pilot mountain rescue and help to fight wildfires by flying helicopters - completing his other childhood dream.

He said: I think future adventures are for the next generation to envision; but people are definitely looking toward new horizons in space. That’s why government and private aerospace organizations have been interested in the mission data we’ve been sharing. They can build on what we learned for future exploration.'
