Robin van Persie returns to Premier League action on Monday amid accusations that a bust-up with international strike partner Klaas-Jan Huntelaar could cost Holland a place at Euro 2016.

That’s the view of former Dutch captain Ruud Gullit, who saw Van Persie and Huntelaar screaming at each other during the 3-1 qualifying win over Kazakhstan, Holland’s sole win so far between defeats by Czech Republic and Iceland.

The two frontmen have rarely got on and no longer speak to each other. But Gullit is convinced Van Persie, who has been labelled a troublemaker before, will not cause problems for Louis van Gaal at United, who take on West Brom on Monday.

That is according to Ruud Gullit, who says the bust-up could mean they don't make Euro 2016

Van Gaal, who guided Holland to third place at last summer’s World Cup, made it clear to Huntelaar in Brazil that Van Persie was his first-choice striker and Gullit said: ‘Louis van Gaal got everyone quiet again and made the team work for Van Persie. All he wanted was other players to serve the right balls to Van Persie. 

'With the help of Arjen Robben, who was brilliant, Holland got to third in the World Cup. But the problems have far from disappeared. Against Kazakhstan, Huntelaar was mouthing off again and the old confrontation with Van Persie came back to the surface.’

United fans must be praying that Van Persie’s Dutch feuds are forgotten now he has returned to his club and former national boss. There were rumours last season that Van Persie and David Moyes, Van Gaal’s predecessor, had a bust-up over the Scot’s training regime. After Moyes was sacked he made a point of thanking the United staff but not the players, who he felt let him down.

Louis van Gaal built a team around Van Persie, somewhat neglecting Huntelaar

Van Gaal, meanwhile, has warned injured and suspended players they face a fight to win their places back. United beat Everton 2-1 before the international break without 10 players, including Michael Carrick, Phil Jones and Wayne Rooney.

Some are available to return against West Brom, though Rooney is still serving a three-match ban, but Van Gaal warned: ‘Nobody is walking back in my team, believe me. You have to earn it on the training ground. Every player knows that.’
