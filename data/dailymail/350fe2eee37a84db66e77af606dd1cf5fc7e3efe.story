It is one of the most moving scenes in Gravity, in which a desperate Sandra Bullock shares her fears of death with a disembodied foreign voice hundreds of miles away.

Now, a seven-minute short film has been released showing the other side of that mayday phone call and it could be in the running for an Oscar.

The film shows Inuit Aningaaq speaking over the radio to Bullock's fearful character, Ryan Stone.

Aningaaq shows the other side of a desperate radio conversation Sandra Bullock's character has from space in Gravity. It follows the Inuit as he hears her distress call while he is in a remote Greenland fjord

The beautiful seven-minute short film has been submitted for Academy Award consideration and if both Aningaaq and Gravity are nominated it will be the first time two separate films from the same source material have been in contention in the same year

Despite not being able to speak each other's language, the pair talk about their heartache and their worries.

Both Gravity, which has so far grossed $500million, and the short, called Aningaaq, use the same conversation but show the other point of view.

It was funded by Warner Home Video and 
intended as an extra feature on the Blu-ray release of Gravity but it 
now could be nominated for an Oscar after exceeding expectations.

It has been submitted for consideration in the live-action short category of the Academy Awards.

If successful, Aningaaq and 'parent film' Gravity could become the first feature length and short film based on the same material to be nominated for an Oscar in the same year.

The short film shows what Aningaaq was saying back to Sandra Bullock's Ryan Stone

Aningaaq was directed by Jonas Cuaron, son of Gravity director Alfonso Cuaron and also the co-writer of the blockbuster's screenplay.

It shows the fisherman, played by Greenlander Orto Ignatiussen, hearing Ryan Stone's mayday call from space but failing to understand what she is saying.

Instead he tells her about his love for one of his dogs, which is sick and dying, and how he should kill her but cannot bear to.

In Gravity, Stone pictures a happy scene as she listens to the dogs bark and hears Aningaaq sing a lullaby to his restless baby.

Gravity, starring Bullock and George Clooney, has now grossed more than $500million

However, the short shows the viewer that, like Stone, Aningaaq is also in a lonely harsh environment, struggling for survival.

Jonas Cuaron told The Hollywood Reporter he had the idea when travelling through Greenland and speaking to locals about their love for their sled dogs.

It is set in a remote Greenland fjord and cost just $100,000 to make.

Jonas Cuaron told THR: 'It's this moment where the audience and the character get this hope that Ryan is finally going to be OK.

'Then you realize that everything gets lost in translation.'
