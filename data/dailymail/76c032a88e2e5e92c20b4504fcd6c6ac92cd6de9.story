Kate Bosworth is known for her keen sense of style, and her diamond wedding band is no exception.

The 30-year-old actress, who has her own jewelry label called JewelMint, shared details of the platinum ring with Us Weekly on Wednesday.

Her band was a custom design created by online jeweler Ocappi, and was inspired by her Art Deco engagement ring.

The band holds a hidden meaning too. 'We wanted to create a wedding band that incorporated 12 of these diamond baguettes for each month of the year,' Ms Bosworth said of the ring, which is horizontally laden with oblong-cut diamonds.

Ms Bosworth's new husband Michael Polish, who she wed in an intimate ceremony on Saturday, also has a wedding band of a similar design.

'We are amazed at the level of execution of a design this unique,' she told Us Weekly of the couple's excitement over their matrimonial jewelry. 'Because this is a ring worn every day, it is essential that it reflects our personal aesthetic.'

Ocappi's creative director, Haki Abehsera, is equally as infatuated with Bosworth. 'Collaborating with Kate was so wonderful, because she has such a great style sense that it made the creative process so vivid,' she told Us.

'She expressed how much she loved her engagement ring and how she wanted something to accompany it without taking too much attention away from it.'

The couple hosted approximately 
seventy guests at their Montana wedding over the weekend. The bride wore
two custom-made Oscar de la Renta gowns for the occasion.

Vogue
magazine went inside the actress's fittings with de la Renta and posted
videos to its website. The videos provide a look at the 30-year-old's 
emotional reaction when she saw herself in her gown for the first time.

'Seeing the dress I was totally shocked at my complete lack of control over my emotions in that moment,' she said.

'It's
a dress that reflects the love I have for my partner, it's a reflection
on my life, it's a reflection on the woman I've become.'

The two videos, one from a toile 
fitting, and one with the finished dress, offer a detailed look at the 
actress's dramatic gown, and tell the story of how it came to be.

'Because I love minimalism and I love a 
clean line so much, I knew that I didnâ€™t want any embellishments in the 
dress,' Ms Bosworth said. 'So I spoke to Oscar [and] he loved the idea about 
having the drama in the back. So I knew that was going to be perfect.'

The result was an overwhelming success.

Making changes: The length of the train, which is 8ft long and 16ft wide, was a later decision - an idea that came about during the toile fitting

'I love the dress because when you see the front, it feels so 
minimal then when you turn around there's just this dramatic sort of 
glorious fall of the fabric,' the actress says. 'There's just so much poetry and elegance to it.'

At the final fitting for her dress, 
Ms Bosworth also selected her accessories from a vintage-look selection 
by jeweler Stephen Russell.

'Because
my dress is so restrained and has such a minimal feel to it, I thought,
oh the embellishment should really shine, and the jewelry,' she said. 'Still in a 
subtle way so that the look is fluid. . . It 
was really difficult to choose because they're all so beautiful.'

The couple's matched taste in jewelry is not the only synergy that they share.

'The moment I met Michael, I knew 
that he was the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with,' Ms Bosworth said.

'We're best friends and great partners and I just found my match in this 
life - and so every detail in the wedding is a reflection of our union.'

The pair met when he directed Kate in the drama Big Sur in 2011 and the actress has admitted that it was love at first sight.

Talking
to InStyle earlier this year, Kate revealed: 'I never even dated my 
husband-to-be. . . He said to me after just a few weeks before we were 
even together, "I'm going to marry you." He just knew.'

Wedding guests included actress Lake Bell, Oscar-winning actor-and-producer Walton Goggins and Michael's twin brother Mark Polish.

The four-day celebration was snapped 
by photographer John Dolan and the wedding will be featured in the 
Winter issue of Martha Stewart Weddings.
