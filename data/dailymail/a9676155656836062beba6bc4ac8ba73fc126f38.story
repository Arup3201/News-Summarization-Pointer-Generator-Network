The number of Britons going online has doubled since 2006 and almost half of the 33 million current UK internet users use social networks on a daily basis, new figures show. 

People in the UK were also found to be the second most prolific social network users in Europe - being beaten only by the Netherlands - according to figures from the latest report by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Eurostat.

The figures also discovered that although the majority of UK users are aged between 16 and 24 years old, 19 per cent of people aged 65 to 74 now use social networks.

The Office for National Statistics and Eurostat have studied the number of people across Europe who are using social networks. The Netherlands tops the group at 65 per cent with the UK in second place, making up more than half - 57 per cent - of European social network users

The way you use Facebook and Twitter could mirror how narcissistic you are, according to a new university study.

Research by the University of Michigan examined how social media websites reflect a growing culture of narcissism in the US.

Scientists
 found that middle-aged narcissists are more likely to frequently update
 their Facebook status, while their younger counterparts take to Twitter
 to satisfy their vanity.

According to the study, Twitter acts as a megaphone for younger web users.

As well as tracking internet use across Europe during 2012, the report also looked into how many people are accessing social networks from their mobile devices.

The Opinions and Lifestyle survey is a monthly, face-to-face
 survey carried out by the ONS.

It samples around 2,010 adults in Great Britain each month and every year, between January and March, a section is included looking at internet use.

According to the most recent report, almost half of all adults in the UK - 48 per cent - used social networking sites in 2012.

Around two thirds - 62 per cent - of adults aged  35 to 55 use social networks to communicate online.

While 40 per cent of adults aged 45 to 54 are now using social networks regularly.

A fifth of 65 to 74 year olds surveyed by the ONS and Eurostat said they used social networks on a daily basis. In younger age groups, the highest proportion of 16 to 24 years olds using these social sites from mobile devices was found in Sweden at 40 per cent

As part of the 2012 Internet Access section, participants were asked about which activities they used the internet for, in the three months prior to their interview.

One of the responses was 'Social networking, using websites e.g. Facebook or Twitter'.

Analysis of the responses found that there was no difference in the use of social networking by men and women.

However, there was a marked difference in use between age groups.

In general, the proportion of adults recently using social networks decreased with age.

In the 16 to 24 age group, 90 per cent of respondents used social networks in the three months before their interview.

Yet 19 per cent of the 65 and over age group also selected this response.

Within the EU the UK ranked second behind the Netherlands for social networking. Over half -  57 per cent - of UK adults reported that they had used social networks in the three months prior to the survey. This is compared to 65 per cent of Dutch people using social networks

Internet use figures were then collected across 
Europe by Eurostat, so these UK findings could be compared to international use.

Eurostat's findings were slightly broader than the UK's because it defined social network use as ‘posting messages to chat sites, 
social networking sites, blogs, newsgroups, discussion forums and the 
use of Instant Messaging (IM)’.

Within the EU the UK ranked second behind the Netherlands for 
social networking.

Over half -  57 per cent - of UK adults reported that they had used 
social networks in the three months prior to the survey.

This is compared to 65 per cent of Dutch people using social networks, and 55 per cent of Swedish residents sat in third.

According to the current ONS report, recent growth in social networking can 'partly be explained by increasing mobile Internet use in Great Britain.' In 2012, just over half - 52 per cent - of all adults used a mobile device to access the Internet and, of these, 63 per cent accessed social networks

In 2012 the UK was placed second out of all EU countries accessing social networks from mobile devices. Sweden topped the group with the highest proportion of adults - 40 per cent - using these social sites on the go

By
 further comparison, the U.S. Census Bureau reported in May 2011 that half of all adults in the United States used 'social networking sites like 
MySpace, Facebook or LinkedIn.

According to the current ONS report, recent growth in social networking can 'partly be explained by increasing mobile Internet use in Great Britain.'

In 2012, just over half - 52 per cent - of all adults used a mobile device to access the internet and, of these 63 per cent accessed social networks.

The term 'mobile' in this context refers to any mobile or smart phone, PDA, MP3 player, e-book reader or handheld game console.

It did not include tablet computers.

In 2012, the UK was placed second out of
 all EU countries accessing social networks from mobile devices.

Sweden topped the group this time with the highest proportion of adults - 40 per cent - using these social sites on the go.

As with overall internet use, social networking on a mobile device in Europe was most popular with the younger age groups.

Approximately
 seven out of 10 adults used mobile devices for accessing social networks in
 the 16 to 24 age group, while just 1 in 100 of those aged 65 and over 
did so.   

Looking 
specifically at those aged 16 to 24, the UK has the joint fifth highest 
proportion of social networkers in the EU - at 90 per cent.

The Netherlands topped the group again, with 97 per cent of Dutch 16 to 24-year-olds using social networks.

This was followed by Sweden, Slovenia and Portugal on 92 per cent.

However, there were marked differences across the EU when accessing social 
networks via a mobile device.

In 2012 there was a very low take up of 
social networking via a mobile in Romania, Bulgaria and the Czech 
Republic where the proportions were all less than 5 per cent.

The UK data was taken from England, Scotland and Wales but not Northern Ireland.
