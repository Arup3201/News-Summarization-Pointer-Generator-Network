One is a multimillionaire glamour model with a talent for controversy and a penchant for of plastic surgery. The other is the Duchess of Cornwall.

Yet despite their very different lives, Camilla and Katie appeared to get along famously when they bumped into each other on day two of the Cheltenham Festival.

Ms Price, who is an equine enthusiast herself, looked very much at ease during her brush with royalty and wore an unusually toned-down ensemble of white jeans and a neat navy jacket.

Camilla, meanwhile, was on cheerful form and looked wonderful in a Scottish Balmoral tweed suit by couturier Roy Allan and a matching hat by milliner Lock. 

The Duchess had been making her way back from the paddock, where she presented jockey Sam Twiston-Davies with his trophy after he won the Betway Queen Mother Champion Chase on Dodging Bullets, when she bumped into Ms Price and her friends.

When asked by  for a picture, the Duchess was all smiles and gamely obliged, with daughter Laura Lopes also getting into the frame.

Camilla's foray into the paddock also resulted in a second celebrity encounter, when the Duchess found herself enjoying a chat with Gloucestershire local, Jilly Cooper.

Ms Cooper, who is famous for novels documenting country life, is no stranger to the world of racing having made it the subject of her most recent book, Jump!

Another of her equine-themed page turners, horse box-trembling bonkbuster Riders, celebrated its 30th birthday this week and remains one of the UK's favourite novels.

Indeed, the Duchess is no stranger to Cooper's oeuvre, with the author once admitting that showjumping cad Rupert Campbell-Black is partially based on Camilla's ex-husband, Andrew Parker-Bowles.

Until her star-studded encounters in the paddock, Camilla had been enjoying a family day out in the royal box with her two children, Tom and Laura, and their spouses Harry Lopes and Sara Parker-Bowles.

Also at the races was Zara Tindall who returned to the racecourse for a second day and looked lovely in black and white coat and matching black cocktail hat by milliner Rosie Olivia.

The Parker-Bowles quartet had arrived at the racecourse together and happily posed for photos before Mail On Sunday food critic Tom got to work sampling the stout sold at a nearby stall.

Camilla, meanwhile, had arrived alone and was at the racecourse with work to do, having been asked to present the prize to the winner of the Betway Queen Mother Champion Chase - Mr Twiston-Davies and Dodging Bullets.

The Duchess also did the honours last year and was asked to return by Cheltenham chairman, Robert Waley-Cohen. 'I am delighted that The Duchess of Cornwall will again be attending this year's Festival on Ladies Day,' he said.

'The scenes in the Winner's Enclosure after Sire De Grugy won the Betway Queen Mother Champion Chase were some of the best of the week and this year's race is shaping up to be as competitive as ever.'

Camilla, who has long loved horses, was also there to promote her six equestrian charities, among them The British Equestrian Federation, The Brooke Hospital for Animals and Ebony Horse Club. 

Like her mother-in-law, the Queen, the Duchess is also a racing enthusiast and is a regular visitor to Royal Ascot as well as other race meetings.

The Duchess has been having a busy week, which began with a trip to Westminster Abbey for the Commonwealth Day Observance service with Prince Charles.

Yesterday, she helped to launch the Big Lunch 2015 campaign with a reception at her London home, Clarence House. The campaign, which is run by the Eden Project, aims to encourage people to 'do lunch' and get to know their neighbours.

During the reception, Camilla was introduced to campaign workers and, much to her delight, was presented with a bunch of Welsh daffodils and a gift of Welsh cakes by 11-year-old Marcus Aitken.

But while all eyes might have been on the unlikely pairing of Camilla and Katie Price, the royals weren't the only ones to look glamorous on Ladies Day at Cheltenham.

With a £15,000 prize to win, scores of women turned up in their finest frocks for the event, with many topping off their look with some out-of-this world millinery.

Everything from huge floppy fedoras to glamorous little cocktail numbers adorned the tops of perfectly-coiffed heads, while shoes ranged from sky-high platforms to comfortable country boots. 

Not everyone opted for brights, however, with several ladies also following Camilla's example and opting for cosy tweed ensembles topped with brushed fur cossack hats.

Many racegoers  opted for bold hats in an array of bright colours

Whatever they wore, the crowds certainly appeared to enjoy their day and as the racing drew to a close, they headed towards the bars for a warming drink before they headed home.

Hundreds of guests made their way to the Moët & Chandon tent, to stock up on mini bottles of champagne, with many making the most of specially-designed plastic funnels. 

Introduced by the champagne brand to make sipping from the bottle less hazardous to clothes, the funnels also dispensed with the need for plastic glasses, leaving the racecourse staff with less work to do once the crowds departed.

Some, however, couldn't resist doing things the traditional way and nipped back to the car park to plunder the supermarket-bought bottles of prosecco that they had been storing in the boot.  

After the racing ended, women headed in their droves to the Moët & Chandon champagne bar
