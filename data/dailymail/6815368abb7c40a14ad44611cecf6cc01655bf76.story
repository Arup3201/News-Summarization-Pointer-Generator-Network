Officers working on Operation Yewtree - the police probe sparked by disgraced DJ Jimmy Savile - have earned almost half a million pounds overtime.

The cost is in addition to the £2.2million basic bill for the operation, which has led to the arrests of a string of high profile stars.

Campaign group, the Taxpayers' Alliance, has labeled the overtime costs - racked up in just ten months -  'scandalously large'.

Operation Yewtree is the national investigation prompted after claims were made against disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Savile.

Scotland Yard has led the probe, and separated its inquiries into those involving Savile, those involving Savile and others, and those involving others.

It confirmed to The Sun: 'The total cost of Operation Yewtree from October 2012, its start date, to the end of August 2013 is £2,754,680 of which £490,000 is overtime'.

Robert Oxley, Campaign Director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'A scandalous amount of expensive overtime has been taken up by this investigation, despite its importance.

'It’s vital the police thoroughly investigate these horrific crimes that were ignored for far too long, however it's important that they are vigilant about how much they are spending.

'Police chiefs involved in this important investigation must get a grip on spending and make sure that overtime is kept to a minimum.'

Entertainer Rolf Harris, former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis and PR consultant Max Clifford are among the high profile figures already arrested and charged with sex offences following Operation Yewtree.

They all deny wrongdoing.

Comedian Jim Davidson, who was arrested in January, learned in the summer that he would not be charged.

Paul Gambaccini last week admitted he was the latest celebrity to be arrested by detectives investigating the Savile scandal.

Fellow entertainer Freddie Starr remains on police bail, as prosecutors decide whether to charge him.

Former pop star Gary Glitter is also waiting to learn his fate after his arrest.

Gambaccini was the 15th suspect to be arrested under Operation Yewtree.

Police confirmed another man, aged 74, was arrested as part of the investigation.

Both men have been bailed to a date in early January.
