Beautiful women and handsome men dance around a set of London town in their flexible yet stylish Burberry macs, accompanied by guardsmen in bearskins and an angelic boy who just happens to be Romeo Beckham, probably the only famous 12-year-old in Britain. Little expense has been spared in the Burberry Christmas advert.

And why not? The brand has unquestionably become Britain’s premier luxury label, its only superbrand. With its designer Christopher Bailey at the helm as CEO, Burberry is London's answer to Chanel.

Its fashion shows have become the biggest, starriest event at London fashion week. Even in a weakening market for luxury goods, revenues rose seven per cent in the past six months to more than £1 billion.

Back in style: Romeo Beckham wears the £315 'icon' cashmere scarf in Burberry’s distinctive camel, black, white and red check

Back in 2002, the design had been dubbed 'chav check' after it was embraced by far from A-list stars like actress Danniella Westbrook

Back in 2009, shares hovered below 600p — now they are around 1,400p. Kate Middleton, Gwyneth Paltrow and Keira Knightley are among the stars who wear Burberry — the deluxe, catwalk Burberry Prorsum line, the rainwear and bags.

In the current advert, Romeo Beckham wears the £315 ‘icon’ cashmere scarf in Burberry’s distinctive camel, black, white and red check. Hard to believe that it was only a decade ago that the brand seemed in crisis and that check was less icon, more albatross. Far too widespread for its own good, it had become known as ‘chav check’.

Immediately recognisable — and affordable, on items such as a £50 baseball cap — it was accessible luxury that became far too accessible. Worse still, it was easy to copy and spawned an industry of counterfeits.

Real or fake, it was on everything from bikinis to bags, favoured by football hooligans and — most spectacularly — worn head to toe (including toddler and buggy) by EastEnders actress Danniella Westbrook in 2002.

It is hard to remember another single photograph doing a brand so much damage. In the words of social commentator Peter York, author of the Official Sloane Ranger Handbook: ‘It was associated with people who did bad stuff, who went wild on the terraces. Quite a lot of people thought that Burberry would be worn by the person who mugged them.’ Some venues banned anyone wearing it, so entrenched was its association with anti-social behaviour.

It had come a very long way from its respectable beginnings

Yet how ironic it is that the brand’s slow limp back to respectability has been matched, step-for-step by the very family whose pint-sized representative is being seen as a symbol of salvation.

Not so long ago Romeo’s mother Victoria Beckham, although not viewed with quite as much derision as Danniella Westbrook, was far from being a fashion icon. A WAG and popstar known for her fake tan, fake breasts and fake hair extensions she was the very sort of person Burberry didn’t want to wear its merchandise.

Now named Britain’s top entrepreneur, with a style that’s more Vogue than football terrace, the choice of her son to front the Burberry Christmas campaign is fitting indeed.

The brand was founded by Thomas Burberry, teetotaller and devout Baptist, in 1856. He went on to invent gabardine, the waterproof fabric that revolutionised rainwear. Roald Amundsen went to the South Pole and Ernest Shackleton to Antarctica, in Burberry.

Then the War Office commissioned the company to design the ‘trench coat’, worn by officers in World War I. In an early case of celebrity endorsement, Lord Kitchener declared himself a fan and civilians started wearing them after the war.

Burberry made aviation-wear and skiwear but remained a quiet London firm until Rose Marie Bravo, an American executive, took over in 1997. She raised its profile, expanded into America, commissioned an advertising campaign starring Kate Moss in 1999 and, most significantly of all, hired Christopher Bailey on the design team in 2001.

By now it was at the height of its ‘chav’ popularity, most pertinently illustrated by the Danniella Westbrook overload. The brand had become a victim of its own success.

In luxury, ubiquity is the death knell; luxury is exclusive or it isn’t luxury at all.

The idea of anyone being able to resuscitate that check into anything remotely desirable seemed as likely as Burberry opening a shop on the moon. It was vulgar, vulgar, vulgar.

But the firm refused to admit defeat. Steps were taken to stop the rot — the caps went out of production, and the use of check was reduced across the board. In 2004 Bailey was promoted to Creative Director. Burberry was becoming a more serious player.

In 2006, a turning point came in the form of another American CEO with an impressive CV, Angela Ahrendts. She arrived and, together with Bailey, performed the remarkable feat of carving out a strategy to move Burberry firmly back off the backs of the undesirables into the ‘hot’ zone, using a combination of design skill, marketing savvy and business sense.

Even now, the fashion set are still in awe of how they turned things round. One leading magazine editor told me: ‘It’s very hard to know quite how Bailey does it. He runs a design team, a huge company — most fashion brands are like that — and he edits it all.

‘Like Tom Ford, for whom he worked at Gucci, he knows the importance of being on message and on brand. The shows bang one point home again and again — 70 girls wearing the same thing. It’s about one big idea. Plus, the models are acceptably, immediately appealing, like the music he chooses. Or Romeo Beckham. He’s really good at marketing.’

The answer seems to lie in the fusion of design and business strategy. In the bad old days, due to complicated global licensing, different stores in the world sold a whole load of different products, at different prices, adding up to what Ahrendts called ‘just a lot of stuff’.

Companies she admired such as Starbucks and Apple (where she is now a senior vice president) offered the same experience in any store. She decided to ‘centralise the design’ under Christopher Bailey, who became Chief Creative Officer in 2009. From then on every single design decision was to be approved by him.

This ‘control freak’ philosophy meant that the Willy-Wonka-ish figure of Bailey could prevail in all areas of his fabulous fashion factory. Son of a carpenter and an M&S window dresser, Bailey is a famously polite, softly-spoken Yorkshireman with an iron will and a sharp sense for the vagaries of fashion, in fabrics, hemlines, or mood. After his promotion, every new Burberry shop offered the same stock, at the same price. The store design — mirrors, warm wood, videos — was uniform.

He decided to concentrate on the brand’s heritage, or the good bits, anyway. The check was further reduced. Burberry would do what it did best: trench coats.

They would also come home. The company moved its fashion shows back to London from Milan in 2009 and became a giant fish in a smaller pond, a move that gave it a clearer identity and more publicity. So far so good.

But vitally, there were two more strands to the brand’s resurgence. Digital innovation, and wearability.

Bailey has the golden gift of knowing just what will take off on the streets, and spreads the word.

It wasn’t just that they were the first brand to live-stream their fashion shows in 2010, or to let customers order from the runway, or to garner followers on social media. It was that they deliberately targeted what Ahrendts called ‘millennials’ — young customers — because they believed their competitors were ignoring them.

The youth drive was important because in emerging markets such as China, the age of the luxury goods consumer is much lower than it is in the UK. But it had a happy side-effect. Rather than alienating the older, more traditional customer in the West, it ensured they perceived the brand as edgy and exciting.

One of the many mysteries of fashion is that you would think an expensive luxury brand, which wants to sell to the highly lucrative 40 and 50-something market, would make sure that it offers clothes that are not too short, or too revealing. Bafflingly, most designer fashion labels miss this obvious fact.

But part of Bailey’s brilliance was that while there was always enough edge — sharp leather jackets, buckles, trims, glimmery fabric — his clothes didn’t frighten the horses.

Like Karl Lagerfeld’s designs for Chanel, Burberry offered high fashion that almost any middle-class, middle-aged woman could wear. They never neglected the core customer — in London, a busy, affluent 30 to 60-year-old woman or man.

Expansion continued apace, more stores opened with well-trained staff; online sold bespoke trench coats in endless varieties; Burberry Beauty was launched.

This year, as Ahrendts departed for Apple, Bailey became CEO as well as Chief Creative Officer. His first Christmas advert seems sure-footed and accessible. It a sign of Bailey’s supreme confidence that even the once-dreaded check is back in the game.

No wonder Romeo Beckham is dancing. He represents sweet victory after a chequered history.
