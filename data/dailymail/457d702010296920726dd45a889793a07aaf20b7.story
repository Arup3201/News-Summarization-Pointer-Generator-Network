Child killer Mark Bridger - convicted murderer of schoolgirl April Jones - has reportedly launched a bid for compensation after he was attacked in jail

Child killer Mark Bridger - convicted murderer of schoolgirl April Jones - has reportedly launched a bid for compensation after he was attacked in jail by another inmate.

It has been revealed he could be paid as much as £15,000 after he was slashed with a razor.

The parents of the murdered five-year-old look set to receive just £11,000 in compensation for their daughter's death. 

Juvinai Ferreira, 22, pleaded guilty to wounding Bridger, 47, with a makeshift knife in Wakefield Prison, in July.

The Sun reports that Bridger has informed his lawyers he wants a payout for the 'emotional and physical distress' he suffered after the attack.

He is not believed to have outlined a set amount, but similar cases have been awarded £15,000 in compensation.

But April's parents Paul and Coral Jones can expect a maximum of £5,500 each for their own distress.

Mrs Jones, 41, told the paper: 'It's disgusting that Bridger could get money after what he has done. Where's he going to spend it anyway?'

Father-of-six Bridger snatched 
April near her home in Machynlleth. He was given a whole-life tariff by a
judge in May at Mold Crown Court. The five-year-old's body has never 
been found.

A Prison Service spokeswoman said it 'robustly defends' all compensation claims from prisoners.

Ferreira attacked the 47-year-old just months after Bridger was jailed for life for abducting and murdering April, in Machynlleth, Wales last year.

According
to reports at the time of the attack, which happened on July 7, Bridger
needed hospital treatment to a face wound after he was slashed with the
makeshift knife.

Juvinai Ferreira used a makeshift knife to attack the 47-year-old at Wakefield Prison, West Yorkshire, in July

He was returned to Wakefield after his injury was stitched.

Judge Batty told Ferreira he needed a pre-sentence report to assess his level of dangerousness and decide whether a second life term was appropriate.

Ferreira was found guilty at Norwich Crown Court in 2009 of murdering Elaine Walpole in Dereham, Norfolk, in April 2008.

At the time police said Ferreira moved to Dereham in 2007 with a relative after escaping civil war in Africa.

He befriended 47-year-old Miss Walpole, an alcoholic who lived alone, after they met at a shop and she bought him cigarettes.

Post-mortem tests showed that Miss Walpole, a former hotel worker who had three children, had been stabbed three times and bitten.

Detectives and forensic experts spent nearly a year carrying out checks to show Ferreira was an adult as he said he was 16.

Once it was proved he was an adult, Ferreira was given a life sentence and told he must serve at least 22 years before being considered for parole.
