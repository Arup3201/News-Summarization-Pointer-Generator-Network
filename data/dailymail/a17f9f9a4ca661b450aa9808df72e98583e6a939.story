A bride who was left paralysed by a rare nerve condition made a miraculous recovery after she became determined to walk down the aisle unassisted.

Victoria Royle, 29, was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome and told by doctors she might be confined to a wheelchair for life.

Her family watched on as she was left frozen in her own body, unable to move, swallow, or even breathe unassisted as the illness  - which affects only one in 50,000 people in the UK - took hold.

Victoria Royle, left paralysed by a rare nerve condition amde a full recovery and walked down the aisle to meet her husband-to-be Nick

Despite only having been with her 
boyfriend, Nick, 27, a professional rugby player, for a month when she 
was first taken ill, he stuck by her, providing her with round the clock care.

It was when he proposed that Victoria, who works as a hospital assistant,  was determined to regain the ability in her legs.

She said: 'Being stuck in a chair for the rest of 
my life wasn't an option for me.

'When Nick later proposed, I was 
determined to walk down the aisle without a zimmer frame.'

Guillain-Barre syndrome simulates a nerve cell, causing the body to 
attack its own nervous system as it fights the infection and can cause 
paralysis and even death.

Within 48 hours of noticing the first symptoms, which include a numbing sensation in the arms and legs, Victoria was admitted to Whiston Hospital, Merseyside, and was immediately transferred to intensive care.

Victoria said: 'I was locked in my 
body - I couldn't move, couldn't communicate - and the pain was so bad.

Guillain-Barré (pronounced Ghee-lan Bar-ray) syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the peripheral nervous system

Named after two of three French doctors who first described the condition in 1916, Georges Charles Guillain and Jean-Alexander Barré

Leads to a tingly, numbing sensation in the arms and legs

Can eventually result in a short-term loss of feeling and movement (temporary paralysis)

Exact cause is unclear. and there no way of identifying who is most at risk.

Affects about 1,500 people in the UK every year

Most people (about 8 out of 10) make a full recovery within a few weeks or months, and do not have any further problems

'I thought I was going to die and not 
be able to tell my family how much I loved them.'

After eight weeks of battling the 
condition, Victoria made a miraculous recovery and was allowed to go home, with the warning she may never come out of her wheelchair.

But after months of physiotherapy, Victoria eventually managed to take her first steps, with the help of a walking stick and eventually was able to walk unaided.

As the couple, from Widnes, Cheshire, 
struggled to save for the wedding because of the time they had taken off
work - they applied to go on BBC3's Don't Tell 
The Bride - the reality show where the groom plans the wedding in three 
weeks - without any input from the bride, but is given £12,000 to blow 
on the big day.

Victoria added: 'My wedding day was 
perfect - it was so emotional walking down the aisle, when two years 
earlier, I didn't know if I'd ever walk again.

'Nick has been my rock and I feel like the luckiest woman in the world to have him and my health.'

A spokesperson from the Guillain-Barre syndrome support group said: 'Guillain-Barre syndrome is a rare 
condition, only one in 50,000 people in the UK will suffer from it, and 
many of those will experience nothing more than pins and needles in 
their fingers and toes.

'However, in some cases, the syndrome
does develop further, and in 25 per cent of cases, patients will be 
hospitalised and put on a ventilator.'
