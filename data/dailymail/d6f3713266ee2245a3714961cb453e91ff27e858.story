The pages of high society magazine Tatler are not the first place one might expect to encounter a list rating women's breasts.

But that is exactly what the May issue of the world's oldest magazine has to offer. And some of the women featured in the list - as well as a number of the magazine's readers - have come out to express horror at what they say is a 'misogynistic' article.

The three-page spread on 'the most magnificent, marvellous breasts in all society', features 34 famous women praised only for their 't**s'.

Respected presenter Clare Balding appears on the list, along with Nigella Lawson and Princess Eugenie. Alice Dellal, Pixie Geldof and Helen 
Mirren all feature topless in the Titler feature, dubbed 
Brazilian T**s, Pierced T**s and Theatrical T**s respectively.

Mensch first tweeted: 'So, Tatler with lead feature "Titler: Big Society Tits". Please don't edit magazines drunk' before posting a picture of the spread

Ex-MP Louise Mensch, dubbed Tweeting T**s, took to Twitter to express her outrage. Princess Eugenie, is named Royal T**s

Ex-MP Louise Mensch, dubbed Tweeting Tits by the magazine, took to Twitter to express her outrage.

Using the hashtag 'feminism', she slammed the magazine's 'misogynistic' feature saying, 'Yeah, thanks for that, Pratler Magazine'.

Since the issue's release aÂ Facebook 
page and Twitter account, called No to Titler at Tatler, have been set up in protest against the feature.

They say: 'Tell Tatler - characterising respected women's 't**s' is demeaning, degrading and will not be tolerated!'

The May issue of Tatler has come under fire

They group claim professional gambler Victoria Coren, or 
'Bluestocking T**s' according to Tatler, is to email a 
complaint to the magazine's editor.

'All hail Victoria,' they say, adding that Victoria's agent 'confirmed to the campaign that she will be emailing the magazine's editor on the Titler feature'.

However a source has confirmed Victoria has actually not seen the piece.

She has commented, saying: 'I'm sure it's done in a spirit of humour; I don't want to disappoint anyone who's genuinely offended but I'm utterly committed to a free Press.

'Tatler is a refreshingly mischievous magazine; if that's stirred up a bit of public debate, then our culture sounds good and healthy to me!'

Other respected names included in the article are Sophie
Dahl, daughter of children's author Roald, labelled BFG T**s and Golden Globe nominee Romola Garai, named Telly 
T**s.

Cambridge graduate, top model and 
charity campaigner Lily Cole is labelled Ginger T**s alongside a 
photograph of her at a red carpet event.

The magazine, which faces accusations of dumbing down, also features naked breasts on two fashion spreads in this month's issue.
