Britain was yesterday ranked the eighth best country in the world in which to do business – but continues to be held back by high taxes, red tape and debt.

The World Economic Forum – which organises the annual Davos gathering of global leaders – said the UK was up from 10th last year and was now ‘firmly back’ at the top table.

It was the highest ranking of the century and follows decades of decline under Labour, as rising taxes, stifling bureaucracy and ballooning debts damaged business and pushed Britain down to as low as 15th in the competitiveness league table.

‘The United Kingdom continues to make up lost ground in the rankings this year, rising two more places and now settling firmly back in the top 10,’ said the WEF in its Global Competitiveness Report.

The Treasury welcomed the report as proof that government reforms, including cutting corporation tax and relaxing planning laws, were having an impact.

But the WEF warned that Britain’s economic situation remained grim and said the world faced ‘a long period of economic uncertainty’ as the debt crisis in the eurozone raged.

It said the ‘macroeconomic environment’ – the general state of the economy – was weak, with the UK falling from 85th place last year to 110th out of 144.

And the report raised particular concerns over government finances, with Britain’s budget ranked 137th in the world – meaning only seven countries were worse off.

The UK fared worse than Sierra Leone, the Ivory Coast and Spain but better than Greece, the United States and Ireland.

The WEF, which scores each country according to 12 ‘pillars of competitiveness’, said ‘the most problematic factors for doing business’ in Britain included ‘access to finance’ – a crisis highlighted by the Daily Mail’s Make The Banks Lend campaign.

Other problems were tax rates and regulations, government bureaucracy, an inadequately educated workforce, poor infrastructure, burdensome employment laws and a weak work ethic among staff.

The report will pile pressure on the government – and the apparently business-friendly junior ministers appointed in this week’s reshuffle – to improve Britain’s competitiveness and drive growth.

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The Government’s reforms are supporting the UK becoming more competitive, such as creating a more flexible and educated workforce, simplifying our tax system, and reducing the main rate of corporation tax – as well as scrapping burdensome regulation and simplifying planning rules.’

Switzerland came top of the WEF world rankings, with Singapore in second place and Finland in third.
