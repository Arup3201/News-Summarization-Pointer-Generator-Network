It is not unusual for sisters to look to each other for fashion tips and advice about what to wear.

And from the looks of her outfit at a friend's wedding, Pippa Middleton has been listening closely to the words of her older sister.

Royal watchers might have noticed an air of familiarity in Pippa's fashionable choice that she wore yesterday to the Scottish wedding of close friend Camilla Hook to Indian Ocean tsunami survivor Sam Holland, the actor grandson of Oscar-winning film director Lord Attenborough.

A (slight) variation on a theme: Pippa Middleton followed in the footsteps of her sister Kate by wearing an almost identical version of the dress first modeled by Kate at the announcement of her engagement to Prince William at Clarence House, in 2010

After all, it was almost identical to the dress worn by Kate Middleton on the day she announced her engagement to Prince William in November 2010.

Apart from the colour of the outfit - red in Pippa's case, and blue in Kate's - there was no difference at all between the two dresses, which were variations of the low-cut silk jersey ‘Forever’ dress by Issa.

And there was little change, too, in Pippa's ability to turn heads at her friend's wedding - a year after she did the same at her sister’s very public ceremony to Prince William.

Now it seems Pippa Middleton is making a habit of upstaging brides on their big day.

The bride, who had taken wedding planning advice from party planner Pippa, arrived in an elegant off-the-shoulder floor-length lace dress with full satin skirt and carrying a posy of cream roses, at the parish church in the village of Aberlady – 15 miles from Edinburgh.

But as she made her way into the church all eyes – and indeed cameras – were on the Duchess of Cambridge’s younger sister.

The body-skimming dress, which showcased single Pippa’s enviable figure and world-famous derriere, was accessorised with a matching fascinator with net veil and black clutch bag and set off with a pair of black heels.

Inside the church Miss Middleton, who arrived with a female friend and one of the young bridesmaids, gave a reading reciting the lyrics from singer Bob Dylan’s Forever Young as part of the service, which included three hymns and a song from the church choir.

Other guests included Freddie Mellor, the son of former Conservative Cabinet Minister David Mellor. Freddie, a friend of the groom since their time at Charterhouse public school in Surrey, was one of five best men.

After the service Miss Middleton, 28, and other guests gathered to throw petals over the newlyweds to the strains of a lone piper, before being driven off in an Audi as others were ferried to the reception at the bride’s family home by coach. Miss Middleton and Miss Hook, also 28, have been friends since 2002 when they met on an exclusive £3,600- a-month cookery course in Frome, Somerset, after leaving school.

Miss Hook, who lives in Clapham, South London, met her fiance when they were students at Durham University.

Their wedding follows tragedy for Mr Holland, 27, who lost members from three generations of his family in the tsunami in 2004. He and his father, shipbroker Michael Holland, survived the Boxing Day disaster after travelling inland from their holiday home in Thailand to play golf.

Mr Holland’s mother Jane, 49 – Lord Attenborough’s eldest daughter – was killed, as were his sister Lucy, 15, and his paternal grandmother, also called Jane, 81. His second sister, Alice, now 24, was seriously injured but survived and was there to support her brother on his big day yesterday, giving a reading during the  45-minute service.

Mr Holland has spoken of how his future wife helped him cope with the loss, saying: ‘Camilla has been a great source of comfort to me over the years. We’re very happy.’
