Fran Halsall hopes British swimmers can prove an inspiration to the next generation of talent with strong performances at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games.

The Loughborough swimmer recalls that home success at the Manchester 2002 Games was inspiring for her.

'I remember watching because the English team had full red swimming costumes to race in and I was like 'that's so cool, I want one of those suits',' said Halsall.

Hopeful: Fran Halsall wants British swimmers to inspire the next generation of talent

'(And) because we did so well it was really enjoyable to watch. I was 12 at the time, I was like I want to be part of the team. I want to be doing that.

'Hopefully everybody who watches this, younger swimmers, will have the same experience I did watching 2002.'

Four years later Halsall was in the Commonwealth Games herself.

The 24-year-old from Southport added: 'Melbourne was amazing. It was one of the best experiences of my life.

'Fifteen,
 flying out to Australia for three weeks on the Gold Coast on a holding 
camp, two weeks in Melbourne in the Commonwealth Village, then 
afterwards going to see the other sports, sight-seeing.

'And I came home with two medals from the relays. I was like 'this swimming thing is amazing'.

'That was my first experience of the senior team. It was incredible and still today is one of my favourites.

'Four years later (in Delhi) I was in a totally different position.

'I'd
 won medals at Europeans, medals at World Championships, so going into 
the Commonwealths it was kind of like 'okay, what can I do? I've got a 
lot of events, I want to be on the podium in most of those events'.

'It was a totally different switch of situation. I embraced that, but it was hard at the same time.

'I
 got a bit ill while I was there and it was a bit of a difficult 
situation to be in, but coming home with five medals (gold in the 
non-Olympic 50metres butterfly, three silvers and a bronze) you've got 
to be happy with that.

'Even though they weren't quite the colours I wanted at the time, looking back it's actually not a bad achievement.'

At
 her third Commonwealth Games, Halsall is now a veteran of the team and 
as well as inspiring spectators, she could also use her experience to 
help the likes of 18-year-old Siobhan Marie O'Connor, who has a 
similarly packed race programme.

She added: 'It's a bit surreal. I'm pretty sure half the juniors are a lot more mature than I am.

'I
 think there's 24 people for whom it is their first time. They're all 
really excited and it's going to be totally different for them.

'For
 me just seeing that and being around that has made it so much more fun,
 rather than "oh, it's the Commonwealth Games again". It's actually 
really exciting.

'It's great to be part of the Games and to swim for England. We don't often get to do that.

'I'm
 feeling it a bit being a bit older, but it's nice. We've got a good 
dynamic on the team. It's a good mix of youth and old people.'

Halsall
 will have five opportunities to impress in Glasgow, in the 50m and 100m
 freestyle, 50m butterfly, 4x100m freestyle relay and 4x100m medley 
relay.

Asked if one gold 
medal in Glasgow would surpass five medals, she added: 'Yes, I think it 
would. To be able to stand at the top of the podium, sing the national 
anthem. That would be a great experience.

'I just want to hit my race plans so my coach (James Gibson) doesn't tell me off.'
