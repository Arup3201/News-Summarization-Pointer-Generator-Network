Homeland actor Damian Lewis has told how going to Eton was the perfect training for his upcoming role as Henry VIII.

The 43-year-old, who has become one of Britain’s biggest acting exports after making his name with roles in Homeland and Band Of Brothers, revealed more about his time at the top independent boarding school after being awarded an OBE.

He was handed the honour, which he described as a ‘huge surprise’, by fellow Old Etonion, the Duke of Cambridge, at an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace this week.

Chuffed: Lewis was awarded an OBE at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday afternoon for his contribution to acting. He compared receiving the honour to a similar feeling to being asked to be school prefect at Eton

With 11 years between Lewis and 32-year-old Prince William, the pair did not cross paths at Eton, the esteemed boarding school located near Windsor, which they both attended.

However, after receiving the honour, Lewis said his time at the school had prepared him well for taking on his next role, as Henry VIII in a six-part BBC adaptation of Wolf Hall, Hilary Mantel’s Man Booker prize-winning historical novel.

Speaking to The Sunday Times, he said: ‘I think there is no question that it helps having had the kind of schooling I’ve had to play a king.

‘It’s not such a leap oddly – even though the thought of being a monarch of any nation is mind-boggling and not something I could imagine easily at all.

‘But, yes, there’s just the sort of court structure, hierarchies and the way they are set up which is something I understand.’

His comments came after he compared his OBE, which he received on Wednesday afternoon, to being made a school prefect, as he felt it put him under pressure to be extremely responsible and to prove himself.

'I remember when I heard I was being awarded it, it was a little bit like "now you've got to prove it",' he said.

'It was a bit like being asked to be a prefect, now I have to be extremely responsible.'

Eton has educated 19 British Prime Ministers, generations of aristocracy, including William and his brother Prince Harry, and a number of actors including Eddie Redmayne, Dominic West, Hugh Laurie and Tom Hiddleston.

Speaking about the educational establishment previously, Lewis told Esquire magazine: 'Suddenly all these little kingpins arrived from their own schools. You’re surrounded by the best of the best.

'Eton is an extraordinary place. And it’s interesting because unless you’re going to Oxford or Cambridge, you feel a bit like you’ve been to the best university already. 

'Because the facilities are second to none. The history, the place, the sense of belonging to a tradition – you can’t beat it.'

The actor, who is married to actress Helen McCrory, will take on his meatiest role yet in Wolf Hall, which is set to be shown on BBC1 in January.

Combining two of Mantel’s books – Wolf Hall and Bring Up The Bodies – the adaptation will chart the rise to power of Thomas Cromwell in the court of Henry VIII.

The TV drama, which is a co-production between Company Pictures and Playground, was agreed more than two years ago, with Peter Kosminsky as director and actor Mark Rylance in the role of Cromwell.

Lewis rose to fame with his performance as Major Richard Winters in the 2001 Second World War epic Band Of Brothers and found international one again more recently in Homeland - in which he played returning prisoner of war Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody.

The US drama has won five Golden Globe awards since it first aired in 2011 and describing its appeal Lewis said: 'I think people watch Homeland for different reasons.

'There's a compelling thriller at the centre of it, but I think people also got very engaged in the relationship at the centre of it between the CIA officer and this turned soldier.

'And how damaged they both were made their relationship compelling, (they were) co-dependent and needy and un-trusting at times and romantic and explosive at other times.

'Set against a backdrop of a plot to blow up the United States it was heady stuff.'
