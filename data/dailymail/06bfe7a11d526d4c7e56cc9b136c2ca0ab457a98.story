From go-go girls to bagpiping troupes, the good times are certainly rolling in the streets of New Orleans with Mardi Gras celebrations in full flow.

The 2015 parades kicked off on January 31 and will come to a close on Fat Tuesday. More than 50 floats have participated in this year's colorful celebration, drawing in thousands of spectators from across the globe.

This year the decorations are bigger and better than ever, with teams spending months on colossal constructs. Standout creations include a giant-sized sparkling pink stiletto by the Krewe of Muses and a larger-than-life zebra made by the Mystic Stripers Society.

Carnival is celebrated along the Gulf Coast with parties, balls and parades culminating on Fat Tuesday, a final day of celebration before the solemnity of Ash Wednesday and Lent. 

Mardi Gras - which carries the slogan 'let the good times roll' - falls on Febuary 17 this year.

In addition to being a tradition for residents, Carnival season is a major tourist draw in New Orleans, especially in the final two weekends when the best-known parades roll, often with local and national celebrities aboard the floats. 

It's a major factor in the city's $6 billion tourism economy, along with the annual Jazz and Heritage Festival, the Essence Festival and other major cultural and sporting events. 

While it is a cause for celebration, trouble can also emerge during Mardi Gras with alcohol and overcrowding triggering disputes.

This week someone was shot and another injured after an altercation occurred mid-parade in New Orleans.

A police spokesman said one suspect was in custody, while a weapon was recovered nearby.
