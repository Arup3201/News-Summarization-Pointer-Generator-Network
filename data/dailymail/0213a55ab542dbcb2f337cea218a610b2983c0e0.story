Usually it is David Walliams watching wife Lara Stone strut the runway from fashion's front row.

But on Sunday, their roles are set to be reversed as the comedian will be taking to the catwalk along with a host of celebrities at Samuel L Jackson's upcoming charity ball at London's Natural History Museum.

Joining Walliams on the catwalk will be Tinie Tempah, Bear Grylls, Mr 
Hudson, David Walliams, Greg Minnaar, Simon Pegg, Daniel Bruhl, Richard 
Jones, George Lamb, Graham Norton and Jeremy Piven.

Supermodel Stone will be in fine company too - Wolf of Wall Street actress Margot Robbie will be in attendance, as well as Avengers actor Chris Evans, Amanda Holden and Sophie Ellis Bextor, while Paloma Faith is set to perform for the 200 guests.

The charity ball, which forms part of London Collections: Men, will feature designs by Alexander McQueen, Asprey, Fendi, Giorgio Armani, 
Hugo Boss, Richard James and Y-3 on the catwalk.

All proceeds will benefit the One
 For The Boys male cancer foundation, a cause close to Samuel L Jackson's heart.

The Pulp Fiction actor said in a statement: 'Men don't tend to talk about their health issues,
 worrying about appearing vulnerable. The problem is that they do not 
have enough information on the subject. 

'One
 For The Boys focuses on cutting through the noise to educate men, in 
the hope that we can have a similar reach to that of the pink 
campaigns.'

The One For The Boys Fashion Ball is one of several events running throughout the year to raise awareness and money for cancers that specifically affect men.

Mr Jackson has been the face of Sofia Davis' One For The Boys charity since 2013, but the bi-annual menwear fashion extravaganza will be the first public event he has hosted for them.

The gala involves a Moët & Chandon reception, dinner cooked by a team of Michelin star chefs including Michael Caines MBE, Marcus Wareing and 
Jason Atherton and a silent auction as well as the runway show.
