The next six months could prove the best time in history to take out a mortgage, experts claimed yesterday.

They said a price war between lenders will make it the perfect opportunity for homebuyers or anyone remortgaging.

Fixed-rate deals have never been cheaper and may even slip below 1 per cent within weeks. Variable rates have almost halved over the past 12 months to 1.64 per cent. 

Brian Murphy, of the Mortgage Advice Bureau, said: ‘The next six months are shaping up to be the best-ever window to secure a low interest rate if you are looking to buy or remortgage.

‘Today’s prices have never been bettered in modern times and given that a base rate rise is inevitable at some point, it is unlikely they will be surpassed in the years ahead.

‘Lenders have begun the year with a strong appetite for growth, and newcomers are going head to head with established names to launch attractive new deals.’

Bank of England data shows that a typical two-year fix has dropped from 2.37 per cent to 2.01 per cent over the past 12 months. 

On a £200,000 loan with 25 per cent deposit, that would save £420 a year. 

A five-year fix has fallen from 3.34 per cent to 3.09 per cent, saving £300 a year. And the average variable rate has plunged from 2.74 per cent to 1.64 per cent – chopping £1,300 off annual repayments.

Lenders have dropped their rates after economists tipped the Bank to keep its base rate at an historic low of 0.5 per cent until next year.

The arrival of new challenger banks entering the mortgage market has also increased competition, driving down rates further.

Experts said two-year fixed rates could fall below 1 per cent while five-year mortgages could go below 2 per cent.

Mortgage broker Andrew Montlake, of Coreco, said: ‘We are now seeing rates fall to a level that once seemed unthinkable.

‘Mortgage lenders are in the midst of a rate war which shows no sign of abating soon, as they battle it out for business.

‘With new lenders coming into the market and competition intensifying we could even see these offerings fall a touch lower.

‘The next few months could well prove to be the best time to lock into low rates which may not be seen again for a generation.’

He warned however that the low rates on offer sometimes came with high one-off fees.

And, while mortgages are cheap, steep property prices mean home ownership is still out of reach for many. Prices across the UK rose by 10 per cent in the last year and 15 per cent in London, with the average home now £271,000 or £501,000 in the capital, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Campbell Robb of the charity Shelter said: ‘Despite talk of mortgages being at an historic low, it certainly doesn’t feel like that for many young people and families for whom buying their own home remains a distant dream.

‘Sky high house prices mean families working hard and saving what they can can’t even come close to affording a home of their own. The only way to tackle our housing crisis is for politicians to build the affordable houses we urgently need.’

Mortgage rates are also at record lows for homeowners with lower deposits such as 5 and 10 per cent.

But while many banks have slashed interest rates potential buyers must still pass strict affordability tests which were introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority last April.

The Mortgage Market Review forces lenders to ask applicants in-depth questions about their income and spending habits to ensure they can still afford their repayments if interest rates rise significantly.

Last June, the Bank of England also recommended that no more than 15 per cent of new lending was for high-risk loans worth more than 4.5 times buyers’ income.

Both of these restrictions initially slowed down the mortgage market as lenders were reluctant to lend for fear of breaking the rules.

However, lending has since bounced back after banks and building societies adapted to the changes. Lenders are now making up for lost time and competing aggressively for customers, including those with low deposits, providing they can comfortably afford such a large debt.

The low-deposit market has been fuelled by the Government’s Help to Buy scheme, where the state helps buyers with small deposits on to the property ladder.

One of the reasons banks are able to offer mortgages at such low rates at the moment is because they have a glut of cash to loan out from the Funding for Lending scheme.

Launched in 2012, the initiative allowed banks and building societies to borrow cheaply from the Bank on condition they then used some of the money to offer mortgages to home buyers.

Rigorous stress testing must still be carried out on customers, however, before loans are agreed. 

Where are the cheapest fixed rate mortgages? 

The best rate on an online easy access savings account is currently  1.5 per cent from Kent Reliance in branch.  You could also put money away tax-free in a cash Isa and NS&I has the best easy access Isa at 1.5 per cent.

There are 25 mortgages priced below these savings rates - not all are fixed rates, some are tracker or variable rates and the cost of these would move up if interest rate rise. 

HSBC has a record low two-year fixed rate at 1.19 per cent with a £1,499 fee, but you will also need a big 40 per cent deposit.

A 25-year £150,000 mortgage would cost £578 a month and £15,378 over two years, including the fee. 

But you must watch out for the fees attached to the best mortgages as these have risen, so it is still important to shop around.

For example, the high fee actually makes this mortgage more expensive. 

In comparison,Yorkshire Building Society has a higher rate at 1.29 per cent with a £975 fee.

That 25-year £150,000 mortgage with Yorkshire Building Society would cost slightly more at £585 a month, but thanks to its lower fee come in £358 cheaper than HSBC at £15,020 over two years.

You could also get a rate of 1.24 per cent from Chelsea Building Society with a £1,675 fee.

The Post Office has a two-year fixed rate at 1.37 per cent with a £1,995 fee, while Norwich & Peterborough Building Society has a deal at 1.39 per cent with a £795 fee.
