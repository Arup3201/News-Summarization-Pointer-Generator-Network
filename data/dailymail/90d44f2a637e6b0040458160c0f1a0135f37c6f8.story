The rickety steamboat African Queen, which starred alongside Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn in the classic 1951 film of the same name, is back in the water having been saved from the scrapyard.

The Iconic craft, which had sat rotting in dry dock for over a decade, is now being used to take tourists on river cruises in Key Largo, Florida after an extensive $60,000 refit.

In the classic Hollywood film the African Queen sailed down the Congo river before being  transformed into a torpedo and blown to smithereens taking out a World War One German warship moored in Lake Tanganyika.

Originally named the
Livingstone, the wooden boat was built in 1912 for the British East Africa Railway 
Company and was used to ferry missionaries, cargo and big game hunters 
in the Belgian Congo and Uganda.

It was acquired by director John Huston and Sam Spiegel in 1950 and renamed the African Queen.

But it fell into a state of disrepair following the death of its last owner almost 10 years ago.

It had sat in a dry dock in the 
Florida Keys for the last decade, but still attracted scores of tourists
keen to catch a glimpse of movie history.

Last year its owner Jim Hendricks, 
announced his intention to restore the Queen to her former glory  and 
use her for river cruises.

Mr Hendricks inherited the African Queen from his late father, who bought the boat in 1982 for £41,000.

Miami couple Lance and Suzanne 
Holmquist, who are leasing the 30-foot Queen from Mr Hendricks, were 
determined to save her from the scrapyard and paid for the restoration 
work themsleves.

Suzanne told the Miami Herald: 'There is still an extreme amount of interest in the African Queen.

'Every week, while we were sitting 
here just two boats away, we would see hundreds of people come to 
photograph it, look at it and remember it.'

Mr Hendricks said he didn’t have the money to keep up the boat and was happy to lease it to the Holmquists.

He told the paper: 'It broke my heart to see it 
deteriorating,' the younger Hendricks said. 'Something had to be done 
with it and I couldn’t get it done.

'I’m glad Lance and Suzanne have picked it up and are giving the Queen her voice back.'
