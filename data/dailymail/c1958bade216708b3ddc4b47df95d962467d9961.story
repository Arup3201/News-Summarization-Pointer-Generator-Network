A spate of motor accidents involving tourists have prompted concerned New Zealand motorists to confiscate the keys of foreigners to prevent them from driving. 

Following the death of eight people  in crashes involving tourists in the past fortnight, five incidents of key confiscation have been reported in the nation's South Island, an area  which featured heavily in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy films.

New Zealand Prime Minister  John Key said that 'people taking the law into their own hands is not sensible'.

Foreign drivers are involved in 37% of road crashes in the Westland District, on the South Island's West Coast, despite only 6% of crashes overall in the country involving tourists.

558 crashes involving tourists occurred in the past 12 months, with over 75% of the accidents found to be the fault of the foreign driver, reported The Mercury.  

New Zealand Police's Assistant Commissioner of Road Policing, Dave Cliff, told CNN that the incidents of key confiscation were hard to police as there was no specific law relating to the issue.

He reiterated that violence, even to prevent a tourist driving 'dangerously' would not be tolerated, 'and anyone found doing so should expect to face the consequences'.

Assistant Commissioner Cliff's comments follow the assault of a tourist driving on the West Coast by a man who was unhappy with his driving.

The tourist was punched in the face and had his keys taken from him, with local police labelling the incident unnecessary and 'nasty', reported The New Zealand Herald.

'I have no problem with doing it again. If it saves people's lives I have no problem with it,' said Mr Penman

30,000 people have signed a petition, currently before Parliament, to force tourists to sit a safety test before being allowed to drive on New Zealand roads

A family of four from Hong Kong collided with a logging truck, killing all in the vehicle 

West Coast's Grey District Mayor Tony Kokshoorn, said while there was definitely an issue in the area, he was worried that 'extremist behaviour' from local drivers were becoming more common.

He labelled the violence 'disgraceful' and 'inappropriate', and called for greater driver education.

The Assistant Commissioner assured the New Zealand public at the time that police were not complacent about driver safety, but urged people to contact police if they were concerned, rather than resorting to the confiscation of keys.

Diesel mechanic Robert Penman, of Dunedin, took the keys of a Chinese couple when they stopped their car in the middle of a one lane road, and waited for police to attend the incident.

'I have no problem with doing it again. If it saves people's lives I have no problem with it,' he told The New Zealand Herald. 

'I've been in a head-on crash before and I don't want to be in another one...Everywhere I have been people say 'good on you' for standing up,' Mr Penman said. 

30,000 people have signed a petition, currently before Parliament, to force tourists to sit a safety test before being allowed to drive on New Zealand roads. 

However,  a Queenstown judge ruled on Monday that it was not the responsibility of rental car companies to assess the competency of drivers, and rather up to the individual driver to determine their own abilities. 

Earlier in the month a 39-year-old Taiwanese female teacher was charged with careless driving causing death and careless driving causing injury.

She was driving to the airport in a rented van with six family members when she drove through a stop sign, causing the death of her father and seriously injuring her mother.

Paul Whitmell, 57, and his wife Rosa, 54, were driving from Mt Cook to Te Anau, when they were involved in a head-on collision with Chinese driver Qian Li, 34, on Gibbston Highway on February 21. 

The British couple suffered serious injuries, and Li's passenger  Mingyue Shen was also injured, for which the judge sentenced Li on three charges of careless driving causing injury.

Li was disqualified from driving in New Zealand for 10 months.
