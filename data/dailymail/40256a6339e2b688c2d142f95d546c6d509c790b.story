An anonymous donor has given $150,000 to a campaign aiming to stop a gold ring once owned by beloved novelist Jane Austen from being taken out of the UK by American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson.

Jane Austen's House Museum began the campaign to raise the cost of the ring to keep the piece in the country.

As a self-proclaimed ‘history nerd’, pop star Clarkson was happy to pay more than £150,000, or US$232,000, for the ring that once belonged to Jane Austen.

National treasure: Musician Kelly Clarkson, pictured at the Annual Academy of Country Music Awards in Las Vegas earlier this year, has been told she can't take the ring out of the UK

But the 31-year-old singer was told she could not take the item out of Britain and back to her native Texas because it is a ‘national treasure’.

Clarkson, the first winner of talent show American Idol, saw off seven bidders in an auction at Sotheby’s last year for the gold and turquoise ring.

Still in its original box, it was sold for $235,596 despite being expected to fetch only $46,362.

But when Clarkson applied for an export license, a reviewing committee recommended that the ring should be kept in the UK.

Culture Secretary Ed Vaizey has placed a temporary export bar on the item in the hope a UK buyer can be found to purchase it.

He said: ‘Jane Austen’s modest lifestyle and her early death mean that objects associated with her of any kind are extremely rare, so I hope this simple but elegant ring can be saved for the nation.’

If no British bidder comes forward the Government will not be able to refuse an export license.

Clarkson has indicated she will be willing to sell the piece of jewellery if an offer matching hers is made.

The campaign to keep the ring in the UK was only begun on Friday, but with the help of the anonymous donor has already raised $160,000.

The museum was able to make a 'serious expression' of its intention to buy the ring, and was able to gain an extension on the ban until 30 December, according to the Guardian.

'We have very few of Austen's effects, so the ring is very unusual. It has very good provenance, there's a note from 1863 handwritten by Eleanor Jackson, second wife of Jane's brother Henry Austen.

'Henry was the one to negotiate the deals with Austen's publishers and so was a significant character in her life – and a bit of a Wickham. The note is giving it to a niece, saying this was given to me by Cassandra (Jane's sister) when she knew I was marrying Henry and it belonged to aunt Jane,' Louise West, Jane Austen's House Museum manager told the Guardian.

If the museum manages to buy back the ring, Clarkson will be invited to visit the piece as often as she'd like.

'We can only speak to Clarkson's "people", so we don't know if she even knows she's been invited to visit,' said West.

'We were very excited that someone like Kelly Clarkson was a fan of Jane Austen - it's not what you'd expect from a young, cool US pop singer. It says a lot about Austen's popularity and who she's popular with. It's not just middle-aged women.'

Miss Clarkson encountered a similar problem when she bought a first edition of Jane Austen’s novel Persuasion, saying last year: ‘We put in an export request but I can’t take it out of the UK as they’ve named it a national treasure.’

If the museum is successful in raising the remaining cash to buy back the ring, it will be displayed next year as part of the bicentenary of Mansfield Park's publication.

In Mansfield Park, the protagonist Fanny Price is given an amber cross by her brother - inspiration for which seems to have come from Austen's own life. A cross gifted to Austen by her brother is now in the museum's collection.

'To have the cross and ring together is very exciting,' West told the Guardian.

The museum had attempted to purchase the ring at auction, but the piece went so far above its expected price that the museum was unable to compete.

'The Heritage Lottery Fund would have helped us, but Sotheby's had generated a lot of interest and we were unable to raise the cash at such short notice,' said West.
