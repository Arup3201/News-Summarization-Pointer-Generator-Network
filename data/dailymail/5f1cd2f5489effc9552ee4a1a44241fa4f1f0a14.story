Sci-fi fans can boldly go beyond ordinary TV remote controls with their own replica of the Star Trek phaser.

Built using access to the original weapon first used nearly 50 years ago in the original series, the gadget can store up to 36 channel changing commands, and makes 10 authentic phaser firing sounds.

It was created by The Wand Company after the Cambridge firm got exclusive access to the last remaining prop from the TV show.

The replica phaser (pictured) was built by The Wand Company and goes on sale in November. Phasers are fictional weapons that have been used by Starfleet personnel since the original series of the TV show. The gadget can store up to 36 remote control commands and makes 10 phaser firing sounds

To build the replica, engineers used a laser to create 3D scans of the device. These scans were then turned into the finished model.

The phaser has been the standard weapon used by Star Trek’s Starfleet personnel since the original series began in 1966.

The
 fictional weapons often resemble a handheld gun or pistol, but use a directed energy beam to target enemies, rather than bullets. 

Most are classed as particle weapons that fire particle beams.

Larger
 phaser ‘rifles’ have also appeared in Star Trek over the years, and 
‘phaser arrays’ are mounted on starships, such as the USS Enterprise, to
 defend against attacks from enemy ships.  

According to the show, phasers were invented during the 23rd century and used by Starfleet from 2233.

Phaser rifles were used as early as 2265, alongside laser pistols, and can be set to stun or kill.

It also comes with tactile force-feedback, a customisable personal lock code, and is sold in a foam-lined presentation case.

And, because it uses infra-red, it can control almost all home entertainment systems and many other infra-red controlled devices.

Chris Barnardo, co-founder of The Wand Company, said: ‘The Star Trek Phaser is one of the most iconic pieces of sci-fi gadgetry.

‘We were privileged to get access to this amazing prop and be the first to 3D laser scan it.

‘We have spent thousands of hours creating a detailed collectible that will bring new levels of action and enjoyment to Star Trek fans all over the world.’

In 2010, the Wand Company turned down £200,000 from Duncan Bannatyne after demonstrating their Harry Potter wand on Dragon's Den.

The firm has since created more than 150,000 of the gadgets, and last year released versions of Doctor Who's Sonic Screwdriver under license from the BBC.

The Star Trek Original Series Phaser Universal Remote Control goes on sale in the UK only from November, and can be pre-ordered from Firebox for £119.95.
