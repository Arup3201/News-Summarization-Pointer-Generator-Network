At first glance it looks as if Marilyn Monroe might actually have come to life - tilting her head and cracking a gentle smile as she is sprayed with water.

Firemen from the Palm Springs Fire Department took a break from their more serious duties on Wednesday to give the Hollywood star a scrub down.

The transportable Forever Marilyn sculpture, based on one of the most recognisable images of the late actress, is currently based in California.

The image, in which the actress stands over a gusty subway grate, is taken from the 1955 film 'The Seven Year Itch'.

The 7.9 metre sculpture, was designed by Seward Johnson, famed for his painted bronze sculptures.

The traveling sculpture will be on display in Palm Springs before moving on to another city later this year.

Weighing 17 tons, the sculpture was previously located at the Pioneer Plaza in Chicago, before being moved to Palm Springs last year.
