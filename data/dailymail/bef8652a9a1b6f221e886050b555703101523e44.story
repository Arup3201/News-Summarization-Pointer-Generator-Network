Determined: Meirion Jones 'fought tooth and nail' to expose events

The BBC was in uproar last night over astonishing allegations involving the reporter leading tomorrow’s Panorama exposé of claims that the Corporation covered up sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile.

Top BBC journalist Meirion Jones angrily denied he had concealed the potential involvement of one of his relatives in the scandal.

Mr Jones says the allegation is designed to discredit him and the Panorama investigation into claims that Newsnight was ordered to scrap a film about Savile’s sex crimes.

The BBC civil war intensified after it was alleged the reporter tried to censor a video interview with one of Savile’s victims, who referred to Mr Jones’s aunt, Margaret Jones, and her role as headmistress of a school where the DJ preyed on young girls.

In a statement to The Mail on Sunday last night, Mr Jones said: ‘Allegations I concealed an interview to protect my aunt are ludicrous. The tape was in the [editing process] ready to go into the Newsnight film last December. I made it available in full to Panorama and Newsnight. If my purpose was to protect my aunt, I would never have tried to uncover the scandal in the first place.’

The crisis is the biggest faced by the BBC since the Hutton Inquiry probed claims that Downing Street  ‘sexed up’ intelligence reports in the run-up to the Iraq War.

The latest disclosures come days before new BBC Director General George Entwistle is grilled by a Commons committee over the Corporation’s handling of the scandal.

The corporation also stands accused of protecting other star presenters who staff had voiced concerns over.

The BBC is said to have ignored 
complaints, including those of sexual harassment, and allowed those 
under question to continue working without facing investigation, the 
Observer has reported.

It added that he culture of allowing TV stars to take liberties with their position has caused anger among BBC staff.

One woman alleges that female 
producers were warned to keep their distance from historian Adam 
Hart-Davis, now 69, after making women feel uncomfortable with sexual 
comments and advances.

She told the Observer: 'I thought it was unfair that we would be warned but a presenter wouldn't be expected to change his behaviour.'

But the second cousin of David 
Cameron said he was not aware of the warnings but admitted he was 
told he had offended a female employee and added that he 'greatly regrets' having annoyed her.related]

Mr Jones led the Newsnight investigation, and is now helping Panorama uncover how the Newsnight show was abandoned.

The latest incident in the BBC feud concerns the original Newsnight probe into Savile, led by Mr Jones.

The
script for the programme, which was scrapped days before it was 
scheduled to be broadcast, included a filmed interview with one of 
Savile’s victims at Duncroft Approved School for Girls in Staines, 
Middlesex[

BBC insiders say they were shocked to discover last week that Mr Jones recorded an interview with a second victim who had referred to Mr Jones’s aunt, the headmistress at the school.

Crucially, they say Mr Jones did not tell
BBC bosses of the second interview – and they claimed Newsnight had not
intended to broadcast it.

One source said: ‘We were staggered 
when we found out Jones had filmed a second victim who mentioned his 
aunt. Serious questions need to be asked about why this stayed secret. 
If it was left on the cutting-room floor because of Jones’s personal 
interest in the story, it would be totally unprofessional.’

The
Mail on Sunday has been told senior BBC management only became aware of
the second interview when part of it was broadcast by Newsnight last 
week – though not the section that referred to Mr Jones’s aunt. However,
sources close to Mr Jones reacted with fury to the claims against him. 
‘These allegations are totally untrue, a malicious smear and utterly 
outrageous,’ said one.

They
say the Mr Jones made no secret of his family connection with the 
school. ‘He visited the school as a teenager and could see something odd
was going on with Savile,’ said one. ‘That is why he was so determined 
to expose it.’

Furthermore, they say there was no 
conspiracy to ‘bury’ the second interview. ‘If the film had been 
screened, the second interview would have been in it,’ said a source.

Historian and BBC presenter Adam Hart-Davies, pictured, said he was unaware of allegations that women were warned to keep their distance from him

‘Meirion
fought tooth and nail to get it on air. He knew it could open his aunt 
to criticism, so the idea he would try to cover it up or try to protect 
his aunt is absurd.’

The second interview was with a former Duncroft pupil called Rochelle Shepherd.

In
the Newsnight show broadcast last week, ten months after the footage 
was recorded, she said Savile was naively treated as a ‘saviour’ by 
pupils. She added: ‘In fact, he was the complete antithesis of that.

‘The
girls would say how he never stopped eyeing up their t***, and how he 
lined everybody up to kiss them all goodbye. He stuck his tongue in 
their mouths and touched their breasts.’

The preying TV star terrified his enemies by bragging of his links to IRA killers - claiming he could have terrorists cripple anyone he wished.

It is believed his threats of violence were also used against his victims to stun them into silence, The Sunday People has reported.

Reporter James Saville recalled the time he met the star in 2000, who he said was 'raging' over the death of a friend and demanding details of anyone involved so he could on his friends in the IRA to 'get them done'.

Investigators believe he used the threats as a weapon to stifle accusations as he systematically abuse children.

More than 200 people have come forward to say they were abused by the TV star

Contacted by The Mail on Sunday yesterday, Ms Shepherd said the headmistress ‘must have known’ Savile was a sex offender, adding: ‘She had been friends with him for a long time.’

Mrs Jones could not be reached for comment. Ms Shepherd said Mr Jones made clear from the start he was the nephew of the headmistress, but she didn’t get the impression that he wanted to protect her.

Asked whether she thought the section about Mrs Jones was cut because of the family connection, Ms Shepherd said: ‘No.’

Several other former Duncroft pupils have told how Savile abused them during visits.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC has launched an independent review led by former Head of Sky News, Nick Pollard, which will cover these questions. It would not be appropriate to comment further until this has been concluded.’

Jimmy Savile was a frequent guest at garden parties at Duncroft Approved School for Girls in Staines, pictured right.

In the Sixties, the school for intelligent girls from troubled backgrounds was looked on in some quarters as ‘an educational experiment’.

Former pupils recall that other visitors included  the popular character actor James Robertson Justice and  the Conservative politician  Rab Butler.

The school in Surrey became embroiled in the Savile scandal after a former pupil, Karin Ward, accused Savile of sexually abusing girls there.

Waiving her right to anonymity, Miss Ward and three others said in the ITV documentary, Exposure: The Other Side Of Jimmy Savile, that the DJ would sit girls on his lap and put his hands up their skirts and in  their underwear.

Another of his alleged victims claimed the headmistress, Margaret Jones – aunt of BBC journalist Meirion Jones – had dismissed their allegations.

The school closed in the Eighties and is now luxury flats.
