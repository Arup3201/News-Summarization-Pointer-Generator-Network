A woman who smoked and kept watch as her boyfriend repeatedly punched an African migrant during a violent robbery has been jailed for 30 months.

Jamiee Lee Haynes, 28, stood by as Timothy Williams attacked their victim, then helped steal his belongings which had fallen to the floor when he tried to run away at Wollongong Train Station last October

Just half an hour before the brutal incident, she had been at Wollongong police station to answer bail for offences including being armed with intent and common assault. CCTV in the station recorded her at the front desk. Williams, 26, was with her.

The pair were arrested after police followed a trail of security camera footage, which proved that the attack was planned and that Haynes played a role in assisting Williams.

They escaped with the Eritrean migrant's neck;ace, a bracelet, a pair of sunglasses, a set of headphones and $60 in cash.

Officers were waiting for the pair at Wollongong Police Station the day after the attack, with Ms Haynes needing to report again.

Williams was jailed for nine years when he appeared in court on Thursday. In handing down a lesser sentence to Haynes, Judge Paul Conlon of the Wollongong District Court took into consideration her lesser role in the incident.

He noted that she was unlikely to have known to what extent Williams was planning to injure their victim.

The man, who had only been in Australia for five days, lost a tooth in the violent assault and required stitches in his left ear.

It was hardly a warm welcome to the country for the refugee, who had relocated from his native Eritrea - one of the most violent countries in the world.

Speaking at Mr Williams' sentencing on Thursday, Judge Paul Conlon said the shocking CCTV footage was a reliable account of what happened during the violent assault.

'A viewing of this footage is all that is needed to make an accurate assessment of the objective seriousness of this offence,' he said, the Illawarra Mercury reported.

The Judge confirmed that the pair were waiting for their victim to reach the train station's pedestrian walkway.

'When the victim was stopped, it was also clear that there was a plan of action,' he said.

He also revealed how Mr Williams attempted to downplay the attack while speaking to a court-appointed psychologist.

'He provides [the doctor] with a palpably false version of his confrontation and vicious assault on an unsuspecting victim,' Judge Conlon said.

Mr Williams will be locked up for six years, back-dated to when he first came into custody at the time of the offence, and won't be eligible for parole until 2019.

Ms Haynes was charged with aggravated robbery with wounding and was sentenced to 30 months behind bars, with a non-parole period of 15 months on Friday.

Trickery: Mr Williams appears to chat with the man as he goes through his bag, while his blonde friend Jaimee Lee Haynes, 28, hangs around in the background as a lookout

Surprising: At the beginning of the CCTV video it appears that the two men are just chatting like friends but Mr Williams is actually demanding his victim's cash

Floored: The Illawarra man sets upon his victim without hesitation

Deceptive: It may look like Mr Williams is bending down to help the man on the floor but he is actually just moving him so he can hit him again

The victim was a refugee from Eritrea, a country in the Horn of Africa that is bordered by Sudan to the west, Ethiopia in the south, and Djibouti in the east.

The man had only been in Australia - supposedly a safe nation - for five weeks when he was violently set upon.

His home country, which has a poor human rights record, is now in a fragile state of peace after more than 30 years of fighting.

However, thousands are now fleeing due to a forced labour program that is spawning human rights violations, according to a report last month that will be debated next month at the U.N. Human Rights Council.

The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR estimates that 2,000 people of Eritrea's 6 million population are fleeing every month.

Their relatives are forced to pay fines of 50,000 nafka (about $3,607) for each family member who has left.

Most families can't afford the fine so a family member may be detained until the money is paid, or business licenses or property may be confiscated, the report said.

The government began its program of national service, where people are put to work in reforestation, soil and water conservation and reconstruction, in 1995 but it has turned into an indefinite conscription, the report said.

Eritrea emerged from its long war of independence in 1993 only to plunge once again into military conflict, first with Yemen and then with its old adversary, Ethiopia.

The country is ruled by President Isaias Afewerki, who has been in office since independence in 1993. National elections have been scheduled and cancelled - they have ever been held since the country became independent.

People who practice 'unregistered' religions, try to flee the nation, or escape military duty are arrested and put into prison.

The religions that are allowed in the country are the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Roman Catholic Church, Eritrean Lutheran Church, and Sunnite Islam.

All other religions are persecuted and freedom of worship is one of the top reasons thousands of Eritreans flee the country.

Meanwhile, a 2011 UN report estimated that about 70 per cent of Eritreans cannot meet their food needs on their own. But the government insists Eritrea is self-sufficient in food and declines international food aid.

Domestic and international human rights organisations are also not allowed to function in Eritrea.
