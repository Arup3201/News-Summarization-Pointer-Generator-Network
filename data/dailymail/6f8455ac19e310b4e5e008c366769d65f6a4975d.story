Hundreds of young women from around the world are kicking their dance routines into high gear in New York this week in hopes of joining dance troupe the Rockettes.

The aspiring dancers lined up Tuesday morning on a Manhattan street - getting only 30 seconds each to audition for a chance to be in the 2013 Radio City Christmas Spectacular.

Amid noisy rush-hour traffic, their hair was neatly pulled back. Their makeup was perfect, some batting fake eyelashes. And they all wore high-heeled dance shoes.

Each dancer had only 30 seconds to impress the panel at the open audition for the Radio City Hall Christmas Spectacular

Dancers reportedly earn $1,500 a week on the show, performing five times a day

The girls were trying to impress the judging panel to become one of 80 dancers in the Rockettes troupe for the 2013 Christmas season

Chelsey Knapper, in the striped jacket, was back for a second audition after missing out in 2012. The 22-year-old from Detroit, Michigan said it was her 'dream' to dance with The Rockettes

Tyler Clark, 21, from Boston, warmed up for her third attempt at making her way into the dance troupe

'I've always wanted to do this,' said Chelsey Knapper, 22, of Detroit, who didn't survive last year's auditions.

For this 'cattle call' - as the free-for-all lineup is called - Knapper and the others were led upstairs into a rehearsal studio to perform a dance routine before a panel of judges.

The quick, precise routine includes a double pirouette and a leg extension.

Those who survive through the end of the week - a good dozen or so - will still have to wait months to find out if they'll actually be invited to join the holiday show that runs from November 8 to December 30.

Madison Square Garden Entertainment, which produces the show, declined to discuss earnings. But Rockettes reportedly earn about $1,500 a week.

Dancer Liz Daniels, from San Diego, stretched out during the warm up - but was turned away for a third time

The show is directed and choreographed by Linda Haberman, who put the girls through their paces

Haberman told dancers: 'I either keep you or cut you'

They pay their own expenses to get to New York because, Knapper said, 'I'd love to be on the line, it's my dream.'

Groups of dancers waited their turn at either side of the studio.

Some wiped beads of nervous sweat off their foreheads, fanning themselves. Others leaned down for sips of bottled water as ceiling fans whirred to keep the space cool.

On her third try to become a Rockette, 'I just got cut,' said Liz Daniels, 27, of San Diego, California.

'You get one shot,' she added. 'But it's not disappointing; there's all kinds of choreography, and that's how it goes.'

Only a dozen dancers are expected to make it through this week's auditions

The dancers all wore leotards and heeled shoes while their hair was pulled back

Dancers from around the world head to New York every April for the open Rockettes auditions

The auditionees had to prove they were great at ballet, tap and jazz - with only 30 seconds to show what they could do

To audition, prospective Rockettes must be between 5ft 6in and 5ft 10in and proficient in ballet, tap, and jazz.

Directing the whole Christmas spectacular is choreographer Linda Haberman.

'I either keep you or cut you,' she said.

Whoever survives the cutthroat process will join a troupe of about 80 Rockettes who are 'a part of history, an iconic part of New York City,' Haberman said.

Another 40 or so Rockettes go on the road.

Dancers wanted to be part of the troupe's long history - it has been performing at Radio City Music Hall since 1935

Marie Schou, from St Louis, took a moment to perfect her lipstick before she took her turn to audition

Every dancer wore perfect makeup for her audition. New Yorker Catherine Wolfson, 20, took a moment to curl her lashes before her turn

Dancers took every spare moment to adjust their appearance before their audition slot

Prospective Rockette Elizabeth Moran is in her 30s - 'that's older for a Rockette,' she said with a wry smile, explaining her reluctance to give her exact age.

'I've loved the Rockettes ever since I was younger,' said Moran, who lives in New York City and works in finance for a Dutch bank.

Knapper, who was taking her second shot at a spot on stage, said: 'People spend years trying out.' Her backup plan is medical school.

Auditions always happen in April despite the show being half a year away

Monica Woods, 21, didn't last the day, but said: 'I'll be back, for sure.'

'You learn not to take it personally,' said Woods, who is graduating from Fordham University this year.

She comes from Mascoutah, an Illinois community with one traffic light and a population of about 7,000.

Monica Woods, 21, was unsuccessful on her second audition but vowed to try again next year

The audition routine included a double pirouette and a leg extension

Signed with a talent agency for musical theater work, she said she will keep auditioning while working at a coffee shop.

'Everyone is kind of in the same boat - nervous but trying not to act like you're nervous,' she said.

'You just put on a smile. I love it, though.'
