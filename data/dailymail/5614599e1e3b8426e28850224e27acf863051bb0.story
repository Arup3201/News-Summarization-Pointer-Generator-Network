George W Bush asked his officials: ‘Anything of interest this morning?’ half an hour before the 9/11 attacks began, newly declassified CIA documents reveal.

The former US President was flicking through his newspaper during his 8am briefing when he asked for an update on the day’s news.

But at 8.21am, four minutes before the meeting ended, the first of four hijacked planes’ transponders went off, marking the beginning of the horror of September 11 2001.

Shock: Minutes before chief of staff Andy Card interrupted George Bush's speech at Booker Elementary School to say 'America is under attack', the president had sat through a remarkably uneventful security briefing

According to a dramatic account of the day by Bush's former intelligence adviser Michael Morell, in the wake of the attacks Bush seized up in apparent shock whilst on Air Force One - and was staring silently into space for five minutes.

It was the President's first moment to take stock since the attacks began but he left Morell feeling 'uncomfortable' seeing him freeze up.

Morell’s version of what happened that day is in the trove of CIA documents that were declassified this week after Freedom of Information Requests.

Titled ‘11 September 2001: With the President’, it reveals in detail how the day unfolded from when Bush had his morning briefing in his suite at a hotel in Longboat Key in Florida, where he was staying at the time whilst traveling.

By the end of the day some 2,995 people would perish in the worst loss of life for America since Pearl Harbour when Al Qaeda terrorists flew planes into the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon.

Morell, who later became deputy director of the CIA, writes: ‘A little after 8am, Chief of Staff (Andrew) Card opened the door, said: ‘Good morning’ and and motioned us in.

‘We found the president seated at a table with a cup of coffee and a newspaper. He seemed surrounded by plates of fruit and pastries.

‘When he saw us, he asked if we had enjoyed our night on the beach.

‘I reminded him that my schedule did not allow for late evenings out, adding that I heard some waves but had not actually seen any. He said: ‘Michael, you need to get a new job.’

‘He put down his newspaper and said: ‘Anything of interest this morning?’

‘On arguably the most important day in President Bush’s tenure, his intelligence briefing was uneventful.’

Bush and his motorcade then drove to Booker Elementary School in Sarasota - and during the drive the first plane hit the North Tower of the World Trade Centre.

Morell writes: ‘Within minutes of Flight 11′s impact, just as we were pulling up to the school, (White House press secretary Ari) Fleischer’s cell phone rang.

‘He listened for a few seconds and flipped his phone off. He turned to me and asked: ‘Michael, do you know anything about a plane hitting the World Trade Centre?’

‘I said "no" but I told him I would make some calls. As the motorcade came to a stop, I said: ‘Ari, I sure hope this is an accident and not terrorism.’

Morell writes that in his mind this hope began to ‘unravel’ a few minutes later when he heard the jet was a commercial airliner - and a second one had struck the South Tower.

He writes: ‘There was now no question: this was not an accident but a deliberate act of terrorism’.

At that point Bush was informed by his chief of staff as he sat in a room with 16 first graders.

The moment was captured in a now famous photograph: Card can be seen leaning into the President’s ear as he says: ‘America is under attack’.

After making a speech at the school the President and his motorcade sped to Air Force One where a long line formed for everyone to be given security screening to get on board.

Morell writes that there were bomb sniffing dogs checking every bag and that even he was inspected despite his high security clearance.

He writes: ‘The plane was eerily quiet in those first few moments after the take-off.

‘Most of the people on board were still in shock and were anxious about what still might happen. The president was in his office with a small number of close aides. From there, he ordered the nation’s military to a high state of alert.’

Air Force One briefly landed at Barksdale Air Force base in Louisiana to offload some passengers and take on more supplies.

Bush was then flown to US Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska but insisted on being taken back to Washington that day.

Morell writes that the President was firm and ignored the objections of his staff, who said it was not safe, by saying: ‘I’m coming back’.

At one point Bush summoned Morell to tell him who had carried out the attack and asked him: ‘When will we know?’

Morell told him he thought it was Al Qaeda under the direction of Osama bin Laden but he could not say for sure.

Account: Intelligence chief Michael Morell was interviewed for the report, and described the eerie quietness

A White House photographer was also on board and took pictures of Bush as the commander in chief during the time of crisis.

Morell writes: ‘After the photographer left Bush just said nothing.

‘He, Andy Card and I just sat. One minute elapsed, then two then three. I was beginning to feel uncomfortable.

‘After five minutes I asked the President if he needed anything else. The President said: "No Michael, thanks very much". I rose, left the room and returned to my seat in the empty staff section of the aircraft.

‘For the first time that day I felt very tired. I closed my eyes hoping that I could sleep for a few minutes. But sleep never came.’

Morell writes that he kept his own emotions in check until he got off Air Force One later that night and cried.

He went home to his wife and three children in northern Virginia and ‘thought of the thousands of children who would never seen their parents again’.

He wrote: ‘I kissed my three on their foreheads and told them I loved them’.
