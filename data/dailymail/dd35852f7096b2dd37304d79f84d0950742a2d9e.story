A woman who wanted tattoos of ladybirds on her hand was left with markings that looked like devils after bungled work by a rogue artist, a court heard.

Fiona Hall unwittingly visited an unregistered tattoo artist and asked for the insects, which were meant to represent a miscarriage and her daughter.

But she was left with inkings that looked like the devil and underwent a series of health checks for tests including HIV and hepatitis.

Frank Lumley, 58, pleaded guilty to carrying out unlicensed work at South Tyneside Magistrates Court.

Ms Hall expressed her anger at the markings following the conclusion of the court hearing.

She said: 'I went through a lot of pain with this and had to have a three-month sex ban and HIV and hepatitis blood tests. He went far too deep into my hand and just made a complete mess.

'The ladybirds were meant to represent my daughter and a miscarriage I had, which the person who did my hand knew.

'I have been told they resemble devil heads when they were meant to be ladybirds. I wish I had never gone into that tattoo shop that day. I was basically conned into thinking he was a registered tattooist.

'He did a bad job and I paid the price. He's got to pay me compensation now so I'm just happy he won't be messing up anybody else's body.

'I had a lot of pain and worry in case he had given me a disease and had to wait three months for results on that, and I have a five-year-old to think about.

'I'm just glad it's all over now and can think about what I am going to do to fix my hand as I am self-conscious enough with it looking like I had deliberately got bad tattoos.'

As well as the £760 in compensation, which will cover the cost of laser surgery, Lumley was also ordered to pay £100 in court fees.

Lumley did not appear in court, but in a letter he apologised for his actions and expressed 'deep regret'.

The owner of Studio 4, where she received the tattoo, told the council's licensing section he had asked Lumley if he was registered with the local authority - and had received an assurance that he was.

Speaking after the case, Lumley added: 'I just want to say that Studio 4 is a respectable, well-established business and the owner had absolutely nothing to do with this.

'It was me who pulled the wool over his eyes.' 

Debbie Lloyd, prosecuting on behalf of South Tyneside Council, said: 'On May 18 this year Fiona Hall made an inquiry to the councils licensing service, asking if Frank Lumley was registered with the council to carry out tattooing.

'Miss Hall had attended Studio 4 at Stanhope Road, South Shields, to have a tattoo and made a complaint with regard to the quality of the tattoo.

'Council records found that Mr Lumley was not registered with the local authority to carry out the business of tattooing.

'Mr Lumley was interviewed by Jeff Young of licensing services and admitted taking £20 from Miss Hall to tattoo ladybirds on her hands.'

In a letter to the court, Mr Lumley said: 'I apologise for my stupidity and I deeply regret what I have done and I will never do anything like this again.

'I am a 58-year-old man who suffers from depression and I am sorry to all concerned.' 

Council officials have urged anyone with information about 'scratchers' - illegal tattooists - to come forward.

The appeal comes as part of a drive to maintain cleanliness and hygiene standards to ensure the control of infections such as HIV and hepatitis B and C.

A council spokesman said: 'It is illegal for anybody to tattoo a member of the public without a certificate of registration.

'This case highlights the consequences of using an unregistered tattoo artist.'
