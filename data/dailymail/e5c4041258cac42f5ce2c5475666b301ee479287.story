Luis Suarez told FIFA's disciplinary panel that he did not deliberately bite Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup.

Meanwhile, football's international governing body have been formally informed of an appeal against Suarez's ban.

The Uruguay football federation will now have a further seven days to prepare the paperwork for the appeal.

Accident? Luis Suarez told FIFA he did not deliberately bite Giorgio Chiellini but fell on top of him

Big miss: FIFA have been formally informed of Uruguay's appeal against Suarez's ban

About time: Suarez has delayed his apology to Chiellini but has promised he will never behave like that again

FIFA's head of media Delia Fischer told a news conference in Rio de Janeiro: 'We have received a declaration that they are planning to appeal. They informed us of their intention to appeal yesterday (Friday) evening.

'The reasons for the appeal must now be given in writing within a deadline of seven days after the three days has expired.'

Last Wednesday, Suarez wrote a letter to the FIFA panel and said: 'In no way it happened how you have described, as a bite or intent to bite.'

'After the impact ... I lost my balance, making my body unstable and falling on top of my opponent,' Suarez wrote in his submission to the panel which met on Wednesday, one day after Uruguay beat Italy 1-0 in a decisive group-stage match.

'At that moment I hit my face against the player leaving a small bruise on my cheek and a strong pain in my teeth,' Suarez said.

However, the seven-man panel dismissed the argument. 

Painful: Suarez fell to the ground and held his teeth straight after the encounter with centre back Chiellini

FIFA suggested the punishment was so hefty because Suarez failed to show any hint of remorse for his actions.

'At no time did the player show any kind of remorse or admit to any violation of FIFA rules and therefore showed no awareness of having committed any infraction,' a FIFA document said, as reported by Brazilian newspaper Estado de Sao Paulo.

'The minimum punishment was not sufficient to have the necessary dissuasive effect.

'Previous bans did not have an effect.'

Evidence: Chiellini looked outraged as he showed the referee the apparent point of impact on his shoulder

Suarez took to Twitter on Saturday to thank his supporters and said: 'Hi all, I write this post to give thanks to the outpouring of support and love I am receiving.

'Both myself and my family really appreciate it. Thank you very much for being by my side and I want all my colleagues today to know we support seleccion for the match against Colombia.'

The bite was 'deliberate, intentional and without provocation,' the ruling stated in paragraph 26 of the panel's conclusions.

Suarez was banned from all football activities for four months and suspended for Uruguay's next nine fixtures. He was also fined.

The panel, chaired by former Switzerland international Claudio Sulser, included members from the Cook Islands, Hong Kong, Pakistan, Panama, South Africa and Singapore. 

The ruling confirmed that referee Marco Rodriguez of Mexico acknowledged in his match report that he missed Suarez's bite. So did his two assistants and the fourth official.

'I haven't seen the incident because the ball was in another sector of the pitch,' Rodriguez wrote in paragraph 4 of his witness submission in the 11-page document. 

On Saturday, Uruguay's WAGs posed with banners showing messages of support for the Liverpool frontman who has now returned to his home country.
