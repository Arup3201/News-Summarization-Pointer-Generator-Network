Coronation Street actress Claire King says she had to have a facelift to get work again because TV bosses only give roles to 'women of a certain age'.

The frank admission by the 52-year-old, who plays new character Erika Holroyd in the soap, will spark the debate about the struggles facing  older women on TV.

She was a fixture on television for 20 years but once she hit her 40s, work started to dry up. 

Claire King, pictured, left, in 2014 as Coronation Street's Erika, said she had to get a mini facelift to boost her career. Work dried up for the TV actress, pictured right in 2012, when she hit her 40s

Claire appeared on Stitch Me, Lift Me on Sky Living in February, 2013, and talked about the 'one stitch' mini-facelift she had at Harley Street Skin Clinic on Daybreak with Lorraine Kelly

The actress, who played Emmerdale villain Kim Tate for ten years, told Closer magazine: 'Things slowed down for me.

'I'd always played quite sexy characters, but TV bosses generally don't find women of a certain age sexy, so the jobs weren't there.'

She started seeing friends with 'new faces' and began to think about how a procedure might boost her career.  

In early 2013 she appeared on a Sky Living programme called Stitch Me, Lift Me, featuring the Harley Street Skin Clinic and was filmed having a mini-facelift, or a French lift.

She admits that her career has since flourished. 'I've been working pretty much non-stop ever since.'

Claire -  who's back in the soap fold playing cougar Erika, who's having an affair with Nick Tilsley in Corrie - has also gone on a health kick and given up her 60-a-day cigarette habit.

Of her facelift, she said: 'I'll admit I was nervous, but the doctor assured me it wouldn't make me look different - I'd just look like myself again.

'It was done under local anaesthetic and it wasn't painful - I was back in my hotel room an hour and a half later.' 

She also says it gave her confidence which has also helped. 'The procedure gave me a boost mentally, and people pick up on that positivity. Life's definitely begun again at 52.'

The actress says she doesn't plan to have any more cosmetic surgery.

Claire shot to fame as Emmerdale's vampy villain Kim Tate, here in 1999, and acted in the soap for ten years

Claire isn't the first famous face to raise the issue of employment on screen over the age of 40.

Former BBC presenter Miriam O'Reilly successfully sued the corporation for age discrimination after she was dropped from hosting Countryfile.

She said middle aged women were not wanted by BBC bosses.
