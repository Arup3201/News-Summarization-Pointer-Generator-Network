Carnival Corp has been hit with its first lawsuit over the 'horrifying' conditions passengers were forced to endure when the Triumph cruise became stranded following an engine fire.

Cassie Terry of Brazoria County, Texas filed the suit less than 24 hours after arriving on dry land in Mobile, Alabama, alleging that she was forced to wade through  human feces from overflowing toilets.

Her suit also claimed Carnival failed to provide a seaworthy vessel and sanitary conditions.

She suffered physical and emotional harm, including anxiety, nervousness and the loss of the enjoyment of life, according to the complaint filed in federal court in Miami.

Whether lawsuits will be successful has been doubted by legal analysts, who have speculated passengers will find it difficult to 
sue Carnival for any damages thanks to a legal structure 
shielding operators from big-money lawsuits.

Many will have unknowingly signed 
Carnival's contracts prohibiting them from class action lawsuits, while 
the small print also bans them suing on the grounds of emotional 
distress, lawyers explained.

It
comes as the company offered each customer a compensation package and 
issued an apology on Thursday - which many disgruntled passengers deemed
too flimsy and too late.

There has also been no sign of Carnival Corp Chairman and CEO Micky 
Arison, who was criticised in January last year for failing to travel to 
Italy and take personal charge of the Costa Concordia crisis.

It seems he has not learned from his mistakes, as he has failed to publicly comment on the Triumph incident and was not on the scene as the massive vessel docked in Mobile, Alabama on Thursday.

Carnival has offered all guests:

No doubt adding insult to injury, he was last seen on Tuesday at the  American Airlines Arena as he watched a game between the Portland Trail Blazers and the Miami Heat, which he owns.

His glaring absence could make customers more likely to lash out against the company in the courts.

But for all their grievances, they may struggle to sue the operator, which has headquarters in both Florida and England, for any damages, analysts have speculated.

Tickets issued by Carnival and other 
cruise companies contain language limiting how much a passenger can recover in a suit.

Jim Walker, with Miami-based Cruise Law News, told CTV News: 'Over decades the lawyers for cruise lines have drafted these contracts to really strip away all the rights of cruise passengers.'

Walker said he has been contacted by Triumph passengers about potential suits, but he said he expects few will make it to court.

'There are certainly people who want lawsuits to be filed,' he said. 'But if you have received full compensation for the cruise, cruise credit, a little cash compensation on top of that - we certainly wouldn't be trying to do any better than that because the rights of the passengers are restricted.'

He added that being upset by a journey is not grounds to sue - but becoming ill or injured is.

While there have been no physical 
injuries, if a person contracted a disease from 
unsanitary conditions on the ship, they could argue for physical injury, maritime trial attorney John H. Hickey told CNN. And due to the conditions on board, many could have been at risk of these diseases.

'I think that a case can be made that
everyone on that ship is at risk of actual physical injury,' he said, 
adding that the cruise line will no doubt want to diffuse the situation 
as quickly as possible.

'Do 
these people want to take what Carnival is offering and get on with 
their lives, or do they want to get into a long legal 
struggle that may not yield the results they want?' he said.

Jason R. 
Margulies, an experienced maritime lawyer based in Miami, added that Carnival has printed a prohibition on class action 
suits in its tickets, which would have only been typed in the small 
print.

A U.S. statute prohibits operators from putting such language on tickets, but 
Carnival is incorporated outside the 
United States, partly in Panama and Great Britain, he said.

Carnival said 
passengers will be reimbursed in full plus transportation expenses, a 
future cruise credit equal to the amount they paid, plus a 
payment of $500 a person to help compensate them.

But Robin Chandler, a 50-year-old from Dallas who spent her birthday on the ship, scoffed at the compensation offer.

'There are lost wages, 
I've got a baby sitter at home and I had to take off work,' she said. 
'The stench was awful. A lot of people were crying and freaking out.'

Some litigation could rest 
on the outcome of an investigation into the fire, which started in the 
engine room last Sunday and knocked out the ship's power.

There are questions over why the 
incident took out power on the 14-year-old ship, which had mechanical 
troubles last month that delayed a similar cruise to Mexico.

Company officials said the two episodes were not related, but their proximity could help customers in their pursuit of compensation, experts said.

Many may fight for it following the disgusting conditions they were forced to endure, but Carnival's Chief Executive Gerry Cahill attempted damage control by stepping on the vessel last night.

'I know the conditions on board were very
poor,' he told reporters. 'I know it was difficult. I want to 
apologize for subjecting our guests to that.

'We pride ourselves with providing our guests with a great vacation 
experience and clearly we failed in this particular case.'
