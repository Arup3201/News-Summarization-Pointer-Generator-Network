Joe DiMaggio's love letter to Marilyn Monroe has sold for $78,125 at a Beverly Hills auction.

Julien's Auctions in Beverly Hills says the letter, written by the baseball great after Monroe announced she was divorcing him, was sold Saturday to an undisclosed buyer.

The letter during their brief, volatile marriage was among 300 items, dubbed 'Marilyn Monroe's Lost Archives,' that went on the block.

A handwritten letter from Monroe to her third and final husband, playwright Arthur Miller, sold for $43,750.

Monroe, who died of a drug overdose at age 36 in 1962, willed the collection of letters to her mentor, the legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg.

Also up for auction was an old prescription pill bottle from a pharmacy in Bedford.

The collection of belongings - which also includes her supposedly-favorite black coat, circa mid-1950s, photographs and other memorabilia - were until now kept by her mentor and coach Lee Strasberg, who died in 1982.

 'We are all in awe of this opportunity to offer such a rare collection and glimpse into Marilyn Monroe’s life,' said Martin Nolan, Executive Director of Julien’s Auctions. 

'You can’t help but get emotional on several levels when you have the chance to read the letters and view some of the photographs and witness Marilyn’s own attempt at correspondence.'

The collection is a strange glimpse into the late screen goddess' private world.

Arguably the most insightful item is a letter from Joe DiMaggio, written after the baseball star learned his wife wanted a divorce.

Monroe made the announcement during a press conference in 1954, nine months after their wedding. 

'He writes this amazing letter, beautiful handwriting, very impressive,' Nolan told CCTV. 

'But his first and foremost number one concern was he truly loved Marilyn, but he was concerned for her welfare, he felt she looked as though she was about to collapse. 

'He didn't like to see her crying. And then he expressed his love, he expresses his regret and apologies if he had anyway hurt her. 

'And he is begging her to come back to him. So it's a true love letter.' 

The most expensive item at the auction is said to be Monroe's favorite - a coat she wore consistently in the mid-1950s.

The piece originally sold as part of her estate in 1999, but was expected to fetch at least $120,000.

Favorite: This coat is said to have been Monroe's go-to and she wore it consistently 

The auction included love letters, photographs, personal items, personal records and documents and other memorabilia

Classic: A three-panel sterling silver custom-made Cartier frame, gifted to Marilyn Monroe by Nedda and Joshua Logan. Inside is a picture taken by Cecil Beaton in 1956, along with a letter from him describing her
