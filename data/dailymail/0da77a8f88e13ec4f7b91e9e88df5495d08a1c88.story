A pair of robbers who kidnapped a 62-year-old man by locking him in the boot of his own car before leaving the victim inside, nine miles from his home, have been jailed for 19 years.

The crooks then demanded £50,000 from the man because they wrongly believed he was a drug dealer. When he could not give them the money, the pair tied him up with a dressing gown cord, a court heart.

Alexander Blake, 22, and Ryan Blakeney, 23, barged into the unsuspecting victim's home in Dorridge, West Midlands on April 10 last year.

Alexander Blake and Ryan Blakeney attempted to extort £50,000 out of a man they wrongly believed to be a drug dealer. When he could not pay, the pair kidnapped the man in his own car and left him stranded in its boot

They then used a plastic cable and a 
dressing gown cord to tie the victim up before threatening him with a 
knife and boiling water.

After searching the man's home, the robbers that realised it was a case of mistaken identity and that they had targeted the wrong person so reduced their demands to £20,000 and then £10,000.

They proceeded to steal a fake Rolex watch and £150 from the victim's pocket before bundling him into the boot of his car and driving east towards Birmingham.

A court heart that Blake had then boasted about the watch saying in text messages that he had acquired a 'Rolly'.

Forensic examination of his phone also showed that he had sent photos of the
 fake watch to contacts.

The duo then left the man stranded in the Tyseley area, south east of the city centre, but the victim managed to wriggle free and call police on his mobile.

Officers found the victim in the early hours of April 11. In the days after the kidnapping, he received 13 calls and three text messages from the robbers demanding cash.

Police intelligence led detectives to identify Blake, who lived in Tyseley, Birmingham as a key suspect and he was arrested on April 17 by officers outside a Job Centre after he had signed on.

Blakeney, from Lee Bank in north east Birmingham, was arrested on May 1 by officers who spotted him bolting from a rear door during a search of a property.

The pair denied charges of robbery, kidnap and blackmail but were found guilty at Birmingham Crown Court.

Alexander Blake's mother Joyce Blake tried to give her son an alibi, claiming that he had been with her on the night of the robbery, a court heart

Blake was ordered to serve 11 years behind bars, with his accomplice Blakeney jailed for eight years.

The jury failed to reach a decision on a third suspect, Hanif Tuitt-Sinclair, 23, of Sheldon, Birmingham.

After a second hung jury yesterday, prosecutors chose not to pursue a third trial and reporting restrictions on Blake and Blakeney were lifted.

The court heard CCTV footage showed Blakeney performing a recce of the victim's home and the hire car used to drive the pair to the property on the night of the robbery was even booked in his mother's name.

Blake was joined behind bars by his mother Joyce Blake, 53, and girlfriend Anesha Masikane-Cummins, 23, who tried to give him an alibi.

The court heard the pair approached police on October 7 last year claiming he spent the night at home with them in Tyseley at the time of the kidnap.

But phone analysis showed Masikane-Cummins was in Erdington, Birmingham, that night and even sent a message to Blake at 1am on April 11 saying 'wat u duin'.

Joyce Blake, of Tyseley, and Masikane-Cummins, of Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, were both jailed for two years and 18 months after they pleaded guilty to attempting to pervert the course of justice.

Blake's girlfriend Anesha Maiskane-Cummins was also handed two years and 18 months for attempting to pervert the courts of justice

After the hearing, Detective Superintendent Simon Wallis, from West Midlands Police, said: 'These are extremely serious crimes.

'It
 was a case of mistaken identity and, unfortunately for all involved, 
they targeted a completely innocent man who has no connections to drug 
dealing.

'Blake's mother and girlfriend plotted to invent a false alibi in an attempt to put him in the clear.

'But we were quickly able to expose their lies and they too are now paying a heavy price for trying to pervert the course of justice.

'Lying to police or the courts is very serious. Anyone attempted to do so must be aware that their actions could cost them their liberty.'
