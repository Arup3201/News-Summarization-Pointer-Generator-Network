A Florida judge on Thursday declared a multimillionaire legally dead, nearly three years after he went missing while out sailing in rough seas.

Oil and gas tycoon Guma Aguiar, 35, vanished from Fort Lauderdale at sunset on June 19, 2012, just hours after his wife allegedly threatened him with a divorce.

His 31-foot boat T.T. Zion washed ashore the next day on a beach with the lights on and its engine on full throttle. Police found Aguiar’s cell phone and wallet aboard the vessel, but there was no sign of the married father of four.

Days after Aguiar's mysterious disappearance, his wife and mother went to war for control of his $100million fortune.

But this week the two women temporarily put their differences aside and submitted a joint petition asking a Broward County judge to officially declare Aguiar dead so they could gain access to his estate.

After hearing testimony from Jamie and Ellen Aguiar, as well as from the lead detective investigating the missing-person case, Judge Mark Speiser granted the women's request.

'The legal battles are settled and resolved,' attorney Albert Frevola representing Aguiar's now-widow told Sun-Sentinel. 'And the survivors will be able to move on with their lives.'

The petition to have Aguiar declared dead states that he accidentally fell overboard and drowned. His body was never recovered.

His wife, Jamie, broke down in tears in court Wednesday as she described the day she learned of her husband's disappearance.

‘The police showed up at our house and said they found his boat had washed ashore,’ said Jamie Aguiar, reported CBS Miami.

Mrs Aguiar also said that her husband’s bank accounts have been dormant for nearly three years, providing further proof that he was dead.

Guma Aguilar, a Brazilian-born Jewish philanthropist, made his fortune in 2006 when his Texas-based oil and gas exploration company, Leor Energy, sold for a reported $2.55billion.

His home in Fort Lauderdale is valued at $5million, he had seven cars valued at $1.1million and a yacht called Zion worth $2.1million.

The missing magnate was born to Jewish parents but was raised as an Evangelical Christian.

Aguiar has donated $8million in the past to Nefesh b'Nefesh, an organization that helps American and British Jews move to Israel, and was also a large supporter of the 'March of the Living' - an educational program in Poland and Israel designed to continue public awareness of the Holocaust in those countries.

He also became a regular on Israeli sports pages when he invested $4 million into Israeli Premier League soccer team Beitar Jerusalem in July 2009.

In September 2009, Aguiar also purchased Jerusalem's leading basketball franchise Hapoel Jerusalem for $1.5million.

Despite his family and business interests, Aguiar has a history of mental illness and was admitted to an Israeli psychiatric hospital after claiming to know a soldier in Israel who had been abducted by the terrorist group Hamas.

He was on probation for domestic violence when he disappeared.

The multi-millionaire had reportedly argued with his wife, when she is said to have threatened him with a divorce, hours before he disappeared.

A lawyer for Guma Aguiar's mother, Ellen, said the wealthy humanitarian was in low spirits when he went out on his boat that fateful Tuesday in June, after receiving the blow from Jamie - a claim the wife has repeatedly denied.

The 35-year-old man had spoken with his mother an hour before he got on to his 31-foot boat, the T.T. Zion, and sailed off on June 19.

A surveillance video showed Aguiar alone aboard the boat as it made its way through Port Everglades at high speeds.

According to police, Aguiar began having steering trouble due to equipment malfunction.

GPS data began tracking Aguiar at 7.29pm after he had left the inlet by his house. He traveled northeast for nearly 30 minutes into the open ocean.

At 7.56pm, the 31-foot vessel suddenly made an ominously abrupt turn, slowing to speeds below 3mph.

The yacht was controlled by a person until 7.54am, when both its engines died.

About six hours after Aguiar sped off in his boat, it was discovered abandoned on the beach next to a bar with its navigation lights on and the keys still in the ignition.
