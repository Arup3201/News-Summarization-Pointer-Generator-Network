Marlon Brando as an aging Don Corleone, wearing his trademark fedora, now on sale

Marlon Brando's famous fedora, worn by him in his role as Mafia kingpin Vito Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's award winning film The Godfather, has emerged for sale for $100,000.

Brando's portrayal of the Sicilian Mafia Don in the 1972 classic was one of the most celebrated performances of all time, winning him an Oscar for best actor.

The film won three Oscars, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, ranking only second behind the Orson Wells movie Citizen Kane.

Made from grey felt, the fedora was one of the important props that Brando used in the film, to make his character of Don Corleone, the head of a powerful Mafia family, as debonair as he was fearsome.

The hat is made by famous manufacturer Stetson, a company ordinarily known for making cowboy style hats seen in other classic Hollywood movies like westerns.

It has been given an estimated value of $50,000, but experts think that it will likely go for double that amount, when it is sold by a U.S. private collector in an internet auction.

Laura Yntema, from Los Angeles-based auctioneers Nate D Sanders, said: 'Props from movies made in the 1970s, the golden age of modern cinema, 
like the Godfather are very rare.

'Back then props weren't really held onto once filming was over and very few survived.

'Thankfully this hat, worn by Marlon Brando in his famous role as Vito Corleone, was one of the props that did.

The iconic hat is in good shape, but will likely form part of somebody's personal film memorabilia collection

'The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made and Vito Corleone is its best known character.

'This hat is probably in the top 25 movie props of all time and is hugely desirable.

'The fedora is the symbol of the Mafia gangster and there is none more famous than Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone.

'We've given it an estimate of $50,000 but something this rare could easily go for $100,000.'

The hat is famous for most people for its appearance in the Godfather, but it seems it can also be seen in pictures from his younger days.

The Godfather was the first of a trilogy of films based on the series of crime novels following the Corleone family by writer Mario Puzo.

Puzo also provided help for the film, who based the characters in the Corleone family on experiences during his time as a crime reporter.

The sequel, The Godfather Part II, was released in 1974 and saw Robert DeNiro play a young Vito Corleone, and won six Oscars including best picture and best director.

The Godfather Part III was released 16 years later in 1990, completing the story of Vito's son Michael, played by Al Pacino, and his time as the head of the Corleone family, and was largely critically panned when it was released.

The auction ends on March 27.
