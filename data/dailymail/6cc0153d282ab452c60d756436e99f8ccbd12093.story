A couple who raised two deadly cheetahs in their home, are now teaching the pair to hunt so that they can be released back into the wild - by playing football with them.

Kim and Hein Schoeman, who took the cubs into their South African home a year ago, are using a plastic ball to train the cheetahs and bizarrely their mad method appears to be working.

The pair, both 29, first started caring for the wild cats when a cheetah at the Garden Route Game Lodge gave birth to four cubs.

Fetch: A couple who raised two deadly cheetahs in their home, are now teaching the pair to hunt so that they can be released back into the wild - by playing football with them

In training: Kim and Hein Schoeman, who took the cubs into their South African home a year ago, are using a plastic ball to train the cheetahs

Start of relationship: The pair, both 29, first started caring for the wild cats when a cheetah at the Garden Route Game Lodge, gave birth to four cubs

The mother was only able to provide for half of her litter so the duo stepped in and have been raising the cubs ever since, alongside their children, Malan and Kayla, who were then just two years and three months old.

Twelve months on, the extraordinary couple are now using some unusual methods to teach the deadly cheetahs to hunt for themselves before they are reintroduced into the wild in about 18 months.

The husband and wife team started with the basics by encouraging the cheetahs to chase a football, first around their garden and then down a hill at the reserve.Â

Game plan: Hein said 'We started off by developing the skills of chasing, catching and holding, those three movements are probably the most important'

Kim and Hein then progressed onto simulating ambushes, with Kim moving towards a group of springbok, while Hein hides with the two cats, waiting for the perfect opportunity to attack.

Hein believes that playing football with the cheetahs helps them learn the fundamental techniques needed to become a successful hunter.

Hein said: 'We started off by developing the skills of chasing, catching and holding, those three movements are probably the most important.

'Regardless of their speed, without having the ability to catch and hold their prey, their hunt would be for nothing.

Preparation: As part of the training Kim moves towards a group of springbok, while Hein hides with the two cats, waiting for the perfect opportunity to attack

Time to begin: Kim checks the harness on of the cubs before they start a day's work

Training: 'Regardless of their speed, without having the ability to catch and hold their prey, their hunt would be for nothing,' says Hein

Taking a break: Having almost mastered the basics, the couple are now trying to teach the cheetahs the mental requirements for hunting such as patience and limitations

'By hunting quickly, and more importantly, efficiently, cheetahs make hunting seem like an easy task.'

Having almost mastered the basics, the couple are now trying to teach the cheetahs the mental requirements for hunting such as patience and limitations.

Kim said: 'They see something and they think that if they start to run they'll catch it, which is not the case at all. They'll never catch it.

'So they need to know that they've got as close as possible before they start running.

'It takes a while for them to learn what their limitations are and exactly what they're looking at.

'Wild cheetahs don't take chances because they know that their strength lies in their speed rather than their physical strength.

'Their mother, when she was younger, was hunting things twice her size. She is as good as it gets so they've inherited some good traits.'

At two and a half years old the cheetahs will be fully grown (twice their current size) and it is hoped they will have developed enough successful hunting skills to be released.

Despite their ability to accelerate up to speeds of 120 kilometres per hour in short spurts, cheetahs are ambush predators, they trick their prey rather than chase them in a straight line.

Watchful eye: Hein watches as the cheetahs attack during their training

Time to learn: The pair are walked along the grass before their training begins

Attack: The cheetahs pounce on their prey

Speed: A cheetah running for the ball as the training gets underway in the hot sun

Future: At two and a half years old the cheetahs will be fully grown (twice their current size) and it is hoped they will have developed enough successful hunting skills to be released

Speeds: Despite their ability to accelerate up to speeds of 120 kilometres per hour in short spurts, cheetahs are ambush predators, they trick their prey rather than chase them in a straight line

Time out: The cheetahs relax after a hard day's training
