The campaign to save the Union has more than doubled its lead to a record high following Alex Salmond's TV debate meltdown, a sensational new poll has revealed.

An exclusive survey for the Scottish Daily Mail has found that viewers overwhelmingly believe Alistair Darling crushed his opponent, and nearly a quarter of those who watched are now more likely to reject independence.

At the end of a torrid week for the SNP, Mr Salmond now has only 39 days of campaigning to revive his lifeless bid to break-up Britain before the historic referendum on September 18.

The poll, carried out after the live debate between Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond and Better Together campaign leader Alistair Darling, shows nearly a quarter of viewers are now more likely to reject independence

The shock Survation poll, carried out on Wednesday and Thursday, shows that opposition to separation has soared to 50 per cent for the first time since the firm began asking the question.

That is a remarkable four point increase in the space of a single week, with only 37 per cent now in favour of a Yes vote – down three points. When undecided voters are excluded, the No camp is on 57 per cent – a massive 14-point lead over Yes, compared to just a six-point lead last Sunday.

Mr Salmond's failure to answer questions about the currency of an independent Scotland is at the heart of the dramatic collapse.

More than two-thirds of the 1,010 Scots polled by Survation said the First Minister should produce a 'plan B' to his unrealistic bid to keep the pound before voters cast their ballots.

Asked to pick adjectives to describe the SNP leader's performance in the pivotal STV debate last Tuesday – which was watched by 1.7million people – the most popular choices were 'weak', 'uninformed' and 'dishonest'.

His opponent, former Chancellor Mr Darling who is spearheading the Better Together campaign, was described as 'knowledgeable' and 'strong'.

Mr Salmond's leadership is now under unprecedented scrutiny, with senior SNP figures privately briefing against him throughout the week and some suggesting his deputy Nicola Sturgeon should replace him for a crunch TV debate on the BBC later this month.

Alarmingly for the First Minister, 15 per cent of Scots who backed the SNP in the 2011 Holyrood election would be more likely to vote Yes in the referendum if Miss Sturgeon was the leader.

A staggering 45 per cent of independence supporters now believe Miss Sturgeon should represent the Yes camp in the BBC debate on August 25.

And to compound the crisis for Mr Salmond, the collapse in support is largely due to huge numbers of female voters who have switched to the No camp in recent days.

Patrick Briône, director of research at Survation, said: 'Following his unexpected success in the debate, Alistair Darling has seen support for No jump to its highest ever level in a Survation poll, at 50 per cent and a 13-point lead.

'Whilst this post-debate boost may fade over time, with little over a month remaining until Scots head to the polls it looks as though Alex Salmond is fast running out of time to turn things around. Barring a dramatic reversal in the next debate, the dreams of Scottish nationalists appear increasingly likely to be dashed come September 18.'

During a visit to Glasgow yesterday, Labour leader Ed Miliband told the Mail: 'I think what this shows is that Tuesday night was a very big moment because of Alistair's persistent and very forensic questioning. Alex Salmond was exposed on a central question about the referendum and an independent Scotland's currency.

'I think what has been laid bare is that he has no plan, he has no answers, and I think a lot of people seeking to make up their minds in this referendum will be thinking this is just too big a risk when there's no answer on the currency.'

Mr Darling added: 'What's happening is the closer we get to polling day, the more people are making their minds up and saying No thanks to the risks and costs of independence, and seeing the advantages that we can have.

'We're not complacent, but I'm increasingly confident that we're going to win this.'

The findings come less than a week since Yes Scotland chiefs said a Survation poll for the Scottish Mail on Sunday put them 'within touching distance of success on September 18'. But the new figures suggest that even convincing every undecided voter to back separation may not be enough for victory.

According to the poll, 49 per cent of men plan to vote No, with 41 per cent in favour of independence. Among women, 52 per cent plan to reject separation – up six points in a week – and only 33 per cent said they will vote Yes.

Younger voters aged 16 to 24 have also overwhelmingly swung behind the No camp, with 60 per cent now in favour of the Union – up from 43 per cent last Sunday.

There are also more supporters of the Union than opponents in most regions of Scotland, including the key battleground of Glasgow.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said he believes it has been 'laid bare' that Alex Salmond 'has no plan'

Asked about Tuesday's TV debate, Survation found that 65 per cent of the 1,010 respondents had watched the show. Of those who saw the live clash, 53 per cent believe Mr Darling won, compared to just 28 per cent who picked Mr Salmond.

Even among those planning to vote Yes to independence, the First Minister was seen as the victor by fewer than two-thirds of respondents.

Asked if the debate had changed how they intend to vote, 13 per cent said they were more likely to back separation, but 22 per cent said they were more likely to cross the 'No' box on the ballot paper.

Mr Salmond can take some comfort in his personal ratings figures, with 39 per cent of Scots satisfied with the way he is doing his job as First Minister, compared to just 19 per cent who are satisfied with David Cameron's job as Prime Minister.

Mr Salmond was also considered the best representative for Yes Scotland by 32 per cent of voters, with only 23 per cent picking his deputy Miss Sturgeon.

A Yes Scotland spokesman said: 'The poll shows most Scots agree with us that the Westminster parties are bluffing on currency - and a majority want an independent Scotland to keep the pound, which is exactly what will happen. 

'The polls will always fluctuate, but what they all show is that support for Yes is well above 40 per cent - and we are very confident our positive message that a Yes vote is Scotland's one opportunity to protect the NHS, create more jobs here and guarantee that Scotland no longer gets landed with Tory governments we reject, will win a majority on September 18.'
