One of Australia's most extraordinary properties, the Small House - a stunning five storey property, which has been built on a once pint sized car park, is set to go under the hammer.

The cosy one bedroom house, situated in Sydney's inner city, which has featured on Grand Designs Australia, is on the market with a grand price tag of $1.875 million.

South Australian Architect Domenic Alvaro and his partner Sue Bassett, who admit to loving the inner city suburb of Surry Hills, had a gigantic dream to build big, but 'they had to go up'.

The Living area : five floors of stunning home, the Small house is set to go under the hammer. Acclaimed architect, Domenic Alvaro bought a minuscule 42 square metre block in a lane way which used to be a tiny car park and built up for the ultimate of city living in Sydney's inner city Surry Hills

The acclaimed architect bought a minuscule 42 square metre block in a lane way in 2008 for over $200,000 and set to work building a light filled living space.

In 2011, Small House, became the world house of the year, awarded at the World architecture festival in Barcelona and was not only been credited for its exceptional architectural and interiors features, but also for presenting a solution to the long-standing issue of urban sprawl.

On his company website, Mr Alvaro says the Small House investigates a new typology in the current urban living space, while still reflecting a contemporary lifestyle full of diversity and creativity.

And the best thing about it, it's low maintenance and the ultimate key to city living.

The memorable project was featured in the first series of Grand Designs Australia - with the lifestyle program revisiting the Alvaros last year.

'What the house did was highlight what can be achieved within urban densification, which on a grand scale I think Australia has been slow to embrace,' said TV host and architect Peter Maddison.

The unusual five storey building features a master bathroom on the first level and bedroom, while on level two and three there's the lounge and living areas, level four is the kitchen, while on the top level there is a rooftop garden with a few plants.

The Small house will go under the hammer on October 18.
