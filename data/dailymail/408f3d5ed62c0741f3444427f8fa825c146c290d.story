Most GPs think that NHS treatment for migrants is ‘too generous’ and are refusing to register some patients who are in this country illegally.

Some doctors warn that surgeries ‘can’t cope’ with the rising numbers of overseas patients coming in for free care, a poll has found.

Last year new NHS guidelines told GPs they had to register all foreigners including tourists on short holidays, students and illegal immigrants.

Welcome? Most GPs think that NHS treatment for migrants is 'too generous' and refuse to register some patients who are in this country illegally

Once signed up, they would be entitled to the same NHS care as all other patients and can receive free blood tests, jabs and - in some cases - free prescription drugs.

But a poll of 229 family doctors by Pulse magazine found that 58 per cent believe these rules are too generous.

And 36 per cent will refuse to register patients they suspect are living here illegally - even though they are breaching these new guidelines.

One unnamed doctor warned the health service would come under increasing strain next year when thousands of Bulgarians and Romanians arrive to find jobs.

It is estimated that as many as 70,000 migrants from these two countries will come to Britain when temporary controls on their numbers expire.

The senior GP said: ‘There is an increasing burden of patients coming to the UK who are entitled to treatment - but whether we can afford an open-ended system in the future is a matter for debate.

‘The UK has got to decide what it can and can’t afford and who is eligible. The problem is that everyone tiptoes around the issue.

‘I treat a lot of migrants and asylum seekers, quite happily, but I think there needs to be a public debate.

‘It’s going to become an increasing issue as we get people from countries like Bulgaria and Romania becoming eligible for NHS treatment in 2014.’

Dr Paul Roblin, a GP who practises in Botley, near Oxford said: ‘You could argue whether it is fair for visitors and migrants to have entitlement to NHS treatment when that is not reciprocated.’

‘GPs are expected to practise with limited healthcare funding and if we are using that money for treating visitors, the taxpayer loses out. It may be more appropriate to have a system where we say that if you can’t provide proof of residence, you have to pay for treatment.’

The rules regarding overseas patients are extremely complex and even doctors struggle to understand them.

By law, such patients are not allowed free hospital treatment - unless urgent -and should be made to pay for x-rays, operations and appointments.

But there is concern that once foreign patients are registered with a GP, they can easily access free hospital care as staff rarely check their backgrounds.

Figures show that foreign patients owe the NHS £40 million in unpaid hospital bills.

Last year nearly 3,600 ‘overseas visitors’ have had hospital operations or treatment worth at least £1,000 a time.

The Department of Health is currently reviewing the provision of NHS treatment for foreigners and may decide to charge them for ‘primary care,’ or GP services.

A spokesman said: ‘The review is looking at whether we could introduce charges into primary care and how that would work.’
