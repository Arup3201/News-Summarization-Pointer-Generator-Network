With her long legs and trim figure, model Jo from Oxfordshire has a body many women would envy. 

But even models get hang-ups about their appearance and for Jo, it was her 'muffin top'. She felt she had fat hanging over her waistline that made her feel self-conscious when doing bikini shoots.

But the solution the 22-year-old sought to boost her confidence left her self-esteem lower than ever.

Bad result: Jo was left with red and lumpy scars after having liposuction

Risk: The angry scars were a result of Jo getting an infection after her treatment

She said: 'The procedure that was meant to improve my confidence has left me feeling worse than I did beforehand.

'From a young age I was conscious of my 'muffin top' so I went for liposuction thinking it would improve my confidence.'

Jo spent £2,600 to have the cosmetic procedure where fat is sucked from the body.

She booked the treatment and paid for 
it in advance but by the time she went to have it, she had lost some 
pounds naturally so it was no longer necessary. However as she didn't 
want to lose her money she went through with it regardless.

She said: 'When I went to my consultant I felt I 
didn't need it but I had already paid all the money up front. I would
have lost that if I didn't do it so I felt I had to go through with it.
I wish I had thought about it more.'

Last chance: Jo meets Mr Vijh who she hopes can solve her problem

Diagnosis: The surgeon said the scars should have faded after two years and the only option would be to cut them out

Liposuction involves making incisions in the skin so a suction tube can then be inserted to suck fat out.

As with all surgery, the treatment comes with a risk of the wounds getting infected afterwards and unfortunately for Jo, this happened to her.

After treatment for the infection she was left with lumpy, red scars that still hadn't faded two years after the liposuction. 

Three weeks later: After Mr Vijh's treatment, Jo's scar are fainter and not as lumpy as they were before

She said: 'They're red and inflamed and lumpy and can be quite sore. The procedure has been so disappointing and left me feeling self conscious.'

The scars also affected the work Jo felt she could take on in her modelling career.

Jo hoped the TLC TV show Last Chance Salon could be her salvation.

She revealed her scars to the show's resident cosmetic surgeon Mr Vik Vijh who said, 'they should have gone by now.'

He said the only solution would be for Jo to go under the knife again under local anesthetic so he could cut out the old scars.

The treatment was a success and Jo returned to the Salon three weeks later to show off the results.

Her scars were now less red, painful and lumpy and Mr Vijh told her they would continue to fade as time passed.

Confidence restored: The scars will continue to fade and the model now feels ready to return to doing bikini shoots

Jo revealed that the treatment had given her the confidence boost she needed and as a result, she had secured a job in Marbella over the summer modelling swimwear.

She said: 'I'm really excited I'm going to be 
modelling bikinis in Marbella. It's something I would never have been able to do 
as the scars were before.'
