Hapless: Liam Darby's own barrister described his actions as 'idiotic' at Portsmouth Crown Court

A hapless armed robber was such a regular at the betting shop he tried to hold up that staff thought he was joking and asked him: 'Liam, what are you doing?'

The Ladbrokes cashiers initially thought Liam Darby was playing a prank when he stormed into their shop with a rock and demanded money, a court heard.

But when assistant Wayne Newman realised he was serious he handed over £1,600 - most of which Darby dropped on the way out.

Just minutes before he'd tried to rob the nearby Co-op supermarket where staff just ignored him and told him to go away.

The 20-year-old raider was a regular punter on the gambling machines in the betting shop, in Gosport, Hampshire.

And he was even easier to recognise than most customers because he has distinctive shaved eyebrows and a tattoo on his neck.

His own barrister, Barry McElduff, even described his actions as 'idiotic', at Portsmouth Crown Court.

He
said: 'One can scarcely think of a robbery of a shop that was more 
likely to come undone than Mr Darby’s behaviour in his local Ladbrokes.

'This
is a place that he regularly goes into and a place that when he 
approached the counter the staff thought he was joking to begin with 
because they know him so well.'

He added: 'Having been given the money by the employee, Mr Darby is so drunk he is dropping the money as he leaves the store.'

The baffled shop assistant told him: 'What are you doing, you come in here all the time, you’re on CCTV.'

But Darby, from Gosport, was determined to get his hands on some cash.

Minutes before the raid on Ladbrokes, he had gone into a nearby Co-op supermarket where he botched another robbery.

There, he had used a can to threaten staff but they ignored his demands for cash and told him to get out.

As he left the Co-op he threatened a customer who also refused to hand his money over, telling Darby to 'just walk away'.

The father-of-one was arrested four days later on March 12.

Darby, who has previous convictions for theft and assault, pleaded guilty to robbery and attempted robbery.

Mr McElduff added: 'They were drunken, idiotic, spur-of-the-moment offences for which Mr Darby hangs his head in shame.'

The court heard Darby had been given a number of community orders which he had breached.

Sentencing him to two-and-a-half-years in a young offenders’ institute, Recorder Stuart Jones QC said: 'You have thrown away a lot of chances.

'These offences mark a serious escalation in your criminal behaviour.

'If you have any sense at all you will behave yourself.'
