The two men accused of murdering Fusilier Lee Rigby in the Woolwich terror attack pleaded not guilty yesterday.

His widow Rebecca Rigby, 30, was in the Old Bailey to see the alleged killers appear via video link from Belmarsh Prison.

Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, pleaded not guilty to murdering her 25-year-old husband near his army barracks in Woolwich, south east London, in May.

The pair also denied separate counts of attempting to murder police officers who arrived at the scene in Woolwich.

The pair sat in separate rooms for the hearing, with Mrs Rigby sitting in the court’s public gallery.

Wearing red t-shirts and black jogging bottoms, Adebolajo and Adebowale asked to be addressed by their adopted Islamic names of Al Mujaahid Abu Hamza and Ismail Ibn Abdullah respectively.

After hearing submissions from the two barristers representing the defendants, the court allowed them to be called by their Muslim names  as well.

Attacked: Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was killed as he walked in Woolwich, on May 22

Adebowale, of Greenwich, and Adebolajo, from Romford, Essex, were remanded into custody and will stand trial at the Old Bailey on November 18.

Fusilier Rigby, from Middleton, in Lancashire, died from multiple cut and stab wounds shortly after 2pm on May 22 in Artillery Place as he walked to the barracks. Drummer Rigby fought the Taliban during a tour of duty as a machine gunner in Afghanistan.

The soldier, who had served with the 2nd Battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers since 2006, was estranged from his wife Rebecca at the time of his death.

They married in 2007 when he was based at Catterick Garrison and she gave birth to their son Jack three years later.

Paying
tribute to him earlier this year, Mrs Rigby said: ‘I just want to say 
that I love Lee, I always will and I am proud to be his wife.

‘He was due to come home this weekend so we could continue our future together as a family. He was a devoted father to Jack and we both miss him terribly.’

Several days after his death, it emerged that he was engaged to Aimee West, a soldier who was serving in Afghanistan.

Miss West, 22, flew back from Afghanistan after the attack and left a poignant tribute on the spot where he died.
