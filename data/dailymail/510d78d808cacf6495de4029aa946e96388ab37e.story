Scientists have found evidence of 98 deaths and more graves than they previously thought at a Florida boys' reform school, where students were allegedly brutally beaten, raped and murdered.

Researchers from the University of South Florida in Tampa found at least 50 grave shafts at the Dozier School for Boys in Marianna, Florida - 19 more than had been identified by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement in a 2010 investigation.

In total, scientists believe a minimum of 96 children - aged from six to 18 - and two adults died between 1911 and the 1973 at the infamous school, with many of the burials going undocumented.

And there could be even more victims: Researchers do not have access to records after 1960 because of privacy laws, and overgrowth on the grounds has hindered them from full searches.

Horrors: Crosses mark graves at a cemetery at Dozier School for Boys in Marianna, Florida. Investigators have said they had found at least 50 graves - 19 more than officially reported - on the grounds

A report released on Monday details the alleged cover-ups by the school, which opened in 1900.

It was closed in June 2011 by the Department of Juvenile Justice after a years-long controversy over widespread physical and sexual abuse.

The horrifying findings - and expectations of still more to come - raise troubling questions for the now-shuttered school, its staff and the state.

Previous investigations and lawsuits 
have been brought by the 'White House Boys' - so called because much of 
the abuse took place in an 11-room building known as the White House.

Scene: Students called themselves the White House Boys as much of the abuse took place in this building

Investigation: Researchers believe that 96 boys died at the school and expect to find more burial sites

A group of former students sued the 
state in 2010, but their case was dismissed as the statute of 
limitations had expired. Other students have written books about their experiences.

Following the claims, researchers at the University of South 
Florida in Tampa used ground-penetrating radar and soil samples and now believe there are many more bodies buried there than previously reported.

The largest gravesite is on the northside of the campus, where African-American boys were buried. It is at this site where the 31 graves are marked with white crosses, but researchers believe they do not correspond with actual burial sites.

'We anticipated finding about 25 to 30 
grave shafts,' said Christian Wells, an assistant professor of 
anthropology who led the anthropological work at the site. 'But in fact 
we found a minimum of 50.'

Institution: Dozier was opened as a state reform school in January 1900 for misbehaving boys

Treatment: The boys were allegedly forced into hard labour, while others were beaten, raped or killed

Culture: A memorial or burial service around 1950. More than 20 students' burials were undocumented

In 2009, writer Roger Dean Kiser published The White House Boys - An American Tragedy detailing the horrors he experienced while incarcerated at Dozier School for Boys.

He was sent to the reform school in 1959 when he was 12, and suffered brutal, bloody beatings in the infamous White House building.

'Little did I know that America had its own concentration camp for little boys right here in the good ole U.S. of A,' he wrote. 'A devil was hiding behind every tree, every building and even behind every blade of manicured grass.'

He writes on his website: 'The terrible screams I heard and the brutal beatings I witnessed as a 12 year old will remain in my memory forever.

'The beatings I suffered are not my horrors today. My horrors are the beatings of crying boys that I had to witness before my own beatings. The horror of knowing that I was next.

'The thick concrete walls and the loud 
industrial fan easily muffled the horrible screams of the boys as they 
were beaten bloody. Some were carried to the hospital in wheelbarrows 
and some had to have their underwear or pajamas surgically removed from 
the buttocks.

'For almost thirty minutes, at age sixty-two, I stood alone in the exact room where I was almost beaten to death. With my heart racing and the side of my neck pulsating, I lit a cigarette and I cried without feeling shame.'

Dozier's own records show that more than 
50 children were buried on the grounds, while more than 30 other bodies were sent 
elsewhere to be buried. But the school failed to record burial locations for 
22 other children who researchers learned died on the site, the Miami Herald reported.

Some of the children - and two adults - died in a fire and influenza outbreak in the early 1900s, while others were reported to have suffered from ill health or physical traumas.

In January, the researchers will return to the south of the campus, where the white children lived. They said they expect to find more graves here, with the boys also segregated in death.

African-American children at the school were three times more likely to be buried in an unspecified location than the white boys, the report found.

'I didn't realise going in how much of a story of civil rights it was,' Erin Kimmerle, an assistant professor of anthropology at the university, told reporters.

Seven boys are believed to have died following escape attempts, according to the report

Among
 the children who were overlooked was a white boy named Thomas Curry, 
who died of blunt head trauma. Records claimed he died away from the 
campus after he escaped.

The
 school records claim that boys who escaped happened to meet a violent 
death, including two who died of gunshot wounds to the chest or head.

Former
 students of the Dozier School, now aged 60 or older have told horror 
stories of how they were beaten as boys, in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.

Discovery: University of South Florida radar research shows burial sites do not correspond with the crosses

Ovell
 Smith Krell, now 83, said that her brother, Owen Smith, was sent to the
 Dozier School for Boys in the spring of 1940, after running away from 
home and later stealing and wrecking a car.

According to a 2009 letter written by
 Mrs Krell, the family never heard from Owen again. She said that her 
mother wrote to the school to inquire about her son’s whereabouts, but 
was told Owen escaped.

The school then said he was caught 
and captured by the sheriff’s department. When their father came to 
claim his son, he was told that he was sent back to Dozier.

It
 is unclear what then happened to Owen. Mrs Krell said that she talked 
to a former student who said that he saw Owen being taken into what was 
known as the White House, a place where boys were disciplined on campus.

Victims: Officials said the body of Owen Smith, left, was found decomposing under a house after he ran away. Thomas Varnadoe, far right, died of pneumonia 34 days after his arrival - yet his family said he was healthy

School grounds: Scientists believe there are bodies buried in wooded areas and unmarked graves

Ongoing: Researchers will look at a different area in January, where the white boys were buried

She
 wrote: ‘When they brought him out, they were carrying him. The boy said
 they heard his screams and that he was taken to the infirmary.’

Mrs Krell’s mother continued to write
 to the detention centre for months, until the school finally said that 
Owen’s badly decomposed body had been found under a house.

The school said that he had most likely died of pneumonia and was under the house to try to keep warm. However, the doctor and lawyer living in the house told Mrs Krell that they never heard or smelled anything.

Mrs
 Krell told CNN that she hopes to give her brother the burial he 
deserves. 'I would take him and put him down with my mom and dad in 
their cemetery,' she explained. 'I hope I get the chance.'
