Lewis Hamilton heads to Japan at the top of the drivers' championship after back-to-back victories at Monza and Singapore.

The Mercedes driver now holds a three-point lead over team-mate and title rival Nico Rosberg as he looks to take his maiden win at Suzuka.

With questionable reliability and a fraught relationship between them, the Japanese Grand Prix could provide further twists in an already memorable championship scrap between the pair.

Suzuka is one of only four tracks on this year's calendar where championship leader Hamilton has never won. He was victorious in Fuji back in 2007 but victory here eludes him as it does in Austria and Brazil - with the new race in Russia making up the quartet.

McLaren are the most successful manufacturer at the Japanese Grand Prix with Jenson Button's victory in 2011 the team's ninth win. Ferrari are second, two wins adrift of the Woking team.

Michael Schumacher is the most successful driver in the event's history. The German claimed his six wins in 1995, 1997, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2004.

Michael Schumacher won in Japan six times, making the German the race's  most successful driver

In eight of the last 12 races at Suzuka, the man on pole has taken the chequered flag.

Hamilton currently has eight victories to his name whilst driving for Mercedes and a ninth would see him take the record for wins with the German marque away from Juan-Manuel Fangio - who he sits level with for the time being.

Max Verstappen, 17, will become the youngest driver to ever participate in a grand prix weekend when he takes the wheel of a Toro Rosso in Friday's first practice session.

Reigning champion Vettel has won four of the last five races in Japan and the Red Bull driver heads to Suzuka on the back of his best performance of 2014 so far - a second-place finish in Singapore.

Sebastian Vettel has won four of the past five races at Suzuka but is well behind the leaders this season

Last year's event was the first since Suzuka replaced Fuji as host in 2009 that a safety car has not been required during the race.

Caterham's Kamui Kobayashi will be the only native driver on show - the 28-year-old finished third on his last showing in Suzuka back in 2012 with Sauber, his only F1 podium to date.

Including the 1995 Pacific Grand Prix in Aida, the world championship has been decided in Japan on 13 occasions - more than any other country.
