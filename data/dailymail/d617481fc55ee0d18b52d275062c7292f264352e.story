As House Republicans push a bill this week that funds the Department of Homeland Security while blocking President Barack Obama's dramatic immigration policy shifts, Speaker John Boehner said Tuesday that the White House should start listening to Americans' concerns about 'amnesty' run amok.

And in a testy meeting at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, he had a chance to press his case. 

Boehner told reporters that during a late-morning meeting with Obama he would 'make it clear to the president that we're listening to the American people. ... We hope he'll start to listen too.'

GOP messaging has become more animated and insistent in the week since they took over both houses of Congress. The speaker cast his party as constitutional defenders on Tuesday and insisted that the White House is playing games.

House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio told reporters on Tuesday that President Obama's 'overreach' on immigration had prompted his caucus to play hardball

'Our goal here is to fund the Department of Homeland Security. Our second goal is to stop the president's executive overreach,' he said. 'This is not the way our government was intended to work.

'The president said 22 times that he didn't have the authority to do what he eventually did. He knows the truth here! And so do the American people.'

A post-meeting 'readout' report from the speaker's office said Boehner 'reminded the president that he himself had stated publicly many times in the past that he did not have the power to rewrite immigration law through executive action.'

The House bill funding DHS past its current February 27 budget expiration is expected to pass by Wednesday, when GOP House members leave Washington for a two-day policy retreat in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

'We're voting to block the president's overreach – his executive overreach, which I believe is beyond his constitutional duty and frankly violates the Constitution itself,' Boehner said Tuesday.

'This is not about actually the issue of immigration. What it is is, it's about – the president acting lawlessly.'

Obama announced on Nov. 20 that he plans to mainstream 5 million or more illegal immigrants by giving them residency cards and work permits.

Congressional Democrats say leaving Homeland Security's budget up in the air while the status of those millions is debated risks sending the world the wrong message.

They cite last week's deadly terror attacks in France as Exhibit A.

Maryland Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer, the Democrats' second-in-command, said Tuesday on MSNBC that there is virtually unanimous bipartisan support for funding the agency but Republican leaders are standing in the way.

Conservatives in Boehner's caucus, he claimed, 'want to have confrontation' on immigration and other issues.

But Republicans say it's Obama who wants to see a clash of two of the three branches of America's divided government.

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California bashed the president for issuing 'five veto threats on bipartisan bills' in the week since Congress came back into session.

Democrats came away from November's bruising midterm election speaking optimistically about working with Republicans on tax reform.

At the beginning of his meeting with Capitol Hill leaders, Obama 'said he'd be looking for areas of bipartisan agreement and that the key was to work as a team,' according to a White House press pool report, which added that the president 'cited cybersecurity, trade, taxes, and "streamlining government".' 

But so far January has been consumed by partisan rancor focusing on the Keystone XL pipeline, the immigration battle and other areas where neither party has shown any flexibility.
