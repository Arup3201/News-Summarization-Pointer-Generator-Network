The 12-year-old attacked by a bear while she was out jogging in the woods said today she thought she was a 'goner' and that she would be mauled to death.

Abby Wetherell, from Michigan, miraculously survived the bear attack by playing dead but sustained deep gashes and puncture wounds to her thighs and back.

She was on her way home on Thursday around 9pm after a jog on her grandfather's wooded property in northern Michigan when she spotted the black bear chasing her.

The animal knocked the girl down twice and lashed one of her thighs with its powerful paws as she screamed for help.

Speaking to Good Morning America today she said: 'I see this bear. Oh, my gosh. I start running the way I was coming 
from. All of a sudden, the bear stopped me and put me down 
on ground, scraping me and clawing me.

'I was terrified. I was thinking, "I shouldn't have went for this jog. This is it, I'm a goner'."

The bear suddenly stopped attacking 
her and she took the chance to get up and run away but the bear came 
back. She decided to pet it to see if she could get the animal to like 
her.

'That did not work. Then it just got me again.

'And then I heard that you should 
play dead. So that's what I did,' she told GMA. 'And then it kind of 
went away and then it looked back and 
then it just took off.'

Her father Chris told GMA: 'I was in 
shock when I first saw her. I didn't believe it was a bear attack until I
saw the claw marks and bruises. It was horrible.'

Abby was taken to hospital and had to get 100 stitches on her wounds over two hours of surgery. She is recovering at home.

She said of her injuries: 'When the bear was attacking me, I couldn't feel it. I was 
just numb. I don't know how or why but my whole body went numb and when I
started getting up it hurt bad.

'It's over. But, I'm not going to go in the woods without anybody. I'm OK and I'll be all right.'

The Michigan Department of Natural 
Resources (DNS) set traps in the area of the attack in Wexford County's 
Haring Township, just north of Cadillac, and asked the public to be on 
the lookout.

The county has a well-established bear population but the animals generally avoid humans, DNR wildlife biologist Adam Bump said.

The
agency gets occasional reports of females challenging people who get 
too close to their cubs, he said. But in those cases, the sow usually 
snaps at the person once or twice and leaves.

The bear that went after Abby apparently was not protecting cubs, which made the attack highly unusual.

If the animal is caught, it will be euthanized and tested for rabies or other diseases, DNR spokesman Ed Golder said.

Father Chris Wetherell said: 'I was in shock when I first saw her. I didn't believe it was a bear attack until I saw the claw marks and bruises. It was horrible'

Despite the fright, the spunky girl, who is a hunter, said she was planning to return to the site where she was attacked and was more concerned about missing a soccer game this weekend, her grandfather David Wetherell said, the Detroit Free Press reported.

‘She didn't want to let the team down,’ he said of Abby, who is a goalie on a traveling soccer team.Michigan's black bear population is estimated at 8,000 to 10,000 but about 90 per cent are in the Upper Peninsula, the DNR said.

Wexford County is in the northwestern Lower Peninsula. Bears have been ranging farther south in recent years as growth of forested areas has provided more habitat and travel corridors, Bump said.

People who venture into likely bear territory should carry pepper spray, travel in small groups and make noise to avoid startling them, the DNR said.

‘If you encounter a bear, stand your ground and then slowly back away,’ the agency said in a news release. ‘Do not turn away.’

It advised people not to show fear, run or play dead, but instead to make themselves look as big as possible and talk to the animal in a stern voice.
