The parents of a young boy who was mauled by a pit bull are furious with the dog's owners.

Chase Loney, 3, of Prior Lake, Minnesota, was with his parents last August when he was attacked in his neighbors' living room.

He required 22 stitches, and an agreement was worked out that the neighbors would pay for medical costs and get rid of the dog, and no legal action would be taken.

That, however, is not what has happened.

Fox 9 reports that while the Loneys did get money from their neighbors, the dog is still there - and not going anywhere.

'We gave our neighbors the option to pay the medical bills and get rid of the dog, and we'll leave it alone,' said Chase's mom, Chandra Loney. 

'And they chose to keep the dog.'

Now, she is concerned the dog might attack other children in the neighborhood. 

Chase required 22 stitches after he was attacked, an incident his father says was unprovoked 

Chase still has scarring from the attack, and the neighbors now say they won't get rid of the dog

What's more, Chase's father, Chris Loney, said the attack was completely unprovoked.

'The dog just came out of nowhere,' he said.

The owners of the dog meanwhile feel they are being bullied, and say that there have been no problems with the animal since this incident in August, and that they have built a fence so the dog cannot get out.

They also said they have no plans to give up the dog.

As a result, the Loneys say they may now file a lawsuit.
