A police officer allegedly assaulted a motorist accused of hitting his mother's vehicle by hurling him face-down onto the concrete nearby.

Officer David Estele Jones III, 37, was charged with assaulting Richard Samuel McVicker, 38, near Charlotte, North Carolina, last Wednesday.

McVicker himself was charged with driving while impaired (DWI) after hitting Officer Jones’s 63-year-old mother in a low-speed collision.

Ouch: Richard Samuel McVicker, 38, was allegedly assaulted near Charlotte, North Carolina, after driving into the back of a police officer's mother's car

Officer Jones’s mother had stopped at a red light in Matthews when McVicker's vehicle hit its rear end at a low speed, with no injuries caused.

Police say the woman called her son and he then got into a fight with McVicker, who admitted he had drunk ‘a couple’ of beers beforehand.

He then got out of his car to ask if she was alright - but she allegedly took his driving licence, pulled up her window and would not speak.

‘Her first words were, “Give me your licence”. Her second words were: “My son's a cop”,’ McVicker told the Charlotte Observer.

McVicker began knocking on her window and she called her son, who arrived and allegedly left him with two black eyes and a cut on his nose.

‘He just hurled me face-down on the concrete and handcuffed me in the mud while I'm bleeding all over the place,’ he told the Charlotte Observer.

Jones has been a Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer for 11 years and has been suspended three times in the past for unspecified reasons.

His lawyer George Laughrun said Jones - who is now on paid leave - was rushing to aid his mother, who had called him for help.

Jones mother got McVicker’s keys to stop him leaving the scene and McVicker fell when pushed away from the car, Mr Laughrun said.

Now McVicker is considering suing Jones, who has not yet commented on the incident, reported the Charlotte Observer.
