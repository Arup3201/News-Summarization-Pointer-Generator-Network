Rallying residents have fought off controversial plans to build a gypsy site in the heart of an exclusive town which is home to a string of Premier League footballers and soap stars.

Nearly 700 locals from Wilmslow, Cheshire - whose homeowners include Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, United captain Nemanja Vidic, winger Nani and Corrie stars Bill Roache and Simon Gregson - made objections to the plans.

A series of public meetings was held and Cheshire East Council and townsfolk successfully argued that the application was far too vague and totally unsuitable for the area, a green belt site.

Nearly 700 objections were received against the planned traveller camp in Wilmslow, Cheshire (above)

Many feared hundreds of travellers would flock there in scenes reminiscent of the site at Dale Farm, Essex, which snowballed and became the largest traveller concentration in the UK.

The group was finally evicted last year after a  ten-year legal battle which cost an estimated £18million.

The
application for the Wilmslow camp was submitted by Green Planning Solutions, 
which is run by former MP Matthew Green - known as the ‘Gypsy King’
for his work in getting planning permission on green belt sites.

The proposal stated 'the stationing of caravans for residential purposes for 1 no. gypsy pitches together with the formation of additional hard standing and utility/dayrooms ancillary to that use'.

But the submitted plans for the 0.46 
hectare site were criticised for being unclear and many residents feared
that many more caravans would occupy the site.

Cheshire East councillor Gary Barton 
told a meeting which was attended by about 100 residents that 
‘inappropriate development is harmful to the green belt and should not 
be approved, except in very special circumstances.

'Travellers' sites, temporary or permanent, in the green belt are inappropriate development’.

Resident
Dennis O’Brien said: ‘The general shortage of dwelling properties and 
current house prices is an ongoing problem to get our adult children 
buying into their own home locally’.

‘I
therefore object strongly to this proposed application and can only 
foresee turmoil for years to come in an established residential area.’

John
Woodhouse said: ‘The lessons of Dale Farm should be learned. Can 
Cheshire East Council afford the millions of pounds that cost? As a 
local taxpayer I do not want the council to take that chance.’

The result of Dale Farm was a violent, decade-long saga that cost an estimated £18m and required a strong police presence

During the eviction of Dale Farm, protesters such as Minty Challis (pictured) set fire to tyres and wood as barricades

Meanwhile, Chris Lomas said: 'The area surrounding this application is a quiet, established community with low crime rate which attracts visitors to use the adjoining countryside for walking, horse riding, exercising their pets, or where children play.

'Others visit to patronise local businesses or even to view the location of where the Lindow man was discovered.

'I believe that allowing the continuation of this application would have all the above negative effects on the area.

'This objection is based on over 30 years' personal experience as a serving police officer and having witnessed time and time again the effects on the community, environment and high rise in crime levels.'
