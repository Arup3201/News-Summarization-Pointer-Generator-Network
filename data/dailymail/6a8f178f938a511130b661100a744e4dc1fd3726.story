A Chinese man who was convinced his wife was having an affair, ended the imagined love-triangle by stabbing his innocent ‘rival’ to death in the street.

Qin Han, 39, believed his wife Du, 33, was sleeping with a colleague and went to her workplace to confront her.

After spotting Du with the man he believed was her lover as they left the building, he attacked him with a knife, leaving him in a pool of blood.

According to neighbours, Mr and Mrs Qin had been arguing for months over his suspicions that she was cheating on him.

And after a particularly violent row at their home in the city of Xinxiang in central China’s Henan province, the father-of-two had decided to go to her work to ‘find proof’.

When he saw the man, known only as Mr Zhao, leaving the building with his wife, Mr Qin confronted the pair of them in the street and a heated row followed, local news reports.

He refused to accept Mr Zhao's insistence that he was certainly not having an affair with his wife, and his denials only enraged Mr Qin.

Fatal passion: Mr Zhao is seen being cared for by paramedics, but sadly did no survive the attack

When he turned to walk away, Mr Qin pulled out a knife and launched a furious attack on Mr Zhao, stabbing him repeatedly and leaving the man on the street.

Although police were called when they arrived the man was already dead, lying in a pool of blood, and a blood-stained Mr Qin was sitting on the floor in front of his tearful wife.

‘The man was just sitting there, not making any attempt to escape when the police arrived,’ and eyewitness said.

‘His wife was hysterical, she was shouting at him and saying "What am I supposed to do now?”

‘He seemed in contrast really quiet. He said: “Take care of our kids, this is not on you”’
