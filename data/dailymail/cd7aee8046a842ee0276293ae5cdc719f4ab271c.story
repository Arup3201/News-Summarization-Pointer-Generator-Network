Prince Charles ‘consorted’ with ministers to push his agenda on climate change, alternative medicine and grammar schools, politicians have admitted.

The revelations show for the first time that Charles is not only listened to at the highest levels of government – his views can sometimes influence policy.

Former Labour environment minister Michael Meacher said he worked behind the scenes with the Prince of Wales in a bid to persuade Tony Blair to ‘change course’ on green matters and to block genetically-modified crops.

Prince Charles 'consorted' with ministers to push his agenda on climate change, alternative medicine and grammar schools, politicians have admitted

Charles prompted Peter Hain, another former Cabinet minister, to promote the provision of complementary medicine on the NHS.

And he tried – but failed – to persuade then Education Secretary David Blunkett of the merits of grammar schools.

Last night, critics said that as heir to the throne, the prince should not be ‘lobbying’ for his pet projects and should start displaying the sort of neutrality he will need when he takes over as head of state. Pointing out that the Queen never makes her views known on controversial issues, one MP said that Charles as king could spark a ‘constitutional crisis’.

The prince is known for his strident opinions on a range of public policy areas.

Earlier this year, he caused a diplomatic spat with Russia by comparing president Vladimir  Putin to Hitler.

The revelations are particularly important as Charles is taking on a greater constitutional role even though he is not yet king.

He presided over the last Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Sri Lanka and has sat beside his mother for the last two years as she delivered the Queen’s Speech.

The interviews with politicians were conducted for Radio 4 documentary The Royal Activist.

Mr Meacher told the BBC that he and Charles had worked together to persuade Mr Blair to push green energy and  block GM crops. ‘We would consort together quietly in order to try and ensure that we increased our influence within government,’ he said.

‘There were always tensions within government. And I knew that he largely agreed with me and he knew that I largely agreed with him.’

Mr Meacher, who was Environment Secretary from 1997 to 2003, added: ‘I know he spoke to Tony Blair, obviously he would regularly speak to the Prime Minister, and I’m sure he told him his views, so we were together in trying to persuade Tony Blair to change course.’

He said it was possible that there was a constitutional problem in that a member of the Royal Family was advocating a political opinion.

‘Over GM I suppose you could well say that. Maybe he was pushing it a bit. I was delighted, of course.’

Mr Hain said the prince was pleased to find a minister who agreed with him on alternative medicine.

‘We found we shared a common view that complementary medicine should be introduced into the National Health Service, not as an alternative to conventional medicine but as a complement,’ he said.

‘He had been constantly frustrated at his inability to persuade any health ministers anywhere that that was a good idea.’

As Northern Ireland Secretary from 2005 to 2007, Mr Hain had influence over health policy before the devolution process was completed.

‘I was able to introduce a trial for complementary medicine on the NHS, and it had spectacularly good results, that people’s well-being and health was vastly improved,’ he said.

Peter Hain said Charles had been constantly frustrated at his
 inability to persuade any health ministers that complementary
 medicine was a good idea. And John Major said the prince would often write to him

‘When he learnt about this he was really enthusiastic and tried to persuade the Welsh government to do the same thing and the Government in Whitehall to do the same thing for England but  not successfully.’

Charles also had less success with Mr Blunkett over grammar schools. ‘I would explain that our policy was not to expand grammar schools, and he didn’t like that,’ said the former Education Secretary, who held the post from 1997 to 2001.

‘He was very keen that we should go back to a different era where youngsters had what he would have seen as the opportunity to escape from their background, whereas I wanted to change their background.’

Ministers have long complained about Charles bombarding them with so-called ‘black spider’ handwritten memos, in which he expounded his views on his pet projects.

The Attorney General has blocked the release of the letters, saying that to do so would be ‘seriously damaging to his role as future monarch’.

Last year the Mail revealed the prince had enjoyed dozens of meetings with cabinet ministers since the election – including two with the present Education Secretary Michael Gove and one with Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey.

Paul Flynn, a Labour member of the public administration select committee, said: ‘There is a really serious risk of constitutional crisis and a flare-up between crown and state when Charles becomes king.

‘Charles has strong opinions on a lot of things, including eccentric and barmy anti-science views on homeopathy and GM foods. If there is a clash, he may have such strong views as to refuse a bill.‘He is not only the next head of state; he is acting as a powerful and influential lobbyist.’

Anti-monarchy pressure group Republic said the former ministers’ comments proved that Charles had a political agenda which was ‘at odds with a lot of voters’.

Chief executive Graham Smith said: ‘Charles is engaging in an orchestrated and concerted effort to influence government behind closed doors and beyond public scrutiny. He wants the power but doesn’t want the public to know what he’s up to.

‘He is wading into some very controversial issues such as grammar schools, GM crops and alternative medicine. The public has a right to know whether his agenda is having an influence on government decisions.

And he tried - but failed - to persuade then Education Secretary David Blunkett of the merits of grammar schools

‘The Government needs to come clean, reveal the extent of royal influence and the nature of Charles’s lobbying of ministers. Without that transparency our democracy is under threat.’

Former prime minister Sir John Major defended Charles, saying: ‘I think it is encouraging that the Prince of Wales is entirely free from his unique perspective to write to ministers or the prime minister in a way that is invariably intended to be helpful.’

Sir John also revealed that he had changed policy as a result of his weekly meetings with the Queen. ‘I can recall occasions where the Queen, in discussion, put a gloss upon something that made one think and reflect upon whether it was being done in the right fashion at the right time,’ he said.

Clarence House said that Charles seeks to help people and communities here and abroad in whatever way he can.

A spokesman refused to  ‘comment on private conversations’.

MICHAEL MEACHER Environment minister,  1997 to 2003: 

‘We would consort together quietly in order to try and ensure that we increased our influence within government… And I knew that he largely agreed with me and he knew that I largely agreed with him.

‘Climate change is obviously the big one, the really, really big one. The other quite big one is GM, genetic modification. 

‘Maybe he was pushing it a bit. I was delighted, of course.’ 

PETER HAIN Northern Ireland  Secretary, 2005 to 2007 

‘He had been constantly frustrated at his inability to persuade any health ministers anywhere that [complementary medicine] was a good idea, and so he, as he once described it to me, found me unique from this point of view, in being somebody that actually agreed with him on this, and might want to deliver it.

I was able to introduce a trial for complementary medicine on the NHS (in Northern Ireland), and it had spectacularly good results, that people’s well-being and health was vastly improved. 

‘And when he learnt about this he was really enthusiastic and tried to persuade the Welsh government to do the same thing and the Government in Whitehall to do the same thing for England, but not successfully.’ 

DAVID BLUNKETT Education Secretary,  1997 to 2001 

‘I would explain that our policy was not to expand grammar schools, and he didn’t like that. 

‘He was very keen that we should go back to a different era where youngsters had what he would have seen as the opportunity to escape from their background, whereas I wanted to change their background.’ 

SIR JOHN MAJORPrime Minister 1990 to 1997

‘I think it is encouraging that the Prince of Wales is entirely free from his unique perspective to write to ministers or the prime minister in a way that is invariably intended to be helpful, and I think to cut that off, or to make sure those letters are much more bland than they otherwise might be, would be a loss.’ 

Sir John also revealed that he changed policy as a result of discussions with the Queen. 

He told the programme: ‘I think every prime minister can think that, and can think of occasions where that happened, I’ve no intention of indicating what they are.

But the answer is yes of course. It would be very foolish indeed not to be influenced. 

‘I can recall occasions where the Queen in discussion put a gloss upon something that made one think and reflect upon whether it was being done in the right fashion at the right time.’
