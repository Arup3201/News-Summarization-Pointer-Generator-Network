Is this the best bathtub in Berlin?

Soaking in both the bubbles and the views through floor to ceiling glass from 118metres above ground level, there's really no need to ever leave the tub, if you don't mind a little pruning skin.

I may not have been a guest in the Presidential Suite during my stay at the Waldorf Astoria, but I did climb into the en suite bathtub fully clothed during a clandestine sneak peek, just to see how the other half bathe, and yes, I feel I would be right at home here.

Soak in the views: The Presidential Suite en suite bathtub has panoramic views of the city from its floor-to-ceiling windows

Wake up in the sky: The palatial 260-square metre suite enjoys panoramic views from all walls

With two palatial bathrooms off of two enormous bedrooms adjoined by a chic lounge and dining room complete with grand piano and floor-to-ceiling windows with spectacular views throughout, it is little surprise that the suite enjoys an impressive occupancy rate - despite a nightly charge of £4,160. 

Down in the elevator a few floors is where my King Tower Suite is located. 

The suites manage to be contemporary and practical, sleek and elegant, and plush with designer touches to please every guest from business travellers to discerning holiday makers.

Features include a full size lounge with adjoining kitchenette, marble bathroom with a walk-in shower room and TVs hidden in the mirrors, and a pillow menu that includes non-allergenic, feather, wedge shape, cherry stone and horse hair... but what really wowed me about the suite was the views.

Room for a few: The other en suite is just as jaw-dropping, with a glittering bath and adjacent balcony

Elegance: The features every luxury including a grand piano, fire place and separate kitchenette

The Tower Suites occupy the upper floors of the landmark Waldorf Astoria skyscraper, rising 32 floors above the city, its tower of windows glittering in the sunlight.

This wall of uninterrupted glass translates to floor-to-ceiling windows in the suites, offering panoramic 180 degree views from north-west to south-east in my corner room.

I overlook Tiergarten, a field of green trees stretching away into the distance, speckled with red and brown as Autumn spreads. The zoo is immediately below, and I am treated to views of the monkeys, giraffe and elephant waking up with my morning coffee.

Luxury: Rooms in the 118 metre tower boast panoramic 180 degree views

Iconic: Vistas across the Tiergarten and Berlin Zoo to the landmark Fernsehturm TV tower

Decadent: The Lang Bar harks back to a more glamorous era - order the Tea N'T, you won't regret it

From one wall of windows I overlook Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in its Romanesque Revival splendour. To the north-east, I can see the iconic Fernsehturm TV tower in the distance. The only drawback to the panoramic vista is the eyesore Bayer building to the with its revolving logo which deserves a rusty nail.

The Tower Suites have their own separate entrance and lifts, which emerge just outside the famed Peacock Alley - a distinctive feature of all Waldorf Astoria properties that originated from the connecting corridor between the original adjacent Waldorf and Astoria hotels in New York when they were joined together by the formerly feuding Astor family members who owned them, William Waldorf Astor and John Jacob Astor IV. 

With its long and illustrious history dating back to 1893, the Waldorf Astoria has come to be synonymous with luxury and elegance, as well as superior service.

The New York hotel was the first in the world with electricity, and introduced room service to the industry. 

Waldorf Astoria Berlin, the latest in the hotel chain, succeeds in continuing the tradition following its completion in 2012 for 500million euros.  

At Waldorf, it is all in the finer details - ones you may not notice, but can certainly feel. A staircase railing features a design that, if flattened out, would showcase Beethoven's 5th Symphony. 

The Lang Bar harks back to a more glamorous era, with a long bar and Pullman-style booths. Try the Tea N'T, made with Earl Grey Tanqueray Ten Gin, orange flower water and tonic water - it is on another level, and made a convert out of this former gin-hater. 

Landmark: The skyscraping Waldorf Astoria stands out with its impressive tower of windows

Service in Les Solistes by Pierre Gagnaire is a carefully orchestrated performance, as the renowned chef's food is a work of art on the plate. It is plain to see why the Michelin-starred Gagnaire is nicknamed 'the Picasso of French cuisine.'

The service throughout the hotel is wonderful, the suites are sublime and the views unparalleled.

But what I'm really here for is the 'taste' of Waldorf. While most are aware that the Waldorf salad was created at the brand's New York flagship (the name gives it away) few know that it is just one of its iconic contributions to the culinary world.

TASTE OF WALDORF 

Eggs Benedict, Thousand Island Dressing and even Red Velvet Cake are all said to have been invented by Waldorf chefs. Keen to continue this proud tradition, Waldorf Astoria have announced the Taste of Waldorf in in partnership with James Beard Foundation.

Five renowned Waldorf chefs are teaming up with five rising star chefs at their hotels in Rome, Berlin, Edinburgh, Shanghai, and La Quinta, California.

Michelin man: Waldorf's renowned chef Pierre Gagnaire (his Les Solistes restaurant in the hotel pictured) is taking part in Taste of Waldorf 

Gagnaire, the masterful Michelin-starred chef behind London's Sketch and his eponymous restaurant in Paris, was in residence at The Waldorf last month to cook up Berlin's contribution alongside Hawaiian up-and-comer Christopher Kajioka.

Partnerships in Rome and Edinburgh have also taken place, with La Quinta and Shanghai to be completed by the end of the month. 

The winning dish will be decided by a panel of culinary influencers and judges at an event in February 2015 at Waldorf Astoria New York.

Nightly rates at Waldorf Astoria Berlin start from 238 Euros including breakfast.
