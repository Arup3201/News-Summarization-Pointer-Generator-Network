The horse meat scandal has escalated after it emerged that Asda and the Co-op have been selling contaminated beef burgers.

Four out of 17 burgers tested by the Co-op showed up positive for equine DNA, while one was as much as 17.7per cent horse meat.

Similarly, four frozen burgers made for Asda were positive for trace levels of horse DNA.

The news represents a major escalation of the food adulteration scandal, which has called into question whether supermarkets have any idea what goes in to their products.

Concerns about illegal horse meat contamination of burgers first emerged two weeks ago when Tesco and Iceland were named as selling tainted burgers in the UK.

Separately, these stores, together with Aldi and Lidl, were doing the same in their supermarkets in Ireland.

Evidence emerged today that it is likely that tens of millions of burgers containing horse meat have been sold to British families since May of last year.

The Co-op’s and Asda’s were manufactured by a company called Silvercrest, which is part of ABP Foods, based in County Monaghan in southern Ireland.

The same company was also responsible for making contaminated burgers for Tesco, where the meat content was up to 29per cent horse.

Silvercrest also made cheap burgers for Burger King, which, to date, insists there is no evidence that its products were contaminated.

One British company, Dalepak, which is also owned by ABP foods, produced burgers contaminated with horse DNA for Iceland from a factory in Yorkshire.

Dalepak also makes cheap burgers for Waitrose, which denies that any of its products are tainted.

The management of Silvercrest are being blamed for the contamination scandal after they decided to use a series of non-approved ingredients.

These included large and cheap consignments of frozen blocks of meat off-cuts, including horse, imported from Poland.

Up until today, both Asda and the Co-op denied any link to horse meat contamination, however they had withdrawn products made by Silvercrest as a precautionary measure.

Asda has attempted to play down the significance of the news, saying: ‘Four products, which were manufactured at the Silvercrest factory in Ireland have tested positive for very small trace elements of horse DNA, equivalent to a grain of salt in a bag of crisps, most likely as a result of cross contamination in the factory concerned.

‘We are continuing to investigate this… In the meantime none of the withdrawn products will be on our shelves and we will not be taking any further supplies from that factory.

‘Any customers that have concerns are welcome to bring the products back to store for a full refund.'

The Co-op said: ‘We pride ourselves on the quality of the products we sell, and we are taking this matter very seriously.

‘Whilst there are no safety issues involved, it is now apparent that some of the withdrawn products have not met the high standards we and our customers expect. We apologise for this.

‘We specify that all meat in our frozen burgers should be 100 per cent British, but we now strongly believe that some of the meat used to produce these burgers came from outside the UK and was not British in origin, and as a result we have taken the decision to delist Silvercrest as a supplier with immediate effect.’

Tesco today pointed the finger of blame at Silvercrest, saying it had no right to include imported meat off-cuts in its burgers. It said it had cancelled all contracts with the company.

Its technical director, Tim Smith, said: ‘The evidence tells us that our frozen burger supplier, Silvercrest, used meat in our products that did not come from the list of approved suppliers we gave them.

‘Consequently we have decided not to take products from that supplier in future. We took that decision with regret but the breach of trust is simply too great.’

The chief executive of Silvercrest’s parent company, ABP, Paul Finnerty, said: ‘We have learnt important lessons from this incident and we are determined to ensure that this never happens again.‘We have already implemented total management change at the Silvercrest facility – which remains closed.’

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has today said a mixture of beef and horse offcuts found in contaminated burgers sold in supermarkets could have been used for a year.

The contaminated meat was in the form of blocks of frozen product from the Polish supplier which had been used for a year, FSA chief executive Catherine Brown told the Commons Environment Committee.

Investigations are going on into how long contaminated meat might have been in use, Ms Brown told MPs.

Asked how UK consumers could know if horse meat had not been in burgers 'for months, if not years', Ms Brown replied: 'We haven't (in the past) identified horsemeat in burgers as a likely significant risk in this country, and therefore it is possible... and that's why I'm saying that it's very important now that we get to the bottom of the Polish connection and the Irish investigation because it is possible that these burgers have been on sale in this country.

'The probable limit of possibility... is a year because it's been a year that this supplier has been supplying.

'And therefore when the Polish get to the bottom of this we will hope to know whether it's likely that this has been going on for a year.'

Meat in Tesco burgers which was found to contain horse DNA did not come from a list of approved suppliers, the supermarket admitted today.

The meat also came from outside the UK or Ireland, which was contrary to the supermarket's policy.

The supermarket has vowed to introduce a DNA testing system on meat products to 'ensure the quality' of the food on its shelves in the wake of the scandal that has disgusted customers.

Tesco was forced to issue a public apology earlier this month after tests in Ireland discovered traces of horse meat in three frozen beefburger lines.

The findings sparked a national outcry and 10 million burgers were pulled from shelves as a result of the scandal.

The supermarket launched an investigation into how the meat ended up in stores in the UK and Ireland on January 16.

Today it promised to set a 'new standard' with the introduction of a testing system designed to detect 'any deviation from our high standards'.

It issued a statement saying: 'We made a commitment to customers to investigate thoroughly and share the findings with them. Since then, we have been working hard to understand what happened and how we can stop it ever happening again.'

It added: 'Ultimately Tesco is responsible for the food we sell, so it is not enough just to stop using the supplier.

'We have a well-equipped, expert technical team and world-class checks in place but we will not take anything for granted after this incident.

'It has shown that, in spite of our stringent tests, checks and controls there remained a small possibility that something could go wrong and it did. We want to stop it ever happening again, so we are taking action to reduce that possibility still further.

'To underpin the strong measures already in place, we will now introduce a comprehensive system of DNA testing across our meat products. This will identify any deviation from our high standards.

'These checks will set a new standard.

'It will be a significant investment for Tesco, borne by Tesco. We want to leave customers in no doubt that we will do whatever it takes to ensure the quality of their food and that the food they buy is exactly what the label says it is.'
