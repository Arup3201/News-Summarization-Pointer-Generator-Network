A controversial middle-school principal has apparently threatened to blow up his school cafeteria and kill all the teachers during an argument.

Neifi Juan Acosta, who is known for posting Bible verses on the walls of his New York City school, said he wanted to 'put on a vest like the terrorists do', according to several employees.

Officials are now investigating the 56-year-old after teachers filed a complaint over the bizarre rant.

Acosta allegedly made his remarks during a faculty meeting at Intermediate School 232 in the Bronx last November, in the wake of the destruction wreaked on New York by Hurricane Sandy, according to the Daily News.

The school has racked up a good academic and disciplinary record under the principal's leadership, but he has apparently alienated some staff with his mercurial ways.

During the tense post-disaster meeting, it seems that matters came to a head when Acosta attempted to chastise teachers by telling them they were 'putting themselves in God's seat'.

When one member of staff asked why he was angry, he said he had been upset by the behaviour of the faculty.

He allegedly continued: 'I know what I'll do - I'll call a conference in the cafeteria, and I'll put on a vest like the terrorists do and I'm going to blow you all up.'

Teachers reported Acosta to the police, the city's Department of Education and the local teaching union.

Although the NYPD concluded that the principal does not pose a terrorist threat, city officials have launched an investigation and are considering whether to censure him.

Members of staff who are being interviewed as part of the inquiry say they have been targeted by Acosta posting biblical quotations outside their classrooms.

The posters read: 'We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed but not driven to despair; persecuted but not forsaken,' concluding: 'We will never, ever surrender.'

The principal has refused to comment on the allegations against him.
