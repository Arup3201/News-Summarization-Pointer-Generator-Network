She's been in the showbiz industry for years, gracing hundreds of red carpets and fronting the glossiest of fashion and beauty campaigns but Gwyneth Paltrow claims she's 'terrible' at beautifying herself.

The mother-of-two, who always looks camera-ready, opened up about her hopeless beauty regime in her latest Goop post. 

'Believe it or not, I am terrible at doing my own make-up,' writes the actress. 'I'm decent at doing it for a friend, but when it comes to my own face, I never get it right.'

Going natural: Gwyneth Paltrow, pictured looking fresh-faced, has opened up about her beauty regime on her latest Goop post and is convinced that she's 'terrible' at doing her own make-up

The 41-year-old goes on to explain that she's been wanting a step-by-step lesson for ages so she asked her London make-up artist, Emma Lovell, to show her how. 

Sadly, camera-shy Gwynnie doesn't feature in the beauty tutorial. Instead, she asked one of her 'gorgeous school mum friends from my son Mosey's class' to be the model. 

Emma recreates the make-up she usually does for Gwyneth's daytime interviews and appearances and the star shares a step-by-step account to achieving the look at home. 

'Before you start to think about applying make-up, it's important to take good care of your skin by cleaning and moisturising,' says Gwyneth.

Before applying make-up, Emma always cleans the face and neck using a Clarisonic Blue Cleansing System and Nuxe Cleansing Water, she then spends a good few minutes blending in Nuxe's Créme Prodigeuse Day. 

'One of Emma's many tips is to moisturise the entire neck, including the back; this keeps the front nice and taut,' adds Gwyneth. 

All glammed up: Gwyneth, 41, always looks polished. Her secret? She says before you start to think about applying make-up, it's important to take good care of your skin by cleaning and moisturising - followed by 21 products 

Emma applies a few dabs of Jemma Kidd's Light As Air Foundation to the forehead, nose, cheeks, and chin and Jemma Kidd Wrinkle Rescue Serum and Brightener over the T-zone.

'Notice Emma puts the foundation on her hand first and uses her fingers to apply it and work it onto the skin. Always start from the centre and work outwards,' advises Gwyneth.

Next is the EF|Studio Precision Lash Curler. 'This is Emma's one "don't leave the house without it" must. Always, always curl your lashes. As Emma says, it wakes up your face,' she emphasises.

She also uses a creamy eyeshadow and dark brown mascara, which Gwyneth says is great for the daytime look.

Another essential in Gwyneth's make-up regime is filling in her eyebrows with a light pencil before brushing them with a clean mascara wand.

A creamy blusher, two hydrating lipsticks and a sweep of translucent powder make up the final touches. 

When Emma needs to transform Gwyneth's look from day to night, she usually only has 20 minutes to prepare, so she builds on the daytime make-up she'd already done.

She enhances the look by using liquid eyeliner and a black mascara. To make the lips look fuller, she uses lip liner, a lip palette and gloss. 

She then swept Jemma Kidd's Dual Illuminator Crème Highlighter & Shimmer Dust over the cheekbones and set it with a translucent powder.

'To really liven up the look, Emma dabs shimmery eye shadow on the centre of the eyelid. Emma says there's nothing worse than a dry-looking eye! This shimmer makes you look glistening,' adds Gwyneth. 

Twenty one products and twenty minutes later, Gwyneth concludes: 'I learned so much. I hope it's helpful for some of you!'
