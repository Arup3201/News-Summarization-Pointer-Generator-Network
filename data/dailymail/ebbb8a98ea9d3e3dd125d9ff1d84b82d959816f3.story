A teenager claims to have eavesdropped on a highly sensitive conversation between intelligence officers after ‘phone-bombing’ Scotland Yard’s anti-terrorism hotline.

Yesterday the leader of an anarchist group known as Team Poison posted live excerpts on YouTube of what appeared to be a briefing of counter-terrorism officers in which they discuss a property historically linked to the IRA among other operations.

A group known as Team Poison said they had ‘hacked’ Scotland Yard’s secure communication system by exploiting old technology dating back to the 1980s.

They also claimed responsibility for jamming the hotline by making more than 700 prank calls, boasting that it was ‘easy’ to drop ‘a 24-hour phone bomb’ on elite security officers.

But last night the Metropolitan Police insisted its systems had not been breached and said that any recording would have been made via the  receiving handset, raising the possibility that the group may have made the recording after an officer failed to replace the handset properly.

Detectives have now vowed to take ‘appropriate action’ after a number of recordings were posted on YouTube by the group.

Last night two teenagers, aged 16 and 17, were arrested at an address in the West Midlands on suspicion of offences under the Malicious Communications Act and the Computer Misuse Act.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said the pair were in custody in the West Midlands.

Denials: Ailsa Beaton, Director Of Information for the Metropolitan Police Service, dismissed claims that Scotland Yard systems had been breached

It had already been linked to alleged hacking attempts on Facebook and a personal email account connected to a former staff member of former prime minister Tony Blair.

In one of the clips, a male identifying himself as ‘Trick’  is heard telling an officer: ‘Knowledge is power... We embarrass governments and f*** the police.’

‘Trick’ is later heard laughing when a woman comes on the line to tell him the phone call was being passed on to the FBI.

The group claimed the calls were made to MI6, but they were in fact picked up by the Metropolitan Police’s counter-terrorism command.

‘Trick’, reportedly a 17-year-old who launched Team Poison in 2010, emailed the Press Association yesterday, claiming that the group bypassed outdated technology to  compromise a server from Malaysia to record conversations.

He said: ‘The phone denial of service was done via a custom script for Asterisk which was installed on an overseas server.

‘The conversation was tapped into via a private phreaking method, their phone system is old and we found a way to get in via basic but private phreaking technique.’

Twitter messages suggested a variety of motives for the attack on the Home Office, including government plans to boost digital surveillance  powers and Britain’s extradition treaty with the United States, which critics say is biased in Washington’s favour.    

The messages warned there would be further attacks on British government websites every Saturday.

But
last night Ailsa Beaton, Director Of Information for the Metropolitan 
Police Service, dismissed claims that Scotland Yard systems had been 
breached.

Miss Beaton, who is also the Association of Chief Police Officers’ lead for information management, said: ‘We have throughout the day researched the allegation that the Anti-Terrorist Hotline had been “hacked” and “activists’” claims that they were able to listen unrestricted to confidential communications.

‘We are confident the MPS communication systems have not been breached and remain, as they always have been, secure.

‘We are satisfied that any recording would have been made via the receiving handset only and not from an attack on internal systems.

‘The public can remain confident in the ability to communicate in confidence and that the integrity of the Anti-Terrorist Hotline remains in place.’
