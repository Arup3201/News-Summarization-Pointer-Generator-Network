The note which was left on the dash of the accident victim's car

A Sydney motorist who crashed into a parked car scrawled a note on the back of a fast food voucher offering it as compensation for the damage caused.

The unknown driver of a 'nice, black fancy car' apologised in the note for crashing into the parked vehicle in Sydney's inner-western suburb of Newtown on Sunday.

But they failed to do the right thing and include their contact details so they could contribute to the repair costs.

'I'm sorry I reversed into your car, I am Asian & can't drive here's a Hungry Jacks voucher!'' said the note.

Two witnesses to the Newtown crash said they didn't raise the alarm or take down registration details because they thought the culprit was doing the right thing when they placed the note on the car.

The contents of the note indicated the driver was being mischeivous, and possibly racist. Witnesses said the offending driver was not even Asian.

The furious owner took their rage to social media site Reddit where they left an image of the Hungry Jacks voucher - valued at $6.25 - and proof of the damage to the car they said would cost them at least $625.

'Some mysterious a-hole smashes into (name redacted) parked car in Newtown and leaves this charming, racist note and a $6.25 Hungry Jacks voucher,' Reddit user Ilyank posted.

'Needless to say they didn't bother to leave any identifying information. Excess on damages = $625.' 

The damage left to the car by the driver of the 'nice, black fancy car'

'Ilyank' said the witnesses of the alleged crash didn't write down the driver's number plate because they 'assumed they were doing the honourable (sic) thing.'

'Also, they said they were driving a nice,  fancy black car.'

The Reddit user hopes by telling her story someone will see what happened and make a stand.

'So, with that huge amount of info to go on, if you know who did this, be a dibber dobber.'

In instances such as this, Ilyank said that 'it's OK to turn in your mate.'

'Your friend is an a*****e (sic), friend code does not need to extent to a*****es.'

Comments condemning their actions have littered the user's Reddit site, with some venting their own anger over similar incidents.

One user, 'furgle' said:  'Luckily I have zero trust for the general driving public and have front and rear dash cams in my cars.'

'Guy left after waiting to see if anyone saw him. Took the video to the police and they had a laugh. He got done with hit & run, and my excess was $0.' 

Another said it was an unfortunate situation given the witnesses would have taken action to write down the perpetrators details, had they known better. 

'The sad thing is that the bystanders would have helped had they known they weren't writing down details. Just an all around a**hole.'
