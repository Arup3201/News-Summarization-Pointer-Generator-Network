Suso, who has not played for the Liverpool first team since their Capital One Cup penalty shoot-out win over Middlesbrough at Anfield on September 23, impressed during a 45-minute run-out as he eased his way back following a groin injury.

Bayern Munich forward and one time Liverpool target Xherdan Shaqiri has agreed to join Inter Milan on loan, however, the deal has yet to be ratified by Bayern and he will hold talks with club officials on Wednesday. 

The 23-year-old joined the Bundesliga giants in 2012 but has found his opportunities limited by the likes of Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery.
