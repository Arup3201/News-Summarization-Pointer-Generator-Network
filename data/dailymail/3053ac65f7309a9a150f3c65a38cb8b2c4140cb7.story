With Christmas holidays and the New Year edging ever closer, a packed social diary can often mean pressure to drink more than usual. 

During the festive season, it has become an accepted norm that people will drink excessively, whether it be as a celebratory mood enhancer, friendly peer pressure or as a means of coping with the additional pressures that Christmas time can bring. 

'People drink to have fun at Christmas, but often people are drinking to calm their nerves during social functions,' said hypotherapist Georgia Foster.

'That could be a work function or spending time with their judgemental Great Aunt Joan.'

The festive season can quickly turn 'festy' as people struggle with hangovers and poor health, because of some crucial errors they make when drinking.  

People drink to have fun at Christmas, but often endless parties, functions and family lunches means people can fall into unhealthy habits and drink to excess too frequently

A list has been devised of ten tips to help avoid over drinking at Christmas, to avoid hangovers, embarrassment and long-term damage

However, feeling nasty the next morning isn't the only reason why curbing your drinking is a wise decision. 

Extreme drinking, even once a year, can have catastrophic effects on long-term health and many people are completely unaware that the amount they drink is considered harmful .

One in five adults drink at levels that place them at risk of lifetime harm.

More than two in five adults drink at levels that put them at risk of an alcohol-related injury, according to a 2014 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report.

In fact, one-in-five drinkers aged 18 years and over in 2012-2013, drank at levels exceeding the 2009 guidelines for long-term and lifetime drinking risk management.

Although expert Georgia Foster says is perfectly acceptable to drink and be merry at Christmas time, she has devised a list of tips to help people minimise hangovers and embarrassment in December. 

She says it is important to be mindful of not only how much or how fast you are drinking, but also the reasons why you keep filling your glass.

Ms Foster says stopping altogether may not necessarily be the answer but learning to control your drinking this Christmas can increase a person's happiness.

Anybody who find themselves drinking to feel better need to drink to feel better is displaying a negative relationship with alcohol, according to Ms Foster.

1. Decide before you go out how much you are going to drink over the hours you are there and stick to it.

2. Put a message or photo on your phone to remind you of an embarrassing drunk memory.

When you are considering drinking more than you had planned, look at the image or message. 

You most likely will not reach for another drink!

3. Finish each drink before you have a top up so you can gauge how much you are drinking.

4. Opt out of all cocktails and punches. 

They can be lethal and hard to tell how much alcohol is in them.

5. Do not be coerced into drinking to please others. Tell little white lies if you need to.

Such as: Feign you are taking antibiotics or just a little under the weather. 

Even better, tell people you have a ‘cracking hangover’ and couldn’t fathom a drink!

6. DOWO Policy. Drink one, water one. Alternate between alcohol and water, to keep you hydrated.

7. Drink from your non-dominant hand. It will seem a little uncomfortable, so it will make you more aware of how much you are drinking.

8. Drink a big glass of water before you start drinking, to hydrate yourself. You will often drink alcoholic beverages too fast if you are thirsty.

9. If you are shy or bored, instead of reaching for the alcohol to calm you down or entertain you, shift your thinking to something funny and sing silently “baa baa black sheep” at the same time. 

This will distract your mind away from self doubt and shift your thinking into a positive state.

10. When feeling anxious, take one deep belly breath and count to five. Repeat that three times. When you breathe into that part of the body you make more endorphins. You physically change the chemical make up of your brain to feel happier.' 

Although it is perfectly acceptable to celebrate with drinks at Christmas, there are some crucial errors that people make which result in over-drinking

The solution may not simply be about ditching the drink altogether but rather re-establishing the relationship with alcohol, and learning how to enjoy it at a minimised intake.

'I specialise in why people drink,' said Ms Foster.

'I'm Australian and I get it! I'm not against drinking.'

'The top of drinking is often taboo when it shouldn't be because it's a part of our culture.'

Ms Foster says drinking for fun or for celebratory reasons is understandable, but often there are emotional reasons that dictate how we drink and how much we consume.  

'For a lot of people it's not their drinking but their thinking that is the real problem,' said Ms Foster.

Ms Foster says there are two important problems to address when it comes to a person's drinking habits: why they drink and how they drink. 

'There are emotional drivers that make people drink that they're unaware of,' she said.

People may feel the need to drink because of their insecurities, a problem which Ms Foster helps to correct through teaching mindfulness, self-awareness and positivity.

A person's negative thinking, known as their 'inner critic', comes from 'the negative part of their brain' called the Amygdala.

Neuroscientists have proven that alcohol affects the Amygdala, stopping these subconscious thoughts and helping the person to calm down.

Drink a big glass of water before you start drinking, to hydrate yourself. You will often drink alcoholic beverages too fast if you are thirsty. Also drink a glass of water between every alcoholic beverage

'If a person in the past has used alcohol as a mood enhancer or to silence these thoughts, it often becomes a learned behaviour,' said Ms Foster.

A lot of people are socially shy and use alcohol at those times to relax or feel more confident. 

'Christmas is a time that can trigger a person's vulnerability and drinking is a way to numb that,' said Ms Foster. 

'People often don't realise it when they're drinking to escape negativity.'

People frequently make basic mistakes when drinking, which results in drinking too quickly or consuming more than planned.

One hilarious, but understandably effective way to make sure you don't drink too much is by using photos on your phone.

Ms Foster recommends putting a message or photo on your phone to remind you of an embarrassing drunk memory.

 'When you are considering drinking more than you had planned, look at the image or message,' explains Ms Foster.

'You most likely will not reach for another drink!'

If a person is feeling uncomfortable, they should change how they feel instead of drinking to mask their emotions. 

A breath is often all it takes.

'When feeling anxious, take one deep belly breath and count to five. Repeat that three times,' said Ms Foster. 

'When you breathe into that part of the body you make more endorphins.

'You physically change the chemical make up of your brain to feel happier.' 

Positive thinking also prevents drinking to mask feelings of self-doubt or anxiety.

'If you're going into an environment that will make you feel vulnerable, imagine a time with a laugh or a time where you felt love and your brain will shift.

'You will feel positive and also learn that the positive memories are part of the social space and the drinking issue.'  

The benefits of drinking less during the Christmas period include less hangovers, reduced weight gain, increased energy and often increased confidence

She says the problem is when people become accustomed to alcohol and need to drink more to experience the same sensations. 

'As your body gets used to drinking, the one glass that used to make you relax doesn't have the same effect. 

'Your brain doesn't get the same fix so it asks for more.'

Christmas is a time to unwind and relax, but Ms Foster says the time will be even more enjoyable if people take care of themselves and find a way to drink for enjoyment.

'I think the great thing about not drinking to excess is that your self-esteem improves.

'Anxiety reduces and you become more confident and calm socially when you're not relying on alcohol to make you feel better.'

There are also a plenitude of physical benefits.

'You don’t put on as much weight, you eat better because you're not looking for the carbs the next day when you're hungover.

'Your relationship with yourself improves when you're not running away from yourself and your life,' says Ms Foster.

'Life is much more fun and interesting when you are confident so you only need a couple of drinks or no drinks.

'It's better when you feel like you don’t need to drink with that intensity.'
