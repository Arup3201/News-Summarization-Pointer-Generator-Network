A 16-year-old boy bypassed security and climbed to the top of 1 World Trade Center, the nation's tallest building, to take pictures in the middle of the night, police said Thursday.

Justin Casquejo, of nearby Weehakwen, New Jersey, was arrested at 6 a.m. Sunday and charged with misdemeanor criminal trespass, said Joe Pentangelo, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site.

The teen accessed the construction site of the nearly completed tower by slipping through a 1-foot opening in a fence at around 4.00 a.m., Pentangelo said. He then allegedly entered the tower by climbing scaffolding.

Fascinated: Casquejo has long been obsessed with the WTC's Freedom Tower, according to the Post

'He’s a skinny kid who got through a skinny hole,' a police source told the New York Post.

Casquejo is said to have taken an elevator up to the 88th floor despite not having any identification, according to the paper.

He was let off at the 88th floor and hoofed it up to the 104th floor where he sneaked past a sleeping guard to access the roof.

That guard has since been fired, the spokesman said, but the elevator operator was ab;e to keep his job because he is in a union.

Casquejo scaled equipment on the roof to reach the 1,776-foot tall Freedom Tower's antenna.

The daredevil spent two hours perched atop the city before trying to sneak his way out as the sun came up.

'He came here and he ran hog wild,' a site worker told the Post.

Boisterous: Casquejo was much more talkative on Twitter than when reached by the Post

Port Authority police arrested him on the premises. His camera and cellphone were seized after authorities obtained a search warrant.

Officials are still trying to piece together exactly how he was able to elude security measures implemented by agencies including the New York Police Department, Port Authority Police and private security firms.

'I walked around the construction site and figured out how to access the Freedom Tower rooftop,' Casquejo said in court, according to documents cited by the paper.

The investigation was continuing into whether the teen may have entered other parts of the building.

He later tweeted the word 'inspired,' in reference to his now-infamous climb to the top of one of the tallest buildings in the world.

He wasn't nearly as talkative when reached by the post.

'Ha ha, oh yeah, that. Right. I would really love to talk to you guys because I have a lot that I want to say about it,' said the teen. 'I was told that I just can’t [talk] without permission.'

'We take security and these types of infractions very seriously and will prosecute violators,' Joe Dunne, chief security officer for the Port Authority, said in a statement. 'We continue to reassess our security posture at the site and are constantly working to make this site as secure as possible.'
