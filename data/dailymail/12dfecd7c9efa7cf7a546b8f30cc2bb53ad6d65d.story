Rescue teams have intensified their search for a couple and four young children who are missing in sub-zero temperatures after heading to Nevada mountains to play in the snow on Sunday.

James
Glanton, 34, his girlfriend Christina McIntee, 25, and the four 
children, a 10-year-old, two four-year-olds and a three-year-old, headed
to Seven Troughs at noon but failed to return.

Two of the children belong to the missing adults,
and one is a niece and one is a nephew, according to the Pershing 
County sheriff's office. They were identified as Evan Glanton, Chloe 
Glanton, Shelby Fitzpatrick and Tate McIntee.

A rescue mission searching for the family and their 2005 Jeep was launched
shorty after 8pm Sunday and continued through the night. Authorities are hoping to resume an aerial search today.

Gone: The sixth member of the missing group is Evan Glanton. They have not been seen since Sunday

'It's
got to be brutal out there,' said Mark Turney, a spokesman for the U.S.
Bureau of Land Management. 'Let's hope they are found quick.'

The
temperature was expected to drop below zero again on Tuesday after 
plunging to minus-16 degrees on Monday in Lovelock, the rugged, 
snow-covered area where the group is believed to be, about 100 miles 
northeast of Reno.

It remains unclear what supplies the family might have been carrying.

The
family has not had any communication with others since they went 
missing, according to Sheila Reitz of the sheriff's office. The area has
spotty cell phone coverage, he said.

'I'm
hoping they all huddled together and stayed in the Jeep,' said Nevada 
Highway Patrol Trooper Chuck Allen. 'That would be a best-case 
scenario.'

Rough terrain: They are missing with four children, aged 10, four, four and three, authorities said

Hopes: Authorities said they hope Glanton, McIntee and the children have stayed together in the Jeep

Rural: The group was headed to Seven Troughs when they went missing

On Sunday, Navy 
search-and-rescue team and the Civil Air Patrol, an all-volunteer 
auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force, were assisting the sheriff's office by 
searching a concentrated area.

Two planes scoured the area on Monday and three could go out Tuesday if the group isn't found, Maj. Thomas Cooper said.

Several
inches of snow was on the ground in the area, but the black top on the 
silver Jeep should help make it easier to spot from the air, authorities
said.

While the cold made 
for dangerous conditions, the clear weather was working in the pilots' 
favor. The forecast called for mostly sunny again on Tuesday with clouds
moving in Tuesday night.

The cold 'is not a big issue,' Cooper said. 'We're concerned about stuff coming out of the sky.'

The
Seven Troughs area is named after a series of seven parallel canyons 
below Seven Trough Peak - elevation 7,474 feet - in the Kamma Mountains 
stretching north across the Pershing-Humboldt county line.

Where are they? They headed out in a silver Jeep with a black roof (pictured) but failed to return home

Biting: The area is covered in snow and suffering sub-zero temperatures, making the search urgent

It's
about 20 miles northwest of where Lovelock sits on Interstate 80 and 
about 20 miles southeast of the Black Rock Desert, where the annual 
Burning Man counterculture festival is held.

'It's
remote, and it's rocky,' Nevada Department of Wildlife spokesman Chris 
Healy said. 'There are good dirt roads into the place, but they are dirt
roads, and it is cold and snow so it's not ideal.'

Healy said Seven Troughs is a popular area for hunting chukars, a pheasant-sized winter game bird.

'So
it's not the kind of area where there would be nobody around,' he said 
Monday. 'But most chukar hunters are smart enough not to go out in the 
weather we have now.'

If you know anything or have seen the group, you are urged to call the Pershing County Sheriff's Office at 775-273-2641.
