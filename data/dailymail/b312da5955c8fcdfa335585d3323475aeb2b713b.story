A terminally-ill cancer patient has entered rehab to kick his secret addiction to painkillers so that he can die drug free.

John Eggers, a 48-year-old former attorney who was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor last year, admitted to KTLA that he had been struggling with the addiction after originally taking opiates for a sore back.

'I'm in an extremely dark place, a place where you can never imagine being,' he told the channel, which has documented his attempts to complete a bucket list as he battles the disease.

Coming clean: John Eggers, a former attorney with terminal cancer, has revealed he checked into rehab so he could kick an addiction to painkillers and die drug free - the latest item on his bucket list

He explained that the stress of the diagnosis had led him to rely on the pills.

'I realized that my life span is very 
short and that's okay, that's acceptable to me,' he said. 'What's not acceptable is
 wasting what time I do have on drugs and opiates.'

Eggers, from Irvine, California, checked into the Adelante Recovery Center and is now drug free, although he will be prescribed painkillers following his next procedure, KTLA reported.

It is just the latest aim he has ticked off his bucket list. He has also traveled to Europe, skydived, met his favorite teen band Depeche Mode and attended the Halloween party at the Playboy Mansion.

Other highlights have included attending holiday receptions as the guest of honor at Vice President Joe Biden's mansion and the White House, and an appearance on TV show Major Crimes.

Struggle: Eggers, who was diagnosed with the aggressive cancer last year, becomes emotional in hospital

He planned the impressive list when he was diagnosed with glioblastoma stage 4 in January 2013.

He had just returned home from the gym when he started losing feeling in his limbs and could not speak. He suffered a seizure and when he awoke hours later, he called 911, the OC Register reported.

Doctors discovered a massive tumor along the right side of his skull and he underwent brain surgery, leaving him with a large scar along the side of his head and his face partially paralyzed.

His doctors gave him just 12 to 15 months to live, so he decided to really begin living life, raising funds for other cancer sufferers and working pro bono for families who need help standing up to their health insurance companies on behalf of their sick children.

New life: Eggers, who is married, had his own law practice for 15 years before the diagnosis, left, but said until the diagnosis he thought of himself before others. He is pictured with his family, right

Before the diagnosis, 'I spent a lot of time thinking about 
myself and - I'm not proud to say this â€“ not much thinking about other 
people,' he said. 'Now, I want to leave this place better than I 
found it.'

He said that his latest feat - kicking the painkillers - will now truly allow him to live.

'Emotionally I'm in a much better place,' he said.
