Two men were shot and wounded and punches thrown as violence broke out at a pre-season NFL game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Oakland Raiders last night.

A 24-year-old man has life-threatening injuries after he was shot up to four times in the stomach in the parking lot of Candlestick Park in San Francisco for wearing a T-shirt with a derogatory comment about the 49ers.

Another man was hospitalised with superficial face injuries after he was shot in a separate incident outside the game. The 20-year-old is expected to survive.

The shootings occurred shortly after the 49ers' 17-3 victory, police said.

Inside the game, punches were thrown as a fist fight broke out in the stands.

In another incident, a man was left unconscious with life threatening injuries after a fight broke out in a washroom.

Officers said that the 24-year-old who was shot in the parking lot drove his truck to a gate and stumbled to security.

Police took a man in a Raiders jersey off a party bus before it left the stadium and are calling him a suspect.

The two shootings were believed to be 
connected, but it is not known if the fights inside the stadium had 
anything to do with them.

'We are treating it as separate shootings, but we believe they are related,' said a police spokesman who said all the suspects and victims attended the game.

The 49ers issued a statement acknowledging the shootings and the investigation, but offering no further details.

The violence was not the first involving a San Francisco sports team's game this year.

In March, San Francisco Giants fan Bryan Stow was severely beaten by two men in Los Angeles Dodgers gear outside Dodger Stadium after the teams' season opener.

He remains in San Francisco hospital with in serious condition with brain injuries. Two suspects have been charged in the case.
