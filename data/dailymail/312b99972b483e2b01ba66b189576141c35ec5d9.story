Cutting edge: Health Secretary Andrew Lansley will today unveil plans for a £150million proton beam therapy service on the NHS

Cancer patients will soon be able to receive revolutionary radiotherapy in England.

At present, those needing proton beam therapy are flown to the U.S. or Switzerland to receive it, at an average cost of £90,000 to the NHS.

But the Government announced yesterday that the treatment will soon be offered in London and Manchester, with the capacity to help 1,500 patients a year.

The therapy uses charged particles instead of X-rays to target tumours, and is particularly useful for certain cancers in children, who are at risk of lasting damage to organs that are still growing.

It can give a higher dose of radiotherapy that causes minimal damage to surrounding healthy tissue, and also causes fewer side-effects than X-rays.

Conventional treatment can lead to deafness, reduced IQ and secondary cancers.

Because it is more accurate, proton beam therapy can also treat tumours in hard-to-reach places – such as the base of the skull or the brain, eye or spine – with higher success rates.

Under a £250million programme funded by the Department of Health, proton beam therapy facilities will be built at The Christie NHS Foundation Trust hospital in Manchester and the University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

Less effective: Conventional radiotherapy causes far more side-effects because the radiation can damage surrounding tissue

The sites will not be fully up and 
running until 2017, and so the NHS will continue to fund treatment and 
travel costs for patients sent abroad in the meantime.

Almost
150 have been treated under this scheme so far, and by 2015 the NHS 
will be spending an estimated £30million a year to send up to 400 
patients overseas.

Flown to America: Lily Gillon

Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said 
that offering proton beam therapy was vital to ensure that cancer 
facilities in the NHS were world class.

‘In addition to improved success rates, proton beam therapy reduces the 
side-effects which patients, particularly children, can suffer as a 
result of traditional forms of cancer treatment,’ he said.

‘Once this 
service is in place, The Christie and UCLH will boast unparalleled 
cancer facilities.

‘It will mean more patients will be able to get this treatment, 
including those for whom travelling abroad for long periods is not 
possible.’

The British Institute of Radiology praised the Government’s commitment to the service ‘at such a financially challenging time’.

Dr Jane Barrett, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, agreed.

‘We are delighted to see that the Government has made this important 
commitment and that by 2017 there will be two treatment centres in 
England,’ she said.

‘This underlines the vital importance of modern radiotherapy in the 
treatment of cancer and will deliver improvements in treatment for 
patients that the RCR has long sought.’

When Lily Gillon was diagnosed with a brain tumour, conventional radiation treatment was deemed too dangerous.

The toddler’s age, and the threat to surrounding tissue, meant the only chance of saving her life was proton beam therapy.

Although it is offered at two centres in the U.S. and one in Switzerland, the treatment is currently unavailable in Britain.

The NHS does, however, pay for some patients to receive it abroad. It also picks up the tab for travel and accommodation.

Under this scheme, Lily’s mother Cherie, 26, took her to Oklahoma last year, where she received a course of 33 treatments.

Her father Graham, 34, said the trip saved the two-year-old’s life. ‘Lily was really ill. She’d lost a lot of weight and been continuously sick but after eight treatments you could tell it was working,’ he said.

‘She was a different girl to the one who went over there. This treatment doesn’t make a child ill – it just helps them get better.

‘It would be fantastic if the treatment comes to the NHS – it would save the travelling and stress of being away from home. But we’re glad it was available somewhere when Lily needed it.’
