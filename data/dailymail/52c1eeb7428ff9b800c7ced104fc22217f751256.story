England suffered a World Cup aftershock yesterday as they plunged to 20th in the FIFA world rankings, their lowest position for more than 18 years.

Roy Hodgson’s team, having failed to win any of five games in June and taken just one point from three World Cup fixtures, slipped 10 places.

It is a bigger drop than any of the 32 teams in Brazil apart from Australia, and they are now ranked behind Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mexico, the USA and Costa Rica.

England’s lowest position since 
rankings were introduced was 27th in February 1996, which was a result 
of not playing in a competitive game for more than two years because 
they failed to reach the World Cup in 1994 and were automatic qualifiers
 for Euro 96.

Hodgson (right) will be eager to improve the standing before the qualifying groups for the 2018 World Cup in Russia are drawn.

The
 draw will take place in St Petersburg next July and if they follow 
previous protocol, FIFA will use their world rankings to dictate the 
seeds for the nine European groups.

England
 are ranked 12th in Europe and, as it stands, would go into Pot 2, which
 boosts their chances of being grouped with a country such as Germany or
 Spain and reduces their chances of qualifying for the tournament 
itself.

Of the 13 European 
qualifiers for the World Cup in Brazil, eight came  from Pot 1, two from
 Pot 2 and three from Pot 3. After their triumph in Rio last Sunday, 
Germany are ranked  No 1 for the first time in 20 years.

World
 Cup runners-up Argentina are second with Holland third and Colombia 
fourth. Spain slip seven places to eighth. Switzerland, who are 
England’s first opponents in the qualifiers for Euro 2016, in September,
 are ranked ninth.
