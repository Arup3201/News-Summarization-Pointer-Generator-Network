Bad meatloaf from a Bob Evans restaurant in West Virginia killed a former state lawmaker and her husband, according to a lawsuit filed by their children.

Former Delegate Virginia Starcher passed away aged 82 in December 2012 while her husband, Harold, died aged 84 in May 2013 after they both suffered massive complications from food poisoning, the suit claims.

The couple, who were married for 60 years, ate part of their meatloaf meals, which included meatloaf, mashed potatoes, gravy, broccoli and a roll, at a Bob Evans restaurant in Ripley in October 2012.

The meal was the last they would ever have together, according to the lawsuit, which was first reported by the Charleston Daily Mail.

Nine hours later, they both came down with vomiting and diarrhea and were rushed to hospital for food poisoning. Mr Starcher suffered a stroke that day, the lawsuit says.

'Such actions injured Mr. and Mrs. Starcher emotionally which resulted in lost sleep, disturbance of physical condition, extreme anxiety and rapid deterioration of health with consequential death - all requiring the attention of qualified medical personnel,' the lawsuit states.

Mrs Starcher, who had suffered a stroke six years before eating the food, died two months later.

Her husband's health was weakened by the incident and he needed open heart surgery for a heart valve infection in December 2012, the suit claims.

He remained hospitalized until the next April and died at his home in May 2013. 

Missed: Mr Starcher is pictured with his daughter Ann, who has filed the lawsuit with her brother. It explains that her beloved father, a civil engineer, was able to run his own business until they ate the meal

Until he ate the meal, Mr Starcher was still fit to work and run his own business, but after the incident, he became rapidly ill, the lawsuit says.  

The couple's adult children, Mark and Ann Starcher, filed the lawsuit against Bob Evans Farms, which is based in New Albany, Ohio, in Jackson Circuit Court on October 3.

The lawsuit says the couple incurred more than $250,000 in medical costs after the allegedly tainted meal. The court filing asks for a trial by jury. 

Bob Evans spokeswoman Hinda Mitchell said that the chain will vigorously defend itself in the matter.

'While we sympathize with this family for the loss of their loved ones, we believe this claim is without merit,' Mitchell said in an emailed statement.

Battle: Representatives for the restaurant, which is based in Ohio, said the lawsuit had no merit

Virginia 'Ginny' Starcher, 82, first won her seat in Jackson County in 1986 - making her the first woman ever to be elected - and won one state House of Delegates re-election in 1988.

She represented Jackson County and part of Mason County and served until 1991.

Harold 'Punk' Starcher, who enlisted in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, was a civil engineer who owned the Chartwell Corp. of Ripley, according to his obituary.

The couple left behind their two children and two grandchildren.
