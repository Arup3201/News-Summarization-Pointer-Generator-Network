The Army fell short of its recruitment target in 2014, despite the Ministry of Defence's £30million spending on TV adverts.

It has also emerged that up to a third of the Army's top brass will be cut in a command 'revolution'.

The MoD splashed out £14.5millon on Royal Navy commercials, £6million on the Army and £8million on the Royal Air Force.

But despite the lucrative campaign, only 6,000 people signed up to the Army last year - falling shy of the 10,000 it needed.

Failure: espite the lucrative drive to attract recruits, only 6,000 people signed up to the Army last year - well shy of its 10,000 target.

The TV advert figures were revealed after a parliamentary question by Labour's Kevan Jones. 

It has also emerged that up to a third of the Army's top brass will be cut. The plans by General Sir Nicholas Carter, the new head of the army, will see many of the army's 500 colonels and 200 brigadiers axed.

The changes will be in place from April and are designed to reduce bureaucracy and make the force more professional.

It follows revelations in Parliament that another 20,000 cuts to soldiers are also in the pipeline.

Sir Nick Harvey, a former defence minister, told MPs last week that the Ministry of Defence had drawn up secret proposals which would see another 20,000 troops axed.

Under an Armed Forces shake-up, ministers are already cutting the strength of the regular Army by 20,000 to 82,000.

They are also planning to double the part-time Territorial Army – now called the Army Reserve – to 30,000 by 2020.

But the further cuts would reduce the army to just 60,000 regular soldiers.

As well as axing senior officers, General Carter wants to see 'more professional' senior officers which are trained to be loyal to the army rather than to their regiment.

He also wants to end obligatory two-year job rotations, allow career breaks for women to have children that do not affect the chance of promotion and also introduce performance reviews with more honest feedback.

The plans have been set out after decades of weak leadership where commanders are rarely held to account, according to more than a dozen former senior and more junior officers interviewed by The Times.

They added that bureaucracy takes precedence over common sense and people are not encouraged to take risks.

One defence official told The Times: 'It is the revolution.'

Gen Carter's Army Command Review will bring sweeping changes across the whole army. However, General Rupert Smith said it may not go far enough.

He said: 'The [Army] may have improved itself, but it won't make any difference if it isn't put in an improved centre or joint arrangement.'

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said last night: 'The Army Command Review is the next step in the development of Army 2020.

'It builds on the delegated model that Defence has implemented as a result of Lord Levene's report on Defence reforms.

'It will ensure that the Army's command structure and its staff are best placed to meet future challenges in an agile, imaginative and effective manner.'
