Dead: Andrew Robert Levene, accused of killing a jewellery store owner and stealing $300,000 in diamonds, has been found hanged in his prison cell

An American man accused of killing a jewellery store owner, stealing $300,000 in diamonds and then fleeing to Europe has been found hanged in his Spanish prison cell.

Andrew Robert Levene was found dead yesterday in Barcelona's Modelo prison, where he was detained following an international manhunt.

An investigation into the death was under way but all signs indicated he had killed himself.

Levene, 41, was charged with federal murder, robbery and firearm offences in the December 8 shooting of Yekutiel Zeevi.

Zeevi was the owner of the YZ Manufacturers LLC store in Westport, Connecticut. Extradition proceedings in Spain had not yet begun.

A Catalonia justice department spokesman said that, as with all people admitted to prison, Levene had been interviewed by prison authorities and showed no signs that he might do himself harm.

Levene contacted Zeevi in early December, asking him for several diamonds that were valued between $45,000 and $75,000, U.S. authorities said.

The evening before the shooting Zeevi met Levene, who examined the diamonds and was non-committal about buying them.

Levene met with Zeevi again on December 8 under the ruse that he would buy several large diamonds. Instead, Levene is said to have shot and killed Zeevi.

Levene, who had military training in the use of weapons, then stole about $300,000 in diamonds.

Ronen Konfino, an executive at a New York diamond business, also was shot but survived and helped police with the investigation.

Levene travelled from Philadelphia to the Dutch capital of Amsterdam on December 11 after missing a flight to Madrid.

It was not immediately known why he had travelled to Barcelona or when he had arrived there.

U.S. Embassy officials in Madrid said yesterday they were notified that Levene, also known as Robert Thomas, had died but could give no further details.

Nava Zeevi, the widow of the jewellery store owner, told FoxNews.com she thought her husband's alleged killer 'got what he deserved'.

She said: 'He did a cowardly act, I really don't care. I'm just happy he's not here anymore. Let him rot in hell.

'He would have gotten a lesser sentence in the trial, which would have talen a very long time. For me, it was a very happy day to learn about it, and for my family as well.'

Westport city official Gordon Joseloff said Levene's apparent suicide is a tragedy for everyone, and called it 'a cowardly confirmation of his guilt'.

He said: 'Not only has the suspect taken the life of a beloved Westport resident and caused immeasurable pain to the Zeevi family and friends here, he has now inflicted the same pain on his own family, also innocents in this tragedy.'
