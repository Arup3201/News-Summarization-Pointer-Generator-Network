What do you get a child born not only with the proverbial silver spoon in their mouth but the whole canteen?

How about a fully-working, James Bond-style miniature Aston Martin DB5 – complete with smoke bombs and a pop-up bullet-proof windshield – or a rocking horse with a mallet carved from an ancient oak tree which once stood on the lawn of the White House?

A new exhibition at Buckingham Palace – Royal Childhood – which opens on Saturday brings together more than 150 treasured toys, outfits and nursery items belonging to nine generations of children who have called the royal residence home.

Starting with the future King George 
IV in the 18th Century, right up to his namesake, Prince George of 
Cambridge, William and Kate’s adored one-year-old son, it gives an 
unprecedented glimpse into life as a young member of the world’s most 
famous family.

Among the 
most eye-catching items in the display is a casket containing the first 
teeth of each of Queen’s Victoria’s children and a ‘behaviour book’ 
about her own conduct as a young girl.

In
 the week of November 3 1831 she was recorded as being ‘very thoughtless
 and foolish’ and ‘impertinent’, while on Monday September 25 1832 she 
was described as ‘very very very very horribly naughty!!!!!!’

But it is the gifts given to younger members of the Royal Family over the years that prove to be some of the most fascinating.

In
 1932 the people of Wales presented the then Princess Elizabeth, or 
Lilibet as she was known to close family, with a miniature thatched 
cottage on her sixth birthday, ‘Y Bwthyn Bach’ or ‘The Little House’.

It was constructed in the grounds of Royal Lodge at Windsor and boasts electric lighting and running water.

Elizabeth
 adored the house as have many of her heirs. Indeed, her grand-daughter 
Princess Beatrice loved it so much that recently she arranged for some 
of the soft furnishing, such as curtains, that had become a little 
frayed around the edges, to be sympathetically replaced.

Its miniature kitchen has now been recreated at Buckingham Palace.

One of the most eye-catching gifts is the mini Rollalong Caravan given to Prince Charles and Princess Anne  in 1955.

At
 less than seven feet long, it still came with its own water, gas and 
electricity supply, a child-sized kitchen, miniature tea set – and 
complete collection of Beatrix Potter books.

As
 it was not motorised the caravan had a tow-hitch enabling the Duke of 
Edinburgh to pull his children around the grounds of Buckingham Palace 
using am old Hillman Husky borrowed from the Royal Mews.

Prince
 Andrew must have been the envy of his friends, however, when at the age
 of just six he was presented by Aston Martin a miniature replica of the
 DB5 used by James Bond in the films Goldfinger and Thunderball.

The items are part of a collection of well-loved toys, treasured family presents, photographs and tiny outfits belonging to nine generations of royal children

Artefacts on display are associated with more than 25 royal children including the Duke of Cambridge, Prince Harry and the Prince of Wales

Toy cars, tractors and tricycles ridden by royal children including the ultimate young boys' toy - a scaled down version of James Bond¿s DB5 sports car

Not
 only was the car fully mobile - with a top speed of ten miles per hour -
 it had all the gadgets famously added to the full-size vehicle: 
rotating number plates, a pop-up bullet proof shield, machine guns 
concealed behind the side lights (presumably without real bullets), a 
working smoke-screen and electric water jets hidden in the rear 
reflectors.

More recently 
President Barak Obama and his wife, First Lady Michelle, gave Prince 
George an Alpaca blanket with a hand-stitched message.

They
 also sent over from the States a rocking horse with a miniature polo 
mallet carved from an oak tree that once stood on the South Lawn of the 
White House.

Harry when he went into hospital for an operation when he was three and 
Prince William’s school exercise book.

Prince
 George’s Honiton lace christening gown and the spectacular silver-gilt 
christening font used to baptise him are also on display along with the 
official announcement of his birth.

Royal
 Childhood runs from Saturday July 26 until September 28 as part of the 
annual Summer Opening of the State Apartments at Buckingham Palace.
