Chicago's close-knit acting community suffered a double blow this weekend as two of its stars were killed in tragic accidents over two days.

Bernie Yvon, a 50-year-old actor who has starred in dozens of musicals in Chicago and its suburbs including the 'Music Man' and 'Mary Poppins', died on Saturday in a car crash.

He was en route to Theatre af the Center in Munster, Indiana, where he was rehearsing a musical, 'Women On The Verge of a Nervous Breakdown', which was scheduled to open next week.

Chicago actors Bernie Yvon and Molly Glynn both died Saturday in separate accidents that have devastated the local theater community. Both were in the prime of their careers

Glynn, a veteran of the Chicago theater and actress appearing in notable television dramas, died Saturday after being struck by a tree while bicycling a forest preserve trail

'We are are all in shock and denial,' William Pullinsi, the veteran 
artistic director of the theater, told the Chicago Tribune. 'We did all 
kinds of shows together. He had so many friends in the business.'

Molly Glynn, 46, also a veteran of Chicago theater who also appeared in notable television dramas, died on Saturday a day after being struck by a tree while bicycling a forest preserve trail.

A memorial trust fund that was set up in her name has already raised $79,000 from 1,106 donations, just shy of the $85,000 goal, according to GiveForward.

The deaths of Glynn and Yvon was especially 'overwhelming'  because the actors were in the prime of their stage careers and well respected by their peers, according to Chris Jones, the Chicago Tribune's chief theater critic.

The events prompted much mourning in rehearsal rooms across the city and backstage in playhouses, he wrote. Technical rehearsals for 'King Lear' at Chicago Shakespeare Theater stopped, while the actor Lance Baker posted on Facebook: 'Grief has become near-catatonia'.

'Glynn was known for her intellect, good looks, honesty and feisty personality. Yvon, a classic, twinkle-eyed song-and-dance-man in the old tradition, was known for his charm, warmth, bonhomie and formidable chops on a stage,' Jones wrote. 'Their deaths cast a pall Saturday everywhere from the Goodman Theatre downtown to the Marriott Theatre in suburban Lincolnshire. Taken together, these two esteemed actors had worked almost everywhere.'

Police arrived on scene on Friday to find Glynn horribly injured by the falling tree. She was pronounced dead the next day

Police officers arriving at the scene of Yvon's accident said they found a white 2007 freightliner semi-tractor trailer sitting on top of the actor's gray Toyota four-door vehicle, according to NBC. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

An investigation is ongoing but preliminary information suggests Yvon was attempting to make a left-hand turn when the semi struck his car.

'This is a tremendous loss of a fantastic performer and treasured colleague,' said Richard Friedman, general manager of Theatre at the Center, Richard Friedman, NBC reported . 'Bernie made everyone he met feel better about life and every audience member who saw Bernie's work was fortunate to be entertained by a masterful artist.'

Yvon had some Broadway credits, such as starring as Harry Houdini in a production of 'Ragtime', but most of his work was performed around Chicago. He played Lumiere in 'Beauty and the Beast', the pharaoh in 'Joseph' and the genie in 'Aladdin', among many other roles, according to the Marriott Theatre's bio on Yvon.

“Bernie Yvon was a triple threat – an immensely talented singer, dancer, and actor – who solidly delivered in any production that I ever cast him in through the years,' Pullinsi said. 'Audiences just loved him. He was always upbeat, positive and kind and the Chicagoland theater community is in deep mourning of a great man.'

Glynn, seen here with husband Joe Foust, regularly appeared in prestigious Chicago theater productions and gained national attention with television credits on shows like 'Boss' and 'Chicago Fire'

Glynn died after getting caught in a storm along with her husband and fellow actor Joe Foust. The tempest's winds were so powerful that they uprooted a tree and sent it crashing into Glynn's path, according to the Chicago Tribune.

'She's gone,' Foust wrote on Facebook early Saturday, according to NBC Chicago.

'I couldn't save her.'

Besides
 recognition across the Chicago theater community for her regular 
appearances on prestigious stages such as Steppenwolf, Writers, Next, 
Chicago Shakespeare, and Northlight, she gained national attention with 
television credits on shows like 'Boss' and 'Chicago Fire.'Glynn was remembered as 'a beautiful woman and one would think that she would only be a leading 
lady, but the truth is she also had great skill and breadth and scope as
 an actress,' said Northlight Theatre artistic director BJ Jones in a statement to the The Chicago Tribune.

'In a cast 
she was a strong, stabilizing influence.  A real pillar in the cast. And
 when she walked on stage, you knew you were in good hands. You knew 
that you were seeing the truest colors of the character and the play,' 
he added.
