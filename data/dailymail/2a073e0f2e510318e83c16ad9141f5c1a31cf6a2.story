Nick Clegg’s controversial taxpayer-funded election strategist was censured  by a watchdog over his role in the awarding of a multi-million-pound contract.

Ryan Coetzee, who has been given the £110,000-a-year job of rescuing the Lib Dems’ plunging poll ratings, was accused of ‘maladministration’ in an official probe into suspected cronyism.

Mr Coetzee, who arrived at Westminster after nearly 20 years in South African politics, was at the centre of a pay row  last week when it emerged that, unlike his rival Labour and Conservative election gurus, his salary comes from public rather than party funds.

Intrigue has followed him around in his native country, where he started his career in 1997 as a 24-year-old strategist for the Democratic Party.

He went on to serve as an MP and chief executive of the party and then advised Helen Zille, premier of the Western Cape province.

Last year South Africa’s Public Protector, an anti-corruption watchdog, investigated Mr Coetzee’s role in the awarding of a £4 million communications contract by Ms Zille’s government to a company called TBWA Hunt Lascaris.

The Protector, Thuli Madonsela, launched her investigation after a whistleblower raised questions about why the contract had been awarded without being publicly advertised, as required by law.

An interim report said Mr Coetzee’s role in drafting the tender specifications for the contract, then evaluating the bid and not taking proper minutes, was illegal and should lead to disciplinary action.

After Mr Coetzee’s team mounted a legal challenge, the conclusion was that his involvement was ‘improper’ and he had been implicated in ‘maladministration’.

Mr Coetzee said the whistleblower was involved in a smear campaign.

A South African political source said last night: ‘Throughout his career Ryan  has specialised in blurring the lines between political work, civil service work and commercial work.

He is now doing the same in the UK.’

Last night a Liberal Democrat spokesman said: ‘The Protector cleared Ryan of any wrongdoing in connection with the communications tender.

‘There were minor technical flaws in the way the tender was administered, but overall the tender  was valid.’
