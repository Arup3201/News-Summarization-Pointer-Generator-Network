More than one million people are expected to attend 15 Rugby World Cup fanzones when the tournament takes place this autumn.

Organisers England Rugby 2015 on Thursday announced fanzone locations - featuring big screens, entertainment, food and drink and rugby activities - in each of the World Cup host cities, plus at the game's birthplace in Rugby and in London's Trafalgar Square.

Also announced on Thursday was the Rugby World Cup trophy tour in the UK and Ireland, which begins on June 10.

The 100 day continuous tour of the Webb Ellis Cup will visit Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Wales and England, and arrive at Twickenham Stadium on September 18 ahead of the opening ceremony prior to the first game, between hosts England and Fiji in Group A.

Debbie Jevans, chief executive officer of England Rugby 2015, said: 'The countdown to Rugby World Cup 2015 is on and fans can now really begin to plan their tournament experience, be it through watching the matches, through fanzones, the festival of rugby and the Rugby World Cup trophy tour.

'Capacities will range from 2,000 to over 10,000 and we would like to thank all of our host cities, local authorities and the Mayor of London for their fantastic support and we look forward to welcoming upwards of one million people to the official fanzones.

'The Rugby World Cup trophy tour will be the perfect opportunity to excite and engage fans across the UK and Ireland and make 2015 feel like the year of the rugby nation.

'Delivering a continuous 100 day tour means we can give as many fans as possible the opportunity to see the Webb Ellis Cup.'

Fanzones will be free to enter, open on matchdays and at varying times across the six-week tournament, which concludes with the October 31 final at Twickenham.

The trophy tour follows an international tour, which has to date seen the Webb Ellis Cup make 12 of its 15 visits, with Canada, Germany and France to follow before the return to the UK.

Over 300 events are to be incorporated in the tour.
