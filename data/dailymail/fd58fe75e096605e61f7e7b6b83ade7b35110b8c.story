Most wanted: Warwick Spinks, a violent paedophile who was on the run for 15 years, has been arrested at Heathrow Airport after he was found in the Czech Republic

A violent paedophile who was on the run for 15 years has been found in the Czech Republic and arrested after a major international manhunt, a child protection unit has today confirmed.

Warwick Andrew Spinks, 48, was arrested at Heathrow Airport after he was tracked down by officers from the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop).

The 48 year old had used various aliases while on the run, including Willem Van Wijk and William Spinks.

His horrifying back catalogue of abuse led to his nickname 'the Pied Piper of Paedophiles' after he bragged he could arrange sex with young boys for as little as 10p.

He was convicted in 1995 of a series of sexual offences against boys, including serious sexual assault at knifepoint, taking a child without lawful authority and taking indecent images of children.

He was jailed for seven years but this was reduced to a five-year term on appeal.

In 1997, while on release on licence, Spinks went missing and fled the UK.

He now faces serving the remaining 18 months of his sentence.

Ceop chief executive Peter Davies said: 'Ceop officers, in conjunction with officers at the Metropolitan Police Service and Soca (Serious Organised Crime Agency), have worked tirelessly over a number of years to locate and trace a high-risk child sexual offender, who believed he could avoid being managed in the UK by travelling overseas.

'I hope this arrest sends a clear message to other missing child sexual offenders that however far you travel to avoid facing the consequences of your actions, we will track you down and bring you to justice.'

The abuser was first investigated in 1992, after police suspected he had links with paedophile rings in the UK and Europe.

He acted as a 'fixer' in Amsterdam, the Sunday People reports, where he introduced sex tourists looking for underage boys.

He told undercover officers from the Metropolitan and Dutch police he could pick up young boys from German, Prague and Poland for as little as 10p.

He was also caught on secret camera offering to supply a video in which a 10 year old boy was killed and one featuring the horrific abuse of a young boy.

When Spinks was sentenced in 1995 at Lewes Crown Court for a string of offences against under-age boys, the court heard how he drugged a 14 year old boy and 'sold him' to a gay brothel in Amsterdam.
