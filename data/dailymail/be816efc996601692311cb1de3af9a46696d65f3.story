Two Ryanair flight attendants have been hospitalised after turbulence forced a Reus to Brussels Charleroi flight to make an emergency landing at Bordeaux Airport.

The Boeing 737-800 experienced severe turbulence over the Pyrenees region and was reported to have landed safely in Bordeaux.

Local media reports one member of staff was hit by the drinks trolley and suffered a broken ankle, while another was 'propelled' to the ceiling and suffered a back injury.

A Ryanair spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: 'This flight from Reus to Brussels Charleroi diverted to Bordeaux after experiencing some air turbulence.

The Ryanair flight was said to have been caught in a 'big air pocket'  that caused the plane to be rocked when over the Pyrenees

'A spare aircraft and replacement crew were sent from Barcelona to minimise the delay for customers, who were provided with refreshment vouchers in Bordeaux. 

'Ryanair apologised sincerely to all customers affected by this diversion and delay.'

Speaking to French news site 20 minutes, a spokesperson for Bordeaux Mérignac Airport said: 'The flight was rocked by large, heavy turbulence as it passed over the Pyrenees and there were huge 'bubbles' and [the] hostess was propelled to the ceiling.

'[It was] caught in a big air pocket, the plane was badly shaken and two hostesses were injured.'
