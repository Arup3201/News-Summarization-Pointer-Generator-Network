The last time Roger Federer lost this early at the Australian Open the world was a very different place.

In January 2001 the dreadful events of 9/11, for example, had yet to happen. There was no such thing as Facebook or Twitter, and the great Swiss was still two-and-a-half years from winning his first Wimbledon.

It is almost a whole career ago for Federer, who showed he is now much nearer the end than the beginning with his third-round exit at the hands of world No 46 Andreas Seppi.

Andreas Seppi’s third-round win ensures Federer’s earliest Australian Open exit since 2001.

Federer went down to a 6-4, 7-6, 4-6, 7-6 defeat in which he seemed to feel all of his 33 years, producing an unexpectedly sluggish display against a player he had beaten 10 times out of 10 before Friday.

Nobody would have thought he would be heading back to Europe before Rafael Nadal, who came in so desperately out of form but is now safely into the fourth round. It is a tribute to Federer that Melbourne Park was in a state of shock after his loss to the uncelebrated Italian, and that the result should spark such debate.

There is so much mileage on the clock, so little to prove for the now father of four, that it is extraordinary he arrived as one of the favourites following such a successful 2014.

He had not even started this year badly, winning the Brisbane Open by beating, among others, Grigor Dimitrov, whom he could have played again here in the quarter-finals were he to beat Andy Murray in the fourth round.

While Seppi is no slouch — his winning forehand pass was a shot for the ages — Federer admitted he was at a loss about his display. He made vague references to having a poor feel for the ball in the two previous days, and when it had come to producing his best form at the most important time he had failed.

Of course, this is just one loss so far this season, but it completes his recent collection of unscheduled exits from Grand Slams. In 2013 he lost in the second and fourth rounds of Wimbledon and the US Open respectively, while last May he tumbled out of Roland Garros in the fourth round.

Federer is now going to take a scheduled holiday, just a little earlier than expected. He always planned it this way because of an unusually truncated off-season and Friday's loss may have have been connected to its brevity. During his rebound season of 2014 he emphasised how important his break and training bloc had been to lay the foundations.

This time he did not finish the official year until late November due to the Davis Cup final, while in December he travelled to India to make a $4million appearance in the International Premier Tennis League.

Given his charity efforts and corporate work in Switzerland, he would hardly have had time to catch his breath before heading to Australia for the start of this season.

Federer pondered this at length afterwards. ‘It allowed me to stay in rhythm and plan to take a break after here,’ he said. ‘I was playing great leading into the tournament so I don’t want to say I peaked too soon. But then again, margins are small and these things happen. Clearly I will have a look at it but I don’t think I did anything wrong.’

He now has four weeks off before his next tournament, at his secondary home of Dubai, and by then there will be another Australian Open champion.

The feeling persists that by far his best chance of getting one more Grand Slam is Wimbledon this summer — and that would be three years after his last one.

Nadal, who suffered cramp during his nervy five-set win over American Tim Smyczek on Wednesday, was fully restored in asserting his superiority over Dudi Sela, the world No 106, winning 6-1, 6-1, 7-5.

The key thing for the Spaniard is to be able to play matches, as he has been unable to string together any kind of run since Wimbledon last year. If his confidence fully returns then many stranger things have happened than him winning this title.

Nadal’s next opponent will be South African giant Kevin Anderson, currently at a career-high ranking of 15. Federer will be watching from his holiday idyll somewhere, or trying to ignore it.
