A mother and her three children have been killed after their car was buried by drifts after a weekend of heavy snow in Japan.

At the weekend nine people were killed on Hokkaido island due to the poor weather including the family.

Kazuyo Miyashita, 40, her two daughters Misa, 17, and Sayo, 14, and her son Daiki, 11, were trapped in their car during a snow storm.

Trapped: Policemen shovel snow around a vehicle of Kazuyo Miyashita. The mother and her three children died at a hospital Saturday night of carbon-monoxide poisoning after the vehicle got buried in the snow

Dangerous: Heavy snow that fell on the main northern Japanese island of Hokkaido over the weekend has killed eight people, including the family

Despite the best efforts of rescuers, they died at a hospital on Saturday night of 
carbon-monoxide poisoning, 
according to Kyodo news service.

The body of fisherman Mikio Okada, 53, was found on Sunday with his daughter Natsune, nine, who was crying and suffering from severe frostbite.

Mr Okada had wrapped his daughter in his jacket and was holding her in his arms against a warehouse wall.

Relatives raised the alarm after the pair failed to return home on Saturday afternoon.

Mr Okada had called family members at 4pm to say the pair were going to walk the last kilometre home after his truck got stuck in the snow, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper.

But they were found only 300 metres away from the truck at 7am the next morning.

The newspaper reported that Natsune's
mother died two years ago and that Mr Okada would often delay the start
of his working day to sit down for breakfast with his daughter.

Killed: A 53-year-old man died Sunday after getting buried in the snow, although his 9-year-old daughter found with him was recovering, Kyodo said

Also over the weekend, a 54-year-old 
man and a 76-year-old man were found collapsed in the snow in another 
part of Hokkaido, and both were confirmed dead, Kyodo news service said.

Separately, Haruna Kitagawa, 23, froze to death after leaving her car, stuck in the snow.Â 

The body of Kuniko Jingi, 76, was found lying in the street after she also left her snowed-in vehicle.

The
storm caused two-metre-high (six-and-a-half-feet) drifts and was blamed
for derailing a bullet train in Akita prefecture, south of Hokkaido, on
Saturday afternoon.

The bullet train's 130 passengers walked away unharmed after the derailment

The passenger train was moving slowly at only 12mph because of the heavy snow on the tracks.

The train's 130 passengers, travelling in six carriages, walked away unharmed after the driver performed an emergency stop.

The front carriage came off the tracks at about 4.05pm.

But they had to wait for six hours on
the train, which stopped at the city of Daisen, before buses came to 
rescue them while investigators got to work.

Reduced services started again on the line today after the accident.

Services on the line resumed today after Saturday afternoon's derailment
