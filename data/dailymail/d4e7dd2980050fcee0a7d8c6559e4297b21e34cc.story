Police have said Schuessler had been living with Monica Krueger and Emma for about three months, KWCH has reported.

Lt Todd Ojile has said it is an 'extremely difficult' case to investigate.

More than 40 people attended a prayer vigil for Emma outside the hospital where she died last Wednesday night, according to KAKE.com.

At the time, Emma's cousin Jacob Rufe said: 'It just shows how many good-hearted people are really out there and how many people really care.'
