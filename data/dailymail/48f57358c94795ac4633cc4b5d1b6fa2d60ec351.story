Sportsmail take a trip into the Wimbledon 'Locker Room' - the place where you can find out some of the best of action on offer.

Dan Evans is our pick in Brit Watch, plus we give the lowdown on the seed in danger. Discover which game is the ground pass bonus and find out the all-important, weather forecast for Monday's opening day of drama at SW19.

Dan Evans, the British men’s No 2, has a winnable tie against Andrey Kuznetsov third up on Court No 2.

The 23-year-old Russian is 30 places above Evans in the world rankings at No 114 but if the Birmingham-born player can repeat his form from Queen’s, where he beat world No 52 Jurgen Melzer, a home win is very plausible.

Sloane Stephens, 18th seed, faces a real test in Maria Kirilenko. The Russian made the quarter-finals in 2012 and was world No 10 last June. Her WTA ranking, currently 87, has suffered through an injury-enforced absence.

Dustin Brown against Marcos Baghdatis (second on Court 12) could be a very entertaining duel.

The dreadlocked Brown stormed Wimbledon last year when he beat Lleyton Hewitt, and less than a fortnight ago he destroyed Rafael Nadal in straight sets at Halle.

Popular Baghdatis has made the semi-finals here, of course.
