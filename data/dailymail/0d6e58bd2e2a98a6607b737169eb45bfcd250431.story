The TSA officer shot dead by a gunman at Los Angeles International Airport earlier this month lay bleeding for 33 minutes before paramedics helped him, it has emerged.

Law enforcement officials have revealed that paramedics were forced to wait just 150 yards from where Gerardo Hernandez was wounded because police had not declared the terminal safe to enter.

The gunman, Paul Ciancia, was only active for five of the 33 minutes; after that there was no threat
 as he had been shot and was in custody.

Hernandez, who was only 20 feet from the exit, was eventually wheeled out by police to an ambulance - but the married father-of-two could not be saved.

Questions: Gerardo Hernandez, 39, was left to bleed for 33 minutes after he was shot by the LAX gunman. Investigations are now underway to determine what conversations police and fire officials had

Officials are now examining what conversations took place between police and fire commanders to determine when it was safe to enter the building following the November 1 shooting.

They are also looking at whether paramedics could have gone inside earlier to help Hernandez, although it is not known if he would have survived after immediate medical attention.

Formal conclusions may take months to reach, but what's known raises the possibility that a lack of coordination between police and fire officials prevented speedy treatment for Hernandez and others.

The tragedy unfolded after Paul Ciancia, a 23-year-old unemployed motorcycle mechanic, entered Terminal 3 with a duffel bag, pulled out an assault rifle and started shooting, authorities said.

They added that he had a note in his 
bag that said he wanted to 'kill TSA' and that he wanted to stir fear in
 them, criticizing their searches as unconstitutional.

He fatally shot Hernandez and injured another officer, Tony Grigsby, who is recovering.

Ciancia was then shot by airport police officers four times, in the mouth and leg, before being taken into custody. He remains in fair condition in hospital and will appear in court when he is well enough.

The Associated Press explained that paramedics did not immediately rush inside due to concerns there could be further threats inside - such as bombs or accomplices.

After Hernandez was shot, officers from multiple agencies bent down to check on Hernandez before moving on, officials said. None administered first aid.

Police broadcast over their radios that Ciancia was in custody at 9.25am, five minutes after Hernandez was shot in the chest.

A nearly 26-year veteran Los Angeles police officer then checked on Hernandez several times, repeatedly telling officers who came by from various agencies 'he's dead', an official said.

When Hernandez was finally taken to hospital, trauma surgeon David Plurad said Hernandez had no signs of life. Doctors worked for about an hour to revive him despite significant blood loss.

'When somebody is shot and they're bleeding to death, lifesaving skills need to be implemented immediately, in a couple minutes, and they're very simple, pressure dressings, tourniquets, adequate bandages to stop the bleeding,' said Dr. Lawrence E. Heiskell, an emergency physician for 27 years and a reserve police officer for 24 years who founded the International School of Tactical Medicine.

Responding to a situation with a shooter on the loose has changed since the 1999 Columbine school massacre, when officials huddled outside to formulate a plan while shooters continued firing inside and a teacher bled to death without timely treatment.

Now police immediately charge in to stop the shooting as quickly as possible; officers are trained to step over the wounded and stop the gunman first, then tend to victims.

During active shooter training last month with the LAX police and LAPD, Los Angeles city firefighters wearing ballistic vests and helmets dragged survivors to areas where they could provide treatment.

Because police are often the first at the scene where there are injuries, California law requires officers receive first aid and CPR training in the academy and regular refreshers afterward.

A recent audit by Los Angeles Police Commission Inspector General Alex Bustamante found that the LAPD had a zero percent compliance rate.

Only 250-sworn officers in the Metropolitan Division out of the department's more than 9,900 sworn officers received the refresher training, it states. Airport police have the training.

The Los Angeles 
Police Department, Los Angeles Fire Department and Los Angeles Airport 
Police said they couldn't comment on the ongoing investigation until reports are finished.

For now, TSA workers are left wondering if Hernandez could have been saved if he had been seen to earlier, said Victor Payes, 
who works at the airport and is president of the local union.

'I 
basically think there's a lack of coordination between entities at this 
airport. That lack of coordination may have led to something that 
shouldn't have happened,' Payes said. 'We may be talking about Officer 
Hernandez as a survivor.'
