Former Tottenham sporting director Damien Comolli has lifted the lid on the disastrous year when Juande Ramos was in charge.

Ramos, whose Dnipro side lead Spurs 1-0 going into the second leg of their Europa League tie on Thursday, recently blamed the club for ruining his reputation in England.

But Comolli, who worked with the Spanish manager at White Hart Lane in 2007-08, claims Ramos:

Hitting back: Former Spurs sporting director Damien Comolli has lifted the lid on the disastrous year when Juande Ramos, now boss of Dnipro, was in charge at White Hart Lane

All smiles at the start: Comolli, left, and Ramos were on good terms when the Spaniard joined but the pair's working relationship would not stay so healthy

At the beginning: Ramos was hired in 2007 but would not last long as Spurs boss

Comolli says Ramos was out of touch with the Barclays Premier League and did not listen to advice from chairman Daniel Levy and the board to adapt his style of management from Spain.

‘One thing that worried me straight away after we appointed him from Sevilla was something their sporting director Monchi told me,’ said Comolli, 41.

‘He was a friend of mine, so I rang and apologised for taking their manager halfway through the season.

'He said that the coach from their reserve team was probably better than Ramos and that we’d soon find out he’s not the reason for the club’s success.’

But within four months of taking over from Martin Jol, Ramos won the Carling Cup, the club’s first trophy since 1999.

‘We thought we were on to something good,’ said Comolli. But behind the scenes the situation was turning into a nightmare.

‘When you interview a manager or a potential candidate you put the culture of your club, what you’re about, on the table straight away.

'We made it clear to him we couldn’t afford to buy stars, we wanted to make them. We couldn’t compete with Chelsea or Manchester United like that. He said, “No problem, I’m good at that”.

'He mentioned he was the coach of Barcelona B. Then as soon as he came in, he said, “I want Samuel Eto’o and David Villa”. He wasn’t interested in young players at all.’

Not enough: Ramos, near left, signed, left to right, Chris Gunter, Woodgate, Alan Hutton and Giberto but wanted bigger names at Spurs

Unrealistic targets: David Villa, left, and Samuel Eto'o were two transfer targets Ramos wanted to sign for Spurs but the club could not afford their wages

At the insistence of Ramos, Comolli met the two players’ representatives.

‘Eto’o was already on four times what our biggest earner was on and his agent said he wanted more. It was impossible with Villa as well. Tottenham just couldn’t sign players like that.’

While Ramos was in charge, the club had Gareth Bale and Luka Modric, who would later move to Real Madrid for combined fees of £118million.

Spurs finished 11th in the first season he took over and in the following campaign he was axed with the club bottom, on two points after eight games.

European ticket secured: Within two seasons of Harry Redknapp taking over at Spurs, the club were in the Champions League

Harry Redknapp replaced him and two seasons later they qualified for the Champions League.

Ramos sold Younes Kaboul and Jermain Defoe — two players Redknapp brought back, Defoe for twice the price they received from Portsmouth for him.

Comolli worked under Arsene Wenger at Arsenal and saw first-hand the training methods of tactician Steve Clarke at Liverpool, so speaks from experience when he says: ‘Harry instilled in the side a good team spirit, trusted the players and they rewarded him.

‘With Ramos the players didn’t trust him. He tried to convince the board the players we had were poor but we had great players.

'He couldn’t use them or get the best out of them, couldn’t connect with them or get any kind of team spirit.

‘He pushed them so hard in training they got injuries. They were too tired mentally and physically from his training regime. I felt the players went into games tactically underprepared.’

Help not wanted: Gus Poyet, left, was brought in to help Ramos, centre, but he would not discuss team selection with the Uruguayan

Tottenham brought in Gus Poyet to help but Ramos would not discuss team selection with the Uruguayan.

Problems mounted in the first pre-season Ramos had at the club in 2008. ‘It started to become a nightmare,’ recalled Comolli. ‘Training died, the relationship with players was gone, there was no dialogue with them.’

It came to a head when Spurs had their worst start to a top-flight season.

Decision made: Spurs chairman Daniel Levy, centre, fired Ramos in 2008 when the club made their worst start to a top-flight season

Comolli, Poyet and first-team coach Marcos Alvarez were fired when Ramos was.

‘I lost my job because of him but after he left we kept in touch,’ said Comolli.

‘I
 always protected his name. I prefer to remember him as the person who 
brought a trophy to Spurs rather than by all the stuff he has said 
recently.’
