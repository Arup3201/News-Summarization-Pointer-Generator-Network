A dog-mad entrepreneur has opened a new restaurant where dogs and their owners are served as equals.

Dog lovers and their four-legged friends can enjoy a spot of lunch together at Cardiff's The Doggy Deli and Barkery. 

Owner Leanne Couch, 29, said: 'We definitely see our customers and their dogs as equals, they're one and the same.

'I wanted to create a space where dog owners could come and relax with each other.

'Most diners don't want dogs running around, bothering the customers. At our doggy diner, we love the dogs and we only really want dog lovers coming in.

While human customers can tuck into a cup of tea with a homemade cupcake, their doggy dinner dates can be spoiled with a wagguccino - a big bowl of frothy milk - with sausages or special dog-friendly cakes.

The hounds menu includes raw peanut butter pup-cakes, doggy beer, and Bill + Margot dog ice-cream

Other items on the hounds menu include doggy beer (Barkers Brew' beef and chicken), raw peanut butter pup-cakes and Billy + Margot dog ice-cream. 

Humans customers are also offered a selection of muffins and bagels as well as teacakes and scones. 

The restaurant also offers special doggy birthday cakes edged with biscuit bones for four-legged parties.  

'It is probably one of my best ideas yet,' said Mrs Couch.  

The recently opened doggy diner was so popular on its first day that Mrs Couch needed to bring in extra staff

'There is such an amazing atmosphere - while the dogs eat their sausages and cakes and drink their wagguccinos, their owners sit around socialising.

'It's calm and natural - the complete opposite of a usual pet-led activity.

People can just drop their dogs off and chill while their dogs ran around playing with each other.'

The recently opened doggy diner experienced such a rush on its first day that Mrs Couch needed to bring in extra staff to help wash up.

'I wasn't prepared. Luckily I had lots of help but we were absolutely swamped with customers.

'It was overwhelming. I'm finding it hard to sleep at the moment with the excitement of it all,' Mrs Couch continued. 

The Doggy Deli and Barkery in Crwys Road, Cardiff is not the first of its kind in the UK. That distinction goes to London's first dog cafe, Scooby's Boutique Coffee Bar in Muswell Hill, which opened its doors in January this year.
