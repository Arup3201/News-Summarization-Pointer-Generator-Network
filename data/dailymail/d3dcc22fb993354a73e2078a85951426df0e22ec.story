'Game-changer': The Crispr technique for altering DNA is believed to be so accurate it could help cure diseases like HIV, and also save IVF babies from chronic conditions

Leading geneticists last night hailed a ‘jaw-dropping’ new form of gene therapy which could transform the treatment of incurable disorders.

The new technique allows scientists to edit genetic information with great precision for the first time.

The breakthrough means detailed alterations can be made to human DNA, potentially allowing scientists to treat genetic disorders such as sickle-cell anaemia, Down syndrome and Huntington’s disease.

Scientists believe the technique is so accurate it might be used for gene therapy - replacing faulty genes with healthy ones - on incurable viruses such as HIV and diseases such as cancer.

Controversially, it might also be used to correct gene defects in human IVF embryos, allowing disorders to be ‘ironed out’ before a baby is born.

Previously gene therapy relied on using viruses to insert DNA at random into the human genome - an inaccurate and risky process.

The new technique, called ‘Crispr’, uses ‘cutting enzymes’ to target specific parts of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes, without introducing unintended mutations or flaws.

Nobel Prize winner Professor Craig Mello last night described the new technique as ‘a real game-changer’.

Writing in the Independent, he said: ‘Crispr is absolutely huge.

‘It’s incredibly powerful and it has many applications, from agriculture to potential gene therapy in humans.

‘This is really a triumph of basic science. It’s a tremendous breakthrough with huge implications for molecular genetics. It’s a real game-changer.

‘It’s one of those things that you have to see to believe. I read the scientific papers like everyone else but when I saw it working in my own lab, my jaw dropped. A total novice in my lab got it to work.’

'Jaw-dropping': Nobel prize-winning scientist Craig Mello praised the technique, which he said even a novice could use

Prof Mello said that the technique ‘lowers the threshold’ for carrying out gene therapy on human IVF embryos.

Gene therapy on sperm, eggs or embryos, which theoretically could eliminate inherited diseases in babies, is currently illegal in Britain and many other countries.

But Prof Mello said the new technique could address many of the safety concerns of ‘germline’ gene therapy because it is so accurate, although he warned that its use in IVF was some way off because potential ‘off-target effects’ could lead to ‘unintended consequences’.

Dr Dagan Wells, an IVF scientist at Oxford University, told the Independent: ‘If this new technique succeeds in allowing perfectly targeted correction of abnormal genes, eliminating safety concerns, then the exciting prospect is that treatments could be developed and applied to the germline, ridding families and all their descendants of devastating inherited disorders.’

‘It would be difficult to argue against using it if it can be shown to be as safe, reliable and effective as it appears to be. Who would condemn a child to terrible suffering and perhaps an early death when a therapy exists, capable of repairing the problem?’

The technique might also have applications in agriculture, potentially accelerating the development of GM crops and livestock.

The Crispr process, which stands for ‘clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats’, was dismissed as ‘junk DNA’ when it was discovered by Japanese scientists in 1987

It has since been identified as a defence used by bacteria against invading viruses, and last year scientists in California published a landmark study showing it could be used to target any genome.

In recent months scientists in American universities have used the Crispr process to edit the DNA of mouse embryos and even human stem cells grown in test tubes.

Dr David Adams, a DNA scientist at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge, said the technique has the potential to transform the way scientists are able to manipulate the genes of all living organisms.

‘This is the first time we’ve been able to edit the genome efficiently and precisely and at a scale that means individual patient mutations can be corrected.’
