The ABC coverage of Australia's New Year's Eve extravaganzas can't seem to take a trick - panned in 2013 as bland and amateurish, the 2014 version signed off with host Julia Zemiro apparently muttering 'Oh, thank God' as the credits began to roll.

Technical problems interrupted the live broadcast on occasion and, as in the previous year, some jokes were missing their mark.

But it was when the respected comedian said her goodbyes at the end of the telecast, along with her co-hosts, that she made what appeared to be an exasperated comment, seemingly unaware the audio had not yet been turned off.

That's it then. But just seconds after this the comedian was heard to mutter 'Oh thank God' as the credits began to roll, apparently unaware the audio had not been switched off

Even though the audio was stopped from the on-set microphones almost immediately, the 'Oh my God' remark sent social media into a spin.

Some tweeters even suggesting the gaffe was their favourite moment of the coverage.

Others suggesting the time between the early fireworks and the midnight show seemed to drag on longer than the entire year itself. 

Social media launched into action as soon as the audio spill occurred - some suggesting it was the moment of the coverage

Most social media users found Ms Zemiro's slip humorous and came to her defence 

In a boost for the ABC however, the coverage was well-watched. A total national audience approaching 1.9 million viewers was reported, with the capital city audience rating 1.37 million.

Last year's version copped a pasting by critics, some suggesting it had been a 'train wreck', amid other claims it was at times inappropriate and sexist.

This year's show also out-rated the 2013 broadcast.

Tweets about the overall coverage were not very flattering but the ABC coverage did out-rate the previous year's highly controversial show

Definitely not a fan here. But in a boost for ABC bosses, the broadcast did draw a total national audience of almost 1.9 million

Opinions on the hosts and the coverage differed across the board, with most viewers criticising at least one aspect
