Alan Pardew says the decision to tell Jonas Gutierrez to find a new club following his recovery from testicular cancer last year was made on a ‘pure football’ basis.

The Newcastle winger returned to Tyneside last December having had a testicle removed, but was loaned out to Norwich in January after being told he did not feature in the manager’s first-team plans.

Gutierrez has now successfully fought the illness for a second time and will be back in training with United next month.

However, the 31-year-old has this week spoken of his disappointment at events of 12 months ago, indicating he was unhappy with the actions of his manager.

Pardew, though, has defended that decision and is looking forward to welcoming Gutierrez back to the club in the coming weeks.

‘It was a pure football decision, and those are decisions that have to be made,’ he said.

‘We’ve supported him and tried to do what we could when his illness was made known to us, before it was known publicly.

‘What he has done is absolutely marvellous, to recover like he has. I believe he’s picking up an award. We’re very proud of what he has done. He needs to rest assured it was purely a football decision.’

Pardew added: ‘We have been very supportive since the illness and hopefully he will come back all guns blazing. He is a great character and we miss him dearly and look forward to seeing him.

‘His quotes more or less say it was a footballing decision and we have to make these tough decisions. That was one based on football and nothing else.’
