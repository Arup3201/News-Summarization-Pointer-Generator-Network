A high school teacher who engaged in sexually explicit conversations with male students, including asking them for semen-stained tissues to make art projects, has been sentenced to 15 years jail.

Charles Reilly admitted he also instructed the 17 boys, aged 12 to 16, at New Jersey's Pine Hill Middle School how to masturbate over a five year period.

Authorities said the 45-year-old soccer coach, who'd worked at the school for more than a decade, also had an inappropriate online conversation with an undercover cop who he thought was a young boy.

Convicted: Former teacher Charles Reilly, 45, has been sentenced to 15 years behind bars for having sexually explicit conversations with 17 young boys over five years

Courier-Post reported the US Navy veteran was sentenced on Friday and will be eligible for parole in five years.

His attorney, Robert Agre,  said Reilly is open to undergoing psychosexual therapy and had a minimal chance of re-offending.Â 

However during the hearing, parents of the victims depicted Reilly as a predator in their victim impact statements.

'He
 took advantage of his students and their parents by winning our trust,' one mother said in court.

'He was a mentor to my son. He 
manipulated all of us by creating his career and extracurricular 
activities so he could fulfill his disgusting behavior.'

She said her then 14-year-old son was the first victim to come 
forward and had been accused by some people of lying.

Another parent told the court Reilly, an art teacher, was a 'coward'.

Camden
 County Assistant Prosecutor Kelly Testa told the court Reilly displayed a 'jocular and cavalier attitude' when evaluated by a doctor.

'He did not take that serious and until he does, your honor, he is not amenable to treatment,' he said.

Reilly, a former borough councilman, was arrested in March 2011 when his 14-year-old student reported him, philly.com reported.

He was charged last year with 92 counts related to child abuse from 2006 to 2011, according to CBS.

He pleaded guilty to three counts of official misconduct and 17 counts of endangering the welfare of a child and one count of attempted endangering the welfare of a child.

Authorities said that during the investigation, Reilly had a sexually-charged online conversation with an undercover officer posing as a student before asking the officer to delete the graphic content, philly.com reported.

Investigators also said they found child pornography in the American Legion county
 commander's possession, but none was of children he knew.

Reilly told the court he earned $8000 a year as a security guard after being sacked from the school, and lives with relatives.
