Put away: Assif Mayar, shown in this undated mug shot, was arrested after an alligator named Mr Teeth was discovered in his home in Castro Valley,

The caiman, which was 16 years old, 
succumbed to its mysterious illness sometimes overnight, NBC News reported.

The Oakland Zoo
staff would not say what was the animal's cause of death. A necropsy will be performed to shed light on what killed the critter. 

Officers performing a routine 
probation check on a northern California man Wednesday were shocked to 
find that he had some 34lbs of marijuana in his rented house.

But they were more startled to discover the animal guarding it – a five-foot caiman named Mr Teeth.

The Alameda County Sheriff’s deputies arrested Assif Mayar, 32, and took his illegal pet to the Oakland Zoo.

According to KTVU, deputies stopped by Mayar’s two-story rental home in Castro Valley on Wednesday afternoon to perform a probation compliance check.

Alameda County Sgt. J.D. Nelson said yesterday in a news conference that while inspecting the house, officers discovered 34 pounds of dried, processed marijuana in Mayar’s bedroom.

Next to the pot was a two-by-eight-foot Plexiglas tank containing the alligator. Sgt Nelson said that the massive reptile was likely used as a deterrent for would-be marijuana thieves.

The sheriff’s department called in backup from the Fish and Game department, NBC Bay Area reported.

The sergeant said that stumbling upon an alligator was highly unusual. ‘We come across guard dogs like pit bulls quite frequently, but a guard alligator is very unusual,’ he said.

KTVU notes that the married father-of-two has several dogs, including a pit bull, in his rental house.

Mayar purchased Mr Teeth in 1996 to ‘commemorate the death of rapper Tupac Shakur,’ Sgt Nelson said.

Care: Mr Teeth was taken to the veterinary clinic at the Oakland Zoo for treatment because he was ill

Jailed: Mayar was arrested and charged with drug possession charges, and is currently being held at the Santa Rita jail on $160,000 bail

Authorities noted that Mr Teeth, who looked quite sickly and undernourished, was taken to the Oakland Zoo for treatment.

Mayar was arrested and charged with drug possession charges, and is currently being held at the Santa Rita jail on $160,000 bail.

Fish and wildlife officials also cited Mayar with possession of a restricted-species live animal, a misdemeanor that carries a fine of as much as $3,000 and a year in jail.

In the aftermath of Mr Teeth's death, its owner is also facing an animal cruelty charge. 

Margaret Rousser, zoological manager at the Oakland Zoo, told the San Jose Mercury that in the wild, caimans like Mr Teeth live between 20-40 years, and in captivity, their life span could extend to 60 years, provided that they plenty of space and the right environment.  

Castro Valley is located across the San Francisco Bay. There were around 61,400 residents in the area as of the 2010 census.
