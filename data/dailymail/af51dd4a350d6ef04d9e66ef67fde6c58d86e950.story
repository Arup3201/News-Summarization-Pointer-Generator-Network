Students' grades are being inflated as coursework replaces exams at universities across Britain, with some higher education institutions abandoning them entirely.

A study has found that grades are rising as the use of coursework to assess learning increases, sparking fears that students are increasingly downloading essays and plagiarising academic work they find online.

The research, conducted by the Sunday Telegraph using data published by universities, shows that coursework is increasingly replacing traditional exams and many courses in history, English, psychology and media are now 90 to 100 per cent coursework, especially at former polytechnics and new universities.

Learning: University grades are rising, but some academics fear the drop in the use of exams to assess students is driving grades up

The paper reported that exams at many institutions have been reduced to only 20 or 30 per cent of the overall marks and students are allowed to fail papers yet still get their degree.

Critics claimed the figures showed that higher education is 'dumbing down' and claim the trend is behind a spike in first class degrees over the past decade.

Figures show that 53,215 graduates gained firsts in 2010-11 compared with 23,700 in the decade before.

The survey of 85 universities offering Bachelor of Arts degrees in history discovered 60 per cent of assessment is coursework in more than half, while a fifth grade 80 per cent on coursework.

At Worcester University, history degree assessment is entirely done on coursework and in 2011 a total of 20 per cent of all students got a first.

In contrast a tenth of the history degree at the London School of Economics is based on coursework and last year 15 per cent of students there gained first-class degrees.

According to the Telegraph, exams are virtually non-existent in English degrees across the UK, and at Plymouth, Brighton and Derby, there are no traditional exams in the subject.

A report by the research body Higher Education Academy called 'Coursework Marks High, Examination Marks Low: Discuss' found that students on coursework-intensive courses tend to fare better in terms of grades.

A statement from the Academy said: 'It is commonly believed that the standard of student performance in coursework tends to be higher than that achieved in formal examinations.'

Coursework does have its supporters, who claim that coursework is a better way of assessing long-term learning, but some academics say it is fuelling a rise in students plagiarising essays or simply downloading them.

Professor Antonia Payne, head of Worcester University’s institute of humanities, told the Telegraph it dropped traditional exams more than a decade ago.

She added: 'There is no correlation between the cessation of three-hour unseen examinations and the proportion of good history degrees awarded at Worcester over the past decade.'

Professor Alison Wolf, an assessment expert at King’s College, London, and a Department for Education adviser, said she was 'surprised' about the shift.

She said: 'If you use the same assessment technique across a whole degree, you run the risk of only testing a limited number of things.'
