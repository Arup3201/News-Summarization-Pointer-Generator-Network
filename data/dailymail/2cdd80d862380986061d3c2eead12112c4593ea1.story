Hatem Ben Arfa could leave Newcastle before the end of the transfer window with Besiktas ready to end his Tyneside exile.

The French playmaker has been banished to the reserves by Alan Pardew, after the manager questioned his professionalism, and there is no chance of a reprieve.

Turkish side Besiktas have approached United and Ben Arfa could team up with former Newcastle team-mate Demba Ba.

Ben Arfa, who arrived at St James' Park on loan from Marseille in August 2010 before signing a permanent deal the following January, has one year to run on his contract.
