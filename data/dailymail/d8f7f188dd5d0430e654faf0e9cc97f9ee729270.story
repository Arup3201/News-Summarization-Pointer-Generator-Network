'There is some indication that a blunt instrument was used.'

Another neighbour told the publication that she was a 'beautiful' person who had recently moved to the area. 

'She was such a small Brazilian lady and I had never seen them argue so it is a massive shock.' 

Speaking to 7News, neighbour Chris Cunha said the whole community was in shock.

'I feel devastated because I don't know what happened,' she said.

'I'm really worried now.'

Police confirmed that the woman died in hospital on Monday evening
