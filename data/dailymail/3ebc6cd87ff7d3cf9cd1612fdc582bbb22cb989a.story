Bragging: Gregory Curtis, 19, used Twitter to tell his friends what a great time he had at a young offenders’ institution

A teenage attacker served his four-week sentence and then took to Twitter to tell his followers what fun it was.

Gregory Curtis, 19, used the micro-blogging site to tell his friends what a great time he had at a young offenders’ institution.

He breached the conditions of a suspended sentence for a previous offence - an unprovoked drunken attack - and was jailed for common assault.

He tweeted that his time inside was 'one of the funniest months ever'.

Curtis, of Barrow, Cumbria, began a sentence in young offenders institute Lancaster Farms, Lancaster, on August 7.

Now
released, Curtis took to social networking site Twitter this week to 
tell friends about his experiences during his time inside.

'Just got out of her majesty’s mansion hahahahaha too funny,' reads Curtis’ first tweet on release.

'Ye haha (it) was funny as,' Curtis continues.

Although
he tells friends he hated HMP Preston when he had to spend three days 
there, he says of Lancaster Farms: 'I’ve had one of the funniest months 
ever.'

He continues: 'I have too many funny stories, in my pad I could just blast the music channel.'

Curtis also uses his experience to advise a friend facing a possible jail sentence.

Jack
Trelore, of Dalton, is due to be sentenced for his part in an attack 
that left an 18-year-old needing stitches after his lip was ripped 
apart.

Trelore punched his
victim in the face while holding a bunch of keys, opening a gash in his
lower lip requiring more than 20 stitches. He is due to be sentenced on
September 17.

Curtis advises him: 'Lad just be confident and chat to people. It’s a laugh, way easier than I thought it was'.

He adds: 'It (sic) not bad, just boring sometimes.'

On August 7, Curtis sent Trelore a link a story about the attack, saying: 'Ye hahaha ‘brutal attack’.'

Trelore replied: 'What haha carnt (sic) see it.'

He then adds: 'Gunna go buy it me.'

Curtis said he was determined to change his ways after his time inside and give up drinking.

He later said: 'I am on the water now,
I am completely not drinking. It changes me into a completely different
person. Obviously, when you go into prison, you are going to be 
nervous.

'Once you get past that point of thinking everybody is against you... it wasn’t bad, it was just very boring.

Reformed? Curtis has claimed he's determined to change his ways and says he plans to give up drinking

'Sometimes I do use Twitter to show 
off a bit, but deep down I don’t want to go back to prison. I am glad I 
had the experience of it because it is going to make me change my ways.'

Curtis
was given a 42-day sentence, suspended for 12 months, in January 
following an unprovoked assault when he was drunk on December 15.

On
August 7 he was sent to prison after pleading guilty to common assault 
near licensed premises that breached the conditions of his suspended 
sentence.

This activated the sentence and he was imprisoned for 28 days.
