This is the French-owned factory which produced the Findus horse meat lasagnes being sold in UK supermarkets.

Frozen food giant Comigel produces 16,000 tonnes of ready meals in aluminium trays a year at its huge Tavola plant in Capellen, Luxembourg.

Security is said to be extremely tight with high-barbed wire fences surrounding the factory and guards preventing any non-approved visitors from entering.

Imposing: Around 200 staff work at the plant which is surrounding by high barbed wire fencing

One told the Daily Mirror: 'Nobody is welcome in. Our job is to make sure that security is maintained at all times.'

The site employs around 200 people who mould cuts of meat and vegetables into frozen meals which are then sold on to UK supermarkets including Aldi and Tesco.

An insider at the factory told the Daily Mirror: 'There is certainly not a huge amount of difference between the beef lasagne and a chicken pasta bake we produce.

'The factory is all about preparation, freezing and distribution - food can look very similar when it has gone through a professional process like this.'

Comigel produced the Fingus beef lasagnes which were found to be contaminated with 100 per cent horse meat.

Comigel has been run from a headquarters in the north-eastern French town of Metz since 1976.

The company supplies thousands of frozen meals to the UK, Ireland, and all over mainland Europe every year.

A third of the dishes are exported outside France while a quarter go to restaurants in schools, colleges, hospitals, retirement homes and company canteens.

In a statement given to the Daily Mirror Comigel insisted nobody's health has been put at risk by the scandal.

'We have informed the authorities in France and in Luxembourg of the results of our investigation' it added.
