A California teen who fathered a baby with his high school teacher has filed a civil lawsuit against the convicted child molester and the school district where she worked.

The lawsuit filed Wednesday on behalf of the now 18-year-old student alleges that the Redlands Unified School District and Citrus Valley High School were negligent and complicit in the victim’s abuse at the hands of 29-year-old Laura Whitehurst.

‘Children in California, children in Redlands should not be a sex toy for their teacher,’ said one of the boy’s attorneys, John Manly.

Legal battle: The teenage father of former Citrus Valley High teacher Laura Whitehurst's baby, pictured here in court last July, filed a lawsuit claiming negligence

Whitehurst was arrested last July and charged with 41 counts of sex and oral copulation with a minor.

Faced with a 29-year prison sentence, the former AP English teacher pleaded guilty to four counts of unlawful sex with a minor and two counts of oral copulation with a minor in exchange for the dismissal of the other charges against her.

Whitehurst was sentenced to a year in prison in August, but was released last month after serving only six months.

She will remain on probation for five years and must register as a sex offender for life. The plea deal also mandates that Whitehurst undergo counselling. 

The 29-year-old former educator gave birth last June to a daughter fathered by her student, who shares custody with her.

In the 40-page lawsuit unveiled this week, the attorneys for the victim, named John BB Doe in the complaint, claim that Whitehurst's superiors had reason to believe that the woman was sexually abusing her students, but failed to alert their families and police, Courthouse News Service reported.

The suit also alleges that Whitehurst’s colleague, soccer coach Sarah Seevers, knew about her illicit affair with the 16-year-old but kept mum. 

Arrest: Laura Elizabeth Whitehurst, 28, allegedly had sex with three high school students

‘School staff knew Whitehurst was in a
 sexual relationship with the boy and they had a duty to help to protect
 kids,’ said attorney Vince Finaldi.

Redlands
 Unified School District officials said Thursday that the allegations in
 the lawsuit are ‘simply untrue,’ insisting that they contacted police 
in July immediately after hearing about the relationship from the boy’s 
mother. 

However, according
 to a police search warrant, the school district acting on a tip began 
looking into allegations of sexual abuse involving Whitehurst, but did 
not report it to law enforcement due to lack of evidence.

School
 officials did question Whitehurst and the 16-year-old student about the
 allegations, but the two denied any impropriety.

After the woman's arrest, two more former students have come forward to claim they had a sexual relationship with Whitehurst.

According to the civil complaint, the relationship between Whitehurst and the student started in 2012 and lasted about a year.

The
 English teacher began driving the 16-year-old home from functions, 
holding hands with him, and on a trip to Disneyland she told the boy she
 wanted to kiss him.

Soon after, the two began having sex together at the teacher's apartment, often without protection.

When
 Whitehurst found out she was pregnant, she insisted that her underage 
lover accompany her to OB/GYN appointments because she had a ‘high-risk’ 
pregnancy, the lawsuit claims.

Sex offender: Laura Whitehurst, a Redlands 
teacher who had an affair and a baby with a 16-year-old student, pleaded
 guilty to six sex counts in July

Punishment: She agreed to a sentence of one year
 in jail, five years of probation and a lifetime registration as a sex 
offender and sex offender counseling - but she was released last month

Admission: Whitehurst was arrested after the mother of the boy - now 18 - reported their alleged 
year-long relationship and subsequent birth of their child to police

The
 teen said the teacher even called the high school principal to 
excuse his absences so he could go to the doctor with her.

The
 lawsuit recounts how Whitehurst sent her paramour photos of her naked 
body and baby bump with a message, ‘Good night daddy, I love you so 
much.’

The victim, who is 
now 18 years old and attends college, said the woman plied him with 
alcohol and claimed that her pregnancy was a 'miracle' and the product 
of  'divine intervention’ because she had thought she could not 
conceive a child.

On the boy's 17th birthday, Whitehurst gifted him with a Bible and took him to church, he said,

‘Physically, I feel sick to my stomach thinking about the manipulation I was subjected to,’ the young father said in court last summer, according to the Los Angeles Times.

The lawsuit claims the plaintiff suffered psychological and emotional damage, and a financial loss.

‘His life is forever altered,’ Finaldi said, according to Redlands Daily Facts.

The
 teenage victim seeks unspecified punitive damages for negligence, 
fraud, sexual battery, assault, harassment and intentional infliction of
 emotional distress.

In July, Whitehurst told investigators she and the father of her child began having sex at her apartment after a Disneyland trip in 2012.

Another victim was a 14-year-old freshman during the time of their alleged relationship.

'The victim, now 20, told police that he and Whitehurst had sex in her classroom before school, as well as at her apartment and in her car,' a police news release stated.

A third victim to come forward said 
he was 16 when he had sex with Whitehurst when she was his English 
teacher at Redlands High School.

The victim, who identified himself to NBC4 as
 22-year-old Michael Cooper, said the class had been told to write about
 their dreams and afterwards, Whitehurst told him she had dreamed of 
kissing him during a school field trip.

'I didn't have anything to say 
really,' he said. 'I was like, "Oh really, that's crazy," and a couple 
of days later, we ended up actually kissing.'

He
 said that they kissed in her classroom and two weeks later, she invited him to her apartment and 
he spent the night.

They 
continued to have sex a few times a month but he said he never felt as 
if they were in a relationship, but when they contacted each other, they
 both knew what was going to happen, he said.

'When
 it happens, you're kind of like, 
all right, this is pretty badass,' he said. 'You know, my teacher is 
into me. I was 17 and I was having a good time is what it was.

'I didn't feel like a victim; I'm not 
scarred for life or anything. To be honest, I had a 
good time when it was going on.'

'Former flame': Michael Cooper, now 22, said he had sex with the teacher when he was just 16. He said that she told him she had dreamed about kissing him and they later had sex at her home

But
 in spring 2008, he said he stopped returning the teacher's messages and
 calls as he had a girlfriend and had started to feel guilty. They 
eventually broke the relationship off amicably, he said.

He added that he did not get preferential treatment in class because of their relationship.

Cooper
 has filed a police report but told authorities he does not wish to 
press charges. He told NBC4 that he wanted to share his story to 
encourage other victims to come forward.

Whitehurst said that they had a 
relationship 'but not to that extent', Redlands police Detective Natasha
 Crawford said during a phone interview.

Safe space: Whitehurst taught English to sophomores at Citrus Valley high School, where she was also a Link Crew adviser and a Compact Careers Club adviser

'Bad teacher': Whitehurst, left in a yearbook picture, allegedly had sex with three teenage students

The
 mother of the alleged victim, who is now 18, became 
aware of the affair between her son and his teacher and notified the 
Redlands United School District, which in turn contacted police. 

Whitehurst gave birth to a child June 18, and police say her former student is the father.

The educator graduated from Redlands East Valley High School and taught English to sophomores at Citrus Valley, where she was also a Link Crew adviser and a Compact Careers Club adviser.

In 2010, Whitehurst was also an assistant soccer coach. She previously was a volunteer soccer coach for American Youth Soccer Organization in Redlands.

The news blog PE.com reported that Whitehurst's father, Dale Whitehurst, has served as principal of Brywn Mawr Elementary and Moore Middle schools in Redlands.

He also worked as assistant principal at Redlands Easy Valley high School.
