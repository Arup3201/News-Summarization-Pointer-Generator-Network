Reigning Miss Teen USA has told of the terrifying moment she opened an email that featured naked photographs of herself secretly taken via webcam from a hacker at her school.

Cassidy Wolf's interview with Anderson Cooper comes as an international crackdown by the FBI and police in 19 countries has brought more than 90 arrests in what authorities say is a serious strike against 'creepware'.

The sweep, a two-year operation, was coordinated so suspects didn't have time to destroy evidence and included the arrest of  Swedish hacker Alex Yucel, a co-creator of Blackshades, the cheap and accessible software used  to hijack computers remotely.

Wolf, 19, had been watched for one year by former classmate Jared Abrahams, who had installed Blackshades malware on her laptop and was jailed in March for hacking 100-150 women.

Wolf was sent an email containing a series of photos of herself changing, with Abrahams demanding better-quality photos, video and a five-minute sex show on Skype or he would make the images public, threatening to ruin her beauty pageant chances.

'It was traumatizing,' Wolf told CNN.

'It's your bedroom. That's your most private, intimate space and that's where you should feel the most safe.'

Wolf attended school with Abrahams, 19 - who will spend 18 months in jail - in California.

Wolf previously told The Today Show that she 'never had 
any interactions with him. I went to a very big high school but I knew 
of him, I knew of his name, I saw him in the hallways.'

She
 found herself, 'relieved, glad that they were able to find who the 
person is, but on the other hand it was someone I went to high school 
with. He he is young, my age, and I just think it's sad that he chose to
 do this and has now put himself in this big dilemma.'

Wolf said that she has 'mixed emotions' 
surrounding Abrahams's arrest and feels badly for him.

'I
 don’t think he realized the consequences [to the things] that he's 
done. He terrorized me and many other girls for so long.'

Abrahams, who reportedly confessed to 
FBI officials, has now been released on $50,000 bail and remains under 
house arrest under the condition that he not use the Internet.

His
 arrest follows a raid of the Abrahams's home in June when FBI agents 
seized computers, cell phones and hacking software, according to court 
records.

The newly crown Miss Teen USA came forward in August with details of the shocking cyber ordeal.

The college freshman said she was speaking out 
against so-called 'sextortion' in order to spread the word and teach 
other young women to be careful.

'I was terrified,' she said in an August interview with Today.

'I started screaming (when I first got the email), bawling my eyes out. I was on the phone with my 
mom, and I felt helpless because I wasn't sure what to do, so it was a 
very terrifying moment.'

Through an anonymous email address, the cyber stalker attempted to extort Wolf for sexual favors, hence the term 'sextortion.'

'You
 would never think somebody would be watching you in your room and this 
guy had been,' Wolf said. 'The thought of that just gave me nightmares.'

These
were the first details the beauty queen has released on her experience 
since she revealed she was the victim of cyber crime just after she was 
crowned. 

But the incident actually occurred four months before Wolf won her current title.

'It happened to me when I was a normal girl and it can happen to anybody,' she said. 'The message is to tell somebody.'

Wolf immediately called her mom, who reported the incident to police. The FBI quickly took over the case.

The Temecula, California native now travels the country to tell her story and warn other teenagers about cyber-crime.

'The longer it goes on, the worse it will get, so if you can get the word out,' she urged. 'Talk to the authorities.'

'I wasn't aware that somebody was 
watching me [on my webcam],' she said. 'The light [on the camera]
didn't even go on, so I had no idea.'

She would not provide further details of the nature of the photographs, citing the ongoing federal investigation, but told Fox that they captured things you would do 'in the privacy of your own room'.

She added the stranger tried to extort her, saying that the photos would then not be leaked.

'You just need to be so extremely careful with what you do online nowadays because you never know what people can be doing to you online,' she told Fox.

After she was named Miss California, Miss Wolf traveled to schools near her home in Temecula to talk with students about how to protect themselves from cyber-crimes.

During her one-year reign, she hopes to spread her story as a warning to others.

'This next year I'm just so excited to be able to share my story 
and raise awareness in young teens about what can happen,' she said.

She said that people can protect themselves by changing their passwords frequently and deleting browsing history regularly. She also suggested putting a sticker over the webcam when it's not being used.

Wolf, an avid dancer since the age of two, plans on continuing this work even when she begins classes at the New York Film Academy this year.

She said she was 'shocked and overwhelmed' to win the pageant in August after just two years of competing in contests.
