If you had blinked you would quite literally have missed the only goal in Mineros' 1-0 win over Necaxa - because it was a 60-yard screamer after just four seconds.

Straight from kick-off, Mineros laid the ball off to Gustavo Ramirez who smashed a shot from just inside the opposition half towards the Necaxa goal.

The Necaxa goalkeeper was taken completely by surprise as the ball sailed past him and into the net.
