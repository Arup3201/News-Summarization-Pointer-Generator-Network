It's one of the home cook's fiddliest chores. Attempting to deseed a pepper as the little pips ping across work tops and onto the floor is a messy job - and just one rogue seed can leave a bitter taste in the mouth.

But now the chore could be a thing of the past as the world's first seedless pepper has gone on sale.

Marks & Spencer is to be the first retailer to sell the pepper, which has been created as the result of a 15 year project with Melrow salads and seed house Syngenta.

Groundbreaking: Grown in Southern Spain, Israel and the Netherlands, the new seedless Angello¿ baby pepper is a completely new variety that is extra sweet and extra crunchy

Convenient: The pepper has been naturally bred to have no seeds at all

The natural breeding programme - not a trace of GM here - resulted in a completely seed-free fruit that, in a happy coincidence, also has a sweeter taste than any other pepper currently on the market.

The trademarked Angello pepper is not only seedless, but also contains a 25 per cent higher level of brix (commonly used to measure sweetness in fruit and vegetables) than ordinary peppers.

The combination makes the Angello ideal not only for cooking, but for snacking, picnics and children's lunchboxes.

Seed-free and sweet: The new peppers were 15 years in the making and are said to be perfect for snacking and lunchboxes

Zeina Orfali, M&S peppers expert, comments: 'We know that seeds in 
peppers can be a real pain for our customers who want to enjoy them 
straight from the pack or cook speedy suppers with them, so we decided 
to develop the first seedless pepper so our customers can enjoy this 
delicious vegetable on the go – no need to deseed.'

The store's grower, Bernard Sparkes, said it was a pleasure to work with M&S on such special projects. 'It’s really exciting to introduce an 
amazing new variety of vegetable to the high street,' he said.

'Not only does it 
save time, but it tastes delicious, better than any other pepper on the 
high street.

'We hope M&S customers enjoy the pepper as much as we 
have developing it.'

Luciano Fioramonti, Syngenta Business Manager added: 'We hope that we’ll 
be able to convert people who don’t normally like peppers with our 
delicious Angello™, it’s the ultimate healthy convenience food!'

Grown in Southern Spain, Israel and the Netherlands, the new sweet 
seedless Angello™ baby pepper is a completely new variety of pepper, 
that is extra sweet and extra crunchy.

Peppers are an excellent source of vitamin C, and just one pepper contains the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of vitamin C.

M&S seedless Angello™ pepper will be £1.79 per pack (100g) and available from 4th December.
