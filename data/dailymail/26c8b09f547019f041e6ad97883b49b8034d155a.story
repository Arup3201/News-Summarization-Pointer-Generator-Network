It is set to be one of the best summers in history for sun watchers.

Tonight will see the first of three 'supermoons', where the sun appears far bigger and brighter than normal.

July 12th, August 10th, and Sept. 9th will all be supermoons, Nasa said, with August's being 'extra super'.

A supermoon rises over the temple of Poseidon, the ancient Greek god of the seas, in Cape Sounion some 60 km (37 miles) east of Athens June 23, 2013. On Saturday a perigee moon coincides with a full moon creating a super moon when it will pass by the earth at its closest point

The supermoon is not the technical term for the full Moon.

Astronomers call this phenomenon a 'perigee moon,' which describes the full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest point to Earth each year.

Perigee marks the closest point of a body as it orbits around Earth, while apogee marks the farthest point from Earth.

Full Moons vary in size because of the oval shape of the Moon's orbit.

The Moon follows an elliptical path around Earth with one side ('perigee') about 50,000 km closer than the other ('apogee'). 

Full Moons that occur on the perigee side of the Moon's orbit seem extra big and bright.

This coincidence happens three times in 2014. 

On July 12th and Sept 9th the Moon becomes full on the same day as perigee. 

On August 10th it becomes full during the same hour as perigee - arguably making it an extra-super Moon.

However, Geoff Chester of the US Naval Observatory say the phenomenon is not actually that rare - it's just that we normally miss it.

'Generally speaking, full Moons occur near perigee every 13 months and 18 days, so it's not all that unusual,' he says.

'In fact, just last year there were three perigee Moons in a row, but only one was widely reported.'

He believes the 'hanging moon' is likely to be the thing most people remember.

Supermoon over New York: For reasons not fully understood by astronomers or psychologists, low-hanging Moons look unnaturally large when they beam through trees, buildings and other foreground objects.

'The ‘Moon Illusion’  is probably what will make people remember this coming set of Full Moons, more than the actual view of the Moon itself,' he said.

The illusion occurs when the Moon is near the horizon. 

For reasons not fully understood by astronomers or psychologists, low-hanging Moons look unnaturally large when they beam through trees, buildings and other foreground objects.

When the Moon illusion amplifies a perigee Moon, the swollen orb rising in the east at sunset can seem super indeed.

'I guarantee that some folks will think it's the biggest Moon they've ever seen if they catch it rising over a distant horizon, because the media will have told them to pay attention to this particular one,' says Chester.

'There's a part of me that wishes that this 'super-Moon' moniker would just dry up and blow away, like the 'Blood-Moon' that accompanied the most recent lunar eclipse, because it tends to promulgate a lot of mis-information,' admits Chester.

'However, if it gets people out and looking at the night sky and maybe hooks them into astronomy, then it's a good thing.'
