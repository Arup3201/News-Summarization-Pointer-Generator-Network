They're not especially known for their savagery. However, one woman claims she was left bleeding 'like a stuck pig' when she was attacked by a Muscovy duck.

Ingrid Cardozo had to be treated by paramedics after she was 'raked' by the large duck as she took pictures of ibises birds in Sarasota, Florida.

The 78-year-old claimed she had been minding her own business in Arlington Park when the Muscovy appeared out of nowhere.

Traumatic experience: Ingrid Cardozo relives her encounter with an aggressive Muscovy duck

'Bloody mess': Ms Cardozo's leg wounds, which were tended to by paramedics. She claimed she was unable to walk for two days

She told ABC News: 'I wasn't bothering him, I wasn't feeding him, I wasn't doing anything to him. He raked my legs until I was a bloody mess.'

Ms Cardozo dialled 911 on her cell phone and, according to ABC News, she was recorded telling the operator: 'I was attacked by a duck! I am bleeding like a stuck pig on both of my legs.'

Despite treatment from paramedics, Ms Cardozo said the painful wounds meant she was unable to walk for two days and she was forced to seek additional medical advice from her own doctor.

While attacks of this nature are uncommon, male Muscovy ducks are known for being territorial which can result in aggression.

This incident is likely to have happened because of Ms Cardozo's close proximity to the pond, wildlife experts said.

Damen Hurd, from Wildlife Incorporated, added: 'Muscovy's can weigh up to twenty pounds. When they are angry, they will bite and scratch you with their claws.

'They will attack other animals, in addition to humans, who are around their pond.'

Ms Cardozo said she wants to warn others of the risk to prevent further duck attacks, which could result in more serious injuries should a small child be clawed or bitten.

Signs warning of the risks are now being drafted by Sarasota County officials to alert park visitors to the potential aggressive nature of male Muscovy ducks.
