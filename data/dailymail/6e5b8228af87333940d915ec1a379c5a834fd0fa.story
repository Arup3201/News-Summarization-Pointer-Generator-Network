The judge banned the parents from naming their daughter after the popular Nutella spread - and renamed her Ella instead

A French judge banned parents from naming their daughter Nutella - because it is the trademarked name of a chocolate spread - and renamed her Ella instead.

After a newborn baby in Valenciennes was named after the spread, the judge ruled the parents' decision was not in the interest of the child.  

But in the absence of the parents, the judge chose to rename the girl Ella.

'The name ‘Nutella’ given to the child is the trade name of a spread,' the court ruled, according to La Voix Du Nord.

'And it is contrary to the child’s interest to have a name that can only lead to teasing or disparaging thoughts.'

As the parents failed to appear in court on the appointed day in November last year the judge ordered the child, born on September 24, to be renamed Ella. 

And a second family, from Raismes, who named their child Fraise - or Strawberry - were told the name could ‘be the cause of mockery’ that ‘could have a negative impact on the child’.

So they opted to used the name Fraisine, which was popular in the 19th century.

In France, parents are free to choose the names of their children, but the registrar checks the name at the time the birth certificate is registered.

If the chosen name seems contrary to the child's interest, the registrar must notify the prosecutor -who may then enter a family court order to change the name.
