Samsonite is recalling 250,000 suitcases, including some sold through UK online stores, amid concerns about toxic chemicals.

The move follows tests by a consumer group which found traces of a cancer-risk chemical in handles on the luxury bags.

The recall relates to the Tokyo Chic brand, which is part of the American Tourister range.

Recall: Samsonite products are displayed at a store in Hong Kong where the testing on the Tokyo Chic suitcases that has led to the recall was carried out

In Britain these cases are advertised
 by specialist online firms such as bagsdirect.com and luggagehut.co.uk,
 rather than high street outlets.

Bagsdirect.com was selling a Tokyo 
Chic expandable upright trolley case in black pearl print at £64.99 on 
its  website yesterday.

A spokesman for the firm said Samsonite generally dispatches these and other designs from a large warehouse  in Belgium.

Samsonite, a US company, pulled the line from Hong Kong stores earlier this week to replace the side handles.

Concern: Testing in Hong Kong, a popular shopping destination, detected the high level of cancer linked compounds

The move came after Hong Kong’s  
Consumer Council reported that a  sample it tested had levels of poly- 
cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that  were higher than recommended in 
voluntary guidelines.

The compounds are commonly found in 
plastics, rubber and lubricating oil and it is possible that traces were
 left during manufacturing, the council said.

They have been known to cause cancer 
and birth defects in animals. The council’s tests gave readings for the 
compounds that were off the charts at 17,960 milligrams per kilo.

Samsonite commissioned independent 
tests from German and Hong Kong  laboratories that showed levels were  
‘significantly lower’ than the council’s findings. Those tests found 17 
milligrams per kilo of the compound, said Ramesh Tainwala, Samsonite’s 
Asia-Pacific and Middle East president.

He said: ‘A human being has to eat  100 handles and then you have the probability of one in a billion chance of getting cancer.’

The Tokyo Chic suitcases are sold 
mainly in Asia. Samsonite expects to spend £320,000 on the recall, which
 involves 250,000 suitcases sold over the past three years.

The company said it will take about a week to replace the handles on 30,000 cases still in stock.

In Hong Kong, about 800 people have 
contacted the company about the suitcases and about 240 have asked for 
the handles on their bags to be replaced, Mr Tainwala said.

Samsonite said there are no legal  
guidelines for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The council used 
guidelines  set under a voluntary German scheme for its tests.

British consumers who own a Tokyo Chic suitcase are being told that they should contact the retailer it came from for advice.
