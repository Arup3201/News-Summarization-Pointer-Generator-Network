It is cheaper and more effective for GPs to send overweight patients to diet programmes such as Weight Watchers than treat them on the NHS, according to new research.

Offering patients one-to-one counselling in diet and fitness via GP surgeries or pharmacies is 'ineffective', as are programmes run by NHS food advisers and dieticians.

Experts from Birmingham University said the money would be better spent paying for patients to attend classes run by commercial companies.

Big benefits: Losing just 7lb could gain you an extra year of life, according to research at Birmingham University

They said the benefits include cutting the risk of diabetes and boosting life expectancy. They found people who lose just 7lbs could gain an extra year of life, but the weight loss would have to be sustained forever.

The study of 740 British slimmers found that those who went to a commercial slimming group for three months lost up to three times as much weight as those who were given diet advice by their family doctor.

Researchers speculated that this could be because group sessions provided a greater morale-boost and that the diet leaders had often gone through losing weight themselves.

Study leader Dr Kate Jolly said commercial sessions, paid for by the NHS, were also significantly cheaper, 
with a course of 12 one-hour group sessions costing around £55 – just 
slightly more than one 12-minute GP appointment.

The average weight loss was best for those attending Weight Watchers sessions – they lost almost 10lbs  (4.4kg) on average in a year – and worst for those following advice from a pharmacy, who lost only 2.6lbs (1.2kg).

Dr
Jolly said the NHS-funded study analysed the effect on life expectancy 
of weight loss of around 7lbs  (3.5kg) in a 14-stone 49-year-old –
the average age of people taking part in the study.

She added: ‘It shows that losing a fairly modest amount of weight is worthwhile, although the big challenge is maintaining the weight loss. Many studies show that people tend to put it on again after a short period of time.’

In
the study, published in the British Medical Journal, the obese and 
overweight participants were asked by their GPs to join several 
commercial weight loss programmes, or have counselling from GPs or 
pharmacists over 12 weeks.

Another
group was given free vouchers for a local fitness centre.

After one 
year, all those attending commercial sessions had lost significant 
amounts of weight, while counselling made little difference.

Almost a third of people allocated to the Weight Watchers group achieved a five per cent drop in body weight – the level needed to cut the risk of developing diabetes.

Attendance seemed to be the key factor, with people going more often to commercial sessions.

Dr Jolly said: ‘GPs don’t have the tools for helping patients lose weight consistently, but they were the reason these patients were nudged towards losing weight in the first place.’

Almost a quarter of adults in England are now classified as obese and around two-thirds of Primary Care Trusts in England and Wales already pay for patients to attend Weight Watchers courses.
