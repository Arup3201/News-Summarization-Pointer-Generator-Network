A group of soldiers who served with Sgt Bowe Bergdahl all agreed that he was a deserter, before angrily spelling out how they would have 'died for someone who then simply left'.

Sgt Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban in Afghanistan in June 2009.

He was freed in exchange for five Taliban mujahideen being held in Guantanamo Bay.

In June the six soldiers appeared on Fox News and all raised their hands when asked if they thought he was a deserter

The six say they are angered by White House attempts to paint Bergdahl as a 'war hero', such as when his parents appeared with Obama in the White House Rose Garden

But six soldiers interviewed on Fox News all raised their hands when asked if they thought he was a deserter.

One, Cody Full, said: ‘[Bergdahl] did not serve with distinction. That’s a spit in the face to everyone who joined the Army and anyone who died looking for him.’

He added: ‘Here is the thing. When you’re in combat doesn’t matter, left, right, Independent, Jedi, whatever you want to be. He’s my brother, he’s my brother, he’s my brother. We’ll all ride together, we’ll all die together. I don’t know how he felt about us but we would all die for him and he left.’

The soldiers are demanding that Bergdahl tells his side of the story, saying that he owes it to them and the American people.

Team leader Evan Buetow said Bergdahl had asked him a number of questions a short time before his disappearance that, in retrospect, make it apparent that Bergdahl had been planning to leave.

Bergdahl asked him, for example, how much of a cash advance he could get and how to go about mailing home his personal computer and other belongings. He also asked what would happen if his weapon and other sensitive items such as night vision goggles went missing. He said he told Bergdahl that, as any soldier would know, that would be 'a big deal'.

'At the time ... it wasn't really alarming' to hear Bergdahl ask about those things, Buetow said. 'Yes, it was a kind of off-the-wall question,' but the notion of a fellow soldier running off during the night seemed so far-fetched as to not be possible, he said.

Buetow said that crucial missions were cancelled while the platoon searched for him.

He said he feels strongly that Bergdahl should face trial for desertion, but he said it is less clear that he should be blamed for the deaths of all soldiers killed during months of trying to find him.

He said he knows of at least one death on an intelligence-directed infantry patrol to a village in search of Bergdahl. More broadly, the mission of his entire unit changed after Bergdahl's disappearance because it began to incorporate efforts to pursue clues to his whereabouts.

'Those soldiers who died on those missions, they would not have been where they were ... if Bergdahl had never walked away,' he said. 'At the same time I do believe it is somewhat unfair for people to say, "It is Bergdahl's fault that these people are dead." I think that's a little harsh.'

The exchange has become a toxic issue for President Barack Obama with Republicans saying the swap is 'putting a price' on American soldiers and will lead to more kidnappings.

Sgt Bergdahl, who is now aged 28, is being treated at a US military hospital in Germany before he flies back home to a growing row and many unanswered questions about what actually happened to him.

On Monday, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon said that he planned to hold hearings on the matter and get to the bottom of what happened.

He added that he felt the President ‘broke the law’ because he did not consult Congress about the release of inmates of Guantanamo Bay, as he is obliged to do so under the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act.

Republican Senator Ted Cruz, Texas, also said: ‘Now we make deals with terrorists. And the question going forward is, have we just put a price on other US soldiers?

‘What does this tell terrorists, that if you capture a US soldier, you can trade that soldier for five terrorists we’ve gone after?’
