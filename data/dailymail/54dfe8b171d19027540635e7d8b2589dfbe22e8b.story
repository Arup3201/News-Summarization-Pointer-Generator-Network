A 'controlling' bigamist has been jailed for life for murdering his wife and hiding her body in the boot of a car. 

Pierre Legris killed his wife, Rui Li, by hitting her over the head at the home they shared in Bournemouth, Dorset, before driving her body to the garage owned by his other wife, Irene Smith.

Ms Li's body was later driven to a nearby road by Legris' son, Jonathan, where it was found by police in the boot of the abandoned car a week later.

Legris, also known as Alain Baron, will serve a minimum of 25 years in prison after being found guilty of murder at Winchester Crown Court today. 

The trial heard that Legris was believed to have killed Ms Li to benefit from her life insurance policy worth £300,000 to help pay off the 'desperate' financial debts of the three defendants.

The couple also ran a massage company from their home which provided 'sexual services' and that Pierre Legris would sometimes join in, the court was told.

The couple were also involved in local swinging networks, it was said. 

Legri struck 44-year-old Li, a Chinese national, at their home before wrapping her in a building sheet while she was still alive, the court was told.

He said: 'No such heavy weapon has been found and in addition very little blood was found at the scene - it suggests a thorough clean-up has been done to prevent blood from escaping to the scene nearby.'

Mr Lickley said that Pierre Legris had bought several bags of cement and added: 'It may be there was a plan to bury Rui Li under the floor of that property. 

He said that Ms Li's body was then placed in Legris' Ford Transit van which the following day was taken to Cromer Motors, owned by 66-year-old Smith.

There, Jonathan Legris replaced the starter motor while Ms Li's body lay in the back of the van.  

Mr Lickley added that the body was later moved to a Fiat Punto, owned by Jonathan Legris, which he abandoned in a nearby road. Her body was found a week later. 

The prosecutor said that following the killing, Pierre Legris was 'cool and focused and clear in what he was doing'.

He added: 'He rushed or in a panic, he had a plan and it involved others, his son, Jonathan Legris and his other wife Irene Smith'.

Legris reported Li missing the following week after colleagues at Poole Hospital began to make inquiries to her whereabouts. 

Her daughter from a previous marriage, Lu Yao, 18, had also begun asking questions about her mother. 

Legris denied murder but admitted perverting the course of justice. He told the court that he only moved her body after finding her dead in their home.

He said he had tried to hide his wife's body because he was worried that their unconventional sex life would be made public.

The judge, Mr Justice Dingemans, said that as well as a financial motive, Pierre Legris might have murdered Ms Li because of her decision to adopt a child. 

He said: 'It may equally have been the fact that Pierre Legris, as a controlling person, was not prepared to deal with the apparently late decision that Ms Li had made to adopt a child from China which would have compromised his way of living.'

Jailing Pierre Legris, Judge Dingemans said: 'I am sure the murder of Ms Li was planned with great care and the murder weapon must have been placed for Pierre Legris to render Ms Li unconscious and without any noise. There was a clear intention to kill.'

Before the start of the trial, Legris pleaded guilty to an offence of bigamy by marrying Ms Li in 2007 while having been married to Irene Smith since 1987. 

Legris was sentenced to three years imprisonment to run concurrently for the bigamy offence, with no separate penalty for perverting the course of justice.

His son, Jonathan Legris, a former racing car driver was convicted of assisting an offender by driving the Fiat Punto with Ms Li's body inside. He was jailed for two years.

The judge said: 'He was prepared to do anything for his father, that is obvious. My view is I still have not heard the full truth of what his father told him.'

Smith,was found guilty of perverting the course of justice by providing a false alibi to her husband, and she was also convicted of assisting an offender by hiring a storage facility to hide her husband's clothes and French passport. 

She was jailed for three years on each offence to run concurrently.

Jonathan Legris and Smith were both cleared of a charge of conspiracy to murder.
