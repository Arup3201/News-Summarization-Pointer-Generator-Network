He should have been enjoying the sweet smell of success.

But instead Ed Miliband's local elections triumph turned sour today as he was pelted - with an egg.

The Labour leader was on a victory walkabout in Southampton after racking up 776 new council seats - almost 100 more than expected - across the country.

But the vote predictions weren't the only thing that was smashed when the large chicken egg cracked on the leader's shoulder.

Watch out, Ed! A protester cracks an  egg the Labour leader's shoulder during a victory walkabout in Southampton this afternoon

It left a runny yellow mess down Mr Miliband's grey suit as his team scrambled to catch the culprit.

The politician was giving a TV interview when the man in a hat pushed through the throng and slapped the egg on Mr Miliband's shoulder.

The egg broke left a yellow mess dripping down Mr Miliband's jacket, which he quickly removed and gave to an aide as the man fled down the street.

Mr Miliband finished the interview in just a shirt and tie, made an exit and went back to his car.

The scene was similar to when Labour's former deputy PM John  Prescott was hit with an egg thrown by a protester in 2011 in Rhyl, north Wales.

Lord Prescott responded with two quick punches to the man's face - and earned himself the nickname 'two jabs'.

Mr Miliband's response was not quite as aggressive.

After being hit and removing his dirtied jacket, Mr Miliband joked that the man was 'obviously not one of my fans'.

The butt of all the yolks: Mr Miliband must have felt that finally things were going well for him after a troubled start to his leadership, but his success is overshadowed by the egg attack

He later Tweeted: 'For those 
wondering about egg's origins, fairly sure it wasn't free range but 
nothing can take away from cracking result in Southampton...'

The fracas was just one of several ugly scenes and marred a jubilant day for Labour in which they took control of 32 councils.

The first spats of violence began yesterday in Tower Hamlets when police at a polling station had to call reinforcements after a candidate alleged that he had been threatened by activists from rival parties.

Chris Smith, standing for the Greens in the London Assembly elections, claimed that one activist threatened to 'punch his lights out' when he complained about the crowd handing out Respect and Labour leaflets outside St Matthias Primary, off Brick Lane.

Officers spent the rest of the day guarding polling stations across the borrough after the Met launched a formal investigation into allegations of electoral fraud in the borough. Police were called in after reports of voter intimidation outside polling stations at previous elections.

It was feared that activists were 'harassing' potential voters.

The drama was followed by a fracas in Bradford between Respect Party followers and supporters of Labour, still angry about the humiliating by-election defeat inflicted on them by MP George Galloway.

In yet more ugly election scenes, police were forced to break up a late-night election count dsipute in St Helens.

A row broke out as Liberal Democrats in the Labour-controlled constituency suffered a series of setbacks, leading to disappointment for the party's leader on the council, Brian Spencer who lost his seat.

According to witnesses at St Helen's Town Hall there was a confrontation between Mr Spencer and Labour candidate Mark Johnson, who fell across a table and landed on his mother.

Labour councillor Andy Bowden said: 'As the results were coming in it was becoming clear the Lib Dems had lost quite a few seats.'

He added: 'There were quite a lot of police in the room and at least two interjected and separated everyone.'

Mr Bowden said Mr Johnson may have twisted his ankle and was giving a statement to police.

It is understood police officers intervened, but no arrests were made.

Lib Dem councillor Michael Haw said Mr Spencer, the council's ex-opposition leader, was upset at losing his seat.

Another  row broke out late last night after Conservative Party co-chairwoman Baroness Sayeeda Warsi linked the rise of the UK Independence Party (Ukip) with the decline of the far-right British National Party.

UKIP were tipped to do well as the results poured in this morning, with the BNP falling further behind.

But Lady Warsi appeared to suggest the number of candidates fielded by the eurosceptics had risen in line with a fall in the number standing for the BNP - a link with provoked Ukip's spokesman to brand her 'a bitch'.

Speaking on the BBC's election night coverage, Lady Warsi said: 'Where Ukip is fielding candidates this time that the BNP did last time but they're not this time, I think that will have an impact.'

She added: 'There are members of Ukip who are from all sorts of political parties, but it is an interesting mix there in terms of the number of candidates.'

UKIP spokesman Gawain Towler vented his anger at Lady Warsi's comments on Twitter, calling her a 'bitch' to his 1,700 followers, some of whom criticised his 'unparliamentary language'.

The spokesman quickly deleted the post and and apologised, tweeting: 'Deleted, out of order on my part'.

He later added: 'Shouln't (sic) have said that, apologise.'
