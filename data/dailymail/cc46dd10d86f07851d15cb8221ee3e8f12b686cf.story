Murdered: Deborah Levey was found by a colleague at her home in Chichester

A woman suspected of being murdered in her idyllic cottage was a prolific user of dating websites, it has emerged.

The body of Debbie Levey, 44, was found slumped in front of the TV by a colleague who called in to give her a lift to work.

Police originally believed the divorcee died of natural causes – she had had cancer surgery and was off work until last week.

But detectives launched a murder inquiry after uncovering evidence of foul play.

A 45-year-old man, believed to be her on-off boyfriend, has been released on bail after being questioned by police on suspicion of murder.

Mrs Levey lived with her 16-year-old daughter Jade in £300,000 Cherry Tree Cottage in East Ashling, near Chichester, in the South Downs National Park.

The man, from Selsey, West Sussex, was arrested on Monday morning on suspicion of murder and released on conditional police bail until February 21 later the same evening while inquiries continue.

Murder squad detectives are working to untangle the complex personal life of the popular twice-married mother and care home manager.

Mrs Levey was a regular user of dating websites and friends said she had been in several relationships over the past year.

A keen horse rider, she posted online photographs of herself out with friends and answered personal questions in an anonymous singles forum.

But it is believed she also met men, including the suspect in custody, who lives in nearby Selsey, through her extensive network of friends.

Mrs Levey was discovered dead shortly before 8am on Monday at her semi-detached home of ten years on a quiet country lane.

She had suffered no obvious injuries and friends told police the last time she was seen alive was around lunchtime on Sunday.

Detective Chief Inspector Ian Pollard,
of the Surrey and Sussex major crime team, said officers became 
‘increasingly suspicious’ after being called in by paramedics.

‘As yet, the cause of her death is 
unexplained and we are awaiting the results of a post-mortem 
examination,’ he said. ‘Our inquiries lead us to believe that this was 
not a natural death and a murder inquiry has been launched.’

Eric Bulbeck, a 77-year-old farmer who
owns the cottage, said Mrs Levey was found by a colleague who let 
herself in through an unlocked door.

‘Debbie’s manager came round to pick her up, they were going to London for a meeting,’ he added.

‘She waited outside the house then 
phoned her but got no response. She went round the back and the door was
unlocked and that was when she saw her.

‘She came back here and I had to go in to confirm it. She was just sitting on the settee with a rug around her shoulders.

‘The television was on the standby 
screen as if it had been on. It was horrifying – she has been a friend 
for a long time and my wife is friendly with her.’  Mr Bulbeck said his 
tenant had been seeing a man who worked as a taxi driver in Selsey, near
Chichester.

He added that Mrs Levey was a ‘good friend, a brilliant tenant and a lovely lady’ who was known for being excellent at her job.

Police want to trace anyone who saw a 
blue Vauxhall Vectra parked in a small lay-by on the opposite side of 
the road to her home. Mrs Levey lived alone after splitting from her 
second husband, Gareth Allen, 44, who lives in Selsey with his second 
wife Sharron.

Louise Chater, her former 
sister-in-law, said the couple remained on good terms and continued to 
share the responsibility of bringing up Jade, a college student.

She added: ‘Debbie was a kind and beautiful person. She was a proud mother and had brought up a beautiful daughter.’

Mrs Levey worked as a manager at the Leaholme care home and assisted living accommodation for elderly people in Chichester.

A former colleague said she seemed to be ‘upbeat’ about returning to work.

He said: ‘In recent months she had 
been dating a few guys, her status on Facebook had gone from being in a 
relationship to single on a number of occasions.’

Another friend said Mrs Levey was diagnosed with cervical cancer last year and had a hysterectomy just before Christmas.
