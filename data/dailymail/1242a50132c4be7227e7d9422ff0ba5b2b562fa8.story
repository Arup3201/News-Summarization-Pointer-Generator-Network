A callous car clamper called an ambulance to help a motorist he had targeted - before continuing to clamp his vehicle after the man was rushed to hospital.

Paul Wiseman had pulled over in a no-parking zone in Skipton, North Yorkshire, when he began feeling unwell, only to be targeted by one of Britain's most notorious clamping firms, Carstoppers Ltd, as soon as he stopped.

The father-of-two tried to stop clamper Gareth Evans from seizing his vehicle but slumped against his Mercedes van while struggling for breath due to an extremely high blood pressure.

Illness: Paul Wiseman was clamped despite nearly collapsing due to high blood pressure next to his van in Skipton, North Yorkshire

Mr Wiseman said the clamper paused briefly to call an ambulance, but then continued to clamp the van as he was rushed from the scene with blue lights earlier this month.

He has since claimed that the manner in which Carstoppers 'took advantage' of his illness to clamp his car was 'despicable'.

Mr Wiseman, 55, said: 'I didn’t realise it was the back of a business premises, I just needed to stop because I didn’t feel right.

'While I was waiting I saw this car come hurtling up to me and pull in front.

'This man rushed towards me carrying the yellow clamp and I got out to ask him what he was doing.

'I stood in front so he couldn’t do it. He was trying to get me out of the way so I pushed him backwards.

'I felt unwell, exhausted and was struggling to get my breath. And when I turned towards the van door I collapsed onto the floor of the van.

'He got out his phone and rang for an ambulance, but even though he could see I was unwell, he started to clamp my car.

Mr Wiseman described the treatment he received from Carstoppers Ltd and clamper Gareth Evans (right) as 'despicable'

'I wasn’t in any fit state to control what was going on and to take advantage of someone in my position is despicable.

'I’m furious about it now but at the time I was more concerned about what was wrong with me.'

Mr Wiseman, who runs his own cutting tool distribution business, is still awaiting the results of hospital tests to establish what caused his high blood pressure.

He said his son Chris was confronted by Mr Evans, who handed him a ticket that said he had to pay £150 to release the clamp.

'Obviously Chris was worried about me and wanted to come with me to hospital so there was no point in arguing,' said Mr Wiseman.  

'He had no choice but to go to the nearest cash machine, draw out the money and hand it over.'

Mr Wiseman, dad to Chris, 23, and Gemma, 28, was in hospital until around 5pm as his blood pressure 'had shot up'.

Mr Wiseman said he is boycotting businesses that use the firm, adding: 'Their approach is very aggressive and their actions could lead to somebody becoming seriously ill.

'There are much better ways for businesses to prevent parking without resorting to car clampers. '

A Carstoppers spokesman said the incident, like all others, was recorded on video and he was confident the clamping was carried out within the law.

He stressed there were signs explaining clampers were operating.

The spokesman said:  'Businesses in Skipton were sick to death of people using their parking areas for free.

'People have commented that parking fees are too high in Skipton. People choose to chance it and not pay. '
