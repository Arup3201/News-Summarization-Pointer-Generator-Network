The army private convicted as Bradley Manning for releasing US diplomatic and military secrets to Wikileaks has officially petitioned a Kansas court for a name change to Chelsea Elizabeth Manning.

Manning who announced last August that she identifies as a woman and wants to be called Chelsea has a hearing scheduled at Fort Leavenworth, where Manning is serving his 35-year sentence.

The news was announced on Wednesday by the Private Manning Support Network, which also said it is changing its name to the Chelsea Manning Support Network.

Name change: Chelsea Manning, who was tried and convicted for leaking U.S. secrets to WikiLeaks, is petitioning a Kansas court for an official name change, to Chelsea Elizabeth Manning

Officials at Fort Leavenworth have said Manning would have to get a legal name change to be known as Chelsea.

Media has referred to Manning as Chelsea since shortly after she announced in August her desire to be known by that name and treated as a woman.

Manning has been diagnosed by at least two Army behavioral health specialists with gender dysphoria, or gender identity disorder.

In addition to the name change, Manning has asked to receive hormone replacement therapy and live as a woman while incarcerated.

She and Coombs have said they will go to court, if necessary, to obtain the hormone treatment.

Civilian federal prisons are required to provide such treatment, if deemed medically necessary, for inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria.

Unlike in military prisons, the policy also allows inmates who believe they are the wrong gender to dress and live accordingly as part of their individual treatment plans.

The military has said it does not provide treatment for gender dysphoria because Pentagon policy dictates that transgender soldiers are not allowed to serve.

But Manning can't be discharged until she's released from prison and exhausts appeals of her criminal convictions.

The former intelligence analyst was sentenced in August to 35 years for leaking battlefield video and hundreds of thousands of classified Iraq and Afghanistan war logs and State Department diplomatic cables while serving in Iraq.
