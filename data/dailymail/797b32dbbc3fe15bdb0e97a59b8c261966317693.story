A New Jersey poll has revealed most New Jersey residents think Chris Christie is lying about Bridgegate and should quit.

The poll, conducted on 800 likely voters Thursday night after Governor Christie’s press conference by Rasmussen Reports, is the first since his apology after the scandal was made public.

It found that 54 per cent of the Garden State’s residents think he knew what was going on.

Governor Christie, who was tipped to run for President in 2016, could be impeached if he is found to have been involved

And 56 per cent said he should resign if it is proven that he approved of the tactic to retaliate against the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, who refused to endorse Christie’s re-election, according to the poll released by the New York Post.

Only 36 per cent believe Christie’s claim that he was unaware that a top aide orchestrated the politically motivated closing of George Washington Bridge access lanes, the survey showed.

The voters’ opinions were particularly divided into their political affiliation.

Only 34 per cent of Republicans and 46 per cent of unaffiliated voters believed Christie was lying — while 75 per cent of Democrats were convinced he wasn’t telling the truth.

However, most voters still think the governor is doing a better job than President Barack Obama.

According to the survey, they gave Christie a 60 per cent approval rating, compared to 52 per cent for Obama.

Most people believe his ethical standards are on the same level as other politicians, at 39 per cent.

But 33 per cent still believed he is more ethical than most politicians, while 21 per cent said he is less ethical.

The
 survey also found that 71 per cent suspect that other political figures
 who failed to back Christie had been targeted by the governor’s staff, according to the poll published by the New York Post.

And
 47 per cent believed that members of Christie’s staff who ordered the 
closing should be criminally prosecuted, while 31 per cent said they 
should not.

A poll taken
 by Quinnipiac University immediately before the bridge scandal found 
Christie — a leading contender for the White House in 2016 — was the 
‘hottest’ politician in the country when it came to ‘warmth’ and 
favorability, according to the Post.

On Friday it was revealed that aides to Christie 
knew traffic closures they spitefully ordered on the George Washington 
Bridge were putting lives at risk after just a few hours – but carried 
on snarling traffic for another four days.

A
 huge dump of documents showed the Republican-orchestrated political 
revenge stunt that threatens the White House ambitions of the New Jersey
 governor continued for an entire work week with little regard for 
public safety.

In a lengthy press briefing on Thursday, 
the defiant governor forcefully denied any involvement.

A port authority employee warned  the bridge lane closures created safety risks, but they continued for four days
