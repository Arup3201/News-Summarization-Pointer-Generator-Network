Secretary of State John Kerry says he has no intentions to apologize to France today for the absence of high-profile U.S. officials at last Sunday's unity rally.

The Obama administration official said he does plan, however, to 'share a big hug with Paris.'

Kerry tacked a visit to France onto an already scheduled trip to Europe after the executive branch was ridiculed for not having a visible representative at Sunday's march.

The White House admitted on Monday that it erred in judgement, but Kerry and his staff have steadfastly argued that criticism is unwarranted.

No hard feelings: Speaking to reporters in Bulgaria, Secretary of State John Kerry said he plans to 'share a big hug with Paris' when he arrives there today

Both sets of diplomats were in Sofia, Bulgaria for their respective meetings with government leaders

At a news conference on Monday in India Kerry contended that U.S. officials had been 'deeply engaged' with French authorities since the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack and characterized sideswiping at the Obama administration as 'sort of quibbling a little bit.'

'Our Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was there and marched, our ambassador was there and marched, many people from the embassy were there and marched,' Kerry stated.

Kerry said he 'very much wanted to have been there but couldn't do so because of the commitment that I had here and it is important to keep these kinds of commitments.' 

Attorney General Eric Holder was in Paris on the day of event attending a terrorism summit, but he did participate in the march for reasons that are still unknown. 

Senior Advisor to the President Valerie Jarrett shed little additional light on the snafu during a Thursday appearance on CNN's New Day.

'Certainly we would have liked to have participated in the parade,' Jarrett said, according to the Washington Times.

'I’d remind you that Attorney General Holder was in Paris for a very important meeting together with his colleagues from around Europe and around the world to take a look at what we [can] do to make sure that we’re cooperating, and so I think we certainly got the substance right,' she said.

'But it would have been great to participate in the parade, and we’re delighted that Secretary Kerry is there now.'

The White House confessed on Monday 'that somebody with a higher profile should have been asked to attend' but the president's spokesman would not say who at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue made the call or why Holder wasn't ordered to make an appearance.

Across town, a spokeswoman for Kerry, Marie Harf, was telling reporters that she didn't think condemnation of the administration was 'fair' at all.

'There are more ways than just this march to show our solidarity,' she said. The people of France 'know we have stood by them.' 

France's ambassador to the U.S. Gerard Araud indicated on Monday that his country was not offended by U.S. cabinet officials nonattendance at the Paris rally.

'I am extremely grateful for the overwhelming support France has received from everybody here, from the President to the ordinary American,' he tweeted.

Kerry said this morning that he would 'share a big hug with Paris and express the affection of the American people for France and for our friends there who have been through a terrible time' during his afternoon drop-in.

'I don't feel any other exigencies, other than continuation of our friendship and our responsibilities as good friends and the longest ally in our history, and that's why I am going,' Kerry said during a news conference in Sofia, Bulgaria, per the Associated Press.
