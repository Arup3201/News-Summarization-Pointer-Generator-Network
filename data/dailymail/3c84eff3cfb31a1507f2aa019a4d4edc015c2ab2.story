A Muslim community spokesman has received more chilling threats, this time from a Twitter account linked to Australian jihadist Mohamed Elomar, who is thought to be currently waging jihad in Syria and recently posed with two decapitated heads.

Keysar Trad, who heads the Islamic Friendship Association, was warned in the message about him having contacted the Australian Federal Police. The person who sent him the post also said they knew where Mr Trad lived.

Target of threats: Prominent Muslim community spokesman Keysar Trad revealed that he had received a series of chilling threats. Mr Trad often speaks for the Islamic community in front of the media.

'Didn't you know I already have your full details,' started the disturbing message Mr Trad received five days after he had reported an earlier threat to the Australian Federal Police. 

'Why would you put urself and family at risk calling AFP u Apostate.

'Wrong move.'

Earlier, Mr Trad had received a threat which read: 'Don't u know the penalty for the muslim who aids thr kuffar (infidels) against his muslim brothers, stop hindering men from Allah's path.'

The account also suggested Mr Trad had two wives, which he does not, and insisted he stop assisting the 'kuffar'. The AFP was approached for comment.

Mr Trad told Daily Mail Australia 'email threats' would not deter him from speaking up about his religion.

Mr Trad, who used to work for Sheikh Taj el-Din al-Hilali, has urged Muslims not to go to Syria to fight at his regular Friday sermons at the mosque in Sydney.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who discussed his new terror laws with Mr Trad this week, told reporters on Thursday that ISIS beheadings like that of American journalist James Foley could happen here in Australia.

Latest horror: Propaganda images emerged yesterday of American journalist James Foley being brutally executed by a jihadist with an East London accent. Another journalist, reporter Steven Joel Sotloff, is also in the hands of ISIS.

After the release of a horrific video featuring the murder of an American journalist, Mr Abbott said countries like Australia must remain vigilant to the threat of terrorism.

'It just goes to show that this is not just something that happens elsewhere,' Mr Abbott said.

'It could happen in countries like Australia if we relax our vigilance against terrorism and potential terrorism here on our shores.'

Social media accounts linked to Elomar and Khaled Sharrouf posted disturbing pictures of beheaded bodies in late June and in early August.

Sharrouf's seven-year-old son was also pictured gripping a decapitated head in the city of Raqqa, Syria. The abhorrent post made headlines around the world and was condemned by US Secretary of State John Kerry.

Khaled Sharrouf's unidentified son was pictured lifting up a severed head earlier this month.

Sharrouf, from south-western Sydney, famously slipped out of Australia on his brother's passport in December 2013 in what was considered a major security breach. His wife Tara Nettleton and their children also left the country at a later date.

Mr Trad is not the only Australian community leader to receive threats from ISIS militants.

Dr Jamal Rifi, an Islamic leader who has been critical of the actions of Elomar and Sharrouf, also received death threats from an Abu Hafs account last week after he publicly condemned their actions.

That social media account was suspended immediately after Daily Mail Australia revealed the threat.

You've probably seen him on TV or heard him on the radio.

But the prominent Islamic community spokesman Keysar Trad has been the target of scathing criticism from outspoken commentators who say he doesn't really represent the Muslim community.

Critics including News Corp columnist Andrew Bolt point out the Islamic Friendship Association he appears in the media as a spokesman for only has 12 members.

In Thursday's Daily Telegraph newspaper, News Corp columnist Andrew Bolt questioned Prime Minister Tony Abbott's decision to invite Mr Trad to a meeting with Islamic leaders this week.

To that claim, Mr Trad said the IFA is a think tank that works with 'other community groups'.

He said he spends much of his time volunteering with the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils, an umbrella organisation of the country's Islamic groups as an executive board member.

Mr Trad said he chooses to speak out because few Muslims wanted to talk with the media.  'I'm already out there on the front line. I'm already a big target, I've got the scars to prove it.'

South Australian Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi, one of Mr Trad's most vocal critics, branded him an 'apologist' for Islamic extremists.

Mr Bernardi told Daily Mail Australia: 'Many of Mr Trad's views are not compatible with the values and social mores that have built our nation and that underpin Western civilisation...'

'As I am an optimist by nature I choose to believe that someone of Mr Trad's character and history is not representative of Australian Muslims.

'If he is we should all be very concerned.'

Mr Trad fired back: 'This is a man who lives with a lot of fear in his life.

'All he has to do is give me a call I'll take him to have a coffee.

'He can scan me for any accessories. I won't even bring a pen so he wont feel afraid.'

Mr Trad said he lives on an 'austere wage' but is not on a pension. The last major project he was paid for was his book of love poetry, Forays of the Heart, released in October 2013.

'A heart in love, But a heart in pain, Chirps like a dove, Does itself disdain': The book of love poetry released by the Islamic community spokesman Keysar Trad.
