Glasgow Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend admitted too many handling errors cost his side as they lost 12-9 to Toulouse in Pool Four of the European Champions Cup.

The game came down to penalties, with Toulouse scrum-half Nicolas Bezy booting two in the first half and two more after the break.

Finn Russell was not so clinical for Glasgow, spurning a pair of decent chances — and it took a pair of late penalties from replacement Duncan Weir to make it a tense finish.

Toulouse scrum-half Nicolas Bezy kicked all his sides points in their narrow 12-9 victory over Glasgow 

Townsend said: ‘The effort was there in a game that never really kicked off. However a mixture of the quality of the opposition, their excellent defence and our errors, particularly handling, left us just short.’

Toulouse are clear at the top of the pool, with Glasgow battling Bath for second spot.

‘We have to win the last two games to qualify — that is the challenge ahead,’ added Townsend.

Toulouse forwards coach William Servat said: ‘Glasgow did not play with the same rhythm as last week. Today they wanted to make war. They were really aggressive in the rucks.’

Exeter maintained their grip on the top of European Challenge Cup Pool Two with a 41-17 victory over La Rochelle at Sandy Park.

The Chiefs ran in five tries courtesy of Kai Horstmann, Greg Bateman, Fetu’u Vainikolo, Tom James, Adam Hughes, with a penalty try and four conversions and a penalty by Ceri Sweeney.
