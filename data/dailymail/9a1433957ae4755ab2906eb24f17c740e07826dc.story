A convicted mob hit man who led a Boy Scout troop while still a killer says he’s living for God now and volunteers his time driving a church bus in suburban Midwest town.

John Veasey was once a feared killer in the Philadelphia mob who survived getting shot to the head three times, aligned with Sicilian crime boss John Stanfa.

Now, Veasey says he attends church and has tried to atone for his dirty deeds.

He worships regularly, he says, and even helps out his church by volunteering to drive their church school bus.

Ironically, this isn’t the first time Veasey has volunteered his time.

Believe it or not, While still murdering for the mob, Veasey was a Boy Scout troop leader.

He was asked in an upcoming 60 Minutes interview about his double life.

‘Those kids didn’t know I was a hit man,’ he smirks, ‘and a lot of parents were mad. But their kids had fun when I took them camping.’

High price: For ratting out his boss, Veasey's former crime family gunned down his brother Billy

Veasey pulled off other hits, but his first—made in broad daylight—would be his most famous and perhaps the most sensationalized in Philadelphia mob history.

In the interview, scheduled to air Sunday, he describes how it felt as he sat waiting, prepared to kill two men on a tree-lined sunny street.

Like ‘I was going to work,’ Veasey shrugs, ‘and part of my work that day was to kill somebody.’

That somebody ended up being rival mobster Mikey ‘Chang’ Ciancaglini, who died on the sidewalk that day in August 1993.

The other man Veasey was hired to kill, rival mob boss Joey Merlino, survived.

The
murder and attempted murder became part of a trial that ultimately took
down Veasey’s boss—with Veasey’s testimony against his old boss as a 
linchpin in the federal case against the mobster.

Veasey’s
decision to turn against Stanfa would cost him. His former associates 
attempted to kill him, but he survived three shots to the head.

Then,
on the very day Veasey was scheduled to rat out Stanfa, Veasey’s 
brother Billy was gunned down on his way to work in what police called 
an intimidation tactic performed to keep Veasey off the stand.

Veasey testified, anyway, and Stanfa was eventually handed five consecutive life sentences.

After serving 10 years for murders to which he confessed in court, Veasey was placed in the witness protection program and began an unlikely life of repentance.

He became something of an enigma in an unnamed Midwestern suburb where he’s made a successful living selling luxury cars.

But as the 60 Minutes interview proves, the former mobster hasn’t lost his signature swagger.

The report, however, questions Veasey’s self-described new lease on life.

Kathy Ciancaglini of Philadelphia, whose husband John was acquitted of Billy Veasey’s murder, claims Veasey has left her and her husband threatening voicemails.
