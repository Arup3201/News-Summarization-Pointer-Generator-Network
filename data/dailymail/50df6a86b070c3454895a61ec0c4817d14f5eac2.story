A Sudanese-born poet who spent ten days living with a man who wants African migrants barred from Australia says the experience was so horrible he started blocking it out almost from the start.

Abraham Nouk and Nick Folkes agreed to live together for the new SBS documentary Living With the Enemy, a six-part series that puts people with opposite views on a controversial topic in close quarters and films the often fiery results.

The provocative method is a way of 'exploring the fault lines of social cohesion in Australia,' SBS says on the show's web site.

The third episode, which airs Wednesday night, focuses on immigration and is one of the most explosive and moving episodes in the series.

Nouk fled war-torn Sudan 10 years ago with his mother and eight siblings and settled in Melbourne. He knew two English words when he arrived, but became the Slam Poet Champion of Victoria and recently came third in the national titles.

A Sydney father-of-two, Mr Folkes strongly believes that letting people from third-world countries migrate to Australia is 'disastrous'.

Mr Nouk said he found filming the SBS show confronting and that he was left feeling 'numb'.

'I figured I might give someone who could be classified as racist to explain themselves… but he didn't,' Mr Nouk told Daily Mail Australia.

'He said Africans are a threat and we aren't contributing to Australia. 

'There were moments where we could have clashed physically. So shortly into filming I went numb and blocked it out.'

The experience was filmed for SBS's new six-part series, Living With The Enemy, which puts people with polar opposite views together

Mr Folkes, who runs his own political party, said while he 'learnt a lot' from living with Mr Nouk the experience did little to change his strong views on immigration.

He believes Australia should preference migrants from Europe and not third-world countries in Africa and the Middle East.

'Third world immigration has been disastrous. Letting African immigrants in… has had no benefit to us,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Folkes bristles at being called a racist, but describes himself as a 'racial realist'.

'There's nothing wrong with diversity, but we need to assimilate people,' he said.

Mr Nouk, who came to Australia in 2004 only knowing two English words, said he found the filming confronting and was left feeling 'numb'

Mr Folkes, who runs his own political party, said while he 'learnt a lot' from living with Mr Nouk the experience did little to change his views on immigration

'Some migrants are incompatible. A lot of these people coming here are ending up on welfare… There are no benefits to Australian people.'

He said Mr Nouk told him there was compassion involved in letting people migrate to Australia from third-world countries, but the outspoken Sydneysider said 'if we do that we're going to end up bankrupt'.

'My attack is on government policy. Abraham saw it as an attack on him. It was difficult for me and him. We clashed and it was basically one big argument,' he said.

'Abraham didn't change my attitude towards refugees from the third world. My convictions were strengthened and reinforced. These countries have their own problems and it's not up to us to solve them.' 

Mr Folkes believes Australia should preference migrants from Europe and not third-world countries in Africa like Sudan, where Mr Nouk was born

Mr Nouk said he didn't learn anything from living with Mr Folkes during filming.

'He basically said I don't deserve to be here... and after meeting me he still didn’t want to be optimistic about what we as young migrants could do,' he said.

'No one would like to experience the numbness of your own emotions but that's what happened. 

'(Nick) says that a certain community doesn't belong here but then he says he's not racist. I just can't even begin to debate that.'

'Living with the Enemy: Immigration' airs 8.30pm Wednesday night on SBS ONE .
