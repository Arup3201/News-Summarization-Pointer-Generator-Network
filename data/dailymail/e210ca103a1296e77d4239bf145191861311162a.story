Louis van Gaal has admitted he does not have the final say on who Manchester United buy before the transfer window closes on Monday night.

United have spent £132million so far this summer so far but still need key additions after making a woeful start under the Dutchman.

The Red Devils are linked with a number of high-profile targets, including Arturo Vidal from Juventus and Ajax's Daley Blind, but Van Gaal will have no say in who arrives with chief executive Ed Woodward firmly in charge.

He told the Manchester Evening News: 'I don't know about transfers between now and Monday because I am not the one who can choose.

'I give my opinion and the player can do what he wants with that opinion.

'Of course I shall say which players I want and which are better to leave and Ed (Woodward) is doing the transfer market. I don't interfere in that process.'

United's £60million man Angel di Maria is set to play against Burnley on Saturday but fellow new signing Marcos Rojo will not feature because of work permit problems.

On Di Maria Van Gaal said: 'He is ready to play'.

But he was more circumspect when talking about Rojo, saying: 'It's only a matter of time. I'm manager of the biggest club in the world, but I can't change the law in Argentina!

'We have to obey the law.'
