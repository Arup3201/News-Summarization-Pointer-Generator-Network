​A depressed postman allegedly hoarded more than 40,000 pieces of mail dating back to 2005 in his Brooklyn home.

Postal workers hauled mail for five hours out of the Flatbush apartment of Joseph Brucato, where the 67-year-old Vietnam veteran had stashed undelivered letters dating back to 2005.

The mail had built up in the home as well as in Brucato's car and office locker while he suffered from depression and alcoholism, according to a complaint filed in a federal court in Brooklyn.

Stash: Joseph Brucato, 67, was accused of hoarding more than a ton of mail in his Flatbush apartment that he was too depressed to deliver

Brucato's landlord, Bruno Honovic, told the New York Post that the postman had rented the apartment for 30 years and no one suspected him of doing anything wrong. 

'It really shocked me,' said Honovic, 72. 'Our neighbor thought maybe he was moving and the post office was helping him out by lending him a truck.' 

The post office was tipped off when a supervisor saw a stockpile of undelivered letters in Brucato's car, which is not authorized to be used for mail deliveries.

Brucato admitted he had used not only his car, but his locker and his home to ferret away letters, which came from his route in Flatbush. 

He cited 'personal reasons' for why he couldn't deliver the mail. In court, his lawyer said that he suffered from alcoholism brought on by depression.

Magistrate Vera Scanlon ordered him to 'abstain from excessive alcohol consumption' before Brucato was released on his own recognizance.

In all, Brucato's stash added up to a 'conservative estimate' of 2,500 pounds according to Special Agent Michael Wu of the Office of Inspector General.

The U.S. Postal Service suspended Brucato without pay pending the result of the trial. Brucato faces up to five years.

The post office now faces the task of delivering those 40,000 letters, though a spokesperson told the New York Daily News she did not know when customers would receive their mail.
