Russian health and safety inspectors have raided a local cheesemaking factory in the city of Omsk, in southwestern Siberia, after one of the workers posted pictures onto Facebook of him having a bath in a vast tub of milk

The friends - four in two pictures and five in another -  'spent a good time cheerfully splashing in the bath with milk used for cheese processing', said one report.

One of the men holds up his shorts for the camera while frolicking in the milk.

A clip also shows men wearing only shorts turning cheese curd in buckets.

According to the comments that were left by Artem Romanov, 27, one of the workers at the Torgovii Dom-Siri cheese factory and who was featured in the snaps, the decision to take a bath in the milk to celebrate a colleague's birthday

The pictures had been reportedly taken in January but only recently became public after they went viral locally causing outrage among people who purchased the factory's products

'If you plan to buy string cheese the next time you go to the supermarket, you may want to check that it wasn't made in Omsk,' warned one Russian newspaper

'The images are believed to have been taken on the premises of Omsk 'The Cheese' trade house, but a company spokesman refused to comment,' reported The Siberian Times.

'As if frolicking in a giant cheese fondue, the workers posed in the milk used to make string cheese.'

'If you plan to buy string cheese the next time you go to the supermarket, you may want to check that it wasn't made in Omsk,' warned one Russian newspaper.

'We are verifying if indeed pictures were taken in this company's cheese processing premises, and whether the pictures of the men are linked to this company,' said Alexander Kriga, head of RosPotrebNadzor, the Russian food safety watchdog, in Omsk region.

An unscheduled visit to the plant was underway today.

'There is a possibility that it was a provocation, we do not exclude it,' he said, without explanation

'The results of the inspection will be made public as soon as possible.'

Omsk is a leading food processing centre in Russia.
