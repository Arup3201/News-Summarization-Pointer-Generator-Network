Anti-capitalist demonstrators have constructed a ‘slum city’ made of wooden  shacks on an historic civic green.

Campaigners camped in Bristol have replaced tents with huts built from  discarded wood and pallets and fitted with front doors and windows.

Some have a range of home comforts including wood-burning stoves, wardrobes,  sofas and kitchen tables and chairs. 

Construction: The Occupy Bristol camp on College Green is becoming a slum city

Protesters said they eventually want to switch all the tents with what they  described as ‘mini houses’ that will reach up to three storeys high.

The development came as protesters camped at St Paul’s Cathedral last night  flaunted a demand to leave sparking a legal battle expected to cost taxpayers  up to £1millon.

The splinter Occupy Bristol protest began 34 days ago and picturesque College  Green is now littered with 60 tents.

But locals are furious that the demonstrators are ruining the historic site,  which is overlooked by Bristol Cathedral.

Conservative councillor Richard Eddy, 46, called for the ’immediate eviction’  of the group.

He said: ‘I have seen the structures and the area is a real state of concern.  The sooner it is all removed and the protestors are evicted the better.

‘Obviously the process of clearing it up will be at the expense of the taxpayer  with the pressures on public finances.

‘It is a complete abuse to stay so long. It is a chronic shame that they have  and the longer they stay the more they are depriving the public of College  Green.’ 

The wooden pallets have been hammered together over the previously green grass  - now destroyed into mud - and the shacks have been built on top.

Protestors have even mapped out ‘roads’ through the camp made of pallets topped  with pieces of old carpet.

They have also erected a gazebo reception area with chairs and cushions and  boards listing their aims.

There are currently six shacks, including a communal kitchen area where food is  prepared.

Occupy Bristol is the largest protest of its kind outside of London.

The first Occupy protest began in September in Wall Street, where police in riot gear raided the camp and evicted dozens of protestors.

But hours later the National Lawyers Guild obtained a court order allowing the protestors to return with their tents.

In Britain, The City of London Corporation has attached eviction notices to tents on the public highway near to St Paul's Cathedral.

They told protestors to leave the area before 6pm yesterday or legal proceedings would be issued in the High Court.

One protestor, named only as Matt, 22, insisted that the camp would soon be  developed into a wooden city right in the heart of Bristol.

He said: ‘Eventually we want to get rid of all the tents and live in these  wooden structures.

’They are temporary and we are not digging into the ground, so technically we  could pick them up and move them whenever we wanted.

’We want to create a slum city.’

The Very Rev Dr David Hoyle, Dean of Bristol Cathedral, also called for the  protestors to leave.

He said: ‘The first of the structures went up over a week ago and since then  they have built more.

’It is of no surprise to me. They have 
said all along that they are going to  stay here and they are now making
 it more physically evident.

‘It has become more visible and people are reacting to that.

‘At the moment we have no plans to evict them but we are asking them to leave  and we have done that formally.’

At St Paul’s Cathedral activists said not a single protester had left, despite  the Corporation of London warning them they had to pack up their tents by 6pm  last night or face a High Court injunction.

As zero hour approached the rag tag group of anti-capitalists openly mocked the  threat and vowed to stay put in the cathedral’s churchyard.

Together: The British protests are being held in solidarity with the Occupy Wall street demonstrators

Some protesters discussed plans for leaving making Christmas decorations and  the sign on one tent declared: 'Hell, no - we won't go!' 

Nathan Cravens, 27, who runs the camp library, said: ‘The general feeling is  excitement at the moment. It's brought us together.’

The eviction notice was issued after U.S. police cleared the Occupy Wall Street  movement camped in New York which had inspired the British protest.

But legal experts said clearing the British protest is expected to be a  protracted legal battle that will rack up a huge legal bill.

Adam Chapman, head of public law at Kingsley Napley, said because of the Human  Rights Act it could drag on for months.

He said: ‘It will cost at least £10,000 to get it to the High Court and if  there is a lot of going back and forth with appeals as we expect, it will run  into the hundreds of thousands.’

With the added costs of policing the protest for months and clearing up the  mess made by protesters, the total bill to the taxpayer is expected to hit  £1million. 

Demonstrators have been camped outside St Paul’s since October 15 after an  attempt to occupy the nearby London Stock Exchange failed.

Similar camps have also been set up in other parts of the country, including a  camp in the grounds of Exeter Cathedral.

St Paul’s Cathedral decided not to join the legal action against the protesters.
