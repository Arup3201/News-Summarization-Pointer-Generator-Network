Situated on one of the most exclusive streets in Britain, it already boasts four bedrooms, three reception rooms, a roof terrace and a courtyard garden.

But now, this house has been put on the market for £12million - because it comes with permission to build a further two floors underneath it.

The semi-detached Edwardian property is located on Mulberry Walk in Chelsea, London, the 16th most expensive street in the UK, where homes with the potential to expand are at a premium.

Prestigious: The homeowner has already gained planning consent to build two stories around 20ft beneath the enormous house. Above, the cream-coloured bedroom

Its owner has already gained planning consent to build two stories underground - with potential buyers offered the chance to excavate about 20ft beneath the house.

Under the plans, approved by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council, buyers could build a new studio, cinema gym, sauna, massage room and changing room on the lowest level.

Meanwhile, a kitchen breakfast room, family room and en-suite bedroom could be created on the lower ground floor.

The 100-year-old house is one of dozens of multi-million pound homes on the exclusive street, which has an average property price of £7.79million.

Although the building work would cost potential buyers a further £1million, it would nearly double the size of the property from 4,500 to a whopping 8,000 square feet.

And despite the property's £12million asking price, estate agents insist it is ‘not an astronomical' cost.

James Pace, of agents Knight Frank, said: 'At this level of the market a lot of people are quite willing to put their own mark on a property.

'The trouble is you can’t build out or up so people are tending to go down. Thanks to the planning consent it is a property with the potential to go from 4,500 square feet to 8,000 square feet.

'It has a lot of appeal for people looking for a considerably bigger house. It is a fabulous example of an Edwardian house. There are not many properties like it in London.

'Most properties in the Chelsea area are Victorian, four or five storey town houses that end to be half the width of this house.

'The planning potential that comes with this property does make a bit of a difference. It is a good price, not an astronomical price by any means.

'It would probably appeal to someone who lives here already and who spends most of their time here.'

It comes as local authorities in upmarket areas of London are said to be clamping down on the number of applications by homeowners to expand their homes by going underground.

Officials 
are believed to be concerned about disruptions caused by building work, 
including the constant noise, the affect on other residents and the 
possible impact on water pressure.

Earlier this year, actress Joan Collins spoke out about her disgust at
 rich residents building basements in Belgravia, West London, where she has
 lived since buying a flat there in the late 1980s.

The
 80-year-old star - who was born in Paddington and looked at 60 
different properties before buying her apartment - said there was ‘too 
much building work going on’ in her local area nowadays.

She told Belgravia magazine: 'It's really sad. I find it shocking that people are digging down to 
put in swimming pools and bowling alleys when they only live here for 
two or three months of the year.'

Speaking out: Actress Joan Collins (left), 80, and Queen guitarist Brian May (right), 66, have both spoken out against building works in the areas they live in

And two weeks ago, Queen guitarist Brian May accused his neighbours of turning upmarket Kensington, also in West London, into a 'hellhole' with their constant building works.

The musician, 66, branded residents of the west London suburb 'selfish', and said they had 'declared war' on his family through constant construction work in his once 'nice quiet decent' neighbourhood.

Writing on the 'Bri's Soapbox' section of his own website, May said he regularly lost sleep and could no longer enjoy sitting in his garden thanks to noise from the machines used by builders.

Last year, an aristocrat joined dozens of people in protesting against 'mega-basements after her neighbour revealed plans to build a vast cinema and games room underneath 
their £3.6m home in an exclusive street in north London.

Pamela, 
Countess Listowel, 77, said rows over people digging beneath their homes are dividing the usually friendly community in a 
conservation area in Hampstead.

She was one of 58 people to  object to Camden council over the application by Iyabode Abiola to undertake extensive excavations beneath her Victorian house.
