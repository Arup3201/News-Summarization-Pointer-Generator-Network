At first glance the garish series of pipes looks like an architectural oversight.

But this is not a poorly-concealed ventilation system - it is in fact a miniature transport system for our feline friends.

Comprising cat-size doorways, bridges and tunnels, a Californian company has come up with a way for humans and cats to live in the same space without getting in each other's way.

Out of the way: Miette the cat tries out a new transport system installed in her owner's home, designed by Californian architecture company Because We Can

Not quite ventilation: The company initially designs feline transport systems, comprising bridges, tunnels and miniature doorways

Mind the cat: Because We Can were inspired to make the systems after initially making one for its office cats to move easily between floors in the company building

Designers and 
architecture company Because We Can, originally came up with the clever
contraption for their own office cat.

The office was made up of a shop space and several loft areas, so to stop their cat having to venture into the same room as customers, they built a bridge between areas.

Jillian Northrup, who manages the company with her 
husband Jeffrey McGrew, said: 'We had built something similar for our 
own office cat in an old location.

'We fabricated a small bridge so our cat could access the areas without having to go in the noisy shop area. He liked it a lot.

'When we told our clients about the project they loved it, but the bridge needed to look like something, not just a cat bridge.

'We wanted it to be a piece on itself, along with serving the cat transit purpose.'

Curious: After customers admired the cat system, the company realised they could create similar designs to sell

Hideaway: The pipe leads to a loft space accessible by a 'cat ladder', right

The pictures show one of the transport systems built for Miette the cat in a home in San Francisco.

After weeks of construction, it was installed in October 2012.

Miss Northrup said: 'It's located in the 
office of our clients house. They spend a lot of time in this room 
working on projects when they are home, so of course, the cat wants to 
be there too.

'We hear that she likes it very much 
and there is a lot of purring happening so we're really pleased and 
think it came out great.'
