A top Tory has been suspended from the Conservative party after boasting on his MySpace page about group sex and taking drugs.

Strategist, Vincent Bailey, 31, has been 'relieved of his duties' as a campaign organiser in the Tory leadership battle in Wales over the claims he made on the social website.

His responses to a questionnaire shocked party officials who are now conducting an inquiry.

Suspended: Vincent Bailey , left, made inappropriate comments on MySpace leading Andrew Davies, right, to suspend him as campaign organiser.

Bailey states that 'gang bangs are good' and in response to a question about drugs he said 'I'm back on the scag bigtime now'.

He has worked as a researcher for Welsh assembly member Andrew Davies since last August and was recently appointed as his leadership campaign organiser following a 'robust selection process.

Mr Bailey's MySpace page, which dates
back five years, was discovered by the Labour party in Wales which 
brought it to the attention of the Conservatives.

Mr Davies said: 'I understand these 
comments were made more than five years ago, long before Vincent Bailey 
took up employment as one of my three members of staff.

Single or group dates: 'Gang bangs are good but single dates are better for the soul'

Number of drugs I have taken: 'Five or six'

In the past have you been on drugs? 'I had two tokes on a spliff at Col's on Tuesday night, but that was the first in a couple of years. I'm back on the scag bigtime now'

What  do you want to be when you grow up? 'A sexual predator or journalist - I believe that these are not mutually exclusive'

'Vincent successfully completed a 
very robust and competitive selection process before being offered this 
position in August last year.

'When I first heard of these 
allegations I took the decision within the hour to suspend Vincent with 
immediate effect, subject to an inquiry to be held with the assistance 
of the Assembly's human resources department.'

Mr Bailey said: 'While I 
apologise for the embarrassment caused, the account has been inactive 
for over five years and I did not write the offensive comments 
highlighted by Labour. I will co-operate fully with the inquiry.'

By today the MySpace page had been taken down.

Mr Davies, a regional AM representing
South Wales Central, is in a leadership contest with Monmouth AM Nick 
Ramsay. The winner will be announced next month.
