Police believe Dalambert first side-swiped a SUV before striking a parked double-decker bus - which was empty save for the driver - before mounting the curb of Seventh Ave.

DMV records obtained by The Daily News show Dalambert's traffic convictions date back to June 1993, when his license was first suspended.

His most recent offense was in December 2013, when he was caught driving in New Jersey without a license, registration or insurance.

The information has raised serious questions about the vetting processes of tour bus drivers.

The New York Post reported that both Gray Line and City Sights tour buses are inspected twice a year by the state Department of Transportation.Â 

Both passed their inspections in April, according to the paper.

However there are now calls for the buses to be regulated on a city level.

So great was the noise of the red bus Dalambert was driving colliding with the second bus, people in the area believed a bomb had gone off.

The glass windows at the front of Dalambert's bus were shattered in the crash, sending shards flying into passers-by.

A yellow traffic light also toppled, its metal pole smashing down onto the sidewalk.

'I heard an explosion and I ran in the opposite direction - I thought it was a bomb,' one female British tourist told Good Morning America.

Of the 15 people injured - 14 of them pedestrians - none were considered life-threatening, the Fire Department of New York said.

Dalambert was the only person in his bus at the time of the incident.

He did not appear to have any injuries.

Police said the scene was initially chaotic, with some people running around trying to help and others fleeing.

Rose Cantillon was visiting the city from Ireland and was nearby.

'I was sitting on a bench, and I turned around and heard screaming, and I ran,' she said.

The accident occurred around 47th Street and Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, an area of Times Square usually teeming with tourists, near the TKTS discount Broadway tickets booth and the Hershey's Chocolate World store.

One stretch of Seventh Avenue was closed down for some time on Tuesday.

It wasn't immediately clear if Dalambert had a lawyer.

Iconified as The Crossroads Of The World, Times Square is the hub of the Broadway Theater District, one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections, and a major center of the world's entertainment industry
