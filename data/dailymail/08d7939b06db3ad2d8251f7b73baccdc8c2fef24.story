An American couple convicted in Qatar of child endangerment has spoken out about their situation.

Parents Matthew and Grace Huang of Los Angeles will receive a final verdict on their appeal on November 30, a Qatari judge announced October 20.

The Huangs, of Los Angeles, were originally jailed on murder charges following the January 2013 death of their adopted daughter Gloria.

The Huangs recently spoke to Katie Couric in an interview for Yahoo! News.

'I believe that the authorities in Qatar suspected foul play because we are Asians and we adopted three children from Africa, who are black, and this country does not understand adoptions,' Matthew Huang said during the interview.

Parents: Grace and Matthew Huang are appealing their child endangerment conviction with the Qatari government - and the prosecution has also appealed, asking for the death penalty 

Murder? The prosecution alleged that the couple had denied food to Gloria and said the child was locked in her room at night

Grace Huang further explained, 'It's just not done here. They don't even have a word for adoption. I was asked over and over whether I was the "real mom."'

Yahoo News! reported that 'authorities arrested the couple and accused them of killing their daughter in order to sell her body parts on the black market.'

The Huangs were released from prison last November, but banned from leaving during the trial. In March, the court sentenced them to three years in prison for child endangerment.

Speaking about their imprisonment, Grace Huang said in the Yahoo! News interview 'It was incomprehensible to us. We were put in prison and taken back and forth to court every two weeks and we did not understand what was happening. Things were not translated. I was not allowed to see Matt or the kids.'

The Huangs have remained out of prison during their appeal. They have insisted that their daughter, who was born in Ghana, died of medical problems complicated by unusual eating habits.

However, Matthew Huang said in the Yahoo News! interview 'A lot of her struggles were from malnourishment from when she was younger.'

At one point, Matthew Huang said in interview 'We appealed our three-year sentence, and so we are in an appeals court. The government prosecution appealed our three-year sentence and is requesting a death penalty, so we have been tried again on the same charges as we were before.'

The case has raised concerns about possible cultural misunderstandings in Qatar, where Western-style adoptions and cross-cultural families are relatively rare

Grace Huang then said to Couric 'I can relate to you not understanding the purposes of these hearings, because a lot of times I don't, we don't, understand why it just keeps going, and going, and going and going and they keep bringing the same things up over and over again, the same things happen over and over again. It just has no end.'

Matthew Huang earlier told reporters outside the courtroom on October 20 'It feels like there is no end to this. The Qatar government is ignoring the calls of the U.S. government for our release.'

Matthew Huang also spoke of a fear of being outside during his interview with Couric.

'I'm fearful of this country, I'm fearful of the government. I feel trapped and I don't trust that this government is able to do the right thing.'

He also spoke of a fear of reprisal for giving the interview.

'I'm very fearful,' he told Couric. 'I'm scared of this court. I'm fearful of many things and I'm scared. I'm scared of this court. I'm scared of what the authorities might do to us.'

Family: The couple has two other African-born adopted children who left Qatar during the trial to live with relatives in the United States

The couple has two other African-born adopted children who left Qatar during the trial to live with relatives in the United States. Washington has urged its Gulf ally to lift their travel ban. The couple met with U.S. Ambassador to Qatar Dana Shell Smith on October 19.

The prosecution alleged that the couple had denied food to Gloria and said the child was locked in her room at night. The girl was pronounced dead when the Huangs took her to the hospital in January 2013.

The case has raised concerns about possible cultural misunderstandings in Qatar, where Western-style adoptions and cross-cultural families are relatively rare. An investigative report by the Qatari police had focused partially on why the Huangs would adopt children who did not share their 'hereditary traits', according to the family's website.

The Huangs will be able to take their case to a higher court after the appeals verdict, though Qatar's highest judicial body traditionally rules in favor of the lower court's rulings.
