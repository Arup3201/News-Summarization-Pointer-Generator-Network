A million-dollar drawing by Pablo Picasso was snapped up on Wednesday by a 25-year-old art lover from Pennsylvania at an online charity raffle for a mere $140.

Jeffrey Gonano had been looking for a picture to hang on his living room wall when he read a news article about L'Homme au Gibus (Man with Opera Hat), raffled by Sotheby's in Paris.

'I was looking for art and I thought I might as well,' the project manager at a fire sprinkler firm said.

His girlfriend, Gloria Spataro told triblive.com: 'He just recently began looking for pieces of art for his home.'

Despite the enormous value of his new acquisition, Mr Gonano, from Wexford, vowed not to sell the artwork - at least for the time being.

His winning ticket, 747815 - picked by a computer system on Wednesday - was one of 50,000 put up for sale online at 100 euros each to raise funds for an association working to preserve the ancient city of Tyre, in modern day Lebanon.

Organizers said that buyers from France and Germany to Iran and Kyrgyzstan had taken part, with a particularly large number of Americans.

The small drawing dates from 1914, during the artist's Cubist phase, and was purchased by the Association to Save Tyre from a New York gallery with the help of a large bank loan. 

Mr Gonano's girlfriend Gloria recently said that he had started looking for artwork for his home when he entered the competition to win a Picasso

Organizers say they paid slightly less for the work than the one million dollar estimate given by Sotheby's experts.

The
 sale was given the green light by Picasso's grandson Olivier Picasso 
who said his grandfather would have been thrilled that his work was 
being put to good use.

'My 
grandfather was a pioneer in everything, in his love life, in his 
artwork, so tonight I'm sure he would have helped the cause,' he said.

For the moment the work's new owner said he still could not believe his luck.

'I'm still in shock. I've never won anything like this before... Obviously,' he said.
