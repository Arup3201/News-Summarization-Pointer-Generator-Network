Many people will be giving up chocolate for Lent but for one mother, the sacrifice will be especially difficult as she currently eats the treat morning, noon and night.

Rachel Evans, 36, from Cardiff, appeared on today's This Morning where she revealed the full extent of her addiction. 

She said: 'I eat chocolate every day. I don't just eat one bar or one bag. I'll eat one and have another an hour later - family sized bags and bars, huge amounts of chocolate. 

'I eat amounts that would make others physically sick.

'I'll have it mid morning, lunch time, afternoon, evening and on the sofa at night.'

Rachel explained to presenters Phillip Schofield and Christine Bleakley that she has loved chocolate 'for as long as I can remember.'

She said: 'I was brought up to eat healthily and chocolate was just a treat. 

'I used to be afraid of going to the dentist so I would be given it afterwards as a treat. When I moved out of home I started buying it for myself and it went from there.'

She said she has no self-control when it comes to chocolate and she can consume a whole packet of chocolate biscuits or a chocolate cake in one sitting.

'I do feel guilty afterwards but not for long, so then I eat it again,' she said. 

While she was once successful in quitting smoking, she said attempts to give up chocolate have always failed.  

She said: ''It's totally addictive to me, I don't want to, there's no reason for it but I can't stop eating chocolate.

'People say "don't keep it in the house, then you won't be able to eat it" but I'll just drive to the shops and get some or eat it while I'm at work.'

As she approaches Easter, her 'favourite time of year' because of all the chocolate eggs on offer, Rachel said she wants to be able to give up the treat once and for all. 

She said she's concerned about the effect her eating habits are having on her own health and the example she is setting her children.

She said: 'It (chocolate) is beautiful but it's no good for me. I'm trying to lead a healthier life, I have lost weight and started running but I can't get rid of it. 

'I'm worried about the impact on my children, I control what they eat but my six-year-old already asks me for chocolate when she sees me eating it. It's not good for the future in that sense.' 

She said she'd also save money on her shopping bills if she wasn't buying so much chocolate every week as she currently spends an 'awful' amount. 

Therapists The Speakmans on This Morning said they would be able to stop Rachel craving chocolate

The ITV show introduced Rachel to therapists The Speakmans who promised that they would be able to cure her using their techniques.

Remarkably, when Rachel returned to the This Morning sofa an hour later, she said she was a new woman.

A plate of chocolate cakes and bars were brought out and offered to her but she said she wasn't tempted at all. 

After a short session with The Speakmans, Rachel was able to resist this plate of chocolate offered to her

She said: 'I don't want to look at it, it doesn't appeal to me.' 

The mother cried in relief over the fact she no longer felt controlled by her need to eat chocolate.

Nik and Eva Speakman said their techniques involved changing Rachel's perception of chocolate and the way she associated with a reward. 

They wanted to replace how Rachel felt about chocolate with how she felt about less appetising food - such as offal - so that just the thought of eating chocolate would become revolting.  

For anyone seeking to overcome an addiction to comfort eating, they recommend looking for alternatives so you don't feel deprived (eg replacing milk chocolate with dark chocolate or having chocolate sprinkles on a coffee rather than a chocolate bar), not buying the fattening products in the first place and not telling yourself you 'can't' have something - as denial will make you crave it more.
