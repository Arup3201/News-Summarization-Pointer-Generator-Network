Gary Neville believes English football is shooting itself in the foot by allowing foreign players to dominate the Premier League at the expense of home-grown talent.

After another summer in which almost the entire top flight has looked abroad for new signings, England coach Neville believes the decline in players from the Home Nations and Ireland is an alarming trend.

The former Manchester United star told The Sun: 'We are slowly killing ourselves. We laugh at Scotland and the Republic of Ireland but it's happening to England before our eyes.

Concerns: Gary Neville believes English football is 'slowly killing itself' by allowing too many foreign players to take precedence over home-grown talents in the Premier League 

Low point: Neville was right-hand man to Roy Hodgson during this summer's World Cup, but England failed to advance beyond the group stage 

'25 years ago Liverpool had Republic of Ireland players and Scottish players, Manchester United had Scottish players, Irish players and Welsh players.

'All the top six teams did and now there are none. There are a few English players but they're dwindling fast.

'That's not an excuse for the summer and we should have done a lot better but kids are getting blocked and there's no pathway through for them.'

Impressive: Neville urged Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal to play Tyler Blackett this season

Neville, 39, believes a 50-50 balance between foreign and home-grown players in the Premier League is about right.

He also urged new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal to promote players from the club's academy rather than importing them from abroad.

'I've been encouraged that the manager has played youngsters Michael Keane and Tyler Blackett,' Neville said.

'United fans always crave signings but I'd rather see Blackett play than a new signing.'
