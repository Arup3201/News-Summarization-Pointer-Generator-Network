Bayern Munich playmaker Xherdan Shaqiri has revealed Liverpool tried to sign him during the summer transfer window.

Brendan Rodgers launched a bid to sign the Swiss international which was subsequently turned down by the Bundesliga giants.

Shaqiri, who is yet to hold down a regular first team place at the Allianz Arena, has admitted he will contemplate whether he should extend his current contract beyond 2016 during the winter break.
