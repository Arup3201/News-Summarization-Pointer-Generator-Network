Jailed: Donna Wright, pictured at an earlier court hearing, was given an eight-week prison sentence for harassing the family of missing Katrice Lee

An internet troll who posed as a girl disappeared more than 30 years ago, then harassed her distraught family, has been jailed.

Donna Wright, 34, pretended to be Katrice Lee, who vanished in Germany in 1981 aged two.

But when a DNA test proved that she wasn't her, she started harassing Katrice's parents over Facebook and by telephone.

But even after a court banned her last year from contacting the family she persistently called them and hurled abuse down the telephone.

Wright, from West Cornforth in County Durham, was given an eight-week jail sentence after admitting harassment against Katrice's father Richard Lee, 64.

She will serve a total of 14 weeks behind bars on account of a suspended sentence she was given at the previous hearing in 2013, where she was convicted of harassing the missing girl's mother Sharon and her sister Natasha.

Katrice vanished from an army-run supply store in Paderborn, West Germany on November 28, 1981, her second birthday.

Her father, her second birthday while on a shopping trip for party supplies.

Her father, a soldier with the King's Royal Hussars, was stationed nearby at the time, and her family headed out  the busy Naafi store, where she vanished in the crowds.

Wright, who is the same age as Katrice would be now, first answered an appeal for information in 2012.

Newton Aycliffe Magistrates’ Court 
previously heard Wright turned nasty after a DNA test proved she was not
 the missing girl, and sent spiteful messages over Facebook.

But after eight court hearings and sacking her solicitor, Wright admitted harassing 64-year-old Mr Lee, from Hartlepool, after conclusive phone records were produced.

Vicky Wilson, prosecuting, told the court: 'Donna Wright called Mr Lee on the landline
phone on December 1. On the first occasion she hung up.

'On the next occasion she said, "Are you Mr Lee, the father of Katrice?" She said to Mr Lee on the phone, why he had put a picture of an 11-year-old on Facebook.

'It was in fact she who had put a picture of her 11-year-old daughter on Facebook saying it was Katrice. Mr Lee told her the phone call would be traced and that he knew who she was.

'She replied with some abusive language, before hanging up. She then persisted to try to call him again through the night.'

In an impact statement read to the court, Mr Lee described Wright's actions as 'despicable'.

He said: 'If I could ask you to walk in my shoes for just one day, as I have walked the last 32 years
then maybe, just maybe, you can understand the depth of feeling I have towards this individual.

'To be targeted by Ms Wright, who I have to say I have found to be a thoroughly nasty and evil person, has magnified this ordeal.

'To ignore the judge is disrespectful. To seek my telephone number and bombard me with abuse is despicable'.

Viv Waugh, defending, added: 'She has to accept that what has happened is unfortunate to say the least. When the matter was before you last year the diagnosis for Ms Wright suggested clear mental health issues.

'I would ask you to take a view that there are exceptional circumstances in this case. If custodial sentence was given over eight weeks she would lose her sheltered accommodation and her support workers.'

Sentencing Weight, Judge Martin Walker told her: 'The contact you made was hurtful and caused distress. It was abusive and aggressive.'

Speaking after the verdict, Mr Lee said she was a sick individual and had wasted public money.

'The only justice I have got out of it is I will sleep easy in the coming weeks as I won’t have to worry that she will ring me,' he said.

He said the family was already serving a life sentence due to the fact their daughter was abducted and they have no answers, and that Wright’s campaign against them had distracted his family from their aim of finding his daughter.

Katrice
 Lee went missing as her mother was buying crisps at a shop near an Army
 base in Paderborn, Germany, where her father was stationed with the 
King's Royal Hussars.

It was Katrice's birthday and the family went to a nearby NAAFI to purchase items for a party to mark the occasion.

The youngster and her mother were at the check out when Mrs Lee briefly went to get some crisps.But when she returned, Katrice had vanished.

At
 the time, police believed Katrice had fallen into the nearby River 
Lippe and drowned, but despite searches a body was never found.

Officers reopened the case in 2000 after they created a computer-generated image of how she could now look.

Her
 story later appeared on the BBC's Missing Live programme during which a
 digitial recreation was used to show what she could look like as a 
29-year-old.

Katrice's older sister Natasha later appeared on Crimewatch to highlight the appeal.

Believing she was snatched, her parents – who divorced 20 years ago – later set up a Facebook page dedicated to finding her.
