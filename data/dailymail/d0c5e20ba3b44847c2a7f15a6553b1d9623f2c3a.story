Everton manager Roberto Martinez is seeking a January reunion with Scotland's Euro 2016 hero Shaun Maloney.

Martinez travelled to Glasgow to see Maloney score an outstanding winning goal against the Republic of Ireland during the international break and is keen to bring the 31-year-old midfielder to Goodison before his contract runs out in the summer.

Maloney was signed by Martinez at Wigan in 2011 from Celtic and helped the club win the FA Cup last year.

With Wigan aware that Maloney is unlikely to sell a new deal, they will have to sell him in January or face losing him for nothing at the end of the season. He would be expected to fetch around £500,000.

Although Martinez's relationship Maloney would make Everton firm favourites to seal a deal, the player would be likely to attract several offers from home and abroad if Wigan agreed to let him go in January.

MLS Club Chicago Fire have reportedly shown an interest while other Premier League clubs are monitoring the situation.

Wigan's new boss Malky Mackay would be reluctant to lose Maloney so soon into his tenure at the DW Stadium but would hope to re-invest any transfer fee in new players.

The club have endured a torrid week off the field following the controversial appointment of Mackay while he is still under an FA investigation for exchanging allegedly racist and sexist texts.

Owner Dave Whelan could also face charges after giving an interview in which he he reportedly made remarks that were offensive to the Jewish and Chinese communities.
