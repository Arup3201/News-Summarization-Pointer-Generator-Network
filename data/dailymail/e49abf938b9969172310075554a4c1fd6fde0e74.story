Heidi Klum has hit back at Seal's suggestion she cheated on him with a bodyguard during their marriage.

The supermodel, 39, who looked strained as she jetted out of Los Angeles this morning, issued a statement today insisting there was no third party involved in their split. 

'Our separation was based on issues between the two of us,' she told People magazine.

All smiles: Heidi Klum looked in good spirits as she arrived in New York today on a flight from Los Angeles

Firing back: Klum says her split with Seal was to do with issues they had together and that no third party was involved

She also reminded the public that the
Kiss From A Rose singer has had his own romantic liaisons since their break-up,
adding: 'Seal has moved on and so have I.'

Despite the ugly and unexpected twist
in their seemingly amicable divorce, she tried to remain positive about
their time together.

'I cherish all of the great memories Seal and I created together over the years,' she said. 

She concluded: 'My priority has and continues to be protecting and providing for our children.'

Under attack: Earlier the model was seen leaving Los 
Angeles after her estranged husband Seal's claims she cheated on 
him during their marriage

Turning bitter: Heidi jetted out alone and 
right, Seal arriving at LAX on Friday where he was asked about the 
supermodel's romance with her bodyguard 

Seal, 49, shocked fans - and Heidi - on 
Friday when he was asked by TMZ about pictures of his estranged wife 
cosying up to her bodyguard Martin Kristen on a family vacation in Sardinia. Kristen worked for the family while Heidi was married to Seal.

He replied: 'Whilst I didn't expect 
anything better from him, I would have thought that Heidi would have 
shown a little more class and at least waited until we separated first 
before deciding to fornicate with the help.'

He continued: 'I guess you now all have the answer that you’ve been looking for for the past seven months.'

He's moved on too, remember! Seal was pictured with a brunette during his own visit to Sardinia in July

But however unambiguous his words 
sounded, a representative for the British singer yesterday backtracked, 
claiming he had not meant to accuse Heidi of cheating. 

The representative told Us Weekly: 
‘Seal would like to clarify that he was not implying his wife was 
cheating while they were together, but he was merely pointing out that 
their separation and divorce were not final and they are still legally 
married.’

Although they were believed to have one of the most rock-solid marriages in showbiz, Seal, 49, and Heidi, 39, announced the end of their seven-year union in January.

The two have four children together who they continue to co-parent - Leni, eight, Henry, six, Johan, five, and Lou, two.
