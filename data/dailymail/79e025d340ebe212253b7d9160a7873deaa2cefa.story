Holidaymakers en route from Spain to London on a coach were left stranded at the roadside for 12 hours – after their driver was arrested by police.

More than 60 passengers – including Britons - on the budget Megabus service were 'abandoned' at a Spanish motorway service station after the company failed to send out another driver.

Many people were forced to call and pay for taxis to stay in nearby hotels after discovering it was too late to make alternative travel arrangements.

And 10 travellers spent the night on the coach at the service station on the AP7 motorway, 50 miles north of Barcelona.

Officers phoned Megabus to ask if it was going to send a replacement after detaining the 48-year-old Brit for allegedly using another driver's tachograph card.

Customers were kept waiting for several hours before being told the company could not send anyone.

Speaking from the scene, one passenger said: 'There's people of all nationalities on board including British and French and none of us know what to do.

'Holidays have been ruined. We've spoken to one man who has a plane to catch tomorrow in France and has no idea now how he's going to arrive on time or if the company is going to reimburse him if he misses his plane.'

Police gave some passengers a lift to Girona Railway Station near the border with France - more than 12 hours after the coach was stopped - so they could continue their journeys.

The driver was on Monday being held at a police station in Santa Coloma de Farners near Girona.

He was expected to be questioned by a judge in a private hearing before being released on bail ahead of a full court probe.

He was taken into custody at 5pm on Sunday after being stopped at Macanet de la Selva a half-hour drive north of the Catalan capital. 

A spokesman for the Mossos D'Esquadra regional police force said: 'Officers discovered during a routine stop that the driver was using a tachograph card belonging to someone else and arrested him for using false documentation.

'We immobilised the vehicle and after considerable effort managed to get through to someone at Megabus to explain what had happened and ask if the firm would send a replacement driver.

'The hours went by and we didn't get an answer and some passengers began to make alternative travel arrangements with some leaving by taxi.

'But ten people ended up spending the night on the bus and as a gesture of goodwill we took them to Girona Railway Station this morning so they could continue their journeys.

'The coach was travelling from Barcelona to London via Toulouse.

'There were several nationalities on board including British nationals. 

Megabus said the driver on board its Barcelona to London coach had the right documents

'We understand customers did receive text messages in the end from the company saying it wouldn't be sending a replacement driver but would reimburse them for any extra costs.

'But they didn't get those messages for several hours and the company didn't come back to us at all.

'It's very rare for us to have to get involved in something like this.

'It's not the first time we've had to immobilise a coach but normally companies send replacement drivers fairly quickly.

'We don't know why the arrested driver was using someone else's card.'

Budget coach operator Megabus is owned by multinational transport group Stagecoach.

The firm offers services in Europe, the United States and Canada.

In a statement, Megabus said the company was 'very sorry' for the delay.

It added: 'Our driver had the correct documentation and identification for his journey and was well within his legal driving hours.

'There appears to have been a technical issue with the way the journey was being recorded.

'To be very clear, we arranged two buses, supplied by a Spanish operator, which arrived on site to take passengers onwards to their destination.

'However, we are concerned that passengers were prevented from using these vehicles by local Spanish police which obviously led to significant delays for our customers.'

It added: 'The service was delayed overnight following a technical issue involving the journey recording equipment that arose during a check in Spain.

'Our team kept in touch with passengers by email throughout the night and attempted to find accommodation for them which unfortunately was not possible.

'We advised that we would cover all costs for passengers who made their own arrangements for onward travel. We will also be issuing a full refund and providing complimentary return travel for all customers affected.'
