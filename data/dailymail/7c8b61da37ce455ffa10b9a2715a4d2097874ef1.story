These stunning photographs show the faces of some of the world's most rarely seen tribes people.

Captured wearing elaborate head dresses, the fascinating images give an insight into the unique rituals and traditions of the Dani and Asmat tribes of New Guinea Island, Indonesia.

Photographer Andrey Gudkov, 42, was granted the rare privilege of spending time with the indigenous people of New Guinea Island, Indonesia.

Made from brightly coloured feathers and furs, the impressive creations are used in ceremonial gatherings and are often a symbol of status.

Each tribe lives in remote areas and has had very limited contact with the outside world and members from the Dani tribe and the Asmats have a reputation for being ferocious fighters.

Despite being known for their warrior culture, both tribes happily accepted Andrey into their fold and gave him permission to photograph their way of life. 

Andrey said: 'The Asmats are known for being ferocious warriors and often wear bones through their noses.

'It is believed that the Asmats killed Michael, C. Rockerfeller, the son of New York governor Nelson Rockefeller.

'I know of their history but I never felt threatened and they welcomed me into their tribe.

'Their way of life is truly fascinating, the time I spent with those people is something I will never forget.

'Unfortunately, many of their customs will soon be lost as timber and logging companies have begun to employ younger members.'
