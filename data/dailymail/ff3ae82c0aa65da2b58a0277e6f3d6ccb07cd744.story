It was set up to deal with non-emergency calls in a bid to free up phonelines for people who need urgent help from police.

But when one dim-witted caller was unsure if he would need to dial a local code to call the 101 non-emergency number he decided the only people who could help him were emergency services. 

A recording of the 999 call made from Birmingham reveals the man asking a call operator if he needed to dial an area code or press a hash key to get through to 101.

The 30 second call, in which the man addresses the call handler as 'sweet heart', has been released by West Midlands police to shame callers who waste police time.

A dim witted caller rang 999 to ask for instructions for how to call 101, the non-emergency number set up to free the emergency line. Bernard Hogan-Howe (left) marked the 75th anniversary of 999 calls in 2012 

The maximum sentence for the offence is six months in prison.

A spokeswoman for the force said: 'The call is simply unbelievable. We take thousands of 999 calls every day and more than 90 per cent of those are answered within 10 seconds.

'Each call often takes minutes to deal with as staff have to clarify the situation. 

'It may not sound like much, but if someone is trying to get through to report a genuine life or death emergency, every second counts.'

The call was actually made last year but has released to raise awareness of the need for calls to be made properly so time is not wasted. 

Earlier this month neighbouring force West Mercia Police revealed one caller dialled 999 to complain about his wife - because she refused to give him the TV remote control. Other calls received by the force included a man who dialled 999 because he could not find his wallet and another reporting someone driving by with tinted windows. 

Operator: 'Police emergency.'

Caller: 'Scuse me sweetheart, what I'm after right yeah is the situation is.'

Operator: 'This is the police sir.'

Caller: 'No, what I'm after is, is you know the 101 number?'

Operator: 'Yes.'

Caller: 'Do you have to press 0121? (Birmingham area code)'

Operator: 'No, just 101.'

Caller: 'And press the hash key.'

Operator: 'No, just 101 sir.'

Caller: 'Okay, thank you, right bye.'

Operator: 'Okay, bye.'
