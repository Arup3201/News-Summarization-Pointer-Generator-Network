The wrong kind of hits: The Google Street View driver crashed into two minivans and another parked van before giving up (file pic)

With its easy to search directions and accurate maps Google Street View has become a friend to drivers worldwide.

Except for three drivers in Indonesia whose vehicles were hit by a Google Street View camera car as it photographed streets in Bogor, near Jakarta.

The Google driver, whom police did not name, was collecting data in Subaru hatchback on Wednesday when he hit a public minivan.

According to officers the man actually accompanied the minivan driver to a repair garage, apparently willing to shoulder responsibility for the crime.

However, once there he began to worry about the cost of the repairs and, without waiting to hear the size of the bill, got back into his damaged car and drove off.

The minivan driver also jumped into his vehicle and gave chase but the Google car only managed to get two miles away before he crashed into a second minivan.

With the repair bill increasing by the second, the hapless driver fled AGAIN and only gave himself up after crashing into a third parked van.

After the third crash the man was detained by police and taken in for questioning.

Hendra Gunawan, Bogor district police chief, said: 'He has been released and all the payments for the vehicles have been 
sorted out. The damage to the first one would probably have cost 200,000
rupiah (Â£11) to repair.'

Google could not be contacted for comment.

Google has previously run in to trouble with Street View, which allows 
users to zoom in on real-life everyday images recorded with the 
company's cameras that take 360-degree footage.

Images of an 
Australian couple having sex on the hood of a car on a highway appeared 
on Street View in April, and in March, Google struck a deal with US 
authorities to pay a $7 million fine for collecting people's personal 
data for Street View without authorisation.
