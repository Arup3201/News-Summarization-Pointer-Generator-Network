Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti and keeper Iker Casillas had reason to celebrate in training on Wednesday as they were presented with commemorative shirts for reaching milestones with the club.

Ancelotti was marking his 100th game in charge at the Bernabeu, while Casillas was celebrating his 500th La Liga game between the sticks, both of which came during the 2-0 victory away at Elche on Sunday.

Madrid's boss, who was presented with a shirt with his name and '100' on the back by club president Florentino Perez, has won the Copa del Rey, the Champions League, the Spanish Super Cup, the UEFA Super Cup and the World Club Cup during his century of games in charge.

Ancelotti also recorded his 78th win in the game against Elche to help him eclipse Jose Mourinho as the most successful Real Madrid manager after 100 games. The former boss, who was in charge at the Bernabeu between 2010-13, recorded 77 victories in his first 100.

Third on the list is legendary figure Miguel Munoz, who won 70 of his first 100 - as well as three European Cups as a player and two as a manager between 1955-66. Fourth is Jose Villalonga (64 wins) and fifth is Leo Beenhakker (63).

Casillas, meanwhile, marked his 500th La Liga game with a clean sheet at Elche and was also presented with a shirt by Perez. The Spanish goalkeeper has been a regular at Madrid since making his debut in the 1998-99 season.

'I am thankful, this record is not easy to get being a Real Madrid player, maybe in another club it would have been easier,' said Casillas, after the game on Sunday. 'I never thought about reaching a certain number.'

While Ancelotti added: 'I think that if we've done well in my first 100 games, then we'll try to do even better in the next 100.'

Casillas has come under increased scrutiny this season after a series of high-profile errors. He has come under pressure from summer signing Keylor Navas while the club have also been linked with Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea.

However De Gea, 24, is closing in on a new long-term deal at Old Trafford and manager Ancelotti has made clear he is more than happy with his current goalkeeping options.

Real Madrid sit four points clear of Barcelona at the top of La Liga after Luis Enrique's side slipped up at home against Malaga a day before Real's victory over Elche.

As well as topping the La Liga table, Real Madrid also look set for progression to the quarter-finals of the Champions League after their comfortable 2-0 victory over Schalke in the first leg last week.

Cristiano Ronaldo opened the scoring last Wednesday night in Germany before Marcelo added a second after half-time as Ancelotti's side continued their European title defence.

They welcome Roberto Di Matteo's side to Madrid in two weeks time for the second leg that should be all but a formality. Before that game, however, they have two league matches. They face Villarreal at home on Sunday before travelling to Athletic Bilbao the following Saturday.
