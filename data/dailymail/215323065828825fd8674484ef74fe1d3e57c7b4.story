A popular noodle brand has launched an investigation after pictures emerged online apparently showing maggots crawling around the  lid of one their products.

The disturbing photos were posted on numerous complaint websites by a person using the name 'Concerned Public'. They claimed they bought Maggi Noodles in Coles Coorparoo and Coles Morningside, two neighbouring suburbs in Brisbane's south-east.

The owner of the infested cup of noodles said it was the second time in a month they had found maggots in their noodles and decided to take the matter public to 'alert people of the outbreak'.

Popular brand Maggi have launched an investigation into their noodles after pictures emerged online (above) showing tiny maggots crawling around inside the lid of a cup of beef noodles

The pictures, which show the noodles with an expiry date of October 14, 2015 and September 10, 2015, appear to show a flesh coloured larva perched under the lid of a cup of instant, beef flavoured noodles.

'We have been buying Maggi Noodles for our kids as a snack for a long time and nobody should have to buy a product that has been imported to find maggots, or whatever the infestation is under the lip of the packet,' the concerned consumer said.

'Both times these have been in our cupboards for only a few hours, which is why we are posting this report. We reported it and they promised it would never happen again but it has.'

Nestlé Australia say they received a complaint in February regarding the presence of maggots on a cup of Maggi Noodles.

They told Daily Mail Australia they were investigating the incident together with the Brisbane City Council.  

'The quality and safety of our products is a non-negotiable priority,' a Nestlé spokesperson said. 

'For this reason, we have programs in all our factories and warehouses to monitor for and exclude food pests from the time we receive raw ingredients through to delivery to our customers.'

'We understand that the larvae was found outside the cup of noodles but we take every complaint seriously and are currently conducting tests to identify the type and origin of the larvae.' 

Maggi is a particularly well known brand in Australia, New Zealand, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, Nigeria, the Philippines and Singapore for its instant noodles.

The product, which is made by Swiss company Nestlé, is made and imported from Malaysia.

They are also the manufacturer of a range of well-known Asian sauces, curry sauces, recipe bases and stir fry creations. 

Brisbane City Council told Daily Mail Australia they received notification of this complaint from Queensland Health on February 11, 2015. 

The council was not contacted directly by the owner of the noodle cup.

The complaint said that the cup of Maggi Noodles was purchased from Coles Coorparoo, while online the poster also mentions Coles Morningside.   

'A Council officer conducted an on-site investigation on 11 February 2015 and found that there was no evidence of any pest infestation or issues at Coles Coorparoo,' a council spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 

The owner of the infested cup of noodles said it was the second time in a month they had found maggots (or larvae) in their noodles and decided to take the matter public to 'alert people of the outbreak'

The pictures, which show the noodles with an expiry date of October 14, 2015, appear to show a flesh coloured larva perched under the lid of a cup of instant, beef flavoured noodles

'The insect on the packaging was identified as an insect cocoon and it was found on the exterior of the packaging. There is no evidence it has originated from Coles.'

The council said there is no food safety contamination risk from the cocoon and no further action will be taken against Coles.

Coles Australia refused to comment on the presence of maggots in their Morningside or Coorparoo branches when contacted by Daily Mail Australia.

In a public post online, the owner of the infested noodles said their family would never have known the maggots were in the cup, had they not been under the lid of the noodles.

'They look the same as the noodle and you digest them without even knowing, until you see them crawling out of the cup,' they said.  

According to the online poster, the larva break free of their cocoon when the noodles are heated with boiling water and crawl upwards. However, the owner of the cup claims the maggots fall into the cup because they have nowhere else to go.   

Maggots are the worm-like larvae of flies. They are usually found on food and eat faecal matter, decaying food and flesh. 

If ingested into the human digestive system, maggots can cause gastrointestinal problems, food poisoning and allergic reactions. 

Nestlé said this is an isolated incident and they want to reassure consumers that their suppliers must adhere to their strict, global, responsible sourcing guidelines wherever they operate.
