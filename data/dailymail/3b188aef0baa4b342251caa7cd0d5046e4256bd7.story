New pictures have emerged of teenager cancer victim Stephen Sutton ticking off number 28 on his bucket list by partying in Ibiza.

The 19-year-old, who lost his fight with bowel cancer on Wednesday, had drawn up the 46 point list in January last year, which also included the target of raising £10,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust.

But after the nation took Stephen’s story to their hearts, the teenager’s appeal has now soared past the £4million mark.

As part of the things on his to-do list was to enjoy a ‘lad’s holiday’ and these new pictures show Stephen, of Burntwood in Staffordshire on a trip to the party island last summer.

He can be seen with his friends like any other normal youngster making a splash in the swimming pool as well as enjoying Ibiza’s nightlife. 

The pictures came from a TV documentary filmed on the Balearic Island, which was being created by film-maker Greg Richters.

He told the Good Morning Britain: ‘This is not a story about someone with cancer. This is a story about 19-year-old who did so much in so little time. ‘

Stephen’s story and appeal to raise money for the Teenage Cancer Trust came to prominence after support from celebrities such as comedians Jason Manford and Jimmy Carr, England captain Steven Gerrard and even Prime Minister David Cameron.

His death was announced on Facebook on Wednesday, with people flocking to pay tribute to the inspirational teenager.

His mother Jane also spoke of her heartbreak at the death of her 'courageous, selfless and inspirational' son.

Writing on Facebook she said: ‘My heart is bursting with pride but breaking with pain for my courageous, selfless, inspirational son who passed away peacefully in his sleep in the early hours of this morning, Wednesday 14th May.

The ongoing support and outpouring of love for Stephen will help greatly at this difficult time, in the same way as it helped Stephen throughout his journey.

‘We all know he will never be forgotten, his spirit will live on, in all that he achieved and shared with so many. Love, His mom x’

Siobhan Dunn, Chief Executive of Teenage Cancer Trust added: 'Stephen was an exceptional young man and ambassador for Teenage Cancer Trust.

'He will be remembered for his incredible positivity by all who met or connected with him. Stephen didn’t measure life in time, preferring instead to measure it by the difference someone makes.

'Stephen has made an enormous difference to Teenage Cancer Trust and the seven young people diagnosed with cancer every day who need our help.'
