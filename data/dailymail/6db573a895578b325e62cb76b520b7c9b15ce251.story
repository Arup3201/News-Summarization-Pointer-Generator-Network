A mother facing charges after three dead babies were found stashed in her squalid home has told cops one of the children was born alive and lived for several days before she found it dead.

Erika Murray claims she put the baby down for a nap in a bassinet in her Blackstone, Massachusetts home but when she returned an hour later, the child was dead, her lawyer told the Boston Herald.

The baby had a 'fairly full head of hair' when investigators found its remains in a backpack in her home during a search in August, prosecutors told a court on Tuesday.

Along with another dead child found inside a closet, the baby was found dressed in a diaper and onesie, leading investigators to believe they had been born alive.

Accused: Erika Murray, pictured in court last week, told cops that one of the children found dead in her home had lived for several days before she found it dead. The remains of two other babies were also found

A third dead baby had an umbilical cord and the remains of a placenta still attached to its body.

The remains of the three infants were found in Murray's older children's bedroom closets when authorities executed search warrants after neighbors raised the alarm in August.

The medical examiner's office is working to determine the babies' causes of death.

A spokesman for the district attorney's office refused to comment about the latest claims made by Murray's lawyer, saying: 'Anything we say about this case we'll say in open court.'  

Murray, 31, is being held on $1 million bail on charges including fetal death concealment. 

Scene: The three babies were found in closets in the bedrooms of Murray's older children. Police had searched the home after a neighbor alerted authorities when one of the older children asked her for help

Her four children, ranging in age from five months to 13 years, were rescued from her filthy home on August 28 after her 10-year-old son went to a neighbor's home asking for help to quieten the crying five-month-old baby. The neighbor found the youngest child covered in feces. 

Neither the baby nor Murray's three-year-old child have birth records and both are severely malnourished. authorities said. The infant is extremely sensitive to sunlight and the three-year-old cannot walk, has poor muscle tone and only makes a few sounds.

In court on Tuesday, prosecutors said the three-year-old's muscle tone suggested that she had spent most of her young life on her back.

Blackstone code enforcement officer Bill Walsh said when he walked inside the smell was overwhelming, and that the second floor looked like a landfill.

He recalled rooms covered in feces, maggots and hundreds of dirty diapers. 

Squalid: Investigators said the family's home was covered in soiled diapers, maggots and feces

Shocking: They said that the stench inside the home, where four children lived, was overwhelming

Murray arrived at the house and agreed the children should not live in the home, but did not seem to be upset they would be removed from her care, authorities said. 

After interviewing the older children, police got a search warrant and went back to the house, where they found the skeletal remains of one baby with a full head of hair in a backpack in the closet of an upstairs bedroom. After discovering those remains, police obtained another search warrant.

During the second search, they found the remains of two other babies in another bedroom, also inside a closet. 

When questioned by police in August, Murray admitted that the two youngest children were hers, and said that her live-in-boyfriend, Raymond Rivera, was their father.

She had previously told her two eldest children, aged 10 and 13, to tell teir father that she was simply baby-sitting the two younger children, prosecutors said.

Arrest: Murray's boyfriend Ramon Rivera III is pictured in court on Tuesday. He faces drug charges for allegedly growing marijuana in the basement of the house where they lived in Blackstone, Massachusetts

Rivera, has not been charged in connection with the discovery of the infants' remains, but faces drug charges for allegedly growing marijuana in the home's basement.

Prosecutors also said that the charges against Murray could be upgraded once a grand jury investigation concludes.

The Blackstone Board of Health condemned the house where Murray, Rivera and the children lived and are planning to demolish it later this month.

The two older children are staying with a paternal grandparent, while the two younger ones are receiving medical attention under foster care.
