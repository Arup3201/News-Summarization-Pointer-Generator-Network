Nathan Cleverly will put his body through hell as he plans one final assault on a world title after deciding to move back down to light heavyweight.

The Welshman will return to the division that saw him reign as world champion for three years after his defeat to bitter rival Tony Bellew last November.

Cleverly will be back in the ring on April 11 in Leeds before targeting a shot at WBA regular champion Jurgen Braehmer.

Nathan Cleverly will return to light heavyweight following his defeat to Tony Bellew last November

'It was very soon after the fight that I made the decision to move back down,' he told Sportsmail.

'It was obvious to me from the fight; in the last six rounds I felt sluggish and just sapped of energy.

'It was definitely the weight that was slowing me down.

'It was a calculated gamble moving up to cruiserweight and I'm not quite big enough for the division so the only option is to move back down to light heavyweight and hopefully get back to my best.'

Cleverly said he felt sluggish in the second half of the fight as Bellew won by split decision

Cleverly, who lost his WBO crown to Sergey Kovalev in 2013 before winning his first two fights at cruiserweight, insisted he gave only the briefest of thoughts to retiring.

'In the aftermath of fights, you sometimes have a few moments when you reflect on whether you've got it anymore,' he said.

'But then you go away and have some time out of boxing and find your true self. I'm a fighter and I love the buzz of boxing.

'It gives me ambition and passion and I just can't let it go; I need to get that world title back in my life.'

But Cleverly admitted the process of stripping away the 25lb he had added to his frame will be far from simple.

'In an ideal world there would be a weight between light heavyweight and cruiserweight but there's not,' he added.

'It's going to be very difficult. I'm a little bit bigger now and I've got to strip away a bit of muscle.

'My body fat has got to be exceptionally low and my diet has got to change. It's got to be specific to losing weight while maintaining high energy levels.

Cleverly is ready for tough challenge of losing the extra weight gained when he moved up a division

'It's going to be very, very tough and I'm under no illusions but it's something all top fighters have to deal with.'

Cleverly will bring in a nutritionist but plans to remain under the tutelage of trainer Darren Wilson.

And after his tune-up in Leeds, he wants a shot at Braehmer, who he was scheduled to fight in 2010 before the German pulled out.

'Braehmer is the target,' Cleverly said. 'The promoters have talked and it looks like we can make it happen.

'We've got a lot of history and hopefully we can get the fight on.

'You could say it's my last chance because if I can't grab a world title now, then where do I go?

'This is my last chance and I won't waste it.'
