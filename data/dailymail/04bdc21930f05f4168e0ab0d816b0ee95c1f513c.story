More than 60 Cleveland police officers involved in an unauthorized car chase in which 137 shots were fired, killing two unarmed people, have been suspended.

A panicked driver and passenger fleeing police were shot dead in November following a 23-minute pursuit in which more than 60 cruisers sped through residential neighborhoods.

While only two police cars are allowed to
 give chase, dozens of cruisers joined the pursuit 
because they believed the two victims were armed.

Tragic: Timothy Russell, 43, and Malissa Williams, 30, were shot dead by police in November following a 23-minute chase through Cleveland. The pair had fled a traffic stop and were speeding, but were unarmed

Police Chief Mark McGrath announced today that 63
 of the 104 officers involved will be suspended for up to 10 days, while
 13 directly involved in the shooting could face criminal charges. The police union said it would appeal the decision.

Last year's shocking chase began about 10.30pm when an officer thought he heard a gunshot from a car speeding past the police and courts complex in downtown Cleveland.

Jumping into his patrol car and radioing for help, the officer pursued driver Timothy Russell, 43, and passenger, Malissa Williams, 30, who allegedly refused to stop.

Police don't know why the pair didn't pull over, but it is believed they panicked.

About 60 cars joined the November 2 pursuit 'without the sector supervisor’s knowledge or permission', according to a state investigation of the incident.

Only two police vehicles are allowed to be involved in a chase.

During the pursuit, which reached speeds of 125mph, many of the officers had reportedly not followed instructions about switching their radios to the main communications channel and did not hear orders to discontinue the chase.

Officers claimed they joined the chase because they 
thought Russell and Williams were shooting at police and believed 'a
 police officer was in trouble.'

The chase went through crowded residential neighborhoods, then reversed course, heading east onto the busy I-90 and through parts of Cleveland and East Cleveland.

Frightening: Police opened fire on the pair outside Heritage Middle School in East Cleveland in November

As the chase ended near a school, Russell allegedly rammed a patrol car and drove toward an officer on foot.

That's when gunfire erupted, with 13 officers firing 137 rounds at the car.

Russell was shot 23 times and Williams
 24 times in what civil rights groups described as an 'execution-style 
killing'. The pair was unarmed.

While officers believed shots had been 
fired from Russell's car, investigators now say it was the sound of the 
1979 Chevy backfiring.

Russell
 had a criminal record including convictions for receiving stolen 
property and robbery, while Williams had convictions for drug-related 
charges and attempted abduction.

McGrath said, following an 11-month investigation, 63 officers will be suspended totaling 178 days. The longest suspension is 10 days.

He said the officers are being disciplined because of excessive speed, insubordination and failure to request permission to join the pursuit.

'Under a stressful, tactful situation, it’s more important to follow your rules and procedures than ever before, or you may have some type of chaos or problems,' McGrath said, according to cleveland.com.

Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson said county prosecutors have not yet decided whether to bring criminal charges against the 13 officers directly involved in the shooting.

He said 'justice was not delayed for the victims', even though the investigation had taken 11 months.

He said his office was 'not throwing officers under the bus for political reasons and we're not covering anything up.'

However, Jeff Follmer, president of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen’s Association, said the union will challenge the suspensions through arbitration.

'The suspensions are not consistent with what other officers received after similar chases,' Follmer said, according to cleveland.com. 'I think the department is responding to public pressure in this case.'

Nine Cleveland police department 
supervisors were suspended, two demoted and one fired due to the way 
they handled the incident, McGrath said.

Last year's shoot-out sparked outrage within Cleveland's black community who argued the pursuit was racially-motivated and violated the victims' civil rights. 

'The people who live in the inner city 
in Cleveland, the black people in this community, feel that this was an 
assault on the whole community,'  Paul Cristallo, an attorney representing Russell's family, said at the time of the shooting.

After the families of both victims and civil rights groups demanded a federal investigation, the U.S. Justice Department launched a review of Cleveland police policies in March over the possible use of excessive force by officers.
