Arrested: Lahcen Ikassrien, pictured, was arrested by Spanish police yesterday. He is a former Guantanamo inmate who was arrested in Afghanistan in 2001

Spanish police have arrested 10 men who are suspected of jihadist activities relating to Iraq and Syria - include a former Guantanamo Bay inmate.

Lahcen Ikassrien, a Moroccan, is part of the group arrested in dawn raids across Spain yesterday morning.

The men are being held on suspicion of recruiting men to fight for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), which is fighting a bloody sectarian war in the north of Iraq.

Ikassrien was arrested in 
Afghanistan in 2001 and held at Guantanamo Bay. He was extradited to 
Spain in 2005, but was acquitted for lack of evidence a year later.

The
 National Court said today that all of the men would appear in court 
soon. Eight of the arrested men are Moroccans, one is an Argentine and 
one a Bulgarian.

Three men have also been arrested in Germany over their links with terror groups

In
 Berlin, prosecutors' spokesman took in a 30-year-old suspected of 
'supporting a terrorist organization' by fighting in Syria for the 
group.

The man, a 30-year-old Frenchman, was taken in by police on Saturday.

It is thought the suspect, who wasn't named because of German privacy laws, was 
wounded in fighting. He is thought to have been arrested shortly after 
arriving in Germany from Istanbul.

He is also thought to have appeared 
in ISIS propaganda videos. Courts will decide in the coming weeks 
whether or not to extradite him to France.

In custody: Then men - eight of whom are Moroccan - are suspected of helping recruit extremists to join ISIS

Arrests: A spokesman for the Spanish courts said that the men would face trial soon

A French government spokesman yesterday said the suspect is 'dangerous and susceptible of acting on French soil.' The
 statement said he was arrested upon arrival from Istanbul.

German police also arrested a 
27-year-old German woman at Frankfurt Airport on Thursday, and a 
17-year-old German in Stuttgart on Friday. Both are being linked to 
Islamist extremist groups.

Police
 in Spain believe 50 Spaniards are fighting with ISIS and other jihadist
 groups in Syria and others in Iraq. They also hinted that other arrests
 are possible.

A court will decide on his extradition to France in the coming weeks.
