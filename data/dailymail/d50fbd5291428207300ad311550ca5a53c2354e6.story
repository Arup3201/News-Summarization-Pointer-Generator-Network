Lewis Hamilton conjured an impressive qualifying lap to claim his first pole position for eight races ahead of the Italian Grand Prix.

Since last starting from top spot on the grid in Spain in May, Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg has claimed six poles in seven grands prix, whilst Hamilton has endured a catalogue of woes.

But in a straight fight around a power circuit such as Monza, it was Hamilton who blew everybody out of the water - finishing more than a quarter of a second faster than Rosberg as Mercedes clinched their seventh front-row lock-out of the campaign.

Thanks for your company today and be sure to join us for tomorrow's race in Monza. Until then, good afternoon.

Italian GP Grid: 1 Hamilton; 2 Rosberg; 3 Bottas; 4 Massa; 5 Magnussen; 6 Button; 7 Alonso; 8 Vettel; 9 Ricciardo; 10 Perez

Rosberg is two tenths adrift of Hamilton after his final RUN despite going faster in the final sector. That means Lewis Hamilton will start from pole for tomorrow's race. What a stellar opening lap that was from Hamilton. Turn One should be a tasty affair tomorrow.

So, after the first runs, Hamilton is ahead of Rosberg, Bottas, Massa, Button, Vettel, Alonso, Magnussen, Ricciardo and Perez. We've got three minutes remaining.

And Hamilton goes fastest by FOUR TENTHS; surely that will be a time which will prove hard to beat? The British driver is looking very handy here. Rosberg is quicker than Hamilton in the first sector, but Hamilton has the upper hand elsewhere.

1:24.552 from Nico Rosberg and that's fast enough for provisional pole... but Hamilton is flying - some three tenths up on his team-mate in the middle sector.

Sergio Perez is the first driver to lay down a marker: he posts a 1:26.230.

Here we got then... the battle for the top 10 commences.

Rosberg is bidding for his fifth straight pole; something which hasn't been done since Sebastian Vettel in 2011.

So, who do you fancy to be on pole? Hamilton or Rosberg? Hamilton or Rosberg?

Lewis Hamilton ends the session quickest with Rosberg just 0.040secsbehind his team-mate.

But in front of the tifosi, Raikkonen crashes out of qualifying. The Finn made errors on both of his timed laps, and he could manage only 12th.

Raikkonen locks up heading into turn one, and then runs wide at the chicane, so he eases off the gas to save the tyres and prepare for one final shot. He's on the bubble in 10th so you'll fancy he needs to improve on his time.

There are three minutes to run and Magnussen, Kvyat, Vergne, Hulkenberg, Gutierrez and Sutil face elimination from Q2 if they can't improve on their times.

The Briton emerges from the Mclaren garage and he pops in the fastest time of the weekend. He is then urged to get a move on so he can go for a second run.

And Nico Rosberg storms to the top of the timesheets. He is over 1.5seconds quicker than Kvyat. Here comes Bottas... what can the Williams driver do? He goes second, two tenths off Rosberg's time.

Ten minutes left to run and only two timed laps: Kvyat leads the way... but Rosberg is on a flyer...

The German posts a 1:31.488 which is a long way short of where he wants to be. He'll run again...

Hulkenberg, in his Force India, is the first driver to take to the Monza circuit. Skies are blue, the sun is out and the track is clear.

Hamilton will be pleased to be back at the top of the timesheets, but the Briton must make it count in Q3. An impressive display from both Williams men. They have to be considered as serious challengers to Mercedes here.

Both Lotus, Marussia and Caterham drivers are out of the session and that's the first time both Maldonado and Grosjean have failed to progress to Q2 since the season opener in Australia.

The Lotus pair look to be in trouble here. Both Maldonado and Grosjean occupy the bottom six with less than a minute of Q1 to go.

After a scruffy lap, Hamilton responds to leapfrog Massa and Rosberg and return to the top of the timesheets, one tenth or so faster than his Mercedes team-mate.

Jules Bianchi, Adrian Sutil, Max Chilton, Kamui Kobayashi and Marcus Ericsson are heading for the exit while the Lotus of Romain Grosjean is yet to set a time... but just as I write that, the Frenchman leaves the pits.

'That was a pretty shocking lap', says Hamilton as he fails to improve his time.

Rosberg on the other hand does go quicker, and he bumps Massa down to second. But the championship leader is only 0.035sec quicker than the Williams man.

And Massa does lay down a marker in Monza as he posts a 1:25.528 to head the timesheets with eight minutes of Q1 remaining.

Williams have looked handy all weekend, and Felipe Massa splits the Mercedes duo as he pops into second. He is less than a tenth off Hamilton's best time.

Could the Grove-based outfit spring a surprise today?

Fernando Alonso gives the tifosi something to cheer about as he heads to the top of the lap charts, but he is soon eclipsed by Rosberg who is more than six tenths quicker than the Spaniard... but here comes Hamilton... and, boom, the Briton is faster than the pair of them.

And we're up and running in Monza. Rosberg, who was battling a gearbox issue, is among the first drivers to take to the track. Sterling work from the Mercedes team there. Hamilton is out on the circuit, too.

Hamilton embraces his dad Anthony before stepping in the car.

A pivotal qualifying session for the Briton today - he hasn't been on pole for 118 days.

There is more than a little suggestion that this could be Luca Di Montezemolo's final grand prix as Ferrari president.

Indeed, there is talk the iconic F1 figure could be gone by the middle of next week.

The 67-year-old is in the paddock this weekend and he popped into the Ferrari garage to give Fernando Alonso a hug... and it looked as though he enjoyed it.

If an when there is something to say about if I am staying I will make an announcement.'

Following the drama with Hamilton and Rosberg, Daniel Ricciardo’s second straight win – following his Hungary triumph – was somewhat lost.

'He has been remarkable,’ says his boss Christian Horner. ‘We have been there to capitalise on the misfortunes at Mercedes, but you still have to be there and deliver and Dan has been fantastic at that.’

Ricciardo is 64 points behind Rosberg leading to some suggestions he might yet capture either of the Mercedes’ men.

‘We are a long way behind but we are just going to go for it,’ said Horner. ‘The more pressure we can put on Mercedes more mistakes tend to happen so the objective is flat-out with both of them.’

The Italian Grand Prix has been won from pole 11 times in the last 14 years, making it more important than Monaco, which has only been won from pole nine times in the same period.

After what happened at the Belgian Grand Prix, I took a lot of time to reflect on the events of the weekend. I have since apologised to everybody that I can; starting with the fans because they wanted to see a battle with Lewis and that did not happen. I have apologised to my team, and to everybody involved with the team. I have also apologised to Lewis...

The Briton, whose deal with Mercedes expires as the end of next season, has held tentative talks with the team he left in 2012.

You can ready more on that story here...

Rosberg encountered a gearbox problem in final practice this morning meaning he missed the entirety of the session. Lewis Hamilton meanwhile, was quickest.

'We had an electronic problem on the gearbox which normally we can solve,’ said Mercedes boss Toto Wolff.

‘The guys are working hard and hopefully we can get it ready in time. Not running light fuel before qualifying isn’t perfect but he is very experienced. He was in the debrief, and he knows how the car will behave… he will manage.’

A fortnight on from their collision in Spa, Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg will resume their title back in qualifying for tomorrow's Italian Grand Prix.

Rosberg has accepted fault for the crash on lap two of the Belgian Grand Prix, and he was subsequently punished by Mercedes with a six-figure fine.

He has apologised to the team, Hamilton and the fans - who booed him on the podium, too.

For Hamilton, he has been cast 29 points adrift of Rosberg, and you get the feeling he must outscore his team-mate in Monza if he wants to win this championship
