For the past 10 years, Chelsea have been investing heavily in youth development and it would seem Roman Abramovich's big spending is finally starting to bear fruit. 

From Premier League first team down to Under-18 level, Chelsea are topping every table. 

While Jose Mourinho's side sit seven points clear at the top of England's top flight, the Chelsea youngsters are following suit at Under-21, Under-19 and Under-18 levels while fighting for FA Youth Cup and UEFA Youth League glory. 

The Chelsea first team are currently seven points clear at the top of the Premier League

Diego Costa has scored 17 Premier League goals for Jose Mourinho's side this season

Starting with the first team, Mourinho's side are well on course for a first Premier League title since 2010 as they look to fight off competition from defending champions Manchester City.

With a seven point advantage and 13 games remaining, Mourinho will fancy his chances at bringing silverware back to Stamford Bridge. 

Summer signing Diego Costa has been a revelation, scoring 17 Premier League goals since his £32million move while former Barcelona and Arsenal star Cesc Fabregas has slotted seamlessly into Chelsea's midfield.   

Despite a 2-1 defeat against rivals Manchester United last week, Chelsea's Under-21 side are currently joint-top of the domestic youth league sitting ahead of United and Southampton thanks to a superior goal difference.

The squad is packed full of promising young English talent with the likes of Roben Loftus-Cheek, Isaiah Brown and Dominic Solanke helping the young Blues to bag 25 goals in just 12 games so far.

Mourinho was so impressed with Loftus-Cheek and Brown that he decided to promote both players to the Chelsea first team in February, handing the former his Premier League debut in the 1-1 draw against City last month.

Many of the players involved were part of Chelsea's FA Youth Cup and Under-21 Premier League title double last season which seems to have instilled a winning spirit amongst the group. 

As well as domestic success, the Blues fledglings cruised through the the UEFA Youth League last 16 with five wins in six games against Schalke, Sporting Lisbon and Maribor.

Solanke played a starring role scoring seven in the European competition while Brown has bagged six and winger Jeremie Boga has chipped in with four.

Chelsea now face a last 16 clash against FC Zenit St Petersburg later this month.  

The west London club's Under-18 squad are currently 13 points clear of the Barclays Premier League south group.

Tammy Abraham, who has been at Chelsea since the age of eight, has been on an astonishing run of form in front of goal scoring 18 league goals in 14 appearances.

The same squad also qualified for the FA Youth Cup semi-final on Monday night after a 3-0 extra-time victory against Newcastle United at St. James' Park thanks to late goals from usual suspects Brown, Solanke and Abraham.

The win meant holders Chelsea  reached their sixth successive FA Youth Cup semi-final
