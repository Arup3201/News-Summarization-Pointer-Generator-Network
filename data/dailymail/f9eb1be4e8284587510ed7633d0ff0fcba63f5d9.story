Two bungling armed raiders who fled an attempted robbery empty handed and were chased down the road by customers after pointing a gun at a cashier have been jailed.

Luke Carty, 27, and Jason Dalton, 26, were captured on CCTV bursting into a petrol station in Coventry during the attempted raid last August.

The hapless pair were later caught when detectives found their clothes dumped nearby which contained their DNA.

Jailed: Luke Carty (left), who was captured on CCTV pointing a gun at the cashier, was sentenced to six years and seven months behind bars, while look-out Jason Dalton (right) was jailed for six years and four months

In the 30-second CCTV video released by police, Carty is seen pointing a gun at the cashier's chest while demanding he hand over the takings from the till while Dalton stands as a look-out by the door.

Incredibly, the cashier refused to hand over the money and the pair fled the BP garage empty-handed.

The garage worker and two brave customers then chased the men for half-a-mile but lost them when they disappeared behind the nearby Craven Arms pub.

Officers from West Midlands Police later discovered a hoodie and T-shirt used by Carty as a makeshift mask.

Acting as look-out: Dalton, 26, is seen standing nervously by the entrance to the BP garage

DNA taken from the clothing returned a match to both men and on September 12 last year they were arrested after officers spotted them acting suspiciously around parked cars.

Both initially denied being involved in the armed raid with Dalton, of no fixed address, claiming he'd lost the T-shirt on a drunken night out.

But they later admitted attempted robbery and possessing an imitation firearm at Coventry Crown Court.

On Friday Carty was jailed for six years seven months while Dalton was handed a six year four month prison term.

Detective Constable Stephen Phillips said: 'This was an audacious armed robbery in the middle of the day.

Fleeing: The men desperately scramble out of the door empty-handed after being refused money

'We suspect the handgun was an imitation but clearly the cashier wouldn't have known that in the drama of the situation.

'The staff member was exceptionally brave and gave chase while relaying details to police with a swift 999 call.

'Dalton and Carty managed to escape but crucially we seized clothing used during the attack - and it proved their downfall because forensics analysts returned a DNA hit pointing to them as the offenders.

'These are dangerous men who have rightly been handed lengthy jail sentences.'
