The pilot who died in a tragic accident aboard Virgin's SpaceShipTwo has been identified.

Michael Alsbury, a father of two and pilot with Scaled Composites, was killed on Friday when SpaceShipTwo exploded just minutes after it detached from its mother ship, WhiteKnightTwo.

Michelle Saling, Alsbury's widow, told MailOnline, 'I have lost the love of my life. I am living in hell right now.' 

The identity of the other pilot, who was critically injured when he ejected from the plane at 45,000 feet, is still unknown. 

Alsbury, 39, had piloted SpaceShipTwo as recently as August 28.

Addressing the media at the crash site on Saturday morning, Virgin CEO Richard Branson said, 'This is a very tough time for all of us at Virgin Galactic, The Spaceship Company and Scaled Composites, and our thoughts remain with the families of the brave Scaled pilots, and all those affected by this tragedy.'

He added, 'In testing the boundaries of human capabilities and technologies, we are standing on the shoulders of giants. Yesterday, we fell short. We will now comprehensively assess the results of the crash and are determined to learn from this and move forward together as a company.'  

Branson then closed out his statement by saying, 'I truly believe that humanity’s greatest achievements come out of our greatest pain. This team is a group of the bravest, brightest, most determined and most resilient people I have ever had the privilege of knowing. We are determined to honour the bravery of the pilots and teams here by learning from this tragedy. Only then can we move forward, united behind a collective desire to push the boundaries of human endeavor.'  

Branson also said he had never met Alsbury before, though photo and video evidence of the two celebrating a successful run in April 2013 seems to suggest otherwise. 

The two are seen clearly talking and posing for photos in video released by Virgin Galactic, making the blunder that much more embarrassing for Branson and his team. 

Past meeting: Oddly, Branson said he had never met Alsbury, even though the two can be seen talking and celebrating following a flight in April 2013

Branson flew to the site of the crash immediately after the tragedy occurred on Friday, and has been working closely with authorities to try and determine what went wrong during Friday's flight. 

Even though Richard Branson claims he had never met him, Michael Alsbury was one of the biggest contributors to the man's dream of sending people into space from the beginning. 

Alsbury had flown numerous missions on SpaceShipTwo for years, including the all important first successful rocket-powered run in April 2013. 

He was also the pilot in the first glide flight back in 2010, and flew as recently as August 28 of this year.

In video from the 2013 mission, it is clear what a humble man Alsbury was, and just how dedicated he was to his job. As Branson and Virgin Galactic exec George Whitesides proudly talk about all they have accomplished, and how 'jazzed' they are with the success of the run, Alsbury and fellow pilot Mark Stuckey say nothing and seem to avoid the spotlight, this even though they had just accomplished the remarkable feat of piloting SpaceShipTwo as it broke the sound barrier. 

Speaking with MailOnline, neighbor Leonard Alvarez said of Alsbury, 'He’s one of a kind, very, very special, an incredible individual who everybody liked.'

He added, 'Mike was just an incredible human being and my friend. He was a kind, unselfish man and I’m going to miss him. Everybody here will miss him.'

The 39-year-old leaves behind two children, a son and a daughter, and his wife Michelle Saling.

Said Alvarez, 'They are the perfect, ideal family, great neighbors and great friends. It is very sad.'

In a blog-post en route, Branson wrote: 'I am writing this as we refuel on one of the most difficult trips I have ever had to make. I will be in Mojave soon to join the Virgin Galactic and Scaled Composite teams involved in the SpaceShipTwo flight test program.

'Mojave is also where I want to be – with the dedicated and hard-working people who are now in shock at this devastating loss... We’ve always known that the road to space is extremely difficult - and that every new transportation system has to deal with bad days early in their history.'

He concluded: 'Space is hard - but worth it. We will persevere and move forward together.' 

In a press conference Friday afternoon, George Whitesides, chief executive of Virgin Galactic, said; ‘Our primary thoughts at the moment are with the crew and families and we are doing everything we can for them now.'

'Space is hard, and today was a tough day. The future rest on hard days like this.'

Stuart Witt, who is in charge of the Mojave Air and Space Port, where SpaceShipTwo was launched Friday, also remained optimistic about the future of space travel.

He said: 'Stay the course. This is not easy. If it was easy it would not be interesting to me and my colleagues standing next to me.'

‘We are doing this for you and your generation. It is a cause far greater than any one of us singularly. I compare it to the Magellan expedition [the first circumnavigation of the Earth].’

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has also launched an investigation into the crash.

In May, Virgin Galactic announced it was switching the fuel used in the vehicle's hybrid rocket motor, hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene, a form of rubber, to a polyamide-based plastic.

During a media tour of Virgin Galactic's Mojave facilities on October 4 that marked the tenth anniversary of the final flight of SpaceShipOne, the suborbital vehicle that won the $10-million Ansari X Prize, company officials said they expected to resume powered test flights 'imminently' once qualification tests of the new motor were done.

At the International Symposium for Personal and Commercial Spaceflight in Las Cruces, New Mexico, on October 15, Virgin Galactic chief executive George Whitesides said the company had completed those qualification tests.

'We expect to get back into powered test flight quite soon,' he said. 

SpaceShipTwo has been under development at Mojave Air and Spaceport in the desert northeast of Los Angeles.

SpaceShipTwo is carried aloft by a specially designed mothership and then released before igniting its rocket for suborbital thrill ride into space and then a return to Earth as a glider. 

Ticket cost: The starting price for flights is $250,000 (£150,000) - the first ceremonial flight will be undertaken by Richard Branson and his family. 

Training: Passengers are required to go through a 'Pre-Flight Experience Programme', including three days of pre-flight preparing onsite at the spaceport to ensure passengers are physically and mentally fit to fly.

Once aboard: SpaceShipTwo will carry six passengers and two pilots. Each passenger gets the same seating position with two large windows - one to the side and one overhead.

A climb to 50,000ft before the rocket engine ignites. Passengers become 'astronauts' when they reach the Karman line, the boundary of Earth's atmosphere, at which point SpaceShipTwo separates from its carrier aircraft, White Knight II. The spaceship will make a sub-orbital journey with approximately six minutes of weightlessness, with the entire flight lasting approximately 3.5 hours.The spaceship accelerates to approximately 3,000 mph - or nearly four times the speed of sound

The space ship is 60ft long with a 90inch diameter cabin allowing maximum room for the astronauts to float in zero gravity.

Flight frequency: Initially one per week, eventually to have two flights per day. 

Branson’s big project has also attracted a slew of big name passengers happy to pay for this once in a lifetime experience, including newlyweds Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie; Justin Bieber and his manager Scooter Braun; Lady Gaga, who plans to try and sing in space; former pop star Lance Bass, who has long been vocal about his desire to head to space; Ashton Kutcher, who was the 500th customer to purchase a ticket; Tom Hanks; Bryan Singer; and Princess Beatrice, who would be the first royal in space and who dates Dave Clark, an executive at Virgin Galactic. 

Russell Brand also got a ticket for his birthday from ex-wife Katy Perry when the two were married. Perry bought a ticket as well so Brand would not have to go alone.

Stephen Hawking and Kate Winslet are also set to fly, but got their seats for free. Winslet because she is married to Branson’s nephew, Ned RocknRoll, and Hawking because Branson wanted to offer the legendary astrophysicist a chance to go into space.
