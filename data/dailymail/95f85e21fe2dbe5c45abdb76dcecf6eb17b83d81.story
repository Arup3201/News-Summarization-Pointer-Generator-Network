Some 54 years after stealing several newspaper racks, a U.S. Navy veteran has sent a letter of apology and a check for $200 to The Ledger of Lakeland, Florida.

Bernard Schermerhorn says he's followed the rules for most of his 73 years, but caved to peer pressure as a teenager and went along with a friend's scheme to steal several racks from The Ledger.

In a Sept. 30 letter to the newspaper, Schermerhorn says they took a handful of change and then dumped the racks.

'I wish to now return many times over the cost of six newsstands and the few papers, also the amount of approximately $10 in small change,' he wrote to The Ledger.

'The fact that he talked me into going along with the idea doesn’t in any way lessen my responsibility for what we did collectively,' Schermerhorn added.

Schermerhorn, who lives in Le Mesa, California, told the newspaper the check would more than cover the damage and theft of about $10.

He said he had no specific moment that made him send the money, but had long wanted to repay the debt.

'I just got to thinking about it, you know, and thought, ‘Hey, send them the money.’' he told the paper. 'It’s just not right to not pay it back. I thought about it many times over the years.'

Publisher Kevin Drake says he's sending Schermerhorn a thank-you letter and will donate the money to a children's charity in Lakeland. 

'I appreciate his honesty and desire to make things right,' Drake told his reporterss. 'Our country would be much better off if there were more people like him who took responsibility for their own actions.'
