Almost an entire Devon village is set to be put up for sale for a rumoured asking price of more than £10million.

Evans Estates, which owns land, buildings and the popular surf beach at picturesque Bantham in South Devon, is going on the market in spring 2014. The entirety of the estate - which also includes land and properties in Wales and Dorset - is being sold for £35million.

Locals in the seaside village, where almost all the residential properties are owned by the estate, received letters last week confirming that the village and its surrounding land will be put up for sale. The village, which has 25 homes, a pub, a harbour and a shop, has been gripped by uncertainty since the sale was announced.

A village for £10million: One of the largest family-owned estates in Britain is set be put up for sale

'Obviously there is huge uncertainty and anxiety in the village, with many of us worrying about whether we will lose our homes,' said Barbara Tucker, who is a tenant of Evans Estates, one of the largest family-owned estates in Britain, and runs Bantham village shop with her husband Kevin.

'We can only hope and pray that the new owners will be sympathetic to the locals.

'Many people here have lived in Bantham for 60 years or more, with some tenancies being passed down through several generations of the same family.

'Whoever buys it needs Bantham in their heart and that's unlikely to be the case if it's bought by a big clueless investment company.

'For all we know the new owners could bulldoze the village down and build high-rise flats or turn it into a Butlins.

'Some of the houses are used as holiday homes but the tenancies have been passed down through generations and so the tenants know the village and people very well.

'Generation after generation of families have lived here - it's a very special and close little village.'

Locals in the seaside village received letters last week confirming that the village and its surrounding land will be put up for sale. The Devon-based section of Evans Estates is said to be worth more than £10 million

The Devon-based section of Evans Estates is said to be worth more than £10 million. It includes extensive farmland, houses and the beach itself at Bantham, which overlooks the famous tidal island of Burgh.

The
island inspired Agatha Christie when she wrote And Then There Were 
None, as well as the Hercule Poirot mystery Evil Under The Sun.

Bantham is home to around 25 houses, a pub, a village store, a famous beach and a farm with acres of farmland overlooking the harbour and Avon estuary.

Around 60 residents live there, most renting detached cottages from Evans Estates Limited, a private, family-owned company that was founded in 1956.

Many residents also work for the estate, maintaining its breathtaking beach, harbour and public footpaths.

Privately-owned homes nearby cost around £350,000 on average but can fetch upwards of £1.5million.

The estate at Bantham has been in the same family for several generations.

Its website states: '[Our] ethos has always been to allow Bantham to remain a place of outstanding beauty, with the village’s old thatched cottages portraying an image of unchanging charm and the beach and its surrounds staying as wild and natural as can be.

'Evans Estates has consistently set its face against commercialisation of the beach.'

Rod Seymour, landlord of The Sloop Inn in Bantham, which is owned by a brewery and not part of the sale, said Evans Estates had been responsible and well-liked landowners over the years and would be greatly missed.

'They have always run the beach with an eye to keeping it very natural and unspoilt, and supported local businesses and families. We are very concerned that a new owner may not share the same attitude.'

Mrs Tucker said that Bantham 
villagers are planning to set up a committee to deal with the estate’s 
land agents, Michelmore Hughes. 'Many of our leases and tenancy 
agreements are very old and different from each other, so sorting it all
out would be a real headache.

'We’ve
heard rumours for the past eight months that we could be up for sale, 
now it’s confirmed we just want to know what will happen to us. Even 
though we don’t own our houses, they are our homes and we love it here.'

Mr
Tucker added: 'We don't have a clue why they're selling. I suspect (the
executors) had their reasons, but they are not going to say much.'

Rosemary Jeffery, 79, has rented a cottage in Bantham with her husband for 52 years and sells vegetables to locals.

She said: 'All the residents received letters confirming the plans last week, but that's all we've heard. Nobody knows a huge amount about it but most of the villagers are feeling worried about it.

'The main worry will be how the estate is run by the new owners as it has been owned and run by the same family for such a long time and it works.

'It's a very tight-knit community as it's so small.'

She added that many of the locals have a preferred buyer in mind: 'We are used to millionaires coming to visit here as it is so picturesque. Richard Branson is a regular visitor and we could certainly do worse than have him as our new owner.

'But our real fear is we will be sold to a faceless financial institution who will not care about Bantham at all.'

The Exeter office of the prestigious estate agency Strutt and Parker is conducting the Evans Estates sale, although it will not go on the market until May.

A spokesman said: 'We're not doing anything until next year. It's true it will be sold and rumours have been flying around.

'The executors have made a difficult decision to sell it.'
