Wigan have announced that rising star Joe Burgess will leave the club at the end of the 2015 Super League season and join Sydney Roosters.

The 20-year-old winger, who burst onto the scene in spectacular fashion in 2014, is out of contract with the Warriors this year and the club have failed to persuade him to sign a new deal.

'We did everything we could but he wants to experience the Sydney lifestyle,' Wigan's football general manager and director Kris Radlinski told a fans forum at the DW Stadium on Thursday night.

Widely regarded as one of the hottest properties in the game, Burgess played and scored against the Roosters in the World Club Challenge clash at the start of last season in Sydney.

Wigan-born Burgess, who came through the club's junior system, scored 23 tries in his first full season of Super League, including the Warriors' only touchdown in their Grand-Final defeat by St Helens in October.

He went on to earn a place in the England squad for the 2014 Four Nations Series, celebrating his 20th birthday on the flight to Brisbane, but was a non-playing member of the squad.

Burgess, who has been handed Wigan's number five jersey for the new season, will be the latest high-profile player to switch from Super League to the NRL.

Seven members of the 24-strong England squad plied their trade in the NRL in 2014, including former Wigan full-back Sam Tomkins, and they have since been joined by former Hull KR hooker Josh Hodgson.
