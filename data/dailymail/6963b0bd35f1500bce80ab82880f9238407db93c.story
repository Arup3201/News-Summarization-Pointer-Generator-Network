This well-trained cat certainly seems like she was born to purr-form.

Robert Dollwet from Australia filmed his pet tabby Didga - short for didgeridoo - obediently performing the rollover trick besides her two rottweiler friends.

When instructed, the fluffy animal lays down before stretching out and rolling over. 'Good puppies,' Dollwet humorously says, admiring the feline's canine-like traits.
