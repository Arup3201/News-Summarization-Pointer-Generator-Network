The Midlands were wracked by an earthquake today - the biggest the region has felt in 13 years.

The quake, rated 3.2 out of 10 on the Richter scale, hit at 7.07am and was felt up to 28 miles from the epicentre in the Melton Mowbray area of Rutland.

However, it was not powerful enough to cause any damage.

The earthquake hit at Melton Mowbray shortly after 7am this morning but could be felt as far afield as Wellingborough, 27 miles away

British Geological Survey (BGS) seismologist Davie Galloway said: 'It was quite widely felt but we probably get about three of these at this size somewhere in the UK each year.

'There was a 4.1 in Melton Mowbray in October 2001 - so this is the biggest in the region for 13 years.'

Within half an hour of the quake striking, the BGS had received around 140 calls from people who had felt the tremors.

According to the BGS, an earthquake has to reach a magnitude of 4.5 before it can be expected to do any damage. Emergency services have not reported any casualties or damage to property.

Among 
those who felt the tremor was former English rugby union player Austin 
Healey. He tweeted: 'We've just had an earthquake in Oakham. The house 
was shaking for about 10 secs.'

Louise Warren, 40, was getting four year-old son Adam ready for school when it struck.

Ms Warrwen,
 of Stamford, Lincolnshire, said: 'The shaking sound started quite 
suddenly and my electric toothbrush fell from the shelf into my sink.

'It felt like a lorry going past my house but about ten times louder. There was a second shake soon after the first one stopped.

'I wasn't too scared because I remember when we had a tremor here about eight years ago.

'My
 son was a bit frightened because he'd never felt anything like it 
before. But he's a boy, so he did think it was pretty cool.'

Sara Dodd, who is in Whissendine, tweeted that it 'felt like an explosion but without any sound.'

Another resident - identified as Ali W - wrote on Twitter: 'It was different to the last one... A massive bang rather than a shake.'

She added: 'I even thought a train had crashed at the back of us.'

Dr John Park wrote: 'What the hell was that. Whole house shook about 7.07am! It was either an explosion or earthquake in Rutland. Anyone else feel it?'

Kerry Rough tweeted: 'Woke me up. I thought the house was falling down.'

Mr Galloway said: 'It has nothing to do with fracking. We record about 200 earthquakes and it is to do with the earth's dynamic plates moving, probably about the pace of the growth of a fingernail.

'The most common reports we have had is that houses shook, windows rattled for quite a few seconds, people were quite alarmed. Another comment was that it felt like a lorry was trundling along the road or there had been a crash but no one has reported cracking in their houses.

'We do not get the big earthquakes like they would get in places like Japan.'

Police and the emergency services have reported no damage or casualties.

The biggest earthquake in the UK was the 5.4-magnitude tremor which hit the Lleyn Peninsula in Wales in July 1984. In a close second place is the 2008 quake that shook Market Rasen, Lincolnshire and was measured at 5.2
