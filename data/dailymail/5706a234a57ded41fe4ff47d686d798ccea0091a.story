Jose Canseco and fiancee Leila Knight's engagement went kaput over the weekend and the fall out was so dramatic, police were called to the former MLB star's Las Vegas pad to get things under control.

Leila Knight, a self-described model, actress and pro poker player, told TMZ Sports on Monday that she called 911 after Canseco, 50, freaked on her for wanting to end things.

'[He] threatened to kill me and my mother,' she said. 'Like 20 times.'

The claims come just a month after the infamous slugger fired a bullet that blew off one of his fingers and narrowly missed then-fiancee Knight.

Kaput! Jose Canseco and fiancee Leila Knight called this off over the weekend--with each blaming the other for the break up--one month after canseco blew off his own finger with a pistol

'He's an an a**h***!' she told TMZ. The swimwear model also took to twitter to vent her frustrations toward her former love.

'So happy to be single again. Took me a long time to use my brain instead of my heart,' she tweeted.

She also posted on Sunday: 'My ex just threatened to kill me and my mom over and over and over and the cops came over. Can't wait to hear all the lies on his end.'

Will one of those lies be that it was his idea to break things off all along? Because that's precisely what Canseco is now claiming.

The one-time MVP tells TMZ that he, in fact, was the one who called things off, not Knight.

'She's slandering me because I don't want to be with her,' Canseco told TMZ. 'I fell out of love with her because she's too controlling.'

And just to show how serious he is, Canseco went on to tweet: 'Tmz I am ready for a polygraph.'

All told, its been a long a convoluted last few weeks for the duo.

The former MLB slugger, and admitted doper, severed his left-hand middle finger last month when his handgun accidentally misfired at home while he was cleaning the firearm.

Doctors reattached the digit, but last week the 50-year-old announced on Twitter that the limb had fallen off and that he planned to sell it on eBay, along with his flashy gun.

Now he says the story about the finger falling off in the middle of a poker tournament was all part of an elaborate joke he devised after seeing a fake finger for sale in a Halloween shop, TMZ reports.

Canseco's lighthearted attitude about the painful injury is marked change from last month, when he broke down in tears about the incident to Inside Edition.

Describing what happened, he said: 'At first I heard it go off and I actually grabbed the gun and put it on the table.

'(I) thought nothing had happened. Then I look at my hand and my finger’s blown off.'

Canseco explained the bullet only narrowly missed Knight who was standing nearby. She quickly ran to his aid.

'I was telling Jose not to look at his hand because he kept saying that he felt nauseous and said he was going to pass out,' Knight told Inside Edition. 

Healing: 'She's slandering me because I don't want to be with her,' Canseco said . 'I fell out of love with her because she's too controlling' said Canseco

Turned out to be a joke: Doctors reattached the digit, but last week the 50-year-old announced on Twitter that the limb had fallen off and that he planned to sell it on eBay, along with his flashy gun
