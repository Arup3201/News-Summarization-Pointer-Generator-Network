An inspection report which failed the first privately-run NHS hospital made at least 200 errors, the watchdog has admitted.

The Care Quality Commission last month declared Hinchingbrooke, Cambridgeshire, was inadequate, with the lowest ever patient care score.

That same day, Circle, the private firm running the exemplary hospital, pulled out of its contract.

But there are growing suspicions the inspection was a stitch-up, heavily influenced by Labour figures and other individuals who oppose privatisation.

They include an inspector who was a member of Keep Our NHS Public and another who had warned of the dangers of private firms’ involvement in the NHS.

Yesterday, CQC chief David Behan admitted to the Public Accounts Committee that the report contained about 200 inaccuracies, from false allegations against staff, and mistakes in data about care, to basic but sloppy typing errors.

Committee member Stewart Jackson, Tory MP for Peterborough, described the CQC as a ‘lynch mob’. He asked Mr Behan: ‘What is it, a used car salesmanship? It is supposed to be a proper regulatory body. This is why one of your own staff admitted it was a lynch mob … you should be ashamed of yourself.’

He added: ‘Are you fit for purpose for judging an organisation which in May 2014 was winning awards … whereas within four or five months your report, based on anecdotes, some might say tittle-tattle, rates it as inadequate and one of the worst inspections the CQC has ever undertaken?’

The MPs were told some of the report’s most serious allegations were in fact misunderstandings by the watchdog.

In one instance, an inspector claimed to have heard an A&E doctor shouting abusively at a patient. It later transpired the doctor was speaking loudly to the man because he was profoundly deaf.

A student nurse criticised by the CQC for telling a patient ‘you know what happens when you misbehave’, was found to have been sharing a joke with him to make him feel more comfortable so he would eat.

Senior Circle managers told MPs they had found 300 inaccuracies in the report. The CQC has since admitted to about two thirds of these but has refused to change the ‘inadequate’ rating.

Hisham Abdel-Rahman, chief executive of Hinchingbrooke, said he had asked the CQC to provide written notes to back up its allegations but it has so far failed to do so.

The hospital will now be put back in the hands of the NHS. But it is deemed unprofitable and there are fears it will be closed or taken over by a larger hospital.

It has also emerged a senior NHS manager who oversaw the flawed contract for Circle’s takeover walked away with a £400,000 pay-off. Sir Neil McKay was chief of the Midlands and East Strategic Health Authority when the deal was signed in 2011.

But in 2012 when the authority was abolished he received £465,000 in redundancy pay with a pension pot valued at £2million. MPs heard he is still being paid by the NHS as he has set up a consultancy advising organisations in the Midlands.

There are growing suspicions the inspection of Hinchingbrooke Hospital, in Cambridgeshire, was a stitch-up, heavily influenced by Labour figures and other individuals who oppose privatisation

Following Circle’s takeover in February 2012, Hinchingbrooke’s A&E waiting times and those for cancer patients were among the lowest in the NHS.

Patient satisfaction scores went up and in May last year it was rated the top hospital in the country by healthcare data monitors CHKS.

But an investigation by this newspaper last month revealed the deal may have been doomed from the start as members of the local NHS body opposed privatisation. The Clinical Commissioning Group slashed the hospital’s finances and imposed arbitrary fines. Two members are Labour activists, including chairman Maureen Donnelly, formerly a senior TUC member.

There are concerns the report was heavily influenced by the opinions of anti-privatisation inspectors – including Dr Jonathan Fielden, previously a senior member of doctors’ union the British Medical Association, who had warned of the dangers of privatisation.

Another inspector, Dr Nigel Sturrock, had been a signed-up supporter of Keep Our NHS Public since its launch in 2005.

The CQC has since said it will force inspectors to disclose links to organisations which may distort their opinions.
