While most spy planes try to stay under the radar, this unknown military drone has apparently been spotted by Google Earth.

The photo, making the rounds on various blogs, shows what looks like a large aircraft covered in a white tarp next to an F-16 at a Lockheed Martin facility in Palmdale, California.

The facility is reportedly the home of Skunk Works, Lockheed Martin's Advanced Development division.

Speculation has grown about what exactly the unknown craft is since OSGEOINT put up the photo last week. It can still be seen on Google Earth today.

OSGEOINT suggested in a blog post last week that the craft could be 'anything from a mock-up to a failed design.'

The aviation blog FlightGlobal.com reported that the drone looks similar to a P.420 - a craft that Lockheed Martin patented in 1997, but has never been seen.

Aviation reporter David Cenciotti told Wired.com’s Danger Room blog that the drone appears to be a Sentinel drone that he believes to be 'damaged.'

Skunk Works did not return a call by 
MailOnline for comment, but in a statement to AOL, spokeswoman Melissa 
Dalton said: 'Lockheed Martin Skunk Works often experiments with 
different shapes and materials for both manned and unmanned vehicles.

She added: 'What you see in the satellite image is one of those projects'

OSGEOINT said the picture was taken on December 4, 2011.

That date’s significant because it was the same day another U.S. drone apparently malfunctioned and crashed in Iran. That RQ-170 and the mystery craft have similar designs.

The unknown drone appears to have a larger wingspan.

Wired reported that that the drone looks to be about 60 feet wide from wing to wing.

Skunk Works has been around since World War II, when it designed the XP-80 jet, nicknamed the ‘Lulu-Belle,’ in 1943.

The company was mostly been shrouded in secrecy until the 1990s, when it emerged that it was tasked with building the successor to the space shuttle.

However, that project, the X-33, was nixed in 2001.
