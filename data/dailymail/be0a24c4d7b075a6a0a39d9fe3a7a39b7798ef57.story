The new United States away kit for the World Cup in Brazil has caused uproar among fans, with critics comparing the shirts to the French flag.

Designed by Nike, the jersey features three different-colored bands, starting at the top with blue, white, and red to represent the American flag, according to a company press release. The away kit also includes red shorts and red socks.

However, fans have taken to Twitter to express their disapproval -- and many are comparing the new jerseys to the French flag, as well as those of the Netherlands and Russia.

Not the response expected: Fans on Twitter have questioned whether the new USA away strip released by Nike was an April Fool's Day joke

'Is this April Fool's? Trying to look like France?' one user wrote.

'Away US soccer kit is alright but reminds me of France, Russia, Dutch. Not American and neither is that lighter blue! #USMNT' another tweeted.

'The new #usmnt jersey is basically the flag of France upside down...way to screw it up Nike,' one said.

'Wanna see the new #USMNT jerseys?  Google "Netherlands Flag"' another user wrote.

The famed French flag features panels of blue, white, and red going from left to right. The Dutch flag, however, features panels of red, white and blue going from top to bottom.

The new away jersey has even been compared by USA Today to frozen popsicles.

Despite the bad reception the kit received from fans, captain Clint Dempsey is a fan of the shirt.

'I like the patriotic design and color scheme and I think it will look great on the pitch,' Dempsey said.  'Hopefully they will serve us well as we head into a competitive group.'

USA will need all the help they can get after being drawn in the same World Cup group as Ghana, Germany and Portugal.

Women's team striker Sydney Leroux was also supportive of the design.

'The new kits fit really well, look great and most importantly, are really comfortable, especially when we are running all over the field for 90 minutes in all sorts of different weather,' Stryker said.

Despite fans' objections, the away jerseys for three nations will look different from the ones for the USA. 

The French away jersey is white with light gray stripes. The Dutch away jersey will be blue with an orange Netherlands badge. Both teams' jerseys are also designed by Nike.

The Russian away jersey, designed by Adidas, features an outline of the earth, which looks like a series of blue stripes. A company press release says it is supposed to represent the view that Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, saw Earth in 1961.

The rest of the jersey is white, with an emblem of the double-headed eagle.

At least one fan seemed to have a hopeful approach to the new US jersey on Twitter.

'So the new USA home and away kits are absolutely terrible...but you know what makes a good kit is a kit you win in #USMNT.'
