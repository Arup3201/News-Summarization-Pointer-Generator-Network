When Ukraine's fugitive president fled for an unknown destination, he left behind his sprawling luxury estate in Mezhyhirya, an hours drive from Kiev.

The people of the country, who earn on average earn between £2,400 and £4,200 a year, flocked to see Viktor Yanukovich's hastily vacated property.

What they found stunned them. The property in Mezhyhirya, is packed with riches well beyond the reach of a man with an official salary of less than £15,000.

Sculptures worth millions, statues, a white Steinway piano, gold-plated taps, towel rails and other fixtures, chandeliers everywhere, valuable paintings and elegant glass and tableware. He even had personalised bottles of fine brandy featuring a photo of his smiling face.

The property also boasts a golf course, helicopter pad, cinema room and a garage filled with classic sports cars worth millions, while in the exotic gardens Australian and African ostriches stretched their legs.

Graeco-Roman statues - a Goddess covering her modesty with her hair, lovers intertwined - decorated the lawns. Ornate ponds - half frozen on Saturday - nonetheless bubbled with water being pumped through them. Love-seats and colonnaded meeting places dot the estate.

There is a Russian bath-house and on a hilltop, looking down on the Dnipro river through trees, is a plaza for a barbecue. A replica of a ship also sits on a lake.

Most of the visitors shook their heads in wonderment at the ambitions of a president who had always proclaimed that he was on the side of the poor people of Ukraine.

Yesterday the lavish estate of the Ukraine's ex-prosecutor-general Viktor Pshonka was exposed as another example of the extravagant homes the country's former leaders and top officials enjoyed living in.

With Pshonka reportedly having fled the country, the photos show the exterior and interior of the home, in the village of Gorenichy outside the capital Kiev. A Reuters photographer said that with Pshonka gone, journalists and people entered the house to inspect it.

The scale of the opulence of homes used by public officials is seen by opposition activists as proof of large-scale corruption among the country's elite, one of the key causes of public anger which led to the protests in Kiev and other cities.

Documents recovered from Yanukovych's presidential home that reportedly show evidence of widespread corruption have started to appear online.

Journalists and volunteers have been analysing the papers after divers retrieved them from the lake at the sprawling estate in Mezhyirya.They say the documents show how millions was lavished on construction, furnitures and animals.

Lesya Ivanova, one of the journalists, told Euro News: 'Some documents were collected from the surface of the water, others were retrieved by the divers.... we had to unfold and dry them immediately to preserve the information.'

The papers are being uploaded to the purpose-built website Yanukovychleaks.org.

Journalist Oleksandr Akymenko said: 'These documents are very valuable. They could help prove corruption schemes used by Viktor Yanukovych personally, his team and his inner circle.'

Russia today claimed that the CIA could be behind the disappearance of Yanukovych.

The official newspaper of Vladimir Putin's government alleged that American intelligence may have secretly flown the disgraced tyrant - now accused of mass murder - to a new life after giving him personal guarantees if he left the political stage.

The extraordinary claim in Rossiyskaya Gazeta will inevitably be seen as a smokescreen for similar suspicions that Russia is now shielding former ally Yanukovych, possibly at the headquarters of the Black Sea fleet in Crimea.
