Amanda Knox and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito are anxiously waiting to find out if their acquittal for the murder of a British student will be overturned by Italy's highest court.

Supreme Court judges will rule on Monday on whether there should be a retrial regarding the death of Meredith Kercher or if the case against them should be closed completely.

In 2011 Knox and Sollecito were cleared of the 2007 murder on appeal after they had initially been found guilty and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively.

Meredith, 21, was found semi naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom in the house she shared with American Knox in the picturesque Italian hill top town of Perugia.

The case made headlines around the world amid allegations of sex games, drugs and jealousy during their first trial in 2009.

Victim: Student Meredith Kercher, 21, was found murdered in the picturesque Italian town of Perugia

Knox and Sollecito were found guilty but
 were cleared two years later after a fresh hearing uncovered a bungled 
police investigation.

Defence lawyers and experts revealed how evidence had been contaminated or poorly handled by forensic teams and that the conviction should be considered unsafe.

They were immediately freed with Knox returning to her home in Seattle while Sollecito went back to Bisceglie on the southern Italian coast near Bari.

Prosecutors in Perugia appealed the decision on behalf of Miss Kercher's family and will find out on Monday if they have been successful.

They want the acquittal to be quashed and for a new trial to be held in neighbouring Tuscany.

Neither are expected to attend the hearing which will be held behind closed doors in Rome.

The case will decided purely on paperwork and legal documents with no new witnesses giving evidence.

Luciano Ghirga, Knox's lawyer, said: 'She is very anxious about the hearing but she is waiting for it knowing full well that the outcome is very important.'

Since returning to Seattle in the United States, Knox has kept a low profile although she is due to given an interview to ABC television on April 30 to coincide with the release of a book about her four years in an Italian jail.

Still in touch: Raffaele Sollecito said he and Knox are no longer lovers but still talk occasionally via Skype

Sollecito has also written a book and has already given an interview on Italian TV about the case where he said he and Knox were no longer lovers but they were still in touch - he visited her earlier this year and they speak on Skype regularly.

He is now studying in Verona and they have always insisted they are innocent of Leeds University student Meredith's murder - she had only been in Italy for two months before she was killed having arrived from Coulsdon for a year long course as part of her degree.

Last night his father Francesco said: 'He is working hard on his studies. He's working on a project involving the movement of surgical instruments during operations. He is calm and serene even if we are all in a state of apprehension.'

During the investigation and trial much was made of Knox's character with prosecutors saying she was highly sexual and had manipulated Sollecito but her lawyers dismissed the theory.

Rudy Guede is serving 16 years for the murder having initially being sentenced to 30 but this was later reduced on appeal.
