A teacher who had sex with her 17-year-old special needs student is carrying his baby, it was revealed on Wednesday.

Kelly McKenzy Watson, 35, met the boy while she was his teacher at the residential New Haven Youth and Family Services in Vista, Los Angeles. The establishment works with emotionally disturbed boys. Their relationship apparently began in January 2012, when he was 16, after he left the facility.

Watson was ordered jailed Wednesday but she will be allowed to get out early to give birth, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune.

Inappropriate: Kelly McKenzy Watson, 34, had sex with a 17-year-old student while she taught him at the residential New Haven Youth and Family Services in Vista, Los Angeles

She pleaded guilty in November to a 
felony charge of unlawful sex with a minor but at the time, she didn't 
reveal that she was pregnant with his child.

The teenage father of Watson’s baby 
was in court for the sentencing, according to the  Union-Tribune.

Deputy 
District Attorney Mary Ellen Barrett said the boy cares for Watson and 
did not want her to go to jail. Barrett also said the boy wants to be 
involved in the life of their child.

'He is very much in love with her and is looking forward to the baby,' Barrett said.

Judge Laura Halgren gave Watson three years’ probation and ordered her to spend time in jail until her due date in April.

She barred Watson from working with 
minors in the future and ordered her to stay away from the teenager, 
though she said he could attend the baby’s birth. The judge decided not to place Watson on the sex offender registry.

When Watson was handcuffed at the end of her sentencing, the 17-year-old became emotional.
