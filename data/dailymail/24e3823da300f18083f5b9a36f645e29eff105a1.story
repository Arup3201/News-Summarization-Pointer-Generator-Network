QPR defender Rio Ferdinand wants English football authorities to consider introducing their own version of the NFL's Rooney Rule, which is designed to promote the hiring of black and ethnic minority coaches.

Last week Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Gordon Taylor said 'there is a hidden racism which holds clubs back' when it comes to hiring managers.

And Taylor wants to see the English game adopt the Rooney Rule, which is used in the NFL to ensure such candidates are adequately represented in the interview process for head coaching positions.

Rio Ferdinand has endured a tough start to his QPR career after joining from Manchester United this summer

The defender is open to a rule that promotes the hiring of more black and ethnic minority coaches in England

The NFL employs the Rooney Rule to address the issue of a lack of coaches from minority backgrounds

When asked if he thought the rule should be introduced in England, Ferdinand told the BBC: 'It is something to be discussed definitely.

'It's been used in NFL, can it be replicated here?

'In football it's a mates game, rather than your colour. It's about whether they have a relationship with you and know that they can trust you.'

Ferdinand was at the Mayfair Hotel in London last week to launch his new book #2sides 

Only two out of 92 clubs in English football's top four divisions employ a black manager after Chris Powell took charge of Huddersfield and Keith Curle joined Carlisle last month.

And asked about the state of racism in British football, Ferdinand said: 'It's hard to say.

'Football is a great tool to use but I think society is the bigger problem.

'It's about educating people. It's a long and winding path.'
