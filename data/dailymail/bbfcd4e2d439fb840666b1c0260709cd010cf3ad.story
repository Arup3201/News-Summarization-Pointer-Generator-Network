The fashion world might be obsessed with youth but it seems no one has told 75-year-old Jean Woods, who has a trendy Hoxton haircut and loves DMs.

Or Daphne Selfe, who, at 85, is the world's oldest model - and one of the most stylish, with a wardrobe cool enough to leave the likes of Cara Delevingne looking on in envy.

Or Gillian Lynne, who says she will wear mini-skirts at 87 if she wants, adding that her legs are her 'best asset'.

And they are not alone, as new Channel 4 documentary, Fabulous Fashionistas, reveals. The film follows six spectacularly well-dressed pensioners - none of whom is letting age get in the way of looking stylish.

One of the most adventurous is Sue Kreitzman, 73, who has turned dressing into an art form - quite literally.

An artist by trade, she frequently designs her own clothes, which she describes as a release 'from the tyranny of fashion'.

With her bold red frames, chunky bangles and penchant for black, she bears a striking resemblance to the fashion world's grandmother-in-chief, Rosita Missoni, another 70-something still making her mark on the fashion world.

Then there's Jean Barker, Baroness 
Trumpington, 91, a Conservative peer who has made a point of refusing to
 go quietly into the fashion night and can regularly be spotted 
intently, but stylishly, listening to debates from the comfort of the 
Lords' iconic red benches.

'She snuck in under the wire but I 
couldn’t resist because she is such a character,' says Sue Bourne, the 
director behind the documentary.

'She is terrifically well put-together and she  shops from catalogues. Actually she has a bit of an addiction to them.'

Age-defying: Gillian Lynne, 87, started working life as a dancer in the 1940s

For Bridget Sojourner, 75, it is not catalogues but charity shops that fuel her passion for fashion.

Despite subsisting on a pension of just £100 a week, she cuts a striking figure in her crimson turban and chunky jewels.

On
 her shopping list are flowing dresses vibrant scarlet and black, which 
she combines with eye-catching costume jewellery, uber-glamorous hats 
and her most recent purchase, a £4 pair of Doc Marten boots.

'Style,
 as one gets older, is more noticeable,' she explains. 'How I look is to
 do with my identity and the fun of it. It’s nothing to do with looking 
younger.'

It might not be about looking younger, but you'd never know it when looking at Gillian Lynne, 87.

A former ballerina, Lynne, who looks at least 20 years younger than she really is, exercises every day and still wears both mini-skirts and leggings.

'You just mustn’t allow the ageing process in,' she reveals.

Her other secret for eternal youth is that she is married to a man 27 years younger than her.

'My friends thought it was positively indecent when we started to see each other, but since we are still together now, how silly they look now!'

Her main gripe with women 'giving up' at a certain age is that they let their posture go.

'You
 see them hunched over, looking downward. Everything seems to sag. They 
look dejected. My training as a dancer always taught me that you stand 
up straight and get those shoulders back.

'To
 be crude about it, the nipples should lead – and how can they do that 
if they are pointing down towards the floor somewhere.'

She has no issues about wearing short skirts. Even minis are OK. 'I know people probably look at the face and go "oh dear" but my legs have always been my best asset. Why should I stop showing them off.'

It's a philosophy with which Woods can identify, although she admits that after a knee operation, mini-skirts are not for her anymore.

'Oh no. I don’t really go above the knee
 with a skirt. Once you do that, at my age, you have to start thinking 
about the scars from my knee replacement op.'

Resplendent in her favourite scarlet T-shirt and grey-checked skirt, she's got hair that owes more than a little to Mary Quant - and the attitude to match.

Widowed at 70, she filled the hole left by her husband with a job at Gap before taking herself - and her considerable styling skills - off to work at a boutique in Bath.

'I'm leading a different life,' adds Woods, who also runs three times a week, despite having had her knee replaced. 'It's more adventurous.'

With her sharply cut fringe and penchant for Doc Marten boots, Jean Woods is no one's idea of a frail old grandmother - and the glamorous septuagenarian says she has absolutely no intention of changing.

'I have always been interested in fashion, but more so as I have got older,' explains Jean. 'I like to dress as I want to dress. When I put something on, I don't think "will anybody think I look good?"

'I just decide in my own mind whether I look good - I don't really care about other people.'

Jean became Gap's oldest employee six years ago and has gone on to work at many of the big high street names, including current employer Bloomsbury & Co.

She says young people are impressed with her look and don't have any issues with her buying similar clothes to them.

Jean hopes her TV appearance will help to persuade older people than life doesn't stop the day you pick up your pension.

'If it shows older people that life is there for the grabbing and that you have to take that plunge, then I will be happy,' adds Jean.

'I don't think youngsters think about it in the same way. When I go into Topshop, they are used to seeing me now and just accept that I am buying their clothes.'

One of Jean's two sons, Alec, 49, said the whole family supports her fashion-savvy style. He said Jean's grandchildren, who are all in their teens, regularly ask their grandmother for tips on how to look cool.

Alec said: 'She has always dressed like that, so to us it doesn't look any different. The kids accept the way she looks as normal, but when their friends come round they say "I wish my gran could dress like that".

'We all know that the way she dresses, and her personality, means she stands out.'
