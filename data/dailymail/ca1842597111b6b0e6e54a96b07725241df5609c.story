Medical staff who helped stop a gunman from killing more people at a Pennsylvania hospital on Thursday have been been hailed as heroes.

Dr Lee Silverman, who police say may have been the intended target, and caseworker John D'Alonzo, were able to quickly stop Richard Plotts after he shot dead their co-worker.

The 49-year-old, who has a history of mental illness, was attempting to reload his gun when Silverman fired several shots, and D'Alonzo wrestled him to the ground.

Attack: Richard Plotts was shot three times by a doctor after he shot dead his caseworker on Thursday

District attorney Jack Whelan gave new details Friday about the terrifying encounter in an office next to Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital in Darby.

The attorney told ABC News that Silverman began firing at Plotts, who had just killed his case worker Theresa Hunt.

Using a chair to shield himself from attack, Silverman fired at least 10 times at Richard Plotts, using a gun he carried with him for protection.

He managed to hit Plotts three times - twice in the chest and once in the arm - despite being injured himself. 

The doctor was shot in the hand and a bullet grazed his head, but Silverman continued to fire at Plotts until his gun was empty. He then managed to escape the office.

A second case worker, John D'Alonzo, also heard the shooting and, finding the office door blocked, climbed through a window to try to stop the gunman.

Whelan described D'Alonzo's actions as 'nothing short of heroic' and told ABC News: 'If it wasn’t for [their] heroic actions ... we believe [Plotts] was going to reload that 
revolver and continue to fire.'

Plotts is currently sedated and under guard. When he is no longer sedated, the patient will face an arraignment on charges of murder and attempted murder.

On the day of the shooting, the 49-year-old had arrived early for an appointment, with a concealed weapon.

Whelan said a motive was not yet clear, but added: 'He intended to kill Dr Silverman and that's why he brought the gun.'

Plotts is also facing weapons charges because he did not have a license for the gun.

Police said Plotts has a lengthy history of gun arrests, violence and mental health 
problems. They say he had 39 bullets on him after the shooting.

'There were some issues between the doctor and the patient, but whether or not he actually feared him is unclear,' Whelan said.

His victim, 53-year-old 
Theresa Hunt of Philadelphia, had accompanied Plotts to the psychiatric 
crisis center at Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital in Darby, just southwest of 
the city, authorities said.

Police in Upper Darby
 were aware of at least three mental health commitments involving Plotts
 — once after he cut his wrists and once when he threatened suicide — 
but said such stays can last just one to three days.

Plotts had also been barred from at least 
one residential shelter because of his violent history, Upper Darby 
police Superintendent Michael Chitwood said Friday.

'The
 case workers and the doctors and the catchment centers - they know who 
violent individuals are, because they're frequent fliers. And the system
 is not geared toward keeping these people housed somewhere until they 
start to be better. So you put whole communities at risk,' Chitwood 
said.

Plotts may have been 
angry with Silverman over his treatment plan, Whelan said. Colleagues 
heard arguing during the appointment and saw Plotts aiming a gun at 
Silverman when they peaked inside the door. They quietly backed out and 
called 911. The shooting soon began, just before 2:30 p.m.

Hospital
 policy bars anyone except on-duty law enforcement officers from 
carrying weapons on campus, a Mercy Health System spokeswoman said. She 
otherwise declined to discuss the reports that Silverman was armed at 
work.

'We remain focused on 
working with the Delaware County Police Departments to understand fully 
the details of the event,' said the spokeswoman, Bernice Ho.

Yeadon Police Chief Donald Molineux said that 'without a doubt, I believe the doctor saved lives.'

'Without
 that firearm, this guy [the patient] could have went out in the hallway
 and just walked down the offices until he ran out of ammunition,' the 
chief said.

Both guns were 
recovered from the scene. The exchange of gunfire occurred on the third 
floor of the Wellness Center at Mercy Fitzgerald, a 204-bed community 
teaching hospital.

There
 are no surveillance cameras in the doctor's office or the waiting area 
outside, and no metal detectors at the entrance, authorities said.

Cathy
 Nickel, a neighbor at Plotts' last known address, an apartment complex 
in Upper Darby, saw a caseworker move him out of the building about a 
year ago. As he was taken away in a van, she said, he yelled, 'You 
haven't heard the end of me!'

A spokesperson for the hospital released a statement, saying: 'We continue to pray for the victims and their families.

'We are thankful for the responders to this incident, the many law enforcement professionals who are a part of the investigation, and the outpouring of support we have received from our community.'
