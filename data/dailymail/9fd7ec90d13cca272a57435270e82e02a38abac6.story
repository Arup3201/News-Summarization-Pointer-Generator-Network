A man and a 14-year-old boy have been arrested on suspicion of raping a teenager at the Reading Festival.

The 19-year-old woman told police she was attacked in a caravan in the traders’ area last night, after meeting a man and a boy near an ice cream van in one of the campsites.

Police reassured festival-goers over the incident, which happened as 90,000 fans poured into the Berkshire site for three days of music headlined by Arctic Monkeys, Blink-182 and Paramore.

The 14-year-old boy, from Surrey, was being held by Thames Valley Police today on suspicion of rape alongside a 31-year-old man from London.

The alleged victim was being cared for by specially-trained officers, and the caravan in question was sealed off for forensic tests after the alleged attack at 11.30pm yesterday.

'We are investigating a report of rape that took place on the grounds of Reading Festival last night,' said a police spokesman.

'At around 11.30pm, the victim, a 19-year-old woman, met a man and a boy near an ice cream van opposite one of the mobile phone charging points in one of the campsites.

'The victim reported that she had subsequently been raped in a caravan on the festival traders' site.

'A 31-year-old man from London and a 14-year-old boy from Surrey have been arrested on suspicion of rape and are currently in police custody.'

Chief Inspector Dave Parker added: 'We take all allegations of this nature very seriously and we are conducting a full investigation.

'A man and a boy were arrested very soon after the report was made, thanks to the quick response of on-site security and Thames Valley Police officers.

'There is currently a scene watch in place and I would like to reassure those attending the festival that crime levels remain low and crimes of this nature are very rare.

'Officers are patrolling the site to support on-site security and if anyone has any concerns, please feel free to approach our officers to discuss these.' 

Police are patrolling the site and said there have been 21 crime reports since the gates opened on Wednesday, including five alleged drugs offences and 13 suspected thefts.

Mr Parker said: 'I know many people will be celebrating their A-level and GCSE results and officers are working to make sure this is a safe environment in which to have fun.'

Aside from Glastonbury, Reading is one of Britain's oldest and best-known music festivals.

It launched on its current site near the town centre in 1971 after emerging from the National Jazz Festival, and focuses on alternative and rock music as opposed to the folk roots of its Somerset rival.
