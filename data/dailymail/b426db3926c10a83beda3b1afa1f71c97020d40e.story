Staff at a bakers that was forced to close after the bin lorry crash in Glasgow which killed six people were told their wages would be docked if they did not turn up for work. 

Greggs in George Square in Glasgow was at the centre of a police cordon after the crash and was unable to open the next day. 

But staff working at the bakery claim they were told if they did not turn up for work the day after the tragedy and agree to work at a different store, they would lose money. 

Staff at Greggs bakery in George Square in Glasgow claim they were told their pay would be docked if they did not work the day after the bin lorry crash, when their store had to be closed because it was in the cordon 

A worker at the bakery, who did not want to be named, said: 'The day after the crash the shop here was closed and staff were told of they didn't go to another shop they would not be paid.' 

Six people were killed and 10 injured when the truck, with a driver and two colleagues on board, mounted a pavement packed with Christmas shoppers near George Square on December 22.  

The bin lorry hurtled through a busy junction, ramming a taxi, just seconds before it crashed into the Millennium Hotel in Glasgow's George Square.

Teenager Erin McQuade and her grandparents, childhood sweethearts, Lorraine and Jack Sweeney, from Dumbarton, were killed in the crash. Jacqueline McQuade, mother to Erin, is believed to have gone to take out money from a cash machine during the Christmas shopping trip when her 18-year-old daughter and parents were struck by the out-of-control bin lorry.

Primary school teacher Stephenie Tait, 29, tax officer Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh, who worked in the hospitality industry were also killed. 

A spokesman for Greggs said the company had paid staff in full for the day of the crash and when it became clear the shop would be unable to open the following day, because it was in the police cordon, offered them the chance to work at other shops. 

He said:  'We offered alternative work in our other Glasgow shops to ensure staff did not lose pay for the day but we recognise that this was not a suitable option for everyone and have now taken steps to ensure there is no loss of pay for those who elected to go home instead.' 

The store opened its doors after the crash for the emergency services after the tragic crash in December. 

After the deaths Archbishop Philip Tartaglia said that Glasgow was now 'reeling from this latest sad and sudden tragedy'.
