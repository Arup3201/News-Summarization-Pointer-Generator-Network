Sick yobs pulled hair from a pony's mane and tail before callously pushing it into canal to drown.

The horse's lifeless body was examined in the freezing waters in Rugby, Warks, by shocked RSPCA inspectors at the weekend.

Because the carcass was still warm the charity says the helpless animal was probably alive when it was pushed in the Brinklow to Newbold canal.

Drag marks on the tow path have led investigators to believe that the pony's drowning is suspicious

The distressed pony is believed to have struggled desperately to save itself as investigators discovered drag marks leading to the waters edge.

The RSPCA has urged anyone with information to get in touch after they were contacted by dog walkers who made the grim discovery.

The pony had died by the time it was found on Saturday, but the RSPCA think it may have still been alive when it was put into the water and could have struggled desperately to save itself

The RSPCA is appealing for help to find the sick people who dumped a live pony in a canal

The stretch of water was opposite a lay-by, and a dark Range Rover was seen in the area at around 7am that day

Inspector Louise Labram said: 'At the moment I am treating this as suspicious.

Clumps of mane and tail hair were discovered in the lay-by leading to the towpath

'The soil is really disturbed in places which could mean the pony had been alive and had been struggling.

'There were also clumps of mane and tail hair in the lay-by and drag marks leading to the towpath.

'It is awful that a pony has just been dumped in this way and distressing for anyone who sees the body.

'We have informed the relevant authorities asking them to remove the pony - as we don't have the statutory responsibility nor the resources to dispose of bodies.'

The stretch of water was opposite a lay-by, and a dark Range Rover was seen in the area at around 7am on Saturday.
