Three men arrested on Saturday over the death of Drummer Lee Rigby last week have been released on bail

Police with machine guns stormed three separate addresses in simultaneous raids across south-east London between 6pm and 6.30pm on Saturday.

On the Lamb Estate in Greenwich, officers in balaclavas charged in to a first-floor flat and used a Taser on one suspect.

They arrested a Somali man and another unarmed man, both in their 20s.

Officers from the Met's Counter 
Terrorism Command supported by specialist firearms officers raided a 
separate fourth-floor flat 300 yards away, believed to be the home of 
relatives of the Somali.

The two men suspected of murdering 
Drummer Rigby, who have been identified as Michael Adebolajo, 28, and 
Michael Oluwatobi Adebowale, 22, remain in a stable condition in 
hospital, police added.

Peter Clarke, former head of counter 
terrorism at Scotland Yard, said that he believed Adebolajo and 
Adebowale were part of a bigger terror network.

‘Clearly these people this week 
weren’t lone wolves,’ he told Sky News. ‘We know that they associated 
with other people with a similar way of thinking and the thing is that 
underpinning everything they do, there is an ideology.

The dramatic daytime arrests by police wearing 
balaclavas means there are now six terror suspects being held over the 
death of Drummer Lee Rigby

‘So when you are attacking a network,
 you are attacking an organisation or structure but when you’re looking 
at individuals, you have to understand how far they have been poisoned, 
how far their actions have been influenced by the pernicious ideology 
that violent extremism has.’

The potential existence of a terror 
cell may not have been spotted before because it did not plan a large 
attack like the failed airline bomb plots of 2006, experts said.
Witnesses said they leapt out of a silver car and a white van near Highbury Corner around 2.45pm.

The man was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder and last night was being questioned.

One witness, who did not wish to be 
named, said: ‘The guy was on a push bike when the police came out of 
nowhere and wrestled him to the ground.’

On Saturday afternoon armed officers in balaclavas leapt out of an unmarked van and raided a flat in Greenwich, south London.

Meanwhile, two people have been 
arrested on suspicion of arson after a fire was discovered shortly 
before 10pm yesterday at the Grimsby Islamic Cultural Centre, in Weelsby
 Road.

The fire was extinguished and no one was injured, Humberside Police said.

Drummer Rigby was hit by a car and 
then attacked with weapons including a knife and a meat cleaver but the 
cause of his death has not been confirmed by a post-mortem examination.

The
 young father's murder has provoked a backlash of anger across the 
country, with many incidents of mosques being attacked, racial abuse and
 comments made on social media.

Drummer Rigby had survived Taliban 
bombs and bullets during a tour of duty as a machine gunner in 
Afghanistan, only to be slaughtered on the streets of London.

On Saturday his family paid tribute to the soldier they described as their 'hero'.

'Lee's dream growing up was always to join the Army, which he succeeded in doing. He was dedicated and loved his job,' they said in a statement.

Drummer Rigby's wife Rebecca, mother of their two-year-old son Jack, said through tears that he was 'a devoted father'.

Along with the floral tributes at the corner of John Wilson Street and Artillery Place where the attack took place, many hundreds more have been left outside the entrance to Woolwich barracks a few hundred yards away, where Drummer Rigby was based.

A book of condolence has been opened at Woolwich Town Hall, where opening hours have been extended over the bank holiday weekend to allow the public to pay their respects.
