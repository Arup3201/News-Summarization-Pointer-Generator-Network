Residents in Peoria, Arizona, are outraged after police shot dead a young mountain lion that appeared in a neighbors backyard.

The skinny cat wandered up to the family's back door and stared through the glass with hungry eyes on Tuesday evening as they sat down for dinner.

Rebekah Coleman's family were taken by surprise by the feline and she told ABC15.com: 'He showed no fear at all. I think he was ready to do whatever it took to find a meal.'

Hungry eyes: The mountain lion wandered up to the back door of Rebekah Coleman's Arizona home while her family were eating dinner

'He had big ears, saucer-sized paws and empty green eyes', she added.

But after lingering around her door for a few minutes, the hungry mountain lion jumped over Coleman's eight-foot fence to her neighbors backyard.

The Arizona Game and Fish Department and police were called by a local resident and AGFD gave permission for officers to shoot the animal if needed.

When officers cornered the lone cat, it attempted to flee the area and Peoria police shot it dead.

Several residents in the area did not think it was necessary for the cat to be killed and has prompted outrage in the neighborhood.

Melora Nivienne wrote on Twitter: 'So tragic: A terrified young mountain lion was brutally gunned down,w/the consent of @azgfd.'

Another Twitter user, Allison, posted: 'Sad to hear that Peoria police shot and killed a mountain lion. Of course it was aggressive - it was probably scared.'

Randy Babb from the AGFD told ABC: 'When you have a cat out in daylight acting odd like this, that's a big red flag.

'They're the things we always look for in disease cases - to see if the animal is behaving oddly.

'Often times when you get an animal that strays into a neighborhood, we will capture it and remove it.'

In this case they did not attempt to capture the animal and Mr Babb says the mountain lion might have had rabies.

'Some of these animals will not display rabies for over a year, even though they're carrying the disease.'

Mr Babb says he supports the authorities decision to kill the animal and said it was a potential threat to residents.

Residents say they've seen bobcats before in the area but not mountain lions.
