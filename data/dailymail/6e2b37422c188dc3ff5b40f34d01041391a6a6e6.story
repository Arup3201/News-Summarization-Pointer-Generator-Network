British women are happiest with their breasts at the age of 26 - and cite Holly Willoughby’s cleavage as the curves they most covet, according to a new study.

The research found women ideally want a D or DD cup - which explains why the shapely This Morning presenter, who boasts a 34DD chest, has the country’s most envied breasts.

Half of the nation’s women would gladly pay to have them for themselves, with 20 per cent willing to fork out £3,000 to enhance their cleavage.

The study, carried out by Ultimo Beauty into women’s views on their assets, found women are most happy with their breasts in their mid-twenties, with 38 per cent saying that was when they were most satisfied.

A wistful 28 per cent of women admitted they thought theirs were best during their teenage years. 

And the research suggests British 
women rate their boobs most highly when they hit 26 - like Abbey Crouch 
and actresses Gemma Arterton and Lindsay Lohan.

One
in seven (14 per cent) claim they were at their best in their thirties 
but it would generally seem things start heading south after women hit 
their late twenties.

Indeed, 35 per cent of women say the biggest concern about their chest is sagging boobs.

Cheryl Cole, 29, who says she’s a 32D, came second to 31 year old Willoughby when women were asked whose chest they most wanted.

Meanwhile, one in seven British women 
(14 per cent) said they would be more than happy with breasts like 
princess Kate Middleton.

When asked about the appeal of her 
breasts in 2008, Willoughby, now a mum of two, said: 'We’re so used to 
seeing size zero figures that people freak out when they see curves.

'I’m a 34D/DD and I’d never have a boob job.

'Good underwear’s the key. I buy firm scaffolding to make sure everything’s secure and safe.'

The research found that Hollywood star 
Marilyn Monroe still has the most iconic cleavage, ahead of former 
Wonderbra model Eva Herzigova.

Michelle
Mone OBE, founder of Ultimo Beauty, said: 'Holly Willoughby has 
naturally gorgeous boobs which are envied by women up and down the UK.

Throughout my career I’ve seen that women like a natural curvy shape and Holly has a fabulous figure that she shows off so well.

'Most women have a particular boob concern, especially as time takes its toll.

'Sagging is by far the number one concern
for the nation. Throughout my career I have seen a shift from women 
wanting big boobs to wanting toned boobs.

'This also comes at a time when the nation’s cup size is steadily increasing.'

The survey of 1,000 UK women found the average bra size is now a large D cup, edging towards a DD.

However, 40 per cent of women say they wish their boobs were bigger. In contrast, 28 per cent wish they were smaller.

One in 33 of those surveyed (3 per 
cent) said they have had implants, and another 27 per cent admitted they
would consider a boob job.

Women
are so desperate to have perfect boobs, that 16 per cent said they 
would be prepared to dump their partner in order to have a pair like 
Holly Willoughby.

Women 
voted 34 year old glamour model Katie Price’s pneumatically enhanced 
breasts the worst in Britain. She was followed by bodybuilder Jodie 
Marsh.
