Noel Edmonds's hit tea-time TV show Deal or No Deal may be forced to air after the 9pm watershed amid claims it constitutes gambling.

The Gambling Commission is expected to warn Channel 4 that the programme could be breaking the law because it does not involve an element of skill. Non-skill games played for profit require a gambling licence.

ITV's Red Or Black?, presented by Ant and Dec and developed by Simon Cowell, is also said to be under investigation.

Producers of Noel Edmonds' hugely successful Deal Or No Deal on Channel 4 have been shocked to be told by the Gambling Commission that their £250,000 jackpot games could be breaking the law

The shows could be subjected to tight 
restrictions on the type of advertising broadcast during breaks and the 
amount of pre-broadcast publicity.

They could even be forced to obtain a licence costing £60,000, and £30,000 to renew every year.

Meanwhile ITV plans to revive Bruce
Forsyth’s perennial hit Play Your Cards Right have also been put on ice pending
the outcome of the probe.

It is against the law to run non-skill games for
money without a gambling licence – raising the extraordinary prospect of
producers being jailed if they defy the warning.

Channel 4
may then decide it would be simpler to cancel Deal Or No Deal, than be constrained by so
many restrictions.

The programme, which has been presented by Edmonds since it
was first broadcast in 2005, regularly attracts an audience of more than four
million in its afternoon slot.

Viewers watch as contestants guess which of 22
identical sealed boxes contains the show’s elusive jackpot in what programme
makers Endemol say is a contest of ‘instinct, gut feeling and luck’.

As boxes
are opened, contestants decide whether to accept a cash offer from the
mysterious Banker, or play on in the hope of increasing the offer, while
running the risk of receiving a much lower prize.

However, a Government source
told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The Gambling Commission does not seem to think that
there is any skill element to the show.

‘Even though at the beginning of the
show, contestants do not have to stake any of their own money, the argument is
that once they’ve picked a box, which could contain a lot of cash, in
subsequent rounds they are in effect gambling with their own money,’

Separately, the Commission is also understood to have raised issues over Red Or
Black?, where contestants win £1 million on the spin of a wheel.

The Commission
has told the programme makers that the participants need to show more skill in
winning the top prize to escape the need for a gaming licence – which would
mean the end of the crucial roulette wheel. Regulators are also said to be
concerned about the way the show ‘glamorises’ gambling.

ITV's Red Or Black?, the £1 million a-night game show presented by Ant and Dec, and developed by Simon Cowell, is also understood to have been hit by the investigation

The Mail on Sunday also
understands that ITV is shelving plans to bring back the popular Eighties quiz
show Play Your Cards Right, in which prizes are determined on the turn of a
card, for the same reason.

Last night the move was met with bewilderment among
game show bosses, who argue that rules created to control casinos and illegal
betting should not be applied to entertainment programmes.

One senior
broadcasting source, who has been fighting the probe behind the scenes, said:
‘This is an absolutely ridiculous state of affairs. 

‘The Gambling Commission
has no right to be poking its nose into what are harmless television
programmes.

'How can anyone regard Deal Or No Deal as gambling?

'It is probably
the most innocent show on television. I think its very telling that this
programme is aired in 30 different countries but only in Britain has this
become an issue.

‘You also have to look it from the point of broadcaster. They
are already heavily regulated by Ofcom. Why on earth would they want to also
come under the control of the Gambling Commission as well?

'Surely Noel Edmonds isn't that frightening'

'That means they
would be answerable to two different regulators who would be looking into its
affairs. The people who make Deal Or No Deal want to operate as a television
production company not a casino.’

Simon Cowell’s spokesman, Max Clifford, said:
‘Simon wants to come up with the most exciting combination he can which remains
within the rules. His view is that it is a light entertainment programme with a
gambling element – not what the Commission is claiming.’

As well as
restrictions on scheduling, advertising and trailers, any TV company whose
shows fell under gambling rules would also need to prove to the Commission that
its executives had an understanding of the complex laws and regulations
surrounding the betting industry. This could force them to team up with a
gambling company in order to employ the relevant expertise.

The expert said:
‘The gambling industry is the most stringently regulated industry in the UK
because of the capacity for high level organised crime.

‘The Gambling
Commission wants to make sure these shows are not enticing people to go out and
gamble recklessly, and some programmes may fall into this category in their
current format.

Red Or Black? was launched in a blaze of publicity by ITV and Simon Cowell’s SycoTV production company last September.

With a £15million budget it was the most expensive game show ever devised – and producers assumed it would be a ratings smash.

However, it struggled to find an audience and, five months on there are doubts whether the show will ever return to the screen.

Producers are understood to be locked in talks with the Gambling Commission about whether the show can return in its existing format or whether it needs to be revamped.

One suggestion is that the show’s roulette wheel, which decides whether contestants leave as millionaires, may not return.

The row over gambling is the latest controversy to hit the show, which was devised by Cowell personally.

Last year, it emerged that Nathan Hageman, the winner of the show’s first £1 million prize, had a conviction for assaulting a woman, sparking demands for the prize to be withdrawn.

Three other contestants were subsequently pulled out of show and at least one of these had a criminal record.

Cowell had hope the show would replicate the success of his other programmes including Britain’s Got Talent and the X Factor.

Its opening night audience of almost seven million was respectable, but did not come close to the ten million which had been predicted. Subsequent episodes would attract less than four million viewers.

The show also controversially provided a showcase for some of Cowell’s music acts, including X Factor winner Leona Lewis.

ITV has still yet to announce a second series but the broadcaster and Syco are in talks.

Last night, ITV insisted that its return had not been delayed by the Gambling Commission.

A spokesman said: ‘A decision will be made on a second series of Red Or Black? in due course.’

‘If a TV company was unwilling to change the format then they
could be forced into a range of moves which would effectively kill off the show
altogether.

‘The problem is this is an extremely complex area that is in danger
of encroaching on harmless family entertainment. It will undoubtedly be a case
of compromise for the shows in question, but if the Commission aren’t careful,
we could see the end of several popular family game shows.’

A spokesman for the
Gambling Commission refused to comment, saying it never talks about
‘individual’ cases.

However, he confirmed that the Commission was about to
publish new guidance for television game shows.

He said: ‘In the first
instance, we would contact the operator to discuss the situation, as compliance
is always preferable over enforcement action.’

The Commission, which was set up
as the independent regulator under the Gambling Act 2005, is required to
keeping crime out of gambling, ensure gambling is conducted fairly and openly
and protect children and vulnerable people from being harmed or exploited by
gambling.

The spokesman declined to say how much a television company would
have to pay for a gambling operating licence.

However, based on a formula
linked to company turnover and published on the Commission’s website, a permit
would probably cost about £60,000 to apply for, with annual renewals costing
about £30,000.

Dr Mark Griffiths, professor of gambling studies at Nottingham
Trent University, said that, in his opinion, Deal Or No Deal, did involve
gambling.

He said: ‘The bottom line is, contestants in the show are effectively
gambling. The show producers will say that the people on it are not putting up
any of their own money. But once they are on it, they have been given money and
it’s their money they are gambling on.’

Dr Griffiths said that a TV show that
had to operate with a gaming licence should be moved to a later slot in the
television schedules.

‘Gambling is an adult activity so it should go out after
the 9pm watershed in my view.’

Dr Griffiths added that he had been urging the
Gambling Commission to look into television game shows for some time, saying:
‘For some years, there’s been a blurring between gambling and gaming. I am very
pleased they’re looking into this.’

Last night, a Channel 4 spokesman said:
‘Channel 4 has been contacted by the Gambling Commission about the popular long
running series Deal Or No Deal. It would not be appropriate to comment further
at this time.’

A source at the channel added: ‘People are very worried. The
producers don’t want to be tarred with the gambling brush’.

ITV refused to
comment.
