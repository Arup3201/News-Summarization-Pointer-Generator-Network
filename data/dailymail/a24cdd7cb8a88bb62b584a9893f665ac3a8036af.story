Roma brought in the likes of Ashley Cole, Juan Iturbe and Davide Astori during the summer but their latest signing may prove to be a fantastic purchase for the future.

The Italian giants have snapped up nine-year-old Pietro Tomaselli from Belgian outfit Anderlecht.

Tomaselli was rumoured to have been tracked by European giants Real Madrid, Barcelona and AC Milan before eventually deciding to move to the Italian capital.

The youngster, who has been labelled 'the new Totti', already has a lot of pressure on his shoulders as Roma have told Tomaselli's father that they think he can be as good as Diego Maradona.

His father Pino, speaking to La Gazette Belge, said: ‘We’ve been welcomed very well by the club, they think he could be better than Diego Maradna.

'Everyone knows about him already: the club president, the senior players…’
