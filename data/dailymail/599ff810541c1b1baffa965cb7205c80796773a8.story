This is the dramatic moment a protester felt the full force of the police - when she was pepper sprayed in the face.

The woman was drenched during yesterday's rally in Portland, Oregon - just one of several demonstrations across the U.S. marking the Occupy movement's two month birthday. Thousands also took to the streets in New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Boston and Washington.

It came as protesters were starting to lose the support of residents fed-up with their violence and the continual disruption of their daily lives.

What is pepper spray?

It is a lachrymatory agent - a chemical compound that irritates the eyes and causes tears, pain and temporary blindness. Also known as OC spray (Oleoresin Capsicum), OC gas and capsicum spray. Seattle activist Dorli Rainey, 84, was sprayed in the face on Tuesday.

What is it made out of?

An extract from the cayenne pepper plant, which is mixed with natural oil. It is then placed into a container and pressurised to create a spray or an aerosol. The cayenne pepper plant is better known as a very hot spice used for cooking and is also used in prescription drugs.

What are the effects of pepper spray?

Eyes tear up, forcing them to close as the capillaries dilate, and remain bloodshot for 45 minutes. Throat swells for half hour, restricting the airway - forcing victim to give up the fight - uncontrollable coughing, retching, and gasping for air with a gagging sensation in the throat. Skin becomes inflamed, with some people losing balance because of loss of vision.

When was it developed?

OC spray created in 1960 at University of Georgia. First sold as Halt Animal Repellent in 1963, before FBI authorised its use in 1989.

The use of tear gas in Oakland, California, pepper spray in Portland, Chicago and New York, and the hundreds of arrests, has shone the spotlight on the varying crowd control tactics of police.

It has also highlighted the aggression being used by some protesters.

Experts on policing have said departments are using necessary tactics to control unpredictable, sometimes violent protesters, and that the police has yet not reached the stages yet of full riot protection.

'I don't think they're rioting at Occupy Wall Street, not yet, but they are getting out of control,' said Maki Haberfeld, a professor of police studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.

She added: 'If they were rioting, you would see much more riot gear like sonic devices and high-powered weapons'.

But the images that have played across the country have been disconcerting to some.

'When somebody puts their hands on somebody itself, it never looks right,' Haberfeld said.

'But this is what they're allowed to do. It is truly not excessive and I am surprised by how not excessive it is.'

The demonstrations yesterday were for the most part peaceful.

But at least 300 people were arrested in New York and dozens were arrested elsewhere.

These included five on charges they assaulted police officers by throwing liquid into several officers' faces and tossing glass at another.

'We will assure that everyone has the 
right to exercise their First Amendment rights,' New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg
said after visiting one hospitalised officer who needed 20 stitches on 
his hand.

He added: 'But if anyone's actions cross the line and threaten the health and safety of others including our first responders, we will respond accordingly.'

Chanting 'All day, all week, shut down Wall Street', more than 1,000 protesters gathered near the New York Stock Exchange yesterday and sat down in several intersections.

Several thousand later jammed Manhattan's Foley Square and marched to the Brooklyn Bridge.

Several weeks ago, an attempt to march across the bridge drew the first significant international attention to the Occupy movement as more than 700 people were arrested.

In Seattle, hundreds of protesters marched down the University Bridge. Traffic was snarled as demonstrators from two different rallies held marches.

In Los Angeles, helmeted police equipped with batons surrounded the base of a bank tower, but the protest remained peaceful.

Several hundred Occupy sympathisers marched to the Bank of America Plaza in down town Los Angeles, with some setting up tents on a lawn.

Police arrested two dozen people after they sat down in a street during a peaceful rally by hundreds of people organized by labour groups who had a permit.

Authorities cleared an encampment set up by Occupy protesters on the University of California, Berkeley campus; with 150 police officers and deputies in riot gear.

Police arrested 21 demonstrators in Las Vegas, and 20 were led away in plastic handcuffs in Portland, Oregon, for sitting down on a bridge.

At least a dozen were arrested in St Louis after they sat down cross-legged and locked arms in an attempt to block a bridge over the Mississippi River.

Several of the demonstrations coincided with an event planned months earlier by a coalition of unions and liberal groups, including Moveon.org and the Service Employees International Union, in which out-of-work people walked over bridges in several cities to protest high unemployment.

The street demonstrations also marked two months since the Occupy movement sprang to life in New York on September 17.

They were planned well before police raided a number of encampments over the past few days, but were seen by some activists as a way to demonstrate their resolve in the wake of the crackdown.
