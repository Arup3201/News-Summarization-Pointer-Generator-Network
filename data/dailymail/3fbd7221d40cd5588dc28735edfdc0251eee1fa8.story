Javier Hernandez is adamant Real Madrid will not be fazed by the cauldron-like atmosphere that will await them at Anfield when they face Liverpool.

The Champions League holders travel to Merseyside for their Group B clash on Wednesday night with a 100 per cent record in Europe.

Liverpool's famous red-hot Anfield atmosphere has played a major part in famous European nights before but Hernandez believes the Spanish giants won't be intimidated by the reception they will face.

Real Madrid's Javier Hernandez believes they won't be intimidated by Liverpool's Anfield atmosphere

The Mexico striker, who is on a season-long loan from Liverpool's arch-rivals Manchester United, has experienced Anfield and is confident his new team-mates will quickly adapt to it, too.

'Anfield will not intimidate us.' Hernandez said.

'I have played at Anfield before, and they do have a special atmosphere. With Real Madrid coming that atmosphere will be ever more special, but the atmosphere will not intimidate us. We have World Cup winners and Champions League winners in our team - big games and big atmospheres do not affect this club.

'I want to do well and win at Anfield, but I don't have anything to prove. I did not get the chances I wanted at Manchester United, but I am getting them at Real Madrid and I am scoring goals. If you prove yourself at Real Madrid, it shows you are capable of doing it anywhere.'

Hernandez's sentiments have been echoed by Real team-mate Isco, who thinks Liverpool are in for a torrid night against Cristiano Ronaldo.

Ronaldo is the current Ballon d'Or holder and has started this season in electrifying fashion, scoring 19 goals in 12 appearances for the Bernabeu outfit this season and Isco believes no club in the world can handle him at present.

'There is no player or no team that can stop Ronaldo at the moment,' he said.

'The form he is in is not of this world. He doesn't approach games thinking he will score, he approaches them knowing he will score.

Cristiano Ronaldo will provide Liverpool's biggest threat in Wednesday Group B encounter

'I am sure Liverpool will not be an easy place to go and play, but I know that it will not phase Ronaldo.

'They are probably preparing for the threat of him, but there is no preparation possible. If they play close to him he will beat them, if they put two players on him they will beat him, there is nothing you can do to stop him.'

Despite the obvious threat of Ronaldo, Real are also aware of the dangers the hosts possess - especially in the shape of captain Steven Gerrard.

Former Real star, and now coach of their B team, Zinedine Zidane describes the former England captain as 'one of the finest midfielders of the last 10 years' and believes stopping the 34-year-old is key if the Spanish giants are to leave Anfield with at least a point.

'I would not pay any attention to the critics who say that Gerrard is finished,' said Zinedine.

'He has been one of the finest midfield players of the last 10 years.

'He knows his own body and will know he wont be able to run around like he did when he was 26, but he has more than enough intelligence to adapt his game - and sit back and control things from a deeper position.

'I still look at him as player who can control the game for Liverpool - so we have to try and stop the threat of him on Wednesday.'
