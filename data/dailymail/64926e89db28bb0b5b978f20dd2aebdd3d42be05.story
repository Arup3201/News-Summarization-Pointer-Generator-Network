Andy Murray put down his racket and picked up ladle as he served up a feast at the Dubai Food Festival.

The British No 1 was pictured helping out on a stall at the Dubai event, where they were serving 'Murray Curry'. 

The former Wimbledon champion worked with chef Sanjeev Kapoor at his Indian themed section, learning to cook a curry - something the 27-year-old claimed he had never done before.

'I have been learning to cook a curry, which I have never tried doing before and was a nice and fun experience,' Murray told the ATP World Tour's official website.

Murray is in the country for the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, for which he is seeded third.

When asked about the event, he said: 'It is an important event especially with the quality of the draw being really strong here, you need to be on your game. With Roger (Federer) and Novak (Djokovic) both having come here every year in the past six to seven years, along with the long tournament history and quality of the winners, it is an important date on the calendar for sure.' 

'I feel good, I arrived a couple of days ago and have been practising indoors these last few days and getting my body clock ready. It has been a good start to the year so far.' 

Murray will face Gilles Muller of Luxembourg in his opening match on Tuesday.
