If the biggest alcohol distributor in Australia goes ahead with industrial action, half the bars, pubs, and clubs in New South Wales could be left with crowds of unhappy customers.

Truck drivers at delivery company BevChain are expected to vote on the action on Wednesday, after negotiations over a new industrial agreement were halted.

The drivers, who are members of the Transport Workers Union (TWU), were in talks with management about pay increases and safety concerns, The Daily Telegraph report.

BevChain deliver half of the beer in NSW to licenced premises, and are a the largest alcohol distributor nationwide. They operate in five states from 14 distribution centres.

James Squire, Corona, Tooheys and James Boags are just some of the beers the company delivers, and they also have wine and spirit brands such as Brown Brothers and Bacardi under their belt.

A business partnership between Lion Nathan breweries and supply chain company Linfox, BevChain could take an indefinite strike or refuse to work overtime if their complaints are not met.

Employees are campaigning for an increase in their Super contributions and a 16 percent pay rise per year.

According to transport website Fully Loaded, earlier this month the Fair Work Commission approved an application for the drivers to hold a ballot to gauge the amount of support there was for industrial action.

'We’ve been in there trying to negotiate for a fair agreement that recognises our hard work and dedication, but it seems like the company doesn’t want to hear it,' Greg Leslie from the TWU’s negotiation team said.

The negotiations are said to have been running for as long as four months, and the company could be thrown into chaos if the drivers go ahead with a strike.
