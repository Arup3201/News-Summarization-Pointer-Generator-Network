Cleveland kidnapping victim Gina DeJesus and her parents will watch as officials bulldoze and grind to dust the house of horrors where she was kept in chains for a decade.

The city hopes to make the four-bedroom house at 2207 Seymour Street disappear, just three months after DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight were freed from unimaginable tortures inside.

The search giant Google has already 'disappeared' the house on its Street View features. Searches for the address now show just a blurred box instead of the house.

House of Horrors: The house on Seymour Street where Ariel Castro kept his victims for a decade is being torn down and ground to dust on Wednesday morning

Google has blocked the Seymour Street house from its Street View feature. It is unknown whether the search giant did that on its own or if it was asked to make the house disappear

It is unknown what will be done with the land beneath the house. The city of Cleveland seized the home and donated it to the Cuyahoga Land Bank, a non-profit organization that fights urban blight in the city.

The Land Bank has not revealed its plans for the property.

Felix DeJesus said he and his wife and daughter Gina will watch the house come down.

'Thank God it will be over with. And tomorrow I will be there to see this house come down,' he told WOIO-TV.

On July 26, Castro - a former elementary school bus driver - pleaded guilty to more than 900 counts of kidnapping, rape and assault and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Pictures emerged from inside the home of chains and restraints and makeshift alarms that that he used to keep the young women bent to his sadistic will.

On Monday, authorities allowed Castro's children to enter the home and retrieve family photos and other mementos. 

Neighbors are happy to see the house torn down.

'I want things to be like it were, quiet and peaceful. But to see that house go down it really will be a relief because I am so sick and tired of looking at it,' Henrietta Bell told the Cleveland TV station. 

The land bank's president, Gus Frangos said that the organization is trying to keep away scavengers who might try to sell the rubble as what is known as 'murderabilia.'

In 2011, a website that sells items related to high-profile crimes put on sale 1-gram packages of soil from the home of Cleveland serial killer Anthony Sowell before a city agency razed the house.

Sowell was convicted that year of killing 11 women and was sentenced to death. His case is under appeal.
