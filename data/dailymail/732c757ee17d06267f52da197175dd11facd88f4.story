The Lindt cafe in Sydney's CBD will reopen on Friday, three months after a deadly siege claimed the lives of two hostages and a gunman.

A Lindt spokesman has confirmed the Martin Place cafe would open its doors at 10am, with NSW Premier Mike Baird set to be the first customer, reports 9 News.

A plaque inside the cafe will commemorate Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson who were killed there along with gunman Man Haron Monis in December last year.

Lindt Australia CEO Steve Loane says the overwhelming feeling was to create a permanent memorial.

'It was felt this was the right thing to do, to remember Tori and Katrina and their spirit,' he said in a statement on Tuesday.

Mr Loane thanked the public for an outpouring of support since the siege.

'This has been an extremely difficult period for so many people impacted by those tragic events,' he said.

'(The support) has truly been a source of strength for everyone and has helped us in our decision to reopen the café and move forward.'

A statement from the Dawson family last month said they hope to one day return to the site.

'Although it will be difficult at first, we hope to be able in time to return to the Lindt cafe so that her children can continue to experience one of Katrina's great joys,' the statement read.

Mr Johnson's partner Thomas Zinn also spoke out about the reopening of the cafe.

'We would like for people to return to Martin Place and smile again.' .

Thousands of messages and flowers were laid outside the Lindt cafe in the weeks following the siege

The reopening comes only one month after Lindt's chief executive Stephen Loane announced plans to recommence business

The cafe remained boarded up after the terror attack until last month, when tradespeople entered to assess a new design for the store. 

Mr Loane asked the public to respect the privacy of staff and let them enjoy the job they love so much.

NSW Premier Mike Baird will be one of the first to visit the cafe, which will return to standard trading hours from Saturday onwards.
