The tributes to actor Leonard Nimoy - who passed away aged 83 on Friday from complications due to lung disease - are pouring in, including from where man once had never gone before.

Colonel Terry Virts tweeted a photo of himself performing the Vulcan salute over the window of the International Space Station overlooking the Earth on Saturday morning to mark Nimoy's passing.

Posted without a caption, Virts makes a spread V with his hand - a gesture popularized by Nimoy's character Spock on Star Trek, which was often accompanied by the phrase 'Live long and prosper.'

Just hours later, Italian-born astronaut, Sam Cristoforetti tweeted a photo of herself performing the infamous salute while looking up and donning a blue T-shirt adorned with the sci-fi series' logo.
