A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the world’s first all-electric communications satellites successfully launched this morning.

The huge 22-story tall booster took off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 3.50am GMT this morning (10.50pm EST yesterday), the third flight in less than two months for SpaceX.

On this occasion, though, SpaceX made no attempt to land the rocket again on a floating barge, as they had done previously.

On top of the rocket were a pair of satellites built by Boeing and owned by Paris-based Eutelsat communications and Bermuda-based Asia Broadcast Satellite (ABS).

The satellites are unique in that they are powered solely by ion propulsion, as opposed to chemical propellant that is usually favoured.

This has the benefit of making the much lighter, as they don’t need to carry fuel with them.

‘The value of electrical propulsion is that it allows the satellite operator to need much less fuel than when the satellite has chemical propulsion,’ Eutelsat chief executive Michel de Rosen said in an interview before launch.

Without the fuel they would normally need - hydrazine - the satellites each weighed less than 5,000lbs (2,270kg), whereas normally they would have weighed more than 8,000lbs (3,630kg) without an ion propulsion system.

This also meant both satellites could be carried by SpaceX’s medium-sized Falcon 9 rocket – had they been laden with fuel, only one could have been taken to orbit on this launch.

This also brought the cost of the launch down - Eutelsat and ABS paid around £20 million ($30 million) each to place their satellites on the rocket, as a single launch costs about £40 million ($60 million).

However, as ion propulsion - also known as Solar Electric Propulsion - is much weaker than chemical propulsion, it will take them months rather than weeks to reach their desired geostationary orbit.

‘You can have a much lighter satellite, so that, in theory, the cost of your launch is much reduced.’ 

The lighter of the two satellites, ABS 3A, will reach its destination by the end of August, while the Eutelsat 115 West B spacecraft will take a few weeks longer. 

In space, the two satellites were released one by one in opposite directions, so as to avoid a collision.

Once in their desired orbits, about 22,300 miles (35,800km) above Earth, they will be able to remain operational for at least two decades.

To get there, they will use what is called a ‘supersynchronous transfer orbit’, which involves performing a large elliptical ‘loop’ around Earth to reach this relatively distant location.

Once they reach their orbits, they will remain in one position over a particular part of the world, providing coverage to certain areas. 

Specifically, the ABS 3A satellite will connect the Americas, Europe, Africa and the Middle East.

The Eutelsat 115 West B satellite, meanwhile, will provide coverage from Alaska and Canada to South America.

Eutelsat's spacecraft will become part of a 35-member network providing a range of mobile, internet, video and other communications services. The new satellite expands the company's reach into the Americas.

ABS, which currently has six satellites, will position its new spacecraft to also serve customers in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.

The companies are partnering for a second pair of satellites that are due to launch aboard another Falcon 9 rocket later this year.

SpaceX also flies cargo missions to the International Space Station for Nasa and is working on an upgraded spaceship to fly astronauts as well.

The next SpaceX launch, which will take a communications satellite for Tukemenistan into orbit, is currently scheduled for 21 March 2015.

The two satellites are seen here before launch. ABS 3A is on the top, and the Eutelsat 115 West B is on the bottom of the payload. The latter was slightly heavier to support the weight of the former
