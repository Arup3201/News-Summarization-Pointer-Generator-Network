Channel 4 are considering celebrity options to present their Grand National coverage in April following Clare Balding’s defection to host the Boat Race for the BBC on the same day. 

Possible names include Jeremy Kyle, host of a confrontational daytime chat show that focuses on relationship feuds, and football and Formula One presenter Jake Humphrey. 

Nick Luck, the regular racing anchor in Balding’s absence, has won many awards. But he is not considered a big enough name for the Aintree showcase because the National attracts a much wider once-a-year audience than the normal racing programming.

Kyle is a racing enthusiast who has horses in training with Nick Gifford. 

But to have such a newcomer presenting the race will not go down well with Turf diehards, especially on such a prestigious occasion. 

At least Humphrey has experience of live sports presenting, though not in racing, and working on the National requires extensive knowledge of the race. 

A C4 spokesman said that no decision had yet been made on the National presenter.
