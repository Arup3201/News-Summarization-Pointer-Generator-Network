A 16-year-old girl was killed and three other teens were shot in 'an attempted robbery gone wrong' in Detroit, authorities said Wednesday.

An armed man got out of his car and approached five teenagers as they smoked marijuana in a pulled-over vehicle in the city's east side, family sources told Local 4.

The man shouted at the teens, who instructed their female driver to speed off. The man shot when the group attempted to flee, the sources said.

16-year-old Paige Stalker died though the group sped to a nearby hospital, Local 4 reported.

A 15-year-old male passenger is in critical condition; passenger Demetrius Herndon and the female driver, both 16, have been discharged; and a 17-year-old female passenger escaped being shot, according to the news outlet.

'We re-interviewed the victims and got a little bit more information, accurate information,' Adam Madera, a Detroit police spokesman, told Local 4. 'We now are working under the assumption that it possibly was an attempted robbery gone wrong.' 

Herndon told Local 4 of the shooting 'We hurried up and turned on the car and we did a U-turn, rode up some grass and hit a tree. Then, he shot the side of the car. 

'He shot the girl in the head, shot Donald in the arm and shot me in my arm.'

Remembered: Paige Stalker attended University Liggett School, was on the honor roll and played lacrosse

Earlier, Detroit Police Chief James Craig told Local 4 'We do not believe this was a random attack. We’re still working very hard to find out what took place. 

'Candidly, there has been some challenges for us in terms of the accounts of what’s taken place. So, we’re asking for full cooperation.'

Madera told The Detroit Free Press that between 25 and 30 shell casings were recovered from where the shooting took place.

The teenagers earlier claimed to search for a passenger's brother and claimed to be going to a movie theater, police told the newspaper. 

Stalker attended University Liggett School, was on the honor roll and played lacrosse, The Detroit Free Press reported.

Stalker's classmate Alexander Minanov told the newspaper 'It's just really sad that instead of planning for Christmas, the family has to plan for a funeral.'
