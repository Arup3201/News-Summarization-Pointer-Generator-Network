Hazel Irvine provoked anger on Twitter by referring to Wales as a principality during the Opening Ceremony of the Commonwealth Games

BBC presenter Hazel Irvine provoked fury last night after she referred to Wales as a principality during the Opening Ceremony of the Glasgow 2014 games.

The Scottish broadcaster made the slip up as Team Wales entered the city's Celtic Stadium during the official opening of the Commonwealth Games last night.

Her words caused fury among viewers of the event - who took to Twitter to voice their anger.

One, Meleri Thomas wrote: 'Distressing to be referred to as 'the principality' at the @thecgf opening ceremony.'

Another, Richard Davies, added: 'Bloody hell Wales is not a principality Hazel Irvine!! #BBC #Glasgow2014.'

Natalie McGarry wrote: 'Hello Wales! Wait, did she just call Wales a principality? I misheard, right.'

Daniel Roberts added: 'We're not a principality for the love of God!!!!!'

Gwenllian Griffiths wrote: 'Hard to believe that Wales was just referred to as "the principality" on BBC by Hazel Irvine. Need a correction @huwbbc #Glasgow2014'

Sara Medi Jones added: 'Oh no she didn't ... principality? Show some respect @BBCOne - Wales is a country.'

When approached by MailOnline, a spokeswoman from the BBC said: 'It was a genuine error and no offence was intended.'

The term principality refers to a sovereign 
state whose ruling monarch is a prince or a princess with an executive 
role in the state.

The Prince of Wales has not held such a position in the country for centuries.

The country is governed by the National Assembly for Wales and the Welsh Government - which was established as separate institutions under the Government of Wales Act 2006.

In
 2011, Wales was recognised in the international community as a country 
following a campaign by south Wales politician Leanne Wood.

The
 South Wales Central AM lobbied for Wales to be given country status after an International 
Standards Organisation (ISO) newsletter referred to the country as a principality.

Meleri Thomas said it was 'distressing' for the country to be referred to as 'the principality'

In a letter to the politician, the organisation said: 'The ISO 3166-2 entry originated in a traditional understanding of the status of Wales as given in reference works such as the 1976 Oxford Illustrated Dictionary.

'Earlier this year we were alerted by the Welsh Assembly Government to the fact that the notion of Wales as a principality is now outdated, and that Wales should properly be considered a country.'

The opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games - with its dancing Tunnock's Teacakes and show-stealing Scottie dogs - was watched by more than nine million viewers on BBC1.

The Glasgow spectacle, which featured musical performances by Rod Stewart and Nicola Benedetti, had a peak audience of 9.4 million - exceeding the number who watched the last time the Games were staged in the UK in 2002, when 8.9 million tuned in at the height of the Manchester opening.

An average of 7.6 million watched for the duration of the programme, which lasted more than three hours, down from the 8.2 million who stuck with the whole ceremony 12 years ago.

But the audience was up hugely on the levels for 2010 stage in Delhi, which drew an average of 3 million, and 2006 for Melbourne, which pulled in 1.3 million.

Last night's coverage accounted for more than two-fifths of the viewers watching TV at that time.

In Scotland, the audience peaked at 
1.9 million viewers, accounting for more than three-quarters of those 
watching TV at the time.

BBC
 Scotland said it was one of the biggest average audiences ever recorded
 north of the border and the third best performing programme since 2001 
after the opening and closing ceremonies of the London 2012 Olympic 
Games.
