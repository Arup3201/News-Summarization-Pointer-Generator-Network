National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden is living off public donations, according to his lawyer.

Anatoly Kucherena said Snowden has no money and is waiting for his first paycheck from his Russian website employer.

The lawyer said the analyst's own money has been mostly used up on rent, food and paying for his own security.

Edward Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said his client had no money and is lonely

Mr Kucherena told Rossiiskaya Gazeta that his client is 'absolutely alone in Russia'.

He said: 'He doesn't have his mom, or dad, or relations, or anybody here.'

Snowden is living in Russia after President Putin granted him a one-year temporary refugee status.

Mr Kucherena revealed last month that Snowden had secured a job but denied the post was as a state employee.

He said: 'Edward starts work in November. He will provide support for a large Russian site.'

Last week, an open letter purportedly written by Snowden said the U.S. and British intelligence agencies were the 'worst offenders' for mass surveillance.

The former NSA analyst has spent his money on rent, food and bodyguards and is now relying on handouts

He wrote: 'While the NSA and GCHQ (the British national security agency) appear to be the worst offenders -- at least according to the documents that are currently public -- we cannot forget that mass surveillance is a global problem and needs a global solution.'

Snowden has requested for clemency from the U.S. government for his alleged crimes.

However, the Obama administration made it clear it has no intention of showing leniancy.

Snowden. 30, fled to Russia in June, where he was granted temporary asylum and respite from extradition threats to the US where he faces espionage charges.

He has admitted in interviews he was the source behind the leak of classified NSA documents, which revealed the existence of top-secret surveillance programs that collect records of domestic e-mails and telephone calls in the United States and monitor the cell phone and Internet activity of overseas residents. He is wanted in the United States on espionage charges.
