Her husband Jay Z hinted at a second pregnancy back in September.

And now Beyonce Knowles is stirring the pot once again.

The 33-year-old singer took to Instagram on Sunday to share a snap of herself covered in sand, appearing to have created a bit of a baby bump.

Hinting something? Beyonce Knowles shared this photo on Sunday, seeming to have created a bit of a baby belly while covered in sand

The star's followers even noticed the burgeoning belly, with commentators leaving remarks such as, 'pregnant!!?'

In the captionless beach photo, the Flawless hitmaker is only fully revealing her face, which is covered with oversized round Quay sunglasses. 

Queen Bey appears blissful, smiling as an orange headband is pulling her thick tresses away from her eyes.

Behind the star's noggin is a white towel, surely making her sandy recline more comfortable.

Beyonce, her husband Jay Z, 45, and daughter Blue Ivy, three - also pictured in the beach snap - have recently been on holiday in Southeast Asia.

Just earlier this week, they were spotted sightseeing at Cambodia's historic Buddhist temple Angkor Wat, following some time in Thailand.

There, the entertainer opted to wear a loose-fitted leopard blouse, perhaps overtly covering up her belly.

Back in September, Jay Z was reported to have hinted Beyonce is pregnant with their second child.

The rap mogul allegedly changed some of his lyrics to include the words 'cause she pregnant with another one' during their first of two Paris shows while on the European leg of their On The Run tour, according to Radar Online. 

It was during their rendition of the track Beach Is Better that Jay is said to have adjusted the lyrics to make the surprise announcement to the audience.

Jay Z and Beyonce have been married since 2008 and have previously been vocal about wanting to expand their brood.

Starting speculation: Jay was reported to have tampered with his lyrics during a concert in September, hinting at baby news by saying, 'cause she pregnant with another one'

Expanding? The power couple already have a three-year-old daughter Blue Ivy, who just celebrated her birthday on January 3rd
