They may be married to other people, but that didn't stop Katharine McPhee kissing former Smash director Michael Morris in broad daylight.

The pair are apparently dating after they were pictured locking lips in Los Angeles at the weekend after having lunch together, TMZ reports.

The stars, who first met on the NBC show which was cancelled in May, have both been married to long-term partners for several years.

Something to tell us?: Smash star Katharine McPhee was seen kissing the show's director Michael Morris on Sunday, despite the fact both of them are married to other people

The Brothers & Sisters director 
has been married to actress Mary McCormack for more than a decade, and 
the couple have three young daughters together, aged between two and 
nine.

Meanwhile the 29-year-old singer has been married to 47-year-old Nick Cokas since 2008, and he is also her manager.

The couple 
met three years before when they performed together in a
 stage production of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.

Tender moment: Michael stroked Katharine's face after they enjoyed lunch together. He was still wearing his wedding ring while hers was absent

However
 sources close to the couple told the website that the two have been 
'separated for six months and are currently living apart.'

Michael appears to be split from his wife as well. In early October while Chelsea Handler - who split from Andrea Balazs this summer - was telling her audience that she likes to go out with her guest Mary, the actress interrupted and said of the talk show host, 'Sheâ€™s single now, too, so itâ€™s like, you canâ€™t keep up.'

Michael was still wearing his wedding ring as he and Katharine walked to her car together, while the actress and singer's ring was noticeably absent from her hand.

When they reached the vehicle, it became
 clear that they are more than friends as they kissed passionately, and 
Michael was seen tenderly stroking Katharine's cheek.

Katharine and Michael were also spotted holding hands and cuddling while strolling around Hollywood together, while both wore jeans and aviator sunglasses.

Katharine also sported a holey black knit jumper and an electric blue jacket, while Michael wore a pale blue T-shirt under a black corduroy jacket.

The American Idol runner-up played Karen Cartwright in the musical show between 2012 and this year, in which Michael directed a number of episodes.

Mail Online has contacted a representative for Katharine McPhee for comment.
