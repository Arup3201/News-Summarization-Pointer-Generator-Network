The Navy SEAL’s dog who tragically refused to leave his fallen master’s side during an emotional funeral is going to a good home.

Labrador retriever Hawkeye sat by the coffin of his master Petty Officer Jon Tumilson, 35, who was killed in the major U.S. helicopter crash in Afghanistan this month.

Mr Tumilson was remembered by around 1,500 mourners but it was Hawkeye who really captured the public’s emotions in a photo taken by the fallen SEAL’s cousin, Lisa Pembleton.

Sadness: Navy SEAL Jon Tumilson's Labrador retriever Hawkeye was loyal to the end, as he refused to leave his master's side during an emotional funeral

Man's best friend: Mr Tumilson's family members followed Hawkeye into the service before he lay down

Concerned members of the public who 
have seen the heart-wrenching photo will be pleased to hear that there 
is a happy ending for Hawkeye.

He will be staying with Scott Nichols,
 who had previously looked after him while Mr Tumilson was away on duty 
overseas. Family members had followed Hawkeye into the funeral.

Nikki Virgilio, a friend of Mr 
Tumilson - known as J.T. - was at the funeral last week and said Hawkeye
 was a personal pet rather than a military dog.

'I can happily report to you that 
Hawkeye was willed to one of J.T.'s good friends, the same one that took
 care of him whenever J.T. was deployed overseas,' she wrote on 
Facebook.

‘J.T. was going to be a Navy SEAL come hell or high water,’ Mr Nichols said. ‘J.T. 
was not afraid to die. He was afraid of losing his parents.’

Big funeral: Petty Officer Jon Tumilson, 35, killed in the Afghanistan helicopter crash this month, was remembered by around 1,500 mourners

Pride: Mr Tumilson's mother and father were told they helped raise an 'outstanding man - a hero'

Mr Tumilson, of San Diego, California,
 was one of 38 killed on August 6 when a rocket-propelled grenade took 
out a U.S. Chinook helicopter.

His funeral was held last Friday in his hometown of Rockford, Iowa, at the Rudd-Rockford-Marble Rock Community School.

Ms Pembleton said: ‘I felt compelled 
to take one photo to share with family members that couldn't make it or 
couldn't see what I could from the aisle.

'To say that he was an amazing man 
doesn't do him justice. The loss of Jon to his family, military family 
and friends is immeasurable.'

During the service, U.S. Navy 
Lieutenant Robert Bradshaw told Mr Tumilson's parents that they helped 
raise an ‘outstanding man - a hero’.

Family, friends and servicemen, along

packed the school's gymnasium.

‘If J.T. had known he was going to be 
shot down when going to the aid of others, he would have went anyway,’ 
friend and soldier Boe Nankivel said.

Mr Tumilson's sister, Kristie Pohlman, said he always dreamed of joining the military's elite special forces unit.

‘Your dreams were big and seemed 
impossible to nearly everyone on the outside,’ she said. ‘I always knew 
you'd somehow do what you wanted.’

Mr Tumilson, who joined the Navy in 1995, is survived by two sisters and his parents, George and Kathleen.
