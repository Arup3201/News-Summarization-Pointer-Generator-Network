From Peruvians in flamboyant cerise and gold skirts to Kenya's Samburu people in their crimson cloaks and beaded collars, the world has no shortage of natty dressers.

One woman who knows exactly where to find them is Anne Menke, a Vogue photographer turned traveller who in 2012, scoured the world for stylish citizens.

Now Menke is back with a new and updated version of her book See The World Beautiful which includes the results of a perambulation around Mongolia and a trip to India's holy city, Varanasi.

Beautiful: Varanasi, on the banks of the River Ganges, is one of India's holiest cities but that doesn't mean its residents can't dress - these women look beautiful

And as these incredible photos reveal, there's no shortage of style, whether in the snowy Alaskan wilderness or in the remote Kenyan bush.

'My favourite thing as a fashion and travel photographer is to go a little farther up the mountain, a little farther down that bumpy dirt road, to show the ways people in remote places work and play and live,' writes Menke in the introduction.

'I eagerly trekked neverending miles and timeless hours, from Jujuy Province, Argentina to Ulan Bator, Mongolia to Lijang, China and Quebec Province, Canada.

'Between fashion shoots for Vogue, Condé Nast Traveler and other magazines, I was lucky enough to glimpse the beauty of indigenous cultures – their immensely differing, but each in its own way traditional, iconographies, architectural modes, and styles of dressing.

'Meeting people with such wildly dissimilar references and exploring new socio-cultural terrain is the source and inspiration of my life. To be able to share that with the world is an incredible gift.'

Highlights include a stunning photo of Argentina's 'Angel Horses' with wings created by the cow-hide shield attached to them by ranchers and a striking shot of a Honolulu girl, pretty in a grass skirt and bright garland of flowers.

Other stars include a pair of Kenyan women who combine their demure floral dresses with colourful turbans and the Inuits dressed in glamorous pale fur and leather ensembles.

'Fashion is where you find it, provided 
you are receptive to its ever- presence in everyday life,' adds designer Tommy Hifliger in the foreword.

'I have 
travelled the globe with Anne and feel that she captures the true essence
 of beauty in her imagery, far from mainstream media, from the deserts 
of Boliva to the waters of the Ganges River!'

Proof, were any still required, that fashion truly is a global medium whether you're swathed in fur in Alaska or patrolling the steppes in beads.

See the World Beautiful by Anne Menke, £55, is published by Glitterati Incorporated.
