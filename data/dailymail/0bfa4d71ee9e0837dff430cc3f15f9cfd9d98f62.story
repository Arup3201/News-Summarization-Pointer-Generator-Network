Not satisfied with knocking Liverpool out of the Champions League, Basle have posted a picture online mocking Brendan Rodgers' side.

Fabian Frei opened the scoring for the Swiss champions in the 25th minute, and things got worse for the hosts when Lazar Markovic was sent off for lashing out at Behrang Safari. Steven Gerrard gave his side hope when he scored late on but Basle held on to go through to the last 16.

The final whistle brought a miserable night to an end for Liverpool, but the Swiss weren't quite finished.

They posted a picture on their Instagram account showing a battered and dazed Liverpool player being held up by players from Chelsea and Tottenham, who tell the Red: 'You'll never walk alone.'

The picture makes reference to the fact that Basle have now beaten all three teams in European competitions in the last two years.

Last season Basle beat Chelsea 2-1 at Stamford Bridge and 1-0 at St Jakob Park. The season before  they knocked Tottenham out of the Europa League at the quarter-final stage on penalties after the two sides drew 4-4 on aggregate.

Peperami also poked fun at the Reds following their Champions League exit on Tuesday

However, Basle were not the only ones to poke fun at the Reds.

Peperami posted a picture of Mario Balotelli posing as Super Mario in the video game, along with the caption 'no reset button this season', while Optimist Lad compared Brendan Rodgers to the Titanic.

Troll Football joked there was more chance of getting a dragon for Christmas than securing Champions League football for the Reds again next season.
