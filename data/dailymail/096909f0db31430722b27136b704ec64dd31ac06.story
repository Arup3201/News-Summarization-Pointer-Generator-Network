A high school student who suffers from autism and Down Syndrome was given a varsity letter by his mother to celebrate that he had begun playing special needs basketball at his high school, and then shockingly told he had no right to wear that letter.

Michael Kelley, who attends East High School in Wichita, Kansas, wore the letter, which his mother purchased for him, on a jacket, until he was told to remove it and never wear it again at school.

Now though, many are coming out to show their support for Michael - including the Chicago Bulls.

'Teachers told the parents they would prefer he not wear the letter on his jacket,' East High Principal Ken Thiessen told KSN.

When asked if that policy might change however, given the situation, he said; 'We have considered it, and our decision was no. We decided that is not appropriate in our situation because it is not a varsity level competition.'

Wanting more answers, Mrs. Kelley turned to the district, who said there was no official rule about who could and cold not wear a varsity letter.

As for how this all happened, Mrs. Kelley said; 'Another parent, from what I am told, was upset that my son was wearing his letter jacket.'

Michael however is getting a lot of support in the aftermath on this decision however, and a Change.org petition to change this rule already has over 30,000 signatures.

In addition, many are voicing their support for Michael using the hashtag #GiveThemLetters on Twitter.

Also, Adrian Griffin, the assistant coach of the Bulls, has donated an autographed jersey, basketball, and a Derek Rose bobble head to the Kelley family which he says they can auction off and use to buy uniforms for the special needs basketball team Michael plays on.

'Supporting Michael, East High and all special needs student-athletes who share the passion and drive for the game I love. We are All Blue Aces!' wrote Griffin, who attended East High Sxchool.

What's more, Mark Calvin, the principal and athletic director at Santana High School in Santana, Kansas has sent one of their varsity letter for Michael to wear.

'Before he got the letter he was one of the biggest cheerleaders in the school it was incredible, after he got the letter jacket it just sky rocketed him to another level,' said Calvin of Michael.

He then said of the situation; 'We can’t be cookie cutter. We have all kinds of kids with all kinds of different needs and we need to be able to make our rules adjust to meet those needs.'

He added; 'It’s a message to Michael that you can be a part of something anywhere you want to.' 

As for Mrs. Kelley, she is not just fighting for her adopted son Michael, but all the kids, saying; 'It’s not just my son. It’s every student that was out there last night. It’s every student that’s there on Fridays that plays their hardest and to the best of their capability regardless what that is.'
