An eight-year-old boy was covered in pepper spray, forced to eat his
 own vomit, gagged and locked in a cabinet to silence his cries for help just days before his mother and her boyfriend allegedly beat him to death, according to court records published on Monday reports the Los Angeles Times.

Gabriel Fernandez's mother, Pearl, 30, and her boyfriend, Isauro Aguirre, 34, abused 'every inch' of their child before his gruesome murder in May, 2013, a Los Angeles' court was told by prosecutors.

Prosecutors claim that 'for eight straight months, Gabriel was abused, beaten and tortured more severely than many prisoners of war,' - even writing his own suicide note - and convened the grand jury after repeated delays in setting up a preliminary hearing for Fernandez and Aguirre who are charged with murder

Repeated warning signs were missed by authorities and in the aftermath of Gabriel's death two Los Angeles social workers were fired as were two supervisors according to the Los Angeles Times.

The tragedy came to a head when Fernandez dialed 911 on May 22, 2013, because her son had stopped breathing.

When deputies of Los Angeles County arrived she told them that her son had fallen and hit his head on a dresser, according to testimony given on Monday.

However, the paramedics told the court that Gabriel was found in a bedroom, not breathing having suffered three broken ribs and a cracked skull. X-rays revealed BB pellets in his lungs and groin.

Gabriel was rushed to hospital and died on May 24 testified James Cermak, a Los Angeles County Fire Department paramedic, who described the horrific abuse the boy allegedly suffered.

The abuse lasted eight months said Deputy District Attorney Jonathan Hatami and became more pronounced before his death, according to statements given by his two siblings, who are both minors.

They said that their brother was forced by their mother and her boyfriend to eat cat feces and rotten spinach and was never allowed to go to the bathroom.

His mother and her boyfriend would call him gay and beat him when he played with dolls and made him wear girls' clothes to school.

He was hit with a belt buckle, a metal hanger and a wooden club and one day Fernandez knocked his teeth out with the bat.

This sustained abuse led to several reports to social services by concerned teachers but Gabriel was never removed from his home.

Indeed, deputies investigated the family home and Gabriel's school for signs of abuse and that the boy had claimed to be suicidal.

Every time an incident was reported it was concluded there was no abuse and no one ever wrote up a detailed report.

The grand jurors were told by Timothy O'Quinn, a sheriff's homicide detective, that no deputies took away items of clothing for testing.

After Gabriel's death, investigators found clothes covered in blood, BB pellet holes in them and a wooden club doused in blood.

Social services in Los Angeles have begun a special commission to examine the failings of the department before Gabriel's death, according to the Los Angeles Times.

On the day of May 22, 2013, Gabriel's siblings told the grand jury that Fernandez beat her son because he wouldn't clean up his toys.

Then she took him to a bedroom and was joined by Aguirre and chillingly, the next thing Gabriel's siblings heard was screaming and banging and then silence.

Gabriel's 13-year-old brother said, 'It just went quiet'.

According to the Los Angeles Times, James Kemp Ribe of the LA County coroner's office told the grand jury that he had 'never seen this many skin injuries on on child.'

A teacher, Jennifer Garcia, told the court that she had tried to contact social services after Gabriel arrived at school with black eyes and bruises.

One of the social workers who followed up on this said that all she could determine that Gabriel had was a blister on his lip.

Another counselor at his school phoned 911 after finding a suicide note that Gabriel wrote, which social workers again dismissed because they determined he had no specific plan to carry out the plan to end his life.

Worse still, when authorities came to interview Gabriel's siblings, they revealed to the grand jury they lied because they were terrified their mother and her boyfriend would beat them too.

The agency's director Philip Browning acknowledged the system failed Gabriel. The case illustrates a need for more critical thinking and common sense in evaluating cases, he said.

County social workers became aware of Pearl Fernandez a decade ago when her oldest son had a head injury during a car accident. It was determined he wasn't wearing a seat belt.

The Times said a relative later reported she allegedly beat the same son and wanted to disown him. However, social workers said the complaint was unfounded.
