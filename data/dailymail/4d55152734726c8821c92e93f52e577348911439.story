Ukip is to delay publishing its manifesto for as long as possible, party leader Nigel Farage revealed today.

The party’s detailed pitch to voters had been expected to be set out at its spring conference in Margate this weekend.

But Mr Farage today insisted he wants to release it as ‘late as practicably possible’ in the election campaign, which would give voters less time to challenge the party on its contents.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage today insisted he wants to release his manifesto as ‘late as practicably possible’ in the election campaign

Mr Farage has previously been forced to disown the party’s entire 2010 manifesto as ‘drivel’ which he claimed he did not read, despite writing its foreword.

It included pledges to improve Britain by painting trains in traditional colours, deploying soldiers on the street and enforcing a dress code for taxi drivers and theatregoers.

Since then, the party has enjoyed a surge in support, topping the polls in the European Parliament elections and securing two elected MPs who defected from the Tories.

As a result, Ukip has faced closer scrutiny of its policies, with splits emerging over key areas of tax, spending and social policy.

Now it has emerged Mr Farage plans to keep the party’s policy pitch to voters secret for as long as he can.

He told BBC One’s Sunday Politics: ‘My view on our release of the manifesto is we should do it as late as practicably possible because I think by then people will want to see something fresh, new and positive.’

Bizarrely, he said he did not want to release his manifesto yet because the ‘general election campaign has already gone on for far too long as far as most of the public are concerned’.

He added: ‘People are getting bored to death. Every day there are all sorts of pronouncements being made by Labour and the Conservatives to appease all sorts of special interest groups. I think most of what’s being said is already going in one ear and out of the other.’

Tim Aker was been replaced as the Ukip policy chief after failing to complete the party's manifesto in time. Ukip's deputy chairman Suzanne Evans was put in charge of the manifesto process, with the final document to be unveiled in Margate this weekend

Nigel Farage has disowned the whole of the 2010 Ukip manifesto, despite writing its foreword.

Some of the more eye-catching policies in Ukip's 2010 manifesto include:

Parliament is due to be dissolved on March 30, with the general election held on May 7.

In January it emerged that Tim Aker had been replaced as the Ukip policy chief after failing to complete the party's manifesto in time.

Ukip's deputy chairman Suzanne Evans was put in charge of the manifesto process, with the final document to be unveiled in Margate this weekend. 

Asked why it was not published, Mr Farage said today: ‘No, no. That was never, ever said. The idea we would publish a manifesto so long before a general election.’ 

But Miss Evans made clear in January: ‘'I relish the task of putting together the final details and presenting a sensible, radical and fully costed manifesto at our spring conference in Margate.' 

Mr Farage has previously insisted all of the party’s manifesto will have been full costed, but suggested voting Ukip is about ‘a state of mind’ rather than detailed policies. However, policy splits have emerged. 

Mr Farage sparked controversy by claiming that privatising large parts of the NHS was 'a debate that we're all going to have to return to' if the health service was going to stay affordable. 

But Ukip's health spokesman, Louise Bours, insisted her leader was out of touch with the public when it came to the NHS. She insisted the party’s policy on the NHS would contain ‘not a whiff’ of privatisation. 

Mr Farage also clashed with his economics spokesman Patrick O’Flynn, after he suggested a 'Wag Tax' on designer shoes and handbags. 

The UKIP leader tore up the plan for 25 per cent VAT rate for top-end goods insisting: 'It's dead.'
