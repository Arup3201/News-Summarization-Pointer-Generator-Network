Murdered: Three police officers have been suspended following the murder of Bijan Ebrahimi, 44, who was burned to death by neighbours who wrongly believed he was a paedophile

Three police officers have been suspended after they arrested an innocent man just days before he was beaten and set alight by murderous vigilantes who wrongly believed he was a paedophile.

Bijan Ebrahimi had 
taken photographs of youths vandalising his hanging baskets and intended
to hand them to police as evidence, but instead was held for taking pictures of children.

Officers took Mr Ebrahimi, originally from Iran, away for questioning, as other 
residents on his estate gathered in the street and chanted, ‘Paedo, 
paedo’.

Two days after his release Mr
Ebrahim's charred body was found burning 
in the road. Lee James, 24, has admitted murder and Stephen Norley, 24, admitted assisting him.

Today it emerged that three of the police involved in the victim's arrest are now not at work and have been accused by the victim's family of 'failing' him.

An Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation is currently investigating the police contact he had prior to his death in July 2013.

Six
police officers involved in the case have all been served notices of 
gross misconduct, including an inspector, sergeant and PC involved in 
his detention.

Avon
and Somerset Chief Constable Nick Gargan has already admitted that 
police and other agencies involved had failed Mr Ebrahimi.

His family has pleaded with the IPCC to finish the investigation into his death as they cannot wait 'a day longer' for the findings into his murder.

They say until the inquiry has come to an end there will be no 'lessons learned by the authorities'.

A statement, released by the family solicitor, begged the IPCC to conclude its investigation into the case.

They said: 'It is difficult to put into words the family's grief at a blameless man being beaten to death and set on fire in 21st Century England.

Wrongly accused: Mr Ebrahimi was attacked outside this building in Bristol after a neighbour who spotted him taking photographs of yobs wrecking his garden wrongly accused him of being a paedophile

Vigilante: Even though Mr Ebrahimi was cleared by police of any wrongdoing, local resident Lee James decided to take the law into his own hands and launched a brutal attack on the 44-year-old

'Their concern is to ensure that lessons are learned by the authorities so that no other family has to endure this horror.

'Information regarding Bijan's final days and hours is still awaited from the IPCC.

'It would ease the family's pain if they did not have to wait a day longer for this information.'
