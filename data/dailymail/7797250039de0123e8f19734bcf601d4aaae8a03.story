Callous: Stephen Whittaker, 37, befriended the family of a dying baby, just to steal from their charity appeal

A conman motivated by 'nothing more than greed,' callously befriended the family of a dying baby, just to steal from their charity appeal.

Stephen Whittaker, 37, even went to the extraordinary lengths of taking part in a sponsored bike ride, but never handed over a penny of the estimated £800 he raised.

Not content with ripping off one family, the Wythenshawe dad-of-two was also conning two other major charities.

They believe he could have been raking in £400 a day tricking kind-hearted shoppers by waving buckets outside supermarkets saying he was collecting for The Christie hospital and Barnado’s - often with his young son in tow.

It has emerged he could have been staging the con for at least three years.

It will never be known exactly how much Whittaker stole - but police believe it runs into thousands of pounds.

Whittaker, of Felton Avenue, Benchill, pleaded guilty at Manchester magistrates’ court to three charges of theft.

The family of Tyler Furness - who was born three months premature at Stepping Hill Hospital - were there to watch him brought to justice.

As he walked out of court, Tyler’s furious grandfather thrust a photograph of his grandson into Whittaker’s hands, shouting: 'This is who you stole from.'

A shame-faced Whittaker stared at the floor as he was bailed for sentencing.

Tyler, from Buxton, died from chronic lung disease at 13 months, shortly after Whittaker was arrested.

Whittaker first hit upon the callous plot after seeing a charity poster in Wythenshawe hospital.

He said he wanted to help raise money for its neonatal unit which cared for Tyler via their charity the Light At The End fund.

But after meeting the family and taking part in their sponsored bike ride he pocketed an estimated £800 in donations.

The fundraising manager at Wythenshawe Hospital called police after it became clear Whittaker hadn’t handed over any of the money.

He initially lied and said he had handed in a smaller amount of money to a security guard prompting a full investigation by the fundraising office.

But when questioned by police he eventually confessed to stealing the sponsorship cash.

As police began investigating, it emerged he had stolen thousands from other charities including Barnado’s, where he had been working as a volunteer, and The Christie.

He asked for official charity buckets and was seen outside ASDA and Tesco supermarkets in Wythenshawe collecting money.

Whittaker also told the charities he was doing other sponsored bike rides to raise money. But the only money ever banked by Whittaker to any charity was £358 which he gave to The Christie after he was repeatedly questioned.

Tyler's grandmother said Whittaker's deceit added further pain to their already overwhelming grief.

Tracey Furness told how she feels ‘violated and repulsed’ after being taken in by the serial conman.

She founded the Light At The End fund for neo-natal units with her son Nathan, 22, and daughter-in-law Kelly Gilbride, 21, shortly after Tyler's birth.

When Whittaker asked to take part in the sponsored ride Tracey said she was dubious about allowing a stranger to join the ride and insisted he came to meet the family at their home in Buxton.

Jobless Whittaker, who is believed to claim around £1,800 a month in benefits, told them he had done lots of charity work previously because ‘he wanted to give back to society’.

Tyler's grandfather John Furness, 54, even told how he and others bought Whittaker drinks during the 150-mile coast to coast trip because he was on the dole.

He joined the Furness family and eight friends on the ride at the end of September last year.

Tracey Furness said: 'All the family were devastated by the revelation that Whittaker had targeted us, impudently participated in cycling 150 miles, exploited members of the public and then self-indulged with innocent victims’ money.

'I personally feel violated and repulsed to have welcomed him to our home and to aid our cause.'

The police officer who investigated Whittaker’s charity thefts said the conman was ‘motivated by nothing more than greed’.

Pc Phil Gurton, from the Northenden neighbourhood team, led the probe into Whittaker’s scam.

After Whittaker denied the allegations a crucial piece of evidence was handed over by Whittaker’s former partner.

While being questioned at his home she overheard Whittaker claiming he had no record of his donations and gave Pc Gurton a sponsorship form full of pledges.

The officer went on to interview hundreds of kind-hearted people on the lists.

Pc Gurton said: 'The actions of Whittaker are that of an individual who was motivated by nothing more than greed.

'Whittaker took advantage of the public’s generosity and we have no doubt that in all cases he collected a lot of money and kept it.'

He also stressed the public should not let Whittaker’s actions put them off giving to charity.

The three charities ripped off by Whittaker last night hit out at his disloyal, sickening and callous actions.

During his scam Whittaker took money meant for Barnado’s, The Christie and a Wythenshawe Hospital appeal.

Samantha Howarth, a community fundraiser with Barnado’s, said he had been volunteering at a Barnado’s shop in Wythenshawe town centre when he asked if he could have some collection buckets to start raising more money in the streets.

He also said he was planning to do a sponsored bike ride from Edinburgh to Manchester. It’s not known whether he ever completed the ride but Samantha says he told her he was aiming to raise up to £5,000.

She believes he may have pocketed at least half that amount.

Samantha said: 'He was very active - he was always out and about collecting. It is so sad. I was really disappointed when I found out.'

Jan Owen, fundraising coordinator at Wythenshawe Hospital, said she is upset that Whittaker’s theft has ‘soured’ the fundraising efforts for baby Tyler Furness.

And a spokeswoman for The Christie said: 'It is even more of a shame considering we are fortunate enough to have thousands of very loyal hard working fundraisers.'

Whittaker will return to Manchester crown court for sentencing on June 14.
