Forget the blockbuster film Gone In Sixty Seconds - the nimble car thief takes just 10 seconds to nab your motor, more than six times faster than a decade ago.

Angelina Jolie and Nicholas Cage's characters in the 2000 film would've been left trailing in the wake of today's fleet of foot thieves, according to a new report released yesterday.

And Black Audis are top of car thieves’ shopping lists with 150,000 cars are stolen each year and two thirds of these taken with their keys.

The study by criminologists for LV= car insurance reveals that forced ignition thefts have fallen massively over the past decade, with criminals now preferring to steal the keys and then drive away.

This has drastically reduced the time it takes the average car thief to make a slick getaway by more than six times.

The report, which includes interviews with car crime victims and convicted car thieves, shows that car thefts where the perpetrator steals the keys now account for nearly two thirds of all cars stolen.

In just under half of the thefts the car keys are stolen from the owner’s home during a burglary, although six per cent of victims had their keys taken forcibly from them before the thief drove away in their car.

Black or silver BMWs like the one pictured are also among the most sought after cars by thieves

Official figures show that 88,103 cars were stolen in 2011/12 but these do not account for car theft as a result of burglary, which goes undocumented.

As a result, it is estimated that up to 4o per cent of car thefts go unreported as they are classified as burglary (because the keys were taken from the house), which would equate to an additional 58,735 motor thefts this year - bringing the total to 146,838.

Modern car security functions have resulted in car thieves adopting more inventive means of stealing vehicles - some of which appear to be straight out of a movie script.

Cases of ‘lifting’ - where the vehicle is lifted onto the back of a truck - have increased steadily since 2009, and accounted for around 12 per cent of car thefts in 2011 and 14 per cent of thefts so far in 2012.

One criminal confessed: 'I’ve lifted cars in broad daylight. Flat bed truck and a luminous vest and people think you’re a clamper. They’re lifting more for tax and insurance now, so as long as you look the part no-one cares.'

Many cars are now stolen to order, with criminals purposely targeting high-end makes and models, in popular colours.

According to thieves the most sought after cars are black Audis, silver and black BMWs with the least popular being yellow Smart cars. Thieves also keep their eyes peeled for features such as air conditioning, alloy wheels, CD players, metallic paint and integrated sat navs.

The highest number of recorded car thefts by police force 2011/12:

The report adds that the majority of stolen cars are never recovered. A small number are sold directly to a UK buyer the thief knows or via an online auction site but most seem to disappear altogether.

Many cars end up being stripped down into spare parts, 'a car is worth ten times more in bits than it is as a whole,' according to one criminal.

Some cars are shipped overseas, mainly to Africa, in lead-lined containers that prevent tracker signals from working.

John O’Roarke, Managing Director of LV= car insurance said: 'Improvements in car security mean that criminals now place a greater emphasis on stealing the keys rather than forcing the ignition.

'There are some basic things that motorists can do to try and prevent theft, such as parking in well lit areas, fitting the car with security devices, and keeping car keys out of sight and out of reach.'
