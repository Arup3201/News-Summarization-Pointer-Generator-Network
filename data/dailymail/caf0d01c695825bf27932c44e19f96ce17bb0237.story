Two 'Stop The Violence' activists have been charged with severely beating a former roommate and fellow campaigner after he let himself into their flat to collect his belongings.

Nikole Ardeno and Emanuel Velez, both 30, were wearing anti-abuse t-shirts when they allegedly attacked Joshua Magraff as he was walking down the street in Washington, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday about 4.30 pm.

Accusing him of burglary, the defendants  kicked the victim as he was unconscious, causing him to have seizures and vomit blood, according to Washington police Chief Chris Luppino.

Ardeno was still wearing the same 'Stop the Violence' shirt that she had worn the night before as she led a march in the city protesting two recent shootings, the chief said.

Police believe Ardeno and Velez attacked Magraff because he had gone to an apartment all three shared to collect his belongings after moving out. 

Ardeno and Velez had come to the police station about 20 minutes before the alleged attack to claim that Magraff was burglarizing the apartment, but police said Magraff appeared to only be taking items that belonged to him as he moved out, Luppino said.

Magraff was still unconscious and in critical condition Wednesday at UPMC Mercy hospital in Pittsburgh, Luppino said. 

A hospital spokeswoman could not update Magraff's condition Thursday because officials there don't release information about alleged crime victims. 

Ardeno, Velez, and Magraff, are all members of the Pennsylvania-based group.

Controversy: Leaders of the campaign group insist they do not tolerate violence and will investigate the claims

Ardeno 'is a big part of that group,' the chief said, and Velez 'is very active with them.'

The group's leader, Suzanne Kelley, said she hoped to speak with Ardeno about her version of the incident, but said the group does not condone violence.

'We do not promote violence at all, and I can't believe this is going on. I don't want the community to get a negative effect from this because they back us,' Kelley said of the defendants. 

Online court records don't list an attorney for the defendants who face a preliminary hearing Nov. 10 on charges of aggravated assault, conspiracy, simple assault and disorderly conduct.

Ardeno remained in the Washington County Jail on Thursday, but Velez had posted bail. He does not have a listed phone number.
