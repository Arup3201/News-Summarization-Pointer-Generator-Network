If you thought watching the luge races at Sochi was exciting, then this video will really get your pulse racing.

Matt Mortensen, who represents the U.S. in men's double luge, has created a video that takes the viewer on a ride down the infamous Russian luge track.

The incredible footage, shot with a GoPro camera, shows Mortensen flying past spectators and camera men at speeds of over 80 mph.

Scroll down for video... 

Mortensen is plunging down the twisting ice track in what is effectively a souped-up tea tray that sits atop a pair of razor-sharp steel blades.

The 28-year-old from Huntington came 14th in the Doubles luge run on Wednesday but this video was taken in 2012 as he was preparing for the race.

Luge is considered to be one of the fastest, scariest and most dangerous sports in the world, even beating the skeleton in terms of speed

For instance, Matthew Antoine of the U.S won bronze in men’s skeleton with a maximum speed of 80.3 mph (129.2 km/hr).

The first international luge race took place in Febuary 1883 with 21 competitors representing six nations.

The 2.5 mile (4km) race, from the Swiss resorts of St. Wolfgang to Klosters, was won by Georg Robertson, a student from Australia, and Peter Minch, a mailman from Klosters,

They each raced to identical first place times of 9 minutes, 15 seconds

Meanwhile, the U.S. best luger, Christopher Mazdzer, had a top speed of 85.3 mph 137.3 km/hr.

This speed, however, was only fast enough to give Madzer 13th place.  

While heading down a run headfirst on a skeleton may seem terrifying, this video proves that laying on your back and leading with your feet is just as bad.

Last week, the Canadian luge coach accused Russia of cheating in the event by heating up the track.

Wolfgang Staudinger said his team were cheated out of a medal by one tenth of a second because the temperature controls were tampered with, slowing his team down.

Canada came fourth overall, behind Germany who took the gold, Russia who claimed silver, and Latvia who won bronze.
