Sacked: Mrs Haydr was unfairly dismissed by Tameside General Hospital, Greater Manchester, in 2013, following accusations from colleagues

A nurse who raised concerns over the standard of patient care at a  hospital was forced out of work after colleagues launched a smear campaign against her, a tribunal has found.

Jean Haydr, 48, was set to be promoted to senior nurse at Tameside General Hospital, Greater Manchester when she was sacked in 2013 following false allegations by other nurses.

'Jealous' colleagues wrongly accused Mrs Haydr, who was described as a 'committed and competent' nurse, of turning up to work smelling of alcohol and of 'violating patients' dignity'.

Mrs Haydr, from Dorylsden, Greater Manchester, claimed that she was dismissed for raising concerns over the standard of patient care at the hospital, where she had worked for 12 years.

Now an employment tribunal has found that the mother-of-three had a 'difficult relationship' with her colleagues, who had 'professional jealousies' about her promotion. 

One colleague who claimed that Mrs Haydr had mocked a patient by putting a sticky note on their back that had 'loser' written on it later admitted that she never saw the word on the note.

While an allegation that Mrs Haydr had taunted a patient by drawing fish and chips on a plate instead of giving him food was dismissed as 'light-hearted banter' with a patient with whom she enjoyed a 'good relationship'.

The tribunal also found that accusations that Mrs Haydr arrived late for work while smelling of alcohol and that she made threats of physical violence were unfounded. 

However, it did find that Mrs Haydr breached social media policy by 'discussing trust business' on Facebook - but ruled that she should not have been dismissed without notice or payment in lieu. 

The hearing concluded that Mrs Haydr was unfairly dismissed because of accusations from colleagues who 'did not like' her.  

Mrs Haydr said that she was relieved her ordeal was over. 

'Committed': Mrs Haydr had worked at Tameside General Hospital for 12 years and was set to be promoted to senior nurse when she was sacked. The tribunal found that other nurses had 'professional jealousies'

But she said the ongoing tribunal had left her out of work, 'blacklisted' by the NHS and struggling to look after her three children. It is understood she wants to return to nursing.

A spokesman for Tameside Hospital said the trust was 'disappointed' with the outcome. 

He said: 'We feel that we acted appropriately at the time of the incidents in 2013 and Mrs Haydr was dismissed in line with the trust's disciplinary policy. 

'Since Mrs Haydr's dismissal in 2013 we have already reviewed our disciplinary policy and procedure and will take further learning from this case.'
