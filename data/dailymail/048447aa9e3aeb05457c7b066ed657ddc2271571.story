A gang of bullying car clampers extorted up to £350,000 from motorists while laughing off their desperate protests.

In a judgment that will be cheered by thousands of victims of clamping cowboys, Carlton Williams, 47, Lee Stagg, 43, and Michael Riddle, 30, were jailed for a total of ten years.

Two of the men had also been claiming tens of thousands in illegal benefit payments.

The gang would pounce on unsuspecting 
drivers – often women with young children – and charge them as much as 
£600 to get their cars back.

Police estimate the trio could have 
pocketed £350,000 from their three-year clamping scam before they were 
eventually arrested on blackmail and fraud charges.

The court was told that they used a ‘spotter’ who would lurk near 
private land they managed on behalf of shops and businesses, waiting to 
catch motorists parking.

As soon as they left their car, it would be clamped and a tow truck would be sent within minutes to haul it away.

Notices stated that the price of releasing a clamp was £100, but if  the
vehicle was towed away this increased to £350, rising again to £500 
once ‘storage fees’ were applied.

When the driver returned, the clampers would then aggressively confront 
them, often giving them little chance to pay the minimum release fee. 
Sometimes the gang lifted cars on to tow trucks with drivers still at 
the wheel. Police were inundated with complaints that the clampers were 
demanding up to £600 to get their cars back.

Taunton Crown Court heard the trio operated as A1 Clamping Services from
2005 to 2008 at a base in Bridgwater in Somerset. Don Tait, 
prosecuting, told the court: ‘The sums involved were eye-watering.’

Police say Williams (left) was the ringleader of the gang. Along with Stagg (centre) and riddle (right) he ran the 'bullying' enterprise for three years

Williams and Stagg were also found to have illegally claimed £54,000 in 
council tax benefit, housing benefit and income support. They were also 
not paying income tax or national insurance.

Jailing the three men, Judge Graham Hume Jones said: ‘In the course of 
this business you extorted considerable sums of money from members of 
the public by arrogant, bullying and aggressive behaviour.

The gang would often clamp cars as soon as drivers had parked them

‘You were licensed to clamp cars and had a form of uniform and badges to show your authenticity.

‘In my judgment this aggravates the position because it gave the 
impression the sums you were demanding and the behaviour you were 
exhibiting was authentic. You caused great distress and anxiety to the 
car owners.’ One of their victims, Sally Mendonca, an Army major from 
York, said she had been visiting a relative in Devon when her car was 
clamped and towed.

She said: ‘I explained I was just back from Iraq for a short time and 
all my military kit was in that car and how urgently I needed it. He 
laughed and said, “I get told these stories all the time”. ’ A female 
victim told how she was inside her car when they lifted it up to tow it 
off.

Another, Chloe Brant, who successfully got the clamping gang to release 
her car after calling the police, was warned: ‘I will get you next 
time.’

Williams, from Bridgwater, was jailed for five-and-a-half years after 
pleading guilty to blackmail and making unwarranted demands for money 
with menaces. He also admitted benefit fraud totalling £42,518 and 
engaging in an aggressive commercial practice.

Stagg, also from Bridgwater, admitted blackmail, making unwarranted 
demands with menaces and benefit fraud totalling £12,000, and was jailed
for three years. Riddle, from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, was handed 
an 18-month term for his part in the clamping scam after pleading guilty
to conspiracy to blackmail and making unwarranted demands for money.

After sentencing, police said the operation to snare Williams, Stagg and
Riddle had taken four years. Sergeant Paul Endicott, from Avon and 
Somerset Constabulary, said: ‘They were able to charge what they wanted 
as there was no defined law to control their activities.’
