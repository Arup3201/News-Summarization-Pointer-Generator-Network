A veterinary nurse from Surrey has been hailed a hero after she used a broom to fight off a pair of lions attacking a teenage girl in South Africa.

Natalie Bennett, 24, was cleaning cages at a wildlife centre when the lions grabbed a fellow volunteer and dragged her into their pen.

A male lion and a lioness caught an 18 year old girl by her legs and quick-thinking Natalie came to her rescue and fended off the predators.

Lauren Fagen, from Canada, suffered severe wounds to her legs and thighs.

She'd been dragged into the cage by her legs and was bleeding heavily.

Natalie, who works at the Stone Lion veterinary practice in Wimbledon, was on a three-month volunteer placement at the Moholoholo Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre, near the Drakensberg mountains in South Africa when she heard piercing screams.

She said: ‘At first we thought it was a group messing about because of the lions.

‘A split second later we realised what it was and started running.

‘When we got there a couple of volunteers were in complete shock and were just stood there terrified.’

Miss Fagen, 18, from Montreal, had been dragged through the cage by her knees after kneeling by the cage and putting her hand out for the lions to ‘lick’.

A male grabbed her knee through the bars and pulled her leg into the cage, closely followed by a lioness who grabbed her other leg leaving her powerless.

Natalie, from Carshalton, Surrey, said: ‘We tried to distract the lions by thundering on the cages to try and scare them and we got brooms and brushes to try and get them off her.’

‘It was the lioness we were worried about because they are the killers.

‘The male was hand reared by the student coordinator so all he had to say was no and he would back off, but because there was blood you can't really expect them to differentiate between meat you are providing to them and not.’

After two frantic minutes the lions released their grip on the 18-year-old who was bleeding heavily having sustained severe wounds to her legs and thighs.

As the first medically qualified volunteer on the scene, Natalie sprung into action using skills she learned in the veterinary practice applying pressure to the wound and preventing the girl from going into shock before a paramedic arrived on the scene.

Natalie said: ‘Both her knees were injured and she had puncture wounds in the calf and huge gouges out of her thigh.

‘She was extremely luck the lions didn't just rip her legs off, and that they did not hit the ephemeral artery.’

Her mother, Debbie Bennett, praised her daughter's quick actions.

She said: ‘Natalie is a qualified veterinary nurse so is quite capable of doing first aid and keeping calm so she would have been a very good person to have in that situation.

‘It would have been very difficult for her to see because she loves the wildlife and animals and to see one attack a volunteer must have been very difficult for her.

‘From what she's told me it seems as if she was a bit of a heroine to get in there and try and get this lion off that was attacking a volunteer - I think she did brilliantly.’

Miss Fagen is recovering in hospital but will be left with significant scarring.
