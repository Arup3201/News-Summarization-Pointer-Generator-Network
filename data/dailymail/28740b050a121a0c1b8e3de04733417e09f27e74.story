A young Massachusetts couple were killed in a car crash Wednesday morning on their way pick up relatives who were making a surprise visit.

William Barnett, 20, and Alyssa Grenier, 18, were on their way to Logan International Airport to pick up Grenier's aunt and uncle when, as authorities would later piece together from accident reconstruction and witness accounts, Barnett hit a patch of ice, lost control of the van, and struck a guardrail. 

The van was then struck by a tractor trailer as it swerved back into traffic.

William Barnett and Alyssa Grenier were killed in a car accident as the couple drove to Logan International Airport to pick up Grenier's aunt and uncle, who were flying in for Grenier's birthday

Grenier would have been 19 on Thursday. 

Grenier's aunt and uncle were coming to wish her a happy birthday.

'They were flying out to surprise her, but Billy 
couldn't keep a secret and he ended up telling her. She was so excited 
they were coming,' Barnett's mother, Marlene Barnett, told the Courant.

When the couple failed to arrive at the airport and didn't answer their phones, Marlene drove to Boston on the chance they were broken down on the side of the road.

As Marlene searched, Barnett's sister looked for news about crashes and called the Massachusetts State Police asking about an accident in Framingham she'd read about.

Barnett started work with Tradesmen of New England in Bloomfield in 2013

Troopers then requested Barnett go to the nearest barracks.

William Barnett grew up in Stafford, graduating from high school there in 2012. He went on to Lincoln Technical School in East Windsor to study heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning.

After graduating second in his class, he was hired by the Tradesmen of New England in Bloomfield in 2013. 

'He
 really wanted to get into a trade where he could work with his hands, 
and he loved it,' Marlene said. 'He just loved working with them. They did 
boilers and ducts. He would come home filthy and tired but he loved 
every second of it. He liked the guys he worked with.'

Grenier was turning 19 the day after the accident that took her life

The couple met through a mutual friend in November.

Grenier was born in Connecticut but in recent years lived in California. She returned and was living with the Barnetts at the time of her death.

'She was a very 
sweet girl. She was just so happy with Billy,' Barnett said. 'I've never
 seen him so happy he was just in such a great mood all the time. He 
just lit up when he talked about her.'
