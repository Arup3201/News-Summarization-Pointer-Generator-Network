A baby's parents were told she had ‘nicked’ her finger at nursery – only for her father to discover when he arrived that it had been chopped in half.

Staff at the private £900-a-month crèche allegedly failed to realise Sophie Dedek had lost her fingertip until someone spotted it on the floor while they were cleaning.

Her father Pavel, 37, turned up to find nine-month-old Sophie with a blood-soaked towel wrapped around her hand and the severed 1cm of her finger in a cup of ice.

Pain: Nine-month-old Sophie Dedek lost part of her finger at a nursery in Gosforth, Newcastle. Her parents Jana and Pavel are devastated and demanding compensation for their daughter

Scene: The manager at Kids 1st Day Nursery called 999, but was advised an ambulance would not be necessary by the operator

Hospital: Mr Dedek drove Sophie to A&E where surgeons spent two-and-a-half hours trying to reattach the fingertip

Horrified that no ambulance was on its way, he drove her to A&E himself while a nursery nurse held her arm in the air to stop the bleeding. Surgeons spent two-and-a-half hours trying to reattach the fingertip, which had been cut at the second joint, but the task was fruitless.

Now Mr Dedek, a manager at an estate agent, and his wife Jana, 31, are demanding compensation for Sophie as she will be maimed for life. He said: ‘When I spoke to them on the phone, they said she had just nicked her finger. I thought I would just be picking her up and putting a plaster on it. I arrived to find Sophie’s hand wrapped in a towel, and next to her a cup with the remains of her finger in it.

‘As I drove her to the hospital I started crying. It was the worst day of my life.’

The incident on January 4 came as the Government raised concerns over the number of ‘under-qualified’ people working in childcare. There is no suggestion that the nurse involved in the accident was inadequately qualified.

Sophie was having her second ‘taster’ session at Kids 1st Day Nursery in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne. It is thought the unnamed nurse did not notice the baby had crawled up behind her when she opened a door to put something in a bin.

When she closed the door, she looked down and saw Sophie crying, with blood on the little finger of her right hand. Not realising the full extent of the injury, a fellow nurse wrapped it in a towel while another called her father to ask him to pick her up.

Policies: Newcastle City Council said it found the nursery’s policies and procedures satisfactory following the incident, which has left Sophie maimed for life

Future problems: Sophie has spent weeks in pain and will find some tasks, such as playing musical instruments, harder than her peers when she is older

The nursery manager called 999, but 
the operator advised an ambulance was not necessary for such a small 
ailment. Four minutes later, when staff were cleaning the floor, they 
found the fingertip.

Sophie
has spent weeks in pain and will in future find some tasks, such as 
playing musical instruments, harder than her peers. Her parents want to 
sue the nursery so that she has money to pay for plastic surgery on her 
finger when she turns 18.

A
nursery spokesman said staff acted swiftly after a child trapped a 
finger under a door, adding: ‘The correct first aid was implemented, all
health and safety procedures were followed and the relevant authorities
were informed.’

Ofsted,
which has rated Kids 1st ‘outstanding’, is investigating. Newcastle 
City Council said it found the nursery’s policies and procedures 
satisfactory.

Last 
week, education minister Elizabeth Truss proposed introducing a 
requirement for GCSEs for childcare workers. Critics said plans to 
increase the number of babies a nursery worker can look after could 
threaten child safety.
