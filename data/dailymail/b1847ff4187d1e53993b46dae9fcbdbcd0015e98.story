Broad-shouldered and proud, he beams out from a crowd of more somber faces, a smile on his face and a number 55 emblazoned on his chest - and a powerful head of hair.

Marion Knight, known as Suge even then, is just 17 in this typical high school photo dated 1982, showing a junior year football star posing alongside the Varsity team at Lynwood High School in Los Angeles.

While his compatriots wear glum expressions, he smiles from behind a thick head of hair, showing no hint of the power, money and violence that was to become the hallmark of his later life.

32 years later, Knight, now bald-headed, stands accused of murdering a man in a hit-and-run in his pickup truck, which was caught on video tape.

Proud: Knight smiles in the football photo, while many teammates did not. He allegedly went on to a life of intimidation and violence

He claims it is self-defense. But as he took to the stand, prosecutors reeled off a history of alleged violence and intimidating spanning decades, through which he is accused of reeling in hundreds of thousands of dollars.

It convinced the judge to set the rap mogul's bail at a staggering $25million - the announcement of which led Knight to collapse in the middle of the court-room.

Knight stands accused of intentionally running down two men with a pickup truck at a Los Angeles area burger stand January 29 following an argument on the set of a commercial for the film Straight Outta Compton.

Terry Carter, 55, was killed after being struck by a Ford F-150, while Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 51, survived his injuries.

The 49-year-old co-founder of Death Row Records has pleaded not guilty to murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run charges.

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen set bail for Knight at a whopping $25million after Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Barnes noted that Knight was on bail in a robbery case at the time of the hit-and-run crash.

Knight's attorney argued that his bail should be set at $2million, telling the judge that had his name not been Suge Knight, prosecutors 'wouldn't have filed the case.' 

Medical emergency: Knight collapsed in court Friday shortly after a judge set his bail at $25million after a lengthy list of allegations against him was filed by prosecutors

In seeking the multi-million-dollar bail, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office filed an extensive motion of 295 pages of legal papers and supporting material portraying Knight as a career criminal and repeated violator of probation and parole dating back to 1987. 

The documents also alleged that Knight is part of an ‘ongoing extortion scheme’ in which new rappers arriving in Los Angeles and Las Vegas are ‘required to pay a “tax"’ to Knight.

Knight has pleaded innocent and his lawyers have denied that he intentionally tried to kill Carter and Sloan. Matthew Fletcher also says Knight is blind in his left eye and may not have seen clearly during the incident.

Knight has previous convictions for assault with a deadly weapon and could face 25 years to life in prison under California's so-called three-strikes law if he is convicted at trial.
