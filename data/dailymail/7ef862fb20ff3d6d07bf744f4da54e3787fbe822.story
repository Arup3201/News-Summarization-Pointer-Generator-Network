Campaigners are calling for a rationing ban to be lifted on a drug that gives an extra nine months of life to women with ovarian cancer.

The drug, Avastin, slows the advance of the disease, meaning that sufferers can experience extra months of quality life with their families, according to new trial data.

Doctors claim it is the first major advance for almost 20 years in tackling the disease, known as the ‘silent killer’ because women are often diagnosed too late for a cure.

Avastin, slows the advance of the disease, meaning that sufferers can experience extra months of quality life with their families, according to new trial data

Ovarian cancer affects almost 7,000 women a year and kills more than 4,000 women - the disease claims the lives of over 85 per cent of patients if found at a late stage when it has spread to other parts of the body.

Around 2,000 women a year could benefit from Avastin, but earlier this year it was rejected for routine NHS use for ovarian cancer by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on cost grounds.

The drug which costs around £25,000 for an average patient, has been made available in England through the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF), although funding is due to run out in two years’ time.

The fund does not serve women in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The new data found when women at highest risk of their cancer recurring received Avastin in combination with chemotherapy, and then continued maintenance Avastin, they lived on average 9.4 months longer.

The survival average was 39.7 months compared with 30.3 months for women on chemotherapy alone.

Avastin is the first drug that has 
been shown to improve outcomes for women with advanced ovarian cancer in
 recent years and can halt the progression of first-line disease for an 
average of an additional six months, compared to chemotherapy alone.

Data
 was presented at the European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO)
 meeting in Liverpool from the international phase III ICON7 study of 
1,528 ovarian cancer patients, which included 46 trial centres in the 
UK.

Study leader oncologist Dr Tim Perren, from Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said: ‘The improvements in overall survival for women with high risk advanced ovarian cancer treated with Avastin are a real breakthrough.

‘We already knew Avastin delays the time to disease progression for women with this disease.

‘We now know Avastin also significantly extends some patient’s lives. Avastin is well tolerated and although treatment has to continue for a total of 12 months this is acceptable to most patients.

‘Ovarian cancer currently has the worst outcomes of all gynaecological cancers and halting disease progression for six months is an important step forward in treating this condition.’

Annwen Jones, chief executive of Target Ovarian Cancer charity said: ‘This new survival data for women treated with Avastin, who have the highest risk of their ovarian cancer recurring, is extremely positive.

‘Avastin is the first new life-extending drug in 20 years, and could potentially benefit up to 2,000 women a year in the UK.

We hope that National Institute of Health and Care Excellence and the Scottish Medicines Consortium will now reconsider their earlier negative decisions on the drug and work with the manufacturer to secure NHS access for all those who could benefit.

‘Women in England are given access to the drug currently through the Cancer Drugs Fund, but those living in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have no such guarantees.

‘We believe women should get the drug according to clinical need and not their postcode, and we hope this new data will help strengthen equality of access.’

Avastin, made by Roche which is also known as bevacizumab, is already widely used in patients with colon cancer, and doctors believe it will become a standard treatment for ovarian cancer.

Avastin is a ‘targeted’ cancer therapy that works by blocking the development of new blood vessels and interfering with the tumour’s ability to grow and spread to other parts of the body.
