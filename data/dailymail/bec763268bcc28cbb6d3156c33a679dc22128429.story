The Muslim peer who quit the Cabinet last week has launched an extraordinary attack on David Cameron and the Conservative Party.

In an outspoken onslaught against her fellow Tories, Sayeeda Warsi condemned the ‘public school’ allies around the Prime Minister.

She branded Tory Ministers the ‘bitchiest’ people she has ever known, who dismissed her as ‘a brown, working-class woman’ who was ‘not good enough’ to be a Minister.

In her newspaper attack on Mr Cameron’s inner circle, she added: ‘I don’t hold the fact that someone went to public school against them. I don’t hold the fact that they haven’t had the breadth of experience that some of us who didn’t go to public school have had.’

Baroness Warsi resigned as a Foreign Office Minister after branding Mr Cameron’s policy on Gaza ‘morally indefensible’. Yesterday, she called on Mr Cameron to ‘recognise Palestine as a state’ and impose an arms embargo on Israel. But her plea was combined with a fierce attack on Chancellor George Osborne who last week claimed that her resignation was ‘unnecessary’.

She said: ‘My actions would not have been necessary if he had done what he should have done, which is pick up the phone to people he is incredibly close to and say, “It’s unnecessary for you to meet your ends by taking out power stations, taking out homes, taking out schools and killing kids on beaches.” ’

A No 10 source said: ‘As the Prime Minister (right) made clear in his letter to Baroness Warsi (second left) last week, he valued her contribution as a Minister – and before that in opposition – and was disappointed by her decision to resign' (With Samantha Cameron, second right, and Fiona Hodgson, Conservative conference chairman

And rounding on the critics who criticised her for ‘flouncing’ out of the Cabinet and claimed she was not up to the job, she declared: ‘Some of the bitchiest women I’ve ever met in my life are the men in politics. I am a brown, working-class woman from the North. People have been telling me I’m not good enough since the day I was born.’

A No 10 source said: ‘As the Prime Minister made clear in his letter to Baroness Warsi last week, he valued her contribution as a Minister – and before that in opposition – and was disappointed by her decision to resign.’

Last night, Tory MP Glyn Davies criticised Baroness Warsi’s personal attacks. He said: ‘While many people would have understood her resignation last week, combining it now with these sort of political remarks only devalues her position.’
