National Center for HIV/AIDS, Dermatology and STDs (NCHADS), where she 
praised the country for its efforts in fighting the spread of HIV/AIDS.

Chelsea
 met with some 50 NCHADS staff and then held a news conference where she
 highlighted the progress made by the Cambodian authorities.

'I would like to thank Cambodia 
for being an example and effectively a challenge to the rest of the 
global community,' she said.

'I would also like to recognize Cambodia for not 
mistaking progress for success and I think that is similarly a very real
 and rare achievement, that Cambodia has come so far and it is still so 
singularly focused on eliminating new HIV/AIDS cases by 2020 including 
eliminating effectively mother to child transmission is remarkable,' she
 told a news conference.

On Tuesday, during her time in Malaysia, said she plans
 to become increasingly involved in the international health projects of
 her father's foundation and to speak out for gay rights.

Chelsea said on the sidelines of a women's conference in Malaysia's main city 
that she hopes to return to Southeast Asia, specifically Myanmar, where 
the foundation will work with authorities to distribute medicine and 
health products, including HIV drugs and child vaccines, at cheaper 
prices.

Greetings: Chelsea shakes hands with Mean Chhi Vun (L), Cambodian director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Dermatology and STD, upon her arrival at his office

Chelsea visited Myanmar earlier this 
week at the start of initiative to provide water purification packets to
 areas with unsafe water supplies.

Her mother, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, made a 
groundbreaking visit to Myanmar in 2011 and helped nudge an elected 
government toward democratic reforms.

'I
 hope to go back soon' to Myanmar, Chelsea said. 'My father and my 
husband are quite jealous now because my mother and I both have been to 
the country, and they have not.'

'My goal is always to do as much as I can in whatever area I'm working in,' she said.

She
 added that besides the Clinton Foundation's initiatives, she was 
committed to supporting gay rights, including marriage equality.

'It just seems so fundamental to me. I'm able to marry the person I wanted to marry,' Chelsea said.

'That's the fundamental human imperative. Those of us who have been lucky enough should expand these rights to others.'
