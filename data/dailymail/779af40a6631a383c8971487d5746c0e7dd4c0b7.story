Guilty: Mahmoud Abdel Salam Omar acknowledged he kissed the woman on the lips and neck and touched her breasts after she brought tissues to his Pierre hotel room

A prominent Egyptian banker today pleaded guilty to kissing a hotel maid and groping her breasts, as she sued him for $5million.

Mahmoud Abdel Salam Omar acknowledged he kissed the woman on the lips and neck and touched her breasts after she brought tissues to his room at the posh Pierre hotel in New York.

The 74-year-old chairman of state-run
salt production firm El-Mex Salines Co. has already spent five days of 
community service in a soup kitchen.

His case will be closed without jail time or probation if he stays out of trouble for a year.

His lawyer, Lori Cohen, called the case the result of a 'big miscommunication' between the 44-year-old maid and Omar.

While he acknowledged in court that 
he knew he didn't have the woman's consent for his advances, Cohen said 
he thought the housekeeper was receptive.

'I believe he thought something was 
happening that wasn't,' she said. 'I think his lack of a great 
understanding of English, and her desire to file a multimillion-dollar 
lawsuit, led to these accusations.'

The
woman's assault and false-imprisonment lawsuit, filed in federal court,
says Omar also rubbed his groin against her legs and groped her 
buttocks.

In
the lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court the woman has asked for 
$1million for each of the three counts Omar was charged with.

She also asked a judge to grant her a $2million punitive damage award, bringing the total to $5 million.

Her lawyer didn't immediately return a telephone message, but prosecutors said she was satisfied with Omar's plea deal.

Fighting back: The maid, who accused former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn of raping her in his hotel room, has hired a lawyer in France to help track down other potential victims of the 62-year-old

Suffering: The maid embroiled in the Strauss-Khan case who cannot be identified for legal reasons, is also expected to seek substantial damages

Omar, a former bank chairman, initially faced a felony sexual abuse charge that carried up to seven years in prison.

After interviewing numerous witnesses and reviewing surveillance video and forensic evidence, prosecutors concluded the incident 'did not rise to the level of forcible compulsion,' which would have to be proven for the felony charge, Manhattan assistant district attorney Nicole Blumberg said.

Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly had said the case could be complicated to prosecute.

Although the maid told a superior immediately that she had been attacked, the supervisor waited until the next morning to alert the hotel's security director, who then told police.

The hotel suspended the supervisor and promised to buy 'panic buttons' for maids to alert managers if they are attacked.

Omar's lawyer said he might well have chosen to go to trial but was eager to get home to his wife, who has recently had surgery.

'This was the most expeditious way for him to return home,' she said.

Meanwhile the maid, who accused 
former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn of raping her in his hotel room,
has hired a lawyer in France to help track down other potential victims
of the 62-year-old.

The 32-year-old maid, who accused 
Strauss-Khan of assault while in his $3,000-a-night suite at New York's 
Sofitel Hotel in May, is also expected to seek damages.

She has added French lawyer, Thibault de Montbrial, to her growing legal team.

Montbrial said he was hired to contact other 'victims' of Strauss-Khan, according to the New York Post.

Strauss-Khan
is currently under house arrest in New York following his arrest. He 
has pleaded not guilty to charges including attempted rape.
