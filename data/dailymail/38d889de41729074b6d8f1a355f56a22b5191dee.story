A 59-year-old man died after being left bleeding from the head on a subway platform while more than 40 bystanders ignored him.

Radil Hebrich stumbled into the path of an oncoming metro carriage, and was knocked onto the yellow safety line, inches from the tracks. His breathing stopped and blood poured from his head.

But fellow passengers, as well as employees on Montreal's underground transit system, walked on by.

Bleeding out: Radil Hebrich,  59, was ignored by dozens of passengers as he lay dying on a platform in Montreal's subway system

Could have killed him: A coroner noted that the 19 minutes it took Hebrich to get help could have contributed to his death

Hebrich, who was drunk, was hit early in the morning. Security footage shows most passers-by either staring at or ignoring him.

One is seen going through his pockets, though he did not check his physical condition, the Montreal Gazette reported.

It took sixteen minutes in total for paramedic to arrive on the scene at Langelier station, and three minutes more for them to start helping him.

In that time, three more metro trains passed Hebrich's slumped corpse. Two kept going, while a third may have called 911. 

He was declared dead the same night at a nearby hospital after the accident in January 2014.

'Apathy': The official criticized those around Hebrich for lacking the decency to help him, or call 911

Footage of the agonizing wait was used to investigate his death but not widely released. 

The coroner investigating Hebrich's death indicated that the 'apathy' of the dozens of people around him may have sealed his fate.

He told CBC News: 'If you're 19 minutes without CPR … it does not help your chances.'

'As for the indifference of the passengers... it says a lot about citizen apathy in our society. There is not much positive to write about this operation.'
