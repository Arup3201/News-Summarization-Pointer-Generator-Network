Sarah Palin mocked President Barack Obama on Monday for his response to the Russia-Ukraine crisis, saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin's expansionist moves have been enabled by a White House that projects weakness.

'People are looking at Putin as one who wrestles bears and drills for oil,' the former Republican Governor of Alaska told Fox News host Sean Hannity. 'They look at our president as one who wears mom jeans.'

Palin argued that economic and trade sanctions against Moscow would be useless against a Russian leader who's intent on rebuilding the Soviet Union one annexation at a time.

'Anyone who carries the commonsense gene would know that Putin doesn’t change his stripes,' she said. 'He wants to exert huge power and dominance, so he has to get to those border areas and he has to capture them.'

Palin grabbed the media spotlight with a 'told-ya-so' moment over the weekend by pointing out on Facebook that she had predicted Putin's Ukraine invasion six years ago.

The one-time vice presidential candidate wrote a strongly worded post on Friday calling out her liberal critics for mocking her.

'Yes,
 I could see this one from Alaska,' Palin wrote. 'I'm usually not one to
 Told-Ya-So, but I did, despite my accurate prediction being derided as 
“an extremely far-fetched scenario” by the “high-brow” Foreign Policy 
magazine.'

During the 2008 presidential campaign, Foreign Policy published an article 
ridiculing her prediction that if then-Senator Barack Obama is elected 
into office, Russia under President Vladimir Putin would be emboldened to occupy 
Ukraine.

Palin's statements on the campaign 
trail came during an armed conflict that broke out between Russia and 
Georgia over the contested territory of South Ossetia.

‘After the Russian Army invaded the 
nation of Georgia, Senator Obama's reaction was one of indecision and 
moral equivalence, the kind of response that would only encourage 
Russia's Putin to invade Ukraine next,’ Palin told a crowd at a rally 
held in Reno, Nevada, in October 2008.

Palin's gloating Facebook post has been shared more than 18,000 times and has drawn more than 72,000 'likes.'

Speaking to Fox News' Todd Starnes, Palin said: 'We can expect more of this sort of thing in a world where America is gutting its military and “leading from behind.”’

Meanwhile, conservative talk radio host Mark Levin tweeted: 'Palin not only knows where Russia is, but she knew what Putin would do to Ukraine with Obama as president.'

Palin's self-congratulatory Facebook message comes as Russia appears to be poised on deploying ground forces across Ukraine, ostensibly to protect Russian nationals from ongoing violence, in the words of President Vladimir Putin.

Speaking at a press conference on the crisis in Ukraine, President Obama has warned that 'there will be costs' if Russia invades the neighboring country, where pro-Russian and pro-European Union factions have been fighting in the streets for the past month.

Palin is set to address the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday near Washington, D.C.
