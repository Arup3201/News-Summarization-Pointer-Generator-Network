More than 30 years later, images of the dead soldiers and their horses lying on the ground in Hyde Park remain seared on the national consciousness.

Yesterday a man stood in the dock accused of carrying out the bombing, one of the IRA's most notorious mainland attacks.

John Downey, 61, was charged with slaughtering four members of the Blues and Royals, part of the Household Cavalry, as they rode from their barracks to the Changing of the Guard ceremony at Buckingham Palace.

In the dock: A 61-year-old man has appeared in court charged with the murder of four soldiers in the 1982 Hyde Park bomb. John Anthony Downey is pictured arriving at court in a police escorted van

Accused: The short hearing took place at Westminster Magistrates' Court. Downey spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address

He was dramatically arrested at 
Gatwick airport on Sunday after leaving his remote bolthole in an Irish 
village to go on holiday.

As well as the four soldiers, seven 
horses died and 50 people were injured in the attack in July 1982. One 
of the horses, Sefton, suffered 38 wounds after being peppered with 
shrapnel, but survived.

Less than two hours later, a second explosion in a Regents Park bandstand killed seven Royal Green Jackets bandsmen. 

It is understood that Scotland Yard 
knew of Downey's movements and set up an operation to arrest him at 
Gatwick as he arrived on a flight from the Irish Republic.

Some relatives of the soldiers who 
died in Hyde Park â€“ Roy Bright, Dennis Daly, Simon Tipper and Geoffrey 
Young â€“ were contacted by police several weeks ago to warn them of 
'developments' in the case.

Yesterday Nichola Wyatt, the widow of Lieutenant Daly, said the bombing 'devastated the lives of everybody involved'.

She added: 'Although people have moved
 on in different ways, the feeling of loss never goes away and the 
arrest of John Downey will not change that. His arrest after such a long
 period of time has come as something of a shock.' Downey was charged 
yesterday with murdering the four soldiers and 'intending to cause an 
explosion likely to endanger life'. The allegations only relate to the 
Hyde Park bomb.

He was flanked by two prison officers when he appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court yesterday.

In a soft Irish accent, grey-haired Downey spoke only to confirm his name and address before surveying the packed courtroom.

He sat in the dock in an open-necked 
shirt and grey pullover and ran his hands through his scruffy beard. 
District Judge Quentin Purdy remanded Downey in custody for a bail 
hearing at the Old Bailey tomorrow.

Downey has been living in a bungalow 
in Creeslough, County Donegal. One neighbour said: 'He bought the house a
 few years ago and has been living there with his wife and two children,
 who must be in their late 20s or early 30s.

'He was big into horses and may have kept some at a stables. He kept a low profile but people knew of his background.

Awful: This picture shows the chaotic scenes following the bombing

Michael Pedersen, a former cavalryman who survived the IRA bomb, knifed his two young children to death before killing himself. He is pictured right with Sefton the horse injured in the IRA bombing

'He was living openly, under his own 
name. All we know is that he left on Sunday to go on holiday. That is 
the last we saw of him.'

Downey has been repeatedly named as a 
prime suspect for the bombing. He played cat and mouse with the 
authorities as the Irish government refused to extradite him, citing 
questions over the quality of police evidence. Scotland Yard issued an 
identikit picture of him, in which he had thick dark hair. Downey 
eventually settled in the village of Ballyshannon, in County Donegal, 
where he lived openly and was tracked down by several newspapers in the 
1980s.

Three of the cavalrymen were killed in
 Hyde Park and the fourth died three days later. The nail bomb was 
hidden inside a blue Austin car parked along a route regularly used by 
the Household Cavalry. The other soldiers in the procession were badly 
wounded and shrapnel and nails also sprayed a crowd of tourists who had 
gathered to watch.

Sefton, the horse that survived, went 
on to become a TV star. Last year in a tragic postscript, Michael 
Pedersen, who was riding Sefton at the time of the bombing and later 
appeared on TV with him, killed himself and his two young children.

Pedersen, 51, is said to have been 
involved in an angry break-up from the children's mother a few weeks 
before he stabbed his son and daughter to death. It remains to be seen 
whether the Good Friday Agreement, which led to the early release of 
many IRA terrorists, will apply to Downey if he is convicted.

In 1987, Gilbert 'Danny' McNamee, an 
electrician from Northern Ireland, was charged with making the Hyde Park
 bomb and jailed for 25 years. He served 12 years before being freed 
under the terms of the Good Friday peace deal.

In 1998 his conviction was quashed at the High Court.
