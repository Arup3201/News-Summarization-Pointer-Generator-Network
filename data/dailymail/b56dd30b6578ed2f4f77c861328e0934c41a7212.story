Top
 BBC executives are spending tens of thousands of pounds of licence 
fee-payers’ money on ‘champagne and seabass’ meals with each other at exclusive restaurants.

The
 lunches and dinners – described in BBC accounts as ‘editorial meetings’
 – contributed to a total inter-executive wining and dining bill of 
more than  £30,000 last year.

One £155,000-a-year executive has managed to notch up a personal dining tally of more than £11,000 over the past four years.

According to documents and 
receipts released by the BBC, there were 269 claims for executives 
dining with each other last year, which amounts to more than one for 
every working day. Each claim cost more than £100 on average.

The
 biggest claimant was David Holdsworth, the controller of English 
regions, who has spent £11,050 on wining and dining since 2010.

The
 second most lavish spender was Peter Johnston, the £152,000-a-year 
director of BBC Northern Ireland, who spent £5,185, while Roger Wright, 
the £227,000-a-year controller of Radio 3, spent £4,758.

Receipts
 from some of these ‘meetings’ show how convivial they can be. Gwyneth 
Williams, the £183,000-a-year controller of Radio 4, enjoyed glasses of 
Champagne Billecart-Salmon, Chablis and seabass at an ‘editorial/leaving
 lunch’ in May 2012 with Mary Kalemkerian, the former head of 
programming for Radio 4. 

Ben
 Gale, the former head of Bristol Factual, billed £79.45 for a 
‘programme development meeting’ at a Bristol restaurant which included a
 31-day dry-aged fillet steak – served on a lava rock heated to 500F – 
costing more than £28 with a sauce.

And
 another meeting, between Ken MacQuarrie and Rhodri Talfan-Davies, the 
heads of BBC Scotland and Wales, was held at the Royal Dragon in Soho, 
Central London, where they  enjoyed the Peking set dinner and six Asahi 
beers.

The executives dined out at the restaurants even though they can choose from 166 meeting rooms at New Broadcasting House.

Figures show that since 2010,
 the ‘internal hospitality’ spend by top executives has risen from 
£19,181 to £30,350 –  an average of £1,017 a year for those who 
submitted claims.

The 
executives also received another perk: the BBC spent a total of 
£7.8 million on paying tax bills incurred by employees on perks such as 
taxis and meals.

Last 
night, a BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC employs 20,000 people and this 
expenditure, released under our disclosure rules, equates to £1.50 per 
person, per year.

‘Like
 many other UK businesses, the BBC pays tax on certain taxable benefits,
 such as the cost  of ensuring staff can travel home safely late at 
night.’
