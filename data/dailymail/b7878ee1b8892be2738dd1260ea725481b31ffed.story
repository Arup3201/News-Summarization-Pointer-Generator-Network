X Factor wannabes enjoyed the free booze on board a BA flight back to Gatwick after performing at Mel B's house in Mexico that airline staff had to close the bar, according to reports.

The male contestants, who were travelling from Cancun after performing at the Spice Girl's pad, allegedly made so much noise on the night flight, stewards were forced to get involved.

It is claimed that passengers were left disgruntled by the rowdy antics and the men 'knocking back drinks like they were going out of fashion'.

Judges' houses: The male contestants allegedly made good use of the free booze on board a BA flight to the UK from Mexico after performing for Mel B 

The six contestants had been banned from drinking during the six days they spent at Mel B's house - where they performed in front of the Spice Girl and sidekick Emma Bunton.

However, passengers said the singers made up for it on board the British Airways flight.

A passenger told The Sun: 'These boys were on a mission as soon as they got on the plane.

'They started ordering as many drinks as they could and were knocking them back like they were going out of fashion.'

Bosses on the show, which pulls in 9.2 million viewers, were reported to be unhappy with the boys' behaviour - but a spokesman denied this to MailOnline Travel.

A spokesman said: 'There was no bad behaviour or fracas on the flight, nor any were there any complaints from any other passengers.'

A spokesman for BA said: 'There were no reports of untoward behaviour on the flight.'

X Factor will be screened three times in one week later this month with an extra edition lined up to clash with the launch night of Strictly Come Dancing as rivalry between the shows hots up.

ITV bosses said they had had to add an extra Friday night show as a result of other shows on the network which have squeezed the time available.
