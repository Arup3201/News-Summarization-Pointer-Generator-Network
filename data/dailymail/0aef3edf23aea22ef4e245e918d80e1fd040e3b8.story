Doorknobs have been banned in Vancouver, Canada and many residents are up in arms over the new nanny-state rule.

Starting next March, the city will be requiring the installation of lever handles on all new building doors instead of round doorknobs.

The City Council passed the new code in September in an attempt to make the city more accessible to the disabled and elderly.

Out with the old, in with the new: The Vancouver City Council amended its building code to ban doorknobs (left) in favor of lever handles (right) to make housing more elderly-friendly

The change was part of the council's 'age-friendly action plan'. In addition to the door handle requirement, the city has passed similar building requirements such as wider door frames, faucet levers and minimum height standards for electrical outlets to create 'a more safe, inclusive and engaging city for all seniors'.

With Americans and Canadians living longer, age-related issues are coming to the forefront especially as the Baby Boomer generation enters retirement. According to the CDC, 67 million adult Americans will have arthritis by 2030.

'Technology changes. Things change. We live with that,' Will Johnston, the city's former chief building inspector, told the Vancouver Sun. 'When I look at what we are proposing, it is simply good design. It allows for homes to be built that can be used more easily for everybody.'

The new code isn't retroactive and doesn't apply to current buildings, but it has still angered many who don't like the idea of their government dictating such a minor detail in their homes.

'I can understand if you have a public building where everybody wants to have free access and that is a problem,' said Allen Joslyn, president of the antique door knob collectors of America. 'But to say that when I build my private home and nobody is disabled that I have to put levers on, strikes me as overreach.'

Foreshadowing: Leading up to the vote, all of the Art Deco doorknobs in Vancouver City Hall were swapped out for gold levers

Vancouver councilman Geoff Meggs admits that the measure 'went through very quietly' but isn't sorry it's now a part of the building code.

'This is all about [enhancing] accessibility, and it's something we're going to keep doing. I'm not going to apologize for that,' Mr Meggs told the National Post.

Signs of change led up to the vote in September when all of the Art Deco door knobs in Vancouver City Hall were removed and replaced with gold door levels.

Mr Meggs says the city has been fielding calls about the latest change to the building code, but that most are people asking about where they can purchase the old City Hall door knobs.

While the rule applies only to single-family homes and townhouses in city limits, the Vancouver Sun hypothesized that the change would effect all of Canada. Since Vancouver is the only Canadian city with its own building code, it is used as an example for other towns and cities in the country.
