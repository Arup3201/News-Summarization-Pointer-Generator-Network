Stopped: Jules Mattsson, pictured, was prevented from taking pictures at a military parade

A police inspector tried to block a teenager taking photos at a public event in a town centre saying it was 'silly' and 'gay' and 'stupid'.

Officers prevented Jules Mattsson - then 15 - from taking pictures at a military parade in Romford, east London, in June 2010.

The Metropolitan Police said compensation had been paid and an apology issued.

Law firm Bindmans, which represented 
the youngster, said a police inspector had described photographing in 
public as 'anti-social behaviour'.

'On
 26 June 2010, (Jules), at the time a 15-year-old student, was 
photographing the Armed Forces Day parade in Romford,' said a spokesman 
for Bindmans.

'Despite 
the public event taking place in the middle of the town centre, 
Metropolitan Police officers claimed it was unlawful to photograph the 
parade. The officers, led by an inspector, insisted he stopped taking 
photographs.

'The inspector told (Jules) he was a public hazard and said that photographing in public was 'anti-social behaviour'.

'He described the act of taking photographs as 'silly' and 'gay' and 'stupid''.

The lawyer continued: 'When (Jules) continued to state the lawfulness of his behaviour, the inspector declared it was 'dangerous' as he was 'likely to be trampled on by soldiers' from the parade.'

Solicitor Chez Cotton, head of the police misconduct department at Bindmans, said: 'The police had no legal power to stop him photographing in a public place. The inspector attempted to justify his actions in shocking and absurd ways.'

Ms Cotton added: 'The treatment of the police towards our client, a 15-year-old, was shocking. The inspector's comments were designed to belittle.

'Our client politely and reasonably maintained that the police were not entitled to interfere with his right to report.

'In response the inspector used serious anti-terrorism legislation, cynically telling Mr Mattsson 'I consider you a threat under the Terrorism Act young man. I've had enough'.

'The police have no legal power or moral responsibility to prevent or restrict what journalists record.

'It is unacceptable that the police interfered with (Jules') right to report in any event, but for officers to attempt to intimidate a young reporter in this way is deplorable.

'It is right the commissioner has promptly apologised and paid a suitable level of damages.'

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'The ... Directorate of Legal Services, on behalf of the commissioner, agreed an out-of-court settlement, as well as paying compensation and meeting legal costs for a 16-year-old male, following an incident where he was prevented by officers taking pictures at the Armed Forces Parade in Romford on 26 June 2010.

'An apology has also been issued.'
