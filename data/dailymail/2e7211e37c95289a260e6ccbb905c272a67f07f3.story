Three siblings have been hailed Britain's most devoted pupils - after they all finished school without ever having a day off.

Dedicated Chloe, Daniel and Holly Ghent have a 100 per cent attendance record in class - without once skiving or taking a sickie over a 12 year period - a staggering 7,000 days.

Holly, 20, Daniel, 18, and Chloe, 16, all went to the same primary and secondary schools in Hanham, Bristol, but never missed a single day.

Daniel did have a near miss and nearly ruined their perfect record after suffering a burst appendix - but 'luckily' that was during the summer holidays.

Chloe is the latest sibling to emerge from school with a perfect record - after finishing classes last week ahead of her GCSE exams.

The sporty siblings, of Bristol, put their impressive attendance record down to a love of classes - and hardy immune systems.

Proud mum Janet, 54, said she never had any trouble getting the kids out of bed and into school.

She said: 'They all had chicken pox when they were at playgroup, so that was out of the way before they started school.

'They had the usual coughs and colds but were able to keep going. They seem to like the atmosphere.

'They have all got involved in lots of after-school clubs and activities. I think it was just luck, really.

'They were ill from time to time but it just seemed to be at weekends or during the holidays.

'As each one got through infant school without missing a day we thought it would be nice if they could continue like that and do it for all their schooling.'

The siblings all attended Hanham High and Christchurch Primary School.

Daniel said: 'My older sister did it first so I thought I would see if I could do it too. I was never really that ill that I had to stay off, and I was mostly just ill at the weekends.'

Chloe added: 'I was just never that ill.'

Daniel is training to be a doctor, Holly is currently at Cardiff University and Chloe will only return to school for her exams.

Mrs Ghent is a cook at a nursery school so is unable to take holidays in term time, and says husband Steve, a bank manager, would never consider taking the kids out of school.

She said: 'My mum and dad never took me out and I wouldn't think of doing it. The children could miss an awful lot of school and it might be hard to catch up.

'In the last few years there's always been one of them doing important exams.'

In 2010 a 16-year-old  was dubbed Britain's most devoted pupil after going through his entire school life without a single day off.

Stephen Booth, from Stoke-on-Trent, kept up his perfect attendance record for an impressive 12 years - battling through coughs and colds without missing a second of his favourite subjects.

Stephen hadn't had a day off sick since he was four-years-old, when he had a contagious bug, but even then the was itching to get back to his science lessons.

He said: 'I've just never been ill, I've never been so bad that I've needed a day off. I like school and I want to do well.

'I want to get good grades, and my friends are there, I really enjoy the environment, I'm very proud of it.

'If I am ill, it's generally only during school holidays. It's just been a stroke of luck. My friends have had a laugh and joke with me about my attendance being so good.'
