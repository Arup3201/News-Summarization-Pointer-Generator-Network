Grandmother Teresa Meehan, 75, pictured with Rambo, was investigated by police for 'stealing' her own cat

When grandmother Teresa Meehan found her missing tomcat after four traumatic months of searching, she was overjoyed.

But she could never have known that the return of Rambo would spark a police probe, a bitter custody battle, a mischievous poster campaign and an MP’s intervention – all over the pet that was rightfully hers.

Widow Mrs Meehan, 75, had owned the two-year-old black cat since he was just five weeks old, and she was heartbroken when he disappeared in February.

But just four months later, he suddenly appeared at her bungalow in Plymouth.

‘It was ironic, because I thought I’d never see Rambo again [and] I’d just been approved by an animal shelter to have another cat when he came back,’ she said.

‘When the lady from the shelter said we should see if Rambo had been living with someone else I thought nothing of it. He was in excellent condition and had clearly been looked after by someone.’

A check revealed Rambo had been microchipped by a new owner, who had renamed him Butch after finding him at Plymouth Cat Rescue centre. But he didn’t get on with her other cat, and she didn’t want him back.

Relieved, Mrs Meehan thought that was the end of the matter. But a week later she received a call from the police, who told her she was being investigated for the theft of Rambo.

‘At the same time, “Free Butch” posters [were put up] around the area with photos of Rambo on them claiming he’d been stolen,’ she said. ‘They said he was being “held by a woman in Eggbuckland”, the area of Plymouth where I live, and they even offered £100 for his safe return.’

Over the next three weeks, three police officers were dispatched to investigate the custody case surrounding Rambo, and Mrs Meehan claims they contacted her ‘countless times’.

Tomcat Rambo was adopted by new owners, who renamed him Butch and microchipped, after he went missing for four months

The dispute began when Rambo’s new owner – the one listed on his microchip – decided she did want him back after all. Mrs Meehan said: ‘Naturally I was extremely upset as Rambo is happy living with me.’

Distressed at the posters, which featured Plymouth Cat Rescue’s name on the top, Mrs Meehan hired a solicitor to write to the shelter and ask for their removal.

She also complained to Devon and Cornwall’s police and crime commissioner, Tony Hogg. She said: ‘A few years ago I had a burglary on my home ... but the police didn’t even bother to attend.

‘I said investigating me for the theft of my own cat was a waste of time and money.’ In desperation, Mrs Meehan even asked Plymouth’s Labour MP Alison Seabeck to intervene.

Mrs Seabeck said: ‘This has been a distressing case for all concerned. But I am satisfied the police have taken this case seriously ... and that Rambo is happily living with his rightful owner.’

But Mrs Meehan said she is still terrified to let Rambo out of the house, in case she loses him again. No one at Plymouth Cat Rescue was available to comment.
