The British poinsettia could be in short supply this Christmas because growers have been hit by soaring energy costs and competition from cheaper, inferior foreign plants.

For millions of families, the distinctive plant – Britain’s second most popular pot plant after the orchid – is a festive staple.

But delicate poinsettias need carefully controlled temperatures of between 15C (59F) and 20C (68F) and rocketing fuel bills have driven some UK growers out of business.

Christmas favourites: For millions of families, the distinctive plant - Britain¿s second most popular pot plant after the orchid - is a festive staple. But many UK growers have pulled out of producing the delicate crop

They are now producing around a 
million fewer than five years ago and shoppers are increasingly having 
to buy imports from Holland. Many Dutch nurseries are backed by 
subsidies to help install energy-efficient heating.

Horticultural experts say Dutch poinsettias have weaker stems, fewer branches and are less hardy.

British
 growers devote 18 to 20 weeks to cultivating the plant while the Dutch 
spend only 12 to 15 - and transporting it by lorry from Holland takes 
its toll too.

Roundstone 
Nurseries, of Almodington, West Sussex, had been growing 200,000 
poinsettias a year for Sainsbury’s and Marks & Spencer.

But bosses have decided to stop after the energy bill to grow its plants last year was more than £50,000. Roundstone managing director Peter Cook said that they are now growing cyclamen instead.

'Energy
 use for poinsettia is very intensive for a number of months,' he said. 
'Heating costs were £50,000-plus - a big investment - because they’re a 
tropical plant and you have to have them at 20C to make them feel comfy.

'Poinsettia
 turned out to be a risky crop. It is highly unlikely we will revisit 
that crop as the cyclamen programme we replaced it with is more 
profitable.

'With cyclamen, we’re not looking at huge gas bill.

'We’re sorry because so many customers want to buy British poinsettias but we have made the right decision for our business.'

Thing of the past: The poinsettia Christmas crop at Roundstone nurseries last year. The firm has now decided to pull out of growing the plants after rising energy costs made it too difficult to make a profit

Ian Riggs, chairman of the British Protected Ornamentals Association, a trade body for British growers, said that poinsettia production among members has slumped.

Temperamental poinsettias need specific conditions – but treat yours well and it could bloom again next Christmas.

He said: 'Poinsettias have become one of those things on the Christmas shopping list that people expect like turkey and a Christmas tree.

'But there will be fewer British poinsettias available this year and garden centres and supermarkets can always go to Holland.

'We are talking about diminishing choice and people may end up buying Dutch and Belgian poinsettias.

'Poinsettias are a heat hungry crop. You cannot compromise on the temperature if you are going to grow a quality crop.

'And if growers see that last year’s fuel bill was high, that is what they base their decision on.

'A lot of growers have switched to cyclamen.'

Mr Riggs said that British growers lavish much more attention on their crops than their Dutch counterparts.

'The British start growing earlier in June or July and have a lower density of crop - around nine plants per square metre compared to 15 in Holland,' he said.

'It means that they have more branches than Dutch poinsettias, which are more upright.

'And any British grower will tell you that theirs is a better plant because it spends less time in a lorry and is less tightly packed in boxes than the Dutch, who are mindful of their transport costs.'

It is a very similar tale of woe nationwide for British poinsettia growers.

Pinewood Nurseries, of Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, has halved production this year from 50,000 to 25,000 after poring over fuel bills.

Coletta & Tyson, near Hull, used to be one of the country’s biggest growers that supplied 500,000 poinsettias to Sainsbury’s and Asda.

But it gave up production in 2011 with director Paul Tyson citing 'spiralling energy costs'.

Waddesdon Plant Centre, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, also grew the plant for many years but stopped because it was no longer viable.

Poinsettias originate from Mexico and were once tall, fragile and mostly seen only in the houses of the wealthy.

But hardier dwarf strains appeared in the Sixties and their popularity has soared since the Eighties.

They are also a festive favourite in the US, Australia and Europe but Germans like cream, purple and oranges as well as red.
