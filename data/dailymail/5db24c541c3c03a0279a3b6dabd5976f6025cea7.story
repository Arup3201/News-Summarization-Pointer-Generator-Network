The birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's baby has been one of the most keenly awaited of the decade and 
well-wishers no doubt wish to shower the tiny prince with gifts.

But Kate and William have asked for donations 
to charity rather than wasteful gifts, and expectant parents across the UK are endorsing the Royal couple's frugal approach.

Rather than engraved spoons, flowers and pretty trinkets, it is 
practical items that expectant parents want to receive on the birth of a
new child, according to research.

Practical parents: Kate and William have asked for donations to charity rather than wasteful gifts, and expectant parents are doing the same, according to new research

On the birth of a child, 72 per cent of couples say they prefer practical items that will help money go a little further.

Gifts such as clothing, multi-store gift cards and even nappies are being welcomed, while only one in 10 couples would welcome more frivolous gifts such as bouquets of flowers or keepsakes. 

And even those who do think practically admit there are still problems when receiving this sort of gift:  eight per cent of new parents admit even practical gifts end up being wasted because of the number of duplicate presents they receive.  

Clothing is the top item on the 'wasted' list, due to clothing for newborns quickly becoming too small and parents receiving many of the same item.

Frugal: Following the Cambridges' lead, gifts such as clothing, multi-store gift cards and even nappies are being welcomed, whereas only 1 in 10 couples would welcome more frivolous gifts such as bouquets or keepsakes

A spokesman for One4all who carried out the survey, said: 'Kate and Will have read the public mood perfectly. Although this baby will have a luxury lifestyle, they are clearly trying to avoid signs of unnecessary excess.

'Our research indicates this will go down well with parents in the UK who are also taking a more practical approach and avoiding waste.

'Most people will spend between £20 and £40 on a present to mark a baby’s birth, and given the large number of gifts that people receive when a child is born, that could easily be £400 or £500 in gifts.'
