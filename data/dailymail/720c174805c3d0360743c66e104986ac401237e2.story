Barack Obama was cheered as he waved to crowds at Nelson Mandela's memorial service in Johannesburg after missing the opening speeches when his motorcade apparently got stuck in traffic.

The President was greeted with a rapturous ovation when he arrived around an hour late at the FNB Stadium to pay tribute to the former South African leader.

Pictures showed Mr Obama's motorcade stuck in long queues of traffic as he made his way from Pretoria where Air Force One landed to Johannesburg for the ceremony.

Obama and First Lady Michelle waved to crowds who cheered when their picture appeared on large screens around the venue as the pair took their seats.

He was also seen offering condolences to Nelson Mandela's widow Graca Machel and shaking the hand of Cuban counterpart Raul Castro en route to his seat.

The President is leading an American 
delegation that includes former White House incumbents George W Bush, 
his wife Laura, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.

Mr Clinton and his wife Hilary were also late arrivals, with Mr Clinton pictured shaking hands with members of the UK delegation.

Some took to Twitter to express their disappointment that Obama was so late.

Gwen Lister described his delay as 'inappropriate, whatever the cause'.

While another user posted: 'Barack Obama is no longer fashionably late... this is unacceptable.'

When he finally took to the stand to give his speech, Obama described Mr Mandela as the 
'last great liberator of the 20th century' and compared him to Ghandi 
and Martin Luther King in a powerful address to the crowds.

Addressing
 the people of South Africa, he said: 'Thank you for sharing Nelson 
Mandela with us. His struggle was your struggle, his triumph your 
triumph.'

People were baffled as to the whereabouts of Barack Obama on Twitter, with some angry at his apparent lateness

'Your dignity and hope found expression in his life, and your freedom, your democracy is his cherished legacy. '

The President told crowds gathered despite torrential rain: 'He changed views but he also changed hearts.

'For the people of South Africa, for the people he inspired around the globe, his passing is rightly a time of mourning and a time to celebrate his life.

'But I believe it should also be a period of self reflection.

'With honesty, regardless of our station or circumstance, we must ask: how well have I applied his lessons in my own life? It's a question I ask myself as a man and as a President.

'We can't allow our progress to cloud the fact that our struggle is not done.

'We will never see the likes of Nelson Mandela again but let me say to young people in South Africa and around the world, you too can make his life work your own.'

Obama,
 Mr Bush and their wives, and former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton 
all traveled to Johannesburg together on Air Force One.

Mr Clinton, Mr Carter and his wife Rosalynn traveled separately to the event.

Mr Obama is among foreign leaders from all over the world who traveled to pay tribute to Mr Mandela at the stadium which hosted the World Cup Final in 2010 and was the site of Mandela's final public appearance.

Ben Rhodes, White House deputy 
national security adviser for strategic communications, said that the 
President and First lady Michelle had earlier spent time with the Bushes and 
Secretary Clinton on board Air Force One.

They are said to have been reflecting on their experiences meeting Mr Mandela.

Mr Bush visited the press cabin twice for off the record conversations with journalists during the flight.

Mr Clinton meanwhile, traveled separately to his wife Hilary, having made a speech at an event in Rio de Janeiro on Monday. His daughter Chelsea was pictured at the service sitting alongside her parents.

During the flight to South Afirca, the
 Obamas retired to the President's office and regular cabin at the front
 of the plane while former Secretary of State and first lady Hillary 
Clinton was given free reign of the senior staff's cabin and former 
President George W. Bush and Laura were given the medical suite.

That said, the Bushes ended up spending more than an hour in the press cabin at the back of the plane.

Seeing off his hero: Officials revealed Monday that Obama plans to speak at Mandela's mass service, to be held in Johannesburg on Tuesday

The plane's spacious conference room served as a gathering spot for them all during the flight from Maryland to South Africa which is expected to last 16 hours.

President Obama did not spend the entire trip catching up with his fellow politicians but squeezed in some time with them between in-flight meetings and calls.

‘It's a very, I think, enjoyable experience certainly for the president and first lady,’ said White House spokesman Jay Carney.

‘And they're both grateful to be able to have former president and first lady, former secretary of state on board.’

Behind closed doors: President Obama kept hold of his office (pictured during a 2012 flight) and former President Bush and Laura were given the room generally used as the medical office

Gathering space: The conference room is where the the Obamas, Bushes and Hillary Clinton reportedly got together and hung out during the 16-hour flight (President Obama seen here with his staff during an April 2009 trip)

Clinton take over: The former Secretary of State was given free reign for she and her staffers to convene in the area usually allotted to President Obama's senior staff (as seen here in July 2012)

For Bush, the flight marked the first time he had stepped foot on Air Force One since leaving the presidency nearly five years ago.

He and the former first lady were already on board the plane in Washington when Obama arrived, skipping an on-camera greeting with the Obamas.

Bush has purposely tried to stay out of the public eye since leaving office but he wandered back to the plane's press cabin for two lengthy off-the-record conversations with reporters, returning the second time with Laura Bush in tow.

Clinton is no stranger to the presidential plane, having travelled aboard Air Force One frequently as both first lady and secretary of state.

Carter,
 the 40th president of the United States and the earliest-serving of the
 five living Presidents, was part of a conference group that Mandela 
created called 'The Elders' and traveled with some 
others from that group.

George
 H.W. Bush is the only American president who did not attend. His 
spokesman said the 89-year-old is no longer able to travel long 
distances.

The last time 
that all five living former presidents were gathered with their wives 
was for the dedication of George W. Bush's presidential library in 
Dallas this April.

Clearly 
any time that the group is together presents a security threat, but that
 situation is even more difficult to gain control of when the reunion 
takes place abroad.

'The world literally is coming to 
South Africa, I don't think it has ever happened before,' said South 
Africa's head of public diplomacy Clayson Monyela.
