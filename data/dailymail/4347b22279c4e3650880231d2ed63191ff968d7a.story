Accused: Michael Canaii is alleged to have threatened pupils at his daughter's school in New York City with a metal chain

A father allegedly threatened
to batter staff and pupils at his daughter's school with a metal chain 
after demanding to know 'who had been f****** her.'

Michael Canaii is accused of telling pupils he was going to 'f*** [them] all up' after turning up at the High School of Graphic Communication Arts in Manhattan, New York city .

The 35-year-old, who is reported to have been wearing all black at the time, is said to have been worried that his daughter had become involved with gangs.

Mr Canaii complained that his daughter had been smoking cannabis and not listening
to him, and that he wanted the school to do something about it, according to the New York Post.

He is alleged to have insisted on speaking with his daughter when he first showed up at the school at about 9 am yesterday.

'A man was outside with a chain. He was saying, ‘where is my daughter?’ a source told the Post.

'He was swinging the chain saying, ‘I’m going to f*** you all up.' Once inside the school's ground he is alleged to have threatened to fight anyone who confronted him.

Mr Canaii allegedly also asked the school's dean to fight him as he swung the metal chain.

The school's security staff cleared the lobby and blocked students from entering until the police arrived.

Mr Cannai was taken to hospital following his arrest and was arraigned last night in Manhattan Criminal Court.

His lawyer said he had gone to the school because he feared his daughter had become involved in gang activity.

He is accused of criminal possession of a weapon, menacing and possession of cannabis.
