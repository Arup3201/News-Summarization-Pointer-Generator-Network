Two men were shot in Manhattan tonight while skating on the ice rink in Bryant Park.

The victims were rushed to Bellevue Hospital suffering from gunshot wounds to the back and leg. Both are expected to survive.

The incident happened just after 11pm on the skating rink in the heart of the popular midtown park located at 42nd Street and 5th Avenue.

Witnesses of the harrowing incident took to Twitter to share their accounts and photos from the crime scene.

‘People just fell on the floor because they heard a gunshot and they had ice skating skates on so they couldn’t run,’ said Raghuram Krishnamachar, 29, of Brooklyn, who was eating dinner with his girlfriend and her family at the park’s second-floor restaurant Celsius.

‘People were scared they didn’t know what was going on,’ he said.

Krishnamachar said he heard three shots ring out and saw skaters down below scramble for safety, while one person lay motionless on the rink. He posted a photo of the scene on Twitter.

He said restaurant patrons were told to lie on the floor and eventually were ushered to a back room.

‘We didn’t know anything. The shooter could’ve been a lunatic with a machine gun,’ he said.

The suspects in the shooting are reportedly still at large. The New York Daily News said police are on the hunt for a man with dreadlocks and wearing a red hooded sweatshirt.

A witness told the New York Times Saturday night that he saw a man skate up to another person in the middle of the rink, pull a gun and open fire.

In total, three shots reportedly rang out, sending park goers running for cover, some of them wearing only socks.

A young woman believed to be a victim's sister was heard exclaiming, ‘My brother 'just got shot in front of my face.'

Christopher Guerrero, 19, said one of the victims was a friend named Adonis, identified by MailOnline as Adonis Mera.

According to Mr Guerrero, the teenager told him he could not feel his legs as he was lying on the ice.

On his Facebook account, Mera posted a message Friday about his weekend plans: 'Catch me at Bryant Park!!'

Shorty before the shooting, the boy wrote on his page that the park was packed with people.

Early Sunday morning, Mera's numerous friends and well-wishers took to Twitter to post messages of support for the injured young man. 

Arelis Marie wrote: 'The fact that people can't go ice skating without someone tryna catch a body is crazy! Pull through Adonis, we're praying for you.'

NYPD officers 
converged on the park after receiving reports of shots fired and 
quarantined some 50  skaters, who were later released after being 
questioned by police.

Joe
Carella, a spokesman for Bryant Park Corporation, the not-for-profit 
company that privately manages the park, said the park is virtually 
crime free.

In the 1970s, Bryant Park, like much of Midtown Manhattan, had been taken over by drug dealers, prostitutes and homeless people and was considered a no-go zone by law-abiding city dwellers.

The park went through a massive overhaul in the late 80s, emerging as an exemplary urban green space after a 4-year renovation, which was praised by Time Magazine as a ‘small miracle.’

These days, the park is packed with office workers on fair-weather weekdays, tourists and families on the weekends and ice skating enthusiasts during the winter months.

In 2005, Bryant Park introduced Citi Pond - a free ice skating rink that became a fixture in the Manhattan holiday scene. It is open until midnight on the weekends.
