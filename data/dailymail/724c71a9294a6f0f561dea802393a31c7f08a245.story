Host commentator

An awful second half from Real Madrid, who started so positively.

A blow to their La Liga credentials already? Not quite, but this just proves buying attackers doesn't always mean results...

86mins: Slight chance for Sami Khedira but his header goes voer the bar from the corner.

Game. Over.

Real have really thrown this away, and it's a former Arsenal man who finishes them off...surely.

The forward chests the ball down from a corner and fires a volley into the roof of the net.

74mins: Sociedad holding firm. Can't believe this is the same side we saw in the first half!

Can you believe this? What a turnaround!

It's that man David Zurutuza again who gets in front of Pepe to convert a drilled cross from Xabi Prieto.

No chance for Casillas, but what a story this is.

57mins: Real just not playing at the same pace right now. Bale misplaces a cross from the right after a slow break, while James Rodriguez doesn't seem to know his place in this side.

53mins: In contrast to the start of the first half, Sociedad are well on top now. Much more energy, and it does help when the fans aren't getting on your back I'm sure!

48mins: Real Sociedad nearly take the lead! Agirretxe gets up for a free header, with Casillas rushing out, and luckily for the keeper the ball canons off his thigh and out for a corner.

What an entertaining first-half that was! Strange how a game can change on its head so quickly.

The visitors started so well, looking like they'd make double figures before half-time, but two wonderful crosses later and Sociedad are level.

More to come, folks!

Very much game on! What was I thinking writing the hosts off?

David Zurutuza is as brave as can be as he nets his diving header, benefiting from another wonderful cross.

Trouble in paradise for the visitors.

Game on! Not sure Sociedad have deserved this, but I'll take it!

Fantastic corner from the right, Xavi Prieto flicks it on at the near post and Inigo Martinez taps in at the back. Simple.

Still think Madrid have got more goals in them, though...

33mins: Real go close again. Suicidal defending from the hosts, who lose it 30 yards from goal. The boys in pink pounce and Toni Kroos should have done better after being slid through on goal. Decent save from the keeper again, mind.

27mins: Finally a dangerous attack from the hosts, but what a block by Sergio Ramos! Esteban Granero meets a knock down with a fierce volley from 10 yards out but the defender throws his body in the way to get it clear.

He's having an alright game, isn't he?

24mins: Real just look so dangerous going forward. It's Marcelo again who gets the final shot away this time, but it's well saved by Zubikarai. All coming down that left-hand side.

20mins: It nearly gets worse for the hosts. De La Bella plays a poor back pass and goalkeeper Zubikarai gets lucky when jumping up for a header with Benzema. Seconds later Marcelo's effort flies just wide.

17mins: Gareth Bale now joining Benzema up front, making this very much a 4-4-2. James Rodriguez, who has hardly been involved, is now on the left and Isco right.

Can't see the hosts getting into this one somehow, these 'new Galacticos' look brilliant.

11mins: Brilliant, just brilliant from Gareth Bale.

The winger receives the ball into feet, nutmegs the defender, then places his effort into the bottom corner.

This could get nasty.

9mins: Ramos nearly makes it two! This time the centre back (yes, centre back) crashes his free-kick against the post.

Ideal start for the visitors, but a blow for Real Sociedad (and the neutrals!).

Ramos is inexcusably left unmarked at the corner and makes no mistake in powering his header into the bottom corner.

Uphill task for the hosts now.

4mins: Early look at this Real formation, and it's Bale on the left, Isco behind Benzema and James right. Plenty of options should they want to change it though.

Away we go! Real all in pink tonight. Or should I say 'Fuschia'

SIMON JONES: Real Madrid have held further conversations with Manchester United as they press to take Javier Hernandez on loan.

The Mexico striker will leave United on Monday and the Santiago Bernabeu is looking increasingly like his next destination.

Real, who have Karim Benzema as their only recognised centre forward, opened discussions on Saturday with the player being informed of their interest while returning from Saturday's game with Burnley.

Ronaldo rested tonight to avoid further injuries, he'll have three weeks off.

Carlo Ancelotti certainly has other options though. James, Isco and Gareth Bale start behind Karim Benzema, with Luka Modric and Toni Kroos behind them.

Sandro scores to put Barcelona 1-0 up against Villarreal.

What have you got now, Real? Kick-off is 20 minutes away.

Zubikarai, Elustondo, Bergara, Iñigo, Granero, Agirretxe, X.Prieto, Zurutuza, Chory, Zaldua, De la Bella

Casillas, Carvajal, Pepe, Ramos, Marcelo, Kroos, Modric, James, Isco, Bale, Benzema

Barcelona are in action at the moment, drawing 0-0 against Villarreal... but what about Real Madrid?

They kick off at 8pm against Real Sociedad, and team news is now filtering in.
