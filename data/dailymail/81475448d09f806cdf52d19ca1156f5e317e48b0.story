'At peace': Robin Williams, pictured performing at a USO show, who was found dead on Monday and is suspected of having taken his own life in despair

The husband of the woman who found Robin Williams dead has posted a touching tribute to the late comedian on Facebook.

Dan
 Spencer, the novelist husband of Rebecca Erwin Spencer, Williams' 
assistant, wrote movingly about his and his wife's relationship with the
 star.

'Those of us lucky 
enough to be in his sphere saw our hero conquer the world. We joined him
 on journeys across the globe,' wrote Mr Spencer. 'He killed ‘em! He 
slayed ‘em! What great victories! What wondrous experiences!

'We were incredibly fortunate to follow him into the breach.'

But
 the author, who has 12 novels currently in print, also shed light on 
the personal 'war' that drove Williams to apparently commit suicide on 
Monday.

He wrote on his own Facebook fan page: 'As a 
little boy, he was alone in his room with his toy soldiers while his 
parents went off on business trips. You can imagine his mother and 
father telling him to be a good little soldier while they were away. 
Then he would be left alone to play with his friends, which were little 
Army men. When his parents returned, he received a gift, a token for his
 good behavior, maybe more little soldiers to add to his collection.

'Those
 toys remained with him throughout his life and were often given 
prominent space in his home on specially crafted display cases.'

Mr
 Spencer described how Williams' childhood love of military themed toys 
developed into a love of first-person shooter video games. He and his 
wife, he said, referred to Williams' avid gaming as him 'saving the 
world'.

Referring to 
Williams' many appearances entertaining U.S. troops on USO tours, Mr 
Spencer went on: 'Then he went off to dangerous places like Afghanistan 
and Iraq at the height of war to entertain the troops, the soldiers. 
Maybe it was a way to pay back his boyhood friends.'

'But
 his final conflict was heartbreaking to witness,' wrote Mr Spencer. 
'Oh, if you could only have seen the war raging inside him. It would 
have stopped your heart. We fought the fight with him, but it left him 
defeated.

'Now our hero has laid down his arms. He has bid his soldiers farewell. The final fight is over.

'At last, that lonely little boy is at peace.'

The United Service Organization, a non-profit works to lift the spirits of US troops stationed around the world, also paid tribute its own tribute to Williams.

The star famously performed for them in Afghanistan, Iraq and Kuwait over the years. 'The entire USO family is saddened by the news of Robin Williams' passing,' the USO said in a statement.

'One of the great comedic actors of his generation, Williams traveled around the world to lift the spirits of our troops and their families. He will always be a part of our USO family and will be sorely missed.'

USO photographer Dave Gatley, who took these pictures published in MailOnline today, said Williams approached the task of keeping soldiers' spirits up 'tirelessly'.

'He would make sure he reached everyone he could, staying at each site to make sure he shook each hand to the end,' Mr Gatley said.

The tributes to came after theatres on Broadway, New York City, dimmed their lights last night to mark Williams' passing.

Theatregoers, staff and actors across Broadway remembered the star in solemn tribute by dimming their marquees for one minute.

A photo of the actor was also projected on a large screen above the Imperial and Music Box theatres.

The actor was best known for his screen work but had several hit performances on the stage.

Theatergoers reveled in his performance alongside Steve Martin in Waiting for Godot in 1988 and more recently in Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo in 2011.

Williams appeared in a one man show, Robin Williams: Live on Broadway, in 2002.

Those in stage and screen were equally shocked by his suicide on Monday.

The exact nature of his death has become a controversial point in the tragedy as San Francisco Bay area sheriffs spoke out yesterday to defend of their decision to reveal how the actor killed himself.

Marin County Sheriff's Lieutenant Keith Boyd said in an email that the agency would have liked to withhold some of the information, but could not under the California Public Records Act.

'These kinds of cases, whether they garner national attention or not, are very difficult for everyone involved,' Lt. Boyd said.

'Frankly, it would have been our personal preference to withhold a lot of what we disclosed to the press yesterday, but the California Public Records Act does not give us that kind of latitude.'

Boyd announced during a live, televised 
news conference Tuesday that Williams committed suicide by hanging 
himself. He described in detail how Williams carried out the suicide and
 the condition of the body.

Some people criticised the level of detail, 
and experts in suicide prevention said the information could influence 
those considering suicide to try the same thing.

'Having that amount of detail is not helpful' said Lyn Morris, vice president of clinical operations at Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services, which runs the main suicide prevention hotline in Southern California. 'The contagion effect is real, and it's worrisome.'

Lt. Boyd said the sheriff's office is discussing with the county's attorney possible exemptions to the public record's act that would allow it to withhold the 911 call it received from Williams' home and fire dispatch tapes.

But he said the agency would likely have to release them within ten days, as required by law.

Free speech groups defended the disclosures as appropriate and said the law enforcement agency was responding to a crush of a requests for information required to be disclosed.

'Coroners are not required to provide details by press conference,' said Terry Francke, head of open government group Californians Aware. But he said the Marin County Sheriff's Department chose to disseminate as much information as quickly possible at one time rather than leak details piecemeal.

Some three dozen television cameras and twice as many reporters from around the globe crowded the news conference outside the sheriff's offices on Tuesday morning.

'While the impact of the details on some people's mourning of Mr. Williams' passing may have been jarring, keeping what was known under wraps would have added needless speculation if not suspicion to the general shock,' Mr Francke said.
