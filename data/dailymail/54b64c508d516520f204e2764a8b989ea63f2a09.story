British Prime Minister David Cameron arrived for an EU Budget summit at the European Council building in Brussels today, demanding deep cuts in spending

David Cameron arrived in Brussels today for a fresh attempt at cutting the European Union’s vast budget.

The Prime Minister insists he will not accept a deal unless the cost of running Europe falls for the rest of the decade.

He has in his sights the European foreign service, run by British commissioner Baroness Ashton as part of a demand to cut £25billion reduction in the EU’s lavish spending plans.

Mr Cameron was due to hold meetings with Dutch PM Mark Rutte and other allies this afternoon before tonight’s formal negotiations over dinner.

Arriving at the summit building in Brussels, Mr Cameron fire a shot across the bows of other countries who are demanding budgets continue to rise.

The Premier said: ‘The numbers are much too high. They need to come down - and if they don’t come down there won’t be a deal.

‘The European Union should not be immune to the sorts of pressure we have to reduce spending, find efficiencies and spend wisely - what we are all doing.’

Talks collapsed in November when Mr Cameron and other major contributors to the EU kitty rejected a cut from a planned spending package of about one thousand billion euros (£860billion) for 2014-2020 to about £756bn.

Today German chancellor Angela Merkel, who spoke to Mr Cameron last night, admitted that national positions remained ‘far apart’.

And French president Francois Hollande went in saying compromise was needed, but making plain cuts in EU agriculture spending - from which France benefits hugely - were not on his negotiating agenda.

Mr Hollande said: ‘We must not weaken the (EU) economy. I am here for agreement, if a deal is reasonable. Europe must find compromise, but must maintain growth and solidarity.’

Mr Cameron has also warned EU President Herman van Rompuy that he will veto a deal unless major savings are agreed over the next two days.

He is expected to press for a reduction in staffing and spending at the European External Action Service, which is run by Lady Ashton, who is paid £70,000 more than the Prime Minister.

The Labour peer originally pledged the foreign service would be ‘budget neutral’ but has presided over a five per cent rise in spending during the last year.

Mr Cameron will also seek to slash the number of Brussels civil servants and cut back their pay and perks.

But British officials privately admit that even if Mr Cameron gets his way, Britain’s contributions to the EU budget are likely to rise because of the continuing fallout from Tony Blair’s decision in 2005 to surrender a huge chunk of the EU’s annual rebate.

British sources last night acknowledged it would be ‘tough’ to get a deal, but said the Prime Minister believed there was scope for Mr van Rompuy’s latest proposals to be slashed by ‘tens of billions’.

William Hague yesterday denied that Britain was facing a ‘wall of hostility’ in Brussels following David Cameron’s pledge last month to hold an in/out referendum after the next election.

The Foreign Secretary told MPs that he ‘didn’t detect any change in our ability to get our own way or any difficulties’ in his latest negotiations with European counterparts.

He said Britain would accept the 
result of the referendum ‘whatever the consequences’ - but conceded 
civil servants were not making preparations for a possible withdrawal.

Britain will hold the rotating EU 
presidency in the second half of 2017 and Mr Hague said he could not 
rule out holding the referendum during it, as the timing depended on the
progress of repatriating powers. He said it would ‘certainly make for a
particularly memorable presidency’.

The situation is complicated by a series of competing demands from virtually all of the 27 countries involved.

Germany,
Sweden, Austria and the Netherlands are looking to have their existing 
budget rebates extended for another seven years, while Denmark has 
warned it will veto a deal unless it is granted a rebate for the first 
time.

Mr Cameron told reporters that the EU's budget deal was 'too high' and must be cut before he would agree to a deal

Before arriving in Brussels, Mr Cameron made a series of calls to EU allies who are also demanding a reduction in spending

France is looking to protect farm subsidies, while Italy’s Mario Monti, who is in the midst of a general election campaign, is seeking to ringfence spending on infrastructure.

Any deal will also have to be signed off by the European parliament which has demanded an astonishing £910 billion budget.

Mats Persson, director of the think tank Open Europe said it was vital the budget was reformed, as well as cut, to focus spending on areas more likely to boost Europe’s flagging economy.

He said: ‘We see a 35 per cent probability of a deal this week. If Italy and France keep on insisting on more cash to achieve short-term political gains, the talks will fail.’

If no deal is done by the end of the year then the current EU budget will be automatically rolled over into 2014 and increased by two per cent to allow for inflation.
