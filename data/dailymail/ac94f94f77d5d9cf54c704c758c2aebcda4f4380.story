Short supply: Hospital bosses have been forced abroad in their hunt for staff (file photo)

One in three hospitals is bringing in nurses from abroad because wards are so understaffed, an investigation has found.

NHS managers are travelling to countries including Poland, Greece, Spain, Portugal, India and the Philippines in the drive to recruit nurses.

But concerns have been raised over the English-speaking abilities of some foreign staff, while others may lack training and experience.

And MPs and campaigners say it is absurd some hospitals are making nurses redundant or have imposed recruitment freezes while others are desperately having to poach them from abroad.

Separate figures from the Nursing and Midwifery Council show the number of foreign nurses coming to work in Britain has doubled in just three years, up from 2,306 to 4,521.

This means nearly a fifth of the 25,500 new nurses registering each year are from abroad.

An investigation by Nursing Times using Freedom of Information requests found that 40 out of 105 hospital trusts have actively recruited nurses from abroad within the past 12 months.

In total they had poached some 1,360 nurses from abroad.

But over the past few years concerns have been raised over the poor language and medical skills of nurses – and doctors – working for the NHS, with some patients claiming they have had to use sign language.

Some of Britain’s foremost doctors have expressed their own frustration – including Lord Winston, a fertility specialist, who warned that nurses from Eastern Europe have been ‘trained in a completely different way’.

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association said: ‘In all of the caring services, good communications is vitally important for a number of reasons.

‘If language issues prevent this level of communication then clearly patient care will suffer and safety is compromised.’

The NMC’s figures also show three quarters of the foreign nurses that registered to work in Britain last year were from European countries and therefore did not face language or skills checks.

EU rules prohibit such tests being carried out on nurses from member states as they are deemed a threat to ‘freedom of labour’.

Only last month research by Kings College London found more than 40 per cent of hospital wards did not have enough nurses to run safely.

And this summer an investigation into hospitals with the highest death rates by the NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh found evidence of widespread nursing shortages.

Although the numbers of nurses working in the NHS increased by more than a fifth under Labour, over the past three years they have begun falling again.

Figures show there are now 5,000 fewer posts compared to April 2010 and some trusts have been making staff redundant.

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Recruiting from abroad is nothing new. Overseas nurses make a very valuable contribution to NHS patient care.

'However, they should only ever work in the NHS if they have proven their competence and language skills.’
