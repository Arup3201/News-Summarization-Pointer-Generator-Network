The French Prime Minister has reshuffled his cabinet to silence critics of socialist President Francois Hollande's economic policies.  

Emmanuel Macron, who previously served as a top economic advisor, now heads the Economy Ministry, replacing Arnaud Montebourg, who railed against 'unjust' government policies.

Macron, a 36-year-old former banker who advised Hollande until June 2014, is known for his pro-business stance.

Emmanuel Macron, 36, a former banker known for his pro-business stance, has replaced Arnaud Montebourg as head of the Economic Ministry in a move designed to silence critics of President Hollande

His appointment by Prime Minister Manuel Valls will send a strong message to the EU that France is serious about getting its finances in order after years of stagnation.

Education Minister Benoit Hamon and Culture Minister Aurelie Filippetti, who supported Montebourg in attacking the government, also lost their jobs.

Hamon was replaced by Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, the former sports and youth minister, and Filippetti was replaced by Fleur Pellerin, former minster for commerce and tourism.

Yet, Finance Minister Michel Sapin, Foreign Affairs Minister Laurent Fabius and Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian stayed in place in the limited reshuffle.

The reshuffle comes less than five months after Mr Valls took office, promoting Hollande's agenda. 

The changes are aimed at creating a Cabinet that embodies Hollande's policies, seen as too far to the right by some Socialists.

In addition to the ousted ministers, dozens of other Socialists are believed to consider Hollande's economic policies a betrayal of the party's cause.

Mr Valls on Tuesday said any debate 'should be held within the government.'

'There is a single (policy) line and members of the government cannot make a spectacle,' Valls said in a TV interview on France-2 TV.

'I have a single mission ... to set the country aright,' he added.

The French president asked all the ministers to swear their loyalty to the government line or to leave the Cabinet, a top government official said. 

France, the second largest economy in the eurozone, has had no growth this year.

Hollande is the most unpopular president in recent French history, with ratings below 20 percent. 

He has promised to lower the country's 10 percent jobless rate, cut the deficit, and rekindle growth as well as cutting 50 billion euros ($29 billion) in state spending by 2017.
