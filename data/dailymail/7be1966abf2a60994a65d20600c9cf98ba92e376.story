A mother-of-two taken hostage by a war veteran who shot his way inside her Oklahoma law office has spoken out, saying she sympathizes with the gunman.

Paralegal Jennifer Shokat hid under her desk terrified when she heard gunshots as Deven Rogers entered her Norman offices during the four-hour stand-off on Monday.

But Ms Shokat said from the outset Rogers, 29, was polite and reassuring. And she even feels sorry for him.

Jennifer Shokat said gunman Deven Rogers was polite and reassuring during the four-hour hostage drama at her workplace in Norman, Oklahoma, on Monday and that she feels sorry for him

Rogers told Ms Shokat that he was an army veteran who had served in both Iraq and Afghanistan 

He had told her he was a veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and had chosen her office at random, having seen cars in the parking lot.

Ms Shokat told ABC News: 'He had no more value to society. He had come back and could not find any work that would pay above minimum wage, and he said that he just wanted to go to jail, but he wanted to negotiate terms.'

'I think he needs to get the help he needs. I do not feel like, you know, he was a psychopath. I feel like he was a person who had just snapped.' 

Recalling the ordeal, Ms Shokat said Rogers saw her dive under her desk, and asked her to stand up, saying 'I'm not going to hurt you'.

Ms Shokat started crying, worried that her life was in danger, but Shokat kept his word. While he held her captive for four hours, long after he released dozens of others, he did not harm her.

He was also considerate, asking her for permission to smoke a cigarette.

As the drama unfolded, Ms Shokat, 32, texted her family and friends and also interacted with her husband and co-workers. 

She also kept Rogers talking. They spoke about war and politics, but she backed off when he became agitated. 

Ms Shokat said: 'I think survival instinct kicks in,' Shokat said. 'I was just winging it, basically.'

Shokat said Rogers negotiated his surrender using a phone provided by the police. With her assistance, he signed an agreement which allowed her to leave.

Rogers was then taken into custody and will be charged in district court today.
