A prisoner jailed for more than nine years for his part in a massive fraud operation is using his day release to embark on an affair with a married mother-of-three.

Convicted forger Phillip Brown, 48, has been seen at the home of Elisha Neal, who he met at a party last Christmas and began seeing each other shortly afterwards. 

Brown was jailed in 2011 for his role in a gang of forgers who faked £17.5million of banknotes.

He is let out of Standford Hill Open Prison in Kent, where Ms Neal lives nearby, to work as a builder as part of his rehabilitation.

But he uses the time to meet up with his 34-year-old lover. It has been alleged he is able to do so because his boss is a friend and he is under minimal supervision by prison officials.

A source told The Sun: 'What sort of prison sentence is that?

'Phil's supposed to be working but his boss is his mate so he sneaks off to meet Elisha and goes back to prison in the evening.'

Ms Neal's husband reportedly moved out of their home in January has filed for divorce. He described the pair as 'wrong 'uns'.

Pictures posted on her Facebook account show the couple embracing. It has since been deleted.
