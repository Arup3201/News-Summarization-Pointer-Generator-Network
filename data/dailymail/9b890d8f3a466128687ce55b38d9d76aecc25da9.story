A former Maxim cover girl who also appeared in Esquire now has a mugshot to add to her portfolio.

Ralitsa Ivanoca, 29, was arrested and charged with driving under the influence after her vehicle was seen weaving back and forth and driving in the wrong lane while heading north on US 41 in Florida.

When she was pulled over, the two-time Bulgarian Maxim cover model said she trying to drive south from Tampa to St. Petersburg, according to a Pasco County Sheriff's Office statement.

Ivanoca told police she was going south to St. Petersburg but was really going north towards Land O'Lakes

Other drivers had called police and reported seeing Ivanova's black BMV traveling in the wrong direction. 

A deputy stopped Invanoca around 3.45am on Wednesday.

When Invanoca pulled over, the deputy smelled 'a very strong odor of an alcoholic beverage' on her and noticed she had 'watery' and 'bloodshot' eyes, WFTS reported.  

She informed the deputy she was a model and also showed off a text message on her phone from someone advising her not to take a breathalyzer or a field sobriety test.

After initially agreeing to take a sobriety test, Invanoca 'performed very poorly' and was arrested for DUI, WTSP reported. 

She was released from the Land O’ Lakes Jail around 1pm on Wednesday.

The DUI arrest didn't stop Ivanova from going on Twitter and asking her followers to check out her Instagram

Ivanova, who also goes by Rail, was named as Bulgaria's representative in Esquire's 'Sexiest Woman Alive Atlas.'

According to her entry, Ivanova is 'rumored to be inspiration for the word bodacious.'

Ivanova moved to the US at the age of 19 and 'owes her exotic looks to Bulgarian, Russian and Italian ancestry', according to the bio on her website. 

'She remembers that it took her a while to get used to the American environment, but today she loves her glamour life in the beautiful city of Tampa. 

'While having cocktails with friends on the beach, a photographer noticed her and offered her to shoot for a local calendar. 

'She gave it a try and that’s how her professional modelling career started.'

The model is now 'working on building and expanding her own brand'.
