Iraqi forces have recaptured the city  of Baiji in a significant victory over ISIS after more than two weeks of fighting.

Baiji is the largest city to be retaken by government troops since ISIS-led militants overran much of Iraq's Sunni Arab heartland in June in their bid to create an Islamic 'caliphate'.

The recapture  is also strategically important as Iraq's largest oil refinery, capable of producing 300,000 barrels of refined petroleum products per day, is located just outside of the city.

Baiji  is located 130 miles north of Baghdad on the main highway Mosul, and had been under ISIS control since June.

Although ISIS still controls the oil refinery, the recapture of Baiji further isolates militants farther south in the city of Tikrit, although IS still controls large parts of Iraq as well as swathes of Syria.

'Iraqi forces were able to regain complete control of the town of Baiji,' Ahmed al-Krayim, the head of the Salaheddin provincial council said.

'Soldiers, police, Shiite militiamen and tribesmen were all involved in the operation to retake Baiji, and are now pushing farther north.'

'Iraqi forces are on their way to the Baiji refinery where security forces have held out against repeated jihadist attacks'.

Breaking through to the massive refinery would be another significant win for the government in Baghdad. 

But the victory was marred by a suicide bombing Friday that targeted a military command headquarters set up at Tikrit University, south of Baiji, killing at least four people, army officers said.

Three suicide bombers and other militants had attacked the same headquarters in late October, disrupting the initial push into Baiji. 

ISIS also claimed a truck bombing in Baiji that killed a senior police officer last week.

Iraqi troops initially struggled to regain ground from IS after the start of the jihadist offensive.

With help from US-led air strikes, support from Shiite militias and Sunni tribesmen, assistance from international advisers, and a signficant reshuffling of top officers, Baghdad's forces have begun to make progress.

The operation to retake Baiji began more than four weeks ago when security forces and pro-government fighters started advancing towards the town from the south, slowed by bombs militants had planted on the way, and finally entered on October 31.

The nearby Baiji refinery once produced some 300,000 barrels of refined petroleum products per day, meeting 50 per cent of the country's needs, but even once it is recaptured, it would take time before it could resume production.
