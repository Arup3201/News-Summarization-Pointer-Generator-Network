A harrowing 911 call of a dying women gasping for breath after her husband allegedly poisoned her was played out to a jurors today.  

Husband Dr. Robert Ferrante, 66, allegedly killed his wife by mixing cyanide with an energy drink called creatine, which he told her would help them to conceive another child.

Autumn Marie Klein, 41, collapsed at her Oakland, Pennsylvania home and died on April 20 at UPMC Presbyterian, where she also headed the women's neurology department.

The jury heard the frantic - and at times ghastly - 911 call from the first witness, an emergency dispatcher. 

Ferrante is heard saying his wife has collapsed in the kitchen and jurors could hear him begging for help and horrific groaning noises from Klein in the background.

'She just got home from work.'

'Her whole face is flaccid.' 

'Please, please, please, please. She's not saying a word. Please, sweetheart! No!.' 

'She's having so much difficulty breathing. Oh, God.' 

'Oh, Autumn, please, please sweetheart!. Please.' 

'She just got home from work,' Mr. Ferrante told the dispatcher. 'Her whole face is flaccid.'

Following the calltaker's instructions, he asked Klein to raise her arms above her head.

'Please, please, please, please. She's not saying a word. Please, sweetheart! No!.'

Later, he continues, 'She's having so much difficulty breathing. Oh, God.

'Oh, Autumn, please, please sweetheart!. Please.'  

The couple have a six-year-old daughter called Cianna. 

Today assistant district attorney Lisa Pellegrini told the jury that Ferrante attempted to obscure his wife's death, by insisting she shouldn't have an autopsy, reports Pittsburgh Post Gazette.

Despite those instructions, an autopsy was performed, revealing a lethal amount of cyanide in her system.

'All along, the evidence will show you, this defendant thinks he's smarter than everyone else,' Ms. Pellegrini said. 

He was 'one blood test and one phone call ... away from getting away with the perfect murder.'

According to a criminal complaint obtained by ABC News, after Ferrante gave her the drink, Klein wrote, 'Will it stimulate egg production too?'

Ferrante allegedly responded with a smiley face.

ABC News also reported that hours after a police interview following Klein's death, Ferrante allegedly performed a Google search, writing, 'Would ECMO or dialysis remove traces of toxins poisons?'

But defense attorney William Difenderfer told the jurors the ALS expert did not poison his wife.

He also said medical experts will show she wasn't poisoned by anyone and died of unexplained causes.

'Myself and Dr. Ferrante do not accept, and will never accept, that Autumn Klein died from orally ingesting hydrogen cyanide.'  

Prosecutors want a first-degree murder conviction, punishable by life in prison.
