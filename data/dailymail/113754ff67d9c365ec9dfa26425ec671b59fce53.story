The world's only surviving original Creme Egg has been unearthed and gone on display for the first time - although experts admit they don't know what it tastes like.

Chocolate company Fry's launched the Creme Egg in 1963 before it was later rebranded by Cadbury when it took over the company in 1971.

But the only surviving original example of the original Creme Egg has now been found in the archive of American food giant Kraft-owned Cadbury.

Researchers unearthed the egg so it could be displayed in an exhibition called Chocolate! at the M Shed museum in Bristol.

The egg has not been unwrapped since rolling off the production line 50 years ago.

Graham Tratt, archivist at Bristol Records Office, spent six months researching chocolate for the exhibition.

He said: 'This is the original, it is how the Cadbury Creme Egg started. We don't know what it tastes like because we don't want to unwrap it and spoil it.

A second Fry's egg, dating from between 1963 and 1971 was found in the same container as the fully wrapped one. Right, Margaret Thatcher tours a Cadbury chocolate factory in 1979

'The Fry's eggs were launched in 1963 and rebranded as Cadbury's in 1971. The Cadbury's egg was very similar, although possibly a little bigger than the original.'

Chocolate eggs filled with cream were first manufactured by the Cadbury Brothers in 1923 but the Creme Egg in its current form was not introduced until 1963.

Containing white and yellow fondant filling, the eggs are only available during the Creme Egg season between January and April.

Modern Creme Eggs are now the best-selling confectionery item between New Year's Day and Easter in the UK, with annual sales in excess of 200million.

However, recent sales figures have shown that the nation is falling out of love with the chocolate Easter egg.

In 1919, Cadbury merged with J.S. Fry & Sons Limited so that both companies could compete against Rowntree

The number of shell eggs sold last Easter fell by some 4.15 million -  5.5 per cent – as part of a trend that is expected to continue this year.

It is a sad decline for a tradition that dates back to the production of the first solid dark chocolate Easter eggs by JS Fry's of Bristol in 1879.

Chocolate! displays a history of chocolate and the part Bristol played in it and runs at M Shed until May 6.

There are 15 different brands of chocolate on show, including a tin sent out by Queen Victoria to a soldier during The Boer War.

Cocoa, not alcohol: Cadbury family values

The Cadbury family were one of the driving forces of philanthropy in the late stages of the Victorian era, when society grew more reflective on what had been an age of growing social and economic division.

The industrial revolution had driven prosperity and attracted millions of people to the cities in search of work. Yet millions of those workers lived in abject poverty as characterised in the works of Charles Dickens and other authors.

As Quakers, the Cadbury family 
believed tea, coffee and cocoa beverages could serve as an alternative 
to alcohol, seen to be a cause of poverty and deprivation among the 
working classes.

The Bournville factory was built in 1879 and, in 1893, as part of the company's altruistic vision, saw the creation of a 120-acre village of better housing for its workers.

The Cadbury family was particularly concerned with the health of its workforce, incorporating park and recreation areas into the Bournville village plans, and encouraging swimming, walking and other sports.

In the 20th Century, Cadbury brands seeped into the public consciousness thanks to products such as Dairy Milk bars (1905), Milk Tray (1915), Bassett's Jelly Babies (1918), Flake (1920), Creme Egg (1923), Crunchie (1929), Cadbury Roses (1938), Picnic (1958) and Wispa (1983 - relaunched in 2008 due to demand from an online campaign).
