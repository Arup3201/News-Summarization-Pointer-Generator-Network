The Shack was a surprise self-published hit in 2008

The police find her bloodied clothes in an abandoned shack, but not her body.

Years later the man receives a note telling him to revisit the shack. 

It is signed by 'Papa', his wife's nickname for God. 

The Shack was a surprise self-published hit in 2008, largely thanks to word of mouth, as well as promotion in churches and on Christian radio.

The book, by William P. Young, has sold more than 18 million copies worldwide and has been translated into 39 different languages, according to Variety. 

It was also on the top of the New York Times' Bestseller list for more than 170 weeks. 

Spencer has been splitting her time between movies and television, most recently appearing on the recently cancelled FOX series Red Band Society, as well as the James Brown biopic Get On Up and Black And White with Kevin Costner. 

The Academy award-winning actress can next be seen in the Divergent sequel, Insurgent. 

The Shack is being directed by Stuart Hazeldine.
