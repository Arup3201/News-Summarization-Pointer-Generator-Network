The married British diplomat accused of conducting a sordid prison affair with a convicted drug dealer has broken her silence about the scandal, telling friends it was ‘a huge error of judgment’ on her part.

But despite confessing her naivety in forming a friendship with the man known as Bali’s ‘Mr Big’, Alys Harahap also feels the Foreign Office has ‘thrown her to the wolves’.

Harahap, a mother of two, was suspended by officials last month after she befriended Julian Ponder, the British-born ringleader of a drug-smuggling syndicate, who claimed that he and the Cambridge graduate were in love.

She denies their relationship was intimate, branding Ponder’s claims of secret prison trysts as ‘malicious, nasty and ridiculous’. 

Alys Harahap has told friends she did not have an affair with convicted drug dealer Julian Ponder when she visited the Bali prison where he was being held on behalf of the British Consul

As vice-consul, Harahap met Ponder, 44, when he and three accomplices – including British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford – were jailed at the island’s Kerobokan prison.

Yesterday family friends of Harahap, who is described as ‘a brilliant academic but hardly street-wise’ insisted: ‘Ponder was depressed and Alys worried he might harm himself. She responded by empathising with him. She felt sorry for him and tried to reassure him that she too had felt the same at times in her life. But she never hugged him or made any sort of physical contact.

‘Now she realises in her effort to try to help him she was terribly naive. She exchanged far too much personal information with Ponder.’

Friends insist Harahap is now living in fear of her life and has become so stressed that she has twice been admitted to hospital. One friend even questioned why she was ever allowed to visit antiques restorer Ponder unaccompanied.

‘Alys had no previous experience in consular work, no proper training and no support or guidance,’ he said. ‘To allow Alys to visit these prisoners on her own was absurd. We all believe the Foreign Office showed an extraordinary lack of care and welfare for her. Its actions put Alys’s safety at risk.

‘Alys was – and still is – forbidden by them to speak out and yet her silence has been wrongly misconstrued as guilt. Meanwhile, Ponder has continued to harass her. Presumably the Foreign Office has to investigate any allegations made against a diplomat. But in not robustly defending her as it should have done, it has simply thrown her to the wolves.’

Allegations that Alys is ready to leave her Indonesian husband to be with Ponder are nonsense, said the source. ‘Alys is a happily married young woman with two children. There is no way she would have even entertained an affair with a convicted criminal.’

The revelations are the latest twist in the story of ‘death-row grandmother’ Lindsay Sandiford, 58, who was sentenced in 2013 and whose execution by firing squad is believed to be imminent. 

The former legal secretary from Cheltenham was caught smuggling cocaine worth £1.5 million from Thailand to Bali in 2012. She claims she was forced to act as a drugs mule by a syndicate who threatened the lives of her sons in England. 

The other gang members convicted include Paul Beales, 41, and Ponder’s partner Rachel Dougall, 41 – sentenced to four years and one year respectively. Ponder was sentenced to six years.

Harahap took up her position as vice-consul in Bali in February 2014. Part of her role involved visiting and helping British people in jail over there, although, according to the source, Sandiford didn’t want any help and always refused to see Harahap or anyone else from the British Consul.

The Foreign Office first investigated Harahap’s relationship with Ponder last March after the prison complained to the British Consulate that she had been caught kissing and embracing Ponder on a visit.

‘It was not appropriate for them to act like that,’ the prison governor told The Jakarta Post. Harahap, who was questioned in London, denied any wrongdoing and remained in her job. 

She was suspended only last month when the Foreign Office became aware of tape recordings said to reveal intimate conversations between the two.

Last week, however, friends of Harahap continued to deny there was even so much as an embrace between the pair. The friend took up her side of the story: ‘In March Alys accompanied Ponder to a local hospital for a routine check up. 

'He is a convicted criminal, a drugs lord, and yet she was put in the vulnerable position of expecting to take him to hospital by herself.’

It was during this visit, claims the friend, that Ponder began threatening Harahap.

‘This is a job primarily where she was to offer support and she wanted to help people who found themselves in prison in a foreign country,’ said the source. ‘And wanting to help, she chatted to Ponder.

‘Whether or not he became infatuated with Alys, we don’t know. But he began calling her every day.

‘He constantly messaged her, saying she was duty-bound to visit a prisoner if requested.

‘When she said she was too busy, he became extremely upset. Certainly she realised how naive she’d been when Ponder told her he’d recorded conversations they had shared and was planning to sell them to the press, as taken out of context these could have given the wrong impression.

'He also said he knew of people who could impersonate her voice on the phone and would doctor recordings.

‘She realises she should have told her superiors but, then again, this was a new job and she was anxious not to give the wrong impression.

‘She was terrified. Ponder said he knew where she lived. She was beside herself with worry for the welfare of her children and husband if she did not agree to his demands.’ Fearful, Harahap asked for extra security at her home but was told she’d have to fund it herself.

Friends said Harahap felt let down by the Foreign Office who she felt should not have allowed her to visit Ponder alone 

The friend further alleges: ‘Over the next few weeks three mobiles belonging to Alys were stolen along with her bank cards. She now wonders if Ponder was behind this.

‘Certainly Ponder became obsessed with Alys, and wanted her to visit him every day in prison. If she didn’t visit, he would fly into a terrifying rage. She refused. But she simply didn't have the nous to be able to cope.

‘While her husband and close friends knew the affair allegation was rubbish, Alys was devastated,’ said the friend.

‘By now even Ponder had confirmed in writing to her superiors that they’d never had a romantic or physical relationship and she’d cut off all contact with him.

‘Alys has never ever said anything of an explicit or sexual nature to Ponder. Bizarrely he even sends her texts now – which she never responds to – apologising for his lies. He just seems to be totally obsessed with her.

‘Before this nightmare Alys had a promising career with the Foreign Office. She has won a consular excellence award and has been praised for her high standards, support and guidance. Yet in her bid to do the job to the best of her ability she has made errors of judgment.

‘But so have others with far more experience, and yet she finds herself being the only one singled out, the person who is being blamed.’
