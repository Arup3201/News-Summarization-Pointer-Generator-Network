Shy: Kirsten Farage said she has to stay at home and look after their children because husband Nigel’s job running Ukip means she is effectively a single mother

Her husband is never shy of a photo opportunity and revels in the limelight. 

But Kirsten Farage is keen to shun the ‘sad’ role of a traditional party leader’s wife.

The 48-year-old, who is seldom seen in public, said she has to stay at home and look after their children because husband Nigel’s job running Ukip means she is effectively a single mother.

As she made a rare appearance at the party’s spring conference in Kent yesterday, German-born Mrs Farage said she keeps a deliberately low profile.

Asked if she would be joining her husband on stage to embrace and kiss him after his speech, she replied: ‘No. Definitely not. That’s really quite sad.’

Party sources say Mrs Farage is ‘brilliantly intelligent’ and a key figure behind the scenes, but she insists she will not be playing a more high-profile role during the General Election campaign.

‘I work from home and Nigel is never there, so I am a single mother in many ways,’ the mother-of-two joked.

‘Someone has to be there and take the children to school.’ 

In a clue to their domestic arrangements, Mrs Farage revealed that her husband did not even know where basic household equipment was kept.

‘He just called me and asked where do we keep the ironing board as he needed to iron his shirt,’ she said. 

‘I’m not that surprised. It is a bit worrying.’

Mrs Farage said that she finds public interest in her ‘mad’, but added that people only recognise her when they read her name badge at events.

She said: ‘There are a lot more interesting people than me.’

Mr Farage met his second wife in Frankfurt in 1996, while he was on business shortly after his divorce from his first wife Grainne, the mother of his two grown-up sons.

‘She was a stunning government bond broker whose brisk efficiency at first sight belied her ethereal appearance,’ he has said. ‘She could have stepped into a pre-Raphaelite painting, no questions asked.’

Mr Farage married Kirsten in 1999. They have two daughters aged nine and 14.

Asked about the contradiction of having a German wife while railing against immigration, Mr Farage has previously deflected the question by joking that their marriage is proof he loves Europe.

His gruelling schedule as party leader means that he gets up at 5am and works seven days a week, travelling on average eight hours a day to speak at meetings across the country.

Mr Farage has previously admitted that he has not spent enough time with his children.

He said: ‘In an ideal world children benefit from having some sense of stability with preferably two parents and not one.

‘And that really, for more than the last decade, has not been the case with me.

‘Men tend to be more single-minded and selfish in terms of the choices they make and the effect it has on their families.’

Mrs Farage’s stance contrasts with that of David Cameron’s wife Samantha and Ed Miliband’s wife Justine Thornton, who traditionally appear on stage at party conferences.

After Mr Miliband’s speech last year, there was an embarrassing mishap as he moved in to kiss Miss Thornton – but missed.

Nick Clegg’s wife Miriam has repeatedly shown her independent spirit at Liberal Democrat conferences. 

Rather than going up to the podium to fawn over her husband, she waits for him to come off stage to join her.
