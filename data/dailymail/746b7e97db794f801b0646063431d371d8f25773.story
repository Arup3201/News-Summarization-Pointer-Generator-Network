After a huge slump in ratings, Simon Cowell was desperate to re-sign Dannii Minogue as an X Factor judge.

But the Australian beauty has snubbed her former fling and signed up to join the judging panel on fashion show Britain & Ireland's Next Top Model instead.

The star is no stranger to being in the judges seat and already runs her own successful fashion line Project D, so is sure to fit right in alongside Elle MacPherson and actor Tyson Beckford on the panel.

Signed up: Dannii Minogue has signed as a judge on Britain and Ireland's Next Top Model alongside Elle Macpherson

The 41-year-old has reportedly signed a six-figure deal with Sky Living, which is sure to leave Simon Cowell seething.

Dannii, who will begin work in February, said: 'I am brushing up on my model moves and with my highest platform heels on, I am excited to come face to face with (well maybe look up to) the glamazons of BINTM 2013.

'Next Top Model has always been a part of my essential TV viewing and I am so excited to be back in the UK for Britain & Ireland’s Next Top Model’s ninth series.' she told The Mirror.

'Mentoring and judging has been a major part of my life since 2007. It will be great to strut some fashion and modeling experience with the girls.

Not happy: Simon Cowell isn't likely to be happy that Dannii snubbed his offer to judge X Factor

'I remember Elle’s first magazine cover in Australia and I have been a fan of hers since then.

'I am looking forward to joining Elle, Tyson and the contestants to find the next biggest star.

'It’s an exciting time to be part of the Sky Living team. Bring on 2013.”

Elle Macpherson said: 'I am so pleased to once again be Executive Producing and hosting Britain and Ireland's Next Top Model, which has become a jewel in Sky Living’s summer schedule.

Fashion label: Dannii is well versed in fashion and her line Project D is loved by the Middleton sisters

'I am really enthusiastic about working with Dannii. I have watched her blossom into a powerhouse in fashion and television and believe she will bring a fresh energy to the show – plus she’s gorgeous.'

Julien Macdonald and Whitney Port will not return for the ninth cycle of Britain & Ireland's Next Top Model with the controversial Macdonald reportedly wanting to focus on his fashion label.

Britain and Ireland's Next Top Model will begin on Sky Living in the Summer 2013.
