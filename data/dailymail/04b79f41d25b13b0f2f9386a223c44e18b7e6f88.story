Millions of dollars in heroin labeled ‘NFL’ was recovered and two people were arrested this week when authorities busted a dope ring only miles from the site of this Sunday's Super Bowl.

Federal, state and city agencies converged on the Bronx ‘heroin mill’ Thursday night and found 33 pounds of dope with a street value of $8million and hundreds of thousands of baggies stamped with various brand names including the NFL monicker.

Scales, 18 coffee grinders, baking soda, face masks and rubber bands from the apartment just a short drive from MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, the DEA announced.

Not league approved: This NFL stamp was used to brand millions of dollars worth of heroin flowing from a Bronx apartment building

Stacks: Bundles of tiny baggies called 'decks' filled garbage bags hauled out of the fifth-floor apartment

Law enforcement had been surveilling the location for some time and moved in after seeing Cristino Then, 25, delivering a package to the building. Both he and Augustin Rivera, who was caught trying to flee down the fire escape, were arrested and face multiple drug distribution charges.

‘Agents and officers seized approximately 13 kilograms of heroin (33 pounds) and hundreds of thousands of individual ‘glassine’ bags stamped with numerous brand names, including ‘NFL,’ ‘government shutdown,’ ‘iPhone,’ and ‘Olympics 2012,’ an agency statement said.

‘The brand names used are tied to upcoming events, indicating the savvy and sophistication of the heroin distribution ring,’ special narcotics prosecutor Bridget Brennan added.

'Heroin mill': Authorities referred to the location as a heroin mill while announcing the massive bust

Brand names: NFL was one of many brand names stamped onto the heroin distributed from the location, other names found in the bag of stamps pictured here included 'iPhone,' 'income tax' and 'McDonalds'

Sophisticated: Authorities say the use of relevant brand names shows the sophistication of the drug ring

The agency further explained that ‘coffee grinders are often used to cut pure heroin with a dilutant, such as baking soda.’

Each of the two men arrested faces felony charges of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree.

The bust was made as heroin addiction rates across the country are soaring and an epidemic of killer dope has been ravaging the Northeast since the beginning of the year.

‘A seizure of this size should open everyone’s eyes to the magnitude of the heroin problem confronting us,’ said Ms Brennan.

Large scale: Authorities also said they believe the apartment was the center of a regional distribution chain feeding into the alarming growth of heroin use throughout the Northeast

Uncut: Pure yellow heroin can be seen sitting in a separate bag on top of baking soda, which is used to what drug dealers call 'cut' the product in order to maximize profits

Ready to go: Cases of already packaged heroin - bagged, stamped and neatly packed - filled this oven in the apartment

This latest bust does not appear tied to the fentanyl-laced heroin blamed for at least 100 deaths in the past few months from New Hampshire to Washington State and down to Louisiana.

Those batches of heroin have been labeled 'bud ice,' 'income tax' and 'theraflu.'

This past week, in nearby Nassau County, on Long Island, authorities linked multiple deaths to the heroin-fentanyl blend. The drugs used by to those victims were branded ‘24K,’ authorities said.
