Tourists on a big wheel ride in Budapest were left befuddled when the commentary described the city of Plymouth over a thousand miles away.

While gazing down at the banks of the River Danube, passengers heard a voice inside their pod waxing lyrical about the beauty and history of Smeaton's Tower, the Mayflower steps, the Devonport Naval Base and Sir Francis Drake.

But there's a simple explanation: The big wheel completed its final rotation on Plymouth Hoe almost a year ago -  and is now entertaining visitors 1300 miles away in the centre of the Hungarian capital.

Confused: Tourists on the wheel heard commentary describing a city over a thousand miles away

The commentary promised 'a bird's eye view of Plymouth' as it was heading up and over the River Danube

The commentary, by Radio Plymouth's Tim Mans and Jon White and city historian Chris Robinson, promised riders 'a bird's eye view of Plymouth', before explaining what they should be looking at asthey went around. 

The company which runs the wheel admitted to the mix-up, but says it has since been rectified.

Merv Metcalf, aged 42, from London, visited Budapest in June with his friend Alexan Palamountain.

'We had some time to kill before flying back so we went on the wheel,' Merv said.

'There were four of us in our pod, you can put the commentary on or off so we put it on, expecting to hear about the sights and sounds of Budapest.

'But instead we had a welcome from a couple of DJs telling us about the sights and sounds of Plymouth and its history.

'There was no alternative, so someone must have forgotten to swap the commentaries over. It was quite a surreal, strange experience.'

Plymothian Steve Dykes, who visited the city in July, added: 'They have forgotten to change the tape, so if you select 'English' when the wheel moves it spouts all about Plymouth's history and views of the Hoe.'

Historian Chris Robinson, whose voice could be heard on the commentary, said the revelation was news to him.

'It must have been somewhat bizarre, especially if anyone listening to it spoke English,' he said. 

The 214-ft-wheel is now in Erzsebet Square in the centre of Hungary' beautiful capital, Budapest

The wheel opened in Plymouth in 2011 and was taken over in September 2012 by Dubai-based Freij World Attractions.

The 214-ft-high attraction is now in Erzsebet Square in the centre of Budapest, forming the centrepiece of the Sziget Festival.

Tamas Kadar, CEO of Sziget Cultural Management, said the Plymouth commentary was mistakenly added to the wheel when it opened in Budapest in May and has since been turned off.
