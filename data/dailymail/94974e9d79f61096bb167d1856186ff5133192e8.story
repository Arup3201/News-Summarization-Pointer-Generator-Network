Brock Allen Turner, 19, is accused of raping an unconscious woman near fraternity housing

A teenage former Stanford swim star and U.S. Olympic triallist is to be charged with raping a woman while she lay unconscious in the university grounds.

Brock Allen Turner, 19, reportedly tried to flee after two men on bicycles spotted him on top of the alleged victim in the early hours of January 18.

The pair managed to tackle him while a third man called the police, Santa Clara County prosecutors say.

After his arrest he was released on $150,000 bail.

The alleged victim was not enrolled at Stanford and was visiting the campus for a party, according to the district attorney’s office

Turner, an Ohio native, is expected to be formally charged today with five counts relating to the alleged incident, including rape of an unconscious woman, rape of an intoxicated woman and two charges of sexual assault with a foreign object.

'She was lying on the ground unconscious, not moving,' said Deputy District Attorney Alaleh Kianerci of the alleged victim.

'She’s recovering,' Kianerci added.

The woman was taken to the hospital and treated for her injuries.

If convicted Turner, who raced in the London 2012 U.S. Olympic trials, could face up to 10 years in prison.

He voluntarily withdrew from the university yesterday, Stanford spokeswoman Lisa Lapin told the LA Times.

Turner is also no longer practicing with his swim team.

Turner last swam for the university in a January 10 meet against Pacific, finishing third in the 1,000-yard freestyle and second in the 200-yard backstroke.

Heavy.com reports that Turner, originally from Ohio, swam for the Dayton Raiders before being recruited for Stanford and was a three-time All-American high school swimmer at Oakwood High School.

The alleged attack took place on Stanford University's campus in Santa Clara County

Some accomplishments include breaking the Ohio record for fastest time by a male 18 and under in the 800-meter freestyle, winning high school state titles in the 200 and 500 freestyle, and making the U.S. Junior National team. 

Stanford isn’t letting Turner’s athletic excellence obfuscate his alleged criminal behavior.

'This is something that the University takes very seriously, and the University took immediate action,' said Lapin to The Stanford Daily.

The former first year student is not allowed to re-register for classes and is barred from setting foot on campus, according to Lapin.

The alleged attack took place near some student housing and the Kappa Alpha fraternity house, but there is no indication the fraternity is involved in the investigation, she said.

Turner is expected to appear in court to enter a plea on Monday.

SFGate reports that Stanford is among the Universities criticized for having relaxed policies on sexual assault.

A law professor at the university, Michele Landis Dauber, has urged the school to make serious changes in their policies towards sexual assault.

Only four of the 175 reported sexual assaults at Stanford between 1997 and 2009 were properly investigated.

Dauber has called the statistics 'appalling.'

Dauber said that despite some improvement by the school in investigating sexual assault cases and acting for welcoming to victims, there is still room for improvement.

The school commended the cyclists who stepped in to save the alleged rape victim.

'Several students, both graduates and undergraduates, were upstanders in this situation,' Catherine Criswell, the University’s Title IX Coordinator, told the Stanford News Report.

'They made the courageous decision to intervene and provide assistance. That is exactly the type of leadership and caring we attempt to cultivate in our community, and we commend those students on their courage and quick response.'
