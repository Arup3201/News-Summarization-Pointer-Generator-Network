Ford is recalling about 65,000 Fusion midsize cars in North America because the ignition keys can be removed if the transmission is not in park.

The recall covers certain Fusions, including gas-electric hybrids, from the 2014 and 2015 model years. 

Ford traced the problem to a computer program in the instrument cluster.

Keys can be removed 30 minutes after the ignition switch is turned off if the cars are left in gear. 

That violates U.S. safety regulations and increases the risk of cars rolling away unexpectedly.

Ford says it's not aware of any crashes or injuries from the problem.

Dealers will reprogram the instrument cluster at no cost to owners.

The recall covers about 55,000 vehicles in the U.S., with the rest in Canada and Mexico. 

The Fusion is Ford's best-selling sedan in the U.S. market. 

Its sales through October this year were about 250,000, up 20per cent from the first ten months of last year.
