Teresa Giudice and husband Joe pleaded guilty to fraud charges on Tuesday - and now are both facing prison time.

The Real Housewives Of New Jersey stars each pleaded guilty to several 
counts including bankruptcy fraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud and 
wire fraud, and failing to pay taxes.

Under federal guidelines, 
Joe faces a potential sentence of 37 to 46 months and Teresa 
could get 21 to 27 months.

Teresa, 41, wore thick make-up and bouffed her hair for her appearance at the federal courthouse in Newark, New Jersey.

The couple arrived hand-in-hand and did not talk to reporters assembled outside.

They were asked by U.S. District Judge Esther Salas if they admitted their guilt, to which both replied: 'Yes, your honor,' according to NJ.com.

Sentencing is set to take place on July 8.

Their lawyer, Henry Klingeman, read a statement on Teresa's behalf after they left the courtroom.

'Today, I took responsibility for a series of mistakes I made several years ago,' she said. 'I am heartbroken that this is affecting my family — especially my four young daughters, who mean more to me than anything in the world.'

The plea deal comes after they pleaded not guilty last year to dozens of charges including bank fraud, wire fraud and bankruptcy fraud.

They were accused of exaggerating income while applying for loans before their Bravo reality show debuted in 2009, then hiding their fortunes in a bankruptcy filing after the first season aired.

They are also accused of submitting fraudulent mortgage and loan applications and fabricating tax returns and W-2 forms.

Joe allegedly failed to file federal tax returns for several years beginning in 2004.

Earlier this week it was reported the couple had struck a plea deal with the US Attorney's Office over the 41 counts of fraud.

Federal prosecutors previously said the couple faced up to 50 years in prison.

Joe
 likely will be given permission to remain in the country. Since he is 
an Italian and not a US citizen, he could have been deported after 
conviction, according to prosecutors.

The
 Giudices were charged with 39 counts of fraud last July plus two more 
counts in November. The charges allege that between 2001 and 2011 they 
engaged in conspiracy to commit mail fraud and wire fraud.

They
 were both charged with bank fraud, loan application fraud and 
bankruptcy fraud. Joe also is charged with failing to file tax returns 
for 2005-2009. They pleaded not guilty and the judge denied their 
request for separate trials.

Teresa
 has talked about her efforts to stay strong amid the legal trouble for 
the sake of her daughters: 13-year-old Gia, 10-year-old Gabriella, 
eight-year-old Milania and four-year-old Audriana.
