Manchester United will not be reviving their interest in Barcelona defender Thomas Vermaelen.

United have been linked  with a loan move for the Belgium international over the weekend but they are looking elsewhere - a decision made all the more understandable as he may yet need thigh surgery.

The 29-year-old centre-back cost Barcelona £15million when they signed him from Arsenal in August, but he is yet to play, having suffered an injury in Belgium's 1-0 World Cup group win over Russia in June.

Arsenal would not sell to United in the summer unless they included Chris Smalling as part of the deal, allowing Barcelona to step in but, so far, the transfer miss looks like a close escape for Louis van Gaal.

'We are worried for him and the medical staff are evaluating what's best,' said Barca sports director Andoni Zubizarreta.

'We don't know if Vermaelen is now going to need surgery. We are studying the situation.'
