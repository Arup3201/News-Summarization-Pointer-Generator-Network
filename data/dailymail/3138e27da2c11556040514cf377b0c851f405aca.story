Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop has slammed the US President Barack Obama over his speech made on the controversial issue of climate change at last week's G20 Summit.

Leaders at the summit turned up the heat on Australia's climate change in Brisbane over the weekend, which resulted in some of the world's largest economies declaring their support for strong action.

But Ms Bishop, speaking to ABC’s 7.30 program from New York, said there was an 'issue' regarding the president’s statement about the Great Barrier Reef.

‘I can understand the Queensland Government’s concern because the Queensland government and Australia have committed significant resources, funding and effort to preserving and conserving the Great Barrier Reef,’ she told host Leigh Sales.

‘Indeed, I believe that we are demonstrating world’s best practise in working with the World Heritage Committee to ensure that the Great Barrier Reef is preserved for generations to come.

‘And I think that president Obama might have overlooked that aspect of our commitment to conserving the Great Barrier Reef.’

President Obama said no country was immune to the effects of climate change and that everyone must play a role in fighting the global phenomena

On Saturday President  Obama told an audience at the University of Queensland that no country was immune to the effects of climate change and that everyone must play a role in fighting the global phenomena.

'Here in the Asia Pacific, nobody has more at stake when it comes to thinking about and then acting on climate change,' he said during his speech.

'Here a climate that increases in temperature will mean more extreme and frequent storms, more flooding, rising seas that submerge Pacific islands.

'Here in Australia, it means longer droughts, more wildfires – The incredible natural glory of the Great Barrier Reef is threatened.

‘I have not had time to go to the Great Barrier Reef and I want to come back and I want my daughters to be able to come back and I want them to be able to bring their daughters or sons to visit and I want that there 50 years from now.

Climate change wasn't on the formal agenda prepared by the Australia presidency during the G20, but supportive statements by President Obama ensured its inclusion in the final statement.
