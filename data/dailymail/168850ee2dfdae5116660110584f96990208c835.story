A woman died of a heart attack after an ambulance took more than an hour to answer a 999 call.

Grandmother Monica Lewis, 57, suffered from epilepsy and was having a ‘severe’ fit when her partner Harry Smith, 73, phoned for emergency medical attention.

The ambulance should have taken no more than 19 minutes, according to official guidelines.

While Miss Lewis waited, two ambulances on the way to her home in Croydon, South London, were diverted to ‘higher priority’ calls.

She deteriorated in Mr Smith’s arms, screaming, ‘I’m going to die’, until she finally had a heart attack, triggered by her fit.

Last night Mr Smith said: ‘If the ambulance had got here in time, she would have survived. That’s a fact.’

Monica’s daughter Gemma Senior said she was ‘disgusted and disappointed’ over the failure of the NHS, adding: ‘She only lived a ten-minute drive from hospital.’

Health experts said her tragic death on Friday was a stark reminder of the pressure that ambulance services were under.

Just hours after Miss Lewis died, NHS bosses unveiled a pilot scheme to give ambulances services in London and South West England more time to reach patients like her before breaching targets. The plan is the forerunner of a more radical idea – revealed last month by The Mail on Sunday – to more than double the time ambulances are allowed to reach the vast majority of seriously ill or injured patients. Instead of having eight minutes as a target, they would have 19 minutes.

Mr Smith called 999 at 12.29am on Friday telling the London Ambulance Service operator his partner of six years – a divorced mother-of-two with seven grandchildren – had started having a ‘severe’ epileptic fit.

He said: ‘Normally I’d never call the ambulance unless she had at least three seizures in a night, but this was different. It was so severe, and she was in so much pain. At one point Monica screamed in terror “I’m going to die!”

It was initially classed as a category C call, meaning a 19-minute response time.

All the while the 999 operator kept asking whether Miss Lewis was still breathing. He replied that she was.

That meant she was classed as a Category C ‘serious but not immediately life threatening’ incident, leading to two ambulances being diverted to other ‘higher priority’ cases in the space of 47 minutes.

At 1.16am the operator upgraded the call from Category C to Red 2, meaning she thought Miss Lewis was now in a life-threatening situation. The ambulance arrived at her Croydon almshouse at 1.39am but by then she had gone into cardiac arrest. Retired car mechanic and bus driver Mr Smith said: ‘When they finally came in, she had stopped breathing.

‘She was foaming at the mouth, with saliva and blood coming out, but she was not breathing.’ He added: ‘I want them to know they are responsible for the death of my precious, beautiful woman, who I called my wife.

‘We all have to die but she died a terrible death, she died in pain. She should not have died so young.’

Gemma, a 38-year-old accountant, got there shortly before 2am – driving four miles in eight minutes.

She said two ambulance vehicles turned up – first a single paramedic in a ‘fast responder’ car and, 20 minutes later, a fully equipped ambulance. She said: ‘The ambulance crew told me they had come from Brixton. I said, “What? Mayday Hospital [in Croydon] is only down the road!”

‘I’m so angry. The ambulance crews might as well not have come. I’m certain she was already dead when they arrived.

‘It could all have ended differently had the ambulance taken 12 minutes and not over an hour.’

Epileptic fits usually stop by themselves within half an hour, which is why they are not generally classed as life threatening. But some fits keep going, and the sufferer enters ‘status epilepticus’. Unless the sufferer receives emergency help, this can cause brain damage and death. It can also trigger a heart attack.

Simon Wigglesworth, deputy chief executive of the charity Epilepsy Action, said: ‘We find it shocking an ambulance could take so long to reach someone having status epilepticus, a known medical emergency.’

A London Ambulance Service spokeswoman last night offered their ‘sincere condolences’, adding: ‘We are very sorry that we were unable to send an ambulance response any sooner.’

London Ambulance Service has the slowest response times in England. National targets state 75 per cent of Red 2 calls should be reached within eight minutes. But in London in November only 55 per cent hit this target, compared with 68 per cent across England.

From February, 999 operators in London and South West England will get longer to assess Red 2 calls, before the ‘clock starts’ on the eight- minute target. The assessment time will rise from one to three minutes. The idea is to reduce the number of ambulances sent by mistake.

On Friday, NHS bosses wrote to Ministers stating there was ‘merit’ in a further plan to increase Red 2 target times from eight to 19 minutes.

If this happens, some Red 2 medical conditions will be permanently upgraded to Red 1 – where the target will stay at eight minutes.

Cyclist Michelle Cooper died after being sent home from hospital following an accident

A cyclist who crashed and hit her head died after she was sent home from a hospital that was so busy it was in a state of emergency.

Mother-of-four Michele Cooper, 52, was taken to Cheltenham General on Tuesday after being found in the road near her home.

She had been cycling back after playing tennis.

Her husband, Timothy, said she was taken to A&E, had a brain scan, kept in overnight, then discharged on Wednesday morning.

After coming home ‘she collapsed’, said Mr Cooper, 53, an insurance broker.

‘We don’t know what happened.’

The NHS trust that runs Cheltenham General and the Gloucestershire Royal, had declared ‘major internal critical incidents’ at both hospitals on January 5, to deal with what was described as ‘unprecedented demand’.
