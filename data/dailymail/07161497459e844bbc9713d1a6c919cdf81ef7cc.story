Another winter storm was taking aim at
the winter-weary U.S. Northeast on Saturday, threatening
blizzard conditions and severe cold in parts of New England
already buried under six feet  of snow.

Freezing gales were due to hit the snow-blighted Northeast along with as much as a foot more snow. Temperatures were due to be their lowest in decades New York City, with desperately cold wind chills freezing other parts of the region.

The latest storm was tracking east across the Great Lakes
and was expected to gather strength as it approaches the
Atlantic coast.

However, while much of snow-hit New England was struggling to dig its way out before another snowy onslaught, some people were making the most of the new winter weather.

'Alps of MIT': This five-story mound of snow, on campus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was piled up by plows from the six feet of snow which has fallen around the Boston area. The coming storm could add even more to it

We the (frozen) people: Snow was piled up around this statue of Sam Adams, stood in front of the famous Boston meeting-place

Scaled it: Four climbers celebrate at the top of the MIT mound, also referred to as Mt Cambridge by some

Snow hope: The storm, which is working its way towards the east coast from over the Great Lakes, could bring a foot of snow to the already-pummeled Boston area, with Maine due even more

Blow, winds: Gale-force gusts were predicted for parts of the coast - and even inland areas were due high winds in the coming storm

At the MIT campus, where plows have heaped up huge piles of snow scraped from the roads, a newly-formed set of hills have become a magnet for winter sports and climbing.

The newly-formed slopes, dubbed the Alps of MIT, have seen skiers, sledders, hikers and climbers ascend the five-story peaks.

Police have tried to cordon off the formation, but that has done little to deter the winter fun-seekers.

And the found may become even bigger in the coming storm, which the National Weather Service expects to spread a blast of arctic air and snow from the south of Canada all the way down to Virginia.

Scaling the heights: Students and locals took to the mounds of snow, putting sleds or even skis to use to get down again

All smiles: Two MIT students smile from the top of the snow piled up outside a hall of residence

Forecasters added that the most severe weather was poised for the New England coast
from Saturday into Sunday.

According to New York City mayor Bill de Blasio, lows of almost 0°F could hit his city - the worst cold experienced in twenty years. Further north and inland the cold be even more extreme. With wind chill factored in, the cities of Buffalo and Syracuse were due to feel as cold as -21°F Midday Sunday.

It prompted authorities to issue blizzard warnings for eastern Massachusetts, southern Maine, most of New Hampshire as well as Long Island, parts of Connecticut and Rhode Island.

The winds - with peak speeds of 75mph - are being predicted for Sunday, while across the region temperatures hover not far above 0°F.

Frigid temperatures combined with the high winds will being outside in the worst-hit areas feel more like standing in a brutal -21°F, according to forecasters.

In areas hit by extreme snowfall in recent weeks, the driving wind could whip up snow on the ground and cut visibility virtually to zero, putting lives at risk for any caught outside unexpectedly.

The strong winds could also cause chaos by felling trees and destroying above-ground power lines, leading to outages across the pummeled frozen areas - some of which will be colder than they have been in 20 years.

Snowed under: Large accumulations of snow were seen all around Boston - with this pile mostly obscuring a newspaper dispenser and parking meter

Help at hand: This photo, from earlier in the week, shows Massachusetts National Guardsmen helping to clear out the fallen snow in the town of Douglas

Boston, which has received about 6 feet of snow
in a trio of record-setting storms over the past three weeks, is
bracing for as much as 14 inches of new accumulation,
forecasts indicate.

Blizzard conditions are also expected in Rhode Island,
eastern Connecticut, New Hampshire and coastal Maine,
AccuWeather predicted.

Farther south, snow accumulation up to three inches was expected from Washington D.C. to New York City. 

With the newest band of winter weather, the town of Alton,
New Hampshire called off its annual ice carnival set for the
weekend due to concerns over massive snow squalls and freezing
wind.
