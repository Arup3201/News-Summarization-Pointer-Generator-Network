A circular metal antenna nicknamed 'the elephant cage' used to intercept radio signals during the Cold War-era will be torn down after 50 years of taking up space at Silver Strand Training Complex in Coronado, San Diego.

As part of a mission to get rid of items they no longer need, the Navy will dispose of the 1,300-foot-diameter contraptions known officially as the Wullenweber Antenna Array.

Wullenweber technology and the finer facts about its creation remain a bit of a mystery as do many details kept secret by the Cold War-era. The mysterious structures were peppered all over the world as a means of intercepting enemy radio signals from Eastern Europe all the way to the Middle East.

One of the few known facts about Wullenweber contraptions is that they were developed in Germany during World War II.

'It’s possible that the Silver Strand antenna is the last of its kind still standing', said Alex Bethke, a Navy historian assigned to the project. It’s been obsolete since the 1970s, reported UT San Diego.

A circular antenna was originally used to intercept and detect the location of various radio signals.

The reason the atenna is so big is so that it can have antennae listening in all directions.

'It listened in a lot of directions at once. So, instead of turning around to look for a signal — which is what a lot of systems did — it listened in all directions,' said a the naval analyst.

'So whatever comes in, it’s likely to pick up,” he said. “And that was a very big deal.'

UT San Diego reports that the antenna at Silver Strand had a range of 3,200 nautical miles and likely searched for signals in South America, the Pacific Ocean, and parts of Central America.

U.S. states such as California and Alaska weren't the only homes for these gigantic 'elephant cages.'

U.S. allies like the United Kingdom had an 'elephant cage' used to track signals coming from the former Soviet Union and from the Warsaw pact nations in Eastern Europe.

Another group of contraptions were located in Italy at the San Vito dei Norrnanni Air Station to intercept signals coming from the Middle East.

There were also antenna in West Germany, Japan, Canada, and the Philippines.

A United Kigdom array in Chicksands was dismantled following base closure in 1996 and the San Vito array was dismantled following base closure in 1993.

Misawa, Japan's Air Base’s massive Cold War-era network of 'elephant cages' were dismantled in 2013.

Even though the Navy is tearing down the structure itself, it will memorialize the structure by keeping the five tallest screens and some wires and anchorage posts.

They are also working on building digital 3-D model of the antenna.
