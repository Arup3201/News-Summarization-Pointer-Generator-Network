This dazzling video shows legendary English motorcycle trials rider Dougie Lampkin turning an ice hotel and snowy forest into his personal playground.

The Red Bull athlete travelled to the snowdrifts of north-western Finland, where he used his motorbike to climb fallen trees, blocks of ice and other obstacles.

He completed a variety of impressive stunts in the wilderness – including wheelies on a snow-covered trail – and inside the underground ice lair’s confined spaces.

Mr Lampkin used his motorcycle to climb fallen trees, cross a frigid stream and climb blocks of ice 

The fascinating scenes were recorded at a tourist attraction known as Snow Village in Finnish Lapland, nearly 125 miles above the Arctic Circle.

In freezing temperatures, Dougie races through the forest and rides through an ice-cold stream before arriving at Snow Village, a giant igloo made with nearly 775,000lb of ice.

With studded tyres on his motorbike, the 38-year-old professional rider displays the grace and finesse that have made him a 12-time world trials champion.

The ‘Tundra Trials’ video includes stunning aerial views captured by a drone flying high above the treetops and a spectacular time-lapse of the Northern Lights.

At night, Dougie uses his motorcycle to climb onto illuminated blocks of ice.

As a bonus the six-minute video produced by Red Bull ends with outtakes from the shoot, including some of Dougie’s wipe-outs and a clip of him walking across the frigid stream wearing a pair of hip waders.

Dougie, who was born in Silsden, West Yorkshire, and now lives on the Isle of Man, comes from a family of decorated riders.

His 64-year-old father, Martin, won the inaugural FIM Trial World Championship in 1975.
