Investigation: Michael McIndoe, who is said to have recruited fellow football players into the investment venture he said was run by City financiers

As many as 100 footballers may have been taken in by an alleged investment fraud which fleeced them of a staggering total of £30million, it is claimed today.

The players, including former top-flight stars Robbie Keane and Jimmy Bullard, are said to have been lured in by promises of big returns before the scheme imploded under the weight of its debts.

Detectives are now probing alleged links to gambling on football matches, the Sunday People reports. Police told the paper they believe it's the biggest swindle to ever hit British football.

A source close to the investigation was quoted as saying: 'In all, footballers are thought to have handed over up to £30million to those behind the scheme.'

The alleged scam was reported to the National Fraud Bureau last year and police are understood to be probing former footballer Michael McIndoe, who is said to have recruited fellow players into the investment venture.

The 35-year-old, who played midfield for Coventry, Wolves and Scotland, went bankrupt in October, the Sunday People says, with disclosed debts of £3million - a figure the paper says experts described as 'the tip of the iceberg'.

'The money lost has been astronomical,' an unnamed source close to the case told reporters Matthew Drake and Dan Warburton. 'The £3million mentioned in his insolvency papers is a very conservative figure.

'It could be up to £15million once all the money is traced.'

McIndoe is alleged to have enticed his footballing peers into the scheme - said to have been run by City financiers - with promises of returns of up to 20 per cent on their investments.

At least one line of investigation is that the failed fund may have in fact been a kind of Ponzi scheme, a type of scam in which early investors' returns are taken from the cash paid in by subsequent victims.

Such schemes always inevitably collapse, leaving all but the earliest investors out of pocket, but not before their operators are able to ride a gravy train of continual cash flow.

News of the investigation follows the surprise appearance of former Fulham midfielder Jimmy Bullard on reality television programme I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here.

At the time his place in the programme was revealed in November, reports claimed his appearance was down to monetary concerns that a thirst for publicity, after he lost £625,000 on the investment scheme.

Bullard, who at the height of his earning power took home £45,000 a week at Hull, pocketed around £100,000 for his appearance Down Under as he tried to recoup some cash sunk in the scheme. The 36-year-old reportedly told a friend he had 'been done out of a lot of money'.

Ireland and Spurs legend Robbie Keane, now of U.S. club LA Galaxy, was said to have lost 'a fortune'. Another player who asked not to be named, but who revealed he had played with McIndoe in the past, told the People he had lost £100,000.

Other alleged victims included players from lower league's and one individual who invested £60,000 inheritance bequeathed to him as a teenager. 

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'An allegation of fraud was made to Westminster CID in February. An investigation is ongoing. There has been no arrest.'

McIndoe proved difficult to track down. A call to the accountancy firm where several of his businesses were registered went unanswered. 

Named after one of the most notorious conmen in US history, the Ponzi scheme is an elaborate version of the oldest scam of them all - pyramid selling.

In its classic form, a Ponzi fraudster sets up a fund with a 'fail-safe' business plan. Investors join in their droves, lured by the huge returns on offer.

But the fraudster will merely pay off old investors with new money that comes into the fund. Eventually, all Ponzi schemes are doomed to collapse under the weight of new money flooding in.

The fraud was named after Charles Ponzi, an Italian who emigrated to America in 1903 with $2.50 in his pocket.

After a spell in prison for fraud, he set up an investment scheme to exploit differences in the price of postage stamps in Italy and the U.S.

At the height of his success in 1920, Ponzi was making $250,000 a day - a mammoth sum for the era. When his scheme collapsed, Ponzi pleaded guilty to fraud and was sentenced to five years in a federal prison.

Investigators in the case of Michael McIndoe's failed investment programme are exploring the possibility it may have been a Ponzi scheme
