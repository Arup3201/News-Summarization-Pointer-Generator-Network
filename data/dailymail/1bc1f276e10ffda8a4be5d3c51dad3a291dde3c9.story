Marlon King arrives at Nottingham Crown Court where he was jailed for 18 months today for dangerous driving

Former Premier League footballer Marlon King has been jailed for 18 months today for dangerous driving.

The ex Sheffield United striker was driving erratically and eating ice cream behind the wheel when he caused a three-car pile up on the A46 in Nottinghamshire last April, the court heard.

The footballer was seen weaving in and out of traffic before slamming on his brakes - causing another driver to perform an emergency stop.

Other drivers then smashed into his vehicle, Nottingham Crown Court heard.

One driver had to be cut out of his car before spending three weeks in hospital for a fractured and dislocated forearm.

King pleaded guilty to a charge of dangerous driving in March.

Sentencing King in court today, Recorder Paul Mann QC said: 'I do not regard your case as merely impulsive or silly behaviour.

'It was aggressive. It was arrogant.'

The judge handed King 18 months behind bars and a three-year driving ban.

The court heard that King committed the offence on his 33rd birthday while driving a white 2011 Porsche Panamera.

He was eating an ice cream he had bought from a McDonalds just moments before the crash, which happened at around 3pm on April 26.

King was seen weaving in and out of traffic before he undertook Martin Beck, whom he perceived as travelling too slowly in the outer lane of the A46, the court heard.

The former footballer slammed on his brakes in frustration, forcing Mr Beck to perform an emergency stop in his black VW Polo.

As Mr Beck came to a halt, another driver in a silver Vauxhall Astra who had pulled out behind him, collided with the stationary Polo.

The 'concertina effect' forced the Polo into the back of King’s Porsche.

Mr Beck had to be cut out of his car and airlifted to hospital after the collision at Winthorpe near Newark.

He spent three weeks in hospital and required surgery for a fractured and dislocated forearm.

Mark Bush, who was travelling in the Astra, was also taken to hospital for cuts and bruises.

The court heard how the ex-footballer was weaving through traffic on the A46 in Nottinghamshire while eating an ice cream from McDonald's. He then slammed on his breaks, causing a three-car pile up

The court heard that King drove off from the scene but was flagged down by another motorist who feared Mr Beck had been killed by the collision.

King returned to Mr Beck’s car, where he blamed the driver for the collision.

The judge told King: 'You were so pumped up with road rage, you had to start accusing him of being to blame for these collisions'.

King, born 26 April 1980,  is a professional footballer who plays as a striker. He was given an 18-month jail sentence following a conviction for dangerous driving today.

As of October 2009, King had convictions for 14 offences. He has previously served three jail sentences and has other criminal convictions including: fraudulent use of vehicle licence document, driving without insurance and theft from a person and from a car.

He was also convicted of two cases involving assault of young women rejecting his advances in the Soho area of London in December 2008.

King had his playing contract cancelled by Wigan after being convicted of the sexual assault charges. He was sentenced to eighteen months in prison.
