This motorist avoided decapitation by millimetres when he crashed his 190mph Corvette underneath a removal truck - by ducking.

The driver of the sleek sports car was travelling up a steep highway when he came up behind the slow-moving HGV.

He went into the back of the truck, causing the low slung Corvette Z06 to go underneath it; finally coming to a halt once the front of the sports car had gone six feet beneath the trailer.

Write-off: The Corvette was destroyed - but at least the driver was not badly hurt

I may have pranged it slightly: The HGV was going slowly when the Corvette went into the rear

The middle-aged driver ducked at the last moment and avoided potential decapitation, emerging relatively unscathed despite the carnage.

However, the high-powered Corvette was less than lucky and was completely written off in the smash.

The incredible incident took place on the southbound San Diego Freeway near Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles.

Retired LA firefighter Rick McClure, 60, was among the first to arrive at the scene.

He said: 'He was very lucky to say the least. In the past drivers have been decapitated after crashing underneath trucks so a law was introduced so they had barriers to prevent this.

'But somehow he still managed to get the Corvette underneath.

'It happened at about 11:10pm so the freeway was fairly open. It was an uphill stretch of the road and the truck was going slowly up the steep grade.

'The Corvette must have been overtaking a few other cars and then all of a sudden he saw the slowing truck and went up the back of it.

'I was first at the scene and it was unbelievable to see the guy in the Corvette talking. He had some minor injuries but was in good spirits considering what had happened.'

The driver was transported to the nearby Ronald Reagan Medical Centre with minor injuries.
