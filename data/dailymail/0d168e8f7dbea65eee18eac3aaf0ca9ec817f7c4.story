Fancy snapping up a designer dress worn by style icon Kim Kardashian? Now you can, thanks to a charitable auction that she and her famous friends are taking part in.

Kim is donating her stylish dress designed by Alexander Wang, which costs over £1,000, to a charitable clothes auction.

The StyleCycle auction has been launched by Vestiairecollective.com, a social site for the resale of designer and premium fashion.

Supporting sustainability in fashion, the campaign launches with a style insiders charity auction giving fashion lovers the opportunity to pick up unique pieces from their favourite celebrities and designers' very own wardrobes. 

Opening up the wardrobes of world's most stylish women and men, StyleCycle launches with a charity auction featuring pieces from 50 global style influencers ranging from fashion royalty such as Helena Christensen, to designers including Tamara Mellon and celebrities like Suki Waterhouse. 

Charitable: Kim has chosen Dream Foundation - the only national dream-granting organisation for adults and their families suffering life-threatening illness - as her charity and proceeds from the auction of her dress will go towards making an ill person's dreams come true

The proceeds of each item sold by celebrities, including Rachel Weisz, Laura Bailey, Stella Tennant and Hailee Steinfeld, will be donated to a charity of the style insiders' choice.

On the charity's website, it states: 'For families who have been financially devastated by medical expenses, a dream is the comfort of knowing the heating bill will be paid…For those with young children, it’s creating happy memories and having fun. 

'For young adults, a dream can be meeting a personal hero. And for children facing the impending loss of a parent, a dream is receiving support and compassion.

'Our dreamers have received a life expectancy of one year or less, and lack the resources to achieve their dreams on their own. While we cannot cure their diseases, we can dramatically impact the quality of their fragile lives with the joy experienced from a dream come true.'

Stylecycle carried out some research ahead of the auction launch and found that almost 30 per cent of clothing in the average wardrobe hasn’t been worn for over a year, whilst the average lifespan of a garment is currently estimated to be a mere 2.2 years. 

Extending the lifespan of a garment by just nine months will make a substantial difference to its resource impact, they claim.

Fanny Moizant, Co-Founder of Vestiaire Collective, said: 'We are really excited to be able to celebrate Vestiaire Collectives 5th birthday with such a wonderful and diverse selection of fashion insiders and Style Icons. 

'We wanted to pick out a wide cross section of different personalities who would each bring something unique to the StyleCycle auction. I can't wait to start bidding when it launches on Thursday.' 

Bids start at £0 so the site say that everyone has the opportunity to to win their favourite item.

They anticipate that Kim's Balenciaga dress, Cara's Mulberry bag and Caroline De Maigret's Chanel graffiti tote will be very popular.

The StyleCycle Auction will be available at stylecycle.vestiairecollective.com from the 6th to 14th November.
