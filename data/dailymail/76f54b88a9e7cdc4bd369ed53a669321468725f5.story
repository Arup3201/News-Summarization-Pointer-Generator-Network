The African-American actor who claims he was detained and questioned because of racial profiling while shopping at the flagship Manhattan branch of Macy’s last June has reached an undisclosed settlement with the retailer and the City of New York.

Rob Brown, who stared in the HBO series Treme and movies such as Finding Forrest and Don Juan, was detained for 45 minutes on June 8, 2013 after buying a $1,300 watch for his mother.

The Brooklyn-raised Brown, 30, said three white, plainclothes NYPD detectives quickly descended upon him and that he was handcuffed and paraded around the store until they realized their mistake and let him go.

Rob Brown had claimed he was detained and questioned because of racial profiling while shopping at the flagship Manhattan branch of Macy's last June

In a 42-page federal lawsuit filed last November, Brown charged that Macy's security ‘policies and practices have left... customers of color feeling victimized, humiliated, traumatized.’

In a second federal lawsuit against the NYPD, he leveled similar charges in a New York class action over the alleged ‘shop and frisk’ approach taken by cops against minority customers.

The NYPD is ‘continuing to enforce, encourage and sanction policies’ against customers at high-end retail stores ‘merely because of the color of their skin,’ the 31-page suit charged.

Brown has now reached a settlement ‘in principle’ in his twin actions against the department store and the city, according to Manhattan Federal Judge Lorna Schofield.

Macy's emphatically denied racially profiling Brown, but a spokesperson confirmed that it had settled 'in principle' with Brown after he brought a lawsuit against them

‘The court has been informed that the parties have reached a settlement in principle,’ wrote Schofield in court papers.

The actor had accused Macy’s and the city of false imprisonment, negligent training and civil rights allegations, reports the New York Post.

He was seeking unspecified damages and a court order forcing Macy’s and the NYPD to stop the alleged practice of targeting minorities who shop at high-end stores.

‘The lawsuits by various plaintiffs who alleged racial profiling by Macy's have been settled in principle,’ said a spokesperson for Macy’s.

Details of the settlement are still being finalized and Brown can refile his lawsuits within 60 days if the settlement falls apart.

Brown’s lawsuit had cited legal action brought by 14 other minority members based on incidents at other branches.

Brown stared as trumpter Delmond Lambreaux in HBO series Treme between 2010 and 2013

‘The specific, racially motivated abuses… constitute an on-going pattern and practice that has occurred and is continuing to occur in Macy's stores throughout the United States,’ the court papers alleged.

‘The disturbing truth is that Mr. Brown's harrowing ordeal was not an isolated event at Macy's, but is just one example of Macy's relentless and unlawful pattern and practice of ... disproportionately targeting its shoppers of color.’

Macy's emphatically denied racially profiling Brown, and insisted they were not involved in either the detention or questioning of Brown.

The actor said that he was accused of using a fake credit card to buy his mom a $1,300 silver Movado watch with gold trim on June 8.

According to an earlier state lawsuit brought by Brown he alleged that one of the cops told him that ‘he could not afford to make such an expensive purchase.’
