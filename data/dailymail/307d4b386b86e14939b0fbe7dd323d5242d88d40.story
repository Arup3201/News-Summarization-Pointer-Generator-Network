Suspect: Erbie Bowser was arrested last night after the shooting rampage

At least four people have been killed and another four injured in two related shooting incidents in southwest Dallas on Wednesday night.

Relatives of one of the woman killed in the shooting spree identified the suspect as the woman's 
ex-boyfriend, Erbie Bowser, a former Dallas Mavericks ManiAAC dancer.

Toya Smith, 43, and her 17-year-old daughter Tasmia Allen died in the shooting, as did another of her children, who has not yet been identified.

Toya's 14-year-old son Storm Malone was among those shot and taken to the hospital, according to WFAA.

One of Tasmia's 17-year-old friends was also shot and taken to hospital.

Radio station CBSDFW reported that when Bowser - an army veteran - did not find his ex-girlfriend at the address, he opened fire.

Two people were killed and two others wounded at that address.

He is then believed to have went to a home in DeSoto, Texas, where he reportedly used an explosive 
device to gain entry to the property.

After it detonated, he allegedly shot several people inside, killing two and injuring two more.

Sources said children were among the victims of the rampage on Wednesday night

The home belonged to his ex-wife, who hasn't been identified. It is not yet known if she is one of the victims.

Dallas police said the attack only ended when Bowser ran out of ammunition.

The distraught mother of one of the victims told NBC: 'And we could hear somebody gasping for breath in there and...I start beating on the door.

'I
 ran next door, across the street trying to get people to help because I
 had my cellphone but I didn't know to use my cellphone. Then she fell 
in my arms and she was bleeding and I moved her back to the sofa.'

WFAA
 reported that the gunman - believed to
 be a member of the military - tried to disguise himself as one of the 
injured but is now being questioned at DPD headquarters.

U.S. Army officials confirmed that Bowser served from October 1991 to November 2000, rising to the rank of staff sergeant.

Laura Jobe, a spokeswoman for the Mesquite Independent School District, told NBC Bowser was employed as a special education teacher from December 2001 to March of 2010.
