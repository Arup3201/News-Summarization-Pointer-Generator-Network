An Ontario university student has taken it upon himself to heal broken hearts - one song at a time

Kyle Forgeard, a Ryerson University film student, filmed by Elliott Slater who is studying film at Toronto Film School, enters packed university lecture theaters, singles out a girl and begins singing to her at the top of his lungs.

During the serenade he hands the bewildered girl a flower before leaving the lecture grinning ear to ear and generally to rapturous applause and laughter.

Sweet rewards: The boys score chocolate bars for their efforts

Forgeard and Slater's first video, featuring Forgeard singing acapella the 'cheesiest' love-songs he can find, quickly racked up 75,000 views in a week and now stands at almost 300,000.

For the next video, they added an acoustic guitar accompaniment by Niko Martinovic.

Dressed like he's going to church on Sunday with a white shirt tucked into black pants and a tie, Forgeard strides into packed lectures halls and starts belting out boy-band standards.

Lecturers, cut off mid-sentence, look at the interlopers askance.

Young women seated in the first row watch with bemused looks as the singing young man approaches, flower in hand, before it dawns that the performance is aimed at them and they are generally simultaneously embarrassed, amused and confused.

In one packed lecture theater at McMaster University, the whole front row receives yellow flowers, which couldn't fail to melt even the most angst-ridden college girl's heart.

At the University of Guelph the boys' reputations seem to have preceded them, as the lecture hall begins tittering as soon as they hear the opening strains of acoustic guitar.

In one lecture, Forgeard finishes up his love-song to a university student and begins to leave the lecture theater before turning back and serenading the stern-looking lecturer with John Mayer's Your Body is a Wonderland which has both the lecturer and students in stitches. 

At the University of Toronto Mississauga, a female lecturer who is serenaded is so touched she offers both young men chocolate bars for their efforts.

One professor who clearly believes in love from Guelph University holds his lapel microphone in front of Foregeard as he sings to amplify his dulcet tones.

'We didn’t think the professors would be so cool about it,' Forgeard told The Star.

'We thought some would [tell us to] get out and would tell us not to disturb the lecture.'

And while professors and students alike seem delighted by the unexpected mid-lecture music break, some university officials are less than pleased about the interruptions.

'We value the time of our faculty and our students, and must oppose activities that disrupt teaching and learning, however briefly, for purposes of entertainment,' Amy Mullin, vice-principal academic and dean of the University of Toronto Mississauga told The Star via email.

'We also cannot endorse having our students or faculty singled out for attention, possibly quite unwelcome, in the context of a love song when they are supposed instead to be teaching or learning,' she said.

Students do not agree with this attitude, though.

'It definitely made my day,' Elizabeth Thomlinson told The Star.

'Who doesn’t want a guy singing to her?'

Hilarity: The student sitting in front of the girl Forgeard is singing to is amazed by the unexpected turn of events

Amplified: This lecturer lends his microphone to Forgeard

Joy: The efforts of Forgeard, Martinovik and Slater result in a lot of laughter and a welcome respite from the rigors of academic work

'@KyleForgeard You seem to have missed Western on your rounds. Stop by. I like daisies,' tweeted a Western University student to Forgeard.

Forgeard and Slater say they serenade women to make people happy and the videos are not part of their coursework.

According to The Star, the pair have been making videos together since ninth grade.

Their YouTube channel, NelkFilmz, has received thousands of hits since they posted their university serenades.

'It’s a passion of ours,' said Forgeard. 'We want to grow our [YouTube] channel and make it big.'.
