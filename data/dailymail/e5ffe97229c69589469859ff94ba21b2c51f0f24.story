Carlo Nash will be sentenced today after being caught driving at 140mph.

The former Manchester City, Everton, Wigan Athletic, Middlesbrough, Crystal Palace, Stoke City and Norwich City goalkeeper was clocked by a traffic officer on the A11 at Wymondham in Norfolk.

The 40-year-old from Leftbank, Manchester, was stopped in a 70mph zone by a marked car with a speed detector on February 2 this year.

He did not appear at a previous hearing at Norwich Magistrates’ Court but the bench found the case proved in his absence.

The case was adjourned to allow Nash to attend.

Today’s hearing will consider imposing a diving ban and any other penalty.

Nash was released by Norwich City, where he was third choice goalkeeper, following their relegation from the Premier League at the end of last season.
