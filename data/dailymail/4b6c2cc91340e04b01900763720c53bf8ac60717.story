A woman who suffered six miscarriages has finally given birth to a baby girl - thanks to egg yolk. 

Lorraine Donakey, 23, from Liverpool, suffered six miscarriages in as many years before almost abandoning hope completely that she would ever have a baby.

But thanks to pioneering treatment involving injecting egg yolk into her system, Ms Donakey has now successfully gave birth to Lulu-Rose.

Lorraine Donakey, 23, gave birth to a healthy daughter - Lulu-Rose - after suffering six miscarriages in six years

Ms Donakey, who has a degree in forensic psychology, said: 'Finally having her in my arms is indescribable. When she was born I cried my eyes out.

'Every time I got pregnant I thought it would be different. I spent thousands on baby clothes and equipment for six babies that were never born.

'It was to the point where people wouldn’t dare tell me they were pregnant because they didn’t want to upset me. I didn’t find out about my brother’s baby until it was four months old.

'Even with the treatment I barely believed that my baby would make it, it was always "if" she made it.

Ms Donakey was told her miscarriages were caused by 'killer cells' in her body attacking the embryos

Ms Donakey had pioneering egg yolk treatment which involved injecting her with a solution containing egg yolk to suppress the 'killer cells' and allow Lulu-Rose to develop

'Now I’ve got Lulu-Rose I feel so lucky. She’s already spoiled rotten.'

Ms Donakey suffered
 her first miscarriage when she was just 17 and studying for her A 
Levels. She found out just hours before her exams that she had lost the 
baby.

The treatment is given to suppress natural killer (NK) cells in a woman's body, the theory being that some women’s bodies are non-baby-friendly and their immune system attacks the embryo as if it were a foreign body.

Intralipids — a mix of soya-bean oil, egg yolk, glycerine and water — are a fat emulsion used as a source of calories and essential fatty acids for post-operative patients and premature babies requiring nutrition into their bloodstream.

They have also been found to have an immuno-suppressant effect. The theory is that the intralipids have a stabilising effect on cell membranes, which makes it harder for the killer cells to attack and go on to cause implantation failure and miscarriage.

The fats are highly calorific — about 200 calories a dose, the equivalent of a Snickers bar — and have been likened to ‘getting an armful of mayonnaise’.

Administered via a drip usually twice before conception, and then three more times after, the treatment is thought to help the embryo implant and grow normally.

Alongside this, women are also recommended to take steroids, which further suppress the immune system, and blood thinners to prevent blood clots, which also can impede embryos implanting.

She said: 'I became 
pregnant by accident, but by the time I had a miscarriage I had come 
round to the idea of having a baby. I was devastated.

'Then I knew I wanted to be a mum and was determined to keep trying for a baby.

'But
 it always ended in heartbreak. The consultant at the hospital told me 
the hardest part of having a baby was getting pregnant, but I could do 
that bit, I just couldn’t keep the baby.

'When
 I went to the hospital each time it was like they knew me. Ann-Marie, 
my nurse, was fantastic. It was like she was going through it with me.

'But as time went on and I began to hate my body for what it was doing to me and my babies.'

After hearing about a new treatment available privately, desperate Ms Donakey turned to the internet to find out more.

There
 she found out about Rafet Gazvani, a fertility specialist at Liverpool 
Women’s Hospital, who was offering the pioneering treatment.

Ms Donakey underwent a womb biopsy and was told the reason she kept miscarrying was because of ‘killer cells’ that kept attacking the embryo.

She was treated using intralipid liquid, a mix of egg yolks and saline solution, which suppresses the 'killer cells' and allows the baby to grow.

She said: 'We had to pay to have the treatment privately. Luckily, my mum was able to help out and she put the costs onto her credit cards.

'With the other babies, I started preparing for their arrival. I probably spent thousands on clothes and things, but I didn’t dare with Lulu-Rose.

'Even on the way to be induced I still kept saying if the baby comes, it was never when.

Ms Donakey says that during her pregnancy with Lulu-Rose she was terrified of suffering another miscarriage so she took lots of vitamin supplements and avoided exercise

'I didn’t exercise and I took vitamins every day - I would line them up in the morning.'

Thankfully the treatment was successful and Lulu-Rose was born at  weighing 4lbs 14ozs on January 17 this year.

She said: 'Having six miscarriages definitely takes its toll, on my body and my mind.

'But I know I want more than one baby and now I know the treatment works.

'I want other women to know that this treatment is available, maybe it can work for them too.'
