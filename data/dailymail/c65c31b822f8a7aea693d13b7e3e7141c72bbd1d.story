The resistance at Dale Farm has ended with a mass exodus.

Travellers escorted their extremist supporters to the exit gates before themselves leaving the illegal site in a convoy of vans and caravans last night.

Many of the vehicles moved to the legal area of the Essex camp, sparking fears that the Battle of Basildon is not over.

On the road... but many of the caravans which have left the illegal pitch at Dale Farm in Essex have merely moved to the adjacent legal area of the site

Len Gridley, 52, whose home backs on to the illegal site, said: ‘It’s progress and good riddance to them. But some have just moved down the road and I am not going to be overjoyed until I am waving the last caravan goodbye.’

The exodus followed the toppling of a 45ft scaffolding tower that had become the symbol of the struggle. Bailiffs called in heavy machinery to demolish the structure, which a day earlier had been occupied by 20 activists.

The final scenes in the decade-long 
saga marked a victory for the council which has spent £22m of 
taxpayers' cash clearing the former scrapyard in Basildon, Essex.

Hundreds of riot police armed with Tasers stormed the site at dawn on Wednesday, swiftly gaining control despite facing a hail of bricks and being threatened with spades as two caravans were set on fire.

Sporadic resistance continued for most of the day, but by nightfall the Battle of Basildon was all but won after 27 arrests.

The
 officials made the final push yesterday as they smashed through a 
barricade to enter the site just before 10am. They used angle-grinders 
to hack away the chains that the last six anarchists had used to lock 
themselves to vehicles.

With virtually nobody left on the illegal pitch, a cherry picker 
crane nicknamed 'the eater' began tearing down the 'crow's nest' 
scaffolding at the entrance.

Around
 50 travellers watched proceedings from the adjoining legal site. More 
than 200 had been living on the site until court proceedings reached a 
climax last month. The other 150 are believed to have moved to other 
pitches around the UK.

Council
 leader Tony Ball said: 'Where we are now is where we would like to have
 been yesterday. We have residents leaving the site. The delay
 was caused by violent resistance in the morning and peaceful resistance
 in the afternoon.

'I am comfortable with the fact those carrying out the clearance are trained professionals and will behave accordingly.'

Mr
 Ball said the council has made travellers aware of alternative sites 
and made offers, which have not been accepted, to provide for the 
elderly, vulnerable and young.

Hundreds
 of police officers in riot gear maintained a protective line as workers
 dealt with the tower and removed three vehicles blocking the only road 
into the site.

However an Essex Police spokesman said officers would increasingly hand over to bailiffs now the site is secured.

Banners were draped around the site proclaiming ‘Save Dale Farm’ and accusing the authorities of ‘ethnic cleansing’, while children’s paintings were pinned to scaffolding.

There was no sign of the fierce resistance – including rocks and missiles – that greeted the drive to clear the camp on Wednesday. Instead, masked sympathisers contented themselves with sitting on a nearby roof, chanting ‘bailiff scum’.

One traveller, who gave her name as Elby, said she was heartbroken to see the tower come down. ‘It was like a monument to our cause,’ she added. ‘When we drove towards it, it was like we were home.’

There were fears that some activists would make a final stand last night with petrol bombs.

But the tension was defused by the plan hatched by travellers to escort their sympathisers to the front gate at 5pm.

The legal site the travellers moved to has 34 pitches with a maximum of two caravans or static buildings allowed on each.

Many families insisted they would not leave the area. One woman said: ‘I will stay in Basildon or somewhere in Essex. Maybe we’ll go and park outside (council leader) Tony Ball’s place. Essex is our home, for God’s sake.’

Superintendent Trevor Roe of Essex Police said 34 activists had been arrested for a range of offences in the clearance operation.

He said 11 officers had suffered minor injuries, including cuts and bruises, in the clashes.
