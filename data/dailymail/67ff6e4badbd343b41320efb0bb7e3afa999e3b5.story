A pregnant woman almost a week past her due date gave birth by herself on her driveway in frigid temperatures in Portland, Maine Friday.

Abigail Cain was in labor and about to leave for the hospital early Friday morning when she had no choice but to give but to give birth while standing in the driveway of her Gray home - in wind chills that reached minus-13 degrees.

Around 5:10am Cain, on the driveway leaning on the family car called her father Steve Bronish to tell him she and her husband Joseph Cain were headed to the hospital because it was time.

As Abigail Cain spoke to her father's partner Heather McLennan, she had a contraction, told McLennan she was going into labor and hung up the phone.

She leaned on the horn to convey the urgency of the situation to her husband, Joseph Cain, who was retrieving the last of the bags from inside the couple's home.

After the second contraction, Cain felt she had to push, her father Steve Bronish told the Sun Journal.

'With the second contraction, she felt she had to push. She pushed and the baby came out while she was standing next to the car,' said Bronish.

Cain had the car door open and was leaning on the seat when she gave birth to a seven-pound, five-ounce healthy baby girl named Danica AnneMarie Cain.

Joseph Cain emerged from the house to the sound of a crying baby and knew it could not be the sound of the couple's other child, two-year-old Tristan.

'He rounded the corner and there was mom and baby, all said and done,' Bronish told the Sun Times.

'Joe said she yelled to him, "I have the baby! I have the baby!"'

The couple called an ambulance and mom and baby Danica were taken to the hospital.

'It was 10 below out, and she had no help at all and out she came right in the driveway,' Bronish said. 'It's quite an amazing story. I'm pretty excited.'
