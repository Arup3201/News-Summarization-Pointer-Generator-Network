34 suspected members of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas gang, including four of its 'generals' have been named in a sweeping indictment charging the group with brutal crimes from murder to kidnappings and assaults. 

Ten of the defendants have been charged with offenses where a guilty verdict can mean the death penalty.

The remaining 24 face a maximum penalty of life in prison.

Foot soldiers: Several of the low level Aryan members, like Glenn Millican and Brian Thomas, who carried out murder and drug deals at the orders fo their white supremacist 'generals' were already in prison,

Dying in prison: Every brotherhood members named in the indictment, including Christopher Morris and Stephen Mullen, is either charged with a crime that can carry the death sentence or life in prison

Authorities call the Friday indictment a crushing blow to the feared prison gang.

'Today’s takedown represents a devastating blow to the leadership of 
ABT,' said Assistant Attorney General Breuer in an FBI statement.

'Four ABT generals, 13 
additional alleged ABT leaders, and numerous other gang members and 
associates are named in the indictment. As charged, ABT uses extreme 
violence and threats of violence to maintain internal discipline and 
retaliate against those believed to be cooperating with law enforcement.'

'Brutal beatings, fire bombings, drug trafficking and murder are all part of ABT's alleged standard operating procedure.'

The indictment details horrific methods of keeping a their inmate members in line.

In one case a 'general' ordered a subordinate to kill a gang prospect and return his severed finger.

As the prison system began to desegregate in the 1960s, prisoners grouped together along racial lines and the Aryan Brotherhood was formed in California's San Quentin. Originally devoted to protecting its white members above all else, the gang has now grown into a vicious criminal enterprise with business in drug trafficking, prostitution, and murder. An estimated 20,000 current and former inmates belong to the organization and mark themselves with distinctive tattoos like the swastika. Though the gang only makes up 1 per cent of the prison population it is suspected to be responsible for as many as 20 per cent of the homicides behind bars.

In another, an ABT member was ordered to burn a tattoo from a fellow Aryan's arm for not following orders.

'This multi-year investigation and indictment clearly targets the 
worst-of-the-worst among the ABT,' said FBI Special Agent in Charge 
Morris in an FBI announcement.

The superseding indictment charges the 34 alleged members with conspiracy to participate in racketeering activities, three murders, multiple attempted murders, kidnappings, assaults, and conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine and cocaine.

Authorities say the gang works as five regions, each controlled by a 'general.'

Orders to kill were decided by a steering committee called the 'Wheel.'

The indictment names Terry Ross Blake, 55; Charles Lee Roberts, 
68; Larry Max Bryan, 51; and William David Maynard, 42, as generals for the ABT.

Blake and Roberts were arrested Friday while Bryan and Maynard were in prison already.

Bryan is charged in the fatal shooting
of  prospective ABT member who allegedly stole drugs he was ordered to 
deliver to a customer south of San Antonio on the gang's behalf.

If found guilty he could face the death penalty.

He's currently serving a 30 year sentence for heroin delivery handed down in 1991, and is eligible for parole next year.

In the shadows: From behind bars the ABT organized drug deals, murders and assault all around the state

Maynard was imprisoned in 2003 on his fourth conviction, a 75-year sentence for murder conspiracy.

The indictment also named four women who were arrested Friday.

Women are not allowed in the gang but are used to help members with phone calls, internet access, and using the postal system to pass along messages - including orders to kill.

According to the FBI, the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas was first organized in the early 1980s inside the Texas prison system.

The gang looked to another white supremacist prison gang, California's Aryan Brotherhood, as a base to model themselves on. 

While the ABT's original goal was to offer protection for white inmates and encourage white separatism, they allegedly expanded into a violent criminal empire.
