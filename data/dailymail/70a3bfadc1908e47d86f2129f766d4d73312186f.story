A Florida woman was arrested earlier this week after police say she broke into the home she previously shared with her ex-boyfriend and their three young children and threatened to chop off the childrens' heads with a machete.

According to authorities in Valusia County, Florida, police were called to the home of Carlos Quinones about 4 p.m. Tuesday after his ex-girlfriend, 32-year-old Alisa Lynn Williams - while wielding a machete - broke into the house and threatened the former couples' 7-year-old twin boys and 6-year-old daughter.

When police first arrived at the home, they found Williams sitting on the porch covered in blood, according to an arrest report first obtained by the Daytona Beach News-Journal.

Quinones told authorities that Williams barged into the home with the machete before being disarmed and pushed out the door by Quinones and his father.

According to the report, two neighbors overheard Williams saying she was going to 'cut off their heads,' referring to the three children.

After Quinones removed Williams from the home, she attempted to get 
back in by breaking a window and climbing through the shards of broken 
glass, which cut her.

Williams, Quinones told police, has been 
living in the woods for the last two weeks after she moved out of the 
house because of drug and alcohol problems. After Quinones put her 
belongings on the porch of the home, Williams returned on Tuesday. 
According to Quinones, she was out of control and tearing the screens on
the windows while armed with a machete.

This isn't Williams' 
first scrape with the law - MailOnline has found records of at least four
other incidents for which Williams was taken into custody, including 
busts in 2005 and 2006, both of which resulted in battery charges.

On two other occasions, Williams was arrested for drug possession offenses.

Jail.
