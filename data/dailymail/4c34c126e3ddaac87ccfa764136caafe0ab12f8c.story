Pope Francis has made a remarkable break in protocol by delivering an off-the-cuff homily and posing for 'selfies' during Palm Sunday celebrations.

The Pontiff joined around 100,000 Romans, tourists and pilgrims in St Peter's Square in Vatican City today to commemorate Jesus's entry into Jerusalem before his crucifixion.

In a startling move, he abandoned his prepared homily and spoke entirely off-the-cuff to the crowds, who were waving olive branches, tall palm fronds and tiny braided palm leaves shaped
 like crosses.

Making a speech: Pope Francis has made a remarkable break in protocol by delivering an off-the-cuff homily and posing for 'selfies' during Palm Sunday celebrations

Remarkable: In a startling move, Francis abandoned his prepared homily and spoke off-the-cuff (right), while he also sipped 'mate' passed to him from worshippers (left)

And he continued to stray from the script - climbing off his Popemobile to pose for 'selfies', hugging young children and babies and even sipping cups of 'mate', a tea-like drink, passed to him from worshippers.

In his 15-minute homily, Francis called on 
people, himself included, to look into their own hearts to see how they 
are living their lives.

'Has my life fallen asleep?' Francis asked 
after listening to a Gospel account of how Jesus's disciples fell asleep 
shortly before he was betrayed by Judas.

'Am I like Pontius Pilate, who, when he sees the situation is difficult, washes my hands?'

Packed: Thousands of people turned up for Palm Sunday Mass, which opens Holy Week for the Roman Catholic Church. Above, St Peter's Square in Vatican City today

The Pope, wearing red vestments to symbolise blood shed by the crucified Jesus, appeared to be tired and frequently paused to catch his breath as he spoke during Palm Sunday Mass, which solemnly 
opens Holy Week for the Roman Catholic Church.

'Where is my heart?' he asked, citing that as the 'question which accompanies us' throughout Holy Week.

But despite his apparent fatigue, Francis seemed to regain his wind 
after the two-hour ceremony - shedding his vestments to chat amiably with cardinals, who were dressed more formally than him at that point.

Waving: Standing aboard his Popemobile, Francis waves to crowds following the Mass, which commemorated Jesus's entry into Jerusalem before his crucifixion

He later posed for 'selfies' with young people from 
Rio de Janeiro who had carried a large cross in the square, before climbing back aboard his open-topped Popemobile.

However, he had 
barely sat down when he spotted several Polish 
youths also clamoring for a photo.

Without even waiting for the vehicle to fully stop, the Pope hopped off and took another 'selfie' with the youngsters, who could be seen beaming widely at the camera. 

Caring: Francis, who aspires to put people on the margins of life at the centre of the church's attention, used a wooden pastoral staff carved by Italian prison inmates

Looking jolly: He then climbed back aboard his open-topped Popemobile, but had barely sat down when he spotted several Polish youths also clamoring for a photo

And in another remarkable moment, the 
Vatican's security chief poured herbal mate tea from a thermos - thrust 
toward the Pontiff by someone in the crowd - into a mate cup, before passing it to Francis for a sip.

At
 the start of the ceremony, crowds presented their olive tree branches, 
palm fronds and braided palm leaves to the Pope for a blessing.

Holy
 Week culminates next Sunday with Easter Mass, which is also being held in St Peter's 
Square.

Many worshippers will remain in Rome, while others will pour into 
the city for the canonization of two popes, John Paul II and 
John XXIII on April 27.

During today's ceremony, Francis noted that John Paul's long-time aide, now Cardinal 
Stanislaw Dziwisz of Krakow, Poland, had come to Rome.

He added he would be making a pilgrimage to South Korea this summer, with the key 
event being an Asian youth gathering on August 15 in Daejeon.

It comes as millions of other Christians around the world have also been celebrating Palm Sunday with frond waving, processions and prayer.

In
 Jerusalem, worshippers prayed at Deir El Sultan in the Church of the 
Holy Sepulcher, traditionally believed to be the site of the crucifixion
 and burial of Jesus.

Meanwhile, celebrations were also carried out at Gaza's Church of Saint Porphyrius in Gaza City, the Samaan el-Kharaz Church in Cairo, Egypt, and churches in Bhubaneswar, India.
