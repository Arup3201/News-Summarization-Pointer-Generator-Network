Manchester United's first team stars looked in high spirits as they prepared for their quarter-final clash against Arsenal at the club's Aon Training Ground.

The likes of Wayne Rooney, Radamel Falcao and Marouane Fellaini were put through their paces by Manchester United's coaching staff as they geared up for Monday night's fixture.

Louis van Gaal has revealed ahead of the upcoming match at Old Trafford that his side's main focus is sealing qualification for next season's Champions League campaign, however the Dutchman will be hoping his players are fully prepared for the visit of Arsenal.

The Dutchman previously said his primary objective for his first season in charge of United was to win a trophy, however he now appears to have changed his stance.

Van Gaal, speaking ahead of his side's upcoming match, said: 'I always want to get the goals what we have set. And the goals we have set is the top four.

'A title is fantastic. When you win the FA Cup you are not in the Champions League which is important for the club, but you have won a title. So for the players it is fantastic, for the manager it is fantastic but our goal is to reach in our first year together a place in the Champions League.

'I think that for a club the Champions League is the highest level. To finish in the first four is a fantastic result, I think. And for us, Manchester United, more I think.'

Manchester United captain Rooney will be particularly desperate to help his side progress to the semi-finals as the 29-year-old is yet to get his hands on an FA Cup medal.

In fact, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata are the only members of Manchester United's current crop of players to have won an FA Cup winner's medal.

Meanwhile, Manchester United defender Jonny Evans took part in training despite being hit with a lengthy suspension.

Evans will miss his side's next six games after spitting at Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse during his side's 1-0 win at St James' Park.
