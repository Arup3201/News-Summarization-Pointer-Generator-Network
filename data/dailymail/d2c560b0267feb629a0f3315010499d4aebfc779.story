Like an old comedian reprising an ancient routine, Harry Redknapp turned in a bold and breezy post – match performance last night. His timing was slick, his patter engaging and his confident assertion that better times lie just ahead carried a degree of conviction. Then we remembered his team's performance, and we realised he was tap – dancing on a trap – door.

For Rangers are every bit as poor as their League position suggests. Bereft of ideas, pace, intelligent cohesion and adequate ability, they fail just about every test which the top division imposes upon its members. A more confident, more ruthless side than the current United would have buried them beneath an avalanche of goals. But even this United were eventually able to impose themselves with the minimum of challenge.

Redknapp's version of events was rather different, as you might expect. He was 'very pleased with the performance'. He insisted it was 'one of our better home performances'. He believes, mysteriously, that 'we're very difficult to play against'. And he is indignant about the newspaper story which started rumours concerning his imminent departure. 'I've spoken to the chairman five times this week, and he never mentioned it', he said.

Now I have no idea of what passed between manager and chairman, but the rest of his claims were patent tosh. The only surprise of the entire, dreary afternoon was that the last rites were delayed until the final few seconds, when the United substitute James Wilson was allowed to saunter through a broken defence and score at his second, leisurely attempt.

Louis Van Gaal had justifications of his own to make, since even in victory United seemed but a shadow of the sides which once terrified England and most of Europe. 'We played in the first half the way QPR wanted us to play – through the air, long balls', he said. 'You have to play along the ground, despite the fact that the ground is not good here. He spoke of needing to 'stretch the pitch', to make better decisions. But his conclusion was beyond challenge: 'When you win', he said, 'everyone is happy'.

Well, everyone bar the neutrals, who endured a parody of Premier League football for much of the match. The first half proceeded at pedestrian pace, with a sada absence of enterprise all round. Last week, QPR players were exchanging insults with their fans at Burnley, having lost their latest match on the road. Now they played like a side which was terrified of making an error. And United were almost equally inhibited, smothered by a tactical caution which seems alien to the spirit of the club.

They might have settled to their task early on when a series of attacks, instigated by Jonny Evans' driving run, culminated in a comfortable chance for Radamel Falcao. But the keeper was looming, the confidence was lacking and the shot was hastily ill – directed.

As ever, Rangers looked desperately to Charlie Austin, and he did his best to answer the call half - way through the half, collecting a ball from deep and violently driving from 25 yards. David De Gea met it with a flying parry and a fist – clenching freprimand to his defenders. In truth, there was much to criticise. United are blessed with enormously expensive and extravagantly talented attackers, but they were constrained by the caution of their approach.

'Attack, attack, attack!', demanded the visiting fans. Then they pleaded for 4 – 4 – 2, as if the fault lay in the system rather than the approach. It was sadly undistinguished fare, which also became a trifle spiky, with the otherwise anonymous Joey Barton – who had earlier escaped unpunished for a palpable trip on Wayne Rooney off the ball and in the box – being booked for a studs – up challenge on Evans, and Juan Mata being punished for a clip of Barton's heels. 

At half time, Mata was replaced by Marouane Fellaini, and soon after Wilson came on for Evans, allowing United to revert to a back four rather than the formation despised by the fans. And by now United were finding the gaps which had eluded them. In 56 miniutes, Angel Di Maria's cross was met inside the six yard box by Falcao and provoked a fine save from Rob Green. Then two minutes later, the break through. Antonio Valencia sped down the right, released a low cross and Fellaini was given time and space to pick his spot and strike his scoring drive.

As the game opened up, so Rangers grew more desperate. Adel Taarabt was brought on, a move of last resort from Redknapp. Then a wretched United misunderstanding on the half – way line allowed Eduardo Vargas a clear run on goal, which he let slip with his chronic indecision. Had things gone remotely right for Falcao, then the game would have been put to rest. But twice he came within inches of searching crosses, with the goal gaping an invitation.

Later, the Rangers manager would detail some of his side's shortcomings, there being no time to go through the full list. But eventually he became almost philosophical about his personal future. 'I can only keep doing my best', he said. 'We've got as good a chance as anybody. What will be will be'.

The routine was almost word – perfect. But the punch – line has yet to be delivered.
