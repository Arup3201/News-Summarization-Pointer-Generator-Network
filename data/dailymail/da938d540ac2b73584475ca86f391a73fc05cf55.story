As Manchester City are faced with the daunting task of overturning a 2-1 aggregate deficit in the second leg of the Champions League last 16 against Barcelona on Wednesday night, midfield powerhouse Yaya Toure has shown he is not letting the pressure get to him. 

Strapped to heart monitors and presented with a series of pictures ranging from a cute golden retriever puppy to the Champions League trophy and Barcelona playmaker Andres Iniesta, the 31-year-old's pulse rate remained steady throughout. 

City have never progressed to the quarter-finals of Europe's elite club competition and will have to be at their absolute best to pull off a special result at the Nou Camp if that is to change, but judging by Toure's show of confidence, the Ivorian is certainly up for the match against his former club.

The video Toure was starring in was part of a promotional campaign for Nissan, who are official sponsors of the Champions League. 

Toure joined City from Barcelona in 2010 for a reported £24 million fee and has since gone on to become one of the Sky Blues' most important players. 

Meanwhile, Iniesta, who played alongside Toure for the Catalan side while he was there, is well aware of his old team-mate's capabilities. 

'He is very important for them, he is very powerful physically and he has important qualities because of all his skills,' the Spaniard said.  

Car manufacturers Nissan are one of the official sponsors of the UEFA champions League 

Barcelona playmaker Andres Iniesta is widely regarded as one of the Catalan side's best players
