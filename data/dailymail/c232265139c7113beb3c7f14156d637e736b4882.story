Double pay: Andrea Stark remained on a £100k-a-year salary while working outside the Arts Council

A senior manager at the Arts Council is to leave the organisation next week with a six-figure redundancy cheque after taking a six-month paid sabbatical.

Andrea Stark has been allowed to work for an outside organisation while still picking up her £100,000-a-year salary from the quango that distributes public money to the arts.

The sabbatical leave has meant she has qualified for a redundancy payment of at least £100,000 because the Arts Council is abolishing her job next month.

Miss Stark would not have been entitled to a redundancy payment had she resigned last autumn to take up her new role in charge of High House Production Park, a largely taxpayer-funded enterprise that makes sets for the Royal Opera House.

The deal means Miss Stark will have been paid close to £200,000 by the Arts Council since she left the organisation last autumn.

She is understood to have been on annual leave, on full pay, between October and the beginning of this year, when the paid sabbatical period started.

However her real job for the past eight months has been chief executive of High House, which is heavily funded by public money.

Her appointment as chief executive of High House was announced last autumn by Tony Hall, now BBC director general but then chief executive of the Royal Opera House and chairman of High House.

Miss Stark has not been paid by High House since last October. But one of her first actions in the new job was to join a party which made a taxpayer-funded visit to Rio de Janeiro and Salvador in Brazil ‘to create new dialogues about social and personal transformation through the arts’.

The arrangement for Miss Stark drew condemnation from taxpayer pressure groups. Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘This is another example of the Arts Council squandering public money.’

The deal is likely to prove embarrassing to Mr Hall as well as to Arts Council chairman Sir Peter Bazalgette and the minister in charge of the Government department that pays for the Council, Culture  Secretary Maria Miller.

Miss Stark, who began her career as a community theatre director in London, joined the Arts Council in 1999.

Among grants it announced last year were £10million for the Royal Opera House and £1million for the High House operation. The Arts Council said Miss Stark was entitled to a sabbatical as part of a long-standing contract.

A spokesman said: ‘We are not able to publish an individual’s redundancy payment until after they have been made. This is because until the final payment is made the calculations are subject to change.’
