A 12-year-old girl who was threatened with expulsion from school for refusing to cut her natural afro hair has been told she can return to the classroom without having to have a snip.

Vanessa VanDyke, who is a student at 
Orlando’s Faith Christian Academy in Florida, had been suffering taunts 
over her hairstyle from fellow students.

When her mother, Sabrina Kent complained about the issue, surprisingly, school administrators appeared to side with the bullies and told Vanessa that her hair violated school dress codes for being a ‘distraction.'

Vanessa says that she was given one 
week to decide if she wanted to cut her hair, and if not, she would have
 to leave the school.

At the time she said that she felt her hair was part of her identity and for that reason, did not plan to change it.

Now it appears that school officials have relented against their insistence that Vanessa cut her hair  and have welcomed her back into the classroom.

Vanessa and her hair were addressed Sunday during a church service sermon at a faith-based assembly.

'We hope that the student and that we would put this behind them and continue to excel in the Christian eduction,' said school board member Carl Jackson.

'We love Vanessa. We want her back and we are not asking for any alterations and we want her back.' Jackson told Local 6

School leaders changed their stance over the Thanksgiving break, saying they want her to return even with her current hair style.

Vanessa now hopes she can move on without being taunted by other students.

‘It
 says that I’m unique,’ Vanessa told Click Orlando. ‘First of all, it’s 
puffy and I like it that way. I know people will tease me about it 
because it’s not straight. I don’t want to fit in,’ she continued.

Ms
 Kent says that school administrators targeted Vanessa after she 
approached them about the excessive teasing Vanessa was receiving from 
fellow students over her hair.

School officials initially pointed out that Vanessa's hair violated school policy stating that ‘hair must be a natural color and must not be a 
distraction,’ and cites mohawks, shaved designs, and rat tails as 
distracting examples.

The 
school says that Vanessa’s hair qualifies as a distraction. Vanessa's mom, Ms Kent said the policy required a wide interpretation: ‘A distraction to one person is not a distraction 
to another. You can have a kid come in with pimples on his face. Are you
 going to call that a distraction?’

Vanessa's mother, Sabrina Kent, said her daughter was happy to return to school. She said she didn't want her daughter in the spotlight anymore and should the bullying or teasing continue, she would take further action.
