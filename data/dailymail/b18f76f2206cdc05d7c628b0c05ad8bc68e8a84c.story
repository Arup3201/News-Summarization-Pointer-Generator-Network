A mother of three appeared in court today accused of smuggling 100 kilograms of cocaine, with a street value of £44 million, into Heathrow Airport.

Shopkeeper Paula Sanchez, 32, was arrested at her home in north London on Friday, following a sting operation, after the drugs were found in a food package that arrived from Ecuador on Friday night.

Sanchez and two alleged accomplices, Martha Santiago, 35, and Gilmar Gil Solano, 24, have been charged with  conspiracy to import Class A drugs.

Customs officers found 100 kilos of cocaine hidden in a food package that arrived at Heathrow on a flight from Ecuador on Friday night

Sanchez appeared at Thames Magistrates Court today, where she was remanded in custody to appear at Maidstone Crown Court on August 31.

Santiago and Solano are due to face magistrates later today.

The package is thought to belong to a major South American drugs cartel.

Drugs cops confiscated the drugs and then allowed the package to be delivered to an address in Muswell Hill.

After seizing the drugs, they allowed them to pass through the airport and followed them to Muswell Hill, in north London

The court heard how police followed and watched as the 'drugs' were transferred from one car to another in a suburban street.

Police swooped and arrested two women and one man after the deal had taken place.

Ruona Iguyovwe, prosecuting, told the court the investigation into the alleged smuggling ring was ongoing.

She said: 'The information police found would have to be shared with other jurisdictions.

'There are further suspects involved in the case and the investigations are continuing.'

She added: 'On June 28th officers from the UKBA discovered a consignment of 10 boxes of food packages weighing 290kg. Within the package officer found 100kg of cocaine.

'The shipment was from Ecuador but destined for an address in Muswell Hill.

'The packages of suspected drugs were taken to the government laboratory where they tested positively for cocaine.

'Officers allowed the package to be delivered on June 29 to Muswell Hill. A vehicle was seen leaving the address with the packages and meeting a Vauxhall Corsa on a side street.

'Officers watched as the boxes were transferred from one car to another. They saw Ms Sanchez accept a enveloped containing £2700 in cash.'
