If you are struggling to find the motivation to go to the gym this January, these honed and toned models may just give you the extra push you need.

Whether they are covered in paint, handcuffed to a radiator or trailing a parachute, the stars of these high-octane ads for Equinox gyms provide some impressive fit-spiration.

The campaign, shot by famed photographer Rankin, is an extension of last year's Equinox Made Me Do It adverts, and sees the models in a series of questionable situation.

The hunky models in Equinox's Equinox Made Me Do It campaign will get you in the mood for hitting the gym

Hot hunks: The campaign stars a series of models all of whom have got into a bit of trouble 

The idea of the campaign is that getting into shape can get you into a little bit of trouble. One shot features a woman with a freshly shaven head, razor in hand. 

Another captures a man in women’s clothes, staring proudly into the camera, and one depicts a man who has seemingly stolen a fountain.

Carlos Becil, Chief Marketing Officer for the brand, said that the gym's members are the inspiration behind the campaign. 

'Our members were the true inspiration behind the Equinox Made Me Do It campaign, and this year we saw an opportunity to evolve the narrative and the stories portrayed,' he said. 

'Everything we do at Equinox is grounded in the idea of high-performance living, empowering our members to be bold, be risk takers and push their limits, inside and outside of the club. 

This campaign embodies that pride and the adventurous spirit that speaks to the idea that it's about more than just taking risks, it's about owning the consequences.'

Rankin spoke of his pride at being involved in the campaign saying: 'I was excited about the prospect of creating their next campaign as it couldn’t have been closer to my style.'

The British-born portrait and fashion photographer is well known for his exciting and enticing images, he has also shot a series of videos to promote the gym.

During his extensive career he has shot famous faces such as Kate Moss, the late Michael Jackson, Robert Pattinson and Jay Z. 

Research says that more than two thirds of us will sign up to the gym this month in a bid to beat the Christmas bulge.

However, more than a third of those people who sign up will have quit by the end of the year.

Powerful: One of the images in the campaign shows a man standing proud in women's clothing, while another shows a woman who has stolen a tiger
