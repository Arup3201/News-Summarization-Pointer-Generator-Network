A promising American exchange student has plunged to his death from a five-story building in the Czech Republic, just days into a six-week European trip.

Authorities said 21-year-old Keaton Alan Klein was alone when he plummeted from the balcony of an unidentified building in Prague on July 14.

US Embassy officials do not suspect foul play and are still investigating the tragic death. His body has been returned to his family in Nebraska.

The University of Nebraska business student was in Prague with about 15 classmates.

The group was traveling through Europe, also stopping in Barcelona, Madrid and Pamplona, before undertaking a four-week exchange program at Oxford University in England, Ohama.com reported.

Klein, or 'Keater' to his loved ones, set off on his overseas adventure on July 5. His family didn't know it would be goodbye forever.

'I was like this isn't real, this isn't real, this isn't real, I kept thinking I was gonna wake up,' his heartbroken mother, Julie Klein, told KLKNTV.

Klein's girlfriend, Karli Gaines, said he was probably watching the sunrise as his friends slept before he died.

She said her adventure-loving boyfriend 'was living his dream' in Europe, finally fulfilling his dream of running with the bulls in Spain.

The 2011 Lincoln Lutheran graduate loved to surf and ski, and went out of his way to make people laugh.

'He made me the happiest person and he didn't even have to do anything to make me happy,' Gaines told 1011now.com.

'There was always a smile on your face when you're with him. It's going to be hard not to have him around, that's for sure.'

Klein's younger brother Jaxson said he was in shock when he heard the news.

'I thought they got the wrong person, wasn't him,' Jaxson said. 'I didn't believe a word that they were saying. Just, in disbelief.'

The funeral service is scheduled for July 24 at Christ Lutheran Church in Lincoln, Nebraska.
