Robert McGinlay, 20, posted intimate photographs on Facebook of him and his ex-partner having sex

A spurned boyfriend posted so-called 'revenge porn' photographs on Facebook showing him and his ex-partner having sex. 

Robert McGinlay, 20, took the intimate images of him and the woman during their relationship.

But, when their affair ended, he posted the image on the social media site, where it was seen by hundreds of friends.

His horrified victim, who was alerted to the image by her  friends, reported the incident to police, who arrested the jilted boyfriend.

McGinlay, of Moodiesburn, Lanarkshire, later told officers that he put up the picture out of spite following the break-down of their relationship in December last year.

He also confirmed to officers that he had been in a relationship with the girl and that he had already deleted the image since posting it.   

At Airdrie Sheriff Court, the warehouse worker admitted acting in a threatening or abusive manner and causing fear or alarm towards his victim by posting a sexually graphic image of her on a social media website.

Depute fiscal Gordon Crawford said: 'While he was in a relationship with the complainer he had taken a photo of himself and the complainer engaged in a sexual act

'When they fell out any sense of leave or balance went out the window and in what is known as "Revenge Porn", he posted the picture of the sexual act on Facebook thereby showing it to the world to get back at the complainer.

'When notified the complainer got onto Mr McGinlay and contacted the police. Before he knew she was going to the police he deleted the photo, regretting what he had done.'

Sheriff Petra Collins deferred sentence until January and called for reports.

She added: 'I will be calling for a victim impact statement from the complainer before I can pass sentence.'

McGinlay pleaded not guilty pleas to a charge of posting a sex video of him and the woman on Facebook and intentionally causing her to look at the footage.

Prosecutors also accepted his not guilty plea that he had sent sexual written communications to his victim. 

Revenge porn is the distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress.  

The Scottish government is planning to introduce a new law to tackle revenge pornography.

It intends to make it a specific criminal offence to publish explicit images of someone without their consent.

The Lord Advocate, Frank Mulholland, has suggested a specific offence may help deal with what he has described as a 'growing problem'. 

New legislation has already been drawn up for England and Wales. 

Last month, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling vowed to clamp down on revenge porn. He announced it would become a criminal offence, with a maximum jail term of two years.  

Victims of revenge porn have previously found it difficult to have pictures removed from the internet.

Many sites where the images are hosted are based outside the UK, and requests to remove content are often ignored. In some cases, asking for removal results in more attention being brought to the images.

The move to clamp down on 'revenge porn' came after 149 cases, the vast majority of them involving women victims, were reported over two and a half years. Only six led to prosecutions.
