Half-term and holidays make for happy times - but also high levels of tension in relationships.

Being together 24/7 with no respite from each other or the children isn’t easy - which is why I thought it timely to write about how to have love that lasts. These are the things that I think really count:

Don’t try to control each other. They aren’t you and you aren’t them so stop trying to turn them into you by controlling what they do or trying to influence how they think.

Be tactful, be kind and hold back the really nasty stuff you're desperate to blurt out in the middle of a an argument

Don’t take everything personally Your partner’s behaving like a right so-and-so? It could be they just got off the phone from their mother having a rant or they’re worried about work. You’re not the only person and thing influencing your partner’s moods.

Talk about the happy times. Especially when you’re going through a rough patch. Remind yourselves of how good you are together when things are normal.

Do lots together, no matter how mundane. Whether it’s the weekly shop, washing the dog, eating dinner on your laps in front of the telly, it all counts. Quality ‘’you two’ time is important but one ‘date’ a week isn’t going to beat spending time together frequently, no matter how routine it might be.

Watch your language There’s a reason why this is mentioned in every relationship article. Say ‘I feel this way’ not ‘You made me feel this way’. Don’t make sweeping generalizations like ‘You never do this or that’ or “You’re always late’.

Tracey Cox says half-term and holidays make for high levels of tension in relationships

Touch each other constantly. Both sexually and affectionately – and make sure you know the difference.

Know each other’s ‘raw’ spots. Be sensitive to vulnerabilities, rather than use them to score points. If your partner’s down, be extra nice and they’ll return the favour when you’re not feeling so chipper.

Don’t always assume the worst. He didn’t make the effort to come and see your Mum in hospital? Instead of assuming they did it deliberately ask why. Perhaps they didn’t realise how important it was to you. Spell out your needs very clearly and don’t expect your partner to mind-read.

Honesty isn’t the best policy. To be 100% honest, you would have to express every fleeting sexual thought you have about others and every negative thing you think about your partner. Neither are wise. Be tactful, be kind and hold back the really nasty stuff you’re desperate to blurt out in the middle of a an argument.

Don’t try to change the other person. Don’t play the ‘if only’ game. If only they were kinder, richer, happier, had more hair. We can’t change other people. All we can change is our reaction to them.

Put yourself in their shoes. Before you react defensively, see it from their point of view. Then speak.

Don’t do all the work in the relationship. If you’re always the one who steps in to solve things, you don’t give your partner the chance to try. You feel resentful for doing all the fixing, they feel controlled.

Treat your partner the way you treat your friends. We wouldn’t dream of speaking to friends the way we do our partners. Have some manners.

Silence is deadly. Fine to shut up until you’ve calmed down but not speaking for days on end is incredibly damaging. The longer you don’t get on, the bigger the argument becomes.

Make your own rules. You’re unique, so is your partner and so is your relationship. People like me can rattle on all they want but only you two know what works for you.
