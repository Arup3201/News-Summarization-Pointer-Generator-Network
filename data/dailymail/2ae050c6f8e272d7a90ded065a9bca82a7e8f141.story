The shimmering lead-cut crystal teardrops of a large chandelier that hangs precariously from the rotting ceiling joists offers a hint of the house’s former grandeur. As do the expensive swag curtains hanging incongruously as a backdrop to a rubble-strewn floor.

This is The Georgians, a home once owned by the Saudi royal family. Its cracked walls are covered in moss patches, weeds grow through the plaster, pigeon and rat droppings litter the rotting carpets and the swimming pool is  covered in green slime.

Yet this husk of a home is worth about £30 million, even in its ruined state. The reason? It sits on tree-lined The Bishops Avenue in North-West London — as famous for its Billionaires’ Row nickname as for its tasteless architecture — which was proclaimed last month the second most expensive road in Britain.

Sad fate: The Saudi royal family once owned The Georgians on The Bishops Avenue - better known as 'Billionaires' Row'

Left to rot: A lead crystal chandelier and swagged curtains are all that¿s left of The Georgians finery

Former grandeur: Walls have been left to crack with weeds growing through the plaster

Just a couple of mansions away, on the same street, is The Towers, another gigantic mock-Georgian edifice in ruins. Paint flakes off the walls, the ceilings have disintegrated and weeds sprout on the vast double staircase.

A few hundred yards down the  avenue is another palatial home, Redcroft, also empty. Mould and algae cover the tiles of its pool, damp seeps through its ceilings and discarded mattresses and furniture litter its rooms. Two more homes nearby — Dryades and Ilkley House — have also met the same sorry fate.

This prestige address reflects an extraordinary and disturbing new trend in the property boom in which multi-millionaire overseas home-owners leave houses empty and untended for years on end, until they become derelict.

There are some 15 unoccupied and dilapidated mansions on The Bishops Avenue, worth as much as £350 million. The super-rich who own them are confident that even if they leave the properties to rot they will still get a tremendous return on their investment when they sell up, because of increasing land values.

Since they have houses all over the world, these wealthy men need not set foot in these ruins. And because they can afford to leave them empty, they benefit from tax concessions most of us who actually live in our homes can only dream of.

Renovation costs on houses left empty for more than two years are eligible for a reduced VAT rate of just five per cent compared to the normal 20 per cent. In addition, if these gargantuan, wrecked properties are demolished, and a new home constructed on the site, building costs are not subject to VAT.

Valuable: Decaying properties like The Towers will still recoup a huge profit

Tread carefully:  Ferns and weeds now climb its dilapidated staircase

By stoking demand for such multi-million-pound properties, these potentates are pouring fuel on an already roaring housing market — which means the prospect of home-ownership further down the chain is spiralling far beyond the reach of countless families and young couples.

Why has The Bishops Avenue become a road full of deserted mansions? And why are more and more wealthy foreigners using London’s property market as an investment?

The Bishops Avenue used to be owned by the Church of England in the 19th century, and its homes were on vast, leafy and attractive plots of land a short walk from Hampstead Heath and within easy reach of the City of London.

Soon industrialists such as William Park Lyle, of Tate & Lyle sugar fame and George Sainsbury, the son of the supermarket founder, as well as cinema and musical hall stars such as Gracie Fields moved in.

By the 1940s the street became the butt of comedians’ jokes because of the increasingly ostentatious homes springing up and the influx of  nouveau riche inhabitants such as  holiday camp king Billy Butlin. In the Sixties, the rich were building what a London Borough of Barnet council official noted as ‘often unscholarly and dull or aggressively modern and incongruous’ homes.

With worldwide political and economic unrest in the Seventies, oil and shipping magnates from across the world began buying up properties on the street which was by now earning a reputation as being the British equivalent of Beverly Hills in LA. Over the decades affluent businessmen from Greece, the Middle East and Africa all bought on the Avenue. The Sultan of Brunei acquired  several properties. More recently, Russian oligarchs have moved in.

Meanwhile, the owners started to compete with their neighbours to build the most opulent mansions.Halis Toprak, a Turkish industrialist, bought a huge 30,000 sq ft home there, named it Toprak Mansion and installed a bath big enough for 20 people. Inevitably, locals nicknamed it ‘Top Whack Mansion’.

As the Avenue’s international reputation grew, land values soared. Lakshmi Mittal, the Indian steel magnate and once Britain’s richest man, bought the Summer Palace in 1996 for £6.75 million and sold it in 2011 for £38 million — a profit of £2 million for every year.

Dryades was bought in about 2005 for £12 million by a Pakistani former minister. The property was seized in 2011 by Deutsche Bank after a lengthy High Court battle, and put on the market for £30 million.

Heath Lodge, where fashion tycoon Aristos Constantinou was shot dead in 1984, was bought for just £400,000 in the Seventies and is today estimated to be worth £14 million.

Ten of the homes now standing vacant were owned by Saudi princes. They invested in the British property market because they feared Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was about to invade their homeland and seize their vast wealth.

These mansions were sold last year and are to be redeveloped — ‘when’ is open to question. Many of the houses are purchased by offshore companies, and Land Registry documents show a paper trail leading to Panama, the Bahamas and the Channel Islands.

This desire for anonymity has robbed The Bishops Avenue of any sense of community spirit, however. Many owners have spent a small fortune screening their property from the road, and some years ago, a council report lamented how many of the homes were becoming ‘intimidating’ fortresses to keep prying eyes out.

Around a third of the houses on the exclusive row are currently standing empty

Given the continuing demand for homes on the street, owners are understandably confident that even if they leave the properties empty to rot they will still get a tremendous return on their investment.

There is one snag, however. Wildlife enthusiasts claim that the numerous nooks and crannies in these derelict properties are now inhabited by bats and owls. And since all species of bat and their roosts are protected by law, developers could be prevented from knocking down the dilapidated houses, as well as making extensive refurbishments.

Civitas, the free-market think tank, has proposed a ban on foreign buyers outside the EU buying homes, claiming that in 2012, at least 85 per cent of prime property was paid for with money from overseas.

But London is still seen as a safe investment, with no sign of an end to ‘land-banking’ and tasteless development on The Bishops Avenue and surrounding cul-de-sacs.

The council lists several of the houses — many adorned with turrets, weather vanes and curly gables — as neo-Jacobean, neo-Georgian or Colonial Georgian.

Now, to add insult to injury, the properties are not only vulgar but falling down. And if the bats and owls have their way, they will remain derelict for a very long time to come.
