An ex-girlfriend of paedophile Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins was today charged with possessing and distributing indecent images of children.

Joanne Mjadzelics, 38, was arrested as part of Operation Globe, a worldwide investigation into Watkins's child sex activities.

The singer, from Pontypridd, was jailed for 35 years at Cardiff Crown Court last year after being found guilty of a string of sex offences, including the attempted rape of an 11-month-old baby.

Prosecution: Joanne Mjadzelics, 38, an ex-girlfriend of Paedophile Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins, has been charged with possessing indecent images

Mjadzelics, a former private banking manager with the Royal Bank of Scotland, had an on-off relationship with Watkins from 2006 onwards.

The pair met through the social networking site Myspace after she tried to get tickets for a Lostprophets concert.

Partner: Joanne Mjadzelics met Watkins online and they had an on-off relationship with the singer for several years

She has been accused of four counts of possession of an indecent image of a child and two counts of distributing an indecent image of a child.

She has also been charged with encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence of distributing an indecent image of a child.

She has been bailed to appear before Cardiff Magistrates' Court on March 21.

The charges were brought after the CPS asked South Wales Police to look in to the alleged offences which date back to 2011.

Suzanne Thomas, senior crown prosecutor of CPS Wales, said: 'As part of a wider police investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service was asked by South Wales Police to review evidence files relating to alleged offences committed by Joanne Mjadzelics.

'I have reviewed this evidence in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to charge Joanne Mjadzelics with four counts of possession of an indecent image, two counts of distributing an indecent image and one count of encouraging another to distribute an indecent image.

'Accordingly, I have authorised South Wales Police to charge Ms Mjadzelics with these offences and she has been bailed to appear before Cardiff Magistrates' Court on 21 March.

'May I remind all concerned that Joanne Mjadzelics has a right to a fair trial. It is very important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings. For these reasons, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.'Â 

Criminal: Cardiff Crown Court heard that Watkins was 'a determined and committed paedophile engaged in serious sex offences involving two babies'
