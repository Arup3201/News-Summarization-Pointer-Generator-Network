A river of caramel is threatening to engulf a Brazilian town after a warehouse fire melted more than 30,000 tonnes of sugar.

Firefighters were today still battling to control the blaze 70 hours after it started at the industrial site in Santa Adelia, Sao Paulo.

The fire swept through the warehouse - which supplies sugar to the entire state - causing streams of caramel to flow out 
of the building, onto roads and towards people's homes.

Concern: Hundreds of locals have already been moved from their homes for fear of being engulfed in caramel

Hundreds of locals have already been moved from their houses into hotels for fear of being engulfed in the sugary substance - with others barricading their doors with sandbags and earth. 

The free-flowing caramel is also believed to have contaminated a local river - with dead fish appearing as far as five miles from the blaze.

However, workers' efforts to stop the caramel from spreading have been hampered by the fact it is thick and cannot be siphoned off like water, police told G1.

The blaze, which struck the warehouse - owned by distributor Agrovia - on Friday, is believed to have started on a loading conveyor chain.

Locals have been warned that many more tonnes of sugar are still expected to be burned at the plant, and that they should prepare for the worst.

As well as supplying Brazilian towns with sugar, Agrovia's plant in Santa Adelia exports 1.7million tonnes of the product around the world.

Last week, another fire at a warehouse belonging to Copersucar, Brazil's biggest sugar exporter, at Sao Paulo's port of Santos, destroyed 180,000 tonnes of sugar.
