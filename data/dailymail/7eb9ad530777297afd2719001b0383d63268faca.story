Downton Abbey hearthrob Dan Stevens could be fluttering the hearts of the nation once more as the BBC's next Mr Darcy, it has been revealed.

Fans of the ITV1 drama were left devastated when Stevens's character, Matthew Crawley, was killed off in the Christmas special after Stevens decided to leave the programme.

But reports have emerged that Stevens could be set to play the Jane Austen hero, Mr Darcy, in a BBC adaption of P.D. James's 2011 novel Death Comes to Pemberley.

Downton Abbey fans were heartbroken when Dan Stevens's character, Matthew Crawley, was killed off in the Christmas special

Stevens will have big shoes to fill, 
after women across Britain fell in love with Colin Firth as Darcy in the
BBC's 1995 adaption of the novel, set in the eighteenth century.

Death Comes to Pemberley uses the same characters as Pride and Prejudice and is set six years later, when the characters Elizabeth and Mr Darcy have two children.

Elizabeth's sister Lydia bursts into their marital home with news that her husband, the devious George Wickham, has been killed, and a murder mystery ensues.

Other candidates for the lead role 
include War Horse star Tom Hiddleston and Les Miserables actor Eddie 
Redmayne, who starred in the BBC adaption of Birdsong last year.

Matthew
Goode, who us now in BBC2's Dancing on the Edge and Hugh Dancy, who 
played Grigg in the film The Jane Austen Book Club, are other potential 
candidates to play Darcy.

BBC controller of drama, Ben Stephenson, said: 'There are certain characters from a book who go way, way beyond the page.

Colin Firth was a huge success as Mr Darcy in the 1995 BBC adaption of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice

'And
Mr Darcy is absolutely one of them. He is the iconic romantic lead - 
brooding and intense. The very name "Darcy" has come to mean something 
beyond Pride and Prejudice alone,' he told the Sunday Times.

Filming for the three-part drama is set to start in the summer. Actresses being considered to play the role of Elizabeth include Felicity Jones, from the BBC drama The Diary of Anne Frank, and - controversially - Claire Danes, of U.S. show Homeland.

Producer of Death Comes to Pemberley, David Thompson said: 'Yes, she's American, but of course she can do British.

'She is married to a Brit, Hugh Dancy, Imagine the two of them together in the new TV series as husband and wife.'
