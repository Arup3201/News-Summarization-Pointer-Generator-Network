The driver of a £100,000 Bentley who allegedly crashed his luxury car through a garden wall has been charged with drink driving.

Kalber Phagura, 38, was arrested after his car mounted the pavement and smashed right through a 3ft high garden wall in Rainham, Kent, on Sunday.

The car then collided with the house and dented a car parked in the driveway.
