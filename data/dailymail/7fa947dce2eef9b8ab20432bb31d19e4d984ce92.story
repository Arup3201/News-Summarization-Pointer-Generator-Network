Residents in a former pit village will be keeping a close eye on the behaviour of their neighbours today.

The village of Rawmarsh in South Yorkshire is at the centre of lottery fever amid claims that one of its inhabitants has finally claimed the £81million EuroMillions lottery jackpot. The draw was made on May 28 but the prize was not immediately claimed.

Shopkeepers in Rawmarsh, near Rotherham, claim lottery operator Camelot contacted them to say customers should check their tickets for the winning numbers  – and that soon got the rumour mill whirring among the 18,000 inhabitants.

Paramjit Singh, of  the Sohal Mini Market, said: ‘It seemed they were still looking for the winner and they were from round here. Our customers were very excited but it was none of them.’

One resident was the centre of attention after he was photographed next to a flash car and then loaded the picture on to Facebook.

But he was quickly exposed as a fake.

Sharon, a shop assistant at Claypit News, said: ‘He was getting everyone to buy him drinks down at the Titanic pub, saying that he was waiting for the cheque to clear.

'He had a good night but it’s not him.’

The owner of a florist is now in the frame after it unexpectedly closed down late last month.

Camelot last night confirmed the sixth-largest winner in British lottery history had claimed their prize but had opted for anonymity.

A spokesman said: ‘It could be an individual, it could be a syndicate and they could be from anywhere.’
