It’s an experience that many of us have been through - you wake up after a night out with a feeling of dread, worried about what you did the night before.

And, thanks to Facebook and Twitter, there are numerous reminders about your antics posted online.

The Sobrr app has been designed to make this feeling a little less permanent by letting you post as many drunken updates and photos as you like, before they're automatically deleted after 24 hours.

Users start by posting a photo on Sobrr (pictured left), which is seen by people in the same geographical area. These nearby people can choose to 'Cheer', comment, or add the user as a 24-hour friend. Once the request is accepted, users can send messages, and after 24 hours, the friendship is deleted unless both sides tap Keep

The Vibing section is the photo feed. Users can post photos and view photos by others posted in the past 24 hours.

To ‘Cheer’ a photo - which is similar to liking a post on Facebook, or selecting a user on Tinder - drag the image to the right.

To ‘Pass’ a photo, and remove it from the feed, swipe it to the left.

The Sobrr Chat function lets users send private messages to friends using a username or phone number.

Sobrr is free and available from the Apple App Store.

But
 non-iPhone users can still receive and view text and voice messages 
from Sobrr users through SMS where they will be directed to a browser 
through a link - and these also expires after 24 hours.

It even deletes friendships that you made overnight, too.

Sobrr was co-founded by developer Bruce Yang after a night out in Vegas.

‘With Sobrr, you are free to be your crazy self wherever you are,’ explained Yang on the Sobrr blog.

‘Enjoy your life in the moment and have fun. Sobrr will make sure there is no evidence of your craziness. You will always be ‘sober’ online.

'Unlike other social media, Sobrr is not about what you did, but what you’re doing.’

The self-destruction feature of Sobrr is similar to Facebook’s Slingshot.

The tech giant's self-destructing message launched last month and is designed to appeal to fans of Snapchat and other messaging apps that let people send self-destructing messages to friends.

However, the app adds a novel twist, as users cannot see a friend's picture until they send one back.

After downloading the app, users sign up either with a Facebook account or a phone number.

After taking a photo, users can type a message of up to 140 characters on it, draw a picture or send a 15-second video.

They can then send it to some, or all, of their Slingshot contacts.

On Slingshot, users can see a message only if you send one back. 

Until they do, they'll only see a pixelated preview of what's in store.

The self-destruct feature is similar 
to Snapchat and Facebook’s Slingshot, but the developers claim Sobrr is 
different because photos are only shared within the user’s geographic 
area.

‘Most people don’t remember over half of what they did or said the day before, and it doesn’t make sense that your phone does,’ said co-founder Bruce Yang.

‘There certainly are things that happen in Vegas that you would prefer they stay in Vegas.’

The Vibing section is the photo feed.

Users post their own images, and view photos by others, uploaded in the past 24 hours.
