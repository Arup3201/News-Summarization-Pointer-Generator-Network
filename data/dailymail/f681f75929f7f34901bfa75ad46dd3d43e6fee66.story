As Tottenham prepare for their first cup final in six years, Paul Scholes says the players must show they have the courage to perform under pressure on the big stage.

Spurs face London rivals Chelsea at Wembley on Sunday in the Capital One Cup final seven years after winning their last piece of silverware - against Sunday's opponents in the same competition in 2008. 

And while  Scholes admits that Chelsea have plenty of big-game experience the former Manchester United midfielder says Mauricio Pochettino's side have it all to prove.

'There is something about a cup final that brings out a different quality in a footballer,' Scholes wrote in his column in the Independent. 'Do they have the courage to win a one-off match? Quite simply, do they have the balls to take risks? 

'We know that the current Chelsea team is capable of seizing the moment. The question marks are more about Tottenham this Sunday.

Under Argentine boss Pochettino a number of young players have been given a prominent role in the side and Scholes has urged them to take the opportunity to claim a winners' medal in the fledgling careers.

'The Capital One Cup final is a great opportunity for the likes of Harry Kane, Ryan Mason and Nabil Bentaleb to get a medal early in their careers.

'I am sure that they will all have very good careers but it comes down to how much you have won in the end, and winning finals is difficult. On Sunday we will find out what this good young Spurs team are like when the pressure is really on.'
