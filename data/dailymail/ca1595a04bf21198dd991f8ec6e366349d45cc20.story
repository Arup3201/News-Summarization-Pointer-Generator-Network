NSW police are using advanced hacking software to spy on phones and computers during investigations. 

Documents published by WikiLeaks on Monday name NSW police among a long list of clients of Gamma International, a European supplier of spyware capable of remotely tracking computer use.

The documents show the force has spent about $2.5 million on software that can break into computers and phones, log keystrokes and take screenshots.

Some versions are also able to remotely capture Skype and instant-messenger conversations and access microphones and web cameras.

NSW police have held nine licences for various forms of the software, including FinSpy and FinFly, during the past three years, the documents show.

Five licenses remain valid.

A police representative declined to comment on the grounds the technology "relates to operational capability".

NSW law allows police to remotely monitor computer use under warrant.

No other Australian agencies were named in the documents, but other clients include police in countries as diverse as South Africa, Singapore and Italy.

It's believed the documents were sent to WikiLeaks after they were obtained in a hacking attack in August.

The software has previously been criticised for enabling oppressive regimes to spy on dissidents.
