A Las Vegas man’s apartment was searched and cordoned off by police after he was presumed dead and mistaken for a look-alike who had committed suicide.

Rob Ponte, 31, a Zappos employee, was shocked when he got home Monday night to see his apartment sealed with coroner’s tape.

When he went inside he could see that investigators from the Clark County coroner’s office and Las Vegas police had rummaged through his drawers and his computer had been searched.

Look-alike: Rob Ponte, 31, a Zappos employee in Las Vegas, was assumed dead after police and coroner's investigators thought he looked like man who was found dead near his home Monday

‘They were searching for a suicide note,’ Ponte told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

Police had found the dead body of a man in an alley at 330 S. 7th St, near Ponte’s Towne Terrace home.

An apartment manager had given them a copy of Ponte’s driver’s license, according to Clark County Coroner Mike Murphy, who said the two men looked similar.

Although the identity hadn’t been established through fingerprints or other scientific tests, investigators proceeded as if the information was correct, he said.

‘Honestly, it looked like it was that guy,’ Murphy told the Review-Journal. ‘[The photo] was certainly close enough for us to think it was him. So we started from there.’

Suicide: Ovik Banerjee, 24, a University of North Carolina graduate, has been identified as the man who killed himself by jumping from a nearby building, according to authorities

His office released the jumper’s real identity on Wednesday.

The dead man is Ovik Banerjee, a University of North Carolina graduate, who came to Las Vegas as a fellow in the 2012 class of Venture for America, a program that connects graduates with businesses.

The 24-year-old worked with the Downtown Project, a $350 million real estate development and small business and technology investment project to revive downtown Las Vegas, according to his personal website.

Banerjee’s death was ruled a suicide.

‘We are deeply saddened by the passing of our friend and colleague Ovik Banerjee,’ a Facebook post from the Downtown Project stated.

‘He was a caring, bright, and incredibly kind person, and he will be missed.’

The post prompted an outpouring of support and grief from dozens of people who described Banerjee as ‘an amazing light’ and someone who ‘spread enthusiasm and kindness’.

'Caring': Banerjee's personal website says he was from Alabama. The 24-year-old was described as a 'caring, bright, and incredibly kind person' by the Downtown Project

According to Banerjee’s personal website, was from Alabama and had degrees in biology and environmental science.

‘I firmly believe that everyone in the US should dedicate at least a year of their life between the ages of 18 and 26 to service, because at no other point in one’s life is someone as able-bodied, energetic, and unencumbered by other obligations,’ Banerjee wrote in a post dated October 2, 2012.

On his Twitter page, Banerjee called himself an ‘explorer, adventurer, entrepreneurial apprentice, and inquisitive twenty-something looking for new experiences.’

His last Twitter post, on January 1, asked fellow Vegas friends for a lift from the airport for a ‘wayward Indian’.

It is not clear why he committed suicide.

Not going to sue: Ponte says police apologized to him for their mistake but added that it was a violation of his privacy. He does not plan to take further action

Ponte says police apologized to him for their mistake, according to the Review-Journal.

Murphy said coroner’s investigators don’t need a warrant to enter someone’s home and secure the property, unlike detectives investigating a possible criminal case. A suicide investigation is a civil matter, he said.

‘We’re protecting property,’ he said. ‘Part of what our job is to do is to inventory it so some friend with a key or manager doesn’t come in and start taking stuff.

‘We’re not looking for criminal activity, we’re looking for information related to the incident, and information that may lead us to the next of kin.’

Ponte said someone called his mom, but she didn’t answer. Thankfully, they didn’t leave her a voicemail, he said.

He said he doesn’t plan to sue but was slightly annoyed at the inconvenience.

‘It wasn’t a mess but clearly everything was rummaged through so I felt my privacy was violated. But I do understand how it would have happened.’
