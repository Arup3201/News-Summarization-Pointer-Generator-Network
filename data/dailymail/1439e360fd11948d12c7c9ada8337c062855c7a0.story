It's Saturday, August 16, 2014. As should be the case in the middle of summer, the weather is glorious and Anfield is humming with anticipation ahead of the new season.

The fixture list has presented Liverpool with a potentially tricky opening day assignment against Leicester City, who have strengthened their squad with experience and talent and are determined to get off to a sound start on the back of winning the Championship.

But on the back of a campaign in which they were only just pipped by Manchester City in the race for the Barclays Premier League, Liverpool have lofty ambitions of their own – not least after Brendan Rodgers enjoyed success in the transfer window…

Here to stay: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has signed a new long-term contract at Anfield

So now begins the guessing game, a chance to play Fantasy Manager: who would be in your team if you could pick the starting line-up for the opening contest?

A lot of the names who Liverpool want are out there already. Adam Lallana, Southampton’s England international, is a prime target but negotiations will take time, as his club want £30million, given they owe 25 per cent of whatever transfer fee they receive to Bournemouth.

Bayern Munich’s Xherdan Shaqiri is an alternative to Lallana. A bid has been made for a 22-year-old who has found starts hard to come by at the Allianz Arena; another player with links to Munich, Emre Can, a highly-regarded 21-year-old who spent last season at Bayer Leverkusen, is coveted.

Liverpool, however, are not just looking to bolster their midfield. Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno, rated at £15million, is being closely monitored, along with Ryan Bertrand, the former England Under-21 international who has returned to Chelsea.

A central defender is also on the list, which is not a surprise given that Liverpool shipped 50 goals last season – the rickety back line is the reason Rodgers’ side were unable to become champions, a point proven by them conceding three goals on six occasions.

Dejan Lovren, the imposing Southampton central defender who enjoyed an outstanding first year in the Premier League, is admired by Liverpool, while Steven Caulker – a player with whom Rodgers worked when he was at Swansea – is also being considered.

There will, of course, be others but the identities will be known only by Rodgers and his inner circle. Clearly, this is going to be a busy couple of months for Rodgers, who has extended his own stay at Anfield after being given assurances he can compete at the top end of the transfer market, and his recruitment team, as the squad is not how he wants it to be.  

Rodgers’ ambition during the close season is to add players with hunger and drive. Liverpool’s ethos is to find players who are on the rise, with the appetite to prove themselves at the highest level, rather than going out to sign ‘ready-made’ stars.

‘The owners have shown me an unswerving commitment to what I want to do and that gives you confidence,’ Rodgers explained before Liverpool played Manchester United in March. Once you put your ideas in place and once the players start to crack it then we will have success.

‘Money can’t buy that. Teams spend a billion quid and it does not guarantee anything. We will be in the market for good and top players but there is more to it than that. It is about coaching and man management; dealing with people, having a great staff, finding a cause for the players to fight for.

‘All of that comes into it and that is something we have done in the period I have been here. We are starting to find momentum now and we hope it continues. The money is great and we will be in the market to compete but what is important is having a vision of how you want the club to progress.’

With that in mind, then, this is Sportmail’s guess at Liverpool’s line-up for the opening weekend (4-1-3-2):

Simon Mignolet

Glen Johnson, Martin Skrtel, Dejan Lovren, Jon Flanagan

Steven Gerrard

Jordan Henderson, Adam Lallana, Raheem Sterling

Daniel Sturridge, Luis Suarez
