A couple's dream getaway to celebrate their wedding anniversary turned into the 'holiday from hell' when a waiter’s attempt to flambe a fish for their family meal went disastrously wrong.

Parents Tony, 42, and Kirsty Barr, 35, had gone out for an evening meal to celebrate their sixth wedding anniversary with their three children while on a two-week break at the Turkish resort of Marmaris.

But the couple and two of their children ended up in hospital with severe burns after a bottle of alcohol held by their waiter exploded in their faces as he attempted to flambe their fish dinner.

Horrific injuries: Both Kirsty, left, and Tony Barr, right, suffered burns to their head, arms, neck and chest

Holiday hell: The incident at the La Luna restaurant happened just five days into their two week holiday

Mr Barr threw himself from a 20ft high window in a bid to stop the fire from spreading to others.

But the couple’s two-year-old baby daughter Rosie suffered burns after her pram caught fire.

Her 15-year-old sister Jessica, whose own arms and legs were on fire, managed to free Rosie and douse her with water from the restaurant sink.

Only Mr Barr's 15-year-old daughter Amy managed to escape the flames by diving for cover as the bottle exploded.

The rest of the family were all treated
for second-degree burns and third-degree injuries. 

Mr and Mrs Barr suffered burns to their head, arms, neck and chest and Mr Barr has a 
perforated eardrum.

Baby Rosie was left with burnt 
thighs.

Special occasion: The couple had taken their children out for a meal to celebrate their sixth wedding anniversary while on holiday in Turkey when a flambe fish dish went horribly wrong

Scarred: Tony and Kirsty Barr and their daughter Rosie, two, are now back at home in Great Harwood but still have scars from where they were burned

The flambe disaster at the La Luna 
restaurant happened five days into the trip but the family couldn't 
return home to Great Harwood until nearly five weeks later when Mr Barr 
was deemed fit to fly.

Because the
Barrs had no family insurance they were left with a £3,500 hospital 
bill.

Mr Barr, a chimney sweep in Hyndburn, described the experience as being worse than a holiday from hell.

He
said: 'It was unbelievably horrible as I had to jump from the 
restaurant balcony to stop flames spreading to my loved ones and my skin
was hanging off.

'My 
wife Kirsty’s body was covered in fire but thankfully waiters and other 
people helped her before an ambulance got us to hospital.'

In hospital: Tony Barr's injuries were so serious it took five weeks before he was deemed fit enough to fly home to Great Harwood

Nightmare holiday: The couple, who didn't have travel insurance, were left with a £3,500 hospital bill for the treatment of their injuries

Ordeal: Kirsty Barr, 35, suffered burns to her face as well as the upper part of her body

Mr Barr added that he was very proud of his brave step-daughter Jessica for her quick actions in helping her little sister Rosie.

He said: 'She is a hero as no one else could do anything to help Rosie.

'She would have died if it wasn’t for Jessica as when someone is on fire every second is like a minute.'

He added: 'I won’t be going on holiday abroad again. It was like the worst nightmare for all of us.

Devastated: The couple said the holiday was a 'complete nightmare' and they are still recovering from their ordeal

We are still trying to get over it. We are all not quite the same as we were before we left yet.'

Jessica
said she didn’t think twice about plucking Rosie from her pram despite 
her own agony and the carnage erupting around her.

She said: 'I didn’t really think 
because there was no time.

'Rosie was on fire and no one else could help 
her because my mum was on fire and so was Tony who had to jump off the 
balcony to stop flames spreading.

'When
the fire spread to the pram I ran to it. My legs were on fire too from 
the flamethrower effect that somehow happened.

'I tried to pat the flames
off Rosie and managed to unclip her.

'I
then ran inside and put her in the sink to cool her down and thankfully
she hadn’t passed out or died but she still needed to go to hospital.'

The couple say they are
now considering court action.
