George Osborne is up against it in his battle to block European plans to limit bonuses to a year's salary

George Osborne suffered a humiliating defeat in his bid to block a Europe-wide cap on bankers’ bonuses yesterday – after finding himself outvoted by 26 to one.

The Chancellor had vowed to block EU plans to prevent bankers being paid more than a year’s salary in bonuses in most cases.

Arriving in Brussels he declared: ‘I cannot support the proposal currently on the table.’

But hours later the Treasury conceded ‘a cap of some sort will happen’.

The climbdown came after the EU’s 26 other finance ministers made it clear they would not abandon the plan in the wake of the financial crisis.

Britain has no veto and Mr Osborne was forced to accept a face-saving concession from Germany, Spain and Italy to undertake ‘technical negotiations’ over how the cap will work, in the hope of reaching ‘consensus’.

The defeat is a significant blow to the UK, which had argued a bonus cap would have a disproportionate impact on the City of London.

It will raise fresh concerns about Britain’s ability to defend the City from a wave of financial regulations being plotted by Brussels.

Finance leaders fears the rules will drive away talent and restrict growth.

Employers’ organisation the CBI reacted with dismay, saying: ‘The proposals will damage the competitiveness of the EU’s financial services industry, hitting the UK particularly hard, at a time when growth should be the key priority.’ Downing Street last week said David Cameron had ‘real concerns’ about the proposals, while London Mayor Boris Johnson said the ‘deluded’ plan would simply drive top bankers overseas.

Yesterday Mr Osborne warned a cap on bonuses could result in banks pushing up salaries to top executives, which would be even harder to claw back in the event of failure.

The Chancellor fears capping bankers' bonuses will lead to an exodus from the City of London to other financial centres, like New York

‘Our concern is that it may have a perverse effect, it may undermine responsibility in the banking system rather than promote it,’ he said.

But Irish finance minister Michael Noonan said EU ministers were in no mood to give way to Britain over the issue.

Irish finance minister Michael Noonan warned Britain there is 'very little room' to take account of London's concerns

‘There is very little further that we can do for them (the British),’ he said. ‘There isn’t really any more room left.’

France’s finance minister Pierre Moscovici said Mr Osborne would have to ‘live with what is on the table’, adding: ‘These moral rules apply to everyone, even the City.’

Michel Barnier, the EU commissioner for the single market, said excessive bonuses had fuelled risky behaviour by bankers, with dire consequences for taxpayers.

‘Enough is enough. We’ve got to put a stop to that,’ he said.

The EU plans, which are now set to come into force next year, will limit bonuses to 100 per cent of a banker’s annual salary, or to 200 per cent if shareholders approve.

The Treasury last night insisted it still hoped to make the cap more ‘flexible’, but conceded it could not now be blocked altogether.

A spokesman said Britain would press for larger bonuses to be permitted on condition they were deferred for several years and/or paid in shares ‘so that they can be clawed back’.

÷The boss of scandal-hit UK bank Standard Chartered lashed out at the plans to cap bonuses – while pocketing a £2million payout.

Chief executive Peter Sands warned a crackdown would make its best staff an ‘easy target’ for rivals outside Europe.

Standard Chartered also claimed the £440million fine it was forced to pay for breaching sanctions against Iran, Burma. Libya and the Sudan was due to ‘clerical errors’.
