Manchester City now boast four of the Barclays Premier League’s top five goalscorers of 2014 after completing the signing of Wilfried Bony from Swansea for £25million.

The champions finally sealed the capture of the Ivory Coast striker on a four-and-a-half-year deal for a fee that will rise to £28m, depending on his success at the Etihad Stadium.

Bony will not join up with his new team-mates until next month because he is due to play for Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations but his arrival gives Manuel Pellegrini’s squad a very dangerous look as they try to chase down league leaders Chelsea in the second half of the season.

Bony himself was the Premier League top scorer for the last calendar year with 20 goals. He was followed by new team-mates Sergio Aguero and Yaya Toure — with 18 and 17 respectively.

Manchester United’s Wayne Rooney was next on 16 before City’s Edin Dzeko with 14.

Pellegrini has signed Bony, 26, for two reasons. Firstly, because of ongoing injury issues with Aguero, but also because there is a chance City’s current third-choice striker Stevan Jovetic may be sold to an Italian club before the end of the transfer window. 

‘It’s a great feeling for me, it’s a big honour to be here and it’s a great challenge,’ said Bony last night.

‘As a player it’s always good to be part of one of the biggest clubs in the world and it’s a good opportunity for me to be in that situation now — I’m really proud.

‘I felt excited to wait for this moment and now it’s come, it’s fantastic. I think it’s a great decision for me — Manchester City are in the Champions League.

Swansea later tweeted to say that the deal had not yet been finalised and would be announced in due course

If Bony's fee rises to £28million he will be the most expensive African player ever, ahead of Emmanuel Adebayor (£25million) 

‘You remember at the end of last season I said that if I want to move it will be to a team in the competition because it’s a great tournament that I really want to play in and one that I want to win.

‘It’s a motivation for me to give my maximum to be in that place. City are a big club with great players.’

Bony added that he believes playing alongside compatriot Toure will make him a better player. ‘I speak with Yaya every day on international duty and I think he will help me to become a better player and a more clinical striker,’ he said.  

Bony scored more Premier League goals in 2014 than any other player as he hit the net 20 times

Mmanchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini expects Bony to settle into the side quickly 

‘I’ll be playing with great players here at City and this is an opportunity for me to work hard and to take my chance.

‘The Premier League is a tough league — my power is to always be in the box and in the right position.I’m always working hard to be there to score the goals and to improve.’

Pellegrini added: ‘Bony is very difficult to mark because he is so strong. He is an intelligent footballer who has skill and power. His goals record has been excellent since he came to England. 

'He adapted very quickly to the game here and he will settle in at City quickly. He will be a very good addition to our squad. We now have four top-class strikers.’
