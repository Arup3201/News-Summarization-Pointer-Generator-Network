The Royal Bank of Scotland was yesterday branded ‘shocking’ after effectively admitting some of its lending practices had driven small firms to the wall.

The state-backed bank conceded it had ‘over corrected’ its policy – as a damning report revealed its zeal to reduce risky loans forced previously solvent companies out of business.

RBS, which is 82 per cent taxpayer owned, has engaged lawyers Clifford Chance to investigate claims that it forced companies into default in order to seize their properties.

The allegations are made in a study by businessman Lawrence Tomlinson,  commissioned by the Government.

Under-fire: The state-backed bank conceded it had ¿over corrected¿ its policy on lending to small business

On the same day, it also emerged that the bank’s lending to small businesses has collapsed by £17billion since it was rescued by the taxpayer in 2008.

At its peak, RBS lent £55billion to small firms. Now, it is £38billion, according to a report by Sir Andrew Large, former Bank of England deputy governor.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said he was ‘appalled’ by Mr Tomlinson’s study while Chancellor George Osborne described the claims as ‘shocking’.

Sir Andrew’s report also revealed a string of embarrassing facts about the bank, including:* Six in ten loan applications to RBS are ‘screened out’ even before customers formally request a loan, more than in the rest of the industry;* Of those who submit an application, just a third are successful;* The majority of RBS managers admit they only submit an application if they are ‘100 per cent sure’ it will be approved by bosses. They are not incentivised to lend to small firms.

Probe: Businessman Lawrence Tomlinson compiled a damning report on the bank's activities

The bank’s recently appointed boss, Ross McEwan, said it had ‘over corrected’ since its days of reckless lending. In a letter to Sir Andrew, he said: ‘In many cases, the pendulum of risk aversion has swung too hard to one side.’

Meanwhile, Mr Tomlinson concluded: ‘The findings of the report do clearly show heavy-handed, profiteering and abhorrent behaviour of some of the banks.

‘The evidence received does . . . indicate a far darker situation than just the existence of conditions which could lead to the mistreatment of businesses.

‘It is undeniable that some of the banks, RBS in particular, are harming their customers.’

The two reports come three years after the Mail launched its Make The Banks Lend campaign in July 2010 to highlight the plight of small firms. At the time, Lord King, then Bank of England governor, discussed the ‘heartbreaking’ way in which banks treated small firms.

Yesterday Liberal Democrat Lord Oakeshott said the report was ‘a damning indictment of RBS’s failure to lend’.

He said: ‘Britain’s small businesses don’t need another inquiry. They need our Government-backed bank and the Funding for Lending scheme to focus on real growth and jobs, not forcing up house prices to ever less affordable peaks.’

Phil Orford, of the Forum of Private Business, said banks’ ethics ‘continue to astound’. He said Mr Tomlinson’s claims of ‘artificially distressing businesses to gain more fees and assets before making them insolvent would be contemptible, if proven true’.

Simon Walker, of business network the Institute of Directors, said: ‘Economic recovery will be secured by small and medium sized firms who have the confidence to take on new staff, expand their business and invest in the future.

‘We are deeply concerned by reports RBS, a state-owned bank, is behaving in a way that appears to put their short-term objectives over the interests of Britain’s small businesses.’

Small and medium-sized firms employ 60 per cent of Britain’s private sector workforce.

Sir Andrew’s review looked at 
relationship managers and credit officers at the bank – the people 
responsible for lending decisions.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said he was ‘appalled’ by Mr Tomlinson’s study while Chancellor George Osborne described the claims as ‘shocking’

He found that after the crisis, bonuses became less directly linked to the number of loans agreed, while there were sanctions imposed for approving applications that went on to be rejected.

The changes made staff less likely to give businesses a chance, even when it was a fair risk, he said.The review adds that a complex and flawed credit process is also to blame for the low number of loans taken up by SMEs. Many who were approved refused the loans because they were not offered the terms they wanted.

Sir Andrew said three sources had spoken about ‘extreme allegations’ of mistreatment.

Mr McEwan pledged to improve SME lending by writing to thousands of firms about loans, starting a website on the lending process, promising to make most decisions in five days, training staff and improving the appeals process.

Chris Richardson says his life was ‘utterly devastated’ when RBS pulled funding from his hotel business 11 days before it was due to open.

The father of three said the stress of his firm’s collapse took its toll on his wife Karen, who died from lung cancer in May.

‘Her last words to me were “Promise me you will never give up this fight”. So that’s why I’m taking legal action now - they just can’t get away with this.’

‘The stress of our finances certainly contributed to her death and I don’t know how I’ll ever recover from that.’

Mr Richardson, 48, began refurbishing the Coniston hotel in Sittingbourne, Kent, in 2008 with a £5.4million loan from NatWest, which is owned by RBS.

With just £120,000 of work left to do on its car park, he had hired staff and fully stocked his 79-bedroom luxury hotel.

But within the space of a week, he said his business, which had been valued at £7.7million in 2010, had been snuffed out when NatWest said they would no longer support him.

‘Despite the fact we had only drawn £4.2million of our loan, we were told we had run out of money and they wouldn’t back us any more.

All of a sudden, we were forced to go into administration because they got someone else in to value the business at £2.5million - a third of what Savills [the property firm] said it was worth just four months before.’

Mr Richardson is now working part-time as a labourer to support daughters Jessica, 13, Louise, 16, and 19-year-old Maxine.

His case is due to appear in the High Court next June.

He said: ‘My girls are really struggling. They’re angry and can’t believe the grief we have been put through. And on top of everything, now their mum isn’t here for them.’
