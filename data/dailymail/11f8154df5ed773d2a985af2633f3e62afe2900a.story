Kate Moss has strutted her stuff on every catwalk going, but now it looks like she's passing the baton to her half-sister Lottie.

Lottie Moss, 17, proved her worth as a fledgling model as she made her runway debut at Paris fashion week on Monday in the Sonia Rykiel autumn/winter 15 show.

The young starlet showcased a velvet playsuit and ankle boots as she stomped down the runway behind fellow fashion royalty, Georgia May and Lizzy Jagger.

The show, which took place in the brand's Saint-Germain-des-Prés store, was the brainchild of artistic director, Julie de Libran, who joined the brand just under a year ago from Louis Vuitton. 

While this was Lottie's first runway show, she hasn't been short of high fashion campaigns since launching her modelling career. 

Lottie's first assignment was for a high-fashion editorial spread in the February issue of Dazed and Confused, the magazine co-founded by Jefferson Hack, Kate's ex-boyfriend and father of her daughter Lila Grace. 

She's starred on the glossy pages of i-D and Teen Vogue magazines, bagged a Red Valentino campaign and modelled in a Beats by Dr. Dre advert.

In July, she posed for Calvin Klein Jeans, 21 years after Kate did her first campaign with the brand.

Lottie, based in London, is the daughter of Kate's father and his second wife Inger, and - like her sister - is signed to Storm Model Management.

Standing at only 5ft 5in, Lottie is by far the shortest model on Storm's books and is a full two inches shorter even than Kate, who is also uncharacteristically diminutive for a model.

The porcelain-featured teen signed with Storm when she was only 13 - a year younger than Kate was when she was discovered at New York's JFK airport in 1988 aged 14.
