Nothing will give Arsenal fans more pleasure than knowing that one of their own helped humiliate Manchester United on Tuesday night as MK Dons hammered Louis van Gaal's side 4-0.

Benik Afobe is the second Gunners striker this year to down a United side while on loan at another club after Joel Campbell netted against the Reds for Olympiacos in a 2-0 win for the Greek side. 

But, with Olivier Giroud struggling with a foot injury and Arsenal struggling for options up front, Gunners fans will be left wondering why Arsene Wenger cannot select Afobe in the first-team right now.

Brace: Arsenal loanee Benik Afobe netted twice for MK Dons during their 4-0 victory over Manchester United

Celebration: Afobe showed his pace, power and strength during the Capital One Cup tie on Tuesday evening

Afobe - a 21-year-old striker who is enjoying his sixth loan spell in four years - bagged a brace for the Dons to wrap up a famous win for the League One side.

The forward now has three goals in six games this season.

He showed his pace, power and strength as he tormented United's young defence and opportunistically capitalised on two mistakes to score twice.

For the first goal, Afobe ran in behind the United defence and took a wonderful through-ball in his stride before coolly slotting past David de Gea.

His second strike was perhaps even more impressive. After James Reece misjudged a long ball down the right-hand side, Afobe ran in behind him, nicked the ball and held off the challenges of three players as he advanced into the box and fired home.

Cool: Afobe slots home his first, and MK Dons' third, after collecting an excellent through-ball

Opportunism: Afobe nicks in behind the United defence before beating three defenders to score his second

Born in Kent, Afobe was picked up by Arsenal's academy at the age of just six.

He was signed professionally in 2010 and has since spent time on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, Huddersfield Town, Reading, Bolton and Millwall.

His career return of 15 goals in 71 games is not overly impressive, but the potential he showed against United means Wenger must be contemplating why he allowed to let him leave on a season-long loan.

Having represented England from U16 through to U21 level - and having scored once already for the oldest of those sides - he has shown he can rise to the big occasion.

But even if Arsenal fans do not see Afobe play at the Emirates for the remainder of this season, they will laud him as a hero after downing United in such devastating fashion. 

Finish: Afobe raced into the box, beating three men on the way, before unleashing an unstoppable shot
