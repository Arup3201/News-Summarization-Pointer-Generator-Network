A baby girl is in critical condition after miraculously surviving a 50ft fall down a rubbish chute.

Police believe she plummeted from the 
fifth floor of a block of flats down the chute, which leads to a 
refuse collection area.

The newborn, who had been reported 
missing, was found in a bin to the rear of the building in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, at 6.30pm on Saturday.

A 24-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.

Theory: Detectives believe the baby may have fallen 50ft from the fifth floor of this block of flats in Wolverhampton, West Midlands

Inquiry: Police have begun an attempted murder investigation after the newborn girl was found in a bin behind the flats

The young girl was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital with serious injuries.

Police have also arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of assisting an offender.

Detective Inspector John Smith, of West Midlands Police's Public Protection Unit, said: 'We are making a number of enquiries to establish how this young baby has come to sustain her injuries, and how she came to be found in the refuse area of the flats.'

Scene: Police found the baby in a bin in a refuse collection area at the rear of the building after a girl was reported missing

Out of bounds: Police sealed off large areas of the block of flats as they investigated the case

'We urge anyone who has information to help our investigation to come forward at the earliest opportunity.'

A police officer at the scene said: 'I can tell you that the child is thought to have fallen from the fifth floor.

'That's all I can tell you at the moment.'

He said: 'The police came and asked me if there had been any commotion between 16.30 and 19.00 on Saturday night.

'They have had a non-stop presence. All the rubbish chutes are still blocked up and detectives have been back and forth.'

Constant presence: Residents said police officers had been at the building ever since the girl was found

Fact finding: A police officer stands at an entrance to the block of flats where the baby girl was found in a bin with serious injuries

Nora Donnelly, 49, said: 'On Saturday night there were about five police cars and two ambulances at the front door.

'You could hear a child crying in the back of one of the ambulances.

Emergency: Police were called to the block of flats in Boscobel Crescent, Wolverhampton, on Saturday evening

'It's strange because I don't remember seeing anyone pregnant or carrying a young child around.

'And I haven't noticed any police activity in any of the flats so there's a chance they might not have lived here.

'It's a real shock to have something like that happen around here, I don't know who could do that to a baby.

'I just hope she's going to be all right.'

The block of flats is a short distance from Wolverhampton Wanderers football club's Molineux stadium.

A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said: 'Police were called to a flat on Boscobel Crescent in Wolverhampton at around 6.30pm on Saturday, September 8 to a report of a missing child.

'A very young baby was subsequently found nearby in the refuse collection area with serious injuries.

'She was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital where she currently remains in a critical condition.

'Police are investigating how the child came to be in the refuse area and are conducting enquiries around the tower block this morning.'
