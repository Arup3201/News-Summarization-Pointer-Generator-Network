Former BBC director-general Mark Thompson is at the centre of a new cronyism row following the release of a bombshell document about the ‘Crowngate’ affair.

The secret internal briefing note, written in the wake of a £500,000 payoff to ex-BBC1 controller Peter Fincham, last night prompted one Tory MP to accuse Mr Thompson of giving potentially misleading evidence to a Commons committee.

The document, marked ‘strictly private and confidential’, details the background to Mr Fincham’s dismissal, which came after he inaccurately stated that the Queen had walked out of a photoshoot featured in a Royal documentary ‘in a huff’.

It later emerged that a promotional trailer for the programme had been misleadingly edited.

Mr Fincham agreed to leave in the wake of the 2007 row – but still walked away with a half-million pound ‘golden goodbye’.

When Mr Thompson appeared before the Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC) in September, he was asked if such ‘eye-watering’ payoffs were part of a ‘culture of extravagance’ at the BBC.

Asked about the specific payment to Mr Fincham, Mr Thompson said he had left as part of a ‘consensual termination’, adding: ‘We were going through a difficult negotiation, a lawyer-to-lawyer negotiation.’

However, the newly released document suggests that Mr Thompson played a much more direct role in setting the size of the payoff.

The briefing – prepared earlier this year for the current BBC director-general Lord Hall – states: ‘There is no documented approval for the payment; it is understood that Mark Thompson gave verbal instructions to the BBC legal team.’

The note goes on to say: ‘The lawyer who constructed the compromise agreement is no longer with the BBC; however, a team member recalls the lawyer saying that Mark Thompson gave verbal instructions to her as she drafted the compromise agreement.’

The document concludes: ‘It is essential that this note is kept strictly confidential and is not shared with anyone.’

Tory MP Rob Wilson, who has waged a long campaign to force the BBC to release the document under Freedom of Information rules, has written to the Labour chairman of the PAC to question Mr Thompson’s  evidence to the committee.

‘I would like to draw your attention to the possibility that the PAC was potentially misled,’ he writes.

‘The BBC’s internal account paints a very different picture to that presented to your committee by Mr Thompson.

Far from the outcome of the payoff being essentially the result of negotiations between  lawyers which the BBC was obliged to accept, the lawyer who drafted the compromise agreement which included the payoff was in fact taking her instructions directly from Mr Thompson himself.’

Mr Wilson added that this showed ‘the practice of granting payoffs at the top of the BBC in recent years owed more to a culture of cronyism than standards of good practice’, and that ‘Mr Thompson’s suggested behaviour was inappropriate’.

A spokesman for Mr Thompson did not return calls last night.

Top BBC executives are spending tens of thousands of pounds  of licence fee-payers’ money  on ‘champagne and seabass’  meals with each other at  exclusive restaurants.

The lunches and dinners – described in BBC accounts as ‘editorial meetings’ – contributed  to a total inter-executive wining and dining bill of more than  £30,000 last year.

One £155,000-a-year executive has managed to notch up a personal dining tally of more than £11,000 over the past four years.

According to documents and receipts released by the BBC, there were 269 claims for executives dining with each other last year, which amounts to more than one for every working day. Each claim cost more than £100 on average.

The biggest claimant was  David Holdsworth, the controller of English regions, who has spent £11,050 on wining and dining since 2010.

The second most lavish spender was Peter Johnston, the £152,000-a-year director of BBC Northern Ireland, who spent £5,185, while Roger Wright, the £227,000-a-year controller of Radio 3, spent £4,758.

Receipts from some of these ‘meetings’ show how convivial they can be. Gwyneth Williams, the £183,000-a-year controller of Radio 4, enjoyed glasses of Champagne Billecart-Salmon, chablis and seabass at an ‘editorial/leaving lunch’ in May 2012 with Mary Kalemkerian, the former head of programming for Radio 4.

Ben Gale, the former head of Bristol Factual, billed £79.45 for a ‘programme development meeting’ at a Bristol restaurant which included a 31-day dry-aged fillet steak – served on a lava rock heated to 500F – costing more than £28 with a sauce.

And another meeting, between Ken MacQuarrie and Rhodri Talfan-Davies, the heads of BBC Scotland and Wales, was held at the Royal Dragon in Soho, Central London, where they  enjoyed the Peking set dinner and six Asahi beers.

The executives dined out at the restaurants even though they can choose from 166 meeting rooms at New Broadcasting House.

Figures show that since 2010, the ‘internal hospitality’ spend by top executives has risen from £19,181 to £30,350 –  an average of £1,017 a year for those who submitted claims.

The executives also received another perk: the BBC spent a total of £7.8 million on paying tax bills incurred by employees on perks such as taxis and meals.

Last night, a BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC employs 20,000 people and this expenditure, released under our disclosure rules, equates to £1.50 per person, per year.

‘Like many other UK businesses, the BBC pays tax on certain taxable benefits, such as the cost  of ensuring staff can travel home safely late at night.’
