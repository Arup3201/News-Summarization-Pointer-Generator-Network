Oregon's 2014 Teacher of the Year claims he has been placed on paid administrative leave because he used his title as a platform to speak publicly about being gay. 

Brett Bingham, who teaches special education, has filed multiple complaints against the Multnomah Education Service District for allegedly harassing and discriminating against the educator because of his sexual orientation. 

Bingham found out he was being placed on leave during a field trip with his students on Friday. 

Oregon's 2014 Teacher of the Year Brett Bingham claims he has been placed on paid adminsitrative leave because he used his title as a platform to speak publicly about being gay 

He said it was his lawyer, who received a letter from the district, who broke the news.

'I returned to school and nobody spoke to me,' he told Fox 12.  

 'At 3.30 I just packed up my favorite plants and put a box of my stuff together that I was afraid would be thrown away and I left.' 

According to a complaint Bingham filed with the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries Civil Rights Division, problems with the district began shortly after he was named the state's  teacher of the year in October 2013.

Bingham claims one such incident occurred after he was asked about his sexual orientation while giving a speech. The teacher said his department head left the event immediately and without saying anything to Bingham. 

He then claims she told him he could not speak about being gay or 'someone is going to shoot you in the head'.   

Bingham then alleged that the district placed him under a 'gag order' in April and told him he could not publicly speak or write unless his comments were approved. 

The teacher said he then filed a grievance with his union, which stated that he felt he was receiving 'disparate treatment' because of his sexual orientation.

Bingham claims the following retaliation was swift. 

He said he was told that he now had to receive district approval before he could attend any teacher of the year events and was denied from appearing at two Gay Straight Student Alliance events, as well as working with a local LGBTQ community center.

Bingham said management also began ordering him to pick up coffee and take out their garbage, 'menial tasks' he claims he was not asked to perform 'prior to the greater public awareness of my sexual orientation'.  

Relations between Bingham and the district worsened when school officials said the teacher would lose his job if he attended a gala for the National Education Association's Foundation, who were presenting him with an award, in Washington, D.C., he claims.

District Superintendent Barbara Jorgensen allegedly told Bingham he would not be granted leave to attend any events related to teacher of the year, claiming he had too many school absences.

In a tweet Bingham claimed district officials told him they would consider letting him 'attend the NEA awards' if he recalled his state and federal complaints. 

Bingham was eventually allowed to attend the event after the Oregon Education Association found a clause in his contract that protected his job, according to OregonLive. 

Jorgensen was removed from the Superintendent position last week but the district claimed Bingham's complaints were not a factor, according to Fox 12.

But Bingham believes nothing has changed and that there are other officials in the district who want to see him fired. 

'There's no other explanation because I've never been in trouble,' he said. 'I have an excellent reputation.' 

MESD spokeswoman Laura Conroy declined to elaborate the district's reason for putting Bingham on paid administrative leave.
