A man who found himself unlucky in love decided to launch a unique dating night where singletons woo their potential matches by giving presentations.

Rahul Saggar, from Brooklyn, New York, was inspired to start Presentation Date Night when a woman unexpectedly showed interest in him after hearing a PowerPoint presentation he gave at work.

Now, Mr Saggar hosts events in his basement where guests drink complimentary alcohol and share cooking demonstrations, poetry readings and PowerPoint shows in the hopes that their presentations will lure mates.

Mr Saggar explained that the two events he has hosted so far were successful because they introduced a whole new way of courting potential love interests.

He told DNAInfo: 'You're in someone's place that's cozy 
and everyone is there for the same reason. There's a certain degree of humility, since you
 know you're there presenting yourself.'

Some of his guests have included a woman who made lemonade, a man who read aloud a poem about his likes and dislikes and a singer who performed with two drag queen backup dancers.

And Mr Saggar himself, a documentary filmmaker, kicks off each session by reading a collection of rejection letters he's received from potential employers and movie submissions.

'I'd go to Rahul's even if I weren't
 single - I like anything that 
pulls New Yorkers out of their shells'

Christopher Xavier, a musician and illustrator who attended one of the events, said of the night: 'The variety of acts was amazing.'

Explaining that he was inspired to attend because he just got out of a long-term relationship, Mr Xavier added: 'I'd go to Rahul's show even if I weren't single or looking, because I like odd events and I like anything that pulls New Yorkers out of their shells.'

At the next event on Thursday, December 19, Mr Xavier plans to present a video he has made called Don't Look at Girls, which combines drawings and songs about the dangers of romance.

Innovative concept: 'You're in someone's place that's cozy and everyone is there for the same reason,' explains Mr Saggar (pictured). There's a certain degree of humility, since you know you're there presenting yourself'

'I like the mystery of the show, too, as there are no rules or guidelines on how you'd sell yourself to the audience,' he said. 'No two presenters [are] remotely alike.'

'Everyone's there for the same reason, and there's a degree of humility, since you
 know you're there presenting yourself'

Mr Saggar launched the night with the intention of helping singletons find romance, but it seems the event has taken on a life of its own.

Indeed, he described one night during which the dating event turned into a kind of group therapy session after one woman presented her online dating profile and started talking about how men 'have the power' in dating.

'And then men there said that the women have power,' said Mr Saggar. 'It became like a group therapy session... [The presentations] definitely become a dialogue.'
