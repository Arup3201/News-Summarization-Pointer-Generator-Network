Early mammals alive when dinosaurs roamed the Earth were picky eaters, new research suggests.

Analysis of tiny fossil mammals from South Wales is shedding new light on the function and diets of our earliest ancestors.

For many people, mere mention of the word Jurassic conjures up images of huge dinosaurs chomping their way through lush vegetation - and each other.

Analyses of fossilised mammals discovered in South Wales are shedding light on the creatures’ diets. The teeth of Morganucodon and Kuehneotherium (pictured left and right)  hunted their prey on the  island they shared, which is now Glamorgan, South Wales, and are different insects

However, 
mammals and their immediate ancestors were also around in the Jurassic 
period, from 201 to 145 million years ago, albeit as rather less 
spectacular creatures.

The
 shrew-sized, early Jurassic mammals were thought to have been confined 
to the ecological margins, eating whatever insects they could find.

However,
 this was also the time when new mammal characteristics - such as better
 hearing and teeth capable of precise chewing - were developing.

Palaeontologists from the Universities of Bristol and Leicester studied shrew-sized early Jurassic mammals, which were originally thought to have eaten any insects that they could find.

By studying their teeth, they found that two of the earliest mammals, Morganucodon and Kuehneotherium, were not generalised insectivores but had already evolved specialised diets, feeding on distinct types of insects.

The experts were interested in whether competition was driving the evolution of features such as better hearing and teeth capable of precise chewing.

So, they studied the fossils of Morganucodon and Kuehneotherium found in Glamorgan, South Wales which 200 million years ago consisted of a series of small islands in a shallow continental sea. 

Mammals scurried alongside the dinosaurs between 201 and 145 million years ago. A footprint made by a theropod in what is now the south coast of Wales is pictured. Unlike with some dinosaur fossils, none of the mammal fossils have the sort of exceptional preservation that includes stomach contents to infer diet

Footprints made by dinosaurs 200 million years ago have been vandalised by amateur fossil hunters in Wales.

The tracks were among the best examples anywhere in the world and their precise location has largely remained a secret.

But blundering fossil hunters have damaged the footprints by filling one with plaster of Paris and hammering it in a bid to remove their plaster cast.

They also lit fires on the rock shelf where the tracks have laid undisturbed since Jurassic times.

An investigation has been launched to assess the damage and track down the culprits.

Mr Langford discovered the damage while taking a party of 10 students to the site at Bendrick Rock, between Barry and Sully, on the South Wales coast.

The footprints are believed to have been left by three-toed meat-eating theropod dinosaurs, that walked on their hind legs.

Some wider four-toed footprints are believed to belong to a plant eating dinosaur which would have walked on all fours.

The footprints were made by some of the earliest dinosaurs in the world and it is possible that ancestral crocodile-like replies walked among them.

At the time, the site lay in the arid north belt of the equator and South Wales was a hot desert. 

Lead author, Dr Pamela Gill of the University of Bristol explained: ‘None of the fossils of the earliest mammals have the sort of exceptional preservation that includes stomach contents to infer diet.

'Instead we used a range of new techniques which we applied to our fossil finds of broken jaws and isolated teeth.

‘Our results confirm that the diversification of mammalian species at the time was linked with differences in diet and ecology.’

The team studied X-rays and CT scans to reveal the internal anatomy of the creatures’ tiny jaws, which are only 2cm in length.

As the jaws are in many pieces, the scans were 'stitched together' to make a complete digital reconstruction.

Finite element modelling – a technique used to design hip joints and bridges - was used to analyse the strength of the animals’ jaws, according to the study published in the journal Nature.

The technique showed that Kuehneotherium and Morganucodon had very different abilities for catching and chewing prey.

The teeth of Morganucodon and Kuehneotherium had different patterns of microscopic pits and scratches, known as 'microwear'.

This indicated they were eating different things with Morganucodon favouring harder, crunchier food items such as beetles while Kuehneotherium selected softer foods such as scorpion flies which were common at the time.

Professor Mark Purnell of the University of Leicester said: ‘This is the first time that tooth wear patterns have been used to analyse the diet of mammals this old. 

‘That their tooth wear compares so closely to bats that specialise on different kinds of insects gives us really strong evidence that these early mammals were not generalists when it came to diet, but were quite definite in their food choices.’ 

Team leader, Professor Emily Rayfield from the University of Bristol added: ‘This study is important as it shows for the first time that the features that make us unique as mammals, such as having only one set of replacement teeth and a specialised jaw joint and hearing apparatus, were associated with the very earliest mammals beginning to specialise their teeth and jaws to eat different things.’
