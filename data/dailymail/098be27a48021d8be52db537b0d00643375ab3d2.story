The U.S. Coast Guard is searching for a cruise ship cook who went overboard in the Caribbean Sea.

Officials say Inyoman Bagiada, 45, of Indonesia fell overboard early Wednesday near the Yucatan Channel. Bagiada was a cook aboard the Celebrity Constellation.

According to the Coast Guard, the cruise did not report Bagiada missing until eight hours after he fell overboard.

The cruise line says a pair of shoes were found next to a deck railing, and a review of closed-circuit camera footage showed ‘a person going overboard.’

Officials say the ship’s location at the time the person went overboard was then reported to the Coast Guard.

The vessel was returning from Cozumel, Mexico, to Port Everglades after a five-day cruise. It resumed its journey once the Coast Guard launched a rescue cutter and an HC-130 maritime helicopter to look for the missing man, according to NBC News.

The incident took place at around 2.30am in the area of the Yucatan Channel about 20 miles off Cuba. But it was not until about 10.30am that Bagiada was reported missing.

The cook’s disappearance marks the sixth such incident in the last five weeks, the maritime law blog Cruise Law News reported.

Celebrity and its sister company Royal Caribbean have lost four people overboard over the past couple of months.

Most recently, a 65-year-old Canadian passenger went missing New Year's Day from Independence of the Seas, which sailed to the Cayman Islands.

The Constellation, dubbed ‘Connie’, is a 965-foot ship with the capacity to house more than 2,100 passengers that made its debut in 2002 as the fourth and final vessel in Celebrity’s Millennium line.

In a glowing review of Constellation posted on the popular site CruiseCritic, editor Dan Askin described ‘Connie’ as a popular yet quirky ship that has developed quite the following among well-off seafaring enthusiasts in their 40s.  

The ‘luxury-lite’ boat boasts a grand atrium, marble finishings, numerous restaurants dishing out sumptuous meals with white-glove service and a smattering of eccentric artworks.

Askin, who gave the ship four and a half out of five stars, wrote that last April, Constellation underwent a thorough makeover, emerging from the drydock after 19 days with 66 additional cabins, Apple workstations, lounges, shops and an improved basketball court.
