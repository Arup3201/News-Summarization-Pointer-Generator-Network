Luke Shaw has described his first weeks at Manchester United as 'crazy' ahead of his home debut against Valencia on Tuesday.

The 19-year-old left-back joined the Red Devils in a £30million deal from Southampton earlier this summer having made his World Cup debut for England in Brazil.

'It's been a crazy few weeks,' Shaw told reporters.

'I got back from the World Cup and came up here to get everything sorted with the medical.

'I’d heard a lot of things about how crazy it was on tour and I witnessed that.

'Until you have gone out to America, you don’t know what it’s like.

Having played on the Red Devils unbeaten tour of America, Shaw is relishing the chance to play at Old Trafford and said: 'As a kid, it’s a dream to play at Old Trafford and it’s one of the biggest arenas in the world.

'To know it’s going to be my home ground is something special. I can’t wait to get my first touch on the pitch, just to relish it.'

Shaw will be hoping to feature as United open their Premier League campaign against Swansea on Saturday.
