Mike Ditka, who coached the Chicago Bears from 1982 to 1992, has said that if he had son now he would not wish for the boy to play football.

Ditka made the remarks in a 'Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel' report on the 1985 Bears team, which won the 1986 Super Bowl against the New England Patriots. A preview of the report appeared online Friday and was picked up by media outlets. 

'If you had an 8-year-old kid now, would you tell him you wanted him to play football?' Ditka asked host Bryant Gumbel.

'I wouldn't. Would you?' Gumbel asked.

'No, nope,' Ditka said in the HBO Sports program. 'That's sad. I wouldn't. My whole life was football. I think the risk is worse than the reward. I really do.'

'Implement something for the former players who played this game, and made this game what it is today. That's what I would say,' Ditka said earlier in the interview.

He added 'To the [NFL] commissioner, to the [team] owners, you got a - you got an obligation and a responsibility to those guys, cause you wouldn't have a damn job right now if it wasn't for those guys.'

Ditka - who also played for the Bears from 1961 to 1966 - told Gumbel 'They don't do it because they don't think they have to, I guess. They don't think they owe anybody anything.'

Both Bears quarterback Jim McMahon as well as Super Bowl MVP winner and defensive end Richard Dent appeared in the 'Real Sports' report and spoke about their health problems.

McMahon has been diagnosed with early onset dementia, the report revealed. McMahon also told Gumbel that he lies in his bed for long periods of time looking up at the ceiling fan and has memory loss.

'The forgetfulness,' McMahon said. 'You know, I'd leave the bedroom, tell [my girlfriend Laurie] I was going to the store to get a dip or something, and she'd come in here a half hour later and I'm still standing there wondering what I was going to do.

'And she says "You were going to go to the store." And I said "Oh okay." I said "I'll go to the store" and then I'll go to the store and then I'll have to call her and say "I don't know how to get back home."'

Dent spoke about drugs given to him by the team so he could continue playing despite being in pain.

'You passing out alcohol on the plane coming home, and you passing out meds, too,' he told Gumbel.

'A person needed consent on what I'm taking, how much I'm taking, and what's the consequences to it,' Dent said. 'I was hell then, but now, you know, I'm very damaged goods.'

The full report on the 1985 Chicago Bears is scheduled to air January 20 at 10pm on HBO.
