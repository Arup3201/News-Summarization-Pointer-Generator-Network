The act of sex with a new person can often be an embarrassing experience.

But it appears carrying out the motions in a brightly lit room full of people, cameras and sound equipment with a man shouting directions is mortifying.

A new video has surfaced on-line that shows a behind-the-scenes look at what it's like for actors when they have to pretend to make love for a part on a movie. 

The two-minute clip shows Brooklyn Decker and Patrick Wilson acting out a sex scene for a film that they co-starred in called Stretch, with a running commentary from the director Joe Carnahan throughout.

Brooklyn Decker and Patrick Wilson are seen joking around in a moment in between takes for a sex scene on a film they co-starred in called Stretch 

A member of the make-up team is on hand in between takes to spray fake sweat onto Patrick Wilson 

The scene opens with Patrick lying naked on top of Brooklyn, with the noise of several crew members busy at work in the background

Shortly after Joe tells the actors to 'Knock a couple of these [sex scenes] out,' Patrick asks Brooklyn if she feels okay. 

The actress replies that everything is fine and that she was just moving 'it', referring to Patrick's private parts. 

Then the volume on a track by James Brown is turned up and  the sex scene starts, with Joe telling the actors that he is going to: 'Let Big James show you the rhythm, ready and action!’

Brooklyn and Patrick oblige with 20 seconds of simulating sex before Patrick pauses deadpan and says, ‘And then I’m out.’

The director cuts in laughing and says, ‘Nice, that was great! All right guys, do another one like that and we’ve got it, I swear to God.’

Patrick asks, ‘Was that enough f***ing?' And director replies, ‘That was a lot of f***ing, great f***ing!’ While Brooklyn laughs. 

The actors are then sprayed with fake sweat before another member of the crew gives them directions. 

Although they are being watched by several members of the crew, Patrick manages to share a joke with Brooklyn

The director then says to Brooklyn, ‘Babe, when you’re looking at him, really engage with him, like you don’t want to let his eyes go. And then give him a little back pat, as if to say, “You did so great.”’

Referring to his faked climax, Patrick then asks, ‘Do you like no words or do you think Stretch is a guy who tells you what he’s going to do?’

The director responds, ‘Oh absolutely, I think he definitely does.’

The clip ends with Joe telling Brooklyn, 'And then babe you should go, “Good, good, good, yes, come, come, come.”’

Several high-profile actors have spoken out in the past about the awkwardness of filming Hollywood sex scenes.

Keira Knightley claims her intimate moments opposite James McAvoy in the 2007 film Attonement were some of her most cringe-worthy because they were good friends outside of work. 

She said: 'There's a scene where we're having sex up against a book shelf as you do. 

'And it's with the lovely James McAvoy who's a friend, and it's always really awkward because he's a friend.

'And we're in the middle of it and suddenly this voice shouts, 'Keira! W*** him off!' 

Meanwhile, Samuel L. Jackson has revealed that having to act out sex scenes usually involves an audience of several men on set. 

He said: 'People don't know when they're looking at the film that there's 15 guys standing around and a guy with a sandwich who's shouting, "Faster!'" 

'It's kind of tough for us too, because you come into a room and say, "Okay, so where can I touch you? Where can I not touch you? I want to apologise now for getting excited.'"
