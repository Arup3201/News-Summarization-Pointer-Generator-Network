Same sex couples are able to have their marriages legally recognised for the first time in New South Wales. 

Many Australian couples who have got married in places like New Zealand because gay marriage is still not legal in Australia. 

Alex Greenwich, independent member for Sydney, campaigned for the change in the law and was supported by the NSW government, and now marriages performed overseas have been legalised under the Federal Marriage Act and has been recognised by the NSW Relationships Register.

The new law was passed by the NSW Federal government yesterday. 

Mr Greenwich said: 'Under these changes, same sex couples who marry overseas will be able to reflect their marital status on relevant forms and will no longer have to declare that they are not married. 

'The eligibility section of the guide for couples will also be updated to clarify that same sex couples who marry overseas are eligible to register their relationship.'

Australian same sex couples have so far been forced to get married overseas

'This change acknowledges that a growing number of NSW citizens must travel overseas to marry the person they love, while waiting for the Federal Government to legislate for marriage equality'

'The inaction of federal governments, past and present, on marriage equality remains an embarrassing blight on our nation's reputation for fairness, freedom and equality.'

'Fortunately the NSW Relationship Register will now ensure these marriages receive a level of protection and recognition in NSW, and I thank the Attorney-General for working with me towards this outcome.'  

Marriage equality advocates at the Australian Marriage Equality have welcomed changes to the NSW Relationships Register to recognise same-sex couples married overseas.

Ivan Hinton-Teoh, acting director of Australian Marriage Equality, added: 'Every year Australians are travelling to a growing number of countries that recognise the value of building an inclusive society, countries that have already achieved marriage equality.'

'In the absence of federal reform, NSW now provides legal recognition for these overseas marriages and, in doing so, has highlighted the importance of this reform for all Australians.'

'We call on the Federal Government to recognise the commitments that are made by Australians overseas. As we legally recognise foreign commercial contracts it should go without saying that we should also recognise these enduring, lifelong commitments.'

Thousands of Australians have rallied nationwide for same-sex marriage protesting for it to become legalised.
