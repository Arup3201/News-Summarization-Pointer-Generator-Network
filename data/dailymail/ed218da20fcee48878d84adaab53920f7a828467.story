Mollycoddling teenagers can have a damaging impact on their relationships in adolescence and early adulthood, researchers found.

A study showed teenagers whose parents kept tight control over them struggled to form relationships without losing independence and were more likely to bow to peer pressure.

The University of Virginia study, in journal Child Development, followed nearly 200 youngsters aged 13 to 21.

It found 13-year-olds whose parents used emotional tactics such as guilt to control them were less able to keep balanced relationships at 18 and 21. 

The more psychological control teenagers had from their parents, the worse they got throughout their adolescence at establishing autonomy and closeness in their relationships, researchers found.

The level of control could also predict the success of their future relationships, as the better their ability to be close to romantic partners yet maintain their own confidence and identity was at 18, the better it was at 21.

Lead researcher Barbara Oudekerk said parents who used guilt, withdrawing love or emotional manipulation to control their teenage children were more likely to pressure them to make decisions in line with the parents’ wishes rather than their own.

She added: ‘Without opportunities to practice self-directed, independent decision making, teens might give in to their friends’ and partners’ decisions.

‘Parents often fear the harmful consequences of peer pressure in adolescence. Our study suggests that parents can promote or undermine teens’ ability to assert their own views and needs to close friends and romantic partners.

‘In addition, teens who learn - or fail to learn - how to express independence and closeness with friends and partners during adolescence carry these skills forward into adult relationships.'
