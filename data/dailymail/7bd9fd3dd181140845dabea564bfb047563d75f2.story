A woman says she is over the moon to be back with her childhood sweetheart after spending more than 25 years apart from him.

Debbie Dennis, 48, met the 'love of her life', Tim Dennis, 47, at her local youth club in Croydon when the pair were both 14 years old.

After a brief relationship, during which the teenaged couple became engaged, the pair hit a bump in the road and they broke up.

The pair dated for years as teenagers (left), even getting engaged when they were 18, but were only actually married in 2012, 31 years to the day that the couple first met (right, pictured recently)

Both went on to develop lives of their own and marry other people but when they both found themselves single again 25 years later, a chance encounter would lead them back into each others’ arms.

The couple are now married, nearly three decades after they broke up.

Mrs Dennis, a healthcare assistant and author from Blackpool, said: 'Thinking back, I regretted breaking up with Tim as soon as I said the words. It was a moment of madness - one I often returned to, even though I later made a completely separate life from him.

'I’m so happy that we’re back together now.'

Mr and Mrs Dennis first met in June 1981 when she was introduced to him by a friend at youth club.

Mrs Dennis said: 'I’d known of him because we went to the same school. He was too shy to ask me out so his friend did instead. He was very interesting with his blue rolled-up jeans, Dr Martens and shaved head.

Even after 25 years apart, the pair still thought of each other and were eventually reintroduced through Tim's sister

'It was very exciting. He was grinning at me with a cheeky smile.

'I knew fairly quickly that he was the one for me.'

The couple began a four-year relationship and became engaged when they turned 18 years old.

But as time went on, Mrs Dennis became fed up by Mr Dennis’ habit of spending time with his friends rather than her.

She said: 'I decided to give him an ultimatum. I told him love me or leave me - that unless he spent more time with me and kept the dates we made, I would break it off with him.

'It was a gamble on my part. I didn’t really want to break up with him, and I thought by giving him a shock it would bring him closer to me.

'Unfortunately, the plan backfired and he broke up with me. I was completely gutted.'

As the years went by, both went their separate ways and eventually lost contact all together.

Mrs Dennis went on to marry in February 1992 and had a daughter, now 28. Mr Dennis would also marry and have a son, now 19, a daughter, 24, and three stepdaughters.

By 2009 Mrs Dennis’s marriage had come to end and she found her thoughts returning to her childhood sweetheart.

She said: 'Even while I was married I’d wondered what Tim was doing. I knew I’d always regretted splitting up with him. I wished I’d never let him go.

The couple began regularly dating and in 2010 Tim moved from his shared house in south London to live with Debbie in Blackpool

'I would return to the adventures we’d
 had when we were teenagers. We’d had a dream of moving to the Isle of 
Wight and had been on a few trips there.

We once disturbed a wasp nest and had to run into the sea together to escape the wasps.

'We were young and daft and the memories from those days made me smile when I was feeling low.'

Shortly
 after her separation Mrs Dennis discovered that Mr Dennis’s sister was 
on the social networking site Friends Reunited, and they struck up a 
friendship.

Mrs Dennis said:
 'One afternoon I asked her what she was doing that day, and she 
mentioned that she was going off to Tim’s birthday barbeque.

'He was house-sharing with a friend at that time. I discovered that he’d been married but his relationship had come to an end and in fact he had been single for 11 years.

'I asked her to wish him a happy birthday from me and left it at that.'

To her surprise, Mr Dennis sent her a text message the following day.

Mrs Dennis said: 'His sister must have passed on my number. The text read:‘thanks for the birthday message’. I was in a hurry, so rather grumpily replied: ‘who’s this?’ 'The reply came back: ‘Someone from over 25 years ago - take a guess’.

The pair say they feel lucky to have been given a second chance to be together

'When I realised who it was, I had butterflies in my stomach. We began chatting and he said the next time I was in the south, we should go for dinner.'

The couple began regularly dating and in 2010 Mr Dennis moved from his shared house in south London to live with her in Blackpool.

She said: 'We’d never lived together before, so it was a strange thing to get used to, but we’ve been blissfully happy ever since.'

on June 9th 2012, 31 years to the day that the couple first met, they finally wed.

Mrs Dennis said: 'It was an incredible day but things didn’t exactly go according to plan. Firstly, my horse and carriage couldn’t make its way to the service because there was a gay pride march along the route.

'I called a taxi but someone jumped into it before I could reach it. I ended up running across some tramlines in my wedding dress, as people looked on. I almost fell flat on my face.

'It was almost as if fate was trying to keep us apart again, but I fought to get there on time.

'By the time I got to the service I was so hysterical that I couldn’t stop laughing. The two of us giggled all the way through the wedding. It was a wonderful, unusual day.'

Mr Dennis, who works at a biscuit factory, said: 'I was nervous about moving up to live with Debbie at first, of course, but since then life has been amazing. We’re very happy together.

'We both consider ourselves very lucky to have been given a second chance.'
