It's the only head-to-head match of the 2014 World Cup and traditionally BBC come out well ahead in the audience ratings.

Here’s Sportsmail's form guide to the BBC and ITV line-ups for Sunday's big final.

Talisman: Lionel Messi will hope to inspire Argentina to victory over Germany in the World Cup final which will be broadcast on both BBC and ITV

PRESENTERS

BBC: Gary Lineker has been at his very best in Brazil. Authoritative and engaging.

ITV: Adrian Chiles, remarkably, has smiled his way through the tournament! His beachside manner has been very original.

Form: BBC's anchor Gary Lineker has been at his very best in Brazil - authoritative and engaging

Unique: ITV anchor Adrian Chiles has smiled his way through the tournament out on the beach

COMMENTARY

BBC: Guy Mowbray and Mark Lawrenson. The BBC have resisted other options and plumped for their tried-and-trusted combination.

ITV: Clive Tyldesley and Andy Townsend are in-form big-match veterans but will know the audience is elsewhere.

Familiar faces: Guy Mowbray (left) will be the BBC's commentator and Mark Lawrenson (right) his summariser

Big stage: Clive Tyldesley (left) and Andy Townsend (right) will be commentating for a smaller audience

STUDIO PUNDITS

BBC: Alan Hansen, Alan Shearer and Rio Ferdinand. This is Hansen’s final programme, while Ferdinand is a rising star and Shearer has consistently delivered in this tournament.

IN THE MARACANA: Clarence Seedorf with Jason Mohammed.

ITV: Lee Dixon, Glenn Hoddle, Ian Wright and Martin O’Neill. Hoddle’s perceptive thoughts and O’Neill’s style are very watchable.

IN THE MARACANA: Fabio Cannavaro with Matt Smith.

Dream team: The Beeb can call upon Alan Shearer (left), Rio Ferdinand (second left) and Alan Hansen (right) in the studio during the final

On hand: Dutch legend Clarence Seedorf will also be in the Maracana Stadium for the BBC
