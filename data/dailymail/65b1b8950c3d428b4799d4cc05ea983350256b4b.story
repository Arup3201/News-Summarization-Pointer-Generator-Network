A 16-year-old girl was almost blinded after suffering an extreme allergic reaction to a beauty treatment that she let her friend perform as a 'favour'.

Katie Thompson was left with raw, blistered skin after her friend, who was studying beauty therapy, performed an eyelash tint on her last month.

The schoolgirl's face was so swollen that she could barely open her eyes - and the strong chemicals caused her eyelashes and eyebrows to burn off.

Reaction: Katie Thompson, 16, was barely able to open her eyes after suffering an extreme allergic reaction to her friend's eyebrow tint treatment, which left her face red, swollen and covered in painful blisters, left

Recovery: Katie, from Bloxwich, West Midlands, now has to go for check-ups at Walsall Manor Hospital three times a week to make sure the skin around her eyes heals correctly. Above, Katie's skin is still slightly red

But doctors warned that the treatment could have left her permanently blind. 

Katie, from Bloxwich, West Midlands, said: 'My friend is training in beauty therapy at Walsall College.

'She is learning to do eyebrow and eyelash design there so I thought I was doing her a favour, as much as she was doing me one.

'The products were just in white tubes. Everything was fine and I went to bed but the next day I woke up with heavy, severely swollen eyes.

'I looked in the mirror and I was shocked. I looked like a completely different person.

'I couldn't really see. My left eye was almost completely shut.

'I was fine at the time of the treatment. But the pain got a lot worse the next day. I just wanted to pull my eyes out. It was quite scary really.'

Shocked: Katie said that the morning after the surgery she 'looked like a completely different person'. She said that the swelling was so bad that she couldn't really see - and that her left eye was almost completely shut

Katie, who is studying health and social care, rushed to the walk-in health centre at Walsall Manor Hospital - fearing that she would be left scarred for life.

She added: 'The doctor told me I was very lucky to have my eyesight. I knew myself but the doctor told me it was an allergic reaction to the eyelash tint.

'The doctor said it must have been something in the eyelash tint that caused the reaction.

'They prescribed me with steroid tablets, cream, eye drops, penicillin, antihistamines. I was on all sorts. I had finished all my medication by about eight days.

'My friend was very apologetic. I think she was more shocked about it all. She didn't know I was going to react the way I did.

'She has done lots of other treatments before on other people and they have all been fine.

'It has scared me about having things done again. It has been painful, very uncomfortable.

'I don't blame my friend. It was a genuine accident. She feels distraught about what happened.'

Katie, who lives with her mother Patricia, 39, and her brother Ben, 10, now has to go for check-ups at the hospital three times a week to make sure her skin heals correctly.

Her mother said: 'I was very shocked when I first saw her face. The second day was worse, it was really bad then.

'It could have been a lot worse for Katie. She is certainly going to be much more careful in future.'
