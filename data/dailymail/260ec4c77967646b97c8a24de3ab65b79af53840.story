A school psychologist is facing federal charges after allegedly being intercepted by Homeland Security and traded child pornography online from a remote town on the Canadian border.

Federal prosecutors contend William Brook downloaded hundreds of child rape photos and videos at his home in Point Roberts, a small Whatcom County community located on a peninsula with no land access to the United States.

Officials say Brook was working as a psychologist for the Delta School District, which overlooks 24 elementary and seven secondary schools and is based in British Colombia.

Homeland Security agents received a tip in mid-April that Brook had been buying child pornography online, according to Seattle P.I.

'I just want to erase the stuff': Delta School District psychologist William Brook allegedly tried to delete some data after being caught with 334 images child pornography images and some videos

Point Roberts is considered a part of the United States and Washington state, but can only be accessed through Canada.

Agents stopped Brook’s car last Wednesday as he attempted to return to Point Roberts from Canada and seized his school district-issued computer.

While no child pornography was found during the stop, the Homeland Security agent said Brook 'acted extremely nervous'.

Brook is alleged to have admitted to exchanging photos of 'kids' on chat websites as in the interview progressed.

'I asked Brook if the photos were of nude children and Brook replied ‘'some of them’',' the agent said in court papers.

Brook told investigators the photos were on his home computer, the agent continued, prompting a search Brook’s Benson Road home.

Arriving at the duplex, Brook invited agents in and said 'I just want to erase the stuff', according to court papers.

Agents allowed Brook to open an online profile he’d created in which he declared his 'love' for 'pre-teen/pubescent boys and young teens' no older than 14, the Homeland Security agent told the court, according to Seattle P.I.

Agents claim to have seen that Brook had downloaded child pornography the day before and seized his computer.

According to charging papers, investigators found 334 files believed to be child pornography on the laptop, as well as a 4 gigabyte thumb drive filled with additional videos.

The images and videos pictured the rape of very young children.

Charged Thursday with possession of child pornography, Brook is expected to appear before a judge at U.S. District Court in Seattle on Monday.

He remains jailed without bond pending that hearing.
