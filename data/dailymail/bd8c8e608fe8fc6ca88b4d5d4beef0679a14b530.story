Miriam Clegg's lucrative work as a City solicitor faces embarrassing scrutiny after a controversial client launched a High Court action against her employer.

Dechert, the international law firm, has been hit with a claim over alleged ‘overcharging’ by a  Kazakhstan mining conglomerate for work carried out by the Deputy Prime Minister’s wife and her colleagues.

The £16 million bill sent to the Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) covered two years’ work by Dechert, including multiple invoices from Mrs Clegg charged at the partner rate of £570 an hour.

The row is likely to prove embarrassing for Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg – whose £134,565 salary is dwarfed by his wife’s estimated earnings of £500,000 – as he tries to court votes by pledging to tackle the soaring cost of living for ordinary families.

Mrs Clegg, who uses Miriam Gonzalez as her professional name, charges more than 90 times the current £6.31 per hour minimum wage when billing her multinational clients.   

The row comes as Lib Dem strategists have persuaded Mrs Clegg to adopt a higher profile – through more public appearances and staged photoshoots – in an apparent attempt to counter the electoral appeal of Samantha Cameron and Justine Miliband.

ENRC, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and has extensive mining interests in Kazakhstan, hired Dechert in 2011 to carry out an internal governance review following claims of corruption by a whistleblower. It has lodged a High Court claim challenging £11.6 million of the £16 million bill – although its reasons for contesting the amount cannot be reported because of legal restrictions.

The bill included charges by Mrs Clegg for making phone calls, sending emails, interviewing ENRC staff and carrying out background reading on the company.

ENRC parted with Dechert earlier this year, and the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is now carrying out a criminal investigation into ‘fraud, bribery and corruption’ at the mining giant. Alleged wrongdoing included  employees using company money to buy a guesthouse, a farming business and a horse farm.

Mrs Clegg previously advised the U.S. food conglomerate Kraft, three weeks before her husband Nick Clegg, right, described its takeover of the British chocolate firm Cadbury as 'just plan wrong'

Dozens of employees were also said to have been involved in a network of relationships with suppliers that led to ENRC paying massively inflated prices for old equipment.

Dechert, which was ordered to hand over its findings to the SFO, is understood to have complained that its investigation of ENRC was hampered by staff forging documents, wiping computer records, supplying the ‘wrong computer to the investigations team’ and setting up a ‘false office’.

Its review is also understood to have concluded that senior executives had funnelled large amounts of resources out of the company into unauthorised projects – including ‘payments to  African presidents’ – and had misled auditors about their activities.

Mrs Clegg joined Dechert two years ago as its EU trade chief, on an estimated £500,000 a year, after switching from rival law firm DLA Piper.

She made the move shortly after a senior DLA Piper lawyer, Neil Gerrard, moved to Dechert – and brought the ENRC business with him.

Mrs Clegg’s work for Dechert has previously caused controversy. Another client, the Moroccan mining giant OCP, has been criticised over mining phosphate in the Western Sahara, with human rights activists complaining about the treatment of local nomadic tribesmen – claims the company strongly denies.

And while still at DLA Piper, Mrs Clegg was advising Kraft, the US food conglomerate, just three weeks before her husband called its takeover of Cadbury ‘just plain wrong’.

Last night, Dechert and ENRC declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Mrs Clegg said: ‘I have nothing to say on the matter.’
