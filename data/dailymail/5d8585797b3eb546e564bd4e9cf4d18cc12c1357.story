Two men suspected of abducting and killing an elderly Ohio couple are facing charges including aggravated murder, kidnapping and robbery, according to an indictment released on Monday.

Robert Clark, 29, and Jeffery Stewart, 21, are accused of killing 88-year-old Doyle Chumney and his 79-year-old wife Lillian after abducting them from their home in Tuscarawas in January. 

After their daughter found their house ransacked and reported the Chumneys as missing, their bodies were found a badly-burned car the next day.

Robert Clark, 29, was indicted by a grand jury in Coshocton County, Ohio, on 15 counts including murder

Jeffery Stewart, 21, was also indicted for his suspected role in the slayings of Doyle and Lillian Chumney

Doyle, 88, and Lillian, 79, went missing from their home in Tuscarawas and their bodies were found a burned car

A Coshocton County grand jury indicted both of the men on 15 counts, including ten counts each of aggravated murder.

Clark, who led authorities on a nationwide manhunt before being arrested on February 5 in Arizona, is facing the death penalty while Stewart is not, according to the Canton Times Reporter. 

His charges include death penalty specifications for using a gun which are not included in the charges against Stewart. 

If Stewart is convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.

The jury felt the killings were premeditated and said Clark and Stewart caused the death of the Chumneys with 'prior calculation and design'.

The other charges lodged against the men include aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, kidnapping and aggravated arson. 

Clark was also classified as a repeat violent offender because he was convicted of robbery in 2010.

The men are being held separately in Tuscarawas County jail in New Philadelphia.

They can plead guilty or not guilty when they appear in front of a judge, but an arraignment date has not been set.

Clark is also suspected of being involved in the armed robberies of gas stations and convenience stores in West Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia.
