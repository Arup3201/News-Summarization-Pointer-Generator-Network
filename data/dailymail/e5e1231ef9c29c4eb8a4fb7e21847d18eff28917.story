Hotels in the notorious party resort of Magaluf are set out to kick out a record number of yob British holidaymakers this year.

Nearly 100 troublemakers have been asked to leave already this year for smashing up their hotel rooms, fighting with others guests or assaulting staff.

And hotel bosses are promising to get even tougher with unruly tourists after the rowdy Majorcan resort made headlines around the world over a video of a British teenager performing multiple sex acts in a bar for free booze.

More than 100 tourists have already been kicked out of their Magaluf hotels for trashing their rooms or fighting

A local hotel association says a staggering 92 of the 107 people members have kicked out so far this year were British. The other 15 were Irish.

The shocking figures put Magaluf on course to break its record of expulsions, 254 last year and up from 147 in 2012 and 166 in 2011.

The vast majority of those asked to leave in previous years, like this year, were British.

And around 35 per cent of the area’s hotels do not belong to the association which released the figures yesterday, meaning the real number is likely to be slightly higher.

Joan Espina, vice president of the Palmanova-Magaluf Hotel Assocation, which covers the two sister resorts, said: 'The vast majority of the expulsions are down to three reasons.

The first is guests damaging hotel furniture, kicking doors down, smashing mirrors and even throwing TVs out of their rooms.

'The others are fights with other guests and verbal and physical attacks on hotel staff.

'The vast majority are always British men, aged between 18 and 25.

'We want young people who come to enjoy themselves but within a context of respect towards other guests.

'We won’t tolerate people whose fun comes from antisocial behaviour which causes others to suffer.

'It’s got to be fun within certain limits.

'Virtually all the problems we’re experiencing are connected to the misuse of drugs and alcohols and obviously we’d urge these youngsters to take care.'

Troublemakers are put on a temporary black list so hoteliers know not to accept them.

Mr Espina explained: 'The association sends round an email with the name of the person that’s been expelled so other members are pre-warned.

'We cover 20,000 hotel beds in Magaluf and Palmanova so it is a very effective measure.

'It’s only information that’s kept for a few days and not on a long-term basis.

'Most of the people that are expelled for bad behaviour promise they won’t do it again but we usually find a lot of them have already caused trouble before.

'Where there’s been vandalism hoteliers try to get compensation from those who’ve caused it but it’s very difficult in practice.

'Usually we try to avoid getting the police involved unless it’s very serious.'

Several hotels in the area have hired private security to address the problem.

One hotel boss said: 'It’s not that the problem has necessarily got worse but more that hotels are taking a tougher approach.

'In many cases hotels now employ external security staff rather than depending on a night-time caretaker and a sole security guard they mostly employed themselves.'
