A Canadian couple has been charged with killing every member of the woman's estranged husband's immediate family.

Melissa Merritt  and Christopher Fattore of Ontario were arrested last January and charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Merritt's estranged mother-in-law, 63-year-old Bridget Harrison who died in 2010, and 40-year-old Caleb Harrison, Merritt's estranged husband who died in 2013.

Then, this week, they were also charged with the 2009 death of Bill Harrison - Caleb's father and Bridget's husband - this after all three died in the same house over the course of five years.

It is still not known what might have motivated these two to allegedly commit these crimes, though prosecutors believe custody of Harrison and Merritt's two children together played a big role.

The Toronto Star reports that police began investigating in August 2013 following Caleb's murder.

Police will not release details because of the trial, but say that Caleb died due to asphyxiation, a month after Merritt had filed for join custody of the children.

Merritt, 34, was only able to see the children every second weekend and on select holidays due to an incident in 2009 is which she abducted the children for several months while they were in the care of Bridget.

Bridget had custody while Caleb was serving an 18 month prison sentence for killing a cab driver and injuring four teenagers in a 2005 drunk driving accident that happened a month after he and Merritt, who married in 2003 after having a son and daughter, split.  

The children were abducted shortly after Bill's death in April of that year, a death that was not suspicious and assumed to be a heart attack.

Almost one year later to the day, Bridget's grandson found her dead at the bottom of her stairs, a death that was suspicious at the time.

She too died of asphyxiation, though again authorities are not releasing details.

They will also not comment on the new evidence that led to the charges in Bill's death.

In court on Thursday, Fattore, 37, and Merritt, who have four children of their own together, could be seen mouthing 'I love you' to one another.

Merritt also cried as the new charges were read against her.

The Harrison family declined to comment on the new charges.

All six of Merritt's children are currently being cared for according to police.
