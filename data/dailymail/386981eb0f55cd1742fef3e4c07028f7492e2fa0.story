Vienna’s famous palaces and opera houses are set to be joined by a new tourist attraction – the tallest wooden skyscraper in the world.

When it is completed in 2017, the timber-framed tower will be 24 storeys high with more than 200,000 square feet of commercial and residential space.

Designed by architects at RLP Rudiger Lainer+Partner, the €65million (£45million) HoHo Vienna project is expected to include a hotel, offices, flats and wellness centre.

When it is completed in 2017, about 75 per cent of the 24-storey tower will be made from wood

It will be located in Seestadt Aspern, a massive urban development site in north-east Vienna, about 75 per cent of the building will be made of wood.

The 275-ft tower will be a hybrid: it will have a concrete core with a self-supporting timber shell secured to it.

Inside, flats will have exposed wood ceilings, columns and walls to create a natural atmosphere, according to renderings released by the design firm.

Wood was chosen because the popular building material in Austria is affordable, high in quality and environmentally friendly.

With three-quarters of the building made of wood, it is expected to save 2,800 tonnes of CO2 emissions.

But the plans have sparked concerns from local fire officials as the developers, cetus Baudevelopment Gmbh, prepare to begin construction this autumn.

Vienna fire service spokesman Christian Wegner told the Guardian: ‘The main factor is that everyone wants to build higher and higher buildings.

‘An 84-metre-high building in Europe is not usual and there are a lot of necessities that have to be realised.

‘A few of us were upset because it was crazy to present an idea like this that has not been discussed with everyone yet.’

He said special tests must be conducted on the hybrid model and a fail-safe sprinkler system.

The architects said: ‘The timber construction system provides high efficiency in terms of thermal insulation and serviceability.

‘Wood composite floors are secured to the central concrete supporting cores, and extend out to the building edge.

‘These floor panels are supported by a wooden column system around the outline of the building. This structure then supports pre-fabricated external wall modules that combine solid wood panels with an “earthy” concrete shell to form the building's facade.’ 

When it opens in approximately two years HoHo Vienna will be nearly three times as tall as a current record holder.
