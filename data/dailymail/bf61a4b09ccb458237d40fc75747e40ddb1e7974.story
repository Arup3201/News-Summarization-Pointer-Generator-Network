Health risk: Pensioners have been warned to drink less alcohol or risk damaging their health

Pensioners were warned last night to drink less alcohol or risk severely damaging their health.

Doctors and public health experts said heavy drinking among the elderly was a ‘hidden problem’ and safe limit guidelines for over-65s should be halved.

They warned that older people were unaware of the health risks and that their bodies were less able to cope.

They said metabolism was slower in the elderly, meaning the toxic chemicals linger longer in the body, while drunkenness can raise the odds of depression and mask the development of dementia.

Alcohol-related falls can lead to years of disability, while drinks can interfere with prescription pills, with dangerous effects.

Retirement, bereavement and loneliness can all increase the thirst for alcohol, which can trigger problems from dementia to disabling falls and liver damage.

Andrew Langford, of the British Liver Trust, said: ‘The drinking patterns of the over-65s have changed, particularly in women.

'The idea of an older woman with a glass of sherry is way out of date. It is more likely to be a bottle of wine a day.’

He added that because much of the drinking done by over-65s happened at home, it was largely a hidden problem.

Emily Robinson, of Alcohol Concern, said: ‘It’s time we stopped thinking that alcohol is just a problem for binge-drinking youngsters.

'Unless we start taking this seriously and acknowledge the health problems too much alcohol can cause, the situation will only get worse.’

Newcastle University researchers want  a new recommended drinking limit for over-65s and special advice on alcohol, tailored to the needs of older people.

The call comes as the Department of Health reviews alcohol guidelines for all age groups and follows a recommendation from psychiatrists that existing limits should be halved.

The Royal College of Psychiatrists wants men over 65 to be limited to 1.5 units a day and women to one unit.

The current advice is that men stop at three to four units a day and women limit themselves to two to three.

‘Many older people are drinking to a 
level that is having a long-term impact on their health, even if the 
damage they are doing is not always apparent.’

Dr Graeme Wilson, Newcastle University

Half a pint of ordinary-strength beer counts as one unit. A large glass of wine contains three units.

NHS statistics show that over-65s are more likely to drink than young people. And they are also more likely than any other group to drink every day of the week.

Alcohol-related admissions to hospital for everything from liver disease to dementia caused by brain cells being killed off by booze has soared by 150 per cent in those aged between 60 and 74 in the past decade.

Dr Graeme Wilson, of Newcastle University, said: ‘Many older people are drinking to a level that is having a long-term impact on their health, even if the damage they are doing is not always apparent.’

The researchers told the journal PLoS ONE that while the elderly may believe they have built up a tolerance to booze, alcohol can cause more damage to the ageing body.

Dr Wilson’s team quizzed older people about their attitude to alcohol.

Many were ‘very blasé’ about the dangers, with some saying they had drunk for many years without their health being harmed.

One woman who drank a bottle of wine a day said she didn’t have a problem because she had never ‘been found drunk in a corner’.

Others said being given a free bus pass meant they could drink more, while some drank to relieve the pain of osteoporosis.

Katie Haighton, one of the study’s authors, said GPs were loath to intervene, with many not wanting to deprive patients of enjoyment later on in life.

She added: ‘A lot of those we interviewed said the messages around alcohol were very confusing.

'There is a need to develop new approaches to target the older population.’

Age UK, which funded the Newcastle University study, said that although the spotlight usually fell on young people, the biggest increases in alcohol-related illnesses were in the elderly.

The Department of Health said that as well as reviewing the guidelines, it had introduced alcohol risk assessments at GPs’ surgeries.
