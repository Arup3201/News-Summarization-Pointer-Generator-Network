Fed-up: Husband Stephen Hirst, 53, gave his double amputee wife a potentially lethal dose of morphine to 'shut her up' because he wanted some 'peace and quiet'

A fed-up husband gave his double amputee wife a potentially lethal dose of morphine to 'shut her up' because he wanted some 'peace and quiet'.

Stephen Hirst, 52, tricked his disabled wife Catherine, 43, into taking six times her normal dose of medication because he could not cope with their constant arguments.

Mrs Hirst, who is confined to a wheelchair, needs to take two 10 milligrams morphine tablets every morning.

But on September 30 last year her husband swapped her medication for 60 milligram pills - and she swallowed both as usual.

The effect of the massive dose knocked Mrs Hirst out for the entire day.

Hirst, of Exeter, Devon, admitted unlawfully administering a drug intending to 'aggrieve' his wife and was jailed for 13 months at Exeter Crown Court.

Judge Phillip 
Wassall told him: 'You deliberately administered a toxic substance which
is a class A drug and that is an aggravating feature.

'We are dealing with the administration of a toxic substance which 
carried a risk. You used it simply to shut her up so you could have some
peace and quiet, so it is a serious offence.'

After Mrs Hirst woke up she called NHS Direct for advice and paramedics were sent to check on her but medics ruled out any lasting damage and urged her to call the police.

Mr David Bowen, prosecuting, said Hirst had been married to his wife 
for about five years and he was her full time carer, helping her cope 
with the effects of losing both legs.

He said: 'She woke up on September 30 and took her tablets which she thought were two 10 mg doses of morphine sulphate.

'The defendant had substituted the 10 mg tablets for 60 mg ones, so she 
took a dose of 120 mg instead of the intended 20 mg. She started to feel
unwell.

'She challenged her husband about the over dosage and he admitted what he had done but could not give her a reason.

'She was so unwell she phoned NHS Direct and they called the police. He 
was asked if he had tried to kill her and said no and said she had been 
in a lot of pain.

'He admitted what he had done to police and said he required respite 
from his caring duties. The victim suffered no long term effects.'

Mr David Evans, defending, said Hirst was struggling to cope with his 
duties as carer and gave her the drugs to give himself a break from 
their constant arguments.

He said: 'She had in the preceding months withdrawn from him 
emotionally, conversationally and sexually. There were many arguments 
between them which could be very wearing for both of them.

'Utterly foolishly, on the Saturday night he changed her medication and 
gave her the higher dose hoping to put her to sleep for longer than 
usual and some respite. He did not think it through very clearly.

'She spent most of the following day sleeping and the following day rang
NHS Direct to ask if it was safe to take her usual dose. They called 
paramedics and the police.

'He apologised to her and admitted what he had done. He was aware he had
done wrong. It has led to the end of his marriage. The divorce is 
proceeding and he is living with his 87-year-old mother in Leeds.'

Hirst was cleared of a more serious charge of unlawfully administering a drug intending to 'endanger' her life.

Speaking from the home they shared in Exeter his wife said she did not want to talk about the case.

Hirst was also given another month in prison to run concurrently after police found level one child porn images on a computer at his home.
