London Irish boss Brian Smith believes Harry Allen deserves another chance after the hooker made his first start since serving a one-year drugs ban against Saracens on Saturday.

Allen tested positive for benzoylecgonine, a metabolite of cocaine, and a non-specified stimulant during a drugs test in November 2013 and was subsequently sacked by his former club, Harlequins.

The 23-year-old was picked up on a short-term arrangement by the Exiles last month and, as a result of mounting injury problems in the front row, played in the 22-6 defeat at Allianz Park.

Asked if there were any concerns about signing the former England Under 18 front row, Smith said: ‘You consider all of those things obviously, but he’s a young bloke and he’s made a mistake. Like everyone, he deserves a second chance.

‘Once I got to see and speak to him, I was convinced that he’s on the straight and narrow. He’s a talented young player. It’s obviously been a really tough 12 months for him, as you’d appreciate, and he’s been in the wilderness.’

Irish were overpowered in the Premiership tie, but Allen still managed a decent 82 per cent line-out accuracy. 

He will be hoping to be involved against Exeter next week and Smith hinted that the forward could be given a prolonged run in the match-day squad.

‘I said to him in the changing room after the game that he’s put himself back on the radar,’ said Smith. ‘He hasn’t played much rugby in the last year and he played 80 minutes out there. I think he will sleep pretty well.’
