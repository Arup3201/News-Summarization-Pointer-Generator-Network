A wildlife park was forced to shut down after more than 300 manatees swam into the central pool at once.

The rush at Three Sisters Springs in Citrus County, Florida, came after a rise in tides at noon on Monday.

With an average of 65 manatees in the pool at once during cold weather, volunteers blocked off public walkways as they tried to ensure the animals' safety.

Rush for warmth! More than 300 manatees swam into the central pool of Three Sisters Springs on Monday

Manatees are known to gravitate towards shallow springs during spells of low temperature in a bid to warm up.

Last week around 220 gathered in the pool.

But Monday's shift was a dramatic surge.

The park remains closed and wildlife officials will assess the situation at sunrise on Tuesday.
