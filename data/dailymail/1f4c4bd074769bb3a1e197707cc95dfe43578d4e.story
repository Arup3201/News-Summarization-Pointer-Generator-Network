After track problems caused delays and misery for thousands of passengers yesterday, it was a brave decision to carry the Olympic torch on London's tube network.

But to the relief of Games organisers, the stunt passed without incident this morning as the flame was transported along the District line between Wimbledon and Wimbledon Park

Tube train driver John Light, 64, carried the torch in the cab of a train adorned with the Olympic rings to start Day 67 of the torch relay.

But a series of problems across the network today and yesterday showed that London may struggle to cope with the millions of visitors to the Olympic Park.

Services to and from Stratford were delayed for a second day, this time following a signal failure at Custom House on the Docklands Railway. It meant there were delays between Stratford International and Woolwich Arsenal and between Beckton and Canning Town.

On the main line, evening services using three main London stations - London Bridge, Cannon Street and Charing Cross - were delayed by a signalling problem which resulted in buses having to replace trains between Tunbridge Wells and Tonbridge in Kent.

In the morning, London Overground trains between Euston and Kilburn High Road and Piccadilly line services between Heathrow and Hatton Cross were suspended following track faults.

It followed similar problems yesterday on the Overground between Canonbury and Stratford - where the Olympic Park is located - and on the Central line.

And it came as 60,000 people tried to reach the Olympic Stadium for a rehearsal of Friday's opening ceremony.

The torch travelled from Kingston upon Thames to Ealing today in the latest leg of the nationwide relay and one of the morning stops was Kew Gardens.

Among the 144 torchbearers today were double Olympic rowing champion James Cracknell, skier Chemy Alcott, singer Katy B and music producer Mark Ronson.

Mr Light, who has worked for London Underground since 1963, said: 'Transporting the Olympic flame is a once in a lifetime experience. I feel really privileged to have been given this opportunity to be part of the Games in this way.

'I’ve worked for London Underground for 49 years so to be able to hold the flame on its Tube journey is a huge honour for me and a moment I will treasure for the rest of my life.'

Cracknell was the day's first torchbearer, running with the torch at the Hook Community Centre in Kingston.

Skeleton racer Adam Pengilly, who won silver at the 2009 World Championships, carried the flame in Kingston.

Musician Mark Ronson called for Sir Paul McCartney to perform at the London 2012 closing ceremony as he gave the Olympic flame a taste of university life.

The Grammy award-winning producer joined singer Katy B at Brunel University in west London as they carried the torch on day 67 of the relay.

Both music stars were nominated to carry the flame after they produced an anthem for the Games, sampling the sounds made by international athletes training for London 2012.

After running with the flame, Ronson revealed he has been working with Sir Paul and said the former Beatles star would be the perfect choice to represent Britain on stage at the Olympic closing ceremony.

Ronson said: 'I think people like Paul McCartney are ingrained in the history of British music.

'We've been working together a little bit. When he tells you to show up, you just show up.

After running with the flame, Ronson revealed said: 'Once the Olympics starts to descend on the city you want to be part of that emotion'

'I think that the other concerts like
 Blur and The Specials are great, and with Dizzee and us at Hyde Park on
 Thursday, London is such a centre for a music. It's a good way to 
celebrate that.'

Recalling that he was nicknamed 
'Wrong-way Ronson' at school after going the wrong way in a relay race, 
Ronson joked: 'This entire week I was doing four and five kilometre runs
 in the mountains of Corsica so I was sort of ready.

'It's pretty emotional with so many 
people out. London is such a spoilt city in a way because there is so 
much in the way of culture. But once the Olympics starts to descend on 
the city you want to be part of that emotion.'

Katy B said: 'I can't believe it's 
happening and it's kicking off on Friday. I feel really lucky to be 
holding the torch so close to the Games beginning.'

Ronson and Katy B created a musical anthem for Coca-Cola's Move to the Beat campaign from sounds produced through sport. To
 create the track, Ronson travelled the world to record the sounds of 
young athletes engaging in a variety of sports before teaming up with 
Katy B to provide the vocals.

The song, Anywhere In The World, was 
released as a single worldwide in May and will provide the soundtrack 
for TV commercials and Coca-Cola events during the Olympic Games.

Also running will be 92-year-old Eileen Gray, a former mayor of Kingston who was one of the first women to cycle for Britain.

The
 final torchbearer of the day, Thomas Thacker, 30, from Southall, lit a cauldron at Ealing's Walpole Park.

The event will include a performance from hip hop star Rizzle Kicks and dancers Twist and Pulse.

spirit.

The torch will travel through all of London's 33 boroughs this week - and it has already passed through one fictional one.

Last night, the torch visited the borough of Walford when it appeared in a special live version of BBC soap EastEnders.

One of the soap's best known characters, Billy Mitchell - played by actor Perry Fenwick - ran through the fictional borough with the flame as other cast members and 450 extras looked on.

The flame was also carried by actor Sir Patrick Stewart and around the hallowed lawns of Wimbledon by Andy Murray and Venus Williams.

favourite Usain Bolt got into the London spirit by posing with a

Bolt,
 who won three gold medals at the last Olympics in Beijing, is one of 
the star attractions of the Games, but doubts remain over his fitness 
following a hamstring injury.

Yesterday, a waxwork of Bolt performing his trademark celebration was unveiled at Madame Tussauds in London.
