Celtic have landed a £212,000 Champions League bonus — after UEFA hammered Manchester City for breaching financial fair play rules.

England’s champions were fined £50million for the FFP breaches but will only pay £20million provided they comply with break-even rules in future.

Paris St Germain and Zenit St Petersburg were amongst nine clubs fined and the 70 clubs who reached the Champions League and Europa League group stages will each receive Euros 265,000 (£212,000) from the penalties.

Beneficiaries: Celtic are among the clubs who will receive the funds from the FFP fines

Buying: Manchester City owner Sheikh mansour shows no sign of stopping his spending spree

Similar sums will be distributed to clubs who comply with the FFP rules in this season’s European competitions – meaning Celtic will double their money next season after reaching the Europa League group stage.

The deal was hammered out in talks between the European Clubs’ Association and UEFA with ECA chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge saying: ‘It was an agreement between UEFA and the clubs that it was money belonging to the clubs.’

UEFA president Michel Platini addressed the ECA conference in Geneva attended by Celtic, Rangers and Motherwell and reiterated his commitment to FFP saying: ‘We will see whether any imperfections can be ironed out and whether there is room to further improve the system.’

Parkhead chief executive Peter Lawwell also lifted an ECA best achievement in marketing award after Celtic installed state of the art wifi last season.

Advantage: The money City have been fined will be redistributed to other Champions League clubs

Selling: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho insists his side have had to become a selling club due to the rules
