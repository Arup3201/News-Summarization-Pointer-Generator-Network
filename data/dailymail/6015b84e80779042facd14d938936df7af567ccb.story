Apple’s latest iPhone advertisement is a touching story, showing a young boy staring at his phone’s screen throughout the whole of his family’s Christmas.

Although his family think he’s being ignorant, the twist at the end is that he was using the device to record a Christmas video all along.

But, as Business Insider points out, the advert has a fundamental flaw - throughout the advert he is holding the phone vertically, yet when he shows the footage to his family, it has been shot horizontally.

Apple's latest iPhone advert shows a young boy staring at his phone's screen throughout his family's Christmas. Although his family think he's being ignorant, the twist at is that he was using the device to record a Christmas video. Yet despite the phone being held vertically, pictured, the final video has been shot horizontally

The camera on the iPhone 5S was a significant improvement from the iPhone 5.

Its 8MP sensor was 15 per cent larger than on the previous model.

Apple has also increased its light sensitivity by a third. 

The HD camera records video in 1080p.

It lets users take photos as they film footage, and has enhanced slow-motion editing tools.

When a video is recorded on an iPhone held vertically and viewed on a horizontal screen, the image becomes narrow and is blocked out by two black sections on either side.

A parody video of the advert has even been created, using the original footage, that shows what the video would have actually looked like.

The shots are cropped and detail is missing. 

The advert proved a hit with viewers, however, with many taking to Twitter to praise Apple. 

In the advert for the iPhone 5S, this is footage shot as part of the young boy's surprise Christmas video and played on the family's TV

If the phone had been held vertically during filming, the footage would have looked like this instead. What the reports don't mention, however, is that video footage may have been filmed in vertical and rotated to appear like its been recorded horizontally using video editing software

Twitter user Graeme Tait said: ‘Apple's new Christmas iPhone advert is just perfect. Best ad they've done in years.’

While ThinkingDigital added: ’Apple Holiday advert. Is this the first great Apple ad of the post-Jobs era?’

Stuart
 Miles, from technology site Pocket-lint editor also remarked how the 
advert doesn’t even mention the technical specifications of the phone or
 the camera, yet is still effective.

Heartwarming: The advert recreates all the classic scenes we associate with the perfect family Christmas

Snow fun: It attempts to show how an apparently antisocial activity - phone geekery - can be wholesome

Magical: The ad eschews the typical gadget hard sell, and at no point even mentions the iPhone camera specs

Snow angels: The camera on the iPhone 5S was in fact a significant improvement from the iPhone 5

Family time: The iPhone's HD camera can capture your's in high definition 1080p video
