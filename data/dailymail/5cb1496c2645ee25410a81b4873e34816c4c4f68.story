Posh Spice has long been making fashionistas sick. Who could fail to be envious of her jet-set lifestyle, her beautiful family or her burgeoning fashion empire? 

But the newly discovered medical condition Poshitis is not a malady caused by excessive jealousy but the name experts have given to a real physical problem — muscle strain caused by carrying heavy bags.

Experts are blaming the A-list’s favoured 'Arm-Hook Crook' (AHC) — the trend for carrying an oversized weighty handbag on a bent elbow — for a rise in the number of women suffering shoulder problems, torn muscles and inflamed tendons.

And I’m ashamed to say, I’m one of them. Earlier this year, I purchased a gorgeous new designer bag. Although it was, in the words of Stella Artois, 'reassuringly expensive', it wasn’t the price tag that left me wincing.

Made by luxury French fashion house Celine, my new tote is heavy duty leather and full of useful pockets that fasten with several chunky zips.

It’s got extra flaps and reinforced straps and metal studs on the bottom so it doesn’t get ruined if you put it down on the floor (but as it cost more than my first car, this is something I never do). 

Despite it’s equally hefty price tag, the handle is too small to fit over my shoulder, so, of course, I do the whole ‘arm hook crook’ thing.

Yet since I bought my Celine bag, I’ve had a relapse of an earlier jumbo handbag-related ailment — sporadic but severe bouts of shoulder pain that radiate down into the pectoral muscle on my chest.

It’s unsurprising then, that oversized totes are not only loved by the style set but by osteopaths, chiropractors and physiotherapists, too, as handbag-related injuries are boosting their bank balances.

I first felt my 'handbag injury' almost four years ago when I noticed a sharp pain in my right shoulder. But because I’d had a car accident a few years earlier that left me with a cracked sternum and damaged muscles in my upper back and around my collarbone, I put it down to a flare-up of that.

Then, after a few weeks of nagging twinges, I went to see a physiotherapist who, after taking one look at my overloaded Mulberry bag, promptly sent me to fashion purgatory by telling me to go home via Millets and invest in a Karrimor backpack.

'The kind worn by hikers' he said. 'Make sure you get one with padded straps and wear it on both shoulders.'

I didn’t, nay, couldn’t! But I found the bag’s abandoned shoulder strap from the depths of my wardrobe and stopped carrying the equivalent of four bricks in it. Briefly, my symptoms abated. 

Several years later, fashion’s love affair with the large handbag is not only going strong, it’s got stronger. Hermes Birkin bags are more popular than ever, Mulberry’s new Willow is rather substantial.

Then there’s Phillip Lim’s latest number, the 31 Hour leather tote and Alexander McQueen’s Heroine handbag.

My Celine model is called the 'Luggage'. It’s a fitting moniker for something that currently houses my iPad, iPhone, BlackBerry, complete make-up bag, pair of flat shoes, a diary, a note book, my keys, two pens, a bottle of water, several hairbands and various assorted lip balms. 

'We have seen a huge increase in women with shoulder and neck problems caused by handbags,' said physiotherapist Sammy Margo, who also says some patients are lugging around bags weighing one-and-a-half stone. 'Women may think they are following a catwalk trend, but they are storing up trouble.'

Perhaps so, but when it comes  to bags, women know that size  does matter. Celebrities may favour large bags to make them look smaller, but most women simply carry them out of necessity. It’s that, or a small bag accompanied by two linen shopping bags full of everything a modern girl needs, swinging from your shoulders.

Having flirted with a mini Mulberry shoulder bag throughout winter (it could barely fit my purse and a lipstick, meaning keys were left languishing precariously in my pocket) and an envelope-style snakeskin clutch bag throughout spring (it gave me hand cramp and I eventually left it under a chair) there was no option but to big-up my bag again.

This is not something Michael Tanner, Performance Specialist at London’s exclusive Bodyism (the gym beloved by celebrities such as Elle Macpherson and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) approves of.

'Carrying a heavy bag has many postural affects on the body,' says Michael. 'It not only pulls down the shoulder, which can put constant strain on the neck muscles, but our bodies naturally lean away from the side on which we’re holding a weight — in this case a bag.

'This leaning leads to a tightening of the opposite side of the neck, as well as throwing your shoulders, hips, knees and ankles out of alignment.

'Don’t even get me started on high heels,' he adds. Oops. I daren’t tell Michael what I am wearing today.

But if I had to make a choice between the two fashion evils, I know which I’d choose. And let’s just say I won’t be hotfooting it to Millets anytime soon.
