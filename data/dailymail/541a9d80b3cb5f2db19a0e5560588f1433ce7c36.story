A three-year-old girl fell to her death from her family's fifth floor apartment after getting locked inside a bathroom with her younger sister.

Rusroshi Barua was found seriously injured in the snowy courtyard  of the apartment building in Queens, New York around 2.30 pm yesterday. She was rushed to Elmhurst Hospital, where she later died.

Rusroshi had fallen from the bathroom window after accidentally getting locked inside with her two-year-old sister.

Her distressed parents called the superintendent, Hazar Addyli, who got into the bathroom but found only the younger child, who simply pointed to the window.

Mr Addyli told the New York Post: 'They called me and said the kids were locked in the bathroom. I went in, and there was one.

'I went downstairs in the back and found the child,' he said. 'I called 911.'

One neighbor, Ira Oppenheimer, said: 'The father came running down with the wife. He didn’t have any shoes on.

'They
were both screaming as they were running toward to the ambulance. The 
father was yelling, "That’s my daughter! That’s my daughter!"'

Police are trying to determine how the girls got locked in the bathroom and how long they were inside before Rusroshi fell. No criminality is suspected, they said.

There were no protective bars installed around the window which Rusroshi fell from, and it is unclear whether the window was open before the girls entered the bathroom.

Mr Addyli insisted all of the 32nd Street apartment’s windows had safety bars installed when the family moved in and said there had been no requests to fix or replace any of the bars.

A family friend, Shaikritty Barua, 39, escorted Rusroshi's wailing father Pappu Barua, out of Elmhurst Hospital yesterday and said: 'It’s very sad. You can’t imagine, for now, they lost a child. They are not able to talk,'.

Rusroshi's mother was with them but had to be supported because she could barely walk.
