A 46-year-old woman reeling from a break-up shot dead her 15-year-old son Thursday morning, set her house on fire and then turned the gun on herself in a tragic murder-suicide her daughter says was 'preventable'.

The bodies of Carla Gilliland and her son Parker Gilliland-Wampler were found inside their burning home on North Red Hill Road in Ellettsville, Indiana Thursday morning.

On the morning of July 10, neighbors heard the sound of gun shots before they saw the Gilliland's home become engulfed in flames. The Monroe County Coroner ruled Parker's death Friday a homicide, and his mother's death a suicide.

Overcome with sadness: In the weeks leading up to the fire, Gilliland had allegedly become depressed due to domestic issues with Parker's father

Police believe Gilliland first shot dead her son, before starting the fire and then shot herself.

Monroe County Sheriff's Detective Sgt Brad Swain said the family had been dealing with some 'domestic issues' involving Gilliland and Parker's father in the weeks leading up to the incident. He also said that Gilliland had made comments about wanting to hurt herself and her son. One witness told WTHR that Gilliland was having a hard time dealing with a 'family breakup'.

'She's just been sad lately, depress. Some issues she didn't share,' a neighbor named Angel said. 'Tried to help out as much as we could. It's just a tragedy.

Warning signs: Police say they were called to the home Parker shared with his mother in the weeks leading up to Thursday's tragic incident

Police were even called to the residence sometime in the past few weeks when Parker expressed concern about his mom's behavior.

However, police did not seem to intervene as the boy remained under his mother's guardianship. Sgt Swain did not provide details about the call since no report was filed.

'I would caution we have legal parameters to operate by, and child protective services has parameters they have to operate by, and they are restricting sometimes,' Swain said.

'There are situations where people have family matters and worries, and they may have expectations that canâ€™t be met by public safety and social services, because we have to follow guidelines written in our laws and in our Constitution.'

But Katie Gilliland, Parker's older sister, has shot back at Sgt Swain in a Facebook post, writing that her little brother told police his mother made threats on his life and they did not act.

Trapped: Parker's sister Katie Gilliland says her brother told police in the last few weeks that he feared for his life, but that they made him stay with his mother anyway

'You talk about these parameters you have to follow. But when a teenage boy tells a [S]heriff that his mom has a gun and wants to shoot him, your [sic] telling me it's in the [C]onstitution to make him stay with her. False.

Katie elaborated about her brother's 'preventable' death on a GoFundMe page that has been started to raise money for funeral costs.

'I would like everyone to know. That the system failed,' she wrote. 'It failed me. And it most certainly failed my baby brother. CPS and [Sheriff's] department were aware that [P]ark was afraid for his life to be in that house...Yet they made him go back.'

Parker was a star student and athlete at Edgewood High School, where he would have been a sophomore in the fall.

His funeral was scheduled for Sunday afternoon, and mourners were asked to wear their favorite superhero shirt in memory of Parker.
