Miss McVey was answering a question on mental health, Mr Bercow interjected to ask her to hurry up

House of Commons Speaker John Bercow has been accused of sexism after likening a female minister to a kitchen appliance.

Mr Bercow said the Conservative Employment Minister Esther McVey was like 'washing machine' that keeps going just when it appears to have stopped.

He intervened as the former GMTV presenter was giving her fourteenth response to questions in the Commons.

Miss McVey was answering a question on mental health, Mr Bercow interjected to ask her to hurry up.

He said: 'I am reminded of the feeling when one thinks the washing machine will stop — but it does not!'

MPs questioned whether the Speaker should be likening a female minister to a domestic appliance.

Ealing North Labour MP Stephen Pound said: 'A washing machine metaphor for a woman minister is seldom a good idea. Let's see how he spins his way out of this one!'

Angie Bray, Conservative MP for Ealing Central and Acton, said it was an 'unnecessarily rude' put-down.

She said: 'I'm not sure it's for him to criticise the style in which she chooses to answer her questions.'

Miss McVey also appeared put out by the Speaker's remarks.

When SNP MP Dr Eilidh Whiteford asked the next question, on claims that the Tories are planning to cut 30,000 jobs from the Department for Work and Pensions if they win the next election, the minister simply replied: 'For the sake of brevity and clarity, those figures are not true at all.'

The Speaker added: 'That was exemplary brevity and clarity, I must concede.'

Mr Bercow regularly interrupts during Commons debates to ask for contributions to be as short as possible so more MPs can have their say.

The Speaker is an increasingly divisive figure in Parliament after being appointed in 2009 after a secret vote with many Tories accusing him of being biased towards Labour.

But The Speaker has defended his controversial record by arguing that his moves to modernise the Commons have got parliament 'off its knees'.

Miss McVey, 47, has shot through the Tory ranks to attend Cabinet after being elected an MP in 2010.

The glamorous former TV presenter, appearing on ITV's Loose Women last month, raised eyebrows after admitting she wanted to become Prime Minister.

Miss McVey was asked by Janet Street Porter – who was the MP's boss when she started in television – if she had designs on Number 10.

The Tory cabinet minister said: 'To be honest, it is not as simple as that. But if I had to do a yes or no I'll be honest and say yes.'
