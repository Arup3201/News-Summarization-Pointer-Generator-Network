A Houston-area man was in critical condition after being shot in the face when he tried to take a loaded pistol away from a 3-year-old boy, police said on Monday.

Patrick Sanders, 20, was sleeping on the couch when the gun slipped out of his pants on to the floor in the incident that took place on Saturday in a Houston apartment.

The child then handled the gun and Sanders tried to grab it from the toddler, police said.

Dangerous territory: Patrick Sanders, 20, was sleeping on the couch when the gun slipped out of his pants on to the floor and eventually made its way into the hands of a 3-year-old (not pictured) who shot him in the face

'At that time, the gun went off and Sanders was shot in the face. The child was not injured,' Houston Police said in a statement.

Neither the name of the child nor the child's relationship to the shooter have been disclosed.

According the New Yorkers Against Gun Violence who gathered statistics from all over America, over 1,300 victims of unintentional shootings between 2005 to 2010 were under 25 years of age.

A federal government study of unintentional shootings found that 8 per cent of accidental shooting deaths resulted in shots fired by children under the age of 6.

Around 33 per cent of U.S. households contain a gun and half of them didn't lock up their guns.

40 per cent of those households are inhabited by kids under the age of 18.

Even though Sanders was not shot to death, he was shot in the face and scarred for life if he survives.

The U.S. General Accounting office has estimated that in order to lower the number of unintentional shooting deaths and injuries one should provide a child-proof safety lock and a loading indicator

The Mail Online called the Houston Police Department but no one was able to comment on whether any charges were filed.
