Thirty people were injured this morning when an icy bridge caused a massive pile-up of 70 cars, two tractor-trailers and one box trailer in Worcester, Massachusetts.

There were no fatalities and none of the injuries were serious, but the 6:45am accident did cause traffic to stop for hours in both directions on route 1-290. Route 1-290 eastbound wasn't reopened until 10am, followed by the westbound reopening just before noon.

As soon as we hit the bridge, I mean we came over the top and it was a sheet of ice,' driver Jill Conway told NECN. 'We saw cars every which way and tried to slow down and realized it was just total ice. I chose to go into the divider to slow down, and, you know, there was nothing I could do.'

Pile-up: 70 cars, two tractor-trailers, and a box trailer were involved in a crash this morning when a bridge in Worcester, Massachusetts froze over

No fatalities: There were no fatalities in the crash, but at least 30 people were bussed off the road to be treated for minor injuries

Trapped: Some of the cars involved in the crash were pushed underneath a tractor-trailer, shown above

Freezing temperatures over night caused the bridge where the crash happened to freeze over.

Bridges freeze faster than roads for two reasons. One is that they are exposed on all sides to the weather, which allows heat to escape faster.

Also, most bridges are made of steel and concrete which conducts heat more than asphalt making temperatures variable.

Those injured in the crash were bussed off the highway and taken to the hospital, while some lucky enough to drive off in their own cars recalled the scary situation.

One driver says it was a 'miracle' that her family didn't get hit. 

Inventory: About 25 crashed cars were taken off the road and cataloged by police at a local lot

Caution: The accident happened on a bridge in Worcester. Bridges freeze faster than roads because most are constructed with heat-conducing asphalt and they are being hit on all sides by the elements

Slippery: The Massachusetts State Police has advised drivers to stay at home for the time being due to the dangerous driving conditions

'I was trying to stop my car, but I was able to get around the tractor-trailer and stop my car and then try to just pull over because cars were kind of crashing up behind us.

They have advised drivers to stay at home for the time being, due to the dangerous conditions on the roads.

The weather impacted other parts of central and eastern Massachusetts today.

A section of Route 9 was closed and other accidents were reported on Route 146.

The Massachusetts Department of Transportation dispatched some 125 crews to treat roads in the area today.
