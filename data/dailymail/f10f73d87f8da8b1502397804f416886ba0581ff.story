Sonia Elliman is an impeccably spoken septuagenarian who has produced three daughters: a judge, an opera singer and a legal adviser.

So, she’s the most unlikely person you can imagine to have a conversation with you about wearing a bikini under her coat, accosting young men in the park or what it feels like to walk into a waxing salon and ask  for a vajazzle — that intimate body decoration so beloved of the girls in The Only Way Is Essex.

Indeed, she’s rather stunned that she’s au fait with such topics herself, but then lets out a mischievous laugh.

‘It is rather fun, isn’t it? It isn’t good for life to be too predictable.’

Sonia is one of the irrepressible stars of Off Their Rockers, an ITV hidden camera show where the pranksters are all old enough, frankly, to know better.

The programme typically involves seemingly sweet little old ladies or dapper grandads needing help — sometimes with a mobile phone, often with directions — in the street.

They usually pick young people, often teenagers, to ask for assistance. Then something untoward — embarrassing, rude or downright baffling — happens.

So, we have the fusty old dear asking a complete stranger to help her read a text message from her doctor — informing her that she is pregnant with twins.

Or the shuffling pensioner who asks the girl beside her at the bus stop for some assistance — with scattering her dead husband’s ashes while they wait for the bus.

‘Would you like to say anything, 
dear?’ she asks, while the poor young woman looks on, speechless. This 
was one of Sonia’s performances.

One recurring sketch involves one of the pranksters approaching someone and asking them to pull their finger.

When they do, the elderly lady breaks wind, says ‘That’s better,’ and walks off — invariably leaving their ‘helper’ incredulous, and often doubled over with laughter.

Another requires two lady pranksters, who approach an unsuspecting soul saying that they are having a disagreement and could they have help in resolving it.

Their question? ‘Which one of us has the better bikini body?’

Sonia’s CV might groan with highbrow theatrical jobs — she has been an actress since she was eight years old — but this particular job was quite a departure, though she does point out that she was once in a Kaiser Chiefs music video.

‘It was I Predict A Riot. It was a Victorian street scene and I was dancing around. I can’t quite recall why now. But it was great fun. I’d do it again.’

All the hoaxers are actors, and good ones, too, given how pretty much everyone falls for their sob stories.

‘It was quite embarrassing to do some of the pranks,’ says Sonia. ‘Because with real acting the person you are talking to is usually acting, too.

‘With this job, there was quite a lot 
of improvisation going on. And we never knew whether the person we 
approached was going to laugh, hit us or call the police.’

In one encounter, an elderly nun runs amok on her mobility scooter, wreaking havoc all round.

Hidden camera shows were introduced to the UK by Jonathan Routh, a presenter and journalist who adapted a hit American show called Candid Camera for audiences here, and became its chief prankster.

It ran for seven years in the 1960s and was revived twice in the 70s. The show made Routh a cult figure. Even though he died in 2008, aged 80, some of his most enduring japes are attracting new audiences on YouTube. The best include a talking postbox, edible goldfish and a flower on a restaurant table that takes sly sips of diners’ drinks.

It didn’t always go well for Routh. Once, his target for a joke turned out to be a former heavyweight boxer — who gave him a black eye. Another time, preparing for a stunt near a bank, a passer-by thought Routh was acting suspiciously and dialled 999 to report a possible robbery in progress.

But the viewers loved it. At the peak of his fame Routh received 1,000 letters a week from members of the public suggesting new hoaxes to try out.

Actually, though, Sonia says, there was generally very little trouble and if  anything, people were only too anxious to help.

‘I
 had one that involved the film crew putting my car in a skip in the 
middle of the road, and I had to ask people to help me get it out.

‘I had an awful time trying to stop one man from calling the police.

‘Another time, I did have to be rescued by the camera crew.

‘I had proposed to a young man and, well, I think he took it a little bit too seriously.’

Rosemary Macvie —  78 years young, and currently starring in a play about the Spanish Inquisition, ‘which is rather more serious’ — admits she was a little  sceptical when she heard that her agent had put her up for the  job of being an Off Their  Rockers prankster.

She speaks with an even grander voice than Sonia, and says: ‘One generally doesn’t approach complete strangers in the street. It was terrifying. I am not a street entertainer. I actually lost 7lb during filming.’

Still, she sounds like quite a convert. Her favourite jape involved her sitting on a park bench in London and asking the occupant where the nearest Tube station was.

Learning curve: The programme may fall into the throwaway comedy category, but the actors say they were surprised at what they have learned about the younger generation

When he said ‘Bethnal Green’, she had to say: ‘I am so sorry, dear, I am a little hard of hearing, can you repeat that, slower?’

The poor man did this 43 times  before, to her astonishment, offering to take her there.

‘This was a chap I would have been afraid to speak to in real life. He had dreadlocks, tattoos and everything.

‘But he was so kind and helpful. By the end I loved him. I could have eaten him up!  

‘He got up and offered to walk me there, so I went with him and I just kept talking. I forgot all about supposedly being deaf.

‘I got away down the road before I remembered that the cameras were still going and I really better get back.’

Rosemary was constantly amazed at how kind, helpful and respectful members of the public were.

‘Not one person said “Silly old bat”, which I’m sure I would have done in their position.’

Star of the show, though, must be 76-year-old Seb Craig, who has the sort of face that screams character actor.

He’s worked up and down the country in repertory theatre, spending some time running venues, and is a veteran of 70 TV commercials.

'I'm just glad to be working at my age, and I hope to be doing so for many years to come'

Seb Craig

In his time he has flogged everything 
from spectacles (he’s in the current Specsavers ad) to nappies and Ragu 
sauce.

Like Sonia, he’s also a music video veteran, having starred 
alongside Annie Lennox.

Seb — who had a triple bypass a few years back brought on by ‘too many chocolate buttons’ during a stint in panto — says that it may seem like an unusual career choice, but ‘who cares?’

‘It’s just fun, isn’t it?’ he says. ‘I’ve been having a ball, getting out, meeting interesting people, making them laugh — eventually.

His favourite prank?

‘There is one when I am jogging past a pub and there are people sitting enjoying the sunshine outside, and I grab one of their pints on the way past and pour it over my head,’ he says.

‘My biggest surprise is that I haven’t been punched.’

He says the pranks involving mobile phones don’t take an awful lot of acting. ‘Because I can’t use them! They gave me an iPhone and I didn’t really know what to do with it. Every time I have to show someone something on the screen, it goes blank and I don’t know how to get it back.’

Some of the sketches can be a bit risqué, though. Is there anything he found too rude?

‘Well, there was one sketch that involved me going into a shop and asking to photocopy something, er, unusual. Yes, that.

‘I objected to a word they used. I said: “I can’t say that if children are watching.” So they changed it.’

The programme may fall into the throwaway comedy category, but all three actors say they were surprised at what they have learned about the younger generation.

‘All of the youngsters we have met have just been so sweet,’ says Rosemary.

‘It really does restore your faith in humanity. I certainly didn’t expect that.’
