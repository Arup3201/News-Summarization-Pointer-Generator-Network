National Front leader Marine Le Pen has confirmed that the party had borrowed £7 million in September from the Russian-owned First Czech-Russian Bank.

The Times reports Ms Le Pen as saying: 'We signed with the First (bank) who agreed and we're very happy about it.'

She insisted that it was 'ridiculous to suggest that gaining a loan would determine our international position'.

And added that the accusations were 'outrageous and offensive', and that her party had long held pro-Russian views.

Despite her comments the party's treasurer, Wallerand de Saint Just, admitted he would have preferred the party had chosen a French bank. 

According to the party the money was needed to prepare for the coming elections, leading up to the presidential campaign of 2017 in which Ms Le Pen would run.
