This spurned husband would have been served up a nasty shock along with his pint after his soon to be ex-wife announced she was divorcing him via a sign outside a bar

The angry woman persuaded staff at nightspot Noah's Yard in Swansea's Uplands district to put up the sign reading ‘Paul...I am divorcing you’ above the door.

Her statement was then followed up with a further message proclaiming: ‘BTW I am keeping the dog’.

Anger: The sign expressing her wife for a divorce was followed up with a statement revealing she was keeping the couple's dog

The wife, who wished to remain 
anonymous, went into Noah’s Yard — which has a history of changing the 
words on its sign — on Tuesday to ask for the sign to be put up at the 
weekend.

She said the reason behind her doing it was to name and shame her husband after finding out he allegedly had an affair.

'I was angry and upset so wanted a sign to go up for everyone to see,' she told the  South Wales Evening Post.

'When I found out I went through a mixture of emotions but felt angry and wanted him to pay.

'I had a drink in the bar on Tuesday and decided to get my own back.

'We have been married for years and it is so sad it has come to this.

Telling the world: The woman said she was angry and upset so wanted a sign to go up for everyone to see

'I am absolutely devastated and going through a really tough time at the moment.

'A lot of my friends and family have seen it and have been supporting me.

'I did feel a bit better once the sign went up. I wanted to name and shame him.'

The wife said she had messaged Paul to tell him to go read the sign and he was furious when he saw it.

However, neighbours have backed the woman's efforts to get her own back.

Linda
 Davies, who lives close to the bar, said: 'Good on her. If my husband 
ever cheated on me then I would string him up by his privates.

'Maybe he thought he could get away with sleeping around but I bet he is regretting it now.'

Passerby Ron Williams said it would keep a lot of men in the area on their toes.

He said: 'I would be mortified if that ever happened to me.

New beginnings: Bar owner Noah Redfern said the drinking spot has had a lot of unusual messages displayed on the building before, but this statement was definitely a first

'This could give a lot of wives in the city an idea - I'm guessing there will be a few nervous husbands walking down the street today.'

Noah’s Yard changes the words on its sign on a regular basis, often displaying statements such as 'Go Wales' for rugby matches.

The bar once had a romantic proposal emblazoned above the entrance, coincidentally reading 'Marry Me Paul', although it was no known if the same woman was behind the sign.

It also supported the city of culture campaign by 
emblazoning the campaign logo on its premises.

Noah Redfern, owner of Noah’s Yard, said they have had a lot of unusual messages displayed on their building before — but this was definitely a first.

He said: 'Maybe this will become a new way of asking for a divorce.

'We have had a lot of interest in it and all weekend customers have been asking about the story behind the sign.'
