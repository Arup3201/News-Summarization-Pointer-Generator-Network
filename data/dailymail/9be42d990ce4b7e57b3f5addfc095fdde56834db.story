Australian senator Cory Bernardi, who said legalising gay marriage would spark calls to legalise bestiality, is attending a conference of young Conservatives in Britain

The Conservatives today sought to distance themselves from an Australian MP linked gay marriage to bestiality as he prepares to attend a Conservative conference in the UK this weekend.

Liberal senator Cory Bernardi is flying into London after claiming legalising gay marriage could trigger demands for bestiality and polygamy to be legalised as well.

He is due to attend the European Young Conservative Freedom Summit in Oxford this weekend, according to The Australian newspaper.

Labour said his appearance at the event was 'astonishing' and accused the Tories of paying 'lip service' to equality.

But Conservative HQ has moved to play down his links to the party.

A party spokesman said: 'We haven't organised this event and are not in control of who attends.

'We strongly condemn Mr Bernardi's comments which don't reflect David Cameron's or the Conservative party's viewpoint in any way.'

Mr Bernardi was forced to resign as Bernardi has resigned as parliamentary secretary to opposition leader Tony Abbott are sparking a furore with his comments during a debate on same sex marriage.

Mr Bernardi said if same sex couples were allowed to tie the knot in Australian, it would lead to more extreme demands.

‘The next step ... is having three people that love each other be able to enter into a permanent union endorsed by society, or four people,’ he said.

‘There are even some creepy people out there, who say that it's OK to have consensual sexual relations between humans and animals. Will that be a future step?’

Mr Abbott said Senator Bernardi had made ‘ill-disciplined remarks’ and then repeated them on the radio. He had made ‘one mistake too many’.

The European Young Conservative Freedom Summit is being held at St Hugh's College, Oxford from Friday to Sunday.

ConservativeFuture, the youth wing of the British Conservative party for under-30s, has urged young Tories to attend, saying: 'This is your chance to join us at the leading conference for young conservatives of its kind in Europe.'

Mr Bernardi’s arrival in the UK comes at a sensitive time when the British Conservative party is split over plans to legalise gay marriage.

Former Labour Cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw said: 'It's astonishing that a youth wing of the Conservative Party could invite someone who has compared same sex marriage to bestiality to speak at one of their events.

'David Cameron should stop this appearance and make it clear that views like this have no place in his party.

'It's clear that while the Tories may pay lip-service to equality, too many of their supporters are prepared to endorse outrageous and offensive views like this.'

David Cameron was applauded by the Tory party conference last year when he urged them to back the change in the law.

‘I don’t support gay marriage in spite of being a Conservative,’ he said. ‘I support gay marriage because I am a Conservative.’

However, a number of senior Tory backbenchers have voiced opposition to the plans.
