The most controversial movie of 2014 could soon be in your movie queue.

Netflix announced yesterday it will make The Interview available on demand for its U.S. and Canada customers at no additional charge starting on January 24. 

The comedy about a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un was previously made available to stream on Google Play, Xbox, YouTube and AppleTV for a fee after its wide theatrical release was canceled in the wake of the Sony hacking scandal.

Netflix will make satirical comedy The Interview available on demand for US and Canada customers at no additional charge starting on January 24

The film, starring Seth Rogen and James Franco as two journalists involved in a CIA plot to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, was at the center of the Sony hacking scandal last month

Over the summer, the rogue state warned that the film's release would be an 'act of war that we will never tolerate' and said the U.S. will face 'merciless' retaliation.

Sony pulled the planned Christmas Day wide-release of the film after hackers threatened 9/11-like terror attacks on cinemas showing the comedy.

But it partially reversed the decision after the intervention of President Obama, allowing a limited release and making it available via video on demand. 

Neflix's chief content officer Ted Sarandos previously told television reporters the company was eager to deliver the film to customers during the semi-annual Television Critics Association press tour earlier this month.

Mr Sarandos said the 'eye-opening' film was a 'great example of what could happen with a big-budget movie if you give people distribution choices, even limited distribution choices.'

'You can actually create a lot of revenue.' 

The film's depiction of the leader  (played here by actor Randall Park) angered North Korea. The country warned the film's release would be an 'act of war that we will never tolerate' and said the U.S. will face 'merciless' retaliation

In a statement, Netflix said it was 'thrilled to offer exclusively the controversial comedy to our U.S. and Canadian members just 30 days after it debuted in theaters and pay-per-view.'

Netflix's announcement, which came as part of the company's fourth-quarter earnings release, was made on the same day Sony Pictures reported the film has grossed more than $40million in rentals and sales.

It has also made around $6million domestically in its limited theatrical release. 

Last month Sony was targeted by a group of hackers that called themselves The Guardians of Peace, who released a number of company emails from top executives.

Government officials revealed that North Korea was behind the hack on the movie studio, although North Korea continues to deny any involvement.

Sony originally announced it would not release the film at all after the terrorist threats, a decision that came after the five largest theater chains in North America announced they would no longer show it.

Neflix's chief content officer Ted Sarandos said the 'eye-opening' film proved companies could create a lot of revenue by giving the public multiple distribution choices 

Many in Hollywood voiced their concern, with writer Aaron Sorkin saying how upset he was that 'the U.S. succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished, bedrock principle of free speech by a group of North Korean terrorists.'

Actor Robe Lowe wrote that the move was 'an utter and complete victory' for the hackers.

But it wasn't until President Obama spoke out that the company changed it's mind. 

During his end-of-year press conference, the president said Sony made a crucial error in self-censoring after a North Korean cyber attack.  

'We cannot have a policy where some dictator somewhere can start imposing censorship here in the United States,' he said. 

The president then called out Kim Jong-Un, adding 'it says something about North Korea that its leaders thought a comedic movie posed a danger to their iron-fisted rule'.

The real Kim in a mushroom factory. Sony is both the first studio to release a major motion picture online and the first to simultaneously allow for the viewing of a film across three different platforms

'The notion that that was a threat to them?' he asked. 'I think that gives you some kind of sense of what kind of regime we're talking about here.' 

In a matter of days Sony made the film available for limited theatrical release on its original Christmas Day premiere date as well as online and via video on demand.

At the time of its release, company CEO Michael Lynton said: 'While we hope this is only the first step of the film's release, we are proud to make it available to the public and to have stood up to those who attempted to suppress free speech.' 

The public responded with a massive outpouring of support for the film. Thousands turned out for Christmas Eve midnight screenings across the country and tens of thousands of Americans streamed the film online.

Sony has now gone down it history for becoming the first studio to release a major motion picture online, as well as being the first studio to simultaneously allow for the viewing of a film across three different platforms.
