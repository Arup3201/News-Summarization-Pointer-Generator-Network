The judge in the divorce case between New York City banker Sage Kelly and his ex-wife Christina has called their trial a 'fiasco.'

Justice Matthew Cooper said that the pair's behavior was 'horrible,' and that he felt bad for their 'innocent children.'

This as Sage Kelly, a $7 million-a-year Manhattan banker who worked at Jefferies & Co., recently settled with his wife Christina for an undisclosed amount of money.

The settlement also includes joint custody of the couples two daughters, 10-year-old Cameron and 6-year-old Logan.

Moving on: Sage Kelly has settled his divorce with wife Christina (above with their two daughters) out of court for a very pricey, and undisclosed, sum

Reunited: As past of the settlement agreement, the couple will share joint custody of their two daughters (above)

'This ended up as horrible as it can be for Mr. Kelly and I guess to some extent for Ms. Kelly, but most of all for the children,' Cooper said, according to the New York Post. 

Sage's lifestyle became very public knowledge in October when Christina’s 26-page affidavit in their divorce was made public, which described in detail her husband's alleged cocaine use and sexual hijinks. 

At one point Christina, 39, graphically detailed a cocaine-fueled foursome she and Sage had with the head of Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Marc Beer, and his girlfriend at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston.

Christina said Sage wanted her involved to get Beer's business for his company, and that she engaged with both Beer and his girlfriend in sexual activity.

Battling spouses: Christina counter-sued Sage in August of this year after he won full custody of their daughters when he filmed her doing cocaine in the Manhattan apartment

Revenge affidavit: Christina filed a 26-page affidavit accusing her husband of sexual promiscuity and rampant drug use 

Getting dragged in: Christina claimed she and Sage had a cocaine-fuled foursome with pharemcutical big wig Marc Beer (left) and his girlfriend, and that Sage's boss at Jefferies, Ben Lorello (right), used cocaine

In her affidavit Christina also claims that Sage slept with the wife of a coworker while her husband was sleeping in their guest bedroom and that he hosted a Mushroom Day at their swanky Sag Harbor vacation home, where guests all ingested the hallucinogenic fungi.

Christina also accused a number of Sage's friends, including his boss at Jefferies, Ben Lorello, of using cocaine. 

Sage, 42, who has denied all of his wife's allegations, would not comment on the divorce settlement. 

He did previously admit that he and his wife had used drugs 'at certain social events in the past,'  but stated 'the Wolf of Wall Street tale [Christina] tells this court is a work of fiction.'

Christina has had her own problems with the law, having been caught on video inside the couple's house doing cocaine just this past July and being charged with felony DWI and endangering the welfare of a child after she crashed her Range Rover into a telephone pole in May 2010 while her two young daughters were in the backseat.

Shattered past: Christina admits now that she has a drug and alcohol problem that she is working on, having been charged with DWI in 2010 (mugshot on left) while he daughters were in the car, while Sage claims his wife's affidavit is a work of 'fiction'

Because of this, Sage won custody of their two daughters, which led his wife to counter-sue and her affidavit to become public. 

Now it seems that both parties are ready to move on and enjoy a more private life.

Said Christina, 'I’d like to put this behind us and move forward with a new chapter in my life as Christina di Mauro.' 

A source close to the case also revealed that Christina said in a statement that Sage is 'a great father who greatly loves our children' and that the two are 'both fully committed to co-parenting our children.'

Christina also apologized to those who had been affected by this very public battle, specifically 'those at Jefferies and those associated with Jefferies.'

She also said this 'amicable' settlement 'ensures loving homes for our children.'
