This video captures the moment a bouncer says gay people should be fed to dogs after a clubber claimed to have been beaten by a nightclub worker.

Rory Barker says the homophobic slur came after a staff member hit him and then threw him out of the one of the biggest clubs in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, in the early hours of Saturday.

Police are investigating after the video emerged online appearing to support Mr Barker's claim.

Police are investigating after a video captured the moment a bouncer says gay people should be fed to dogs

The clip shows a bouncer at the Corporation club telling another reveller: 'If you want to take a gay man home, you can feed him to your dogs.'

Mr Barker, a chemistry student at the University of Sheffield, told student newspaper The Tab: 'It was like being in a boxing match.

'I ended up having to cover my face as he tried to upper cut me, and got punched in the side instead.

'I was then escorted outside where we asked the bouncers if they thought their colleague's behaviour was ok, and they responded by telling us to f*** off.'

Corporation club said this type of behaviour is 'unacceptable' and suspended a member of their door team 

He added: 'I was then asked by one of them if I was a gay boy, and when I replied 'no, not that it matters', they replied 'are you sure? You look like a slimy little gay'.'

He added: 'I was too astonished and incredulous to their open homophobic comments to feel angry or embarrassed.'

Fellow revellers said the incident inside the club was sparked when a staff member grabbed Mr Barker's friend Jess Keane during an argument with another clubber.

John Pinkos, who was with the group, said: 'He suddenly grabbed Jess's arm really hard, to the point where she dropped her phone.  

'To me, a grown man trying to intimidate a five foot five girl is shameful.'

Ms Keane added: 'Rory stepped in to get me away from the bouncer where he then took a punch to the face.' 

Corporation nightclub said they had suspended a member of their door team yesterday.

A spokesman for the club wrote on their Facebook page that the behaviour is 'totally unacceptable' and the incident is being investigated.

'Regarding the comments made by a member of security on Fri 20th Feb, the person concerned has been immediately suspended following initial investigations,' he said.

'This type of behaviour is totally unacceptable by all here at Corporation.

'We pride ourselves as a venue that does not discriminate against any group, regardless of creed, colour or orientation.'

South Yorkshire Police confirmed an investigation was taking place.

They said: 'Police are investigating reports of abusive comments made towards an individual outside Corporation nightclub in Milton Street, Sheffield.

'The incident is believed to have taken place at around 1.30am on Saturday 21 February.'
