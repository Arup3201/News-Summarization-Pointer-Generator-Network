A University of Wisconsin drop-out was found guilty of strangling his thespian ex-girlfriend to death after failing to rekindle their romance.

It took the Washington County jury less than four hours on Tuesday to convict 20-year-old Daniel Bartelt in July 2013 death of Jessie Blodgett, 19.

Blodgett's mother discovered her dead body just hours after the teen returned from a cast party for a production of 'Fiddler at the Roof'.

Bartelt and Blodgett met while attending Hartford Union High School, where they both acted in school productions. The two dated while in high school, and even recorded a song they posted to YouTube.

Guilty: University of Wisconsin drop-out Daniel Bartelt was found guilty on Tuesday of murdering his ex-girlfriend Jessie Blodgett last summer. Above, Bartelt in court on Tuesday

Former flame: Baretelt and Blodgett (pictured) dated in high school. At the time of her death, Blodgett was a student at the University of Wisconsin and acting in a production of 'Fiddler on the Roof'

However, the two broke up, and both went on to study at the University of Wisconsin. Bartlet dropped out of the Steven's Point campus after just one semester, returning home depressed.

The two were rekindling their friendship the following summer when Blodgett was killed. At the time, Huffington Post reported that Bartelt wanted to be more than just friends.

The last time Blodgett was seen, she was leaving a cast party for a production of 'Fiddler on the Roof' around 1am on July 15, 2013.

That afternoon, her mother went into her bedroom where she found her daughter strangled to death and made a frantic call to 911.

An autopsy ruled Blodgett died from strangulation, since there were ligature marks on her neck and arm.

During this week's trial, it was revealed that Bartelt used climbing rope to carry out the murder, and his fingerprints were found on a roll of tape discovered under Blodgett's bed. 

The 20-year-old's DNA was also found under Blodgett's fingernails and in her genital area, suggesting sexual assault.

The rope, antiseptic wipes and bloody paper towels were found stuffed in a cereal box that was dumped in nearby Hartford Park after the murder, and the DNA was a match again.

'She's screaming at us and telling 
us through her body and through her DNA what happened to her,' District Attorney Mark Benson said in his closing arguments on Tuesday.

After the Tuesday decision, Bartelt was remanded to prison while Blodgett's father made a statement saying 'nobody won today'.

'Dan’s family is a beautiful family that provided a loving 
environment. They’re great people. I feel horrible for them, today. It’s
 a huge loss for everybody,” Buck Blodgett told reporters outside the court room, 

The jury found Bartelt guilty of first-degree intentional homicide.

He also faced charges of  first degree recklessly endangering safety and false imprisonment, for a separate assault.

After his arrest last summer, Bartelt also admitted to attacking another woman just three days before Blodgett's death.

The assault happened in Richfield Park on July 12 when Bartelt attacked a 
woman just hours after researching serial killers online.

The victim said he tackled her to the ground and she believed she was 'going to die' when she luckily wrestled the knife away.

She held the knife at him and then escaped by driving off in her car. She needed 15 stitches after the incident.

Bartelt told police that it was 'a spur of the moment decision...to scare her'.

But
 it appears Bartelt planned the attack since he made some disturbing 
internet searches on serial killers just 30 minutes before.

Sentencing is scheduled for October 14, and Bartelt faces a maximum of life in prison.

His attorney says he was disappointed with Tuesday's decision and that they plan to appeal after sentencing.
