Double-star systems - like Tattooine in Star Wars - are surprisingly common - but scientists have found some that break the laws of physics.

The twin red dwarf stars in four systems recently detected orbit round one another in tight circles that should not be possible - instead, the stars should 'mash together' into one larger star.

Dr Bas Nefs, of the Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands, said: ‘To our complete surprise, we found 
‘It means that we have to rethink how these close in binaries form and evolve.’

The 'red dwarfs', which are up to ten times smaller and a thousand times less bright than the Sun, are the fastest moving such stellar partners in the Milky Way.

It was always believed if binary stars form too close to each other, they would quickly mush together into one single, bigger one.

This was in line with many observations taken over the last three decades showing the abundant population of stellar binaries, but none with orbital periods shorter than five hours.

His team used the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) on Hawaii to track the red dwarfs which are described in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

About half the stars in the galaxy are, unlike our Sun, part of a binary system in which two stars orbit each other.

Most likely, these were formed close together and have been in orbit around each other from birth onwards.

Although they form the most common type of star in the Milky Way, red dwarfs do not show up in normal surveys because of their dimness in visible light.

For the last five years, UKIRT has been monitoring the brightness of hundreds of thousands of stars, including thousands of red dwarfs, in near-infrared light, using its state-of-the-art Wide-Field Camera (WFC).

Since stars shrink in size early in their lifetime, the fact that these very tight binaries exist means that their orbits must also have shrunk as well since their birth, otherwise the stars would have been in contact early on and have merged.

Co researcher Professor David Pinfield, of the University of Hertfordshire, added: ‘Without UKIRT's superb sensitivity, it would not have been possible to find these extraordinary pairs of red dwarfs.‘The active nature of these stars and their apparently powerful magnetic fields has profound implications for the environments around red dwarfs throughout our galaxy.’
