Labour is under intense pressure to allow watchdogs in to inspect the second-class health service in Wales.

It follows the Daily Mail’s investigation into allegations of appalling care, long waiting lists and limited access to lifesaving treatments on the Welsh NHS.

The issue sparked controversy at Westminster yesterday, with Jeremy Hunt warning there was ‘absolutely intolerable pressure’ on hospitals on the England-Wales border as thousands of patients flee the Labour-run health service.

The Health Secretary told MPs: 'The NHS is happy to treat more Welsh patients, but the trouble is they aren’t prepared to pay for it, and that’s why Welsh patients get a second-class health service'

‘For every one English patient that is admitted for treatment in a Welsh hospital, five Welsh patients are admitted for treatment in an English hospital,’ the Health Secretary told MPs.

‘I have written to the Welsh health minister to say the NHS is happy to treat more Welsh patients, but the trouble is they aren’t prepared to pay for it, and that’s why Welsh patients get a second-class health service.’

There were angry exchanges between the Government and the Labour administration in Wales over a planned study of the health services in the four nations of the UK.

Ministers accused Welsh health minister Mark Drakeford of blocking the visit of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.

The watchdog, which conducts audits of public services across the developing world, wants to conduct a comparative study of UK health services.

Mr Drakeford wrote to Mr Hunt accusing him of ‘a tissue of lies’ about the state of the Welsh health service, adding: ‘The NHS in Wales will not be the victim of any Conservative Party ploy to drag its reputation through the mud for entirely partisan purposes.’

Mr Hunt insisted the Welsh government had given written agreement to take part in the study, insisting in a letter to Mr Drakeford, seen by the Mail: ‘On a matter as important as this, I do not agree with you that their findings should be withheld from the public.

'You claim repeatedly that the NHS in Wales is not performing worse than the NHS in England – in which case you have nothing to fear.’

A Welsh government source insisted an OECD investigation ‘absolutely will’ go ahead at some point and accused Mr Hunt of ‘moving the goalposts’. In Cardiff, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said patients had ‘genuine concerns’.

She demanded to know why more than 40 per cent of patients in Wales waited over six weeks for an MRI scan – in England and Scotland it was 6 per cent and 2 per cent respectively.

In the Commons Stephen Mosley, Tory MP for Chester, raised concerns about the strains placed on health care in his constituency by patients from Wales.

Asked by Tory MP for Monmouth David Davies how many patients who live in England had written to him to request treatment in Wales, Mr Hunt said: ‘Given the perilous state in Labour-run Wales, you will not be surprised to know that not a single English patient has written.’

In the Welsh Assembly, Labour’s first minister Carwyn Jones accused critics of ‘playing politics with people’s health’. ‘I don’t pretend in any way that the health service in Wales is perfect, but it’s not in England,’ he said.

A Welsh government spokesman said: ‘Some Welsh patients, especially those who live close to the English border, will find it easier and quicker to access routine NHS hospital services in England because they are closer to their homes.'
