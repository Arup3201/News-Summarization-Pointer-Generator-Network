A young woman whose family mistakenly believed she had died in a car crash married in the same church where hundreds once mourned at her funeral.

The family of Whitney Cerak, 25, initially believed she had been one of five victims killed when their mini-van was struck by a tractor in 2006.

Another family kept a 24-hour vigil around Miss Cerak, believing it was their daughter Laura VanRyn due to the extent of the young woman's injuries following the collision in Indiana.

Second chance: Whitney Cerak, 25, with her husband Matt whom she married after surviving a horrific car crash in Indiana

Happiness: Whitney Cerak married at the church where her family once held her funeral after a case of mistaken identity meant they believed she had died

The two teenagers both had blonde hair and were around the same height. The young woman who survived suffered facial swelling, broken bones and cuts and bruises, and was in a neck brace.

Several weeks after the crash, Miss Cerak's family held a funeral for her which was attended by hundreds of friends and family.

Then, five weeks after the crash, the sister of 22-year-old Laura VanRyn noticed that her sibling's teeth looked different  - and the horrifying mistake was discovered.

Six years on, the Cerak and VanRyn families remain incredibly close after the tragedy where one lost a daughter and the other survived. Whitney told the Today show: 'I love the VanRyn family.'

Miracle: Whitney, with her parents Colleen and Newell and husband Matt Wheeler (left) remember the traumatic accident six years ago

Whitney, now 25, went on to marry her boyfriend Matt Wheeler, who had helped her recover from the accident. The couple wed in the same church in Gaylord, Indiana where the Cerak family once held her funeral.

Four weeks ago, Mrs Wheeler gave birth to the couple's first son Zachary Thomas. 

There is yet another challenge for the family to face - Mr Wheeler serves in the U.S. army and is due to deploy to Afghanistan in two weeks. 

Whitney said: 'This will be a whole different level of hard.'

She plans to move in her with parents so they can spend more time with their grandson while her husband Matt is overseas for around nine months.

In the 2006 accident, four students and an employee were killed when their van was struck by a tractor-trailer that had drifted across the highway. Taylor University, is an evangelical Christian college in Upland, Indiana.

Those in the van worked for Taylor's dining services and were preparing for a banquet for the inauguration of a new president of the 1,850-student school.

On their blog at the time, the VanRyns wrote: 'Our hearts are aching as we have learned that the young woman we have been taking care of over the past five weeks has not been our dear Laura, but instead a fellow Taylor student of hers, Whitney Cerak.'

Cerak's grandfather, Emil Frank, described getting his granddaughter back as 'like a fairy tale'.

Eerie: The gravestone of Whitney Cerak was laid following her funeral despite the fact she was alive and injured in an Indiana hospital

Mistaken identity: Whitney Cerak was so badly injured after the crash that the VanRyn family believed it was their daughter Laura for five weeks
