The first cream to treat erectile dysfunction is now available on prescription in the UK, giving hope to those unable to take Viagra and other treatments.

The new cream, called Vitaros, comes in a single use, disposable applicator and is suitable for the 2.3million men over the age of 18 facing sexual function problems.

The pre-prescribed amount of cream is applied to the tip of the penis, and once absorbed into the skin claims to produce an erection within five to 30 minutes.

Men in the UK are the first in the world to have access to the new cream, which contains the drug alprostadil.

Oral drugs are also often not suitable for people with angina or those who have had a stroke or a heart attack.

They may also cause a number of generalised side effects, such as severe headaches, blurred vision and dizziness.

In a recent survey of 250 men in the UK diagnosed with ED, 35 per cent suffered side effects from their taking a pill.

However the majority of those men, 68 per cent, continued with their treatment just so they can continue to achieve an erection.

As the cream is applied directly to the genitals these generalised side effects are considered unlikey, experts say.

They say any side effects from using Vitaros are localised to the site of application and tend to be mild and short-lived.

Dr David Edwards, a GP in Chipping 
Norton, and President of the British Society for Sexual Medicine, said: 
'The availabilty of Vitaros is an exciting milestone in erectile 
dysfunction treatment.

'Many
 men miss out on the chance of treatment because they either cannot 
tolerate a pill or simply do not want to take one, or are put off by the
 existing forms of alprostadil, such as an injection into the penis or a
 pellet inserted into the uretha.

'The importance of finding the right treatment for the right person cannot be underestimated.

The cream is only available on prescription and is self-administered after verbal instructions from a healthcare professional.

Many men suffering erectile dysfunction and prescribed oral treatment, such as Viagra, experience side effects including dizziness, severe headaches and blurred vision. Experts say the new cream is likely to have far fewer side effects

Many ED treatments, including Vitaros, are currently restricted on the NHS, meaning not all men will be deemed eligible for the treatment.

However those who do require treatment for ED but fall outside the requirements for a free NHS prescriptions may still be able to receive private prescriptions for the cream.

Erectile dysfunction is estimated to affect half of all men between the ages of 40 and 70 at some point.

In some cases the condition can lead to relationship issues, poor self-esteem, anxiety and depression, all of which can exacerbate the original problem.

Despite the negative impact ED can have on a man's life, another recent UK study revealed 80 per cent of the 250 men questioned had problems for longer than a year before seeking help.

Experts advise seeking help from a healthcare professional as ED can be an early warning sign for serious conditions such as cardiovascular disease, indicating a man could be at risk of angina or heart attack in the next three to five years.
