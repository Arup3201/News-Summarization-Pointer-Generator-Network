Germany manager Joachim Low was named the FIFA World Coach of the Year at Monday evening's Ballon d'Or ceremony in Zurich.

Low beat Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti and Atletico boss Diego Simeone to scoop the award having guided Germany to their fourth World Cup victory during last summer's tournament in Brazil.  

The 54-year-old helped end the country's eighteen-year wait for silverware as Germany beat Argentina in the World Cup final courtesy of Mario Gotze's extra-time strike.

Upon receiving the gong, Low said: 'This is a huge honour for me to receive this award after a hugely successful 2014. 

'This is the icing on the cake of the World Cup.

'This is not considered to me to be my property but I am just taking it on behalf of the others.' 

Ancelotti, who arrived at the ceremony with his wife Luisa, had been nominated after achieving 'La Decima' with Real Madrid.

In 2014, the Italian helped the Spanish giants win the Champions League, Copa del Rey, Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.

Simeone, meanwhile, guided Atletico Madrid to their first La Liga title in 18 years and also masterminded the club's route to last season's Champions League final in Lisbon.
