Kell Brook returned to a hero's welcome in Sheffield on Friday following his stunning IBF welterweight world title win.

Brook pulled off a stunning upset in Los Angeles to dethrone Shawn Porter and win the  title on Saturday night and was greeted at a civic reception in the Winter Garden to celebrate his win. 

The Sheffield star recovered from a slow start in to gradually impose himself on the unbeaten champion.

One judge scored the fight level but the other two marked it in Brook's favour, albeit by flattering margins of 117-111 and 116-112.

'It's been a long road to get to where I am today, Brook said. 'I've been in that gym since I was a nine-year-old. My feet haven't touched the ground yet, I'm still buzzing, bringing the world title back to Yorkshire, Sheffield.

'I'll be bringing massive fights back to Sheffield, you'll be seeing me with big, big names. It's all about the fans for me, exciting you. So I just want to thank you all, we have finally done it.

'I did what I needed to, I got out my comfort zone to travel to America. A lot of people wrote me off before the fight but I kept composed did what I needed to and I'm world champion.'

Brook was greeted by the Lord Mayor of Sheffield and Coun Peter Rippon at the Town Hall at lunchtime and also signed autographs for fans.

'I am so proud to be bringing the title back to Sheffield,” said Brook previously. 'The people have always supported me so passionately from day one, and I am sure that they all stayed up to see me win the title.'
