From the blonde locks and bulging muscles of South Africa's Chad Le Clos to handsome homegrown talent Matthew Jamieson, there's no shortage of good-looking chaps to choose from among the swimming fraternity.

But swimmers aren't the only ones currently brightening up the Commonwealth Games. Judo, rugby, hockey and athletics all boast a preponderance of attractive stars, among them Jamaica's Usain Bolt and Australia's Ed Jenkins.

Other competitors making waves for their looks as well as their sporting prowess include England's Greg Rutherford and Ashley McKenzie and Kenya's Biko Wolfgang Adema. Still not convinced? FEMAIL rounds up the handsome athletes worth switching on for:

Looking good: Along with a role on Celebrity Big Brother in September 2012, handsome Ashley McKenzie boasts a stellar judo career - and just took gold for England

MICHAEL JAMIESON, SCOTLAND, SWIMMING

25-year-old Jamieson, from Glasgow, might have missed out on a gold medal during last night's 200m breaststroke final but he did at least manage a well-earned silver to add to his already impressive medal collection.

And its not just his prowess in the pool that has made the Olympic and Commonwealth silver medallist so popular: With his dark hair and honed torso, the swimmer, who is currently based in Bath, has proved a hit with the ladies as well.

ASHLEY MCKENZIE, ENGLAND, JUDO

The newly crowned Commonwealth judo champion, Ashley McKenzie is arguably the best known member of Team GB's judo stars - thanks, in part, to a stint on Celebrity Big Brother, where he managed a respectable fifth place.

When not starring in reality TV shows, the 25-year-old athlete has been making waves in the world of judo and is currently number one in Europe, although unfortunately, he failed to make it past the second round during the London 2012 Olympics. His Commonwealth Games win (and extremely good looks) suggest he's one to watch.

BIKO WOLFGANG ADEMA, KENYA, RUGBY SEVENS

Strapping
 Biko Wolfgang Adema, 26, is one of Kenya's hottest rugby stars and has 
been playing the game since being introduced to it by his older brother 
at primary school.

Although
 Kenya isn't a medal favourite, Adema, who says his motto is 'never give
 up' has other ideas and hopes to fly home to Nairobi with a medal. Tune
 in tomorrow for his first outing at Glasgow 2014 - in a group match 
against the Cook Islands.

USAIN BOLT, JAMAICA, ATHLETICS

The world's fastest man hardly needs introducing, having swept all before him - both on and off the track - since exploding onto the scene during the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

Since then, he's gone on to win just about every race he's entered and the hearts of women worldwide - most notably those of the Swedish handball team during London 2012.

Although Bolt is rumoured to have begun dating a fellow Jamaican, the sprinter has remained uncharacteristically quiet about his alleged new relationship, begun following a split from his British former girlfriend Megan Edwards in December 2013.

Narrow miss: Jamieson was narrowly beaten into second place during last night's 200m breaststroke by compatriot Ross Murdoch, 20

Hunky: Biko Wolfgang Adema hopes he and his teammates will triumph in the rugby sevens at Glasgow 2014. Kenya's first match is against the Cook Islands tomorrow

Legend:
 The world's fastest man is almost as famous for his good looks as he is
 for being as fast as lightening. Bolt is one of the Commonwealth Games'
 biggest stars

COREY MAIN, NEW ZEALAND, SWIMMING

One of the youngest competitors at Glasgow 2014, New Zealand's Corey Main, 19, is also one of the best looking. The New Zealand swimmer is among the young talent tipped for the top at this year's Games, in his case in the 100m backstroke.

The Aucklander will face some stiff competition in order to triumph however, with defending champion, England's Liam Tancock, and Australia's Mitchell Larkin among those to beat.

ED JENKINS, AUSTRALIA, RUGBY SEVENS

At 6ft 2" tall and weighing in at nearly 15st, handsome rugby sevens star Ed Jenkins, 28, is a formidable opponent for any team taking on the Wallabies - as is his identical twin brother, Super Rugby star Jono Jenkins.

Currently the vice-captain of Australia's sevens side, Jenkins (and his compatriots) are convinced that this could be the year that the team take home a Commonwealth gold. They will, however, have to get past the equally impressive England and New Zealand to do it.

Double trouble: Woburn Sands' star Greg Rutherford is expecting a baby with his girlfriend while Australia sevens star Ed Jenkins has an identical twin brother

Yellow peril: Ed is the Wallabies vice captain and has high hopes of taking home a Commonwealth gold - if he and his men can beat favourites, England and New Zealand

GREG RUTHERFORD, ENGLAND, ATHLETICS

The
 man from Woburn Sands is only the second British long jumper to take 
Olympic gold - and boasts fiery good looks that are almost as impressive
 as his sporting achievements.

Sadly
 for those with lingering hopes of impressing the England and GB 
athlete, Rutherford, 27, announced in April that he and his girlfriend 
Susie Verrill are expecting their first child together.

CHAD LE CLOS, SOUTH AFRICA, SWIMMING

The man with the most famous sporting dad on the planet, South Africa's Chad le Clos, 22, shot to fame during the London 2012 Olympics when he unexpectedly beat US swimmer Michael Phelps to take gold in the 200m butterfly.

Father Bert's ecstatic reaction - and hilarious follow-up interview with Clare Balding - made stars of both father and son, although Chad's blonde good looks certainly helped to get the ladies on side.

Top dad: While son Chad was winning medals in the pool, his father Bert stole the hearts of the nation thanks to his enthusiastic celebrations and hilarious interview

SEAN LAMONT, SCOTLAND, RUGBY SEVENS

One of Scotland's most accomplished rugby stars, 33-year-old Sean Lamont is among those taking to the field for the home team - much to the delight of local ladies enchanted with his dark good looks.

When he's not running out for the rugby sevens squad, the man from Perth spends his time playing rugby union, currently for local side the Glasgow Warriors following stints at Rotherham and the Northampton Saints/

LOUIS SMITH, ENGLAND, GYMNASTICS

The Olympic bronze medallist and Strictly Come Dancing winner barely requires an introduction. But things haven't been easy for Smith, 25, since the giddy heights of 2012 with the gymnast spending much of 2013 battling depression.

Making his competitive comeback following an enforced career break, the man from Peterborough hopes to make a splash when he takes to the floor - despite having only gone back into training in January.

Gorgeous: Handsome Scottish rugby star Sean Lamont and his men will have to see off England, Australia and New Zealand if they want to take rugby sevens gold
