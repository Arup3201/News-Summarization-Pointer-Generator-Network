An Italian journalist and a writer from Belgium have been freed after being kidnapped in Syria five months ago.

Domenico Quirico and Pierre Piccinin da Prata were kidnapped while working in the war torn country back in April.

Quirico, a veteran reporter for La Stampa daily with vast experience of reporting on conflicts in Africa and the Middle East, entered Syria on April 6 but disappeared four days later.

He was embraced by the Italian foreign minister and looked weary as he arrived back in Rome last night.

He spoke briefly by phone to his wife in June confirming he had been kidnapped but said he was in good health.

'We never lost hope and all the efforts made over the past months have been crowned with success,' Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta said in a statement confirming both men had been released and were on their way to Italy.

Mr Quirico was met by Italian Foreign minister Emma Bonino on the tarmac as he landed at a military airport just outside Rome last night.

Quirico, looking weary, told reporters on the tarmac of Rome's Ciampino airport that he felt as if 'he had been living on Mars' for the last five months, and that his isolation from the news was such that he didn't even know who had been elected Italian president this spring.

'I was treated badly,' Quirico said, when a reporter asked about his time in captivity.

The news was confirmed in a tweet by Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo who said he shared the emotion and relief of the men's families.

There was no immediate word on who was responsible for kidnapping the two men, who were reported to have been travelling together when they were taken.

Their release comes amid growing international tensions over the civil war in Syria, which has cost an estimated 100,000 lives.

President Bashar al-Assad is accused by many western countries of using chemical weapons, and the United States and France are considering military action in response.

Italy has condemned the government in Damascus, which denies using the banned weapons, but has refused to join military action without a clear mandate from the United Nations.

America last night refused to rule out seeking a United Nations resolution for action in Syria, potentially delaying any air strikes even further.

Despite tough talk from the White House about the pressing need to prevent further atrocities, US Secretary of State John Kerry suggested the UN route was still open and ‘no decision has been made’.

Four other Italian journalists were kidnapped in Syria in April but were released after little more than a week.
