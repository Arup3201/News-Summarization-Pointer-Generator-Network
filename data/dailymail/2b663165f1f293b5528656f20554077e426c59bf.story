Some would call it vanity. Others would say it shows a healthy degree of self-confidence.

But whatever the reason, Britons are hooked on taking photos of themselves. In fact a survey claims we take 35million ‘selfies’ every month.

More than 50 per cent admit snapping themselves with their mobile phones and cameras. A quarter of those even admit to taking a sexy selfie, but 36 per cent later regret it.

Three-quarters of young people aged between 18 and 24 admit taking selfies, the study by mobile phone company HTC found.

But the trend isn’t limited to the young. Twenty nine per cent, of those aged over 65 also take selfies.

The new craze, which involves posing by yourself before taking a picture, has risen in popularity, with over one million selfies taken every day.

A number of celebrities pose for their own cameras and post the pictures on social networking websites and have made the craze boom.

The new research, carried out by mobile phone company HTC, reveals a list of the top celebrities who take selfies and put them on the internet.

Pop star Rihanna, 25, was voted the best celebrity selfie-taker, followed by 33-year-old Kelly Brook and television personality Kim Kardashian, 32.

More than a third (35 per cent) do so to remember a happy moment and the top place to take selfies is on holiday (19 per cent).

Georgia Jones, a student from Winchester, Hants, admits taking photos of herself on a regular basis.

The 21-year-old said: 'I’m constantly taking selfies on my smartphone and uploading them on my Facebook page.

'I normally do it before a night out and especially when I’m on holiday.

'It’s a great way to have a decent photo of yourself and I think selfies are perfect to use for a profile picture on Facebook and Twitter.'

Suzi Watson, from HTC, reveals how the rise in popularity of taking selfies could see the word enter the English dictionary.

She said: '2013 has definitely been the year of the selfie. Consumer interest and technology has created a perfect storm for this to continue.

'It’s not just about vanity, but it’s about sharing with friends and family, the most popular places to take a selfie is on holiday and the most popular place to share it is on Facebook.

'So although "selfie" did not make it into the Oxford English Dictionary this year, I would be surprised if it is not included next year.

'Their appeal comes from how easy they are to create and share, all with the camera technology in our pockets.'
