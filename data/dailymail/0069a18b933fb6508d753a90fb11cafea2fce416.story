Ally McCoist expressed his delight at having Lewis Macleod available to face Alloa on Saturday– after Gordon Strachan agreed to temporarily excuse the player from Scotland duty.

With Rangers’ Championship match with the Wasps going ahead in the middle of an international break, McCoist asked the national team boss to temporarily ‘loan’ the midfielder back to him – provided he wasn’t central to his plans for last night’s game with Ireland.

With Hearts’ lead at the top of the table just four points, McCoist’s men have the chance to briefly cut that to a single point by virtue of the Gorgie side’s late kick-off at Falkirk.

And the Ibrox manager feels having Macleod in his ranks heightens his side’s chances of ramping up the pressure on Robbie Neilson’s team ahead of next week’s capital showdown.

‘Lewis trained with us this morning and is in our squad for tomorrow,’ McCoist said on Friday. ‘I had a chat with Gordon. He has been pleased with Lewis and his contribution, but thankfully he’s in agreement that we’d like him to get a game at the weekend. I think he has a chance of being in our squad!

‘It’s safe to say he is in the Scotland squad for a reason, and the reason is that he has been doing well.

‘We are delighted he’s back in the squad because we want all our best players available. On current form, Lewis is certainly one of them.

‘I would imagine he would join back up with the Scotland squad on the Sunday (ahead of Tuesday’s game with England). I spoke to him and he has thoroughly enjoyed it.’

The next seven days promise to be pivotal as far as the race for the second tier’s one automatic promotion spot is concerned.

But while acknowledging many minds are already drifting towards next weekend’s first-versus-second clash at Tynecastle, McCoist sees Saturday's scheduling as a prime chance to crank up the pressure on the league leaders.

Speaking after rival Neilson insisted this week that he doesn’t look out for Rangers’ results, McCoist said: ‘I can’t speak for the Hearts players, but I can tell you - because there is no point lying - that I look for the Hearts result, the Hibs result, every result. That’s my job.

'But if they don’t look for our result, then fair enough, that’s up to them. I’d be staggered if our boys didn’t look for the Hearts and Hibs results because that’s part and parcel of football.’

Next week’s contest may briefly take the limelight away from the League Cup semi-final with Celtic in early February but a first meeting with the Parkhead men in three years is likely to hog the agenda thereafter.

As if the Old Firm game doesn’t have enough sub-plots already, the fact it’s due to take place immediately after the closure of the January transfer window is another intriguing aspect.

But McCoist insists his New Year wish list - in terms of players coming and going - will be motivated solely by his club’s long-term recovery as opposed to the chance to record a one-off famous victory over their ancient rivals.

In a League Cup tie, Rangers will face Celtic for the first time since April 2012 when they lost 3-0 at Celtic Park

‘I’m still speaking with the chairman (David Somers) and (consultant) Derek Llambias and my job is to keep winning games.

‘Those two gentlemen and myself know the importance of winning matches and getting out of the division. I still think in the grand scheme of things we have far more important league games.

‘I am not underselling the Celtic game at all or the transfer window, but I would rather strengthen to win the league than strengthen to beat Celtic.

‘Don’t think for a minute I am undermining the Celtic game, I am trying to totally focus on the most important thing which is trying to get out of the league.’

While Mike Ashley’s ambitions remain under wraps, one thing the Newcastle owner will not be doing is exercising the naming right he acquired to Ibrox.

Despite having bought them for £1m from Charles Green, Ashley this week confirmed he had torn up that deal – a move that’s undoubtedly popular with the vast majority of supporters.

McCoist fully understands the commercial pressures clubs are under and yet, as a lifelong Rangers fan, he was relieved to learn the name of Ibrox will remain unchanged.

‘I’m just glad we won’t get the opportunity to find that out,’ he said. Any good news is welcomed by the Rangers supporters and I think the majority see it that way.

Mike Ashley will not be renaming Ibrox, which will come as a relief to the majority of Rangers supporters

‘I can understand people trying to rename stadiums for financial purposes. But to the vast majority of supporters it will still remain Ibrox no matter what you put in front of it.’

With eight wins on the bounce and six clean sheets to boot, defender Darren McGregor believes a resounding win against Barry Smith’s men today will send out a message to Hearts – before they play Falkirk and ahead of next week’s showdown.

‘For me, this game is just as big as Hearts,’ he said. ‘We need to take three points and apply pressure.

‘Obviously with Hearts kicking off after us, it gives us a chance to do that. Of course it will put pressure on Hearts if we get it to within a point.

‘People will tell you they don’t look at papers or their closest contenders but the first thing you do after a game is look to see how your opposition have done. Hearts will be no different.

‘This will be the first time in the last couple of months where they might really feel the pressure. It’s a totally different ball game when the pressure is on. We’ll see how they deal with it.’
