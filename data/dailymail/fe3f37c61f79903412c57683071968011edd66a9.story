Baby drama: Mother Ceri Fiddes with partner Daniel Holley and new baby Jude at home in Somerset.
Dr Fiddes, a British maths expert, managed to keep a cool head under pressure after the shock of her car being rammed by burglars escaping her home

A top British maths expert who disturbed thievesÂ  as they attempted to break into her home gave birth after her car was repeatedly rammed by one of the burglars while he was trying to escape.

Dr Ceri Fiddes, 33, head of maths at the exclusive Millfield School had been sent back to her Somerset home from hospital in the early stages of labour when she had her traumatic encounter with the thieves.

The shock of the incident induced full labour and she gave birth to son Jude later the same evening.

The teacher, who is also a head of the British team in International Maths Olympiad competitions was with her groundworker partner Dan Holley when they pulled up at their home in the village of Stoney Stratton, near Shepton Mallett, to find a car on their drive.

First time mother Ceri had started having contractions on the evening of December 6 but nurses at Frome hospital told her to go home for a couple of hours because the baby wasn't imminent.

She said: 'When we got home it was about 10.30pm and there was a car on the drive with its lights switched off - it was very strange. Dan went out to investigate and there was someone in the driver's seat.

'He told Dan he was lost but when Dan asked him a few more questions he put the car in to reverse.I was still sat in our car which was parked across the driveway.

'When I saw the reversing lights go on I just didn't know what was happening because the car couldn't get past ours. Dan was trying to tell the driver his pregnant partner was in the car but he didn't listen.

'He started repeatedly ramming our car - it was horrendous.'

The burglar eventually sped off after Dan was able to move his car out of the way.

Ceri added: 'Dan rang the police and 
then went to check the house. He said he heard someone in the garden but
that they had run off.

'But they had broken in to our shed and taken some tools. Thankfully they didn't get in to the house though.

'By this time a police helicopter was flying overhead and the police had arrived with sniffer dogs at the house.

'They said they'd found the burglar's car abandoned not very far away and were hunting them down. They didn't find them though.

'Within five minutes of getting in the house my waters broke and Dan had to rush me back to hospital at Frome.

'I didn't think I was going to make it.

'The strange thing is my contractions had stopped when I was being rammed by the burglar.

'But when we got to hospital Jude was born within an hour. It was very quick.'

There and back again: Dr Fiddes was sent home from Frome Community Hospital in the early stages of labour but was rushed back after the encounter with the thieves

The drama didn't end there for Ceri 
unfortunately, the new mother had to be rushed back to Bath Hospital for
emergency surgery after she suffered complications with her placenta.

She and Jude are now doing well.

She said: 'It was just bad luck we came back at that time.

'I'm disgusted at the way some people can behave - ramming a car with a pregnant woman in it.

'I'm just thankful it ended well.'
