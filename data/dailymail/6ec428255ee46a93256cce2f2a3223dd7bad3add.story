Comedian Omid Djalili has issued a public apology after comparing England footballer Joleon Lescott to a 'Klingon' - a character from the sci-fi television series Star Trek.

The British-Iranian performer made the comment on Twitter about scars on Lescott's forehead.

He was apparently unaware the marks were caused when the footballer- who scored in England's 1-1 draw against France on Monday - was knocked down by a car and dragged along the road when he was aged just five.

Klingons are a fictional warrior race in the Star Trek universe with ridged foreheads.

After Lescott scored Djalili tweeted: 'I love u Lescott. Never said u were a deformity. Always rated him' and 'To be fair a lot of forehead to aim for #Lescott.'

But at the final whistle, he controversially added: 'Bravo England, even though u give 
me 3 kinds of bowel disease watching you. Love Lescott. 1st Klingon at 
Euros.'

Some of his followers took offence at his 'disrespectful' comments and Djalili quickly repented.

'Like to apologise to Joleon Lescott if any tweets made last night caused offence,' he tweeted.

'No idea he's been injured in a car accident aged 5. Shouldn't make 
remarks about people's appearance whether they've been injured or not. 
Come on England!'

He later added: 'I spend 15 per cent of my waking hours apologising.'

Lescott was left with scars on his forehead and hairline when he was struck outside his primary school in Birmingham.

He was dragged along the road by the car, while his distraught mother watched on from her own vehicle.

'I was lucky,' he said in 2006. 'A lot of people have come off a lot worse than I did.

'I saw another little boy in hospital who came in without a scratch, but had suffered brain damage after being hit by a wing mirror. I have a scar but I have nothing to worry about.'

The defender, now 29, added: 'I had a major operation straight away and several more over the next few months but I was young and didn't really know too much about what was going on.'

It's not the first time Omid Djalil's humour has landed him in hot water.

In 2009, BBC3 controller Danny Cohen, who is Jewish, said he was offended by a
joke 43-year-old Djalili had told about 'the Jewish secret service', 
which used the stereotype that Jews are obsessed with money.

Afterwards, Djalili apologised to Cohen and they spent a long time discussing the issue in private.

The clash happened at the BBC Comedy 
Forum, an event hosted by BBC director of vision Jana Bennett, who is 
responsible for all of the Corporation's television.
