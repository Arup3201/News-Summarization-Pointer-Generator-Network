A charismatic and inspirational moon bear who became a symbol of the animal welfare movement in China after surviving 30 years of captivity on a bile farm has died after beating overwhelming odds to live out the final years of his life in freedom.

Oliver the bear won a host of celebrity admirers including Born Free star Virginia McKenna and Downton Abbey actress Lesley Nicol after being rescued with a group of other bears from appallingly cramped cages in a bear farm in Shandong.

He confounded expectations when he survived emergency roadside surgery during his dramatic rescue in 2010 to live his remaining four years in a bear sanctuary in Chengdu, western China, run by the British charity Animals Asia.

Charming bruiser: Oliver beat the odds to survive his terrible ordeal and then enjoy his freedom at a sanctuary run by British charity Animals Asia

A charming bruiser who seemed to shrug off the shocking infirmities wrought by years of abuse, Oliver came to epitomise the growing animal rights movement in Asia and starred in a film called Cages of Shame that helped turn public opinion against bear bile farming.

Moon bears rarely live beyond 30, however, and Downton Abbey star Lesley Nicol was moved to tears by the sight of him shuffling around his enclosure when she visited the Animals Asia sanctuary in Chengdu in Chengdu sanctuary in June.

But on Wednesday, as his condition worsened, vets took the decision to euthanise him and a stream of employees who helped rescue him and then cared for him at the sanctuary in his peaceful last years held his paw to say a tearful final goodbye.

Animals Asia founder and CEO Jill Robinson MBE said she was heartbroken at Oliver's death but said he had won the most important battle of his life when he survived his rescue from the Shandong bear farm in 2010.

'Oliver was a broken bear when we found him,' she recalled. 'His body and legs were misshapen by years of being crushed in a cage and we feared he would not survive the 1,500 mile journey home.

'On that day, when Oliver's condition began to deteriorate – panting heavily and refusing to eat – our vets decided that only an emergency operation would save his life.

Fight for life: Oliver had to undergo four hours of surgery by the roadside when he was rescued. Oliver's diseased gall bladder was removed along with a painful metal coil that had been inserted into his abdomen

Suffering: More than 10,000 endangered Asiatic black bears – known as moon bears - are confined in tiny cages from birth in farms across China and southeast Asian countries. Oliver pictured above in his cage

Harvested: Catheters are jabbed into the bears' abdomens to extract bile from their gall bladders. Bear bile sells for around £10-a-millilitre and is used in traditional Chinese medicines to treat a range of illnesses

'He was an old bear who had suffered more than anyone can imagine but it just didn't seem right that he could be so close to freedom and not make it.'

With a local police escort, the trucks carrying Oliver and the other bears rescued from the farm went to a local hospital and borrowed a bottle of oxygen needed for anaesthetic.

After four hours of roadside surgery watched by a huge crowd of onlookers, Oliver's diseased gall bladder was removed along with a crude and painful metal coil that had been inserted into his abdomen to fasten the gall bladder to his abdominal wall.

Robinson said: 'Oliver brought so many people together that day – from Shandong to Chengdu and across the country – and he's continued to do so ever since. As an old bear who refused to give up, his fight inspired ours.

'His story has continued to be told across the world and has raised increasing awareness of the horrors of bear bile farming. Our broken bear turned teacher and his stoic, gentle nature will continue to inspire the rescue of so many more.'

More than 10,000 endangered Asiatic black bears – known as moon bears for the cream-coloured crescents on their chests – are confined in tiny cages from birth in farms across China and southeast Asian countries.

Crude catheters are jabbed into the bears' abdomens to extract bile from their gall bladders. Bear bile sells for around £10-a-millilitre and is used in traditional Chinese medicines to treat a range of illnesses from haemorrhoids and sore throats to hangovers.

Campaign: Animals Asia founder Jill Robinson MBE with Lesley during the visit. Other celebrity backers include Olivia Newton-John, Ricky Gervais and Dame Judi Dench

Many bears rescued from the farms are left blind or have had their teeth and claws hacked out by farmers. Many are psychologically scarred by their captivity.

In a campaign backed by celebrities including Olivia Newton-John, Ricky Gervais and Dame Judi Dench, Animals Asia is working with the Chinese government to phase out bear bile farming and persuade people to use herbal alternatives.

Animals Asia Vet Team Director Nic Field said: 'The entire team is devastated at Oliver's passing. Despite everything he went through, his forgiving and spirited nature touched everyone who met him.

'Oliver's story is so powerful and he has become a focal point of the growing support of our work in China. He represents the suffering of the thousands of bears still languishing on China's bear farms.

'More importantly he has been a symbol of hope. Every visitor to the sanctuary and every supporter around the world knows Oliver's story. His legacy will live on.'
