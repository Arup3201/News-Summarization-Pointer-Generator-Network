The tributes to Leonard Nimoy, who passed away Friday from complications due to lung disease, are pouring in, including from where man once had never gone before.

Colonel Terry Virts tweeted a photo of himself holding up the Vulcan salute over the window of the International Space Station on Saturday to mark Nimoy's passing. 

Posted without a caption, Virts makes a spread V with his hand, a gesture popularized by the character Spock on Star Trek, which was often accompanies by the phrase 'Live long and prosper.'

As a NASA astronaut, Virts has piloted the space shuttle Endeavor and currently serves as commander of Expedition 43 aboard the International Space Station.

Back on Earth, a small memorial to the actor, who became one of the most recognizable faces on the original Star Trek series, appeared at his star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame.

Trekkies left flowers, notes and even a photo of Nimoy with co-star William Shatner, who played Captain Kirk alongside Nimoy's Spock. 

Fellow cast members, including Shatner and Jonathan Frakes, who played Commander William T Riker on 'Star Trek: The Next Generation,' left online condolences.

'#LLAP RIP to the best First Officer,' Frakes tweeted on Friday, using the abbreviation for 'Live Long and Prosper,' a popular phrase associated with the show that started with Nimoy's character.

Actor Zachary Quinto, who played the half-human, half-Vulcan character on the Star Trek reboot, posted Nimoy's photo to his Instagram.

'my heart is broken. i love you profoundly my dear friend. and i will miss you everyday. may flights of angels sing thee to thy rest,' the caption read.
