Emma Watson has denied claims that she is secretly dating Prince Harry after a magazine reported the fourth-in-line to the throne was 'smitten'.

The Harry Potter star put an end to the rumours with a tweet saying: 'World. Remember that little talk we had about not believing everything written in the media?!'

Australian magazine Woman's Day sent the internet rumour mill into overdrive last week after claiming the royal sent Miss Watson an email to invite her out when she split from her boyfriend.

But the UN Women Goodwill Ambassador set the record straight and tweeted saying: 'Also..... marrying a Prince not a prerequisite for being a Princess.'

She also posted a link to Alfonso Cuarón's 1995 film A Little Princess which includes the  line: 'I am a princess. All girls are.'

Her tweets were instantly acknowledged by her legions of loyal fans with the first post attracting 29,762 retweets.

Katie Tray tweeted: 'Am I the only person who is relieved to know that @EmWatson is not dating Prince Harry? Tbh, she's too fierce for him. She can do way better.'

Sammy Ammons tweeted: 'Emma Watson, very true. however, to someone out there, you will be a Queen.'

The fourth in line to the throne, pictured arriving at a film premiere earlier this month, was said to have asked Miss Watson on a date

Miss Watson met Prince William last year during a dinner to celebrate the work of the Royal Marsden

Actor Zach Braff said: 'I am the one dating Prince Harry. Privacy please. Blessed and humble.' 

The Australian magazine claimed that the pair were having 'secret dates' with each other and were 'getting to know each other quite well'.

According to Woman's Day, Harry, 30, asked the Harry Potter star out after hearing she had broken up with previous boyfriend Matthew Janney in December last year.

Miss Watson was said to have met with the prince with a group of 12 friends and seen him in secret since. 

The 'insider' apparently told the magazine: 'Harry didn't want her to feel like she was put on the spot,' explains one insider. 'A party also shows he's fun and not stuffy.'

'He's smitten – and it's more than Emma's looks.'

Prince Harry's last girlfriend was Cressida Bonas, with the pair splitting up 'amicably' last April

Prince Harry's first serious relationship was with Chelsy Davy, who he dated on-off for about six years

The rumour was met with a predictable flood of Harry Potter jokes. 

One tweet said: 'Emma Watson is dating Prince Harry! Despite JK Rowling's best efforts, Hermione is finally hooking up with Harry!'

Another said: 'I hope Prince Harry and Emma Watson last because if they have a son, it will be the half-blood prince.' 

Prince Harry broke up with Cressida Bonas in April last year after a two-year on-off relationship ended amicably.

The Prince was introduced to her by Princess Eugenie in 2012, with the couple's last public outing together coming at an England rugby match a month before they split.

Before that, Harry dated Chelsy Davy, but the pair broke up in 2010 after a turbulent six-year relationship.

After suggestions that the pair were set to get back together emerged in 2011, Prince Harry said her was '100 per cent single'.

Despite this, Miss Davy was invited to the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in April that year. 

Miss Watson - who played Hermione in the Harry Potter series - broke up with Oxford University rugby player Matthew Janney in December.

The couple, who dated for a year, went their separate ways due to Emma's unrelenting work schedule but said they were determined to remain friends.

Miss Watson dated Will Adamowicz for two years and was pictured embracing him at Coachella Music festival in 2012

The Perks of Being a Wallflower star's relationship with Mr Janney came not long after her split from long-term boyfriend Will Adamowicz.

Miss Watson, who is now a UN Goodwill Ambassador, met Mr Adamowicz in his first year at Oxford, where she studied for a year as a visiting student.

While the couple did their best to stay out of the public eye, they were seen embracing at Coachella music festival in 2012 and he joined her at the 2013 MTV Movie Awards.

A Clarence House spokeswoman said: 'Prince Harry's private life is private. We would not confirm or deny that.'
