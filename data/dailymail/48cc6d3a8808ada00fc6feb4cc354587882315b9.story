Cadaver dogs are to search the former site of the sister campus of a notorious Florida boy's reform school where pupils were beaten, raped and killed.

University of South Florida researchers have found the remains of 51 people buried at Dozier School in Marianna and are now turning their attentions to the Okeechobee School for Boys, with the search to begin in April. 

When the notorious state-run reform school in Marianna became overcrowded, a second campus in Okeechobee was opened in the late 1950s.

Several of the same staff members accused of brutal beatings in Marianna were also transferred to the Okeechobee campus.

The Okeechobee County Sheriff's Office told WESH.com they plan to bring cadaver dogs to the campus in April in the wake of their findings in Marianna.

Some former students from the 1950s and 1960s have for at least a decade accused employees and guards at both schools of physical and sexual abuse.

Although records only showed 31 burials at the Marianna school between its opening in 1900 and its 2011 closure, USF researchers found the remains of 24 additional people during a dig in 2013. They are currently working to identify all the remains.

Like Marianna, boys were housed at Okeechobee for minor offenses such as petty theft, truancy or running away from home, but many former students claim they were subjected to bloody beatings.

Boy would be taken to a small office called the Adjustment Center where they would be forced to lie face down and be beaten repeatedly with a leather paddle.

Former students recall stories of boys being beaten to death and buried behind the school's dairy barn.

'Some of the boys they would just beat, beat, beat, beat until they passed out,' Joseph Johnson told WESH. 'It was known among us that they would kill you. They would literally beat you to death.'

He claims he saw a boy being carried out and driven in a station wagon to the back of the school where the next day there was a fresh grave. When he asked a staff member they told him they had buried a cow.

Another student, who was on the segregated black side of the school, recalls friends suddenly disappearing and staff members claiming that the boys had run away 

'If they ran away, why hasn't anyone heard from them again?' Marvin Mike told WESH. 'They didn't run away. They was carried away.'

He said his friend, Cherry Black, went missing only for his body to be found in a septic tank on campus two weeks later. 

Staff claimed the boy had tried to run away, hid in the tank, and accidentally drowned in sewage.

Mike never believed their story.

'They killed him and put him in there,' Mike said.
