If you're bored of trying to explain to your parents what job you do, or exactly how hard you work, why don't you show them?

LinkedIn, the social network for professionals, has designated 7 November as Bring In Your Parents Day, in which employees are encouraged to invite their mother, father or grandparents into the office.

The company hopes it will 'demystify the world of work' as research finds one in three parents don't understand what their children do for a living.

The Bring In Your Parents initiative, created by social network LinkedIn, is scheduled for 7 November. The company hopes that by inviting parents and grandparents into the office, it will 'demystify the world of work.' Research found one in three parents don't understand what their children do for a living

Deutsche Bank, Edelman, Logitech and Regus are among the companies that have already signed up, while Google already runs its own official 'parents-in-the-office day'.

A survey by the LinkedIn found that childrens' jobs are confusing for parents because the nature and tools of work have changed.

More than a third (35 per cent) of parents surveyed confessed they were not completely familiar with what their child does for a living.

Half said they could be of benefit to their offsrping if they had a better understanding of their career, while 59 per cent said they want to know more about their child's employment.

'The world of work is changing rapidly and many jobs of today didn’t exist even 10 years ago,' said LinkedIn's head of talent Pat Wadors.

'While our parents are proud of us no matter what we do, they would be even prouder if they better understood our careers.'

LinkedIn recently trialled the scheme in its Dublin office, where around 100 parents came in to learn 
more about the company, and to see what their children do.

'The results were overwhelmingly positive', continued Wadors, 'One mother 
remarked that she had no idea how valued her daughter was at work and it
 made her proud.'

Despite the changes in the workplace over the past decade, LinkedIn also believes parents 'can be a valuable part' of a professional network because they may have faced similar challenges and learned 
valuable lessons along the way.

'It’s bridging a gap that will make for better relationships,' continued Danielle Restivo, LinkedIn’s head of global corporate communications.
