Somebody has to win the NFC South. That's the message from Atlanta running back Steven Jackson as the 2-5 Falcons prepare for their clash with the Detroit Lions at Wembley on Sunday.

Atlanta are not the only team struggling in that division. The Carolina Panthers currently lead the way on 3-3-1 with the New Orleans Saints (2-4) in second, the Falcons third and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1-5) fourth.

'We are only seven weeks in,' Jackson told Sportsmail. 'If somebody goes on a winning streak and wins their next nine games, they have a winning record. It is all about the team who are going to rectify their wrongs and go and take the division. We feel in Atlanta, why not us because someone has to win the division.'

As if injury problems with their offensive line weren't enough to deal with, the Falcons will come up against the best defense in the league on Sunday against the Lions.

Detroit enter the game in a different place - 5-2 atop the NFC North having just pulled off a thrilling 24-23 win over the New Orleans Saints. 

Jackson said: 'Detroit have had a very good first half of the season. Their skill players are some of the best in the National Football League along with a very tenacious, nasty defense led by Ndumakong Suh.

'It is unfortunate that a lot of my team mates have been injured. The offensive line has been decimated by injuries. Typically your offensive line is the nucleus of the team. They are the backbone, the big, tough guys who protect everyone around them and allow the smaller, skilled athletes to do their job well. 

'When you have so many injuries and then change up with guys trying to get not only used to each other and build that chemistry together but a game plan as well, it can be really challenging in the middle of a season.'

The Falcons landed at Gatwick Airport on Monday morning and will begin their practice for the week at Arsenal's London Colney base on Wednesday.

The foreign country and different environment may have an effect on some of the younger players in the league, but Jackson is experienced enough to be able to deal with the demands of playing a regular-season game in London and the distractions that may bring to a business trip.

But, even as an experienced traveller, Jackson admitted it would be tough for players if the NFL moves a franchise to London.

He said: 'Personally I know the difference between taking care of business and doing my part as an individual and I know how to balance the two. It would be harder for the younger guys.

'Outside of Los Angeles, England is the only other place where I see that it really makes sense to introduce a new franchise.

'The NFL season is grueling on it's own so to have 10 or 12-hour flights would be really challenging on certain teams. The London based team may have to be away from home for two or three weeks at a time and it could be quite a disadvantage.

Ndamukong Suh, Steven Jackson and Joey Barton were at NikeTown London as part of the 'Suit up for Sunday' campaign and ahead of the second 2014 NFL International Series game. This Sunday the Atlanta Falcons will take on the Detroit Lions at Wembley Stadium.
