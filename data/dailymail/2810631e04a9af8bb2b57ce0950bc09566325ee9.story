If you've waited until the last minute to book a holiday over Easter weekend, eurozone sunspots are offering plenty of great getaway bargains this spring, a new study suggests.

Thanks to a strong pound, the Algarve in Portugal is the cheapest beach resort for a family break, according to a Post Office Travel Money report.

Those who aren't sold on Portugal can find similar bargains in the Spanish Costas, Tenerife and Cyprus.

The Algarve region in Portugal offers the best getaway bargain for the long Easter weekend, a study found

In the Algarve, the cost of meals, drinks and ice creams has dropped 20 per cent over the past year following the pound's rise against the euro.

A meal including drinks will cost a family of four just £29.87, which is almost £7 less than last year.

The story is similar in the other eurozone resorts, with prices in the Costas almost as cheap as the Algarve following a 15 per cent drop from 2014.

Although slightly more expensive, Tenerife and Cyprus also offer tourists exceptional bang for their buck, the study said.

Perhaps most important for holidaymakers, the Canary Islands and Cyprus offer more guaranteed spring sunshine than their bargain counterparts.

Towns like Albufeira, Portugal (pictured) offer savings of 20 per cent from last year, the study said

In the Spanish Costas, like Costa Blanca (pictured), prices are almost as low as Portugal's Algarve region

Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said in a statement: 'Although holidaymakers will get far more travel cash for their pounds in the eurozone, prices vary significantly between resorts, so the best advice is for canny travellers to cherry pick and book a resort where prices are cheapest.'

'It will be hard to beat Portugal and Spain but, as the weather warms up, Greece is shaping up to be great value too.

'Resorts in Italy and France are more expensive but the good news is that there are big savings for those who want to visit Sorrento or Nice.'

Cyprus, while more expensive than Portugal or Spain, does still offer substantial savings - and lots of sunshine

But Britons looking to save would be wise to stay away from the US, especially in light of a poor exchange rate.

For those truly eager to head across the pond, the best value can be found in the family-favourite destination of Orlando, Florida, but prices are still far cheaper on this side of the Atlantic.

In Orlando, prices for the six family items surveyed by the Post Office cost twice as much as the Algarve - £68.39 in the home of Walt Disney World compared with £34.31 in the Portuguese coastal region.
