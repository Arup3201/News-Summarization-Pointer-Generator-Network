A 13-year-old schoolboy was killed a train while walking home near the tracks with his earphones in.

She agreed at 3pm and then about 20 minutes later he had been killed. 

'He called me from school and asked if he could walk home. And I told him he could,' Jessica Bellinger said told ABC7Chicago.

'I started calling him and wasn't getting any answer.

'Then I heard there was an incident on the train tracks. Didn't know it was him at the time,' Bellinger said.

Police said Jeffrey was wearing earphones under his hoodie so he did not hear the approaching train and did not hear the driver's attempts to alert him with the whistle.

His death was ruled accidental.

His mother told the Chicago Tribune that she wished she had not given him permission to walk home.

She is now planning her only child's funeral. 

'I think I'm bringing this to put with him,' Bellinger told the newspaper pointing to a  ball cap signed by world champion martial arts expert and Tae Bo creator Billy Blanks - she said it was one of his favorites.
