An Ohio teacher has been suspended without pay for allegedly making racist remarks towards a student, and may be fired from the school.

The Fairfield Board of education suspended Gil Voigt on Monday for telling an African American student earlier this month on December 3, 'we don't need another black president' after the student expressed interest in becoming president one day.

Voigt has taught at Fairfield Freshman school for 13 years and this is not the first time he's gotten in trouble for racist remarks. Board president Dan Murray say the suspension is the first step in dismissing the teacher.

Cincinnati.com reported that Assistant Superintendent Roger Martin compiled a list of all of Voigt's offenses. In 2008, Voigt made an inappropriate racial comment. That same year he got in trouble for improper use of school technology.

In 2012, he received a verbal warning for calling a student 'stupid.'

'This is a rare occurrence. This is the first time I’ve faced it since being named assistant superintendent (in 2011),' Martin told Cincinnati.

The teen was taken out of Voigt's class after his parents complained. Four students interviewed by the school complied with the victim's story.

Voigt believes he was misquoted by the student who he said caused trouble in class.

'We intend to uphold board policies and to hold teachers accountable for the essential functions of the teacher job description,' Martin said.

'Obviously we’re very disheartened to have this situation with any of our staff members, Superintendent Paul Otten said.

'It’s not something we’re proud of, and it’s something we must not tolerate,' Martin told The Dayton Daily News.
