Gus Poyet has reassured Emanuele Giaccherini that he has a future at Sunderland after a nightmare two seasons at the Stadium of Light.

The 29-year-old has been ruled out until the summer after suffering a recurrence of the ankle injury which has limited the playmaker to just four starts this term.

Giaccherini also struggled to impact last season after his £6.5million arrival from Juventus.

Poyet, though, is refusing to write-off the 21-times-capped Italian. 'Last season was tough for him,' said the Uruguayan. 'Being so small, it took him time to adapt to English football and the system I played didn't really suit him.

'He then had a difficult summer after not making the World Cup squad but he didn't sulk. But when we returned before the season he was a different player - like a new signing - and we were looking to use him in different positions.

'So losing him is a big blow. You need to know him as a person, how nice he is and how determined he was to make an impact this season after what happened last year.'

And Poyet added: 'He can still make a big impact at this club when he's fit. If he comes back next season in the way he started this one, he is going to play regularly.

'I'm telling you he can be impressive and I'm not just saying that because he's out. He has moved to another level and has adapted. He is stronger, more clear-minded and we will see that when he is fit.'
