Note to all managers: if you’re top striker is misfiring, have a word with Tim Sherwood.

He obviously knows the secret of getting them back among the goals.

Sherwood, albeit for a short period of time, revived Emmanuel Adebayor’s flagging Tottenham career last season; now he’s replicating the achievement with Christian Benteke.

His success in rejuvenating Benteke, who has scored six goals in eight games, will be viewed as, perhaps, Sherwood’s most vital contribution if Aston Villa win their Premier League survival battle.

‘It’s about strikers applying themselves,’ said the Villa boss, fresh from his side’s victory over former club Tottenham.

‘Like Ade, when I gave Ade an opportunity to come back into the group at Spurs, he had to earn the right and he did that by the way he trained. Christian’s no different.

Stat: Since Sherwood took over at Villa striker Christan Benteke is the Premier League’s top goalscorer.

‘I think Christian was on the back of being dropped I think when arrived.

‘I’ve had chats with him, told him what I think of him and how everyone in Europe seemed to want him a year ago, and that doesn’t just vanish.

‘So let’s get him back firing, let’s get him back training properly, and scoring goals.’

Indeed, similar patterns are emerging from Sherwood’s spell as manager at White Hart Lane last season and his current job in the Midlands.

In addition to turning Adebayor and Benteke back into Premier League forces he’s brought his fearless approach to blooding youth players with him to Villa Park.

Where would the careers of Tottenham pair Harry Kane and Nabil Bentaleb be without Sherwood’s guidance last season?

And we saw further evidence of the manager’s youth-minded attitude as he handed Jack Grealish, 19, only his second Villa start at a White Hart Lane on Saturday.

Not only that but playing the teenager in the influential No 10 role.

Villa manager Sherwood was visibly ecstatic at recording the win and getting three points upon the final whistle

Sherwood said: ‘We’ve got good young players coming through at Villa. Jack Grealish has been given his senior debut and Rushian [Hepburn-Murphy], 16 years of age, is another.

‘Jack played in a position where you need maturity but I don’t think he’s fazed. I really mean that.

‘If I thought he was going to be a gamble I wouldn’t have done it, but Jack’s got real ability, you can see that.

‘He’s got a big future at this football club. He’s certainly at the right place.

‘So if you’re a young kid coming through, you’re not going anywhere else. You go to Tottenham or come to Villa. ‘They’re the two massive football clubs but you’ve got two managers who are going to give them an opportunity.’

Villa’s win virtually ended Spurs chances of qualifying for the Champions League.

And when asked whether he’d want another campaign of playing in the Europa League manager Mauricio Pochettino provided an uncommitted answer.

‘How would we deal with the Europa League again? It’s difficult. It has been a very long season. When you do a whole season playing Thursday-Sunday maybe you arrive at the end at very difficult level,’ said the Argentine.

‘It’s not easy playing in the Europa League. When you are a young squad and you make the biggest effort during the season maybe you arrive, not physically, but mentally in a very difficult moment at the end of the season.’
