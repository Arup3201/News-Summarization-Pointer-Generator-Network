Teacher: Darri Poucher has been jailed after grooming a 14-year-old schoolgirl. He met her at a nightclub where he bought her alcohol and slipped his hand under her top

A 31-year-old teacher has been jailed after grooming a 14-year-old schoolgirl.

Darri Poucher showered the girl with attention and met her at a nightclub where he bought her alcoholic drinks and slipped his hand under her top.

He became over-familiar with the pupil - calling her 'babes' in private Facebook messages - and groomed her for sexual purposes.

The supply teacher, of Deeping St Nicholas, near Spalding, Lincolnshire, denied the charges, but was jailed for one year at Grimsby Crown Court where the judge described him as 'manipulative” and 'deceitful'.

Judge David Tremberg said: 'You are a manipulative, deceitful, resourceful fraudster with an unsavoury eye for young girls.

'You are an unreconstructed sex offender and it’s necessary to protect the public from the risk of serious sexual harm from you.

'These offences were a serious breach of trust. It was committed over some time and there was a significant age difference between you.

'These offences are so serious that only an immediate custodial sentence is appropriate for them.'

Poucher had become a supply teacher at the school in Grimsby, which cannot be named for legal reasons, in 2009.

Michael Smith, prosecuting, said: 'She began to notice that she was different from the other girls in the class because he was making so much of her.

'It became clear to her that he appeared to take a particular interest in her. He was talking to her more often than he would the others. He would see her after school and chat with her.

'He was making her feel that she was a favoured pupil. He began messaging her on Facebook in a way that was wholly inappropriate for a teacher.'

The pair exchanged messages about the X Factor and music, in which Poucher called her 'babes' and she called him 'love'.

In another, she told him: 'Gosh, you are a geek.'

Mr Smith: 'She should not have been doing it but what was he doing allowing that sort of behaviour?

'He was prepared to approach this young lady, who was one of his pupils.'

The girl 
told Poucher she was going to a nightclub in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire 
and he deliberately went there to find her and speak to her.

He
 was friendly towards her, put his arm around her, bought her alcoholic 
drinks and allegedly put his hand under her top before stroking her 
back.

Mr Smith said: 'He intentionally met her in the Pier nightclub and he intended to do something which involved the commission of a sexual offence.

'He was being touchy-feely. He put his hand on her bottom. He was dancing very close up to her.

'He sexually assaulted her. The touching was sexual. He knew full well that she wasn’t 16 or over and the touching was sexual.'

The following Monday, Poucher spoke to the girl at school and said he was sorry if he had embarrassed her in the nightclub.

Poucher left the school but continued to send messages until April 2012.

The matters came to light when the teenager was discussing career options with another teacher.

The girl mentioned she had exchanged Facebook messages with Poucher and had met him in the Pier.

Despite admitting being friendly with the girl and meeting her in the club, he denied buying her alcoholic drinks or touching her in an inappropriate way.

He claimed he had reported the matters to other teachers at the school but they had no recollection whatsoever about this.

Poucher was given a 10-year sexual offences prevention order, restricting his future contact with girls under 16, and he must register as a sex offender for 10 years.

In separate cases, Poucher had already admitted two offences of fraud by claiming he was a qualified teacher, intending to make a financial gain, between May and July 2011 and between September and May 2012. 

He was jailed for two years for those offences, to run consecutively.
