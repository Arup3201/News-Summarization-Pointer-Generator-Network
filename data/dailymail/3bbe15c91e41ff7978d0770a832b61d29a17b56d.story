A horse sparked a seven-hour rescue operation after it fell down a 10ft hole and into an underground chamber where it was stuck for 24 hours.

The 14-year-old animal, called Sianey, was in its field in Linthwaite, West Yorkshire, when it trod on some loose boards covering the hole, and is thought to have toppled backwards into it.

She then spent the night underground after firefighters assessed her, returning the following day with specialist equipment to dig her out in a rescue mission lasting around seven-and-a-half hours.

Rescue mission: Sianey the horse sparked a seven-hour rescue mission after she fell through this hole in her field and into concrete chamber below

Excavation: Sianey spent the night underground after firefighters assessed her, returning the following day with specialist equipment to dig her out

The specialist fire crew from nearby Cleckheaton, assisted by another crew, drilled through the 2ft thick concrete walls of the chamber using circular saws and jackhammers, as a crowd gathered to watch the drama unfold.

Crews, who arrived at the scene at around 2.30pm yesterday, wanted to dig deep enough to enable the horse to walk free from the underground cave.

Wendy Dyson, her mother Barbara Pinder and daughter Amy own Sianey, and said they were amazed she was not seriously injured in the fall.

Trapped: Sianey was trapped inside this underground concrete bunker for 24 hours

Fears: Cleckheaton watch commander Colin Brown said the rescue mission was originally deemed to have been too dangerous, and that crews considered if it was more humane to put the animal to sleep

'I can't believe Sianey has only suffered superficial cuts and grazes,' said Ms Dyson.

'How she got down there I've no idea. The hole was covered up with flags and has just given way - we had no idea that was there.

'It looks like Sianey has gone down backwards and tried to scramble out with her front legs. The firefighters have been fantastic - they have been digging all afternoon.

'She could not have been dragged out without being anaesthetised which is why we need to dig her out.'

Cleckheaton watch commander Colin Brown said the rescue mission was originally deemed to have been too dangerous, and that crews considered if it was more humane to put the animal to sleep.

Free at last: Sianey is led out of her concrete prison and back into the fresh air

However, the field's owner then arrived just in time, and used a JCB to help dig a
 hole down the side of the chamber, removing around 80 tonnes of earth 
allowing the fire crews access.

'We
 had just started telling the horse owner the bad news and then one of 
the team came up with this idea and we went for it,' Mr Brown told local
 paper the Huddersfield Daily Examiner.

'The
 incident was reported to us at lunchtime and we had four large fire 
service technical rescue vehicles and 12 staff involved.

'After
 hours of hard work the horse finally came out at 9pm to rapturous 
applause from the 150-strong crowd who had gathered to watch. It had a 
slight limp on one of its back legs but was otherwise unharmed by its 
ordeal.'

Freedom: Sianey was eventually freed after the field's owner arrived and helped to dig 80 tonnes of earth away from the chamber, allowing fire crews access

Safe and sound: Sianey escaped her overnight ordeal with just a few cuts and bruises
