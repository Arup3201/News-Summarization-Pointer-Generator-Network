Emilie Livingston may have been launched into the limelight after marrying Jeff Goldblum earlier this month, but the newlywed is also famous in her own right.

The 31-year-old from Toronto has quite the impressive athletic past, from training with professional gymnasts in Russia as a child to qualifying for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, where she came in 17th in the all-around at the XXVII Olympiad.

In photos from her gymnastics competitions throughout the years, the brunette shows off her unbelievable flexibility, bending and contorting her body into seemingly impossible positions.

According to her Bloc Talent Agency bio, Emilie began dancing at the age of two, and at age six she started training in artistic gymnastics and ballet.

At just ten years old, she moved to Novogorsk, Russia, to train with renowned rhythmic gymnastics coaches Irina Viner and Lusi Dimitrova.

'I don't know how I survived it, but I am really glad I did. I think it made me a really strong and courageous person,' she told Neon Tommy in 2013.

'One thing about the Russians, they have no mercy. I wasn't around my family, there was no one there to coddle me but it helped bring my skill level up tremendously.'
