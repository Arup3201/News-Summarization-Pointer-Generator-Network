Anthony Watson's Bath coach and mentor rang England's rising star after the against-the-odds victory over Wales in Cardiff to congratulate him on a try-scoring display that captured the nation's attention.

Six years after having his breath taken away by the speed of the 14-year-old Watson's footwork, Neal Hatley was not surprised by his young charge's response.

'I phoned him after the game in Wales just to say, 'Well done on an unbelievable performance and your first try', and Ant replied, 'Yes, but I dropped one, didn't I?' He's always been like that, constantly striving for perfection.'

Watson's performance, on only his fifth England appearance, in front of 78,000 fans and more than eight million watching on TV, was so assured it was hard to believe that here was a young man who sat his A-levels only two years ago. 'I remember the first time I saw him he was about 14, a tall but real skinny kid,' said Hatley, who first coached Watson at London Irish's academy before convincing him to follow him down the M4 to Bath in his late teens.

'His older brother Marcus was down for an academy session and Ant came with him. We did some footwork drills with the top 17 and 18-year-olds in the group. Ant left everybody for dead. I'd never seen anything like it before at that age.

'We had him down the next week and it's gone from there. First impressions of him were of a young man with unbelievable footwork and unbelievable ability. Nothing's changed in that regard: Ant could step you in a phone box. He's a special talent.'

That footwork, allied to searing pace and a superb defensive work-rate, have seen Watson fast-tracked into Stuart Lancaster's squad after impressing all the way through England's age-group levels.

A hugely gifted young sportsman who had trials for Chelsea as a 13-year-old and also excelled at St George's Weybridge School in cricket and hockey, Watson — who also has three A-levels at grades A, B and C — was inspired as a youngster by England's 2003 World Cup-winning wing Jason Robinson.

'When I was playing at Under 9 or 10 level, I was watching Jason Robinson a lot and trying to emulate him,' he said. 'I just tried to be like him as a kid and I've followed it up from there.'

Being the middle brother of three, Anthony was driven by a fierce sibling rivalry which saw him constantly striving to better Marcus, now an England Sevens star, while his younger brother Callum, in his final year at St George's, tried to keep pace.

Watson showed world class finishing skills to gather Brown's chip to touch down against Wales 

'All the boys played rugby on a Saturday and football on a Sunday,' said his dad Duncan, himself a former Saracens flanker whose career was ended by a ruptured knee ligament.

'I think that's helped them tremendously with being able to kick a ball. They all made a decision to focus on rugby when they were 12 or 13.

'They'd run around in the garden all the time. Marcus would go out in the garden and kick a ball and Anthony would join them. Callum would be running around with his little feet trying to catch them but failing. Even from a very young age people would say Anthony could go all the way.'

Now 6ft 1in and weighing more than 15st, Watson has all the gifts to be a top-class international full back — where he normally plays for Bath — or wing.

A Daily Mail Vase finalist with St George's, his talent was evident from a young age. 'He always had beautiful footwork,' said James Reynolds, St George's head of sport. 'He wasn't the biggest at junior school but he was certainly part of a strong year. The Under 9s won the national title in 2003, the year England won the World Cup.

'He was very jinky and would dance his way up the field. His ability to beat players was outstanding. He would do stuff that was different and wouldn't conform to being the textbook rugby player. You didn't want to over- coach him or suppress that free spirit. His sidestep was lethal.'

Watson's lavish talents came to the attention of Lancaster when he broke into the England schools set-up when the now national coach was running the RFU academy programme.

'If you watch him in training, his ability to understand the defensive system and make good decisions, whether to come up and make the tackle or to back off when he's outnumbered, is very impressive,' Lancaster said. 'His aerial skills are exceptional. Two or three times at the weekend it was a 50-50 and he came up with the ball every time. He's big, tall, athletic and obviously we've not really put him in too much space in the games and that's his point of difference.

'I think he could be exceptional for us.'

In many ways Watson already has been exceptional. The way he scooped up Mike Brown's clever grubber kick down the right-hand touchline against Wales on Friday to kick-start England's revival bore the hallmarks of a world-class finisher.

This week Bath's head coach Mike Ford, who first saw Watson's enormous potential playing alongside his son — current England fly-half George — for England schools four years ago, highlighted the 20-year-old's much-improved temperament following his work with sports psychologist Don Macpherson.

'Anthony has learnt a lot from Don,' Ford said. 'Anthony's loving it. He said if he had played in this fixture last year he'd have been a nervous wreck, but on Friday he was full of confidence. He's got a great unpredictability about him, which is great to coach.'

Watson concurs. 'I can't exaggerate how beneficial that has been,' he said. 'I think a lot of people neglect the mental side of rugby but I think it's paramount in allowing us to go out on the pitch on the Saturday and allowing us to perform.

'A year ago I would have been massively nervous going to the Millennium Stadium in that hostile environment and having to play. This time I struck that perfect balance between being calm and excited.

'I was confident that I'd done all the work required and I was ready to perform. As a player, I don't want to stagnate. I always want to get better.'

On Saturday, at Twickenham, Watson will be striving for perfection again.
