One in ten Britons are now making money from a hobby, research shows.

Millions of people are turning their passion into part-time businesses, with the average hobby entrepreneur earning £1,815 a year from their venture.

These part-time businesses contribute £8billion a year to the UK economy, according to Visa Europe.

Sweet success: Imogen Hawthorne, 29, started her own cake-making business three years ago

In its report on the rise of ‘micro-entrepreneurship’, it found more than half of UK adults have a hobby or business idea they would like to turn into a money-making venture.

One in ten have already done so.

A quarter of this group said they has launched their own sideline because they liked being their own boss, while the same number also said it enabled them to do something they were passionate about.

The internet has boosted numbers, with many selling their products online and more than half advertising their goods on Twitter or Facebook, Visa said.

Hobby entrepreneurs working in design earned the most at £3,700 per year, while photographers were close behind earning £2,400.

Builders and decorators earned £2,300, but jewellery makers made just £300 – even less than bloggers at £400.

Optometrist Imogen Hawthorne, 29, started her own cake-making business three years ago.

Miss Hawthorne had always baked cakes for family and friends but began to make a profit from her hobby when she was asked to make 600 cupcakes for a large Asian wedding.

She said: ‘A friend asked me if I could make some cupcakes – 600 of them. I said ‘err, of course I can’, not really thinking.

‘It took me 12 hours to bake them, ice them and make individual icing butterflies for the top, but another four nights to put 600 favours boxes together for them to go in.’

She soon received more orders through word-of-mouth and started to sell her cakes at a local food market under the name Immy Paisley.

Her pudding-in-a-jar – including panna cotta and cheesecake – are particularly popular, she said.

Like many hobby entrepreneurs, she barely broke even in the first year as she invested in equipment, but now earns almost £2,000 a year. This is above the national average for part-time baking businesses at £1,600.

Miss Hawthorne, who works at Wolverhampton Eye Infirmary and lives with her comic book illustrator boyfriend Adam Bolton in Birmingham, said: ‘I think for a lot of people, part-time businesses are about scratching a creative itch.

‘I love my job as an optometrist but I wanted to do something creative with my spare time.

‘I bake in my evenings and weekends, although I try to give myself Sunday off when I can. Having my own business means it’s a hobby which pays for itself.’

Kevin Jenkins, of Visa UK & Ireland, which commissioned the survey of 2,000 UK adults, said: ‘Hobbies have always provided the first step to starting a micro-business.

‘Now, the breadth of opportunity is accelerating. Hobby entrepreneurs are no longer limited to their neighbourhood audience or word-of-mouth marketing.

‘Selling and marketing via the internet opens up the market to everyone.

‘It is a chance for anyone and everyone to be in business with an idea or craft they are passionate about.’
