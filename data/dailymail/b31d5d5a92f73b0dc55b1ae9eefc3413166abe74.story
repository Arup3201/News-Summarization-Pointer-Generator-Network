India head coach Duncan Fletcher’s continued bitterness over his England axing seven years ago and the acrimony between the two teams came to a head at a Lord’s function.

MCC put on their traditional drinks reception for the Test sides in the pavilion committee room last Friday night — but the Indians left before the England party had even arrived.

Fletcher, who can’t hide his huge dislike for the England cricket hierarchy since losing his job after a World Cup failure that followed the Ashes whitewash in 2006-07, made it clear his players would only be staying for a brief period.

Acrimonious: Duncan Fletcher (second left) with his India team is still unhappy about his England axing

As a result MCC president Mike Gatting brought forward his welcome address, after which Fletcher and Co quickly departed while the England dressing room were still celebrating Gary Ballance’s Test hundred. And when England did finally join the MCC party, Gatting had to make another speech.

Fletcher has also complained to the MCC about members in the pavilion walking behind the bowler’s arm when India have been batting. And ECB chiefs are understood to be blaming him for India being so resolute in their official ICC complaint about the Jimmy Anderson fracas at Trent Bridge with Ravindra Jadeja.

It is not just hoteliers in Rio that raise their prices for sports events. Closer to home, hotels around St Andrews in Scotland are already quoting £400 a night with a minimum week’s stay for the 2015 Open there confident of the demand from Japan and the USA.

Jaime Byrom, whose family business is at the centre of a World Cup ticket touting scandal, continues to plead the innocence of his British brother-in-law Ray Whelan.

Imprisoned: Ray Whelan is being held in a prison in Rio de Janeiro following a ticket touting scandal

He is still in custody in Rio’s notorious Bangu prison on suspicion of attempting to off-load £450,000 worth of hospitality packages to Algerian Lamine Fofana, whom it later transpired was a tout and on Byrom Group’s banned list.

Byrom said it was ‘tragic’ for Whelan to be held in prison when he had done nothing wrong. But the difficulty for Byrom’s Cheadle-based company is persuading Rio police that Whelan is the innocent party.

Shane Warne has done all he can to destabilise England captain Alastair Cook, yet MCC are so much in thrall to the Aussie irritant that they are even putting the plastercast from his broken hand in the Lord’s 200th anniversary match in the museum.

Meanwhile, it is understood Warne is still furious with his compatriot Brett Lee for causing the damage with a beamer.

Flower’s hanging on less than a year after last summer’s victorious Ashes defence, the England Cricket Board resembles a sinking ship.

On the way out with the England managing director, chief selector, chief executive and commercial director are now Goodwood-bound Mark Pearce, head of commercial, and Lesley Cook, HR director.

And the chances of either captain Alastair Cook or coach Peter Moores, a serial loser at international level, lasting the summer looks remote.

The clearout makes it all the more remarkable that former England team director Andy Flower remains on board, pulling the strings from behind the scenes at Loughborough as director of elite coaching.

Dry spell: England coach Peter Moores and captain Cook are overseeing a terrible period for England

Jackie Brock-Doyle, London 2012 director of communications, is a highly formidable late replacement to run the media operation at the Commonwealth Games following a serious family health issue for communications chief Gordon Arthur.

Brock-Doyle OBE was also rushed in for the 2002 Games in Manchester when it was felt the media chief was struggling, which is not the case this time.

Guy Kinnings, head of golf at IMG, is understood to be high on headhunters Spencer  Stuart’s wishlist to replace Peter Dawson when he retires as chief executive of the R & A after the 2015 Open.

Kinnings, who has also been linked with the European Tour top job, ticks all the boxes to be a leading golf administrator. But with the new American bosses of IMG focusing strongly on golf, Kinnings will need a lot of persuading to leave.
