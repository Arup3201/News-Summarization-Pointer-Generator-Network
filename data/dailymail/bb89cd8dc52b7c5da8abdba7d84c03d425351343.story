David Davis last night established himself at the head of a growing Tory rebellion over Syria.

The former shadow home secretary, who stood against David Cameron for the Tory leadership, said there were ‘huge risks’ in bombing Syria.

He added: ‘This will be interpreted around the Middle East in ways we can’t predict. I’m also not at all sure that it will improve the safety of British citizens.’

Mr Davis also warned he had yet to be convinced the lethal chemical attack was a ‘deliberate act of the Assad government’.

Fellow Tory Crispin Blunt, a former minister and soldier, said he would vote against the Syrian intervention tonight and in any potential second vote.

He said: ‘I haven’t seen any evidence that suggests whether or not the regime was responsible for this and identifying who in the regime (gave the order).

‘The UN weapons inspectors will establish that there was a chemical attack, they’re not going to be able to establish who carried it out.’

John Baron, who has helped organise a Tory rebellion that now numbers dozens, said: ‘I am starting from a position of voting against but let’s see what Cameron comes up.’

Former defence minister Gerald Howarth warned of the risk that the UK and allies ‘get our hand caught in the mangle’ by intervening in the civil war. ‘Where will this military intervention lead on?’ he said.

‘Will that be the end of the story or will there be calls for further action and are we then at risk of having our hand caught in the mangle?

‘I hope that when the Government says no decision has been made, that that is genuinely the case.’

Fellow Tory Sir Roger Gale said he remained to be convinced that ‘any intervention now will be other than too little, too late and ineffective’.

He said he was ‘gravely concerned’ about the implications of punitive action against the regime. ‘Any such response must be based first upon legality, must be proportionate and must be effective,’ he added.

Sir Roger said the experience of being persuaded to vote in favour of the Iraq war on false information ‘has left with me deep cynicism about the veracity of “military intelligence” that may or may not have been adjusted to suit a particular political purpose’.

Self-styled Tory leadership hopeful Adam Afriyie also came out against a military strike.

He said: ‘The British public have absolutely no appetite for being unnecessarily dragged into yet another Middle Eastern conflict.

‘They just don’t want us to get involved. I am with them.’

Former security minister Baroness Neville-Jones said the Government needed to be ‘cautious’ about the evidence it was considering, and publish legal advice on military intervention.

She said: ‘The public should be informed of the legal basis on which the Government is acting. Having a good evidence trail is going to be extremely important.’

Ukip leader Nigel Farage last night slammed the ‘rush for military action’.

He said: ‘Sending cruise missiles into Syria as a punishment for possibly using chemical weapons – how does that make anything better?’

Would bombing Syria be lawful?

Britain
 and the US insist it would be, but the truth is far from clear. It’s 
hard to see how Syria’s reported chemical attacks against its own 
citizens present a direct threat to either country.

What specific laws or UN conventions might be used as justification?

The
 UN Charter allows for military action on only two grounds – in 
self-defence, or if action is approved by the UN Security Council. 
Neither applies here. Russia has made clear its intention to veto any 
proposed Security Council resolution authorising action – as has China.

Can a military strike  be legal without a  UN resolution?

Unclear.
 In 1999, the Nato bombing campaign against Serbia was launched without 
one, with Tony Blair and President Clinton seeking to justify it on 
humanitarian grounds to protect Kosovan civilians. The intervention was 
widely welcomed, but its legality was questionable.

A similar 
humanitarian argument is being used to defend intervention in Syria. If 
President Assad is proved to have launched poison gas attacks on his own
 people, he will be in breach of the Geneva Gas Protocol, an 
international agreement dating back to 1925 – to which Syria is a 
signatory – banning the use of chemical weapons. But breaching the 
protocol doesn’t provide a clear justification for military action and 
it normally applies to international conflicts, rather than civil wars.

Does the UN have a ‘Responsibility to Protect’ the Syrians?

In
 2005, following the hideous atrocities committed in Rwanda and Bosnia 
in the 1990s, the UN brought forward an initiative called the 
‘Responsibility to Protect’.

It was designed to protect the innocent 
from genocide, war crimes and ethnic cleansing and places a duty on 
individual states to prevent such horrors within their borders, and an 
obligation to intervene if they see it elsewhere.

But former UN 
assistant Secretary-General, Francesc Vendrell, says the doctrine does 
not necessarily justify the use of force. All diplomatic efforts must 
have been tried first, and even then military intervention requires the 
backing of the Security Council – taking David Cameron and President 
Obama back to square one.

Does the PM need Parliamentary backing  for a bombing campaign?

Technically,
 no. He retains the power, under Royal Prerogative, to use military 
force without Parliamentary approval. However, all recent major military
 interventions – including the wars in Iraq and Libya  – have been 
preceded by a Commons vote. The Government has made clear it will 
‘respect the outcome’ of tonight’s.
