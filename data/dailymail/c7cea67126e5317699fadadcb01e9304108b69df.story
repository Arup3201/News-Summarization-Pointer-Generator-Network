A former Army Lance Corporal and his wife who pretended a freak bicycle accident had blinded their seven-year-old son to swindle £70,000 in insurance cash have been jailed.

Jeremy and Sally Anne Jones forged medical documents showing their son had suffered irreversible eye damage in the horror smash and used the money to buy a sports car.

They were both found guilt of one count of fraud by false representation and two counts of forgery and sentenced to a year in jail each.

The couple, both aged 38, were caught out by fraud investigators when they tried the same trick again - this time claiming that Mrs Jones had been partially deafened when their car backfired.

A judge at Salisbury Crown Court heard today how the couple dreamed up the scam after their son fell off his bike near the Army base where they lived and was rushed to hospital suffering from head injuries.

The court heard their vulnerable son - who suffers from Asperger Syndrome, autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - was probably not aware of the scam his parents were playing out.

They later submitted a claim to their insurer, AIG, saying the optical nerve in the youngster's left eye had been severed in the accident, leaving him permanently blinded.

The couple faked a letter from a real-life respected ophthalmologist, stating that their son's reported blindness was untreatable, which they faxed to AIG, the court heard.

The insurance company then paid out a lump sum of £70,000 into their bank accounts two month later.

Sadio Rizzo, prosecuting, said the document was a 'complete forgery in every way.'

Jones, from West Bromwich, stood stiffly in the dock with his hands behind his back.

His estranged wife, whose address was withheld by the court, did not acknowledge him as she entered the courtroom.

The court heard she was convicted in 1996 for falsely claiming £11,000 in benefits over a two year period between 1993 and 1995, Judge Keith Cutler, the Recorder of Winchester, heard.

The original accident took place in June 2010 outside the Bulford Camp army base, in Wiltshire, where Mr Jones was a serving officer and the couple lived at the time.

Their scam unravelled less than two years later after the couple tried the same scam again, alerting insurance investigators to a possible fraud.

This time they put in a £35,000 claim to AIG stating that their car had backfired in the garage, leaving Mrs Jones deaf in her right ear.

After officers began probing the fraud the former Lance Corporal applied for voluntary redundancy from the British Army, receiving a £42,107 payout. 

Police immediately seized the cash and will now return it to the defrauded insurers. 

Nicholas Cotter, defending Jones, said the former Lance Corporal was a man with 'difficulties.'

He told the court that the former soldier, who was recently working as a machinist, was 'frightened' of going to jail because he would not be able to care for his two children, step-children or gravely ill partner of nine months.

'When someone has their fingers caught in the till, they don't put them back in there again,' Mr Cotter said.

'He knows he is the author of his own misfortune, he has put himself in this position but those things do frighten him that the door will close shut.'

It also emerged Jones had previously been handed a caution for assaulting his wife in April last year.

The couple have two other children other than the son they involved in their deceit, a daughter and another son, aged four years.  

Defending Mrs Jones, Tom Wainwright said her husband had 'worn the trousers' in the relationship and that one of the forged letters to AIG had been sent from the guard room at the barracks where he was stationed.

He said Mrs Jones' personal problems were 'significant' and called on the court to take a 'merciful and lenient course' after she got a job as a carer, despite suffering from diabetes and angina.

Mr Wainwright appealed to the judge to consider the effect on the family's three children of jailing both parents, in particular on their eldest son.

'It has had a very serious effect on him,' he said. 'A young man with Asperger's can have great difficulty computing that and any change to his routine can have real psychological problems.

'This would not be just a change it would be a complete upheaval.

'She is trying to hold her family together as best as she can, but of course she has to be punished,' he acknowledged.

Mr Wainwright said the money had mostly been spent on paying off household bills and debts, saying: 'They were not flash cars or flash holidays or anything of that nature.'

However the couple's bank records showed that as well as paying off their debts, they had splashed their windfall on a Mitsubishi Lancer sports saloon.

Detectives brought in to probe the couple's actions discovered that following their son's accident they had forged medical letters, claiming to be from doctors at Salisbury District Hospital, to vastly exaggerate the extent of his injuries.

The court heard the crudely written letters were littered with factual inaccuracies and grammatical errors.

When detectives contacted the hospital, they were told that Mrs Jones had repeatedly failed to take her son to scheduled medical appointments and that, when she had, a specialist had confirmed that the boy was able to see in both eyes. 

Sentencing the pair, Mr Recorder Cutler said: 'To forge a letter such as that from a consultant in the National Health Service and making such claims is clearly an appalling act - not only just dishonest, certainly devious but many might think despicable.

'I am satisfied that that was a joint forgery, it is a joint document.

'I am sure that £70,000 to your family at that time made you all as a family, happier and you were able to buy a car and other things.

'It was not clear whether any money was put aside for [your son's] benefit, or for when he was older. [He] is not a part of this, he is someone whose unfortunate accident has led to this crime being committed.'

City of London Police Detective Inspector Oliver Little, Deputy Head of the Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department, said: 'Jeremy and Sally Jones shamelessly lied to their insurer about their young son's health to gain tens of thousands of pounds that they were not entitled to.

'Resolute on getting a payout they even forged medical documentation to support their spurious stories.

'Their downfall should serve as a lesson to anyone thinking of submitting bogus personal injury claims, off the back of actual or made up incidents, the Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department is working with industry to put you before the courts.'

David Halstead, Fraud Manager at AIG, added: 'Today's sentencing sends out the clear message that those committing fraud are increasingly likely to get caught, prosecuted and found guilty. 

'AIG will continue to take a tough stance on tackling insurance fraud. Customers should not have to pay the price for fraudsters through higher premiums.'
