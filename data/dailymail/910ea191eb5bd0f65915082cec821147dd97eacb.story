A three-year-old girl drowned in her family’s swimming pool after the teenage boy looking after her fell asleep on a lilo, an inquest heard today.

Marissa Cimmino had been left at home with the boy while her mother Evelyn went to run an errand, expecting her husband to return from a game of golf.

Mrs Cimmino forgot to tell husband Vincenzo that Marissa was at the house and he thought his wife had taken their daughter with her. When the confusion was discovered upon his return, he ran to the pool and pulled his lifeless daughter out of the water.

The inquest heard that Marissa knew she had to wear her lifejacket and be supervised while using the pool, but was discovered with no lifejacket on.

Lower Broadmoor Road in Crowthorne, Berkshire, where the girl lived with her family

The coroner heard that Mrs Cimmino left the family home in Lower Broadmoor Road, Crowthorne, Berkshire, just after 1pm on August 28 to make a short trip to Reading, thinking Mr Cimmino would return within an hour.

Marissa had been playing in the 18-foot long swimming pool that morning, supervised by a young teenage boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons.

'I didn’t want to upset Marissa by taking her away,' she said.

'I assumed my husband was on his way back due to the time. I assumed he would be no longer than 30 minutes.'

The inquest, in Windsor, Berkshire, heard that Mrs Cimmino sent a text message at 2.32pm asking her husband how long he would be and he said he had been delayed.

At 2.40pm he arrived home, as he received a second message. Neither message mentioned that his young daughter had been left playing in the pool.

'I assumed Marissa was with my wife, but it wasn’t discussed,' said Mr Cimmino in a statement.

Mrs Cimmino returned home 15 minutes after her husband.

'The first thing she said was "where’s Marissa?", I said "I thought she was with you",' he said.

'It was just a feeling I had, I went straight out towards the garden. I ran to the pool, saw Marissa floating face down and scooped her out and laid her down, starting CPR.'

The teenager, who had been asleep on a lilo in the pool, then woke up and Mrs Cimmino said she screamed at him and told him to call an ambulance.

Unable to find a phone, the boy ran to neighbour Virginia Bowyer, who had first aid training, and she ran to Marissa’s aid.

Mr Bedfod said transcripts of a 999 call made by Mrs Cimmino revealed that she could be heard shouting: 'I can’t believe you fell asleep and left her in the pool' as well as questioning why Marissa had no lifejacket on.

Mrs Bowyer was joined by another neighbour, Suzan Laverick, a retired nurse, and the pair took over CPR on Marissa until a paramedic, doctor and then an air ambulance arrived.

Mr Cimmino told Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford: 'I was so angry I went into the kitchen drawer, got a knife and stabbed the side of the swimming pool.'

Marissa was flown to Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey but, despite more than an hour of resuscitation attempts, she was pronounced dead at just before 5pm.

Mr Bedford explained that, while Marissa had been left with her lifejacket on, she was not wearing it when she was found.

He asked: 'Could she take it off on her own?'

Mrs Cimmino replied: 'I think they had got out of the pool, had lunch and watched TV and then he (the boy) had got back in.

'I really thought Marissa would be fine for the short time until my husband came back.'

A post-mortem examination recorded the cause of death as drowning.

Detective Inspector Andy Howard, of Thames Valley Police, said he spoke to the boy and described him as a 'very mature and sensible boy' who was very capable of looking after Marissa for the time in question.

'Tragically that time period was longer than anybody expected,' said Mr Bedford, who praised the courage of Mr and Mrs Cimmino, who work as an electrical engineer and hairdresser respectively, in providing statements.

'What you have experienced is every parent’s nightmare,' he said, adding that he agreed with the explanation that Marissa and the boy had left the pool, removing their jackets, before he returned and she climbed in without him knowing as he was asleep.

'Marissa’s parents would not be human if they did not blame themselves - Mr Cimmino, if he had got home earlier from golf and Mrs Cimmino if she had taken Marissa with her.

'This was a series of events that nobody could have foreseen and certainly nobody would have wished to have occurred.'

He recorded a verdict of accidental death. Mr and Mrs Cimmino declined to comment after the hearing.
