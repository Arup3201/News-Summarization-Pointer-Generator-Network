Intrusive: Judge Anthony Thornton condemned Haringey council for its heavy-handed approach to the abuse case

A mother told of her nightmare yesterday after being secretly 
investigated for child abuse by social workers who received a  single, 
anonymous letter.

The woman was left ‘terrified’ that her six-year-old daughter would be 
removed in the probe by Haringey Council – the authority at the centre 
of the Baby P scandal.

After winning a ‘landmark’ case yesterday, she also spoke of her anger 
that the local authority had sought to avoid being named in the affair 
to prevent further public embarrassment.

Officials had obtained three 
mobile numbers and a landline phone number for the family after 
contacting the girl’s school without her parents’ knowledge.

The mother – who works as a social 
worker – said she was ‘horrified’ when a student social worker later 
contacted the couple to belatedly reveal they were investigating 
allegations of mistreatment.

Yesterday a High Court judge condemned
Haringey for its ‘knee-jerk reaction’ to the unsigned letter, which was
riddled with spelling mistakes and grammatical errors.

This included approaching the child’s GP 
and her school to ask for any signs of ‘emotional and physical abuse’ of
the child before they had spoken to her parents.

Judge Anthony Thornton said the child was never at risk of harm from her middle class parents, who had never been in trouble with police or had previous contact with social services.

He quashed the ‘unlawful’ decision to start the investigation and ordered the council to pay £2,000 compensation to the couple and legal costs expected to run to tens of thousands of pounds.

After the hearing, the girl’s mother urged the Government to step in to 
sort out Haringey’s beleaguered child protection department.

She 
expressed fears that while the council squandered taxpayers’ cash 
investigating spurious complaints it risked overlooking genuine cases.

She said: ‘This has been a dreadful ordeal that has taken a huge 
emotional and financial strain on my family. Although I knew it was 
groundless, I was terrified they would take my child away.

‘We were accused of smacking our child. As it happens, we don’t smack, 
but if the council starts investigating all parents who occasionally 
smack their child to discipline them, they would end up looking at 90 
per cent of families in the borough.’

The woman and her partner are both experienced social workers and so knew the council’s reaction was excessive.

Decision: A judge ruled there was no basis on which the London Borough of Haringey's social workers should have started the inquiry. Haringey council building is pictured

They brought a legal challenge to the council’s decision to investigate them under Section 47 of the 1989 Children Act, which the judge described as an ‘intrusive’ assessment of a child and her parents to determine if she was being harmed.

The mother said: ‘Because we know the system we had the courage to stand up to the council and take it this far, but I pity the many other parents who aren’t able to do this and have to suffer in silence.

This is the first time that a section 47 investigation has been successfully challenged and overturned.’

The council launched the investigation after its ‘social services child abuse department’ received the unsigned letter dated March 2011 from someone claiming to be a neighbour of the family saying he was worried about the child.

The judge ruled that approaching the GP and school without seeking the parent’s permission was ‘erroneous’.

He said: ‘These were serious departures from permissible practice and these actions were unlawful.’ The child was not at risk of significant harm and it... was highly likely the anonymous referral was malicious.’

A Haringey Council spokesman said: ‘Our handling of this case fell below the standards that we would expect, and we apologise to the family concerned.’
