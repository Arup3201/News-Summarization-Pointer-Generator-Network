Prince Harry’s ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy drove him ‘nuts’ with a barrage of calls and texts while he was at Sandhurst, the phone hacking trial heard yesterday.

The jury at the Old Bailey was told that the Royal Family liked the Zimbabwe-born socialite but feared privately she was ‘needy’ and would distract Harry during his army officer training in August 2005.

The claims were made in an email from Clive Goodman, the News of the World’s royal editor, to Andy Coulson, the newspaper’s editor, which was shown to the jury yesterday. Goodman sent the email in 2005, when the couple had been together for about a year.

Claims: Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson (right, pictured today outside court) allegedly received an email in 2005 saying Chelsy Davy was blitzing her boyfriend Prince Harry (both left, in 2010) with calls

Message: The royal editor of the now-defunct tabloid, Clive Goodman (pictured), said Harry could only field the calls when he had finished his training duties at 10pm

He
wrote: ‘Chelsy is driving Harry nuts, she won’t leave him alone. 

'He’s 
not allowed to use his mobile at Sandhurst until he’s off duty. But 
she’s blitzing him with dozens of calls and texts when he should be 
concentrating on training.

‘Family
likes her well enough but they’re worried she’s incredibly needy just 
at the time when Harry needs to be concentrating on himself.

‘We’ve
been having a very quiet look at this independently and it works.

'She’s blitzing him with dozens of calls and texts when he should be concentrating on his training'

Clive Goodman, former News of the World royal editor

'In 
just over one month, she has put in nearly 60 calls to his mobile. 
That’s on top of texts.

‘Harry
can only field these after he’s finished his training duties, sometime 
after 10pm. He keeps the phone on, but on silent. It buzzes and vibrates
also frequently with new m [the message cuts off].’

The
couple remained together until 2010 when Miss Davy ended the 
relationship, reportedly because she did not want a royal life.

Goodman,
who was convicted of phone hacking in 2007, is said to have told his 
boss he was having  an ‘independent look’ at Miss Davy’s phone activity.

Goodman
is on trial in relation to alleged corrupt payments to public officials
while he was working for the now defunct News of the World.

Dinner party: Tabloid editors Rebekah Brooks (left, pictured yesterday) and Piers Morgan (right) exchanged banter at a dinner party about phone hacking, a media lawyer told the trial

Allegation: The court has heard claims that the newspaper used phone hacking to get stories on the royals, including a claim that Harry broke rules at Sandhurst by asking an aide for help with an essay

Piers Morgan bragged to Rebekah Brooks that he knew what her front page would be because he had been ‘listening to her messages’,  the Old Bailey heard yesterday.

Brooks, who was then the editor of the Sun, is alleged to have challenged her rival, then editor of the Daily Mirror, asking him: ‘Been hacking into my phone again have you Piers?’

Media lawyer Ambi Sitham described the exchange,  which allegedly took place at Andy Coulson’s birthday dinner in January 2003. Miss Sitham, who was sitting next to Brooks at the event, described it as an ‘odd conversation’.

She added: ‘There was a pointedness to it… it was entirely serious. I remember being uncomfortable.’

Coulson, 45, and Brooks,  45, deny conspiring with others to hack phones.

Brooks also denies conspiring with others to commit misconduct in public office and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

The
jury heard that, in a separate email, he asked Coulson for permission 
to pay a royal policeman £1,000 for a phone book with a direct line to 
the Queen.

Goodman warned 
him: ‘These people will not be paid in anything other than cash because 
if they’re discovered selling stuff to us they end up on criminal 
charges, as could we.

‘One 
of royal policemen (St James’s Palace) has obtained the brand new Green 
Book, the telephone directory with all the home numbers of the royal 
family and their household staff. The standard price is £1,000.’

The email went on: ‘Incredibly useful and he’ll be extremely handy in the Peat affair tale.’

The
‘tale’ was said to concern a false allegation that a former aide to the
Prince of Wales, Sir Michael Peat, was having an affair.

Coulson and 
Goodman are accused of corruptly paying a royal policeman for three 
internal royal phone directories.

The
jury heard Goodman was paying Glenn Mulcaire, who led phone hacking at 
the paper, an extra retainer to work on royal stories.

Coulson
and Goodman deny two counts of misconduct in a public office.

Coulson 
also denies conspiring to hack phones between  October 3, 2000 and 
August 9, 2006. The trial continues.
