A third student at Torrington High School has been charged with sexually assaulting at least one 13-year-old girl, as police warned the disturbed Connecticut community to brace for more arrests.

Mirroring the Steubenville, Ohio, rape case, which wrapped up this week, two hot-shot football players, Edgar Gonzalez and Joan Toribio, are facing charges of sexual assault and risk of injury to a minor after each allegedly had sex with a separate 13-year-old girl on February 10.

The pair were arrested late last month, but detectives revealed yesterday that another boy, a 17-year-old, was arrested on March 4, in connection with an incident last fall that involved the same underage girls.

All three boys have been suspended from school, pending expulsion.

The alleged victims, however, 
continue to attend classes while being the subject of horrific social 
media slurs from fellow students since the allegations against the 
footballers were made public.

The girls have been labeled 'whores,'
 'hoes,' and 'snitches' in tweets, that have been reposted by scores of 
teenagers. One Twitter user excused the shocking alleged rape as 
boys 'acting like boys' and said he'd tweet the 'exact same thing about 
what happened in Ohio.'

Torrington police revealed yesterday 
at a press conference that family members reported the 
alleged abuse the day after it is believed to have taken place.

The 17-year-old suspect is considered
 a minor and his case was referred to juvenile court. No details of the allegations have been released.

Lt. Michael Emanuel said there were 'possibly' more arrests coming.

'It's very complex, but (the case is)
 under control,' Emanuel said.

Insisting that he was 'not minimizing this,' he stressed that the 13-year-olds knew the accused. He said the incidents are being investigated as sexual assaults because of the significant age gap between the alleged victims and the older boys.

'It was consensual in the sense that it was not an attack but not consensual in the eyes of the law,' Emanuel said at the news conference.

Toribio was initially charged last month with three felonies including 
second-degree sexual assault, risk of injury to a child, and risk of 
injury to a minor (sexual contact).

But on March 4 he was charged again 
with second-degree sexual assault and risk of injury to a child in 
connection with an incident that took place earlier that same day.

He has pleaded not guilty and has posted $100,000 bail.

His friend, Gonzalez, who was named 
Most Valuable Player, was charged with second-degree sexual assault, 
risk of injury to a child, and risk of injury to a child (sexual 
contact) in the February 10 incidents. He has also pleaded not guilty 
and remains on $65,000 bail at the New Haven Correctional Center.

Torrington High School athletics 
director Mike McKenna has been criticized for minimizing the alleged 
assaults, suggesting they are the type of thing that happen 'anywhere.'

'Much like anywhere, there are kids 
that get in trouble, kids that do dumb things and get in trouble, 
sometimes bad trouble,' he said yesterday, according to the Hartford 
Courant.

The Register Citizen,
 which broke the story, named and shamed the classmates who bullied the 
alleged victims on social media.

Today the newspaper defended this decision, 
claiming that publishing their identities gave the country a taste of how 
'horrifying and uncomfortable' the past few weeks have been for the 
13-year-old girls.

'Vaguely summarizing this kind of 
bullying, identities protected, would have allowed the school district 
to continue to ignore the problem and the community to assume that it 
was 'someone else's kid,' group editor Matt DeRienzo said in an editorial.

'But the fact is that "good kids," 
from "good homes," honor roll students, athletes, male, female, 
participated in this stuff, and showed a fundamental and staggeringly 
dangerous misunderstanding about rape, consent and how to treat other 
people.'

Many of the bullies had made their Twitter accounts private or deleted them by mid morning.

Police said at the conference that they weren't aware of the nasty tweets until detectives read them in the Citizen on Wednesday but would investigate them.

'We don't have any information on that (bullying),' Emanuel said. 'Of course if there is any information we'd like to bring it forward and our detectives would like to take a look at that.'

The news of the alleged sexual 
assault yesterday came just days after two star football players in 
Steubenville were convicted of rape in a case that shook the nation.

As well as being called a 'whore' and criticized for 'snitching'  the 13-year-olds have been blamed for 'ruining' the lives of the popular players.

Ohio: The case mirrors one in Steubenville, where two football players were convicted this week of raping a girl who was later threatened online

One Twitter user wrote: 'Young girls 
acting like whores there's no punishment for that young boys acting like
 boys is a sentence.'

After The Citizen
 published his tweet, the same user wrote multiple tweets blaming the 
girls for getting themselves in that situation before insisting that he 
'would tweet the same exact thing about what happened in Ohio.'

Another
 bully tweeted: 'Even if it was all his fault, what was a 13-year-old 
girl doing hanging around 18 year old guys..' The tweet was reposted 11 
times and received six favorites.

A
 judge has ordered details of the Connecticut allegations to be sealed 
from public view. This tends to happen in the state when a case is still
 under investigation, and when a young victim is involved.

The
 warrants will remain sealed for 15 days at which point a hearing will 
be held to decide whether the details will be made public, according to 
the Citizen.

The truly disturbing case echoes the 
one in Steubenville, where two football players were convicted this week
 of raping a girl who was later threatened online.

Gonzalez
 and three other Torrington football players were also embroiled in a 
hazing scandal last year but police now say the investigation is closed.

Coach: Athletic Director Mike McKenna said the incidents were not reflective of the culture of the football team

Culture: Both this and the Ohio rape case have raised questions about the football culture in local high schools

Gonzalez
 was charged in a March 2012 alleged felony robbery after he and three 
others allegedly jumped three 14-year-olds in search of money.

Jeffrey
 Holder, 19, a former Torrington High School football player, was also 
charged but the other two co-conspirators were not identified because of
 their age. Gonzalez pleaded not guilty in that case.

Former Head Coach Dan Dunaj, who resigned in December, allowed Gonzalez to play in 2012, despite the charges.

He
 told the Citizen yesterday that he 'reeled the kid in' when he became 
aware of the pending robbery charges against Gonzalez 'and he walked the
 line. As a coach I was doing something right.'

Dunaj said, however, that sexual 
assault charges are a different matter, insisting he would kick the 
18-year-old off the team if he were still in the role and Gonzalez had 
another season ahead of him.

'My
 process has always been like this, and I learned this from my high 
school coach, and I never got into any big trouble, thank God, but if 
you didn't give the kid a chance then who's going to,' Dunaj told the 
newspaper.

McKenna insisted the incidents are isolated and not indicative of a sordid 
culture within the football team.

Sealed: Details of the allegations against the two friends have been sealed from public view

'If you think there's some wild
 band of athletes that are wandering around then I think you're 
mistaken,' he told the Citizen.

According to McKenna, a student 
athlete would be suspended from play for a 'serious infraction.' 
However, he couldn't say whether a felony or a misdemeanor would be 
enough.

He told the newspaper that he personally considered a violent felony worthy of a suspension.

In Steubenville, head coach Reno Saccoccia may face charges for his failure to report the shocking rape by quarterback Trent Mays, 17, and wide receiver Ma'lik Richmond, 16.

He allegedly told the two star players that he'd 'make it go away,' referring to the allegations, rather than telling police.

Both cases have raised questions about the football culture in local high schools.

A comment on the Citizen's story reads: 'The power of the football team. Be a good athlete and you can do no wrong.'

Scores of MailOnline readers voiced similar opinions after our original story was published yesterday.

The victim in the Ohio case has been viciously tormented on social media by other teens.

Yesterday it emerged that two girls, aged 15 and 16, who are facing charges for allegedly issuing death threats to the girl will stay in custody pending trial to protect the victim.

Toribio is scheduled to be in court April 23. Gonzalez is scheduled to be back in court on April 2.
