Parts of Britain are today basking in sunshine with temperatures set to hit 21C and people flocking outdoors for a Bank Holiday barbecue.

The best sunshine is in the East from London up to Lincoln, although outbreaks of rain are expected to arrive from the West this evening.

The high temperatures compare with 18 or 19C in some of the northern and coastal areas of Greece.

But the rest of the UK is cooler and unsettled in some areas with Northern Ireland failing to 
reach double figures and outbreaks of rain in Scotland.

Figures from Asda and Waitrose suggest the sunshine has inspired a wave of impromptu barbecues, with both reporting spikes in sales.

But be warned if you're heading for the woods, because zoologists say the mild and damp conditions have provided the perfect breeding ground for ticks.

Bristol University zoology professor Richard Wall found up to 300 of the blood-sucking parasites living in 10 sq ft of urban park land in the city.

Meanwhile, supermarkets are reporting increases in sales of barbecue meats and picnic food such as cocktail sausages, pork pies and scotch eggs.

Steve Peppiatt, branch manager at the Waitrose store in Twyford, Berkshire, said: 'May Bank Holidays often give Brits a first flavour of summer.

‘And this weekend has not disappointed. Al fresco dining has clearly been top of the agenda.

'Sales of barbecue meats sizzling and 
pre-prepared salads [have been] soaring alongside seasonal favourites 
including Jersey Royals and British asparagus - which is up 28 per cent 
year on year.

‘Customers 
have also been dusting off their picnic blankets and stocking up on 
picnic must-haves including cocktail sausages, pork pies and scotch 
eggs.'

Ticks
 should be removed from the skin as soon as possible using fine-tipped 
tweezers. Health officials also advise regularly checking your body - 
especially skin folds - for the parasites.

To
 avoid bites, use a repellent on skin, avoid contact with tall 
vegetation, walk on paths or tracks rather than in long grass, wear 
light coloured clothing and tuck trousers into socks.

Pet owners have also been urged to check their cats and dogs for fleas and ticks to ensure their animals are free of them.

Ticks
 can spread a terrifying array of diseases, including the bacterial 
infection Lyme Disease which can be fatal to both humans and dogs.

Some of the rarer illnesses passed on by the insects include Q fever, Colorado tick fever and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

Late spring, early summer and autumn are peak times for tick bites, with the parasites often found when it is warm and damp.

A Lidl spokesman said: ‘We’ve seen an increase of over
one third in sales of our BBQ items this early May Bank Holiday compared to
last year.’

And an Asda spokesman said sales of sausages and barbecue equipment were expected to triple those of April.

Professor
 Wall's ticks test was carried out at Ashton Park Estate in Bristol, a 
popular site for dog walkers and hikers that overlooks the city centre.

It
 is thought that ferocious winter floods could be responsible for the 
increased number of the disease-carrying creatures around the country.

Experts say the mild, damp conditions have provided the perfect breeding ground for the blood-sucking parasites.

Now
 the weather has started to warm up the UK could become overwhelmed by 
the tiny creatures, putting pets at risk and spreading deadly bugs like 
Lyme Disease.

Professor Wall
 said: ‘It is important that people check regularly for ticks if they 
visit tick infested areas and, if bitten, remove any tick rapidly.

‘The
 high number of ticks doesn't make it unsafe to carry on visiting these 
areas though - and it is important that is remembered.’

He added: ‘It's important people check both their dog and themselves after a walk.

‘Ticks are often found tucked up in creases of the body, so the arm pits or behind the ears.

‘The best way to remove them is to use tweezers and put them close to the skin and press and twist them out.’

Tonight will see outbreaks of rain pushing eastwards over many parts of the UK, giving a few heavy bursts in places.

Early
 rain will largely clear tomorrow morning from the East to leave sunny 
periods and scattered showers, mainly affecting western parts.

Another
 rather showery day is expected on Wednesday, with the showers perhaps 
merging into longer spells of rain for a time across the South.It will be unsettled for a time on Thursday with showery outbreaks of rain, although it should become drier from the South-West.

Nick
 Prebble, meteorologist at MeteoGroup, warned today it could be the last
 chance to have a barbecue for the next few days as the weather begins 
to deteriorate. The Bank Holiday was probably going to prove the warmest day of the week for many, he said.

‘There is fairly patchy rain, with some heavier bursts moving into western Scotland at the moment. I think today will be the last of the completely dry weather so far in some areas.

‘It is going to be unsettled with showers and longer bursts of rain. It is going to be quite changeable. You might see sunshine one minute and then showers the next.

‘Tonight, rain already in western parts will spread eastwards. Showers or rain will move eastwards across the UK.’

A Met Office spokesman said rain overnight would be followed by a fine day with many areas enjoying bright and fairly sunny conditions.

‘We have got showery outbreaks and rain across many western fringes now, it will be going into Wales, the north west of England in the next few hours and western Scotland and that will gradually work its way eastwards.’

The odds on a Thames Water hosepipe ban being enforced this year have been slashed to 6/1 following the Bank Holiday weekend.

Bookmakers William Hill said that it is also 8/1 from 10/1 that a temperature of 100F (38C) is recorded in the UK this summer.
