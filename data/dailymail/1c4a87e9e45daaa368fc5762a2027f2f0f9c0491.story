It's only been a few weeks since she split from her toyboy pilot lover but Carol Vorderman was all smiles as she became the first woman to be named an honorary ambassador for the Air Cadets.

The former Countdown presenter, 53, was welcomed to RAF Syerston near Newark in Nottingham by Air Chief Marshal Sir Andrew Pulford.

Ms Vorderman - herself a qualified private pilot - was later unveiled as the only female Group Captain Ambassador in the flying organisation’s 76- year history.

New appointment: Carol Vorderman has been announced as the new Ambassador for the RAF Air Cadets, RAF Syerston, Nottighamshire

Looking glamorous in her RAF uniform, she laughed and joked as she spoke to several young cadets throughout the morning.

Ms Vorderman, who has an MBE for her services to broadcasting, said: 'I am truly honoured to be appointed as an ambassador for the RAF Air Cadets.

'I can’t wait to meet the cadets, and the adult volunteer staff who give so much of their time to support them,' she said.

'The cadets themselves are a shining example of the best of British youngsters, standing with them on a parade square will be a great privilege.

'The Air Cadets is open to all and has squadrons all over the UK. Many are taught to fly gliders even before they get their driving licence. 

Putting on a brave face: It's only been a few weeks since she split from her toyboy pilot lover but Carol Vorderman was all smiles today as she was honoured

'They have great fun with many taking part in adventure training, all kinds of sport and the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme. Lots of good engineering and technology practice even allows cadets to learn and achieve BTECs.'

She also spoke of her own two children - both of whom are also keen fliers and have been part of the Air Cadets. 

'I am the mother of two children who have been either part of Air Cadets or University Air Squadron and they both loved it,' she said.

'This is like coming home. I was studying for an engineering degree at Cambridge in 1978 and desperately wanted to join the RAF as a pilot, but sadly back then they wouldn’t accept women in that position, so after I graduated I went off into another life.

'I finally got my Private Pilot’s Licence last December. Things are very different now and I know a number of incredible female RAF pilots.

'The Air Cadets is an inspiring organisation for young people to join and the RAF is a unique family to be a part of. There will now be two of us at home who are part of the RAF in one way or another.' 

Happy to be here: Speaking  about her accolade, she said: 'I'm looking forward to getting started and working closely with the youths'

Brave face: Carol and 'Duffy', as he is known to his friends, met through her charity work with the RAF and were friends for several years before embarking on a relationship in 2012

One onlooker, whose son was among the cadets, said: 'Carol seemed delighted with the accolade and looked much younger than 53. She’s never looked better and was really enjoying herself.

'You couldn’t wipe the smile off her face and had time for all of the young cadets that wanted to meet her. Considering she’s broken up with her partner recently she seemed in great spirits.

'You think the RAF link would have reopened old wounds, but she was really bubbly. Maybe she was just putting on a brave face.' 

In September, Ms Vorderman called time on her relationship with with former Red Arrows squadron leader Graham Duff, who is 14 years her junior.

The couple were last seen in public as they walked the red carpet at the London Palladium on September 3rd.

The pair met through her charity work with the RAF and were friends for several years before embarking on a relationship in 2012.

The father-of-one, known to his friends as 'Duffy', is an RAF pal of Prince William who flew fighter jets in Iraq and joined the Red Arrows in 2008. He left three years later and set up a mobile phone app business. 

Proud team member: Speaking about the latest recruit, Comdt Air Cadets Air Commodore Dawn McCafferty said: 'We are thrilled that Carol has agreed to be our Ambassador. Her legendary mathematics skills and enthusiasm for engineering will inspire our young people'

Getting into the role: Carol has long been associated with RAF linked charities including the Royal Air Forces Association

Her agent John Miles said following the split: 'It’s sad for both of them but Carol felt it had naturally run its course as relationships sometimes do.

'She decided that it would be best to bring it to an end as amicably as possible, so they separated a number of weeks ago.

'It’s difficult when any relationship ends but they have had many great times together, and nobody else is involved on either side. They remain good friends.' 

Ms Vorderman has been married twice before. She first tied the knot at just 24 in 1985 to Royal Navy officer Chris Mather, but the marriage only lasted a year.

She then got hitched in 1990 to management consultant Patrick King with whom she had a daughter Katie, 22, and son Cameron, 17, but the pair broke up ten years later.

Ms Vorderman gained her Private Pilot Licence (PPL) in December 2013 and her night rating in March 2014, and is continuing with higher level pilot qualifications ahead of a planned solo flight around the world in 2015.

She has long been associated with RAF-linked charities including the Royal Air Forces Association, the RAF Benevolent Fund and the Bomber Command Memorial committee.

Moving on: Speaking about the relationship, Carol's agent said: 'It's sad for both of them but Carol felt it had naturally run its course as relationships sometimes do'

She even led the Salute Area in Green Park in London when the Queen unveiled the RAF Bomber Command memorial in June 2012. 

Her two children were both members of the Combined Cadet Force at school, and Carol’s daughter Katie holds an Officer Cadet rank within the Cambridge University Air Squadron. Katie will now have to salute her mum when they meet in uniform.

Commandant Air Cadets Air Commodore Dawn McCafferty said: 'We are thrilled that Carol has agreed to be our ambassador.

'Her legendary mathematics skills and enthusiasm for engineering, combined with her new-found aviation expertise, will inspire our young people and promote the air cadet experience to new audiences.'
