More than half of households make no contribution to the state as a result of Labour’s decision to increase spending on benefits, a report reveals today.

In a 53.4 per cent of homes, state handouts and services now outweigh their tax payments.

In 2001 - prior to Labour’s debt binge - the figure was less than 44 per cent.

Burden: More than half of households make no contribution to the state as a result of Labour's decision to increase spending on benefits, a report reveals today

It had increased by only 0.7 per cent since 1979.

It then exploded after Labour used tax credits and other handouts to drag a huge number of new households into the pay of the State.

The Centre for Policy Studies, which compiled the report, said the situation was ‘unsustainable’.

The think-tank says benefits will have to be slashed, and the pension age increased, to balance the books.

Ryan Bourne, head of economics at the CPS, said: ‘These data show that even before the financial crisis, the Labour government was ramping up spending on cash benefits and benefits in kind without corresponding increases in taxation.

Increase: The proportion of non-retired households receiving a cash benefit other than child benefit rose from 40.3 per cent in 2001 to 44.6 per cent in 2010/11 ¿ an increase of over a million households

‘This was not redistribution from rich to poor, but redistribution from the future to the present. It felt good at the time, but given the government doesn’t have its own money, was unsustainable.’

The study, based on figures from the Office for National Statistics, shows the government is becoming ever more reliant on the taxes paid by higher earners.

Only the wealthiest 20 per cent of society are paying significantly more to the state - £20,125-a-year - than they receive in benefits and public services.

State services and benefits include unemployment and child benefits and health and education. Taxes include VAT, Council Tax and alcohol duty, as well as payments to HMRC.

Criticism: Last week, Labour leader Ed Miliband criticised the Tories for cutting the top rate of tax from 50 to 45 per cent for the highest earners

Between 2001 and last year, around three million more households became net recipients of the state.

Over this period, middle-income households have moved from being significant net contributors to the state to significant net recipients - taking out £4,589 more than they put in.

In 1990, middle income households faced an effective tax rate of 8.2 per cent.

But by 2010/11 this had reversed, the study says. The effective tax rate was minus 20 per cent.

The households with the lowest incomes received £10,153 more in benefits than paid in taxes.

The report acknowledges that at least part of the change in effective tax rates is down to changing demographics, with an increasing proportion of retired households.

But even in non-retired households 39.6 per cent received more in benefits than they paid in taxes - up from 31.7 per cent in 1979 and 29.0 per cent in 2001.

The proportion of non-retired households receiving a cash benefit other than child benefit rose from 40.3 per cent in 2001 to 44.6 per cent in 2010/11 – an increase of over a million households.

Tim Knox, director of the CPS, said: ‘These trends are unsustainable – particularly given the ageing profile of the UK population.

‘Reversing the trend will require implementation of tough policies to get more people into work, to continue the reform of public services, to restrain increases in the cost of benefits payment, and to ensure that enterprise has the freedom to flourish - leading to more growth, more employment and higher wages and salaries.’

It comes at a time when the Liberal Democrats and Labour are insisting the wealthy must do more to help the nation’s finances recover.

Last week, Labour leader Ed Miliband criticised the Tories for cutting the top rate of tax from 50 to 45 per cent for the highest earners.
