An Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear program could trigger a bloody month-long war on multiple fronts, killing hundreds of Israelis or more, the Israeli Cabinet's civil defence chief warned today.

It was the most explicit assessment yet of how the government sees events unfolding in the aftermath of an Israeli attack.

Matan Vilnai, who is stepping down as the 'home front' Cabinet minister to become Israel's ambassador to China, described the scenarios to Israel's Maariv daily at a time of heightened debate about the Iranian nuclear threat.

Vilnai, a retired general who was 
deputy military chief of staff, has spent the past five years overseeing
 upgrades of Israel's civil defence systems, including air-raid sirens, 
bomb shelters and a public alert system.

In the Maariv interview, Vilnai said 
'the home front is ready as never before'. Nonetheless, he said the 
country must be braced for heavy casualties in the case of conflict with
 Iran.

Vilnai said the government has 
prepared for the possibility of hundreds of rockets and missiles falling
 on Israeli population centers each day, with the expectation of 500 
deaths.

'It could be that there will be fewer 
fatalities, but it could be there will be more. That is the scenario 
that we are preparing for according to the best experts,' he said. 'The 
assessments are for a war that will last 30 days on a number of fronts.'

Israel is convinced that archenemy 
Iran is trying to build nuclear weapons, dismissing Tehran's claims that
 its nuclear program is for civilian purposes. Israel considers 
nuclear-armed Iran to be a mortal danger. Iran backs anti-Israel 
militants with funds and weapons, and its leaders often call for 
Israel's destruction.

In his latest pronouncement, Iranian 
Supreme leader Ali Khamenei said Israel will disappear from 'the scene 
of geography.' Addressing war veterans in Tehran on Wednesday, he said 
Iran considers it its 'religious duty to save this Islamic country 
(Palestine) from the clutches of the Zionist occupiers.'

Israel's leaders have indicated an attack is a possibility if they conclude the international community has failed to halt the Iranian nuclear program.

Mr Vilnai did not elaborate on how he reached his assessments, but his office relies on intelligence and other assessments about Iranian weapons capabilities and Israeli susceptibility.

Defence Minister Ehud Barak has also said the Israeli death toll could be in the range of 500 in such a conflict.

'Just as the citizens of Japan have to realise that they can have earthquakes, so the citizens of Israel have to realize that if they live here, they have to be prepared to expect missiles on the home front,' Vilnai said. 'It's not pleasant for the home front, but decisions have to be made, and we have to be ready.'

At a news briefing in Washington on Tuesday, Leon Panetta, the U.S. defence secretary, reaffirmed the U.S. assessment that Israel has not yet decided whether to strike, while the U.S. military chief, Gen Martin Dempsey, echoed a widely held assessment that an Israeli operation would only set back, not destroy, Iran's nuclear project.
