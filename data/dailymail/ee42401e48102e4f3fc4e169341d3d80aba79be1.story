A cluster-balloonist who became the first person to fly the English Channel is taking on the challenge of a lifetime by attempting to cross the entire Atlantic Ocean.

Intrepid Jonathan Trappe, 38, plans to fly an incredible 2,500 miles across the pond next summer in a seven foot lifeboat carried by 365 huge helium balloons.

And the pilot has harnessed the huge public interest in his previous adventures to launch a $300,000 appeal to crowd-fund online the expensive helium and special UV resistant balloons he will need for his record-breaking flight.

Trappe has invested $170,000 into his Atlantic dream, for which he's been training his whole career, and now he's launching a site so ordinary people can play their part this amazing adventure.

The daredevil, from Raleigh, North Carolina, is learning to sail a lifeboat, in case he needs to ditch into the ocean during the danger-filled mission.

The unique gondola will have an open roof for take-off but a canopy to protect Trappe from high-altitude winds and frost bite during the crossing.

He will fly at between 18,000ft  and 25,000ft, beating his previous world altitude record of 21,600ft, and must fly uninterrupted a distance ten times longer than his previous world record of 230 miles in order to succeed.

The adventurer, who holds records for crossing the Alps, flying the most cluster balloons, and the longest distance, has spent his entire career building up to the momentous expedition.

He said: 'I didn't wake up one day and think: 'I'm going to fly across the Atlantic.'

'Every attempt before this was geared towards this flight. I've been training for a long time.'

In May 2010 Trappe became famous worldwide when flew from England to Belgium dangling from scores of helium balloons - just like the Disney 'Up' character Carl Fredricksen.

Now he is ready to take on the Atlantic, a challenge which has called to balloonists for decades, although five others have died in the process, and none have crossed attached to cluster-balloons.

'It's about living an interesting life - for me as the pilot and those watching,' said Trappe.

'So, one day we can look back and say: 'Humankind were able to pull this off. They did it.''

Trappe will set off from Maine, USA, and set a course for Paris, France. But he will be at the mercy of the elements, and may land anywhere from Norway to North Africa, or be forced to abort and ditch into the ocean.

Four meteorologists will work around the clock from a command centre in Wyoming, USA, to help make sure Trappe arrives safely.

'Weather is the most important element of the whole crossing,' said Trappe.

'Two meterologists will focus on short term weather - what I'm facing immediately and helping to foresee danger or conditions that might put me into the ocean.

'The other two will focus on long term weather patterns, and my overall path to the other side.'

He will take oxygen through tubes in his nose and wear a full oxygen mask once he reaches 25,000 feet.

'To climb I'll drop ballast such as sandbags,' he said. 'I'll be equipped with more food and water than I need so I can discard them too.'  

If something goes wrong, Trappe will change out of his UV protection suit into a cold water suit, pop enough balloons to bring the gondola close to the water, and attempt to land in the ocean.

'It would spell the end of the record attempt and could kill me,' he admitted.

'There will be no getting back into the air. But at least I'll be in a boat.'

Trappe's amazing adventure will be immortalised as a television documentary.
