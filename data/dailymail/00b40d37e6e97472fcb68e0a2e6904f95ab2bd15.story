A mother-of-three was sacked from her new job in a department store cafe after customers complained about her tattoo.

Joanne Stronach, 39, who has the positive mantra 'everything happens for a reason' inked on her arm, was just three weeks into a six-month trial in the coffee lounge at Wetherells in Selby, North Yorkshire, when she was told she was unsuitable for the position.

Ms Stronach said she was left 'angry' and 'humiliated' after bosses told her her body art - a celebration of her three children - would offend older patrons at the traditional department store.

Complaints: Mother-of-three Joanne Stronach, lost her job at a Yorkshire department store after customers complained about her 'everything happens for a reason' tattoo

'Fuddy duddies': The 39-year-old was told she didn't fit in with the image of Wetherells department store in Selby, North Yorkshire

Ms Stronach, who has worked in catering and pubs all her life, explained: 'They said I didn't fit in with the image of Wetherells and the older customers don't like tattoos.

'They are all old folks, they are fuddy duddies and they act like its Mr Selfridge. They should just get over it and get in the real world. I was just shocked. They wouldn't even let me wear long sleeves because they said it was unhygienic, even though I wore them until they got me a uniform.

'I was in long sleeves for the first two weeks and then I got my short sleeve shirt in the third week and that's when it all happened.

'I went there to do a job, which I did well as I always do I told the boss of the kitchen, who said it wouldn't matter as long as they are not offensive.

'She said "I've got one on my foot, I don't care".

'There was another girl who worked there who had visible tattoo on her leg.

'The store just never moved with the times and I could feel people watching me,' said Ms Stronach, who added that she felt people were 'looking down on me and being judgemental' when she was told to leave.

Ms Stronach, from Selby, said she had been thrilled to land the job as cafe assistant in Wetherells, which was established in 1898, because she has been going there all her life.

'I 
have got new job starting in two weeks as a carer and the first thing I 
asked was will my tattoos be a problem and they aren't of course,' she said.

The proud mother said her tattoos of hearts, butterflies and stars were her way of celebrating her children Reece, 15, Charlie, 13 and Lacey, four.

Ms Stronach said the words 'Believe everything happens for a reason... just believe' on her arm were especially personal.

'Its a very personal one that means everything I do is because of my love for my children,' she said.

'The
 tattoos were all done by Steve Dagg in Selby. One features my 
daughter's name, Lacey, with a heart, and 'Love' with two hearts and on 
my other arm, it says 'Everything happens for a reason' with 
butterflies.

'I was even told by one customer that she liked my butterfly.

'I know so many people who shop there as I've worked around town for 13 years. None of them seemed to have been offended,' she said, adding that her factory worker boyfriend, 29, had been supportive.

Traditional: Bosses at the department store, which was established in 1898, said Ms Stronach was a 'good worker' but 'unsuitable' for the position

'They are just a part of me and I love them. If I want to 
write something on myself about loving my family then why not?' she said.

Store director Mark Wetherell wished Ms Stronach well for the future but said customer comments had to be taken seriously.

He said: 'We have to look after our customers, they're our lifeline and we have to take their comments very seriously.

'Joanne was unsuitable for this position but we wish her well for the future.'

His
 wife, Rebecca, added: 'Being in the coffee lounge, with food and 
hygiene, there was no actual way of covering the tattoos up.

'It's
 nothing personal, she was a good worker. I would give her a good 
reference, I've no problems there at all. The main issue was her 
personal appearance,' she added.
