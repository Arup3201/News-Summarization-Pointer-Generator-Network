Dozens of Chinese mothers are giving birth to their babies in a house atop a hill in a wealthy neighborhood of Chino Hills, California - and they're paying thousands of dollars for the privilege.

Neighbors say the home is a 'maternity mansion,' a hotel where Chinese women stay for the last few months of their pregnancy so their children are born on American soil - and are therefore American citizens.

Experts say the practice is widespread and that authorities are nearly powerless to stop it. The 14th Amendment guarantees that any person born in the United States is an American citizen and is afforded all the rights granted by the Constitution.

'I do believe they are taking advantage of a loophole that has been found. Because what I understand after doing my research and homework is that it is an epidemic and it's nationwide,' Rossana Mitchell, a Chino Hills resident who is trying to shut down the 'maternity mansion' in her neighborhood, told KABC-TV.

The Chino Hills home is owned by Hai Yong Wu, a Chinese national who operates the website AsiamChild.com.

The website says that for $5,000 to $15,000, Chinese women can stay for the remainder of their pregnancies in the seven-bedroom home and give birth to their child on U.S. soil.

The Chinese-language site also includes tips on how expectant mothers can hide their pregnancies from U.S. customs officials.

The site suggests women wear black and put a backpack or a bag in front of their bulging stomachs.

It also lists the benefits of being a U.S. citizen, including the social safety net, free education and a path for citizenship for the parents when the child turns 21.

'They're selling U.S. citizenship. They're putting a price on it and they're bringing people over here specifically for that reason,' Sandy Hayden, another Chino Hills resident, told KABC.

The city of Chino Hills has issued the owner a cease and desist order - though the only recourse is charging a zoning violation for operating a hotel in a residential area.

Otherwise, the practice appears to be entirely legal.Â 

The concept of 'anchor babies' briefly became an issue during discussions of illegal immigration.

Some conservatives feared illegal Mexican immigrants were having children in the country in an effort to insulate them from deportation.
