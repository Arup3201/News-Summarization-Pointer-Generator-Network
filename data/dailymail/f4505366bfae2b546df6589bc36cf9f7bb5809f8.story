TripAdvisor reviewers have been known for their searing put-downs about everything from dirty sheets to smelly showers.

So the world's bed and breakfast owners could be forgiven for being a little envious of Bindon Bottom.

The Dorset B&B has been named the best in the world by the site's users - after it gained 456 'excellent' reviews, just three 'very good' and not a single negative one.

King of the king-size bed: Dorset's Bindon Bottom has been named the best bed and breakfast in the world by reviewers on the website TripAdvisor, with 456 'excellent' reviews and just three 'very good'

Patriotic: Second placed was the All Seasons Guest House in Filey, North Yorkshire, which despite being in a terraced house got better reviews than a resort with a swimming pool in the Moroccan capital Marrakech

Grandeur: The 200-year-old Historic Oak Hill Inn in Natchez, Mississippi, was the best B&B not in Britain

Majestic: With its design it is unsurprising the Saxon Villa in Robin Hood's Bay, North Yorkshire, came fourth

On the sweeping North Yorkshire coast, Saxon Villa gained 234 excellent reviews and just five 'very good'

Fifth placed was the Baan Malinee Bed and Breakfast in Thailand - though it may cost a little more to get to

The Â£100-a-night home has been flooded with ecstatic reviewers on the website who say it is 'cosy and relaxing' and praising its 'hooting owls, sweeping hills and surging ocean'.

The tiny number of reviews which missed the top slot came from one couple who missed breakfast by accident and another who wanted their room from 2.30pm instead of 4pm.

Opened in the tranquil seaside village of West Lulworth three years ago by former IT worker Clive Orchard and his wife Lisa, the Victorian home is rumoured to have been designed by Thomas Hardy.

The author of Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure based his novels in the fictional county of Wessex, which was based heavily on Dorset and its Jurassic Coast.

One of his poems was set at Lulworth Cove, a stone's throw from the B&B.

Understated: Linnet Hill in the Lake District town of Keswick came sixth, beating a coastal home in South Africa

Riad Alnadine, Marrakech, was seventh looking like a Moroccan palace - but reviewers preferred Britain

Stone: The Scottish architecture of Dumfries House Lodge, Cumnock, helped get it into eighth place

The couple, who have no background in the hotel trade, told the Independent their customers came from as far afield as Australia and New Zealand.

Mrs Orchard added: 'The reviews rave about Clive's breakfast. He goes to a great deal of trouble to get the best local produce.'

This year's top 10 in the website's Travellers' Choice awards was dominated by British B&Bs, with three of them alone in North Yorkshire.

The sweeping beauty of the Lake District and forests of Scotland also feature in a list which includes venues from Morocco to Mississippi.

For some, the world of British B&Bs once had a reputation for nosy landladies and limp breakfasts.

But there has been a surge in popularity for stay-at-home tourism amid the recession, with families looking to cut back on their budgets.

So while the hotel industry was once immortalised in comedies like Fawlty Towers, TV shows such as Four in a Bed now pitch B&B owners against each other to provide the best service.

In all, TripAdvisor users put 15 of the top 25 B&Bs in the world in Britain.

That is despite the others including a villa overlooking the crystal-clear waters of the Mediterranean in Greece and a Grand Designs-style glass-fronted home in Cape Town, South Africa.

British venues also beat an Indian paradise in Jaipur - and a home in Thailand with its own outdoor swimming pool.

Floral: In ninth place was the Millgate B&B in Masham, North Yorkshire, amid a surge in stay-at-home tourism

From the windswept west coast of Britain to the sun-baked west coast the United States, rounding off the top 10 was the Arbor Guest House in Napa, California. Britain claimed 15 of the top 25 spots on TripAdvisor
