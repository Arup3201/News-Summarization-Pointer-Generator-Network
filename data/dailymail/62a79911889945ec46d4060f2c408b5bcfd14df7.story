Arsenal new boy Calum Chambers has been a 'good surprise' according to full-back Nacho Monreal.

The 19-year-old signed for the Gunners in a £12million deal despite only spending one season in Southampton's first team squad.

But Monreal believes Chambers has proved his worth at Arsenal, and admitted that he did not know too much about the versatile defender prior to his Arsenal move.

Impressive: Calum Chambers has impressed for Arsenal since his £12m move from Southampton

'Calum has been a good surprise for me because I didn't meet him too much and also he's younger,' Monreal told Arsenal's website. 

'He's played like he's played for a long time in the Premier League. He's a good player and an important player for us now and in the future because he's younger.'

'I think we need a little bit more time because last summer a lot of players were playing in the World Cup and they came back late. 

International: The 19-year-old's performances earned him his first international cap, he came on as a late sub

 'We have signed four or five new players so maybe we need a little bit more time for the players to feel better and their fitness can feel better. I think in the next weeks the team will play better.

'I think Arsenal has done a good job (in the transfer window) because now we have five or six new players who have a very good level. 

'I'm happy with the club and Alexis, Ospina, Calum - we have a lot of hopes for them so I'm happy with the team.' 

Surprise: Nacho Monreal admitted that he was surprised by how good Chambers had been for Arsenal
