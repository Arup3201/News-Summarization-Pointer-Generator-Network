It is a dark, rum-soaked story of maritime villainy that has become part of the rich folklore of Cornwall.

But when the BBC wanted to make a new version of Daphne du Maurier’s Jamaica Inn, they chose to film not at the real-life hostelry of the title – which still stands in the heart of Bodmin Moor – but at a dilapidated barn just outside Barnsley.

The decision to shift key scenes in the sinister tale of shipwreckers, contraband and forbidden love about 350 miles north has both angered and baffled locals in Dame Daphne’s beloved Cornwall.

As well as the abandoned West Yorkshire farm buildings standing in for the inn itself, other scenes were filmed in nearby Keighley, while Launceston, the ancient capital of Cornwall, was transposed to Kirkby Lonsdale in Cumbria.

Launceston councillor Jane Nancarrow said: ‘I feel very hurt. We’re very proud down here of Daphne  du Maurier and the Cornwall she immortalised.

‘There is absolutely no doubt in my mind she would have wanted  the TV adaptation to be filmed here. She wouldn’t be resting easy if she knew what was happening.’

The councillor has personal links to the story as she played heroine Mary Yellan in the first stage adaptation of the novel in 1978.

She disputed producers’ claims that Cornwall had become too overdeveloped to recreate Dame Daphne’s landscapes.

‘Launceston is an ancient Saxon 
hilltop town with a Norman castle  so I don’t understand how that is too
 modern,’ she said. ‘We have narrow, cobbled streets and squares.

‘Filming Jamaica Inn in Yorkshire would be like us trying to stage Wuthering Heights. It just wouldn’t be right.’

And out: The historic real-life hostelry of the title, which still stands in the heart of Conrwall's vast Bodmin Moor

The three-part BBC adaptation will air over Easter and stars Jessica Brown Findlay – best known  for playing Lady Sybil in Downton Abbey – as Mary.

Dame Daphne’s son Kits Browning, who fiercely guards his mother’s literary legacy, concedes that the author might well have been ‘a little disappointed’ with the decision to film in Yorkshire.

‘The county meant everything to my mother. It was her sanctuary and also her inspiration,’ he said.

But he added that he was relieved the production otherwise ‘stayed loyal to the book’, saying: ‘I honestly believe the worldwide audience will be carried away with the story, rather than where it was shot.’

Mr Browning said the decision to base the production in the North had been taken because of a grant – said to be £500,000 – from Screen Yorkshire.

‘Perhaps we ought to ask where Cornwall was when the money was needed,’ he asked.

Screen Yorkshire’s Sally Joynson said she was ‘incredibly proud’ to have secured production in the county, while producer David Thompson said: ‘We are delighted to be filming in Yorkshire where we are finding wonderful locations.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Most of the major exterior landscape scenes were filmed in Cornwall.

'Further filming took place in Yorkshire  and Cumbria, which provided excellent crews and a rich variety of locations.’

Dame Daphne died at her home in Fowey, Cornwall, in 1989 at the age of 81.
