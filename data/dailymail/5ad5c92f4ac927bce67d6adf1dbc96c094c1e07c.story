Colombian police intercepted 7 tons of cocaine headed to the Dutch port of Rotterdam in one of the biggest such busts in years.

The narcotics have a street value of at least $250 million and were found stashed in 6,900 tiny packages in a container in this Caribbean port city along with bottles of pineapple conserves.

The packages were stamped with logos such as 'Yamaha' and 'KIA' indicating the various criminal gangs behind the shipment.

Rodolfo Palomino is the head of Colombia's national police and said it was the biggest seizure since 15 tons were found along the Pacific coast in 2005. Colombia is one of the world's largest producers of cocaine.

'Exceptional intelligence work by our public force ... has made for one of the largest drug seizures in the history of Cartagena, where about seven tons of cocaine were seized, and this destabilizes the finances of criminal organizations,' Colombian Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon said.

The minister said the drug was discovered by the local authorities as the ship was to leave the port on the northern Caribbean coast for the Netherlands. It was camouflaged among pineapple pulp.

Colombian police have already seized a total of 25 tons of drugs this year.

This month alone, 42 kilos of drugs was intercepted on a container ship Cold Stream sailing under an Antillian flag.

The ship was coming from Costa Rica and was on its way to the southern Dutch port, Vlissingen.

In March, 240 kilos of cocaine on its way to Belgium was tracked down.
