Sepp Blatter hopes to see Luis Suarez back in action soon.

Suarez was sent home early from the World Cup in shame after biting Giorgio Chiellini in Uruguay's group stage win over Italy.

Given that it was the third time he had bitten a fellow professional, FIFA's disciplinary committee banned the Barcelona forward from 'all football-related activity' for four months.

There was outcry in Uruguay at the ban, but Blatter said the record punishment was completely out of his hands.

The
 FIFA president felt sorry to lose Suarez early from the tournament, and
 he hopes the Uruguay striker will be ready and determined to represent 
his country again soon.

'As a footballer I feel with him that such a 
punishment... it hurts, it hurts,' Blatter said at his final press 
conference in Rio. 'But as FIFA president I have to accept the decisions that are taken by our independent committees.

'I
 do hope that this player will come back to football because on the 
pitch what he has shown so far... I have seen his capacity technically 
and tactically to do what he can do - his smelling of the goal... I do hope he will be back, He is now in one of the greatest clubs in the world.'

Prior
 to the World Cup there were serious fears about security, transport and
 stadia, but Blatter thinks Brazil 2014 passed the test with flying 
colours.

The Swiss rejected an invitation to describe the tournament 
as the best in its 84-year history, but he did give Brazil a glowing 
report - even though it was delivered in a bizarre fashion.

'We were 
calculating last night using all the computers and facebooks and all 
that, and then out of 10 we came 9.25,' Blatter said. 'Brazil has improved since South Africa (whom he rated as nine out of 10). Those who get a clear 10 at universities have deals with the professor.'

In terms of excitement, few World Cups can compete with this one. There were 171 goals - a record only matched by France '98 - and there were plenty of shocks too.

Costa
 Rica's run to the quarter-finals was a genuine good news story, 
Colombia also surprised a few by reaching the same stage while Algeria, 
Switzerland and Mexico also won many admirers.

But the biggest shocks came between the heavyweights of world football. Germany's 7-1 annihilation of Brazil will go down as one of the biggest shocks in World Cup history.

But for Blatter, the highlight was Holland's stunning 5-1 victory over 2010 champions Spain.

'When I saw that match, especially in the second-half, then I felt this was going to be something special,' he said. 'What makes this World Cup very special this time is the quality of the football, the intensity of the games.

'In the first phase teams tend to not to want to lose matches. They used to absorb and not want to lose but this time it was: "boom, boom". It started with aggressive, offensive football and this has been the case the whole through to the end of competition.

'This World Cup was exceptional and the bar has been set very high for Russia to match the same quality.'

On
 the whole, Blatter's final address was an upbeat one. The FIFA 
president brushed off the fact that he was booed at several grounds 
around the country. 'If you are in this business you have to live with that,' he said.

But Blatter did snap at one female reporter when it was put to him that FIFA was corrupt. 'Listen lady, when you speak about corruption then you have to present evidence,' he said.

The
 chief executive of Russia 2018's local organising committee (LOC) 
Alexey Sorokin promised football supporters 'treasures' and 'good 
surprises' at the next tournament.

Two stadiums are ready for the World Cup now. One more is due to be complete in September and a fourth at the start of 2016. The remaining eight venues will be ready in 2017, Sorokin said.

Russia
 has a bad record when it comes to combating racism in football, but 
Sorokin says the LOC will do everything to ensure a trouble-free 
competition. 'We will publish promotional materials, making very firm statements,' Sorokin told Press Association Sport. 'We can ban people who are guilty of wrongdoing from the stadium now.'
