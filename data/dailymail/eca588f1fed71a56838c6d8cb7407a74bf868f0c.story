The Florida socialite at the centre of the sex scandal that brought down former CIA director David Petraeus has sued the FBI and Department of Defense for leaking her name.

Jill Kelley and her husband, Scott, claim the two organisations violated the federal privacy act by wrongly leaking her name.

They are seeking an apology as well as financial compensation.

Kelley, 38, said her involvement in the scandal "shook my life" and "changed our country's leadership"

"Today is an unforgettable day because one year ago threatening emails shook my life, and ultimately changed our country's leadership," Kelley said in an emailed statement.

"It was under the faithful direction of our concerned military leaders that I went to the law enforcement to seek the proper protection for my family, our commanders, and top U.S. officials.

Kelley was well-known amongst military men near MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida

"But, unfortunately, we did not receive the confidentiality and protection. Instead we received highly hurtful and damaging publicity from willful leaks from high level government officials that were false and defamatory."

The couple's lawsuit claims the FBI and the military violated the Privacy Act, the Stored Communications Act and the Fourth and Fifth Amendments by collecting emails Jill Kelley exchanged with military leaders and by releasing her name to the public.

They also filed privacy and defamation actions against several "John Does".

The lawsuit was filed in federal district court in Washington DC on Monday.

The Kelleys are seeking an apology, a declaration that the FBI violated the Stored Communications Act, fair compensation and attorneys' fees, according to their attorneys.

The Kelleys also complain that their "personal emails were wrongfully searched and improperly disclosed," according to the statement.

"As damaging as these wrongful acts were for my family, our military, and our country's leadership ... I was raised with the belief 'if you're not part of the solution, then you're part of the problem.'"

The glamorous mother of two became the centre of one of the biggest sex scandals to hit the US military when she went to the FBI with the emails.

The subsequent investigation led to Broadwell being exposed as Petraeus's mistress and led to his resignation as CIA director.

General John Allen, the top US commander in Afghanistan, became ensnared in the scandal after it was revealed he sent thousands of emails to Kelley.

Kelley knew both men from throwing lavish parties for military chiefs based at MacDill Airforce base near her home in Tampa, Florida.

In the fallout from the scandal, Kelley was stripped of her role as a honorary consul for South Korea.

She was forced to return her vanity car registration plates and banned from MacDill Airforce Base.
