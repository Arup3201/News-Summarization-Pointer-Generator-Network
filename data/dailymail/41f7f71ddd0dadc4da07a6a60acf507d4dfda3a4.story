Old Etonian Charlie Brooks was accused of orchestrating a campaign to 
conceal evidence linking the hacking scandal to his wife but jurors agreed he was too 'daft' to be a criminal.

The
 Old Bailey heard how he made a series of 'cataclysmic' errors when his 
wife was arrested, including hiding his 'rather large' stash of lesbian 
porn.

When Rebekah Brooks returned from Lewisham Police Station she also found her husband was drunk
 and later 'lost it' when he stashed some possessions behind bins below their Chelsea flat.

He
 planned to collect the porn and laptop after police finished searching their London 
home, he said, but a cleaner spotted the bags and handed them to 
detectives.

Protection: Charlie Brooks was accused of orchestrating a campaign for hiding materials from detectives to protect his wife, former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks, but his defence claimed he was 'daft', not a criminal

Photographs of the bags and lists of 
their contents were shown to the trial jury. Titles of the DVDs listed 
included Instant Lesbian, Bride of Sin, and Lesbian Psychodrama volume 2
 and 3.

They also saw CCTV of him wandering through the underground car park with the bags, and then leaving without them.

Ms
 Brooks told the jury: 'He said he had hidden a rather large porn collection.

'I
 just lost it, I couldn't believe it. It sounded like a monumental 
cock-up, - the idea that the police were going to arrest him, I had just
 been arrested.

'It was the final straw of quite a cataclysmic few days.'

Mr Brooks later said he only hid a stash of
 lesbian porn to avoid police finding it and leaking 
details of his 'smut' to the press.

He claimed he wanted to avoid a 'Jacqui Smith moment' 
for his wife - a reference to the former Labour Home Secretary's 
embarrassment when her husband watched a sex film later claimed on her 
expenses.

Mr 
Brooks told the jury he 'incredibly stupidly' decided to hide a bag 
containing explicit DVDs and a case with a laptop inside, but claims it 
was not cover to up a crime.

His defence said he was 'not academically gifted' and one friend described how he once downed an entire pint of washing up liquid in a bid to cure
 a particularly bad hangover - an example of his lack of common sense, his defence team said.

Evidence: CCTV images allegedly showing Charlie Brooks hiding evidence while wife Rebekah was being questioned by police were shown to the jury in the hacking trial in January

Shown to the jury: A brown leather satchel handed into police by a building manager after being discovered by a cleaner on July 18 2011. It was found to contain a laptop and porn belonging to Charlie Brooks

But the prosecution painted a very different picture, and accused Mr Brooks of masterminding 'Operation Blackhawk' on July 17 2011, the day Mrs 
Brooks was arrested by detectives 
investigating alleged phone hacking at The News of the World.

A security team marshalled Charlie Brooks used codewords from Hollywood movies as they tried to dispose 
of incriminating evidence, the Old Bailey heard.

News
 International workers took computers and documents from the couple's 
homes in London and Oxfordshire to keep it out of the hands of the 
police investigating phone hacking, the jury was told.

The
 material was then stashed in a black bag and hidden behind a bin 
outside the Brooks's Chelsea flat by a security guard pretending to be a 
pizza delivery worker, the prosecution said.

After
 making the drop in an underground car park he texted a colleague to 
say: 'Broadsword to Danny Boy. Pizza delivered and the chicken is in the
 pot' - a reference to war film 'Where Eagles Dare' starring Richard 
Burton and Clint Eastwood.

His
 accomplice then replied and called police 'f******* amateurs', 
believing they had successfully hidden the material but it was found by a
 cleaner and handed to police, the court heard.Â 

Brooks
 was also accused of asking for help from wife's head of security at 
News International, Mark Hanna, and her PA Cheryl Carter to dispose of 
laptops and notepads on the eve of her arrest.

The trio was accused of moving evidence while police searched various places.

The jury heard 
that after Mrs Brooks was arrested, she and her husband Charlie, and Hanna, arrived later to collect the bin 
liner, but panicked when they could not find it.

The court also heard Rebekah Brooks ordered the destruction of incriminating
 evidence when she was due to be arrested over phone hacking and 
corruption.

The
 45-year-old former News International chief executive allegedly 
orchestrated an elaborate cover-up operation to 'spirit away' notebooks 
and computers from the police.

She
 instructed her personal assistant Cheryl Carter to retrieve seven boxes
 of notebooks in a bid to stop them falling into police hands and these 
'have not been seen again', the jury was told.

Mrs Carter denied the claims and said unaware Brooks was being investigated by police until two days before she was actually arrested.
