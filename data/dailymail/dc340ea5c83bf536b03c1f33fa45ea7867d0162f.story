A 23-year-old black man has been charged in the grisly murder of a 67-year-old white supremacist in Brandon, Mississippi.

Vincent McGee, an ex-convict, pleaded guilty to manslaughter, arson and burglary charges in connection with the murder of Richard Barrett in rural Mississippi in April 2010.

Mr McGee, who had originally been charged with capital murder, maintained that Mr Barrett had made sexual advances towards him.

He had also told the media, shortly after Mr Barrett’s death, that he was unaware of the man’s white supremacist views.

Mr Barrett, whose body was found beaten, burned, and stabbed 16 times, was the outspoken founder of a Mississippi-based segregationist group named the Nationalist Movement and ran a school for skinheads. He travelled the country promoting his views.

Authorities say that Mr McGee, who had burns covering 35 per cent of his body, set a fire in order to conceal the murder.

Mr McGee, who had been held without bond since his arrest days after the murder, was sentenced to 65 years in prison by Circuit Judge William Chapman. The sentence includes 20 years for manslaughter, 20 years for arson, and 25 years for burglary.

'It is highly unlikely,’ said district attorney Michael Guest, that ‘Mr. McGee will ever leave the penitentiary.’

Mr McGee lived on the same road as Mr Barrett. Mr McGee’s mother told authorities that her family was acquainted with the victim, and that he had socialized at their home for an hour on the night of his death.

Mr McGee and prosecutors did not agree as to why Mr Barrett had been killed. Though he provided inconsistent answers as why he went to Mr Barrett's house the day of the killing, Mr McGee did maintain that Mr Barrett made sexual advances.

In one statement, he claimed that he had gone to Mr Barrett’s house to use his computer on the day of the killing.

In another statement, Mr McGee claimed he went to the home to collect payment owed for yard work. He also said that he had hit and stabbed Mr Barrett after he had taken down his pants and asked for a sex act.

Shortly after the murder, however, the district attorney said that robbery was a motive and that Mr McGee had some of Mr Barrett's possessions, including a pistol and a wallet.

The case did not produce evidence that the crime was related to Mr Barrett’s white supremacist views.

The prosecution charged Mr McGee as a habitual offender, noting previous crimes including assaulting a police officer, grand larceny and a parole violation.

The district attorney said that movement toward a guilty plea came earlier this week. However, the agreement wasn't made until late Wednesday, when his staff decided to accept the plea if Mr McGee agreed to maximum sentences on each of the three charges.
