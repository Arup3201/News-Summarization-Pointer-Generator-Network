An apartment from The Block television show was bought by one of two men involved in a $7 million insider-trading scheme to bring 'a cloak of respectability' to the shady scam. 

Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions Robert Bromwich, SC, told the Victorian Supreme Court the case was the worst instance of 'naked greed' insider trading in Australia's history, and that both Lukas Kamay and Christopher Hill had to receive significant jail sentences, The Age reported.

Kamay, 26, a former NAB banker, and his co-offender, former Australian Bureau of Statistics worker Christopher Hill, 25, were in court following a two-day plea hearing that finished on Thursday. Sentencing has been reserved until the New Year.

Kamay, of Clifton Hill, who successfully bid $2,375,000 for a Melbourne apartment from the reality TV show The Block in April, pleaded guilty to insider trading, money laundering and identity theft charges. While Hill, of Brighton, pleaded guilty to insider trading and misuse of public office charges.

Kamay, 26, and Christopher Hill, 25, met at Monash University in 2007 where they both studied commerce and economics degrees 

Mr Bromwich  said Kamay went to the auction of the three-bedroom Albert Park loft, designed by twins Alisa and Lysandra Fraser on The Block, on April 8 and successfully bid almost $2.4 million for it.

He said Kamay deliberately did not conceal his identity when buying the apartment because the purchase gave his crimes 'a cloak of respectability'.

Kamay said it all eventually took its toll on his health and he couldn't sleep. He was 'in a hole' when he decided to buy the apartment from The Block, The Age reported.

The prosecutor told the court Kamay and Hill decided to set up the scheme between May and July, 2013, with the aim of making a $200,000 profit in a year to split between them – Hill had met Kamay at Monash University in 2007 where they both studied for commerce and economics degrees.

Hill used his position at the ABS headquarters in Canberra to send Kamay employment, trade and retail figures before any details were released to the market, the court heard.

Kamay, based at NAB in Melbourne, used the data that was passed on by Hill to make trades on currency markets based on which direction the Australian dollar was expected to go.

Mr Bromwich said Kamay ended up making a profit of $7.2 million but did not inform Hill about all the money that he had made in their time working together in this way.

Hill pocketed a total of $19,500 in cash. He spent $10,000 and police later seized $9500, which they found in his apartment.

Kamay said the culture at the NAB at the time was to make money and be successful which, in the end, consumed him. 

However, the prosecutor said there were no redeeming features about the two young men's offending apart from the fact that they had pleaded guilty. 

No expense was spared by the Fraser twins when they renovated the apartment
