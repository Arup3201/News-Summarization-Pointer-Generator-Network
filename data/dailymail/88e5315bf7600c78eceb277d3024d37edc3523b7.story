Killer Jeremy Bamber has lost the first stage of his latest legal battle over his convictions for murdering five members of his family more than 25 years ago.

A High Court judge in London has rejected Bamber's bid for a judicial review of an earlier decision not to refer his case back to the Court of Appeal for the safety of his convictions to be looked at once more.

The 51-year-old is serving a whole life term for murdering his wealthy adoptive parents, his sister and her two children in a remote Essex farmhouse in 1985. He has always protested his innocence.

Killer: Bamber, seen left in 2011, and being taken away by police following his murder trial in 1986, was seeking a judicial review of an earlier decision not to refer his case to the Court of Appeal

The decision not to refer Bamber's case back to the Court of Appeal was made earlier this year by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), an independent body which investigates possible miscarriages of justice.

A Judicial Office spokeswoman today confirmed that a judge had turned down Bamber's application for permission for a judicial review.

It is still open to Bamber to seek to renew his application before the full court.

Bamber, who has been behind bars for over 25 years for the 1985 killings, claims his schizophrenic sister Sheila Caffell shot her family before turning the gun on herself in the farmhouse in Tolleshunt D'Arcy, Essex.

He was convicted in 1986 of killing his parents June and Neville, his sister Ms Cafell, and her six-year-old twin sons Daniel and Nicholas on August 7, 1985.

Bamber's latest request for an appeal was based on a fresh analysis of three burn marks found on his father and gunshot wounds on his sister which suggested they were not killed with a weapon fitted with a silencer, which suppresses the sound of a gunshot.

His trial in 1986 was told he had shot his family using a weapon fitted with such a device, and that he had later removed it.

When announcing its decision not to refer the case to the Court of Appeal in April the CCRC said that, despite a lengthy and complex investigation, it 'has not identified any evidence or legal argument that it considers capable of raising a real possibility that the Court of Appeal would quash the convictions'.

In July this year it emerged the mass
killer was again pursuing a challenge against the decision to hand him a
whole-life term because it is 'inhuman and degrading'.

Bamber
appealed after Europe's human rights judges ruled in January that 
Britain's most notorious killers could be kept behind bars for the rest 
of their lives.

The ruling will be tested in 
Strasbourg's Grand Chamber, the appeal court of the European Court of 
Human Rights, next month.

Two
other British killers - Douglas Vinter, who stabbed his wife in 2008, 
and Peter Moore, who killed four men in 1995 - will also have their 
appeals heard in cases that will test whether the UK's law allowing the 
most dangerous offenders to be sentenced to whole-life tariffs is cruel.

In 2009, Bamber lost a
Court of Appeal challenge against the order that he must die behind 
bars. He has twice lost appeals against conviction.

He is being held at Full Sutton prison in York.
