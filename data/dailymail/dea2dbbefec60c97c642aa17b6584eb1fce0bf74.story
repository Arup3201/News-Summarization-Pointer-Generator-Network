A Seattle family enjoying a Friday morning beach day were surprised to see a pig swimming in the ocean a few feet away from them.

Erin Schwartz and her family were enjoying their last day of vacation on Sullivan's Island in South Carolina when they spotted something swimming they thought might be a dog.

However, when Erin Schwartz's husband Eric saw a snout coming from the water he realized it wasn't a dog but a hog.

Getting some sun: This little piggy mysteriously ended up on a beach in South Carolina

'My husband spotted it first and at first thought it was a dog,' said Schwartz

'It wasn't until we saw the snout and tail that my husband said, ‘Is that a pig?'

Erin and Eric Schwartz were out that day with their two children Luca and Ruby who were also impressed to see a pig splashing around in the ocean.

The pig was about 20 to 30 feet away from the Schwartz family when they first saw it.

The Schwartz's only spent 13 days in South Carolina but the highlight of their whole entire trip was seeing the pig swim.

'Just for an hour, all of the sudden we see this pig...It was a crazy last hour,' Schwartz said.

'It was the highlight.'

When the pig neared the beach, a family was able to safely bring the pig back to the shore.

'It looked like it had been swimming for some time,' Schwartz said.

'It looked tired and disoriented,' he continued.

Police responded to a call about the 25-pound pig and were able to catch it.

Witnesses recall seeing a second pig but only one was captured.

'It is likely that the hog(s) were caught in the current in the upper reaches of the Wando and/or Cooper Rivers and came ashore at the first available location. This often occurs with wild animals but is more common with deer and alligators,' said the town administrator Andy Benke.

It's likely that the hogs got caught in a river which leads to an ocean
