A 79-year-old substitute teacher in New Hampshire has chosen to quit her job rather than delete thousands of students and friends from her Facebook profile.

'Today will be my last day at Stevens High,' Carol Thebarge wrote on her page. 'I was given an ultimatum; to either delete every 
student from my Facebook page and do not post pictures of them, or be 
terminated.'

She has been a paraprofessional and substitute teacher for 35 years with assignments at 32 different schools.

Popular substitute teacher Carol Thebarge chose to resign rather than delete students from her Facebook page

She started substitute teaching at 44 after one of her grandchildren passed away.

She is also active as a wedding planner and working on a certification for substance abuse counseling.

Thought not certified for teaching, Thebarge was put in charge of classrooms as varied as technical or vocational classes. In cases where she was prevented from teaching because of rules - such as shop - she taught motivational subjects about truth, character, and honesty.

She said she rigidly monitors who wants access to her page, blocking students if they act in ways she deems unbecoming.

To be added, you must have been one of her students and you must have a picture on Facebook so she can confirm their identity.

Thebarge said students would privately message her on Facebook seeking for help when they were depressed or feeling bullied

'I've had a wonderful career,' she said. 'I have no resentment for their policy; they have to do what they have to do. I didn't want it to end this way.'

She claimed school officials gave her an ultimatum after a math teacher, Christopher LeBlanc, was fired and charged with four counts of felonious sexual assault on a 14-year-old girl in his class. 

'Don't penalize me for someone else,' she told the New Hampshire Union Leader. 'I am offended that I followed that by just a week.'

She was first instructed to remove students from her page several years ago but after deleting 50 names said the feedback made her reconsider.

'I had  students that were asking me what did they do wrong ...,'  she said. 'I hid my list, but then I realized I had always taught them to 
'Live their truth' and I unblocked, and she (the administrator) left me 
alone.'

Thebarge also said students would message her on her Facebook privately to seek advice about being bullied or depressed.

Her retirement announcement has received more than 1,000 likes and more than 200 comments.

While some students told her they would protest the ultimatum, she said she'd rather they stay in class.

And though she might continue substitute teaching in another district, she will not be back in any of the familiar settings.

'I don't want to return to that school,' she said. 'It's not that I don't want to be with the kids, but the administration really let me down.'

Claremont School Board policy bans teachers from 'friending' students on social media, said Middleton McGoodwin, the school superintendent.

McGoodwin met with her last week to ask for her to reconsider, and told reporters she was a 'very caring person.'

However they cannot allow exceptions to the rules.

While Thebarge said she may continue substitute teaching it would not be in any of the former schools she frequented

'In truth, being a caring, lovely woman doesn't give you immunity to ignore a school board policy that's designed to protect everyone,' he said.

McGoodwin met with about 25 students Friday for 90 minutes to discuss the decision.

'Kids have passion and emotion, and they 
didn't understand why we could be so heartless to a kind lady,' he said.

He also said the decision was entirely Thebarge's choice as she had no contract with the school and could not be terminated. Instead they simply will not call her when substitute positions are available.

LeBlanc's arrest has made school personal far more sensitive to professional boundaries.

As of Saturday, a petition to 'reinstate Carol Thebarge' had more than 675 signatures.
