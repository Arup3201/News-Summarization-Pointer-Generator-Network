Samantha Cameron dressed to impress as she attended Burberry's London Fashion Week show today. 

The Prime Minister's wife took her seat on the front row wearing a pretty red sleeveless dress.

But as she watched the models strut down the catwalk showcasing the spring/summer collection from Christoper Bailey, she may have realised that her footwear wasn't quite on trend.

Fashionista: Samantha Cameron on the front row of the Burberry show today sat next to Natalie Massenet and Caroline Rush

While the 43-year-old wore cream sandals with a medium-sized heel, all of the Burberry models on the runway wore flats. 

The models including Sam Rollinson, Suki Waterhouse, Jourdan Dunn and Charlotte Wiggins all wore their glamorous dresses with trainers or pumps.

Also on the front row for the show at Kensington Gardens was model Cara Delevingne - who had got the style memo about casual footwear.

She wore a revealing navy suit by Burberry with colourful chunky trainers.

Wouldn't miss this show: Samantha, who is as an ambassador for the British Fashion Council, has long been a fan of Burberry designs

But Samantha could rest assured that she wasn't the only fashionistas not in on the flat shoe trend.

Kate Moss also wore heeled sandals as she arrived with Cara and watched the stellar show from the front row. 

The lucky viewers with coveted tickets to the LFW must-see event were treated to a sumptuous selection of layered tulle dresses, cropped denim jackets and classic trenches inspired by the birds and the bees.

Walk on the wild side: The spring/summer 15 collection from Christoper Bailey was inspired by nature

Insects of Britain was Bailey's point of reference and he translated this onto the catwalk via butterfly printed satin skirts, bags emblazoned with hand-drawn honey bees and his iconic trench reworked for SS15 in every colour in the rainbox from dragonfly blue to beetle green.

Suki Waterhouse showed us how to do organza for spring as she and the other Burberry girls stomped the catwalk in the most beautiful layered tulle dresses in poppy rosehip, which were sometimes teamed with lilac suede cropped jackets.

Not the only one: While Cara Delevingne was of course on trend in trainers, Kate Moss also wore heels like SamCam

Waists were nipped with cobweb tulle belts, creating a waspish silhouette adhering to the theme of the show.

Samantha, who is as an ambassador for the British Fashion Council, has long been a fan of Burberry designs.

For the 2012 royal wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, she chose to wear a vibrant green dress from the British fashion house which she later auctioned for charity.
