A Labrador rescued from wild seas and certain death by lifeboat crews has been reunited with its owners.

Mike and Caroline Jenner feared their pet Quila had drowned after she was swept out to sea by the tide at Sea Palling, Norfolk.

And the couple were thrilled when the eight-year-old animal was dramatically saved by Happisburgh, Norfolk Lifeboat crew - who found her cowering on a reef.

Saved: Mike and Caroline Jenner thought their pet Quila had drowned after she was swept out to sea off the Norfolk coast

Mr Jenner, 71, of Stalham, said: 'It was going to be a terrible, miserable Christmas - but that was swept away and everything is wonderful now.'

Mr Jenner had taken Quila for her regular stroll on Sea Palling beach with the dog's daughter Sunni early on Sunday morning.

The two dogs got excited after spotting a seal pup in the water and leapt in after it.

To the rescue: RNLI staff managed to save this terrified animal after it was swept away off the coast of Norfolk

Approach: The female's owner was walking along Sea Palling beach when the animal disappeared. RNLI staff then began a search for the dog, finding her on these rocks after hearing barking

SOS: Happisburgh, Norfolk, RNLI spotted the animal half a mile out to sea standing on some rocks, pictured

Despite frantically whistling and shouting, the dog owner could not get them back.

'I managed to get Sunni back, I was waist high in water by then,' he said.

'I tied her up and then tried to get Quila, who was getting further and further out and totally ignoring me.'

Mr Jenner managed to get two kayakers to try to bring the stricken dog in.

Lucky: The animal's owner had already searched for the dog with two kayakers before the RNLI were called

Attached: Staff aboard the boat secured the shivering animal, latching a rope onto her collar

All aboard: Staff then gently pulled the animal - who was soaked through - on to their lifeboat

But terrified Quila was dragged out to sea - and quickly vanished out of sight.

The coastguard was alerted and lifeboats sent out a search party.

But Mr Jenner admitted he had 'given up hope' as he returned home to tell his wife Caroline the heartbreaking news.

'I told her I'd lost Quila at sea and feared she was drowned,' said Mr Jenner.

'There was no easy way of saying it - it was horrible.'

But then a neighbour spotted a sign on the beach saying a golden Labrador had been rescued.

Easy does it: The female is lifted to the warmth of the boat by a team member

Good girl! The animal looks a little relieved to be off the rocks and with a staff member

Mike contacted the coastguard and was put in touch with Sea Palling lifeboat.

A
 crew member had taken frozen Quila - who had lost her name tag with her
 owners' phone number on during her nightmare ordeal - home to get her 
warm after she suffered hypothermia.

'I didn't think I'd ever see our Quila again,' said Mr Jenner

'It ended happily ever after.'

Mrs
 Jenner, 61, added: 'We're over the moon. We really can't thank 
Happisburgh and Sea Palling rescue enough, they were absolutely 
fantastic.'

Happy to be home: Quila, left, and her daughter Sunni, take a well-earned rest
