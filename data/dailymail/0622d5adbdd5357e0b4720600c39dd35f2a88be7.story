Alan Pardew and Newcastle take on England new boy Saido Berahino on Sunday – but the United boss believes he boasts a pair of Three Lions hopefuls of his own.

Midfielder Jack Colback was included in Roy Hodgson’s squad in August only to withdraw because of injury, while defender Steven Taylor was an unused substitute against San Marino last year.

The Magpies duo have not been involved since those respective calls and remain uncapped.

Pardew, though, feels both players can again stake a claim for international honours this season.

‘Could Jack play for England? For sure,’ said Pardew, whose side travel to West Brom on the back of four straight wins.

‘He’s been a significant part of our season in a positive way. If I was to mark him I’d say seven out of 10, but I think he can get eights and nines here.

‘I’ve really enjoyed watching him play. I love his mentality. All he needs to do is build on what he’s done. To come from our big rivals (Sunderland) and to have played the way he has is a real testament to his character.’

Taylor, meanwhile, has played every minute of United’s last three wins in the Premier League having previously been out of the side.

And Pardew said: ‘You can’t argue with his record (since he came into side).

‘He’s a player that, when he’s confident, can get in the England squad, which he did during my time here.

‘The key to Steven is having a sustained run and staying injury-free, which he is having at the moment. When he gets his confidence he’s an outstanding centre-half.’

Colback, though, perhaps faces a tougher task at the heart of England’s midfield.

‘We’ve got a good batch of central midfield players in the England squad, so Jack has good competition,’ Pardew added.

‘But I’ve got no problems with Roy’s selection, and neither has Jack.

‘He’s a very simple player to manage. He makes the game simple. He’s low maintenance – he comes in, does his work, is terrific and goes home – lovely.’
