Tunisia and Cape Verde Islands shared the spoils in their opening match in Ebebiyin, as all four teams in Group B go into the second round of games level on a single point.

In a game lacking quality, Mohamed Ali Moncer put the Tunisians ahead after 70 minutes, before Heldon Ramos equalized from the penalty spot to secure Cape Verde a deserved draw.

The spot-kick was heavily disputed by the Carthage Eagles, who claimed, with some justification, that Heldon both went to ground very easily, and that any contact there came outside the area.

It was perhaps fitting that the first match of this competition to fall below a high standard of play should have seen the result settled by the competition's first seriously controversial decision.

Matters were not helped by the pitch, laid shortly before the tournament began and obviously not up to the rigours of back-to-back matches. At one point, when Ali Moncer slid to get onto the end of a cross he brought up a divot more than a foot long.

Tunisia, favourites to top the group before play started, did little to justify the tag, save for a short spell midway through the second half in which they hit the bar, and scored the goal.

But, Cape Verde had by far the better chances, particularly in what was a decidedly lacklustre first half.

In just the second minute Fernando Varela thundered a header against the post, with Aymen Mathlouthi in the Tunisia goal well beaten. 

For the first time in the tournament both the intensity of the football, and the atmosphere, was lacking. The Blue Sharks’ front three attempted to inject some life into it. Heldon Ramos and Kuca, two wingers based in Portugal, in particular posed a threat with their pace and trickery.

Kuca was the first to test Mathlouthi in the 18th minute, stinging the palms of the Tunisia keeper at the near post, moments after a jinking run that roused the sleepy crowd.

On the half hour mark the lively Heldon, who plays his club football at Sporting Lisbon, got free down the right, avoiding a dangerously high foot from Aymen Abdennour, but when he picked out Djaniny the striker could only fire low at Mathlouthi.

Soon after Cape Verde keeper Josimar had to be alert to dive at the feet of Mohamed Ali Moncer, but the Tunisians carried little in the way of goal threat.

The Islanders, the smallest country in Nations Cup history, continued to come forward, Babanco playing a lovely pass for Djaniny down the right hand channel five minutes later, but the striker couldn’t seem to make up his mind between crossing for a well-placed Heldon, or going for goal. In this end, his attempt floated close to the far post, over Aymen Mathlouthi, but just beyond the target.

Then, seven minutes before half time, Tunisia survived a moment of controversy, when Ali Maaloul avoided giving away a penalty, or receiving a red card, when he brought down Heldon, who was bursting through on goal.

Nuno Rocha picked out his forward with a lovely pass, and when the Sporting man was brought down on the edge of the box, Gabonese referee Eric Castane correctly awarded a free kick, despite claims it was inside the penalty area. However, the full back was fortunate not to be shown a card, given the run Heldon was making towards goal.

From the resultant free-kick Babanco smashed a shot into the wall, sparking a goalmouth scramble from which Kuca poked wide.

Kuca had the second half’s first good chance, almost capping off a flowing break from Cape Verde, but having beaten Mathlouhi he saw Sayim Ben Youssef clear off the line.

Tunisia finally began to threaten soon after the hour mark. First Chickhaoui beat Josimar to a free kick only to see his header rattled the woodwork. The ball was bundled in from the rebound, but by that time the referee had spotted a foul.

Seven minutes later they had the ball in the net again, this time legally. Full back Ali Maloul got forward down the left and slid an inviting ball across goal, which Ali Moncer converted at the far post, firing into the roof of the net.

The celebrations were shortlived however, and despite the controversial nature of the penalty, it was no less than Cape Verde deserved.
