A one-month-old piglet called Yoda miraculously avoided the slaughterhouse and has found a new home in an animal sanctuary in Canada.

Yoda escaped his fate on the dinner plate when he fell off a truck that was taking him and other piglets to be readied for their eventual demise.

The animal had suffered scrapes and bruises from the fall, but was in good overall physical health.

Brenda Bronfman, the founder of Wishing Well Sanctuary in Bradford, Ontario, Yoda’s new home, said the pig was ‘emotionally traumatised’ from the experience.

Lucky: Yoda the pig fell of a truck heading for the slaughterhouse and survived. Now he's living in an animal sanctuary in Ontario, Canada

New life: Yoda, not pictured, was being transported to the slaughterhouse with a truckload of other pigs but his fall saved his life

Second chance: Yoda did not end up at the slaughterhouse like his unfortunate fellow pigs

‘Being in the truck with all the pigs that were on their way to a finishing barn, which is where they fatten them up prior to going to the slaughterhouse,’ Bronfman told ABC News.

‘He got very lucky by falling out, that's for sure,’ she said.

People who were following the trailer that was carrying the pigs ‘saw the piglet sneak through a hole and fall off the trailer’, said Joyce Kemp, the Quebec provincial police spokeswoman.

The CBC said police found the pig wandering on a highway on September 18.

Bronfman said she first learned about the piglet when an animal control officer in Quebec sent her an email describing the animal's plight.

Even though the sanctuary was full, Bronfman consulted with her board and several people pitched in to drive the pig from Quebec to Ontario.

‘We just couldn't let this little piglet either suffer or not find a home,’ she said. ‘After all that he'd been through, we wanted to make sure that he had a loving home.’

Lots of love: Brenda Bronfman, the founder of Wishing Well Sanctuary in Bradford, Ontario, says Yoda will be loved in his new home

The piglet has taken to his new surroundings and interacts well with his caregivers.

‘He's just adorable,' said Bronfman.

‘He'll fall asleep in your lap. He just loves to play and cuddle,’ she said. ‘He loves to give kisses, too, and he likes to get kisses on the tip of his snout.’

And the reason for his Star Wars-inspired name?

‘He seems to have wisdom and he's a little fighter. Plus, his ears kind of look a little Yoda-ish.’

Now about six weeks old, Yoda weighs 15 pounds, Bronfman said. But when he's fully grown, he'll be much bigger.

‘He's come all this way [and] he will be loved forever’.
