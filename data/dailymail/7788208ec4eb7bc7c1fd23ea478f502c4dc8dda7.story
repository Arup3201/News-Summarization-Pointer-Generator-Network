A singer whose moving performance left mourners in tears at the funeral of police officer Fiona Bone hopes to record the song to raise money for the families of fallen officers.

Iona Fisher went from busking to singing Ave Maria for hundreds at Manchester Cathedral after being spotted singing in Ashton town centre.

She performed Beyonce's version of the song at the request of Fiona’s fiancee, Clare Curran, who had hoped to play it at their upcoming wedding.

Now Iona, 21, wants to record the track as a permanent tribute and to raise funds for the charity COPS (Care of Police Survivors).

Fiona,32, who lived in Sale, died in a gun and grenade attack in Mottram alongside 23-year-old colleague Nicola Hughes.

Iona, who lives in Ashton and went to St Damian’s High School, was classically trained at the Royal Northern College of Music.

She works part-time in a shop in between busking and gigs and sang at a community vigil for Fiona and Nicola, but said nothing could compare to Thursday’s performance.

Charged: Dale Cregan has been charged with the murder of both officers, who died in a gun and grenade attack

She said: 'I had met Fiona’s family 
and they had asked me to sing Ave Maria for Fiona and her fiancee Clare.
It was going to be the song they walked down the aisle to when they got
married.

'It was quite daunting but I did put quite a bit of pressure on myself. I just wanted to do my best and make it special for them.

'I have been bombarded with really lovely messages since, especially from police officers.

'They
came up with the idea of releasing Ave Maria as a charity single and I 
really hope it will come off because I think it could raise a lot of 
money.

'It was really 
emotional and the whole experience, performing for Fiona and her family 
and all the police force is something I will never forget. I was really 
honoured to be asked to take part.'

Iona, who was accompanied on piano by her brother Lee, 23, says she is now in talks with various people about recording the song. 

Tameside’s Chief Supt Nick Adderley even tweeted a link to music mogul Simon Cowell.

Dale Cregan has been charged with the murder of both officers.
