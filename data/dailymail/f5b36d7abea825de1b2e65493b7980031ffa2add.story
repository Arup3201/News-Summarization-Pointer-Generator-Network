Charlotte Dawson's family and friends shared memories of happiness and heartbreak at a memorial service held in her honour The Beresford Hotel on Friday.

The star's sisters Robin Barclay and Vicky Dawson brought the ashes of the media personality up on stage at her memorial as they talked about their childhood as well as her cheekiness as a schoolgirl in New Zealand.

Her close friend Alex Perry also gave a touching account of the 'fragile' star as he recalled the woman he knew and loved.

The 47-year-old - who was found dead at her Woolloomooloo home last week - was cremated in private service attended by nine people on Thursday night at Eastern Suburbs Crematorium.

At the gathering on Friday, Vicky had the crowd cheering as she said: 'I hope you can see now how many lives you touched and how loved you were.'

The sisters were some of the first to take the stage at the morning memorial.

They held her ashes in a blue box and said that she was 'here' with her family and friends.

Vicky revealed Dawson was cremated wearing a dress designed by Perry and RenÃ© Caovilla shoes.

Vicky told of the pretty little girl' who was their one-year-old 'baby sister' when their father died, who grew up into 'cheeky, disobedient teenager'.

Vicky said although Charlotte had despaired when their late mother began to suffer from dementia, she was her usual irreverent self at the funeral, joking that their mum looked as 'if she might have had work'.

Perry too got laughs from the room as he spoke about some of Dawson's more outrageous behavior.

He lamented about her slapstick pranks and also sneaking out of hospital for a cigarette.

But it wasn't all smiles, with the celebrity designer saying: 'There was a beautiful, fragile girl underneath that wanted to be loved'.

He added that she 'had her heart broken in a very public break up' with Olympic swimmer Scott Miller, but didn't mention him by name.

Perry said it was fitting they were all there 'on the eve of Mardi Gras' as she was an outspoken ambassador for the event.

Guests - which included media personalities and sporting stars - cried as a montage of childhood pictures of Dawson were played to Cyndi Lauper's classic Time After Time.
