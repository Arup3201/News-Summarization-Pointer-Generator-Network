A group of teenagers helped a Florida mother fight off an alleged kidnapper as he tried to snatch her four-year-old daughter and three-year-old nephew from a park playground on Saturday.

'I don't think that they realize they saved two children's lives,' Sharaya Smith said of the strangers after the frightening incident at Lisa Lake Park in New Port Richie.

The 28-year-old was playing with her daughter, Tatiana, and nephew, Dante, on the equipment when Bienvenido Cintron, 34, approached her uttering strange phrases.

'I am Obama!' Cintron screamed, according to a Pasco County Sheriff's Office report. 'I have been sent by God to rid the county of drug dealers and prostitutes.'

Frightened, Smith grabbed the children but the man, dressed in a dirty trench coat and jeans, with long dark hair, pushed her, causing her to lose balance, The Tamba Bay Times reported.

He then tried to wrench the kids from her, grabbing at Dante's arm as he called him a drug dealer and pulling Tatiana's hair as he yelled that she was a prostitute.

Smith managed to shake both children free of Cintron's clutches before running to a lit parking lot as she screamed for help.

Her cries were heard by a group of teenagers, and three of the boys surrounded Smith and the children, forming a human barricade to protect them from Cintron.

Smith's brother, Chad, then drove up to the park and the teenagers escorted Smith, Tatiana and Dante to his car.

After they got in, Cintron circled the vehicle, demanding the toddlers open the doors and when they refused, spat on the vehicle, the Times reported.

Smith said she saw the man headed for the teens as Chad sped off. But Cintron claims the teenagers beat him up.

The man called 911 to his home later that night and officers found him with two black eyes, a bloody nose and a swollen cheek, according to the Times.

But police said they didn't know if the teens he accused of attacking him were the same ones from the park.

Cintron was arrested just after 10 p.m. on charges of attempted kidnapping and burglary.

Smith told the Times the children were shaken up after the incident, and referred to their alleged attacker as a 'bad man' who called them names.

She said she wished she could thank the anonymous teens who helped her in the park.
