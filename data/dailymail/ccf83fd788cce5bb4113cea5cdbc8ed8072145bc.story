Radamel Falcao may not have found a house yet, but he looks completely at home with Manchester United.

The Colombian has been staying at the swanky Lowry Hotel since his deadline day arrival at Old Trafford and his football is as stylish as the five-star decor.

Take just one moment from the match at Leicester, three minutes after half-time. Picked out by Wayne Rooney in the corner of the penalty box, Falcao controlled instantly, almost magnetically.

Allowing the ball to bounce to the optimal height, he extended his leg with nonchalance. The ball cannoned back off the crossbar, Kasper Schmeichel without a hope of stopping it. He barely even saw it.

Falcao didn't score during his 70 minutes at Leicester - it's a matter of time before the goals start to flow - but his influence in leading United's attack is there for all to see.

United are starting to feel themselves again, going forward at least. Defensively they were a shambles and they blew a 3-1 lead in embarrassing circumstances, but that formidable forward line is starting to purr again.

The 'Gaal-acticos' are blowing away the dark clouds of the David Moyes era with hurricane force and Leicester certainly found themselves in a whirlwind at times on Sunday. For an hour at least, until United suffered a power cut at the King Power Stadium. 

To their eternal credit, Nigel Pearson's team had hung in there and surged back to claim a famous victory. United were woeful in defence, their expensive attacking players left looking helpless as Leicester split open their defence at will.

Before the miraculous fightback, Falcao, on his first start, had been central to everything good United did. The speed with which he has adapted to life in a red shirt is incredible, it looked like he'd been playing alongside Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Angel di Maria for years.

Twice inside the space of a minute early on, Di Maria tried to locate him with a diagonal ball from the left. It didn't quite come off but the threat was evident as Falcao tangled with Wes Morgan and Liam Morgan.

And his contribution to the opening goal, on 12 minutes, was simply sublime. Collecting the ball wide on the left, he spun Ritchie de Laet as though he was invisible and set off like an express train.

A sumptuous left-footed cross to the back post followed and Van Persie headed in with the aid of a deflection off Moore.

And on the stroke of half-time, a Di Maria ball from the same flank was nearly met by Falcao as he dived forward to meet it.

His primary purpose is to score goals, of course, but Falcao has a much greater value than that.

He will be a key component in United's well-oiled attacking machine. His passing and movement was superb, weaving in and out of the thin blue line.

His industry raises eyebrows too - time after time he rushed back to mug an unsuspecting Leicester player of the ball in the centre of the park.

Although the serious cruciate ligament injury that kept him out of the World Cup is behind him, Falcao is still short of full match fitness and it was unsurprising when Van Gaal replaced him with Adnan Januzaj with 20 minutes to play.

It was at that point United's afternoon imploded. If Van Gaal's attack is the luxury penthouse suite, his defence is the grotty back street hostel.

If United's philosophy this season is to score one more than the opposition, whether that means scoring four, five or six, then at least in Falcao he has someone who will deliver.
