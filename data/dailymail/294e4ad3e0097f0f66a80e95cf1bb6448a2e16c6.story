An Alaskan hotel has designed a unique series of road signs that can help make sure drivers are paying attention on the way up.

The dirt road, called Grande Drive, leads up to the Grande Denali Lodge in Denali, Alaska, CNN reported. The hotel is close to Denali National Park, which includes Mount McKinley.

Road signs along the way include warnings like 'Beware of falling coconuts,' 'Watch for aircraft' and even 'Freeway ends.'

Watch out! One of the signs features a large mosquito carrying someone away

Lighthearted: This sign includes the slogan 'No passing on curves'

Snail-paced: One sign encourages drivers to move along at just 13 miles per hour

Others feature humorous images, like a large mosquito picking a man up into the air and a moose staring down a car.

Dee Dee Kay, director of sales at the lodge, told MailOnline the signs were designed by Dennis Brandon, who works as a consultant for the lodge's parent company.Â 

'It is a 5 minute drive up the side of Sugarloaf Mountain [to the hotel],' Kay said. 'There are several switchbacks and for some a bit of an adventure. The signs provide a conversation piece and give our guests a chuckle.'

Kay said there are no signs inside the hotel, but that the sign with the large mosquito is available for sale in magnet form.

'The [road sign] collection has been added to each year,' Joe Merrill, the hotel's general manager, told CNN. 'The ideas [for the signs] now come out of different peoples' minds.'

'I guess they're also a way to take peoples' attention away from the side of the road with the cliffs,' Merrill also said. 'I'm pretty sure we're not done with the signs. Stay tuned to see what our warped minds come up with next.'
