Tough new Alabama immigration laws are forcing even legal migrants workers to flee the southern state over fears they will be deported.

Regulations introduced last week seen as the toughest in America have caused a mass exodus in the state, which experts say could cripple Alabama's economy.

A staggering one quarter of commercial building workers are thought to have left the state since tight regulations were introduced.

Masses of legal Hispanic workers are leaving Alabama because family members and friends don't have the correct paperwork and they fear they could be jailed.

Many are fleeing to Tennessee or Washington, while those who are staying are 'trying not to go out as much'.

Under strict rules brought in last week, schools have to check the immigration status of newly enrolled children.

Immigration laws in Alabama also allow police to ask for papers showing citizenship or immigration status during traffic stops if they have a 'reasonable suspicion' that the person may be in the country illegally.

As a result, over 800 Hispanic pupils have either withdrawn or not returned to state schools, while an estimated one quarter of the commercial building work force has left since last week.

Elsewhere, one fruit farmer told how just eight of a near 50-strong workforce returned to work last week.

Rick Pate, the owner of a commercial landscaping company in Montgomery, lost two of his most experienced workers, who were in the country legally.

He said: 'They just feel like there is a negative atmosphere for them here. They don't feel welcome. I don't begrudge them. I'd feel nervous, too.'

Commercial construction is a more than $7 billion-a-year industry in Alabama.

The law targets employers by forbidding drivers from stopping along a road to hire temporary workers. It also bars businesses from taking tax deductions for wages paid to illegal workers and makes it a crime for an illegal immigrant to solicit work.

A federal judge has temporarily blocked those sections of the law so she can study them more.

Legislators said the law would help legal residents suffering from nearly 10 percent unemployment.

One of the bill's authors, Republican Sen. Scott Beason, defended the legislation by saying he expected short-term problems, and that he has received 'thank you' calls from two people who replaced illegal immigrants who fled their jobs.

'We have the best law in the country and I stand by what we've done,' Beason said.

However, on Chandler Mountain in north Alabama, tomato farmer Lana Boatwright said only eight of the 48 Hispanic workers she needed for harvest showed up after the law took effect. Those who did were frightened.

'My husband and I take them to the grocery store at night and shop for them because they are afraid they will be arrested,' she said.

Farmer Chad Smith said his family farm stands to lose up to $150,000 because there are not enough workers to pick tomatoes spoiling in the fields.

'We will be lucky to be in business next year,' he said.

The huge reduction in the workforce is set to have a damaging effect on Alabama's economy

The financial toll will vary by area, and experts said it's too early to make predictions.

In Tuscaloosa, there is still a lot of rebuilding to be done after Alabama's killer tornadoes in April.

Without the Hispanic workers to help out, it will take even longer for neighborhoods to be fixed up. Blake Corder, the president of the Home Builders Association of Tuscaloosa, noted that the workers had left the area and he even lost a few renters in the past week.

Likewise, schools are worried about their students who have suddenly stopped showing up for class. Out of 34,000 Hispanic students, 2,285 were absent Monday.

That number increased from Friday by a few hundred.

The figures show seven out of every 100 Hispanic children were out of school, even though state school officials have tried to assure parents that they won't release their names to police and that no child will be denied an education due to legal status.

Builders have complained they can't find replacement workers and delays in projects are expected.

Russell Davis, executive vice president of the Home Builders Association of Alabama, said: 'Once the economy picks up and construction returns to normal, the impact will increase.

'There is going to be a void. No question.'
