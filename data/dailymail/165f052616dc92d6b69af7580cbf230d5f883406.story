Tiger Woods has been pictured for the first time since undergoing the back surgery which put him out of the U.S. Masters for the first time in 20 years.

The 38-year-old golfer looked sombre as he sat in the passenger seat of a car driven by his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn on Wednesday, two days after his operation in Utah.

The sports star and his beau both wore sunglasses for their drive with Woods displaying several days stubble growth.

Woods said on his website on Tuesday that he had surgery Monday in Utah for a pinched nerve that had been hurting him for several months, knowing the surgery would keep him from Augusta National next week for the first time since he was in high school.

The No. 1 player in the world is a four-time Masters champion.

'After attempting to get ready for 
the Masters, and failing to make the necessary progress, I decided in 
consultation with my doctors to have this procedure done, Woods said.

'I'd
 like to express my disappointment to the Augusta National membership, 
staff, volunteers and patrons that I will not be at the Masters.

Disappointment: Tiger Woods will miss the Masters because of back surgery - his back has become increasingly troublesome and the golfing legend spoke last month at the World Golf Championships about the agony he was going through

'It's a week that's very special to me,' he said. 'It also looks like I'll be forced to miss several upcoming tournaments to focus on my rehabilitation and getting healthy.'

The Masters gets the highest television ratings of any golf tournament, and while Woods last won a green jacket in 2005, he commands most of the attention.

He won his first Masters in 1997 when he set 20 records, from youngest Masters champion (21) to his 12-shot margin of victory.

Woods has been coping with back issues since last summer — a twinge in the final round of the PGA Championship, spasms in the final round of The Barclays that caused him to fall to his knees, and then it returned with alarming regularity during the Florida swing.

He withdrew after 13 holes in the final round of the Honda Classic with what he described as lower back pain and spasms.

Agony: Tiger Woods grimaces after teeing off on the 12th hole during the final round of the Cadillac Championship golf tournament in Doral, Florida and pauses for a moment at the 17th hole on March 9

Woods shot the highest final round of his career at Doral a week later when he said his back flared up again in the final round.

He skipped the Arnold Palmer Invitational, where he was the two-time defending champion, to rest his back and do everything possible to be at Augusta National next week.

He said he had a microdiscectomy for the pinched nerve, performed by neurosurgeon Charles Rich.

A microdiscectomy is a type of minimally invasive spine surgery to relieve pressure and pain caused by a herniated disc.

Unsteady: Woods injured his Achilles after playing from under the Eisenhower tree at the 2011 Masters

Operating through a small incision in
 the lower back, surgeons remove small disc fragments that are pressing 
against spinal nerves.

Recovery
 can take several weeks and doctors typically advise against bending and
 twisting the back until patients are completely healed

'This is frustrating,' Woods said. 'But it's something my doctors advised me to do for my immediate and long-term health.'

Woods said he hopes to return to golf
 this summer, though he could not say when. It's possible he could at 
least start chipping and putting in three weeks.

His website said Woods could have sustained more damage if he had continued to play.

Carted off: Woods is driven off the course after picking up a neck injury at the Players in 2010

He will have to wait until the U.S. Open — maybe longer — to resume his quest to reach Jack Nicklaus' record 18 professional majors.

Woods won his 14th major at the 2008 U.S. Open on a badly injured left leg that required season-ending surgery two days after his playoff win at Torrey Pines.

He has not won another major since then.

Woods has 79 career wins on the PGA Tour, three short of the record held by Sam Snead.

He
 already was off to the worst start of his career. He missed a 54-hole 
cut at Torrey Pines, where he was the defending champion.

He tied for 40th in Dubai, and then withdrew from the Honda Classic and tied for 25th at Doral.

'It's tough right now, but I'm absolutely optimistic about the future,' Woods said. 'There are a couple (of) records by two outstanding individuals and players that I hope one day to break. As I've said many times, Sam and Jack reached their milestones over an entire career. I plan to have a lot of years left in mine.'

The recovery time is listed as two to
 three months before that usually happens, which would clearly leave him
 in a race against time to be ready for the meat of the summer programe.

Then there’s the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles in September.

To
 play in that, he would almost certainly need a wild card and while 
captain Tom Watson would be happy to hand him one if he has fully 
recovered, would a man who has undergone such an operation really want 
to be on a course in the heat of competition for as many as 12 hours a 
day?

1995 - Withdraws from US Open on sixth hole of his second round after injuring left wrist playing out of heavy rough

2002 - Had his second knee surgery to drain fluid around his left ACl and remove a number of cysts

2007 - Ruptured his ACL running on a golf course, however, plays through the pain for the season

2008 - Undergoes surgery on his left knee after the Masters in April

2008 - Wins US Open in June, despite being told he had two stress fractures in his left tibia

2010 - Neck problems down his right side forces him to withdraw from the Players

2010 - Reveals he had a cortisone shot to help ease 'lingering soreness' in his Achilles in December

2011 - Sustains a minor sprain to his left Achilles playing from under the Eisenhower tree at the Masters

2011 - Withdrew from the Players for the second consecutive year after Achilles, knee and calf problems

2012 - Driven off the course on the 12th hole of March's final round of the WGC at Doral after more pain in his left Achilles

2014 - Withdraws from the Honda Classic with back problems

Whatever happens, this is unquestionably another massive blow for Woods, who has been blighted by one injury after another in his thirties.

The most serious came in 2008, when he tore his anterior cruciate knee ligament and was out of action for eight months. He has also withdrawn from events owing to his achilles and a bad neck.

In 2011, he failed to tee it up at the US Open and the Open because of an Achilles complaint.

It is all a far cry from 12 months ago when he returned to the top of the world rankings with an eighth career victory at Bay Hill and third of the season.

This was supposed to be the year when Woods got back on the majors trail after a drought stretching back almost six years. Now the future looks more uncertain than ever.
