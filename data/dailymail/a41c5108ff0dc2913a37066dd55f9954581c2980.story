Justin Bieber is set to settle his Miami DUI case with a plea bargain deal that will allegedly see most of the charges against the troubled singer dropped.

The 20-year-old will reportedly plead guilty to the reckless driving charge made during his arrest in January while the rest of his charges with be dismissed according to TMZ.

Justin was originally charged with driving under the influence, resisting arrest, reckless driving and driving without a valid license when police officers claimed to have caught him and pal Khalil drag racing on Miami streets in the early hours of the morning.

New deal: Justin Bieber is set to settle his Miami DUI case with a plea bargain deal that will allegedly see most of the charges against the troubled singer dropped

While it has since been reported that the hitmaker was neither drag racing or drunk on the night, he did test positive for marijuana.

TMZ reports that the reason the plea deal has taken so long to be sorted is due to the fact the judge allegedly wanted Bieber to star in and pay for an anti-drug PSA.However, Bieber’s lawyers resisted because they felt that the idea was inappropriate.

The singer’s camp also felt it was unnecessary for the star with attend a drug and alcohol education curse because he does not have a substance abuse problem and attending classes would indicate that he does.

A source told the site: ‘Bieber will plead guilty to reckless driving and the other charges will be dismissed.  He'll pay a fine and attend anger management classes.  He will NOT be placed on probation. 

Meanwhile, his rapper friend Khalil will use the same plea but will not have to attend any classes.Once Bieber and Khalil complete the requirements of the settlement, the reckless driving conviction will then be wiped from their record.

The deal is expected to be entered in court in coming weeks.

In trouble with the law again: The 20-year-old - seen in LA in May -  was under investigation for attempted robbery

The news comes after the singer's robbery case was rejected by the Los Angeles District Attorney.

Justin
 was hit by claims earlier this month that he had allegedly stolen a 
woman's phone in Sherman Oaks, California, after she photographed him.

But
 the prosecutor's office has rejected the case after Los Angeles Police 
found no evidence to support the woman's allegations, TMZ reports.

Police
 interviewed nine eyewitnesses at the scene of the alleged crime, 
Sherman Oaks Castle Park, and not a single one could confirm the woman's
 claims.

The District Attorney rejected the case, however they did send it to the City Attorney, which could result in a misdemeanor.

Earlier this month The LA Times spoke to Officer Rosario Herrera of the Los Angeles Police Department, who confirmed: 'He has been accused of attempted robbery.'

The pop singer, who wore jeans, a black T-shirt and a maroon coloured beanie, was alleged to have 'wrestled' with the mother to try and obtain her cell phone, to stop her from taking pictures, and eventually 'ripped' it from her hands. She was with her 13-year-old daughter at the time.

Before the drama: On Monday, Justin posted this Instagram video of himself enjoying the miniature golf course

TMZ reported that the woman claimed 
Justin was unable to delete the pictures when he finally got hold of the
 phone, as it was locked.

Meanwhile,
 Justin is currently scheduled to go on trial for charges of driving 
under the influence in Florida following his arrest in January.

He is also expected to have a hearing regarding his now infamous egg throwing incident in California.
