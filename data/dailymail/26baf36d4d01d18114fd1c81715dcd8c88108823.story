The man who reportedly shot dead at least 85 people at a youth camp and killed another seven with a car bomb in the Norwegian capital of Oslo, released a YouTube video calling for conservatives to 'embrace martyrdom' six hours before the attacks, it has emerged.

Anders Behring Breivik posted the video promoting a fight against Islam, which shows pictures of him wearing a wetsuit and pointing an automatic weapon, hours before he set out on the devastating killing spree.

In a text with the video he detailed his plans for the attacks, writing that he would 'dress up as a police officer', adding that it would 'be awesome as people will be astonished'.

Attacks: Breivik set out how to make bombs from fertilisers and how to receive them in large quantities by setting up an agricultural company

In the disturbing 1,500-page dossier, he wrote that 'there are situations where cruelty is necessary' and that it is better to kill too many than not enough'.

Police sources told Norwegian media that
 Breivik had confessed to posting the video setting out his extremist 
views before the attacks.

Breivik was a member of the Masonic lodge in Oslo and had links to the English Defence League.

In one post online, he wrote: 'I have on some occasions discussed with... the EDL and recommended them to use conscious strategies.

'The tactics of the EDL is to ''entice'' an overreaction from jihad youth/extreme Marxists, something they have succeeded [in] several times already.'

Police chief Roger Andersen said: 'What we know is that he is right wing and a Christian 
fundamentalist.'

The 12-minute video, called 'Knights Templar 2083', also reportedly appeared on Breivik's now-closed Facebook page.

The page cites philosophers like Machiavelli, Immanuel Kant and John Stuart Mill.

He listed Kafka among his favourite authors and George Orwell's 1984 as one of his favourite books.

In the accompanying document, which he set out as a manifesto for 'conservative revolution', he described how to make bombs from fertilisers and how to receive them in large quantities by setting up an agricultural company.

In May, he had six tonnes of fertiliser delivered to the remote farm he owned, 80 miles north of Oslo.

The manifesto describes his experiments with explosives and his first successful test detonation of a bomb in a 
remote location on June 13.

The account of bomb-making is also dotted with details about what he watched on TV including the Eurovision song contest and American police drama The Shield.

The author said that he had sent the text and YouTube video in which he attacked multiculturalism and Muslim immigration to his '7,000 patriotic Facebook friends'.

In the text, titled 'A European Declaration of Independence', he wrote how he wanted to rid Europe of Islam and Marxism.

'There are situations in which 
cruelty is necessary, and refusing to apply necessary cruelty is a 
betrayal of the people whom you wish to protect,' he wrote.

'The preferred method is to attack in a violent and deceptive form (shock attack).

Plan of attack: The manifesto includes detail plans of the horrific killings

Final words: Breivik signed off the document hours before the bomb went off in Oslo

Cruelty is necessary: Breivik wrote that it is better to 'kill too many than not enough, or you risk reducing the desired ideological impact of the strike'

Poses: Breivik wore military style uniforms in photos included in the 12-minute YouTube video

'It is better to kill too many than not enough, or you risk reducing the desired ideological impact of the strike,' he added.

'Do not apologise, make excuses or express regret for you are acting in self-defence or in a preemptive manner.'

Writing under the name Andrew 
Berwick, an anglicised version of his name, the suspect said that it had
 taken him nine years and cost 300,000 euros to write the manifesto.

He said: 'The first drop of rain 
marks the coming of a great and unstoppable cultural conservative tidal 
wave. The tidal wave will cleanse Western Europe of cultural Marxism and
 will result in the banishment of Islam for the third time.

'The
 European tree of liberty will be refreshed by the blood of our patriots
 and of the Marxist tyrrants. This civil war will last several decades 
but we will succeed.

'Never
 forget that we fight so that you and your children can remain free. For
 a future Europe safe from the tyrany of cultural-Marxism and of Islam. A
 Europe worth dying for.'

Breivik
 said that he wanted to see Europe more similar to countries such as 
Japan and South Korea, which he said are 'not far from cultural 
conservatism and nationalism at its best'.

He declared: 'Celebrate us, the martyrs of the conservative revolution, for we will soon dine in the Kingdom of Heaven.'

Last
 night the YouTube video posted under the name 'AndrewBerwick' was taken
 down from the site because 'its content violated YouTube's terms of 
service'.

Breivik kept a daily diary in the months leading up to the attacks, filled with detailed plans.

He predicted that his actions would 
kill or injure more than a million people, saying: 'The time for 
dialogue is over. We gave peace a chance. The time for armed resistance 
has come.'

Profile: Breivik wrote that he his hobbies included Free Masonry, political analysis and travelling

Tolerant: Breivik wrote that he is not a racist and has never been

Instructions: Breivik wrote that it was sometimes necessary to wear make up to look your best

The document also described a secret meeting in London in April 2002 to reconstitute the Knights Templar - skilled fighters endorsed by the Church who fought during the Crusades in the Middle Ages. They are sometimes revered by white supremacists. 

It said the meeting was attended by nine representatives of eight European countries with another three members unable to attend, including a 'European-American'.

The document does not name the attendees or say whether they were aware of Breivik’s planned attacks. It is thought that investigators will now try to determine if these people exist and what their connection is to Breivik.

Thomas Hegghammer, a terrorism expert at the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, said the manifesto bears a resemblance to those of Osama bin Laden although from a Christian standpoint.

Mr Hegghammer told the New York Times: 'It seems to be an attempt to mirror Al Qaeda, exactly in reverse.'

Police said that unexploded bombs had been located in some other buildings in Oslo and they had not ruled out the possibility that Breivik had accomplices.Police refuse to speculate on motives for the attack but the bomb in Oslo targeted buildings connected to Norway's governing Labour Party, and the youth camp on Utoeya island was also run by the party.

Police chief Sveinung Sponheim said: 'He has had a dialogue with the police the whole time, but he is a very demanding suspect.'

Officials say Breivik has said he acted alone and admits the attack but denies he has broken the law.

He had previously been a youth member of the right-wing Progress Party between 1999 and 2004, which has been vocal in its anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim view points.

Joran Kallmyr, a party member who is now Oslo’s vice mayor for transportation, said he met Breivik several times in 2002 and 2003 at meetings.

Mr Kallmyr said: 'He was very quiet, almost a little bit shy. But he was a normal person with good behavior. He never shared any extreme thoughts or speech with us. There was absolutely no reason to expect that he could do something like this. We’re very shocked.'

Breivik reportedly left the party in 2006 as he was disappointed as it moved towards the centre.

His Internet posts also indicated contempt for the Conservative Party, which he accused of having given up the battle against multiculturalism.

Despite the hatred displayed in his blogs, it is unlikely that authorities would have noticed Breivik. He did not belong to any violent neo-Nazi groups.

A friend told the Norwegian newspaper VG that Breivik had been aligned to the far right since his late twenties when he began posting opinions online, including the site Document.no.

According to a fellow user of the anti-Islamic site, Breivik began posting there in 2009 and over the course of just two months wrote 75 pieces.

He has written about Somali immigrants with 'full Norwegian passports sitting at home on benefits'.

Members of the website and his Masonic lodge were also approached Breivik who he wanted to help him start up an ultra-conservative newspaper.

Breivik was raised in Oslo and is alleged to have attended the same primary school as Norway's crown prince.

A defining moment perhaps was choosing to be baptised into the Protestant church at the age of 15. However more recently, he wrote of his disgust at 'priests in jeans who march for Palestine and churches that look like minimalist shopping centres'.

He was a fan of violent video games including World of Warcraft and Call of Duty and regularly wore 'military-style' clothing.

Although having a degree and attending business school, his businesses ventures mostly failed until he set up his farm two years ago.

In one blog posting, he says that the only purpose of having a successful business was to fund his political agenda.
