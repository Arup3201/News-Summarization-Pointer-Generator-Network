You're probably feeling pretty smug as you suck down on your cucumber and amaranth smoothie while reading this, mid-way through your carb-free January juice fast.

But be warned: one in six New Year dieters will actually gain weight this month.

And if it's not a basic lack of human willpower that trips you up and elbows you face-first into the biscuit tin, it'll either be the fact that January is too boring to focus on a diet, or the reality that you're hungry and constantly thinking about food.

You're probably feeling pretty smug as you suck down on your cucumber and amaranth smoothie while reading this, mid-way through your carb-free January juice fast, but one in six New Year dieters will actually gain weight

Many people looking to 
cut back on food intake and lose their Christmas bulge find 
themselves struggling to such an extent that 17 per cent of dieters actually gain weight in January.

Some 31 per cent of people polled as part of a survey by Voucher Cloud admitted dieting in January, while 28 per cent say they cut down on food and 41 per cent change nothing about their eating habits.

Of the 1,915 British men and women surveyed, 62 per cent said they had previously dieted in January, with 54 per cent saying their New Year weight-loss plan had been a success.

But 29 per cent said they remained the same weight, and 17 per cent - one in six - actually gained weight in the first month of the year.

Respondents
 who had gained weight were asked why they felt this happened, to which 
just over a quarter, 27 per cent, said that trying to avoid food 
actually made them feel hungrier as they 'thought about it all the 
time'.

January is considered too boring a month in which to diet, which leads to people failing

Some 25 per cent found themselves 'comfort eating to avoid the January
 blues', while 22 per cent said that January was 'too boring' so they 
'lacked the motivation' to stick to a diet plan.

The biggest response, 
however, was simply down to a 'lack of willpower', with 48 per cent 
admitting to having just given up.

Those
 who lost weight were asked to state in pounds the amount of weight that
 they'd lost following their January diet, which revealed the average 
figure to be 6.1lb across all dieters.

Those who said they had 
gained weight during this period in the past were also asked how much 
they had put on, which revealed the average to be 2.4lb.

When
 successful January dieters were asked if they believed they had 
achieved their target weight loss in the past, only 32 per cent of 
dieters said yes.

But 44 per cent said that they would have preferred to have lost more, while 24 per cent said that they were far off what they would like to have lost.

The
 reasons behind wanting to lose weight were also looked at in the study,
 which revealed the main reason to simply be to look good, with 56 per
 cent of respondents selecting that as their biggest motivator.

Around 33 per 
cent said it was to improve general health, while 11 per cent said
 it was down to 'pressure from their partner'.

The
 financial side of dieting was also explored by the study, as all 
respondents who had attempted a January diet in the past were asked if they had ever paid money to sign up to specific diets.

To this, 43 per
 cent of dieters said they had, but only 48 per cent of these believed their money had been well-spent.

Matthew Wood of Voucher Cloud said: 'January is by far the most common time of year for people to look at cutting down and getting in shape. When the bells are ringing out for New Year's Day it's easy to think that it will be a breeze to lose the spare tyre gained over Christmas. However, this often isn't the case!

'Many of us have a clear social calendar during this period, which might make it appear easier to cut down on unnecessary calories.

'Yet one of the biggest causes of over eating is simple boredom and it seems that there's plenty of that in January. It's far too easy to help yourself to junk food out of the cupboard when having a quiet Saturday night in!

'Dieting can also be beneficial for your finances, however, as cutting back on luxuries and alcohol can often help you save the pennies. Your wallet may just thank you for sticking to that diet.'
