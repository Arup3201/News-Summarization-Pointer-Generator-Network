They say you’re only as old as you feel. Now scientists have discovered the adage might actually be true.

A study showed those who feel younger than they really are have a better life expectancy.

Those who felt their age were more likely to die young – and people who felt older were at the greatest risk.

Scientists have found that the younger people feel the longer they live - and maintaining a healthy weight helped increase life expectancy

Psychologists say self-perceived age is a quick and easy way to predict longevity.

They claim that feeling younger than your actual age could be a combination of healthy lifestyle factors and a greater ‘will to live’.

The research involved 6,500 older adults taking part in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, who were asked to assess how old they felt and their death rates were analysed.

The study led by University College London (UCL) scientists follows previous research which linked happiness and having a sense of purpose in life with a lower risk of death.

Co-author Andrew Steptoe, British Heart Foundation Professor of Psychology, said many older people feel younger than their actual age.

He said ‘People’s judgements about how old they feel are likely influenced by a number of factors – aches and pains, serious illness, feelings of vitality, what sorts of social and physical activity we do, and so on.

Researchers asked 6,500 older people how old they felt then studied their health over an eight-year period

‘What is interesting in this study is that when we took people’s health state, mobility and functioning into account, we still found an association between feeling older than one’s real age and greater mortality over the next eight years.

‘So some other factors seem to be contributing to the association between how old you feel and survival.

‘I don’t think that people should worry about this. But it’s certainly something that I as a medical researcher should try and understand.

‘The fact that such a quick and simple measure predicts longevity makes it worth pursuing. Perhaps these feelings tell us something that other measures of health and wellbeing do not capture.’

Of those who felt younger, 14 per cent had died in eight-year period compared to 25 per cent who said they felt older

The study participants had an average chronological age of 65.8 years but their average self-perceived age was 56.8 years.

Almost 70 per cent felt three or more years younger than their actual age, while a quarter had a self-perceived age close to their real age.

Around one in 20 felt more than a year older than their chronological age, says a report in JAMA Internal Medicine.

Death rates over a follow-up period of eight years were 14.3 per cent in adults who felt younger and 18.5 percent in those who felt about their actual age.

The rate reached its highest level of almost 25 per cent in those adults who felt older than they really were, according to the study results.

The relationship between self-perceived age and cardiovascular death was strong but there was no link between self-perceived age and cancer death.

The report said maintaining a healthy weight and following medical advice were typical of the healthy living behaviours that were measured.

But, it said, other factors might be influential such as ‘greater resilience, sense of mastery and will to live’ among those who feel younger than their age.

‘Self-perceived age has the potential to change, so interventions may be possible.

‘Individuals who feel older than their actual age could be targeted with health messages promoting positive health behaviours and attitudes toward aging’ the study concludes.

The study comes after the Government has made a priority of improving national wellbeing through a series of measures at work and in the community.
