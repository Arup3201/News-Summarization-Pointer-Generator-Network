In a football world dominated by men, one woman has been quietly working in the lower leagues of Italy for a number of years.

Elena Pianigiani, has been the vice-president of Italian fourth division side US Poggibonsi since the age of 21.

Having struggled between the Italian fourth and fifth tier for much of their existence, Poggibonsi, in Tuscany, saw former Siena director Antonello Pianigiani purchase 51 per cent of the club in 2008.

Buying the remaining 49 per cent two years later, Pianigiani soon appointed his daughter as the club's vice-president.

Speaking to Bleacher Report, Pianigiani revealed she didn't hesitate in accepting the position and said: 'In 2010 when my father asked me to join Poggibonsi, I didn’t think twice.

'It was unusual because I was only 21. When you’re that age, it’s usual for a father to give his daughter a new bag, not a football team.'

Strictly speaking, Pianigiani's role at the club isn't her first in football.

'My passion began as a 10-year-old when my Dad was involved at our home-town club Siena,' she said. 'We were promoted to Serie B and I remember the fantastic atmosphere around the city; I became the team’s mascot!

While Poggibonsi's vice-president admits football is dominated by males, she is encouraged by the progress women are making in the game and said:'Calcio is very macho, but something is certainly changing with more women appearing, though I believe purely technical aspects are suitable for only men. I do think women are essential, however, companies are companies and it’s always good to have a woman, as we can make cold decisions when the case requires it.'

However, Pianigiani isn't the only female making her way in the game.

Both Rosella Sensi of Roma and Barbara Berlusconi of AC Milan, are two women who hold positions of authority within the Italian top-flight.

As well, back in May, Helena Costa became football's first female coach when put in charge of French second division side Clermont Foot.

While Costa ended up leaving the club just a month later without giving a reason for her departure, Pianigiani was pleased with Clermont's decision to appoint a female manager and said: 'It was a brave choice. I send big "Good Luck!" to the coach. She is a great woman to manage a dressing room. They have gained a new supporter!'

A huge football fan, Pianigiani echoes the thoughts of many match-going supporters when she says: 'You're tense and anxious before and during the game, and your mood depends on the outcome. If you win, you're elated and start the working week on the right foot. But if you lose, you want to go straight to bed!'

Hoping to guide Poggibonsi up the divisions, Pianigiani will be keen for many good starts to the week this season.
