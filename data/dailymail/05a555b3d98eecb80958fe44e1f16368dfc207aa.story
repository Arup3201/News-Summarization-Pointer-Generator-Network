One Direction can't seem to make up their mind as to which team they like the most in Spain after Louis Tomlinson and Niall Horan paid a visit to the Nou Camp in Barcelona kits.

The superstars, who donned Real Madrid kits when they visited Cristiano Ronaldo last year, got to go one step further than those who get the regular tour of the Barca den.

The duo took to the same pitch that regularly sees Lionel Messi work his magic to pose and have a kickabout on the La Liga giant's immaculate pitch.

Horan 
said: 'I have been here a few times before, and it’s nice to be back. 
This is one of the best stadiums in the world, and it was incredible to 
get the chance to walk out on to the pitch.'

Tomlinson is no stranger to the football scene, after completing his takeover of League One club Doncaster Rovers in June.

The 22-year-old, a lifelong fan of the club, joined forces with the club's former chairman John Ryan. His spokesman confirmed: 'It's done, the takeover is complete.'
