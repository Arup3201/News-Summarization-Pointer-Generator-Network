Liverpool and Ivory Coast defender Kolo Toure has announced his international retirement after 15 years in the Elephants set up.

The 33-year-old has played in three World Cups and seven Africa Cup of Nations tournaments since he burst onto the international scene in 2000.

After two successive AFCON finals defeats Kolo finally got his rewards just weeks ago when he lifted the 2015 edition of the trophy following victory over Ghana.

Kolo said in an interview with Côte D’ivoirian media, “It is with great emotion that I inform you that it is time to say goodbye.”

“My goal was to win the Africa Cup of Nations and I must admit that it was a very difficult decision to make. I do love my country and especially love football, but at some point, there comes a time to stop.”

The Elephants could also lose manager Herve Renard who has a buyout clause in his contract and is taking the interests of Egypt.
