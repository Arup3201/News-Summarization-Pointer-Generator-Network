A mother who battered her toddler son to death has been allowed prison visits from his twin sister and her three other children, it emerged yesterday.

Rosdeep Adekoya beat three-year-old Mikaeel Kular for being sick and left him to die in agony for three days before hiding his body in a suitcase and dumping it in woods.

She then told police the boy had wandered off, sparking a huge manhunt before she eventually led officers to the body near Kirkcaldy in Fife.

The 34-year-old avoided a murder trial and the possibility of a life sentence of up to 35 years after a court accepted her guilty plea to the lesser charge of culpable homicide.

Adekoya was visited by Mikaeel’s twin sister on what would have been his fourth birthday. She is also allowed access to her other three children aged ten, eight and six, every fortnight in the visitor centre of Cornton Vale women’s prison in Stirling, central Scotland. Last night campaigners branded the visits ‘disgusting’.

The party-mad single mother – who had frequently left her children home alone to go to nightclubs and take cocaine – was jailed for 11 years last month and could be free within seven. Five thousand local residents have signed a petition protesting against the failure of prosecutors to pursue a murder charge against her.

Last night a former neighbour to Adekoya, Julie MacLeod, who started the petition, told the Daily Mail: ‘The fact she is now seeing her other children is disgusting.

‘She killed one of them and when she did that she should have lost her right to see the others.

‘She doesn’t deserve to have them and she could be a danger to them. Why should she have that privilege when she has robbed them of their brother?’

Psychologist Gladeana McMahon told the Sunday People: ‘You have to think about the psychological trauma of a child having to visit a parent in prison and then come away.’

During the court case it emerged that Adekoya had failed to form a motherly bond with Mikaeel. Her internet search history in the weeks before his death included phrases such as: ‘I find it hard to love my son’, ‘I love all of my children except one’, ‘Why am I so aggressive with my son’ and ‘get rid of bruises’.

Mikaeel’s father Zahid Saeed, a 30-year-old chef, said he believed Adekoya beat their son to death because ‘he was a miniature version of me’.

He told the Sunday People: ‘She saw it as killing my legacy. Her obsession made her love me and hate me too. She would stop at nothing to hurt me for rejecting her.’

Social services were widely criticised for failing Mikaeel after it emerged he was twice taken into care by social workers.

An independent significant case review is going to be held.
