Alan Irvine has revealed Leonardo Ulloa was on his West Brom wishlist as he prepares to try to silence the striker.

The head coach admits he was tracking the Argentinian before he made an £8million summer move from Brighton to Leicester.

Irvine instead signed Brown Ideye for a club record £10million from Dynamo Kiev but the Nigeria international has struggled for form and fitness.

West Brom head coach Alan Irvine revealed that the Baggies wanted to sign the tall front man

He has just one goal - in the Capital One Cup - compared to Ulloa's five in the Barclays Premier League.

The Baggies face Ulloa and Leicester at the King Power Stadium on Saturday and Irvine has revealed he was interested in bringing him to the Hawthorns.

He said: 'He was a player that was on a great big list in the recruitment room. Mervyn Day, who is our head scout, was at Brighton so he knows him really well.

'We talked about him and looked at him and made enquiries about him but we didn't make an offer.

'He was a player who was definitely being considered but Leicester jumped in very quickly. Time will tell who ends up being the best buy.

'From our point of view we hope Brown ends up being a great signing for us.

'Whether Ulloa turns out to be one for Leicester I'm not really too interested in - it's ours that are my focus.

'You just want them to do a great job for us and if they do that we will be delighted - then it is okay for someone else's players to do well for them too.'

Ideye is fit after an ankle problem and played in Albion's 2-1 Capital One Cup defeat to Bournemouth on Tuesday.

West Brom instead opted to sign Ideye Brown (centre) for a club record fee but he has struggled with injuries 

And Irvine hopes the 26-year-old can finally kickstart his Baggies career.

'It was good for him to get a start. He needed that and hopefully it will do him a lot of good,' he said.

'It's been frustrating for him and the same for us.

'Having scored his first goal he got injured scoring it and that was a real shame as everyone has seen plenty of times in the past a striker scores a goal and suddenly he can't stop scoring.'

Saido Berahino's eight goals have grabbed the headlines and eased the pressure on Ideye and Irvine feels Berahino's form has allowed Ideye to develop away from the spotlight.

'Yes, absolutely it has given him that little bit more time to get fit, first of all,' he said.

'It's given him the opportunity as well to get to know people and get more settled in the area.

'I hate to think how I would have managed going to Ukraine. It can't be easy. And for a Nigerian to come from Ukraine to England it is a big life change.'
