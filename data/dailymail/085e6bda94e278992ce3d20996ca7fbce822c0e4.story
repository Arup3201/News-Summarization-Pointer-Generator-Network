NHS hospitals are demanding an end to national pay bargaining agreements so they can pay staff to reflect the local cost of living.

The Foundation Trust Network – which represents more than 200 trusts across England – said introducing new ways of negotiating pay would allow money to be diverted to patient care.

The organisation’s chief executive, Chris Hopson, said it was time to consider setting pay regionally or trust-by-trust, as national agreements would not deliver the necessary cutbacks.

Change: The Foundation Trust Network - which represents more than 200 trusts across England - said introducing new ways of negotiating pay would allow money to be diverted to patient care

A new deal on pay, terms and conditions for most NHS staff in England is due to be announced soon. One of its main changes is a clearer link between pay rises and performance.

Mr Hopson said NHS trusts completely supported the deal on the table. However, he argued that the challenges of the next five years – a flat budget, rising costs, and the need to improve care at nights and weekends – mean more savings will be required.

He explained that pay takes up between 60 and 70 per cent of an average trust’s costs, but safety concerns mean it is impossible to cut staff numbers in the same way as other public services.

Mr Hopson said he estimated the current deal would secure an average hospital annual savings of about £250,000, out of the £11million needed, which some people might call ‘a drop in the ocean’.

He added: ‘Trusts now have a pressing need for the NHS to start discussing the different ways we could set pay, terms and conditions including looking at whether we should set pay nationally, regionally or trust by trust – exactly the same debate as the education service is now having.

‘Can the NHS, for example, continue to afford a system that gives 60 per cent of staff a 2 per cent pay increase every year, irrespective of performance, on top of any cost-of living-increase?’

Unfair: Chancellor George Osborne believes it is unfair that people earn just as money in areas where the cost of living is low than those in more expensive parts of the country

So far there are moves towards allowing schools to set their own wage rates, but no progress has been made in health.

The unions – supported by both Labour and the Liberal Democrats – are vociferously opposed to proposed changes to the national pay bargaining system.

At the moment, public sector pay review bodies negotiate with the unions to agree on a flat-rate pay deal for the entire country.

The Tories would like to allow the pay review bodies to put forward regional pay deals to reflect the cost of living in different parts of the country. Chancellor George Osborne believes it is unfair that people earn just as money in areas where the cost of living is low than those in more expensive parts of the country.

And he says many private businesses cannot compete with high public sector wages – meaning they stop creating jobs in depressed areas of the country.

Janet Davies, from the Royal College of Nursing, said: 'Our experience shows that the cost of moving to individual negotiation can outweigh any potential benefit'

The Chancellor would like to see public sector workers in the South East earning more than those in the North, where housing is cheaper.

A consortium of trusts are already trying to establish their own system of wage negotiations. They want to be able to set their own pay levels to reflect the higher cost of living in the South East.

Health minister Dr Dan Poulter said he thought the proposed changes to NHS employee contracts were long overdue.

He said: ‘Patient care lies at the heart of this. This is why discussions have been about making a much stronger link between providing high-quality patient care and annual pay progression with a much stronger emphasis on behaviours referenced in the NHS Constitution around compassion, dignity and respect.’

Janet Davies, from the Royal College of Nursing, said abandoning the national pay negotiations would not resolve the severe financial pressures the NHS now faces.

She said: ‘Our experience shows that the cost of moving to individual negotiation can outweigh any potential benefit.

‘Nor will the NHS be able to raise the standard of care by moving to a system of pay cartels.

‘The present Agenda for Change system is a transparent and fair system that allows employers to plan ahead with certainty and to reward experience.’

Christina McAnea, from the public service union Unison, warned the proposed system could even undermine the new pay deal.

She said: ‘If the Foundation Trust Network is saying the current proposals are not enough it puts the whole thing at risk.’
