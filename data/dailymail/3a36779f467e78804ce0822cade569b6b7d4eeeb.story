First, runner Zeddie Little charmed the world with his infectious smile and classic good looks. 

Then, there was the ridiculously photogenic puppy, a galloping lop-eared creature frolicking through a meadow that became an instant internet sensation.

But now there's David Seerveld, an exterminator working out of Orlando, Florida, who also happens to know how to work his angles.

On his website, AA Animal Control, which
operates out of Orlando, Florida, Mr Seerveld posted dozens of pictures
of himself in action – with every kind of critter that central Florida 
could produce.

Mr Seerveld spoke with MailOnline about the honour of being named BuzzFeed’s ‘sexiest exterminator.

‘I wouldn’t say it’s necessarily accurate,’ he said, laughing, ‘but I’ll take what I can get.’

His business, he explained, is all about handling wildlife humanely, he explained, and not so much about exterminating pests. ‘It’s me and two guys in Orlando, both better looking than me,’ he said.

Among the dangerous things he’s caught are alligators, rattlesnakes, armadillos and other more common creatures like raccoons, bats, and rats.

Double trouble: Here, he poses with two young raccoons, flashing a toothy smile

Going batty: It is clear that the wildlife lover does not fear any of the animals with which he deals

He explained: ‘The only animals that are killed are rats. They’re good animals, they’re intelligent, I don’t want to kill any rats, but there’s no other practical way to (get rid of them).’

The rest of the animals are taken out to the wild and re-released.

‘The worst thing you can do is poison rats. That would cause them to suffer needlessly. The most important thing is to seal up the home to make sure the rats can’t get inside.’

Other
photographs show that the trapper is anything but squeamish. One image 
shows him holding a pair of dead rats trapped in Victor mousetraps.

The
images were spotted by BuzzFeed’s Katie Notopoulos, who said she might 
have been in need of someone to take care of a pest problem.

Smoldering: David posts pictures on AA Animal Control's website showing off the critters he catches

Mr Seerveld said that the photos ended up on his website in part because he was training so many other people, and partially because he wanted to provide information for those dealing with the local fauna.

The nuisance wildlife operator offered some professional advice, as well.

A word to the wise? ‘Never try to handle wildlife – leave it alone, particularly snakes.  If anyone does have a wildlife problem, hire the right person, and no one who uses poison, because it’s inhumane and doesn’t solve the problem.’

He said he married a wonderful woman this January. His wife, he said, loves baby raccoons 'the best.'

He added: 'Baby raccoons are way cuter than me of course.  They're even cuter than my wife, but I won't tell her that.'

Ridiculously photogenic: This picture of Zeddie Little, pictured in the maroon shirt, became an instant internet meme

Canine companion: This picture of a loping puppy was the next meme in line - the pooch was dubbed the most 'ridiculously photogenic dog'
