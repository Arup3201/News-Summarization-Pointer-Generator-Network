A pregnant horse died in agony from a gaping neck wound after its cruel owner made it wear a poorly repaired bridle which cut down to the bone.

The three-year-old horse named Princess was spotted by walkers in Bradford, West Yorkshire, and was in such a bad state that that they could smell the animal’s rotting flesh.

Paul Pratt, 29, the animal’s owner, was taken to court and has now been banned from keeping animals for life after admitting a charge of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal.

Princess suffered such serious neglect that she died in agony from a gaping neck wound caused by her bridle

Despite treatment Princess died just days later from septicaemia and vets were unable to save her unborn foal

Photographs taken of Princess after she was found show that the bridle was digging in to her flesh so deeply that it had penetrated down to the jaw bone.

The RSPCA said it is likely the wound had been untreated for two weeks and the pregnant horse was starving to death when she was found because she could not eat.

Despite treatment she died just days later from septicaemia and vets were unable to save her unborn foal.

Pratt, from Bradford, who also owned two other horses, one of which he had had for 14 years, was given a 12 weeks prison sentence suspended for two years when he appeared at Bradford Magistrates Court.

Paul Pratt, 29, appeared before Bradford Magistrates Court where he admitted a charge of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal

He was also fined £1,000 and ordered to pay an £80 victim surcharge on top of the life-long ban.

Nigel Monaghan, prosecuting, said: ‘An inspection was carried out following a member of public notifying the RSPCA of the situation. By that point the collar had been cut off.

‘It had been digging in and smelt foul. Flesh was hanging down around the twine and there appeared to be the jaw bone underneath. The inspector felt the smell of rotting would have been obvious to anyone.’

The horse was kept in a vulnerable state in fields off a residential road in Bradford between January 21 and February 6 this year, the court heard.

In addition to a gaping wound to the length of her jaw bone, Princess was lying on her stomach, caked in mud.

Mr Monaghan said: ‘She was sweating and struggling to breathe and drink water. The vet was concerned the horse was unable to move her jaw and she was given a tetanus injection but unfortunately the horse died.

‘We believe she was unable to feed because of the collar. This would have been prevented or reduced in severity if the owner had removed the head collar and had her treated.’

A post-mortem was carried and revealed that the lesion had been there for at least two weeks - if not longer- and there was no evidence of an attempt to treat the wounds.

As a result Princess developed septicaemia and the post mortem also revealed she had a fatty liver- a symptom of starvation.

The court accepted that this was not a case of deliberate torture, Mr Monaghan said: ‘The strap at some point broke and was replaced simply by a piece of twine. The defendant says that he did not put the twine under the head collar.

‘The charge is not did he put the collar there but that he caused the unnecessary suffering of an animal. He had a responsibility to check on the horse regularly and if the animal requires veterinary attention he should seek it.

‘Owners have a responsibility to their animals. The fact that this horse was in foal means that this led to the death of two animals.’

Mr Pratt had two other horses in the field with Princess - one aged 14 who he had owned since birth, and although they were found in good physical condition, they were taken from his care following her death.

In a statement read out at court Pratt said he had owned horses for years and checked on them every morning and every evening and added that he checked ‘they had four legs and a head’.

He said he had checked on Princess on the morning she was found and although he saw she had the head collar on and that it was not in good working condition he only noticed what he called a ‘mark under her chin’.

Ian Hudson, defending, said: ‘As we have heard from the inspector, the horse was in good bodily condition, despite its other wounds and that is what Mr Pratt saw when he saw the horse everyday.

‘To look at the horse, it did not seem to be suffering and he accepts his culpability.’

Pratt had a previous RSPCA conviction in 2007 when he was charged with keeping two dozen chickens and bantams in the back of a dirty trailer without food, adequate water or sunlight. Three of the animals died because of the poor conditions.

Magistrates chairman Graham Laycock, said: ‘The offence you have committed is so serious to put it in the custody threshold. I however have decided to deal with you by way of a suspended sentence.

You will have a lifetime ban on any animals, which means keeping, owning or dealing in any animals.‘In reaching this decision we have considered the animals suffering and neglect and the offence so serious to result in its death.’
