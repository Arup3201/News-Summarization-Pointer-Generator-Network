A 63-year-old man was charged on Thursday in connection with the murder of his ex-wife, 20 years his junior.

Robert Moses was taken into custody  after mother-of-one Anna Moses, 43, was found dead in her Frisco, Texas home on January 14.

During an interview with NBC 5, two days after he allegedly killed his ex-wife, Moses said he and the University of Texas employee had been divorced for two years but maintained a 'strong relationship'.

Arrested: Robert Moses, 63, (mugshot right) was taken into custody after divorced mother-of-one Anna Moses, 43, was found dead in her Frisco, Texas, home on January 14. He told a TV station they had been divorced for two years but maintained they had a 'strong relationship' 

Investigators discovered her blood inside a blue Hyundai Sonata that was stolen from outside her home when she was slayed.

Police located the car blocks away and, according to the Dallas Morning News, found links to the suspect's blood inside. 

Moses, who has a 20-year-old son with his ex-wife, Igor, was interviewed by detectives on January 15 who found a fresh cut on his right hand.

He voluntarily submitted a fingerprint and tests revealed traces in the car were a positive match. 

Mrs Moses had worked at the University of Texas, Dallas, since 2005. 

Her colleagues at the school, where Moses worked as the assistant director of strategic planning and analysis at the college, requested police to carry out the welfare check on the home when she failed to show up for work.

Devastating: Mrs Moses' body was discovered after she failed to turn up for work at the University of Texas. Her concerned colleagues then asked police to do a welfare check on her home 

Authorities then discovered her body and the car missing from her driveway. 

At the time of her death, university spokesman John Walls said: 'The news of Anna's passing is a shock to the University community. She will be sorely missed.' 

Police transported Robert Moses to the Frisco Police Detention Center and charged him with murder. His bond was set at $1 million. 

At the time of her death, a family friend said Moses recently had been seeing another man, but it's unknown whether investigators had spoken to him. 

Friend Donna Ross called Moses a 'very kind, very loving, very caring, very intelligent person'.

'I can't imagine anyone wanting to harm her in any way,' she said.

Russian-born Moses divorced husband Bob Moses about two years ago but they remained friendly and continued to bring up their 20-year-old son, Igor, together. 

Probe: Moses  told the TV station he and 20-year-old son Igor (pictured) were co-operating with the investigation

Scene: Investigators arrived at her home in Frisco, Texas, last month and found her car had been stolen from the drive. It was rediscovered in the neighborhood and is believed to have traces of Moses' DNA inside
