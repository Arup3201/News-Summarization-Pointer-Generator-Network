A superbike fan was pulled over by police after performing high-speed wheelie stunts on one of Britain’s most famous roads.

The unidentified man was filmed by a passer-by riding a Yamaha R1 worth around £12,000 on Sloane Street in Knightsbridge, central London, on Saturday evening.

Revving the bike’s powerful engine and skidding on the tarmac in busy traffic, he was clearly having fun - but this was soon cut short when police officers arrived to put a stop to his antics.
