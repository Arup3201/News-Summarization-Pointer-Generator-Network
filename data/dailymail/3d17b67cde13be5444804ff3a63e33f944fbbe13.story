Kent have announced 2005 Ashes winner Geraint Jones will leave the club at the end of the season once his deal expires.

The wicketkeeper-batsman, who played a full part in England's historic victory over Australia nine years ago, has been kept out of the side this season by Sam Billings.

He spent part of this campaign on loan with Gloucestershire as a replacement for the injured Gareth Roderick, but has spent most of the year in Kent's second XI team.

And the county have now decided that the 38-year-old is surplus to requirements and will not be offered a new contract.

Kent president and chairman of cricket Graham Johnson said 'Decisions such as these are never easy and Geraint has been dignified in his approach to his contract position and extremely supportive of the squad during the 2014 season.

'Geraint can be rightly proud of the huge contribution to Kent cricket that he has made over his career. He has followed in a great line of Kent wicketkeeper-batsmen and will take his place in that dynasty.'

Jones played 34 Tests and and 49 one-day internationals for England although he was one of the casualties of the 2006-07 Ashes whitewash defeat, when he was dropped after the third Test in Perth.

He made his first-class debut in 2001 and was part of the side that lifted the Pro40 title that season as well as the domestic Twenty20 crown six years later.

'I would like to thank the members and supporters for the backing they have given me over my time at Kent,' he said.

'I will look back with a tremendous amount of pride on all that I have achieved with the county.'
