Neighbour from Hell: Leslie Collins, 68, who has been jailed at Leicester Crown Court for a 10-year campaign of abuse, which included hurling a bucket of human excrement at his neighbours property

A man who hurled buckets of human excrement at his neighbours’ property has been jailed.

Leslie Collins had made local residents’ lives 'hell' for ten years after he repeatedly ignored court orders and carried on with his noisy and illegal woodworking business in a residential cul-de-sac.

The 68-year-old carpenter also waged a spiteful campaign against a couple next door, Michael and Shirley Pollard, by throwing buckets of human excrement mixed with oil and water over the fence into their garden and up the house wall.

Collins, of Rockland Rise, Whitwick, 
Leicestershire, was jailed for a total of two years and 10 months - of 
which he is expected to serve half.

He
admitted twice breaching an anti-social behaviour order, relating to 
the throwing of human waste, as well as damaging the Pollards’ 
drainpipe, in March and April this year.

Collins
also admitted operating a waste facility - a wood recycling business - 
without an environment permit, between February and November last year.

After
the hearing at Leicester Crown Court, the Pollards and two other 
couples who attended court spoke of their delight at the jail sentence.

After
years of enduring continual machine noise, a radio blaring outside at 
night and general verbal abuse, they described it 'like winning the 
lottery'.

Mr Pollard, 68, said: 'In the end I installed a CCTV camera in a tree in the garden that captured him throwing excrement and putting cement down my drain.

'We had nails and glass put on the drive and I must have had 25 punctures over the years.'

Another neighbour Joan Elliott, 82, said: 'Now he’s in prison, we’re going to have peace and quiet at last. We’re all ecstatic as he was a nasty piece of work.'

Margaret Walne, 68, said: 'We’d forgotten what it’s like to live a normal life. It now means we can open our windows and spend time in our gardens.

'Collins would shout abuse at us and even swore at visiting grandchildren.'

Her husband Rodney Walne, 71, said: 'Thankfully, the judge understood how bad it’s been. Collins has got what he deserves.'

During the hearing, Tim Green, prosecuting on behalf of the Environment Agency, said: 'It was a deliberate and sustained campaign of anti-social behaviour.

Neighbours, whose lives had been made a misery by Collins, were delighted at the prison sentence. Pictured left to right, Shirley Pollard, Michael Pollard, Joan Elliott, Douglas Elliott, Margaret Walne and Rodney Walne

'He’s been described as a neighbour from hell. He’d receive deliveries of waste wood at his suburban home in the form of wooden pallets and cut them up with a chainsaw and hammers to make kindle. It happened at all hours.'

Mr Pollard and his neighbours said they were thankful the Environment Agency stepped in to prosecute.

Sentencing Collins at Leicester Crown Court, pictured, Judge Michael Pert QC said: 'You made your neighbours lives a misery.'

Paul Tubb, mitigating, said Collins lived 'an isolated and unconventional' lifestyle since separating from his wife in 1986 and was estranged from his son. He did not have a television or a cooker.

Sentencing Collins, Judge Michael Pert QC said: 'You were running a woodworking business without a licence from the environment agency. You made your neighbours lives a misery.'

He said the human waste-throwing incidents were 'disgusting'.

Collins has previously been prosecuted and fined for earlier breaches of his Asbo - which the judge renewed for five years.
