He's clearly a sharp dresser with his own distinct style.

And if you heard him speak, his cockney accent would be as broad as the River Thames.

This is Derek Hockley, the wheeler-dealer who David Jason has revealed he took as his inspiration when playing Del Boy in Only Fools and Horses.

As well as draping himself in gold jewellery and wearing a camel-hair coat, Mr Hockley regularly told his family ‘we’re going to be millionaires’ and had the swagger of an ‘I’m-a-Mr-Someone-Special’.

Inspiration: Derek Hockley, left, gave David Jason the pattern for his inspiration in playing Derek Trotter, right, and he picked up on many of Hockley's mannerisms, and imitated his dress sense

Sir David first met Mr Hockley when he was working as an electrician on a building site almost 20 years before the hit show was created by writer John Sullivan.

Pictures from the 1950s released to the Mail by Mr Hockley’s daughter Jan Wilson show just how true Del Boy was to her father.

Sir David imitated not just his sense of style, but also his accent, mannerisms and catchphrases.

The actor has told that he was initially suggested for the part of Granddad in Only Fools and Horses, but insisted on auditioning to play Derek Trotter after reading the script and thinking: ‘I know this man.’

In his book My Life, Sir David wrote: ‘Right there in my flat as I read [the script], I was spun back to the days going round to builders’ yards and literally knocking on the door in search of electrical work.

'In the East End of London we had happened on a contractor called Derek Hockley – a real East End player in a camel-hair coat, with immaculately greased hair and sharp clothing.

‘He had a cockney accent you could have rolled up and beaten someone over the head with, and a habit of bringing his top lip slightly forward and flexing his neck as if trying to get the collar of his shirt to settle down.

Wheeler-dealer: Mr Hockley, like Del Boy, was always on the look-out for a way to make money

‘I could hear Derek Hockley’s voice and see his manner as clear as day in the character on the typewritten pages in front of me.’ While renovating properties during the day and selling on old furniture at night, Mr Hockley would insist on being impeccably presented at all times.

And it seems the Trotters’ yellow three-wheeled Reliant Regal could have been inspired by the bright yellow Austin Healey Sprite Mr Hockley surprised his wife Joyce with.

While the scriptwriters thought Del Boy – who lived in Peckham, South East London –  should be scruffy and have a fat belly, Sir David resisted.

‘I pressed hard for taking him in the direction of Derek Hockley – this cockney who dressed like a fashion model but spoke like a docker,’ he wrote.

‘Derek Hockley became the image I took for Derek Trotter.’ Sir David owed much to Mr Hockley, who gave him a lot of work as an electrician and much-needed cash when he was a struggling young part-time actor.

He was concerned that being associated with Del Boy ‘had upset him or even ruined the poor bloke’s life’ but Mr Hockley’s daughter wrote to assure him her father was delighted with the imitation.

Mrs Wilson, 65, who lives in Spain with her husband Richard, used to run a bar called  Del Boy’s in Torrevieja on the Costa Blanca in memory of her father.

Her father remained close to Sir David, who visited him when he was dying in hospital to show him an award he had won playing Del Boy. Mr Hockley grew up in Newham, East London, and served in the Army in the Second World War as a caterer.

He married Joyce in 1945 in his uniform. They had two daughters, Jan and Julia, before they separated when the girls were in their teens.

‘David Jason would always say to Rodney, “This time next year, we’ll be millionaires!” and my dad always used to say the same – “We’re going to be millionaires!”,’ said Mrs Wilson.

‘He worked very hard and he did quite a lot of wheeling and dealing. He wasn’t doing anything bad.

Relationship: David Jason remained in touch with Mr Hockley. Mrs Wilson poses here with a later from Sir David to her father.

‘He would buy up old properties and renovate them. If the people said “just clear everything out” he would keep some of it and sell off the rest.

‘He would always come up with something, an antique, some sort of bargain.’ Mrs Wilson said Mr Hockley’s flamboyant dress sense was something that ran in his family.

‘He had this camel-haired coat, which he would walk onto the building site with. With gold, he loved gold: The necklace; the rings.

‘His mother and father were very well dressed. Nanny used to have a chest of drawers with silk clothes in them and lovely jewellery. Loads of beads. They were all very well dressed. It’s a family thing. ’

Above all, Mr Hockley, like Del Boy, is said to have had a big heart and a wicked sense of humour. ‘When they laid dad out, he wanted to be in his cravat and his suit. It was a red cravat because he always wore very loud clothes,’ Mrs  Wilson added.
