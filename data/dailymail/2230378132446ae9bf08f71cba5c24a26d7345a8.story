They are the words guaranteed to induce dread in any supermarket shopper: 'Unexpected item in the bagging area. Please remove this item before continuing.'

But the identity of the woman behind the robotic command at more than 10,000 self-service check outs across the UK has remained a mystery.

Today, however, it has emerged that the dulcet tones belong to former EastEnders actress Helena Breck.

Secret: The voice of self service checkouts that leaves shoppers across the UK embarrassed has been revealed as Helena Breck (left) who played the gritty role of Elizabeth Willmott-Brown in EastEnders in 1994

It will surprise many as the well-spoken, non-confrontational warning seems worlds away from Albert Square.

Ms Breck played Elizabeth Wilmott-Brown - the wife of James Wilmott-Brown who raped Phil Mitchell's girlfriend - in the BBC's flagship soap in 1994.

But in 2008, she was snapped up by the National Cash Register (NCR) to record the fateful words that would be played at more than 10,000 of the nation's major supermarkets including Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's.

Though other voices have been brought in since, Ms Breck's remains a favourite for stores.

While the satnav industry is proud to promote its invisible stars, who include half-a-dozen mature British actresses with beautifully modulated voices, along with a few jokey contributors such as Brian Blessed and John Cleese, the NCR has refused to name Ms Breck.

Speaking in 2010, Helen McInnes, spokesman for the American company, said: 'Her identity is a closely-guarded secret.

Dynamic: Voiceover and television actress Ms Breck, whose non-confrontational voice emanates from check outs, has starred in gritty soaps including the hit ITV drama Crown Court in 1981

'We wouldn't want our competitors to take on the same voice.'

Explaining the casting process, she said: 'The person has been chosen for having
 a calming voice and an approachable manner.'

In laboratory and shop 
studies, customers 'overwhelmingly responded better to the female 
voice'.

Ms Breck, who last recorded a supermarket command in February 2009, said she tries her best to distance herself from the iconic role to concentrate on new, different work.

She told MailOnline: 'It can impinge on being booked for other work as people think you're still attached to that.

'I still hear myself sometimes when I go into the supermarket but they have new voices now and I am doing other things.'
