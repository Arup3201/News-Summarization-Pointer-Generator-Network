Britain's largest electricity supplier EDF will pay back a paltry £50 to households as penance for its doorstep selling practices.

The French-owned energy giant admitted door-to-door staff were not trained to give customers all the information they needed.

And call centre workers trying to sell the firm’s energy tariffs would boast about possible savings without knowing whether the statements were accurate.

£4.5m settlement: EDF staff failed to provide potential customers with complete information, ruled Ofgem

An investigation by energy watchdog Ofgem exposed gaping holes in EDF’s policies designed to prevent vulnerable customers being ripped off by cold-calling salesmen. While the firm did have measures in place, they did not go far enough, the regulator ruled.

Faced with a mammoth fine, the power group said it would pay out £3.5million to the poorest households it supplies.

But the sum comes to only £50 for  each of the 70,000 homes judged to be ‘needy’ by the firm.

The company also agreed to pay £1million to an energy awareness campaign run by Citizens Advice.

The £4.5million total is, however, the largest penalty payout ever demanded from an energy firm in this country.

The 70,000 homes receiving the one-off payment are already on the company’s Warm Home Discount scheme, where they receive a rebate of £120 a year. 

However, the average EDF dual fuel bill 
is still £1,129 each year, and even with the extra £50 saving, families 
will have to fork out almost £1,000 to heat their homes.

EDF acknowledged 'limited shortcomings' during 2010

Last month EDF Energy unveiled profits of £1.6billion – £427 for each of its 3.7million UK customers.

Yesterday the company admitted ‘limited shortcomings’ in its sales in 2010 – the period investigated by Ofgem.

Martin Lawrence, managing director of energy sourcing and customer supply, said: ‘We’re obviously disappointed that we failed to live up to the high standards that we expect of ourselves.

‘As soon as the issue was identified we immediately took action.’

Ofgem is also investigating ScottishPower, SSE (formerly Scottish and Southern Energy) and npower.

Sarah Harrison, of Ofgem, said:'In the energy market in general much 
more needs to be done to restore consumer confidence and all energy 
suppliers should now get behind Ofgem’s reforms to introduce a simpler, 
clearer and more competitive energy market.'

The EDF payout comes just 24 hours after it was named the worst of the major power suppliers for customer service.

Audrey Gallacher, director of energy at Consumer Focus, said it was positive that an energy company has worked with the regulator to tackle the issue.

She added: 'We've called for Ofgem to have the power to make sure energy customers benefit from any fines - so it's good news that this voluntary approach has led to customers being compensated rather than money returned to the Treasury.'

Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey said tougher rules were now in place over the information suppliers have to provide to their customers.

He added: 'We are now looking at beefing up Ofgem's powers further so it can make companies compensate consumers directly in cases like this, rather than having to rely on a voluntary approach.'
