A nationwide search by Women's Health magazine for 'The Body 2014' found women who aren't just committed gym bunnies - but also converts to the positive emotional effects of exercise.

The competition was judged by Olympic Champion Cyclist Victoria Pendleton, Dancer Kimberly Wyatt, Women's Health Editor Farrah Storr and Fitness Model Nathalie Schyllert who were looking for women who had achieved their bodies in a way that was realistic, balanced and inspiring.

Stevie Hartley, a beautician from Harlow, struggled with post-natal depression but discovered work out DVDs

22-year-old Stevie Hartley, a  beautician from Harlow, also triumphed over thousands of entrants to be selected, as well as battling with post-natal depression.

Stevie embraced exercise as much for its mental benefits as the physical effects. 'I wanted to pull myself out of the hole. So when I saw an advert for the Insanity workout DVDs, I phoned up immediately. At first, it was so hard – after each session, my muscles were burning.' 

'But I started seeing results in two weeks. I dropped a dress size and saw amazing definition in my stomach and legs that it spurred me on. It helped to clear my mind, too.'

Jennifer Prosser, a 27-year-old beautician from Didsbury, works out with her newborn baby Madison

Jennifer Prosser, a 27-year-old beautician from Didsbury, reached the final five despite gaining 2st when she was pregnant with her first child.

She says: 'It was important for me to get back in shape. It took three months to lose the baby weight – but I did it gradually and sensibly.'

Just four weeks after giving birth to daughter Madison she was back in the gym hitting the treadmill and says she is now fitter than she was before giving birth.

Jennifer says: 'Each morning, I’ll do squats and hold Madison out in front of me – she’ll giggle while I do it. I push myself harder because I only have an hour to work out. But the payoff has been immense. My whole body is stronger than it was, pre-baby.'

Marcia Copertino's whole life was chaos after her divorce but hitting the gym helped her to regain confidence

Finalist Marcia Copertino, a 32-year-old bar manager from Glasgow, found exercise helped her to get through her divorce. 

She says: “I walked away with nothing – no money (he’d always taken control of our finances, so I didn’t even have a bank account); no self-esteem and no idea of my future. I slept on friends’ couches while I saved enough money from the bar job I’d taken to get back on my feet.”

Joining the gym helped her to regain confidence and find fulfillment.

'Exercise was what made me happy. So I hit the gym almost every day, cramming in a few hours of cardio and weights in between bar shifts. As my physical strength grew, so too did my mental health.'

'It’s taken three years to get my body looking like this – but it’s more than that. Exercise has given me a confidence I never thought was possible. It’s helped me channel all the pain I felt into a positive force. It has been my salvation.'

Maya Basse, 26, had insecurities about her body as a teenager so took charge and started to love her shape

Maya Basse, a 26-year-old primary school teacher from London, was also selected as a finalist in the competition. 

As a teenager growing up in Australia she hated her body, which was the result of long-distance running with her father. as a teenager left Maya with a body she loathed. 

'All my friends were quite skinny. They could wear anything they wanted, while I struggled to find clothes to fit. I blamed my body for that.'

After moving to the UK and going through a painful break up Maya joined the gym to motivate herself. 

'I hit the weights and began to balance out my shape. As my strength grew, so too did my confidence. Working out, and starting to love my shape again was the one thing that kept me sane through those first lonely months in a new country. I honestly believe I would have given up and gone home if it weren’t for fitness. It’s truly changed my life.'

PR director Natalia Bojanic's lifestyle was too hectic to find time to exercise but now she even chooses her holidays based on her fitness routine

Natalia Bojanic, 31, struggled to fit in exercise when her life became a haze of drinks, parties and long hours due to her work in communications. 'I tried to fit in exercise when I could, and eat on the hop, but I found it tough. Two years ago, my dinner and canape-filled lifestyle finally got to me, so I got back in to my fitness and rejoined a gym.'

Even her holiday choices and social life are dictated by her new found enthusiasm for exercise. 

'When I go on holiday, I choose somewhere I can go hiking, sailing or playing beach volleyball. That way, I never lose momentum. Or if I’m working late at an event I always eat before I go, so I’m not tempted by the delicious – but unhealthy – food on offer and I’ll have just one glass of champagne and savour it.'
