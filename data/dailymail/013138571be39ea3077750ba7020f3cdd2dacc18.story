Thomas Aiken may not be defending his title, but South African players will look to maintain their stranglehold on the Africa Open in East London this week.

England's Andy Sullivan is favourite to spoil their plans after winning the Joburg Open last Sunday, the 27-year-old claiming his second European Tour title in South Africa in the space of eight weeks.

But home players have won the event every year since it began in 2010, with former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel winning the inaugural event and being followed into the winners' circle by fellow major winner Louis Oosthuizen (twice), Darren Fichardt and Aiken.

Aiken's win 12 months ago helped him top the Sunshine Tour Order of Merit and secure a place in the field for the WGC-Cadillac Championship, which is also being staged this week at Doral.

That leaves the likes of Fichardt and George Coetzee to lead the home challenge, with Coetzee keen to keep the trophy in South African hands.

'It was my first time playing (in 2010) and it was a big deal to see all the foreign players pull into East London,' said Coetzee, who finished 24th in the defence of his Joburg Open last week.

'Since then the Africa Open always attracts a strong contingent of local and international players. The crowds are always fantastic, because they are lively but very neutral. They just want to watch some great golf and they cheer for everyone. It's fun to play in front of galleries like that.

'Personally, I would very much like to put my name below Thomas' on the trophy before the international players have their day.'

European Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke is a notable name in the field but it is Sullivan, however, who looks most likely to gatecrash the home party.

'I think if I did I'd become one of the most hated people down here, so I'm not sure if I want to win this week,' Sullivan joked. 'But obviously it would be great to get a victory down here as well.

'It's quite hard because we go from week to week so it still has not sunk in yet. I am on the crest of a wave and just want to keep riding it and hopefully keep going this week. I'm looking forward to the task at hand, I think the wind is going to keep the scoring pretty fair and it should be fun.

'It's a hell of a lot different to last week where we were just hitting the ball straight up in the air, it could be a massive change to what we are used to but I've had a couple of days in the wind now to get used to it and a feel for the course. We are professional golfers for a reason, we should be able to adapt.'

Four of the players who finished runner-up to Sullivan last week - David Howell, Jaco van Zyl, Wallie Coetsee and Kevin Phelan - are in the field at East London, along with Oliver Fisher, who lost out in a play-off to Aiken 12 months ago.

'I have fond memories of the place, it was a good week last year and hopefully I can have a good week again,' Fisher said. 'Last year I started well here to set the season off on a good tone and it's always nice to get off to a good start.'
