The Massachusetts hero who had his boat seized in April after finding the Boston bombing suspect hiding inside will has bought a new vessel with the help of donors across America.

David Henneberry became a national figure after finding Dzhokhar Tsarnaev inside his 22-foot Seahawk on April 19 and a crowdfunding campaign quickly began to brim with donations thereafter in an effort to raise $50,000 so the Watertown man could buy himself a new boat.

That goal was met and then some. Now, Henneberry has purchased a used vessel he modestly calls a 'fixer-upper' and plans to give the money left over to charity.

Overwhelmed: David Henneberry calmly called 911 after finding Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in his boat. He was quickly dubbed a hero, but the FBI quickly carted his beloved boat away

'We just recently, two weeks ago, got a used boat,' Henneberry told ABCNews.com. 'We did accept [the $50,000] and we did also request that anything over that went to the One Fund. It just seemed right to do.'

The One Fund is a charity put in place to help victims of the savage April 15 attack and their families.

The crowdsourced funds came from a site called Crowdtilt. Craig Dunlap dubbed the campaign 'Let's Fix David Henneberry's Boat (That Got Ruined in the Boston Bomber's Standoff)!'

But that's not precisely how it happened.

Sighted: Tsarnaev rises from Henneberry's boat with a laser sight on his forehead at the time of his capture

Sinking feeling: The suspected terrorist engaged authorities in a shootout that left the boat, dubbed Slip Away, riddled with holes

Generous: A campaign to replace Henneberry's boat quickly popped up on Crowdtilt.com. Just days after the campaign began, it had received $50,597.50

'It was actually taken by the FBI, but that's another thing,' he said.

Donations began to flood in within days after Tsarnaev's capture, as did postcards and letters of thanks, which Henneberry found extremely touching.

'You just want to ramble on you feel so grateful,' Henneberry told ABC. 'After such a bad thing happened to us and the people of Boston, it was wonderful to see that. It was humbling.'

By April 30, the fund exceeded its goal. Thanks to a large donation from the Boston Whaler boat company, Henneberry received exactly $50,597.

'It restores your faith in people,' he said. 'They don't know me.'

Henneberry named his new boat after his wife, dubbing it Beth Said Yes. His old boat was called Slip Away.

'That's fitting, isn't it?' he laugh. 'We decided we're just going to let Slip Away slip away.'

History: Henneberry said that he saw a 'good amount' of blood in the cabin, and then a body. He calmly called 911 and the rest is history...along with the boat
