At the time of kick-off, the most popular YouTube clip of Erik Lamela's 'Rabona' goal had amassed a staggering 2.3m views in just three days.

It's fair to say highlights of the Argentine's performance in Tottenham's miserable defeat to Newcastle United won't have quite the same viral appeal.

Lamela, like the entire Spurs team, was struck down at White Hart Lane by that most unpleasant of afflictions - a Europa League hangover.

Three days after enchanting the world with his outrageous goal against Asteras Tripolis, Lamela cut an aloof and ineffective figure as Spurs slumped to defeat.

His passing was crisp and accurate in the main but failed to release his team-mates into dangerous positions as Spurs were left stunned by Newcastle's double blast at the start of the second-half.

Any hopes of carrying the feel-good factor from Thursday night into this match were quickly forgotten.

Lamela started on the right flank but didn't see anything of the ball during the opening stages. Indeed, it was 15 minutes in before he enjoyed a proper feel for it, though an end product was lacking.

Increasingly frustrated, he migrated over to the left and slowly gained a foothold in the game, picking passes in and around the edge of the penalty box.

There was even a Zidane-esque pirouette on the half-way line that left two Newcastle players bamboozled but it again led nowhere.

Lamela's lack of influence scarcely mattered because Tottenham had the lead, gained when Emmanuel Adebayor headed in Ryan Mason's brilliant cross. Lamela was at the forefront of the celebrations having helped the move along with a pass..

Spurs were in control but Newcastle emerged from half-time a completely different proposition.

Eric Dier had admitted in the build-up to the match that his upbrining in Portgual meant he was unaware that the clocks go back every autumn in Britain.

The 20-year-old was certainly behind time when Sami Ameobi steamed past him straight from the kick-off and levelled for Newcastle just six seconds in.

And the game was flipped on its head shortly afterwards when Ayoze Perez headed home his first Premier League goal from a Remy Cabella cross.

Lamela wasn't at fault for Newcastle's two goals and it overshadowed his brightest period in the match. There were a few step-overs and shoulder-drops but, with Spurs trailing, it was hardly the time for showboating.

Eventually, Mauricio Pochettino had seen enough and Lamela was hooked off for Aaron Lennon with 12 minutes left.

It had been a performance that again raised questions about Lamela's effectiveness in the Premier League.

Scoring wonderful goals against Greeks bearing gifts is one thing. To replicate that impact at this higher standard quite another.
