Harry Kane has revealed he can't believe a 'crazy' year at Tottenham has culminated in his first call-up for the senior England squad.

Kane was given the nod by Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson for the forthcoming Euro qualifier with Lithuania, followed by the friendly with Italy after bagging 26 goals 42 games for Spurs this season.

The Chingford-born forward was a regular on the Tottenham bench until November, but has blossomed from bit-part player into one of the Premier League's most deadly strikers.

Kane said: 'I haven't had time to sit down and think about what's happened. It's obviously been a hectic season - a lot has been happening, but I'm enjoying every minute of it and I just want it to continue.

'It's crazy how things can change in football in such a short space of time. I can remember coming off the bench against Benfica and nearly getting that big comeback win away from home.

'But we're here now and it's crazy, but it's what I've always wanted to achieve.'

Hodgson - who made the announcement at Wembley Stadium - also called-up his team-mates Kyle Walker and Andros Townsend to the 24-man squad.

'I think the whole country is excited about Harry,' said the England boss. 'It would have been a surprise if he wasn't selected.'

Kane is refusing to allow himself to get carried away, but has set his sights firmly on winning that all-important first cap, despite competition coming from Wayne Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck.

'It's a very proud moment for me and my family. It's an honour to be called up to the senior side and something I always dreamed of as a kid, when I got the message I was full of joy and hope it's the first of many.

'I'll be aiming to go there and compete for places, try and get myself into the team. There's a lot of great players there and I know that.'

England meet Lithuania at Wembley on March 27 in their Group E Euro 2016 qualifier before a friendly in Turin against Italy on March 31.
