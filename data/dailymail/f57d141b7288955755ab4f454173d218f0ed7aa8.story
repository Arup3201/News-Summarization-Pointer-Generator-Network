A Boston police officer of 16 years has been charged with beating an Uber taxi driver who dropped him off at the wrong location. 

Michael Doherty, 40, from South Boston, started yelling abuse at the driver when he accused him of going to the wrong destination. 

He then attacked him and allegedly made racial slurs against the victim. 

A police report said veteran officer Michael Doherty beat an Uber driver who dropped him in the wrong place

According to a police report, veteran officer Doherty started yelling abuse at the driver when he started travelling to the wrong destination in the early hours of Sunday morning. 

When the driver stopped his car at the location at 2.45am - on the corner of East 2nd Street and M Street in South Boston - the veteran police officer said they were in the wrong place. 

According to a report obtained by the Boston Globe, Doherty said: 'What, you think I'm stupid, you (expletive),' followed by a racist term for Latinos. 

The victim said Doherty then physically assaulted him and so he ran out of his taxi. 

Once outside the car, the victim claimed Doherty got in to the front seat and drove off. 

The victim, who was aided by a passing motorist, followed the victim to East 1st Street and Farragut Road where Doherty stopped and exited the Uber cab. 

He walked towards the Uber driver and the man who provided help - who was black - and reportedly said, 'what do you want, you n*****?'

He then allegedly hit the Uber driver to the ground and repeatedly punched him as the other man tried to pull Doherty off.

Doherty, a Boston police officer of 16 years, has been put on administrative leave by the force (headquarters pictured) pending the outcome of the charges filed against him 

The police officer then fled the area before the police arrived. 

He was later identified, located and placed under arrest and charged him with assault and battery and using a motor vehicle without authority. 

Doherty has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the charges filed against him.

The Boston Police Anti-Corruption Unit said it was actively reviewing the 'facts and circumstance surrounding this incident.' 

Uber, the popular ride-sharing service, said in a statement their thoughts were with the driver, adding they have barred Doherty from using the service and 'stand ready to assist law enforcement' in the investigation. 

Uber, established in 2009, is present in dozens of countries and recently attracted investment which values it at $40bn.
