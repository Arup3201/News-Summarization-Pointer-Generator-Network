Mark McGhee fears the Scottish Premiership will be badly damaged by the absence of three of the nation’s largest clubs next season.

And the Scotland assistant manager has also expressed concerns the national team’s progress could falter if Hearts, Rangers and Hibs fail to quickly return to the top flight.

Addressing the radically changing landscape of Scottish football ahead of Tuesday night’s friendly international with Nigeria at Craven Cottage, the former Motherwell and Aberdeen boss admitted he never imagined a day when there would no Rangers nor Edinburgh clubs in the Premiership.

Fear: Mark McGhee is scared the Scottish Premiership will be damaged by the absence of three of the nation's largest club's next season

‘You have to say congratulations to Hamilton. They deserve all the credit for getting promoted and getting the result they did after losing the first leg. So you can’t take anything away from them,’ he said. 

‘You can’t argue that they deserve to be there less than Hibs or anybody else. They’re there by merit.

‘But a league without Hibs, Hearts, Rangers? I could never have imagined that in my lifetime.

‘That’s a real shame because they are among the bigger clubs in the country and they benefit the league by being in it. The league loses something by them not being it, for sure.’ 

Rangers keeper Cammy Bell is the only player from Ibrox, Tynecastle or Easter Road currently in the Scotland squad who trained twice at QPR’s training ground on Monday.

And McGhee fears that’s how it will remain until the three clubs can find a way back to health and start feeding the national team once more.

‘It shouldn’t impact in the sense that we’ve got a squad here that we think we can do well with,’ he said, ‘but there’s absolutely no doubt about it, Hearts, Hibs and Rangers are clubs of a stature that should just about be able produce players - and have players in their team - that would be in the international squad.

‘And they haven’t at the moment. That is a shame.’

As Motherwell manager when Hamilton took barely 400 supporters to Lanarkshire derbies, the former Celtic striker harbours concerns about the overall spectacle of the game without three of the clubs with the most signficant average home attendances.

‘I think it’s huge. It’s one of the things that frustrates me. We spoke about this when we used to go to these meetings at Hampden when I was at Motherwell and Aberdeen.

‘We used to even ask why can’t they place the camera at Inverness where you  can see the crowd instead of the sea? 

‘Try and give a backdrop to Scottish football. We used to talk about how teams like Inverness could go to Celtic Park and play brilliantly but the games weren’ t shown because they were at home.

‘So it’s all important, for the sake of the game, to promote it in a positive way.  It doesn’t always come across that way. 

‘Now, without the names of Hibs, Hearts and Rangers in the division, I think it is lacking.’
