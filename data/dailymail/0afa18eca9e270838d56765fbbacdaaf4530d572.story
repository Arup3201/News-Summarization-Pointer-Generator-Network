A tank belong to a British Army driving school ended up crashing into a house in Germany after a technical fault meant it veered off course.

Ulrich and Magdalene Tilsner rushed to their front window after hearing what they thought sounded like a bomb going off outside.

But when they pulled back the curtains, they discovered that a British Army owned tank had ploughed into their fence and crushed their hedge.

The British Army tank which crashed into an elderly couple's home in Germany after suffering from a technical fault 

The couple were about to leave the house in Paderborn to meet their granddaughter Stefanie Ney but they called her saying they had a tank in their garden.

She rushed straight to their house and said she discovered a scene of chaos.

She told the Neue Westfälische newspaper: 'There was a tank in the hedge and soldiers standing everywhere and our dog was barking like crazy.

'My Oma (grandma) was completely in shock. '

The occupants walked away from the crash unscathed but it is estimated that the collision caused 1,000 euros worth of damage to Mr and Mrs Tilsner's property and plants.

According to police, the tank suffered a fault with with its drive chain, which caused it to run amok and veer off course before crashing into the wall.

British forces are based in the town of Paderborn, pictured, where they have a military driving school where the tank came from 

It then took police and the British Army several hours to remove the tank from the garden.

The tank came from the nearby military driving school at the Paderborn British Army Garrison in northern Germany.

Forces have been stationed at the garrison on the Rhine since the end of the Second World War.

However, two years ago it was announced by the then Defence Secretary Philip Hammond that troops would be returning to bases in the UK.
