The injuries of one of the teenage girls attacked with acid were made worse when desperate helpers threw dirty water over her, it has emerged.

Details of the horrifying attack have also revealed the two British teenagers, who suffered horrific burns when the acid was thrown at them, saw their attackers smile and nod to each other moments before throwing the liquid.

Voluntary workers Katie Gee and Kirstie Trup, both 18, arrived back in the country yesterday and were transferred to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London, where their conditions have been described as 'stable'.

Sam Jones, who was on the holiday 
island of Zanzibar with his girlfriend Nadine at the time, has told The Sun 
how he heard their screams following the attack and found one of them 
crouching by a toilet block in pain.

He told the newspaper the girls said they had been walking along a street when a moped carrying two men drew up alongside them and stopped.

He
said: 'The men looked at each other, nodded and smiled - then one of 
them threw the acid on to them from a container, like a petrol can.'

Mr Jones said he, Nadine and a group of local people found Katie by a toilet block screaming in pain.

He said: 'Her clothing disintegrated in minutes. There was a putrid, pungent smell.'

He said the acid was so powerful that it burnt his hands as he tried to help the teenager.

The
couple said they supported the injured women by joining them on a 
private plane to Tanzania's capital Dar es Salaam for treatment.

Five men have been questioned by officers in connection with the acid attack on the holiday island of Zanzibar.

Police have said the men had not been arrested and were co-operating with the investigation.

Mkadam Khamis, regional police commissioner on Zanzibar, told the Daily Telegraph: 'There are five people we have, all men, who we are interrogating over this matter this morning.

'They have not yet been arrested. They are co-operating and answering our questions.

'Later today maybe there will be a development legally.'

Yusuf Ilembo, deputy director of criminal investigations, said his detectives were exploring ‘many avenues of investigation, including political and religious’.

He added: ‘It is too soon to accuse anyone directly, but yes we are looking at those people and their supporters.’

Police are also hunting Sheikh Issa Ponda Issa, an inflammatory Muslim cleric who arrived on the island a week ago to build support for protests against the government.

Meanwhile, The Times has reported how
one of the girl's injuries are much worse than the other's, because 
helpers used dirty water on her burns.

Kirstie however is understood to have been taken to the sea in the aftermath of 
the attack at Stone Town, a beach resort, which reportedly saved her from the more serious injuries suffered by her friend.

Katie yesterday thanked supporters for their good wishes as the pair continued to recover in hospital.

The student took to Twitter to say: 'Thank you for all your support x'.

She
sent the message from the capital's regional burns centre where her and 
Kirstie were receiving treatment after arriving back in 
the country yesterday.

Their
medic, Andy Williams, consultant burns and plastic surgeon, said: 'We 
can confirm that Katie and Kirstie have been transferred to our care at 
Chelsea and Westminster Hospital's burns unit where we're still 
assessing their injuries.

'Both girls are well and their families are with them. They will be staying at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.

'Both families would like to thank everyone that's helped to bring the girls back.

'The families now wish to have time with the girls and that the media would respect their privacy at this difficult time.'

Five men are 
being questioned by police on the Indian Ocean island after the women 
were attacked as they walked along a road on 
Wednesday night.

Mkadam
Khamis, regional police commissioner on Zanzibar, told the Daily 
Telegraph: 'There are five people we have, all men, who we are 
interrogating over this matter this morning.

'They have not yet been arrested. They are co-operating and answering our questions.

Yusuf Ilembo, deputy director of criminal investigations, said his detectives were exploring ‘many avenues of investigation, including political and religious’.

He added: ‘It is too soon to accuse anyone directly, but yes we are looking at those people and their supporters.’

Police are also hunting Sheikh Issa 
Ponda Issa, an inflammatory Muslim cleric who arrived on the island a 
week ago to build support for protests against the government.

The young women, from north London, 
were enjoying the last week of a trip as volunteer teachers to the 
predominantly Muslim island when the corrosive substance was thrown at 
them in an apparently unprovoked attack.

Kirstie's father Marc had earlier described the girls as 'inconsolable' when he spoke to them after the attack.

They were flown to the Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam for treatment before being released.

Speaking
about the terrifying moments after learning they had been attacked, he 
told the Times: 'We couldn't get anything out of them because they had 
been burned...Both girls are very shocked and very frightened.'

Speaking about his daughter, he added: 'She can still see and she is not dead. Whatever it is we will cope with it.'

Mr
Trup said the girls were dressed appropriately and had been warned not 
to wear anything which gave away their Jewish background, including the 
Star of David.

He told 
the newspaper: 'We know it's a Muslim country, they were Western girls. 
Unfortunately they went out during the month of Ramadan.

'There has been a huge alert in African countries with potential threats. Maybe it's connected, maybe not.'

Recovery: Kirstie Trup is due to return to her family home in north London to start her recovery from the acid attack

The
girls had originally planned to return in time to collect their A-Level
results next week, with Kirstie hoping to study history at the 
University of Bristol while Miss Gee is considering the University of 
Leeds, it was reported.

Zanzibar is an archipelago of islands in the Indian Ocean about 22 miles off the mainland.

The
semi-autonomous region of Tanzania is predominantly Muslim and has been
the scene of some religious violence in recent years.

'She can still see and she is not dead. Whatever it is we will cope with it'

Earlier this year two Christian leaders were killed and in November a cleric was treated in hospital after an acid attack.

The attack happened in the Stone Town area of Zanzibar's eponymous capital city.

i-to-i
Travel, the company the girls used to volunteer abroad, said today: 'We
welcome the proactive investigations being carried out by local 
authorities in Zanzibar and continue to liaise with them.

'We
have been in contact with all of our customers who remain in Zanzibar 
and provided them all with a copy of our recommended safety measures 
from their pre-tour safety guide and advised them to remain vigilant 
during the remainder of their stay.

'We also recommend they refer to the FCO advice.

'Customers
due to arrive into Zanzibar this weekend have been given the option to 
volunteer at an alternative project and all have chosen to continue to 
travel to Tanzania.'
