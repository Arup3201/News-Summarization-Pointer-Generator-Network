Enjoying an extensive wardrobe crammed with trendy outfits, monthly trips to the beauty salon and an exclusively organic diet, this diva could give any pampered princess a run for her money.

No, not hairdresser Carly Guglielmucci, but rather her pet shih tzu Gizmo.

The 23-year-old spends up to £500 a month on her dog's lavish lifestyle, and even took on a second job to help pay for matching miniature outfits for her 'fur baby' Gizmo so they can look the same when they go out walking.

Doggie double: Carly Guglielmucci chose a miniature Santa outfit for her dog Gizmo that matches her red gilet

Miss Guglielmucci, from Cumnock, Scotland, decided to get a dog after becoming broody when her friends began having babies, and now admits she treats Gizmo more like a child than a pet.

'I would look at friend's babies and wish I had one of my own -
but at the same time I felt too young to have a child,' the hairdresser said.

'I had seen Paris Hilton with her little dog and thought it looked really sweet so I decided to get a puppy.

'I found a breeder not far away selling shih tzu puppies for £450 and it
seemed like the next best thing to having a baby - and a lot less 
work.'

'Pampered': The 23-year-old took a second job as a waitress to fund Gizmo's wardrobe - which sets her back around £500 a month

After falling in love with tiny puppy
Gizmo - now six months old - Miss Guglielmucci spent £90 on a top of the range doggie bed for
her new pet to sleep in.

Two weeks later her obsession with 
dressing up her dog began when she spotted a tiny jacket in her friend's
pet shop and tried it on Gizmo.

'She had a wee army jacket that looked adorable,' she said.

'As soon as Gizmo put it on his 
little tail started wagging, and he was running around. We both thought 
it was the cutest thing we'd ever seen.'

The 23-year-old now splashes out on a new outfit for Gizmo every week.

'I've bought him a little Santa outfit for Christmas which I co-ordinate with a red fur-lined body-warmer. 

'I even managed to find a top which matches his army jacket.'

Being a trendsetter is tiring work: Gizmo's collection of outfits is now so extensive the dog has its very own miniature wardrobe

Miss Guglielmucci said she is now 
obsessed with Gizmo's wardrobe that she chooses outfits for her dog 
first, then buys herself things to match.

'Gizmo's outfits come first,' she said.

'We get dressed together in the morning.'

Her pet's clothing collection - which 
features a leather jacket, hoodies, a blazer and tie combo and even a tiny set of
trainers - is now so extensive she bought a miniature 
wardrobe to store them in.

Gizmo has become something of a 
celebrity in Miss Guglielmucci's hometown, where the pair regularly turn
heads while out for walkies in their matching outfits.

'Gizmo has the best of everything,' she said.

'Some people think it's weird but I just want the best for him. I put more thought into what he's wearing than I do for myself.

'But anyone who knows him will tell you he's got bags of personality.'

Devoted: Carly Gugliemucci takes Gizmo to a grooming salon every month to have its coat washed and blow dried and its nails clipped

Street-style: Six-month-old Gizmo eats only organic chicken dinners

Patriotic: Gizmo, who lives with owner Carly in Cumnock, Scotland, sports a purple argyle jumper

On top of £200 to £300 per month on 
clothes, accessories and toys for Gizmo, the devoted dog owner spends 
£100 a month on trips to the grooming salon and another £100 on organic 
meat and specialist dog food.

Miss Guglielmucci has even had to 
take on a second job as a waitress in a Chinese restaurant due to the 
mounting cost of Gizmo's lifestyle.

'My second job brings in an extra £500 per month - most of which goes on Gizmo,' she said.

'I know it might seem a bit extreme to get another job but dog toys and clothes aren't cheap.

'I don't really think about the amount I'm spending on him as it's not important. What's important is that he looks good.

'He comes everywhere with me. I take him to work and he never leaves my side.

'He's like a little celebrity in the town. Everyone knows him and think he's as cute as I do.'

While the hairdresser's boyfriend, 
joined David Kerr, 32, is bemused by the attention she lavishes on her 
pet, Miss Guglielmucci has no intention of letting Gizmo's image slide.

'When we met I already had Gizmo and I said if you want me you have to take him too,' she said.

'Occasionally you get the odd person saying what I'm doing is sick and I shouldn't treat him like he is a child.

'It does annoy me a bit, I'm not hurting anyone and it brings a smile to most people's faces.'
