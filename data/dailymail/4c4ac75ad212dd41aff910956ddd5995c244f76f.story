This haunting image of an empty road leading to an erupting volcano  was captured by a photographer who appears to be on the highway to hell.

The stunning snap was taken on Chain of Craters Road, near Pahoa, a small village under threat from volcanic lava flows on Hawaii's main island.

The road had only just been cleared after being covered by previous flows but the cause of that lava - the Pu'u O'o crater - can still be seen ominously spewing fire in the background.

DIY store worker and part-time photographer Ed Coykendall took a series of amazing pictures which show the strikingly bright orange of the volcanic explosion glowing against the pitch black night sky.

Despite working full-time, Coykendall and some of his friends often spend nights out in the Hawaiian bush photographing this amazing crater.

In some images the whole night sky above the local town is illuminated by the lava and in others the light produced by the volcano makes it look like an image from another world.

Hawaiian Coykendall has been fascinated by the Pu'u O'o crater - pronounced 'poo-oo oh-oh' - which is is a spatter cone in the eastern rift zone of the Kilauea volcano of the Hawaiian Islands.

It has been erupting continuously since January 3, 1983, making it the longest-lived rift-zone eruption of the last two centuries.

Dad-of-two Coykendall, 30, has lived in Hawaii for the last 20 years and works full-time as a supervisor at DIY store Home Depot.

He said: 'With my spare time I am also a photographer. I enjoy capturing moments in time to share to the world.

'With the highway to hell image it started off as any other night looking to view the eruption of the volcano.

'I meet up with two other photographer in the area Ken Boyer and David Smith. As we headed to the volcano the weather conditions were unfavourable so instead we decided to take pictures of the ocean.

'We got to the ocean and the weather was still pouring down rain. After waiting an hour for the rain to stop we gave up and started heading home. On the way back on a rarely travelled road called chain of craters the clouds opened up enough to see the glow of the lava in a distance.

'We never expected for this to happen and didnt even know that it could be seen so clearly at this location.

'We pulled over stood in amazement for about 15 minutes. We finally grabbed our camera gear out of the truck to capture what we had seen.

'This was a incredible experience for all of us seeing how the road just heads up to the lava going up the slopes of Kilauea.'
