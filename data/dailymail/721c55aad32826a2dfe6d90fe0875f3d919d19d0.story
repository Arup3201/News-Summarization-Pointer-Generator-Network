Banned: Guy Pelly, 30, has been banned from driving after he was caught speeding at 129 mph in an Audi R8 V10

A socialite friend of Prince William and Prince Harry was banned from driving yesterday.

Guy Pelly, who owns a nightclub, was caught by police while doing 129mph on a dual carriageway in a £100,000 Audi.

The 30-year-old failed to show up to answer the charge of speeding, claiming to be ill.

In his absence, magistrates banned him from driving for 56 days, fined him £750 and ordered him to pay £265 in costs.

They were told Pelly was in an Audi R8 V10 when he was stopped on the A303 near Salisbury in Wiltshire on March 17.

James Harrison, a barrister appearing on Pelly’s behalf, said his client had been speeding but not at 129mph.

However Adrian Ridley, the constable who stopped Pelly, told Salisbury magistrates there was nothing wrong with his speed gun.

Stowe-educated Pelly, from Kensington, West London, was banned in 2007 for speeding at 90mph on the M4 in his Volkswagen.

Nick Batty, of the road safety charity Brake, said his latest ban was too short.

He said: ‘Driving at a speed of 129mph is incredibly dangerous, risky and selfish behaviour which shows no concern for the law or for the safety of other road users.’

Pelly, from Kensington, London, has been friends with the Princes since he met them while fox hunting.

And it is thought he even helped organise William's stag do ahead of his marriage to Kate Middleton in April 2011.

Pelly was due to appear at Salisbury Magistrates' Court in person but failed to appear because he was ill.

The hearing went ahead in his absence.

PC Adrian Ridley told the court he had spotted Pelly's car from about 1km away and judged it was travelling 'significantly faster' than the cars around it.

He said he had more than 20 years' experience and was satisfied there was nothing wrong with the equipment or the reading it gave.

He told the court: 'I was on duty in uniform when I saw an Audi R8 being driven on the A303 at Cholderton.

'In my opinion, the speed was in excess of 70 miles per hour - the speed limit for that road.

'I checked the speed of the vehicle by means of a laser, approved by the Secretary of State.

'To the best of my knowledge and belief, the device was operated in accordance with the approval given.

'The speed recorded on the display meter was 129 miles per hour. I spoke to the driver who gave his name as Guy Pelly.'

He added: 'It's not an option at all that there was something wrong with the reading.

'I'm more than happy the speed I got on the device was the correct speed.'

Magistrates said they found the policeman 'credible' and were satisfied the device was working accurately.

Guidelines say justices should consider a ban for motorists caught exceeding 101 mph.

After previously been found guilty of speeding, Pelly unsuccessfully begged magistrates not to disqualify him, saying he needed to give lifts to his disabled mum.

She had her right leg amputated below the knee nine years ago following a motorbike accident in Florence, Italy.

Pelly was one of a handful of friends who joined the Princes on William's stag do at a secluded mansion in north Devon ahead of his marriage to Kate Middleton.

And he previously dated Susanna Warren, granddaughter of the Queen's former racing manager, the Earl of Carnarvon.

He opened his new Mexican-themed nightclub Tonteria in Chelsea, central London, in October.

It came after complaints from locals forced him to close his old club, Public.Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy was among the guests at the opening, as was Otis Ferry - the son of Roxy Music frontman Bryan.

Another of his former clubs, Mahiki, became one of London's trendiest night spots thanks to regular visitors Wills and Harry.

An Audi R8 V10 has a top speed of 197 mph and a 5.2 litre engine with 518 brake horsepower.

It can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 3.9 seconds, and 0 to 100 mph in just 8.7 seconds.
