Australian Rohan Dennis will attempt to claim the hour record early next year amid reports Jack Bobridge and Alex Dowsett will also launch bids.

Bobridge, the four-kilometre individual pursuit world record holder, and Dennis have track pedigree.

Both were members of Australia's team pursuit squad which finished runners-up to Great Britain at the London 2012 Olympics.

Dowsett also has a track background, but the Commonwealth Games time-trial gold medallist is not as accomplished on the boards as the Australian pair.

The 26-year-old from Essex is expected to announce his attempt in London on Friday.

Sir Bradley Wiggins has already stated the Hour is on his agenda for next June, with many predicting the six-time world track champion will set a long-lasting mark.

Austria's Matthias Brandle set the current mark, with a distance of 51.852km, in October, after cycling's world governing body, the UCI, revised regulations to make the Hour more appealing.

BMC Racing's Dennis, whose attempt will take place in Switzerland in February, said on cyclingnews.com: 'When I look at my experience on the track and the numbers I have been doing on the track and road, it's within reach.

'As long as I don't get too excited at the start and control my nerves, the pacing will take care of itself.'

Multiple world time-trial champions Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland and Germany's Tony Martin have also been linked with attempts.

Dame Sarah Storey, the 11-time Paralympic champion, will bid for the women's record in London on February 28.
