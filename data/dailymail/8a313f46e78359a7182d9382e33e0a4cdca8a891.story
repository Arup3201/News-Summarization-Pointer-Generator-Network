The father accused of killing his six children in a house fire, ‘punched the air’ in anger when he was told his ex-mistress would not be arrested over an alleged threatening phone call, a court heard today.

Michael Philpott, 56, said he would take matters into his own hands, according to a police officer who called to his house in Derby following the accusation against his former partner Lisa Willis.

Mr Philpott is on trial alongside his wife Mairead, 31, accused of attempting to frame 28-year-old Miss Willis for the fire which killed six of his children.

It is alleged that the Philpotts, 
along with a third defendant Paul Mosley, started the blaze in their 
home in Allenton, Derby which killed their children: Jade, 10, John, 
nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, Jayden, five, and Duwayne, 13.

The petrol-fuelled blaze broke out in 
the hallway of the home where Philpott lived with wife Mairead, 31, and 
their own six children – all of whom perished as they slept.

The court heard that until three 
months before the blaze last May, ‘highly controlling’ Philpott shared 
his cramped three-bedroom semi-detached home with his wife, mistress and
 all 11 children he had with both women.

Less than two weeks before the fatal 
fire, Mr Philpott reported Miss Willis to the police, accusing her of 
making a threatening phone call.

PC Sharon Atwal told Nottingham Crown Court she was
 one of the officers who went to see Mr Philpott in May after he alleged
 his former mistress had threatened him over the phone.

He told police Miss Willis had called him and said: ‘Leave me, my sister, and 
my family alone or I’ll kill you,’ the court heard.

‘Mick told me that Lisa’s family had 
never really liked him, they had never got on and they had never really 
seen eye to eye,’ PC Atwal told the court.

Prosecutor Richard Latham QC asked how
 she thought he considered the alleged call, PC Atwal said: ‘Mick said 
he did perceive it as serious and, in his words, he feared for his 
safety and his children’s safety.'

PC Atwal also said that it was clear that Philpott wanted Miss Willis taken into custody over the alleged threats.

'I took it that Mick had already made up in his mind the outcome he wanted.’

‘And that outcome was?’ Mr Latham asked.

‘Lisa being arrested.’

Jurors heard police decided no action 
would be taken against Miss Willis. When they returned to tell Philpott 
this, he reacted angrily.

‘Mick became angry, started to punch out into thin air. Created a fist and punched out into thin air,’ the officer said.

‘He said he’d take matters into his own hands.’

PC Atwal said she explained Miss 
Willis would be spoken to by officers just not under caution but 
Philpott did not accept the decision.

He left the room, after which thumping 
was heard, which PC Atwal said she believed to be a wall or a door.

Jurors were told Philpott brought some of his children into the room to talk to officers.

‘He lined them all up 
military-fashion, he directed them to sit down, and they did, then Mick 
directed them to tell the officers what they had heard,’ PC Atwal said.

She went on: ‘One of the children spoke out.

‘One of the children said ‘They said they were going to kill Daddy’.’

PC Atwal said she was not comfortable 
talking to the children because proper procedures had to be followed and
 told Philpott that officers from the child protection unit had to deal 
with them.

Duwayne Philpott, 13

Shortly after, Philpott became unwell,
 the officer said, and suffered an angina attack for which his wife had 
to bring a medicated spray.

Jurors also heard from Ian Cousins, husband of Lisa Willis’s sister Amanda, who was questioned about 
his knowledge regarding the fire.

It is alleged that Mick Philpott and 
his wife Mairead, along with a third defendant Paul Mosley, started the 
fatal blaze in order to frame Miss Willis as the culprit after she left 
her relationship with Philpott.

During Mr Cousins’ evidence to the 
court, Anthony Orchard QC, defending Mick Philpott, asked him: ‘Are you 
or were you connected to the setting of this fire?’

Mr Cousins answered: ‘Not at all.’

Mr Orchard asked: ‘Did you have any direct knowledge of who set the fire?’

‘No,’ he replied.

The court heard Philpott (second from left) planned to frame his ex-girlfriend and eventually win his children back

Opening the case for the prosecution 
last week Richard Latham QC told jurors the Philpotts lived an unusual 
life at Victory Road.

Miss Willis lived there with the 
couple as Philpott’s mistress, along with her four children that were 
fathered by him, and another child she had from a previous relationship.

Another six youngsters, those who died in the fire, were the children of Mick and Mairead Philpott and also lived in the house.

Jurors heard today from Mr Cousins 
about events before the fire in February last year when Miss Willis went
 to stay with him and his wife, from whom he is now separated, after she
 had left Philpott.

There was no love lost between Mr 
Cousins and Philpott, he said, and both he and his wife were relieved 
Miss Willis had finally decided to leave the relationship after 10 
years.

‘We knew that she had not been living in a very good situation and were just happy she had got out,’ Mr Cousins said.

Fatal: Prosecutor Mr Latham told the jury the fire was started in the early hours of the morning on the day Miss Willis and Philpott were due in court to discuss the residency of the children

Mr Cousins, who was arrested by police
 and questioned in relation to the fire before being released with no 
further action, said Philpott had turned up at his home wanting to see 
his children just weeks after Miss Willis had left.

There was a tense confrontation, jurors heard, in which Mr Cousins and Philpott exchanged insults before police were called.

The court also heard details of how 
Philpott posted an entry on Facebook in which he accused Mr Cousins of 
having an affair with Miss Willis and fathering the child she had when 
she was 16.

Mr Cousins said he and his wife both 
knew the claims were not true, but conceded that the online post had 
caused some upset between them.

The court heard that on April 6, Philpott received a call from his wife while taking friends to a darts game in his minibus.

Philpott
 told his friends: 'Sorry guys, someone is threatening to torch the 
house with the kids in it,' Mr Latham told the court.

The Philpotts and Mosley, a fork-lift truck driver and also from Derby, each deny six counts of manslaughter.

The trial continues.
