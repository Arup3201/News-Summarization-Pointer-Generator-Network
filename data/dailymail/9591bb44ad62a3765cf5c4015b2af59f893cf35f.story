The scale of customers' anger at High Street banks was revealed today as it was announced that the banks receive 10,000 complaints every day.

The number of complaints has risen by the three per cent since last year thanks to the scandal of mis-sold Payment Protection Insurance.

Barclays is the UK's most complained-about bank, with more than 250,000 new disputes recorded in the first half of this year.

Banks: The FSA reports that customers file 10,000 complaints a day

Following closely behind Barclays' 251,563 complaints were Lloyds TSB with 181,907 and Santander with 168,888, according to the Financial Services Authority.

The bank says that a large number of complaints were connected to PPI, an issue which has affected the whole sector.

According to the FSA, more than half a million complaints were received about PPI - over a quarter of the total 1,852,284 recorded bank complaints.

The insurance, which looks set to become the UK's biggest ever mis-selling scandal, covers debt repayments if the holder is unable to work due to an accident or illness, or if they lose their job.

In May, the banking industry dropped its legal challenge over whether new FSA rules on PPI mis-selling claims could be applied retrospectively.

This means more than three million people are in line for compensation, with firms facing a total bill of up to £9billion.

Only half of all complaints in the first half of 2011 were upheld.

Firms do not have to report complaints that are resolved to the customer's satisfaction by the close of business the day after the complaint was made.

High Street: Lending to small businesses has risen while it remains stable for larger companies

Despite the rise in complaints, it has also been reported that banks lent more to households and small businesses this summer.

But the Government's financial watchdog says that banks must strengthen their balance sheets to avoid damaging the economy in a future crisis.

Lenders said there was a slight increase in the availability of credit to households in the third quarter of 2011, according to a survey by the Bank of England.

Credit conditions for large and medium-sized businesses were stable, while there was a slight increase for small companies.

But banks warned 'adverse wholesale funding conditions', most likely to be caused by the eurozone debt crisis, might constrain their ability to offer loans in the future.

And small businesses are also facing tighter lending conditions in the form of covenants and collateral requirements.

Unrest in Greece: Eurozone turbulence could force banks to boost balance sheets

Financial markets have 
come under increasing strain in recent months after banks became less 
willing to lend to one another because of fears about exposure to Greek 
debt.

And the eurozone 
debt problem has created a crisis of confidence among investors, reducing
the amount of money they have pumped into financial markets.

According to the Financial Policy Committee, eurozone debt fears have also made it harder for banks to hoard cash to prepare for the shocks ahead without choking off lending to households and firms.

In its first meeting in June, the FPC said banks should build up cash levels when earnings are strong - but today admitted this may not always be possible given increasing risks to the economy.

The latest quarterly update from the FPC, set up to oversee the country's financial stability in the wake of the credit crunch, comes after the IMF warned the eurozone debt crisis had added £260billion to the risk exposure of EU banks.

But there was good news for the housing market, as the Bank of England survey revealed that demand for prime mortgages - those which are viewed by banks as relatively safe - has increased for the first time since 2009, while demand for buy-to-let mortgages also showed a 'substantial' rise.
