Hundreds of Baltimore fans have formed a queue stretching back half-a-mile to swap their Ray Rice jerseys for other stars' in reaction to footage that showed the NFL star punching his then-fiancée unconscious.

People started descending on the M&T Bank Stadium at 4am today after the club agreed to relieve fans of the #27 shirts in exchange for replica jerseys.

The event, taking place from 8am to 3pm today and tomorrow at the official team store, is a desperate bid by the NFL to claw back public respect following claims bosses turned a blind eye to Rice's domestic abuse.

Who needs an iPhone? Fans queued for hours today to swap their Ray Rice jerseys for another

Hours: Crowds descended on the M&T Bank Stadium at 4am ready for the doors to open at 8am today

The running back was dropped from the Ravens' squad last week and has been indefinitely suspended by the NFL after TMZ published CCTV footage of him punching Janay Palmer in a lift then dragging her out unconscious.

Originally, he was banned for just two games after footage emerged of the second half of the incident in February, showing Rice dragging Palmer out the elevator.

Outraged fans have now blasted bosses at the Ravens and the NFL for failing to thoroughly investigate the attack.

But today, they will be given the option to reject the disgraced star.

Swap: This fan switched his allegiance from disgraced Ray Rice to linebacker Elvis Dumervil at the exchange

Discarded: This is a pile of crumpled up Ray Rice jerseys shoved in boxes after they were returned by fans

Offer: The Ravens' bosses handed queue members tickets for an exchange, which will continue tomorrow

Bleak: There was a sullen atmosphere outside the stadium following the news of Rice's domestic abuse

Announcing the exchange this week, the squad released a series of guidelines for fans.

Jerseys must be officially licensed by the NFL, manufactured by Nike or Reebok, and purchased at the Ravens Team Store.

Exchanges are limited to one per person and each will be given a replica Nike jersey.

The move mirrors a similar one last year by the New England Patriots, which offered fans the opportunity to swap their Aaron Hernandez jerseys after he was charged with murder.

Disgraced: The Baltimore Ravens offered the exchange which will run today and tomorrow in a bid to claw back public support after the running back was filmed punching his then-fiancée unconscious in an elevator

Popular: Rice was a favourite among fans but he has now been dropped from the squad and suspended by NFL

Incident: The Ravens and the NFL were accused of failing to properly investigate Rice's abuse of Janay Palmer

Hernandez was arrested and charged with the first-degree murder of Odin Lloyd in June last year. 

Lloyd was shot to death June 17 near Hernandez' home in North Attleborough, Mass.

Since Rice's suspension, a number of other NFL players have been embroiled in abuse cases.

Adrian Peterson was indicted last week with the charge of reckless injury to a child after being accused of whipping his son with a switch.

He has now been deactivated by the Vikings indefinitely but there is as yet no news of a jersey swap.
