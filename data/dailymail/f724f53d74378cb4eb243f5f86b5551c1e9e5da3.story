It can get lonely on the windswept plains of northern Colorado and finding love can be tricky.

But as this lovestruck moose so athletically demonstrates, romance can be found anywhere if you really concentrate... especially if you put your partner on a pedestal.

The unidentified moose has shaken townsfolk in Grand Lake, Colorado, to their bones after he was caught having sex with a statue of a moose.

And the thrusting male appeared to have enjoyed himself so much that he came back the next day for another go.

As these graphic images - exposed by 9News - show, the moose at first approached the statue tentatively, even shyly.

But after some investigative sniffing and snorting, he checked that no moose were looking and mounted the mounted bronze before making love the only way he knew how.

It is unclear if his inamorata suffered any damage in the steamy session, and it has been claimed this moose was not her only horned suitor. Others have apparently tried their luck with her too, but none so tenderly as this lovestruck mammal.

The statue was erected by villagers Randy and Pam, who preferred not to reveal their surname, in the garden of their home.
