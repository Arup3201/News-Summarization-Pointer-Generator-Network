The 'world's oldest public toilet' has been discovered in Argentina - and scientists claim dinosaurs used enormous piles of faeces to scare away predators.

The 240-million-year-old 'communal latrine' contained thousands of fossilised stools, known as coprolites, from the Dinodontosaurus, one of the largest herbivores of the Triassic era and similar to modern rhinos.

It was found in the La Rioja Province in north-west Argentina and predates the former earliest megaherbivore communal latrine by 20 million years.

Prehistoric latrines: The fossilised faeces, called coprolites, were found in dense formations and have been called the world's oldest public toilet

The stools are believed to have been produced by Dinodontosaurus, one of the largest herbivores of the Triassic era and similar to modern rhinos

There are two reasons for the communal toilets - hygiene and warning potential predators to stay away, according to Scientific Reports.

Dr Lucas Fiorelli, of Crilar-Conicet, who discovered the dung heaps, told the BBC: 'Firstly, it was important to avoid parasites - "you don't poo where you eat", as the saying goes.

'But it's also a warning to predators. If you leave a huge pile, you are saying: "Hey! We are a big herd. Watch out!"'

The evidence also bolsters the hypothesis that Dinodontosaurus were sociable creatures.

An estimated 30,000 coprolites are spread across the area, with a density of up to 94 coprolites per square metre. The largest of them weigh several kilogrammes and reach lengths of up to 35cm.

The variation in size and shapes, ranging from tiny nuggets to long and thin, suggest they belong to several different herbivores of varying ages.

They are a rich store of new information about the ecology of ancient ecosystems as latrines like this are extremely rare because faeces decomposes so quickly.

Dr Fiorelli said a sheet of volcanic ash has preserved the ancient dung piles 'like Pompeii'.

Martin Hechenleitner, another author on the study, says they contain clues, on now-extinct plants, fungi, and parasites at a vital point in the history of evolution.

He said: 'This was a crucial time in evolutionary history. The first mammals were there, living alongside the grandfather of dinosaurs.

'Maybe with these fossils we can glimpse into the lost environment which gave rise to the dinosaurs.'Â
