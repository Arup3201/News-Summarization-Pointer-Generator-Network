Manchester City signed Wilfried Bony hoping he can help fire them towards Premier League and Champions League glory, but it could have turned out very differently for the striker.

The £28million January signing from Swansea has been a sensation since arriving in the Premier League in 2013, but the Ivory Coast international's career could have easily been based on preventing goals rather than scoring them.

The 26-year-old revealed in a Google chat with Manchester City supporters that he in fact used to be a defender, a centre-half no less, as he admitted that legendary Brazil striker Ronaldo was his biggest inspiration growing up.

'Ronaldo from Brazil,' Bony told fans about his childhood inspiration. 'Because I was a defender, then I loved him because he had everything. He was a complex player and I just think I wanted to be a striker and I am now, he gave me motivation to be a striker. 

As well as revealing how he changed positions in his youth, Bony also confirmed that new Manchester City and Ivory Coast team-mate Yaya Toure played a big part in helping him join the Premier League champions, and that he hopes to secure a trophy double this term.

'Always [in contact]. Even before they [City] ask for me we were in constant contact. Toure is a good guy,' Bony continued.

'We are good friends. He spoke to me a lot of the time about City. When the opportunity came to join the team he helped me. We know what we are waiting for, we want to win a trophy and win the league.

'That won't be easy because Barcelona are in good form. We need supporters to support us. We will do our best on the pitch and play to our strengths. We know the return game is back in Barca and it won’t be easy but if we are confident we can do something. 

'I want to win trophies, we need the Premier League and Champions League and it won’t be easy but we hope to win that.

'There are four or five who speak French to help me feel at home. It’s a great opportunity for me and another experience in my life. I’m happy to be here.'

Bony has yet to make his debut since joining Manchester City due to being on international duty with Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations, but at least Manuel Pellegrini knows he has a potential emergency defender in his ranks.
