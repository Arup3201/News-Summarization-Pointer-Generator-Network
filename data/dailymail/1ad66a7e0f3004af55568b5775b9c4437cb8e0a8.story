He's been searching for a 'fox in the box' since the days of Ian Wright and Thierry Henry, and Arsene Wenger thinks he might just have found one in his £16million signing Danny Welbeck.

Wenger, who also revealed his preference had been to sign Welbeck on loan from Manchester United rather than permanently, once mistakenly thought Francis Jeffers had fox-like qualities but the in-form England striker might fit the bill.

Welbeck is set to make his debut against Manchester City on Saturday, with the Arsenal manager confident he has solved his striking conundrum and given Welbeck an opportunity to finally play his club football in a central position.

ARSENAL suffered their three biggest defeats of last season in 12.45pm games on Saturdays. Will it be the same this time?

Dec 14, 2013 6-3 v Man City

Arsenal had only just returned from Italy following a 2-0 defeat at Napoli. Goals from Sergio Aguero and Alvaro Negredo put City 2-1 up at half-time, and Arsenal collapsed after the break to a Fernandinho double and goals from David Silva and Yaya Toure.

Feb 8, 2014 5-1 v Liverpool

There were no European excuses when Arsene Wenger's side went to Anfield. They had a clear week to prepare but were caught napping as Liverpool fired in four goals in the first 20 minutes. They never recovered from that blitz and Raheem Sterling completed the rout.

Mar 22, 2014 6-0 v Chelsea

A 1-0 win at Tottenham the week before ought to have given Arsenal plenty of confidence but three early goals and Kieran Gibbs's red card for handball, despite Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain committing the offence, led to another long afternoon for Wenger's men.

Wenger said: 'He's happy and confident because he scored two goals for England in a very important game (against Switzerland) and that can only boost his confidence.

'When you analyse his game, you think he has the qualities to play through the middle. At United, where you had many big stars, he had to make room for players to play through the middle. But he has the perfect style to play through the middle.'

Wenger rather cryptically claimed that nothing would have happened if he had not been on a trip to Rome. He was criticised at the time for being out of the country on September 1 as part of a trip to meet the Pope, but said the journey was important both individually and for the club.

'Meeting the Pope was an experience I did not want to miss,' said Wenger.

'I am a Catholic, so it was an experience, and one (invitation) I accepted a long time ago, and on top of that it was a game for peace and multi-religion understanding.

'I thought today where we are a bit in front of an international religious war, it was a very important game.'

Wenger hailed Pope Francis as 'a great person', who met the likes of Argentina's World Cup-winning captain Diego Maradona during the reception at the Vatican.

'He shows humility and is available to meet for everybody, has a word with everybody,' said Wenger.

'He is a supporter of San Lorenzo in Argentina. He is a football fan, you cannot be born in Argentina and not be a football fan.

'He spoke with many Argentinians, so I wanted to be discreet and say 'it was nice to meet you and bye-bye'.'

Divine intervention is one of many theories put forward for United selling an England striker to a rival, a transfer that stunned Gary Neville among others.

Wenger said his first instinct upon learning Radamel Falcao had joined United was to sign Welbeck on loan, with a view to buying him next summer. He muddied the waters by suggesting Welbeck had initially only been available on loan, but it is understood a temporary switch was his preferred option.

Wenger held off competition from Tottenham to land the 23-year-old, pulling off a coup in the wake of France striker Olivier Giroud's foot injury and Falcao's loan to United from Monaco.

Wenger conducted his business from Italy — a decision he defended by claiming the deal never would have happened if he was in London. 'If I had not travelled that day, Welbeck would not be here,' he said.

'I will tell you that story one day but that's the truth. We are in 2014 and you can always be in touch with everybody even when you travel. The advantage of that day was I had to get up at 6am and I was available the whole day.'

When asked if Sir Alex Ferguson would have sanctioned such a deal to a rival, Wenger said: 'You should ask him. I met him by coincidence on Wednesday and I would like to keep that conversation to myself!'  

Arsenal are sweating on Aaron Ramsey's fitness after he injured an ankle for Wales against Andorra. Wenger said: 'The news is not bad. He has a chance to be available.'
