Shamed: Stephen Johnson was struck off the nursing register for life

A shamed senior nurse who performed Nazi salutes in front of a Jewish colleague and groped a female co-worker has been struck off.

Stephen Johnson, 54, also sent an explicit photo to the woman at a mental health unit in Colchester, Essex.

A Nursing and Midwifery disciplinary panel was told that father-of-two Johnson - a deputy manager at the Severalls House unit - had goose-stepped around a room of patients.

He also reduced a patient, who was specifically targeted by Johnson and believed that the nurse of 28 years experience was Adolf Hitler, to tears.

Appalled former colleagues told the hearing how Johnson created a 'culture of fear' in the unit, with staff too frightened to reveal what was happening in case they lost their jobs.

Eventually two members of staff plucked up the courage to make a complaint but Johnson claimed he had been made a scapegoat by management.

But he was found guilty of serious misconduct and struck off the nursing register for life.

The panel heard how Johnson grabbed one female colleague several times, tried to kiss her and sent an explicit image to her phone.

Staff were regularly shocked by Johnson's behaviour at the rehabilitation centre for adults with serious and long term mental health illnesses.

Karen Russell, a healthcare assistant, told the panel how Johnson - who did not like anyone who was not English - encouraged a patient to goose-step and make Nazi salutes.

He told one shocked foreign nurse: "BNP, go home" and made a Nazi salute in front of a Polish colleague.

She also described how her twisted colleague would regularly fondle the genitals of a male patient.

The hearing in London also heard how he made racist comments to a Ukrainian Jewish healthcare assistant, calling him names of Arab terrorist groups.

Johnson was reported to the police after one incident where he allegedly attempted to grab the healthcare assistant's genitals but no charges were brought against him due to a lack of evidence.

The panel found him guilty of eight charges relating to the incidents which tools place between January 2008 and October 2009.

James Spencer, chairman of the disciplinary committee, said: 'Mr Johnson abused his position of power and authority with staff and patients.

'He was guilty of discrimination on racial and disability grounds.

Johnson, who had been suspended and later resigned following the allegations, was struck off in order to 'protect the public'.
