A supporter of Scottish independence who died shortly before the referendum is set to take part in the vote anyway - because his family are placing a wreath in his memory outside a polling station.

Pensioner Norman McLean was a passionate supporter of the Yes campaign, and his relatives were heartbroken when he before seeing whether his long-held ambition would come true.

So they have made a wreath saying 'Yes' which will accompany his coffin during his funeral tomorrow, and then they will place it next to a polling station on Thursday.

Memorial: This wreath is to be placed outside a polling station in memory of nationalist Norman McLean

Mr McLean, 78, from Roslin in Midlothian, died suddenly of blood poisoning last week, four years after undergoing a kidney transplant.

The widower's family knew they had to respect his wishes to participate in the independence referendum - even though are 'sympathetic' towards a No vote.

He will be buried wearing a Yes wristband, and the pro-independence wreath will be placed outside the primary school where he would have voted on referendum day.

Mr McLean's daughter, Hilary Dunn, said: 'We knew straight away that this was how he should be remembered.

'Dad was born in the north and a Scotsman through and through.

'All he talked about when I was growing up was the independence referendum. He lived for this vote and so we had to do something.

'We were just so heartbroken that he couldn't place his vote, mainly because we know he would be absolutely gutted too.'

When her father was dying, Ms Dunn reassured him that she would fight on his behalf.

'I told him that he must look down on the celebrations with pride on the 19th,' she said. 'I told him his heart will be right there with me at the polling station.

'The wreath is his way of saying Yes on Thursday. It's so significant for me because that's my dad getting his final say.

'We're going to take it to the local polling station on Thursday. George, my eldest, is going to take it down.

'He can't put pen to paper but he can be there, right there, at the polls. And he can inspire someone else to put a cross in that Yes box.'
