After last year's tragedy at the Boston Marathon, unregistered runners - called bandits - were banned from the race, but many still found a way to fake their way in - including the wife of Foursquare CEO Dennis Crowley.

Bandit running is not uncommon in marathons where entry fees can be relatively high - about $175 for the Boston race.

Instead of spending money on a genuine marathon number and having to qualify for the race, some people opt to print their own bibs, or purchase them from a third party.

Fake number: Chelsea Crowley, top, the wife of Foursquare co-founder Dennis Crowley, pictured bottom, was one of the many unregistered runners - called bandits - who participated in this year's Boston Marathon. The couple shared this photo on race day. While bandits are usually allowed at the race, they were banned this year for security reasons. Pictured above at the race on Monday

While 
bandits, those who either don't quality or can't pay to register for the
 race, are usually allowed to run in the Boston Marathon, they were 
banned this year for security reasons. Race officials addressed the 
high-demand to participate in this year's historic race however by 
increasing the running field by 9,000.

Runner 
Kathy Brown discovered that Chelsa Crowley used her number after logging
 into Marathonfoto to purchase pictures of herself at Monday's race.

She then discovered that another woman 
had run with her same number and identified her since Chelsa was wearing
 her Twitter handle right under her bib.

'I was a little dumbstruck. I didn't get it at first. I said Marathonfoto must have gotten me confused with someone else,' Brown told WCVB.

After posting a picture of herself in the bib on Twitter, another user called her out for the fake and Chelsa, a fashion writer, replied back 'shh!!'

Calling her out: A user on Twitter asked Chelsa Crowley is she ran with a fake bib and Chelsa responded with a coy 'shh!!'

But her husband, Foursquare co-founder Dennis Crowley, was more forthcoming when confronted by the local news station.

Closure: When asked by a local news station, Dennis Crowley admitted his wife ran the race with a fake bib number. He says the two ran the race together last year and wanted to run it again for 'closure'. Crowley is worth an estimated $30million. Pictured above at a charity ball in December 2012

He said that the two had run last year's race but got split up near the finish line before the bombs went off. While Crowley secured a number because he didn't finish, his wife wasn't able to get one even though she donated $5,000 to charity. Crowley is worth an estimated $30million.

Chelsa did end up running under a charity number though. Brown was one of about 25,000 runners in this year's race who earned her number by raising money for charity.

Brown had raised money to help fight multiple sclerosis, a cause close to heart since her uncle passed away from the disease.

'I put that work in it and it wasn't fair that someone else didn't have to do that. That was my first thought,' Brown said.

Crowley apologized for his wife running on the number and says they didn't mean to offend anyone.

'After running together last year, getting split up and not finishing together, we both felt like we needed to run again and finish together to get closure,' he said in a comment on WCVB's story.

He also says he sent an email to Brown, apologizing to her personally.

And Chelsa Crowley wasn't the only one running as a bandit this year.

A woman in North Carolina was shocked when she logged into the Marathonfoto site and found that four other people, two men and two women, ran under her number.

Kara Bonneau, 34, of Durham, believes posting her bib on Instagram two days before the race led to the counterfeiting. The pictured runners either made the fake bibs themselves, or purchased them from a third party.

Who are they? Bonneau posted this photo composite and comment on her Facebook page, asking for help identifying the bandits

Her number: Bonneau posted this picture of her bib on her Instagram two days before the race, and believes the bandits either copied it from there or purchased the fake number from a third party

'I feel so bad for everybody who worked really hard to get in the race and couldn't,' she told Runner's World magazine. 'It never occurred to me when I was posting that photo that someone could use it in that way. I definitely learned a lesson about posting on social media, but it's really frustrating of all the races, people would do it at this one - and in such a significant year.'

Bonneau ran in last year's race just before the bombs went off which inspired to take a second jab at the marathon. She finished this year's race in an impressive 3 1/2 hours. 

Two of the runners pictured wearing Bonneau's number were wearing shirts representing running companies, and both of those clubs have responded saying they don't know the mystery bandits.

One of the men was wearing a singlet representing Heartbreak Hill Running Company in Newton, Mass and the company said on Facebook that while they appreciate his state in shirts, they 'do not appreciate the fact that he ran the race as a bandit with a forged bib.

Heartbreak Hill co-owner Dan Fitzgerald says he does not know the man.

Another woman was pictured wearing a singlet for Big River Running co.

'We do not recognize her and are appalled she chose to wear one of our singlets while wearing a counterfeit bib,' the company wrote on Fracebook. 'The Big River community is one built on integrity and respect for one another, and these actions donâ€™t reflect what our logo truly represents.'

Second time around: Bonneau ran the Boston Marathon last year and finished just before the bombs went off. The tragedy inspired her to tackle the race again in 2014. Pictured above completing this year's race
