At last a comprehensively good day for David Moyes. A come-from-behind victory — a rare thing indeed in this troubled season — and a pre-match show of bravado clever enough to earn  some new respect from the Stretford End.

Moyes has at times shown himself a little awed by his first season at  Manchester United. Not on this occasion, though.

The United manager’s pre-match walk down the touchline ahead of his team’s emergence from the tunnel could have backfired dreadfully.

One-nil! David Moyes won a personal victory after receiving support from United fans at Old Trafford

Respite: Wayne Rooney (L) and a first goal from Juan Mata helped United to a 4-1 victory over Aston Villa

Damp squib: A fly-by protest calling for Moyes to be sacked was largely met with derision at Old Trafford

Moyes, though, had judged the mood of his crowd better than the media and certainly better than the classless goons who dug in to their pockets to hire a plane trailing a  banner denigrating their manager above the stadium at kick-off.

The Stretford End’s applause was generous and genuine. They respect a bit of ‘front’ in Manchester. They got used to it during 27 years of Sir Alex Ferguson and here was a bit of Glaswegian gallus from their new man.

Sign of the times: Calls to remove Moyes' The Chosen One banner were also ignored

Teenage kicks: Adnan Januzaj came on to unlock Aston Villa's defence with a through ball for the final goal

David Moyes is yet to name the same starting XI in two competitive games. This was his 47th different starting team.

It made for superb theatre and United’s subsequent victory would have pleased Moyes, too. Trailing early, they could have capitulated, given their recent dismal efforts at home. Here, though, despite some more suspect defending, United muddled through.

A 4-1 scoreline perhaps flattered them a little. Bayern Munich won’t be too worried ahead of tomorrow’s Champions League quarter-final game at Old Trafford but United left back Alex Buttner at least struck a positive tone.

‘If we lose a game we shouldn’t be looking at the manager, it is the team,’ said Buttner. ‘Today we fought for each other, the fans and for the gaffer. We have a very important game on Tuesday and it was great for our confidence that we beat Villa. If we had lost the confidence would have been low but now we have a good feeling.’

German engineering: United will be more severely tested when they face Bayern in the Champions League

Dutch courage: Alex Buttner (L) will line up to play against Bayern in the absence of Patrice Evra

With Patrice Evra suspended for the game, Buttner will start against the Bundesliga champions. This is where the bad news starts.

Moyes’ team can score goals — they created some good ones on Saturday — but they look vulnerable through the centre of the defence and Bayern wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery will certainly be enthusiastic about getting at Buttner and the Brazilian Rafael, if he recovers from the thigh injury that forced him off at half-time on Saturday.

United remain short of numbers at the back and the timing couldn’t be worse. Michael Carrick, supposed to be resting ahead of tomorrow, was forced on as an emergency central defender at half-time against Villa as Phil Jones shuffled across to replace Rafael.

Injury blow: United defender Rafael (R) could also miss the game after being taken off with a knock

Be afraid! Bayern Munich have already sewn up the Bundesliga with seven league games to go

Leading 2-1 at the time, United should have been pegged back on two occasions, Christian Benteke wasting both opportunities, and this is what will worry Moyes more than anything ahead of a two-legged tie against a team that has won 27 of its last 30 games.

‘I’ve never played against Robben before and I haven’t watched videos or anything like that to study him but I know enough from what I have seen to know how he plays the game,’ added Buttner.

‘This kind of big game is why you play football. It is what it is all about. It would be good for my career if I could do well against him.’

Whatever happens tomorrow,  Buttner’s career at United will end this summer. The Dutch defender is sadly not quite good enough.

Clearout: Buttner is unlikely to remain at Old Trafford beyond this season as United begin plans for rebuilding

Headstrong! Christian Benteke missed several chances against United... the Germans will not be so profligate

Good luck with that! Paul Lambert (R) has warned United that they will not have much possession against Bayern

For Moyes, however, the next 10 days or so will be critical. Nobody expects United to get past the defending champions and, remarkable as it sounds, defeat with honour would be acceptable. Another pounding, though, may still prove fatal for the United manager.

On Saturday Bayern’s scouts will have seen a typically determined performance from Wayne Rooney and some improvement from Juan Mata and Shinji Kagawa.

Villa manager Paul Lambert, once a Bundesliga player, struck a salutary note, though. ‘United are going to be without the ball for a long time, that’s a big thing,’ he said. ‘It’s going to be really tough. You wouldn’t back against United but they are going to have to play — over two legs — one of the best teams in Europe.’
