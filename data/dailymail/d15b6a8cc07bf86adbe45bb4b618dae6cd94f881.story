Chelsea striker Diego Costa has been passed fit to play against Everton on Saturday.

The £32million signing from Atletico Madrid was a doubt after sustaining a hamstring injury in training earlier this week.

Boost: Diego Costa has been passed fit to face Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday

He hasn't trained at the club's Cobham HQ over the last few days - but came through Friday's session unscathed and will travel to Goodison Park.

It had been feared that Costa, who has scored in two in two games for Chelsea so far, could miss six weeks.

But those fears have now been allayed, with the Spaniard due to battle it out with Didier Drogba for a starting role against the Toffees.  

Celebration: Costa scored against Burnley and Leicester as he got his Chelsea career off to a perfect start

Thankful: Jose Mourinho must now turn to Fernando Torres and Didier Drogba as his back-up strikers
