Sex attacker: An artist's impression of the man who struck in Dunstable, Bedfordshire

This is the face of a sex attacker who climbed into a woman's car and forced her to drive to a secluded location where he assaulted her at knifepoint.

Police have put together an artist's impression of the man - who is described as white with an olive complexion - after he struck at a shell petrol station in Dunstable, Bedfordshire.

The victim, who is in her late 20s, was leaving the garage in Poynters Road in the evening of February 21 when the attacker opened the passenger door of her dark grey 4x4 and got in.

He produced a knife and forced her to drive to a nearby road where he subjected her to a 15-minute attack.

The victim sounded the horn and managed to 
switch on the internal light during the attack. She suffered injuries to
her head and hands as she fought back.

Police have also released a CCTV 
image of a man seen getting into a car at the petrol station.

The man spoke with a foreign accent, 
possibly Italian. He was around 5ft10in to 6ft tall and of slim to 
medium build, with short stubble on his face.

He was wearing dark trousers which had
a logo on them or fluorescent markings. He was also wearing a dark 
hooded jacket with the hood up and pulled tight round his face.

A reconstruction of the attack was shown on BBC's Crimewatch on Thursday night.

Detective Chief Inspector Ruth Dodsworth said: 'As a result 
of the programme we have now received several new lines of 
investigation, but I would still continue to appeal to anyone who has 
information relating to the condom to come forward and speak with 
officers.'

The man had an unusual make of condom - called Star'tex - which he left in the victim's car after he fled. 

The condom, which is not sold in the UK, came from a batch sold in Belgium in December last year.
