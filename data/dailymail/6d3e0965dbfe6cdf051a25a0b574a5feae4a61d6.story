A husband has been found guilty of murdering his estranged wife following the collapse of their 27-year marriage.

Christopher Parry, 50, gunned down Caroline, 46, in a quiet suburban street in south Wales last year.

Weeks before, Mrs Parry had moved out of the marital home, fed up with her husband’s controlling and domineering ways.

Newport Crown Court heard jealous Parry turned up at her new address unannounced – armed with a semi-automatic gun containing three bullets.

Face of a murderer: Christopher Parry, 49, shot himself in the face in a suicide attempt after he killed his wife

After shooting her twice in the back, he turned the gun on himself and unleashed a shot into his face at point -blank range.

Parry, who has permanent facial disfigurement from the botched suicide attempt, admitted causing the death of his wife, but denied murder.

However, a jury cast aside claims the depressed defendant was not in control of his actions - and ruled the killing was intentional.

The shooting took place in Seabreeze Avenue, Newport, South Wales, on August 8.

Mrs Parry had been living in the newly-built red-brick estate after moving out of the home she shared with her husband six miles away in Croesyceiliog, near Cwmbran.

But despite being told on April 12 their relationship was over, Parry refused to accept this - and was convinced she still had feelings for him.

A jury heard the defendant kept his wife ‘under surveillance’ and was described by prosecuting counsel Michael Mather-Lees QC as a man ‘not prepared to let go’.

In the weeks leading up to tragedy, he repeatedly texted, phoned and followed his wife.

The day prior to the shooting, licensed gun-holder Parry booked two days off work.

And on that fateful day, Mrs Parry was leaving for work when something caused her to stop and open the boot of her red Toyota car.

It was then her estranged husband got out of his Ford Focus and retrieved his firearm from the back of his vehicle.

After pulling the trigger three times, neighbours found the couple’s bloodied bodies lying side-by-side on the road.

Mrs Parry was pronounced dead at the Royal Gwent Hospital.

After the jury delivered a 10 to 1 majority verdict, there were cries of ‘yes’ from relatives of the late Mrs Parry in the public gallery.

Judge Mr Justice Williams said he will sentence the defendant on Friday.
