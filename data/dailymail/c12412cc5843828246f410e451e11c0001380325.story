Death rates rose by almost a third in England and Wales last month – driven by a fatal combination of vaccine-resistant flu and the cold snap, figures reveal.

Almost 29,000 people died in the fortnight before January 23 – about 7,000 above the five-year average.

Most of those who perished were elderly and many fell victim to a strain of flu which has mutated more than usual this winter.

The latest death rates, published by the Office for National Statistics reveal in the two weeks ending January 23, 28,800 deaths were registered - up 32 per cent from the average for this time of year, calculated over the last five years, is 21,859 deaths 

As a result, fewer people who had vaccinations were protected from the most common form of the virus – H3N2.

Early estimates show one in five people who developed flu in January fell ill despite having had the jab.

Doctors say problems arise because the vaccine is prepared about eight months before the flu season starts in November and is designed to tackle strains likely to be the most dominant.

But this year the H3N2 strain had already mutated by the time the critical flu period arrived. 

Professor John Newton of Public Health England told the BBC: ‘There can be mutation so that the circulating type [of flu] might not be as well matched at the end of the flu season as it was at the beginning.’

Dr Richard Pebody, head of seasonal flu surveillance at the authority, added: ‘In recent weeks we have seen evidence of significant excess mortality, particularly in the elderly, with more deaths than expected at this time of the year.

‘Two important causes of excess deaths during the winter are influenza and cold snaps, although estimating exactly how much can be attributed to each takes more time.

Experts say the cold snap is one of the reasons behind the unusually high death rates

‘The main type of flu that has been circulating this winter so far – influenza H3N2 – is well recognised to particularly impact groups such as the elderly and those with underlying chronic health problems, resulting in increases in hospitalisations and deaths. That is why we recommend these groups receive flu vaccine each year ideally before the flu season starts.’

More than 72 per cent of people aged over 65 have received a flu jab this winter, a similar level to previous years.

Although the vaccination programme identified the right type of flu, it could not guarantee protection from a changing virus. Public Health England carried out a study last year which found that one in five patients with flu had the mutated strain, against which the jab would be ineffective.

However tests were based on a small sample of 24 patients, five of whom were found to have the mutated strain. Other experts say the true numbers could be higher. Researchers at PHE have since carried out a larger study and the findings are due to be published later this week.

In the US, which has also been badly hit by flu this winter, as many as half of all cases of the virus are mutations and several patients have died despite being vaccinated.

The H3N2 strain of flu, circulating this year, is also particularly virulent in the elderly and those with existing health conditions causing a rise in hospitalisations and deaths

Last month specialists at Southampton General Hospital blamed the mutation on a doubling in the number of patients with serious chest infections to about 50 a day.

The Office for National Statistics, which published the latest figures yesterday, said mortality rates had already been running close to the five-year average at the end of 2014.

By the first week of January the number of deaths was up by 3,960 on last year. There were 3,721 more in the second week and an extra 3,220 the week after – bringing total excess deaths to 11,340 over the three weeks.

More than three quarters of deaths were among those over 75. Dr Pebody added: ‘We offer advice throughout the winter to health professionals and the public about staying safe and healthy in cold weather – which includes looking out for older people who may be more at risk from the effects of very cold weather.’
