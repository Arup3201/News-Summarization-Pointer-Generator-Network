Clothes shopping has never been anything but a chore for me. Ever since I can remember, I have been the wrong size. Even when I was 16 or 17 and at my slimmest, the High Street made me feel like a big fat freak.

The only way to fit into the kind of clothes that were affordable and accessible, it seemed to me, was to eat next to nothing and exercise away every last calorie.

But even then I never managed to get below a Miss Selfridge size 10-12. I’ve never been skinny enough for fashion. So, when High Street chain Mango announced, with great fanfare, that they were rolling out a plus-size range, I wasn’t particularly surprised when it turned out that their definition of ‘plus’ was a size 12.

Perhaps it might be in other far-flung countries where retailers outsource their manufacturing to, but in the UK a size 12 is definitely not plus.

You can’t blame it all on Mango. The truth is that fashion has never loved women’s bodies. From safety-pin dresses to hot pants, 95 per cent of fashion is designed to suit approximately 20 per cent of the population.

But those of us who don’t conform to the fashion world’s minute proportions still have to buy clothes. So, how can women who are a little on the generous side go shopping without having a nervous breakdown?

After decades of trying-on, many tears, and the odd triumph, here is my guide to conquering the High Street — and my pick of the best outfits big girls can buy today.

The first step is acceptance. For years, I used to go shopping hoping in vain that somehow, overnight, I might have dropped a dress size.

This never happens. And so, my first rule is this: always take a size bigger than you need into the changing room. There is nothing more demoralising than having to ask the attendant for a larger size. Asking for a size down, however, is FANTASTIC.

Better still is popping out of the changing room, doing a quick twirl — and hearing her opine that something is too big. ‘Do you really think so?’ you can say, all wide-eyed and innocent, while internally punching the air with sheer unadulterated joy.

The second rule is this: make an effort. You are going to have to take your clothes off, and if you’re faced with the same pair of baggy grey pants and ineffective bra every time you strip down, you are going to hate yourself.

Wear your best bra, decent heels and a slip — something confidence-boosting that will also protect your modesty — and a bit of make-up.

It’s not a fashion show, I know, but it’s all about confidence.

One of the difficulties of being plus size is that you can be so grateful if something — anything — fits, you end up buying all kinds of hideous rubbish.

So remember: you don’t HAVE to buy anything, even if you are shopping for a special occasion.

There’s always bound to be something tried and tested at home you can spruce up.

Know your limitations. I know that if I’m in tears, it’s time to stop, have a cup of tea (or hell, perhaps something stronger) and then head to the accessories department. A scarf, a pair of earrings, new shoes — all are as good as a new outfit.

If it’s been a particularly demoralising trip, I sometimes end up with a new handbag. I have a lot of bags.

Wherever possible, shop alone. You might think it will be more fun with a friend, but whenever I shop with a pal, I just end up picking things out for her. That’s because most of my friends are slimmer than me, and therefore much easier to dress.

Shopping with my mother, who is a size 8 and essentially a different species, is a disaster. If you’ve ever watched Miranda, you’ll get the picture.

If things get really tough, there’s always the internet. People bemoan the demise of the British High Street; I say it deserves everything it gets. All those tiny changing rooms and bitchy sales assistants.

The internet is the fat girl’s revenge. You can order your clothes and try them in the privacy of your bedroom — with no one but the dog to witness your upper arm shame.

M&S’s changing rooms are possibly the least pleasant in the shopping universe. As for its underwear, there is too much choice. It’s confusing, and their sizing is sporadic.

Fenwick is like Rigby & Peller (where the Queen buys her bras), only not as eye-wateringly expensive or quite so majestic. It has a great mix of everyday and fancy bras, including those by Wacoal, which are pretty and supportive of even the most impressive bust.

For tights and hosiery, go to John Lewis for its own brand, which goes up to an XXL, and Pretty Polly’s Curves range. Try House of Fraser, too — Wolford’s Synergy Push Up Tights can work wonders.

Debenhams is always a bit of a bun fight, but has a very good selection of shapewear. Best of all, though, is Bravissimo, which has stores across the country.  

BUSINESS MEETINGDress, £59, Mary Portas at House of Fraser. Jacket, £35, Collection at M&S. Heels, £40, NextA real surprise. I look a tiny bit mother-of-the-bride, but the structure of the jacket is great, and it balances out my shape nicely.      SCORE: 8/10

Mary Portas for House Of Fraser can be a bit hit and miss, but when she gets it right, she really gets it right. This is mainly because her stuff always has decent length.

Good old M&S can be great — although it does vary between their own labels. Autograph does wonderful casual-chic separates, and Per Una is well cut.

John Lewis also stocks a great selection of brands that are kind to the midriff and thigh. Fenn Wright Manson and Hobbs are always good and Farhi by Nicole Farhi is expensive but will make you look and feel both rich and thin.

For dresses, Eve Pollard (mother of Claudia Winkleman and Fleet Street veteran) has devised her own range designed for ‘grown-up women’. The reversible ones are especially useful (grayandosbourn.co.uk). They wash well, and are great on their own or with layering.

One of the problems with most evening wear is that it’s often strapless or sleeveless, which means you end up faffing around with wraps and/or bolero jackets, which are loathsome. Nothing screams ‘I’m hiding my bingo wings’ more than a bolero jacket. If money is no object, head straight to Anna Scholz, whose clever, on-trend designs have never failed me.

Damsel In A Dress, which you can find at John Lewis, does amazing draped jersey dresses, which add a Jessica Rabbit edge to your extra inches. And Phase Eight and Coast are both brilliant at dressing curves.

Rather more unexpected is Barbara Hulanicki for George at Asda. This is a poor woman’s Biba — albeit, in my view, infinitely more wearable than the new Biba range, which only seems to want to cater for women without hips.

I bought a chiffon and lace shirt for £18 there recently, wore it to a lavish political fundraiser with palazzo pants and heels — and two people complimented me on it. In a room full of Prada! Choose carefully, and you can bag treasures at supermarket prices.
