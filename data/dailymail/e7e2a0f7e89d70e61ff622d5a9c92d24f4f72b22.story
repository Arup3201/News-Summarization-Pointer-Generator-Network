Chelsea quartet John Terry, Gary Cahill, Eden Hazard and Cesc Fabregas all feature in EA Sports' team of the season so far, but there is no place for the Blues' star striker Diego Costa.

The XI calculated by the EA Sports Player Performance Index ranks players on goals scored, assists, clean sheets, time on the pitch, and actions that contribute to victories and points won when in the side.

Cahill and Terry have been Jose Mourinho's main central defensive pairing this season as the west London club sit top of the table, having conceded just 14 goals so far.

(4-4-2): David de Gea; Nathaniel Clyne, Gary Cahill, John Terry, Aaron Cresswell; Eden Hazard, Cesc Fabregas, Yaya Toure, Santi Cazorla; Alexis Sanchez, Sergio Aguero

In defence they are joined by full backs Nathaniel Clyne and Aaron Cresswell. Southampton's Clyne has prodcued the most tackles so far this season with 78, while Cresswell has played a pivotal role in West Ham's sixth-place position so far.

David de Gea is the only Manchester United player to feature in the starting XI. The Spain keeper has been the Red Devils' stand out performer in goal this season and that is reflected by the fact he has the joint-second best save to shot ratio percentage in the league (75). De Gea is equalled in this stat by Swansea's Lukasz Fabianski and only bettered by Sunderland's Costel Pantillimon.

In midfield, Fabregas makes the team of the season. He has completed the most passes (1563) and created the most chances (61) than any other player in the league after 19 games. In addition, the former Arsenal and Barcelona star has run 132.4miles  - a figure that only Stoke's Steven Nzonzi has beaten (133.4miles).

Manchester City talisman Yaya Toure also makes EA Sports' team of the week after an impressive game

Despite a slow start to the season Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure joins the duo in midfield - alongside Arsenal's Santi Cazorla, who performed well against West Ham.

Cazorla's  team-mate Alexis Sanchez fills one of the striking berths up front after netting 11 goals in 17 games so far this season. The Chile forward is second to Hazard in dribbles completed (61) and third to Fabregas in chances created (51).

City's deadly striker Sergio Aguero completes the line-up. The Argentina striker has had the most shots on target (34) than any other player - with 14 of those strikes converted into goals, despite having missed chunks of the season through injury.
