Carlo Ancelotti is sure to have upset many Premier League managers after insisting Sami Khedira and Angel Di Maria won't be leaving Real Madrid this summer.

Arsenal and Chelsea have been leading the chase for Khedira, while Di Maria was seen as a big-name signing Louis van Gaal was craving at Manchester United.

But Ancelotti says the duo will be in his squad for the coming season, while also admitting a move for Falcao, or any other player, is off the table.

Arsenal target: But the Italian boss has also quashed reports that Sami Khedira will be allowed to leave

The Italian claims Khedira and Di Maria haven't played during pre-season because of fitness issues after a strenuous World Cup. 

'Nothing has changed,' the Italian told reporters. 'They're Real Madrid players.

'I just chose other players for the European Super Cup. Only [Khedira's Germany colleague Toni] Kroos played from among those who arrived back on August 5.'

'It's done,' the former AC Milan and Chelsea boss stated. 'We're not looking to make any more signings.'

Real Madrid  ominous form ahead of the new La Liga season faded somewhat in their 2-1 loss to Fiorentina on Saturday night at the Bernabeu.
