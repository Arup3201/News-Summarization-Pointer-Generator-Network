It is the castle home that has become the very English setting of etiquette lessons.

Wiverton Hall, built out of the remains of a 15th century fortified castle which was largely destroyed during the Civil War, has been offered for sale for £1.5 million. 

The gate house and guard room from the original property remain intact and their majestic stone arches make up the current dining room of the six-bedroom property which was renovated by the Chaworth family in the 19th century and has remained in their family for several hundred years.

The property, which is 11 miles east of Nottingham, currently has a tenant  who has taught Western etiquette to the Chinese from the residence and is said to be in the process of moving out.

In addition to the four reception rooms and four bathrooms, the property offers potential owners stunning views over the Vale of Belvoir. A particular historical feature in the residence is an enclosed stone and turreted spiral staircase, which leads from the ground floor to the roof.

The Grade II listed property has been sympathetically restored with a double aga in the kitchen and a vast stone fire place in the sitting room.

Included in the properties 10,000 sq ft are the former servants quarters on the second floor which is yet to be refurbished and which estate agents say could provide space for even more bedrooms.

The master bedroom is on the first floor and features French doors which lead to a leaded balcony over the front porch cochere and en-suite bathroom. Two other bedrooms also feature en-suites. 

Steve Parker, the estate agent handling the sale for FHP Living, said: 'This is an incredible place.'It has been used as a family home for the last ten years and growing up there must have been fantastic'

The history of the property is well documented in Pevsner Buildings of England; it describes it as: '1814 symmetrical, castellated and stuccoed. Of five bays and two storeys with turrets flanking the central feature of porte-cochere and large gothic window, and marking each end of the facade'

Wiverton Hall is set in its own extensive 1.2 hectare grounds and is surrounded by generous lawned areas, mature shrubbery and trees and a woodland area.

Steve Parker, the estate agent handling the sale for FHP Living, said: 'This is an incredible place.

'It has been used as a family home for the last ten years and growing up there must have been fantastic.

'The views across the Vale of Belvoir are stunning and the house itself has three acres for the owners to enjoy.'

Mr Parker said the property had 'great access' to nearby market towns of Bingham and Newark and a 'lot of interest' had already been shown in it.
