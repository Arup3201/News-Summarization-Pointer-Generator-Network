More and more players seem to be swapping shirts early at half time, but Iran captain Javad Nekounam got a step ahead of his team-mates: by appearing to ask Lionel Messi for his shirt at the traditional pre-match handshake.

The 33-year-old Kuwait midfielder saw the opportunity to get hold of one of the most in demand shirts of the World Cup and looks to have popped the question to the Argentine superstar minutes before kick off in Belo Horizonte.

A number of players have been spotted swapping shirts at half time in Brazil - but Nekounam set a new record by potentially nabbing Messi's shirt after the coin toss in what will most likely be Iran's biggest game of the World Cup.

In Croatia's Wednesday night 4-0 win over Cameroon, players were even spotted swapping shorts, a tactic yet to be adopted by any Iranian players.

And if Nekounam's move was a distraction technique against the four-time Ballon d'Or winner - his mind games seemed to be working well, so far, with Iran holding the Argentines at 0-0 at half time.

But the Barcelona forward finally managed to win the game for Argentina, grabbing a 90th minute winner to break Iran hearts.
