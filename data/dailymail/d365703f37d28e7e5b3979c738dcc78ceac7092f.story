Twin brothers who suffered a rare condition which meant they shared the same placenta and blood supply, were saved when doctors performed laser surgery in the womb.

Nathaniel and Joshua Cavalier had a condition known as twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, which resulted in an unequal flow of blood from their mother Verena's placenta.

The condition - which can be fatal - was diagnosed when their mother went for a 21-week scan at Southend Hospital.

The 32-year-old, from Rayleigh in Essex, was rushed to London's King's College Hospital where she underwent pioneering laser surgery the same day.

Verena Cavalier's twin boys Nathaniel and Joshua were born in February after doctors performed life-saving laser surgery on the boys while they were still in the womb

A critical operation - with just a 33 per cent chance of both the twins surviving - was carried out in December.

Doctors inserted a camera and fibre optic laser down a tiny endoscope into Verena's womb.

The laser then sealed off some of the shared blood vessels to ensure the boys received a more equal supply of blood.

The operation was a resounding success and the boys were born on February 12 by Caesarian section at Southend Hospital.

Nathaniel weighed 3.12lbs and his brother Joshua weighed in at just 3.1lbs.

But if the brothers' start in life was not enough, they have also had to fight blood poisoning and meningitis since their birth.

This week Mrs Cavalier and her husband Paul, 41, celebrated their sons' four-month 'birthday'.

Language teacher Mrs Cavalier, said they feel very lucky their boys survived.

She said: 'I was very lucky because the condition can develop very rapidly and I wasn't due another scan for a week, but my consultant said she would do it early as she was going on holiday.'

Doctors at King's College Hospital did an ultrasound to confirm the condition.

And just an an hour later Professor Kypros Nicolaides performed the surgery.

But because events had moved so quickly, Mrs Cavalier only just had time to call her husband to let him know she was being operated on.

She said: 'One minute I was at Southend Hospital and the next I was on the train.

Joshua (pictured) and his brother Nathaniel, have also fought blood poisoning and meningitis since they were born on February 12. They were diagnosed with the rare condition twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome when their mother had a 21-week scan at Southend Hospital

'My husband was at work so I had to make the decisions myself. He got there just as they started the surgery.

'It was an awful decision to have to make, but there was no time to lose. The longer we waited, the higher the chance the babies could die or be brain damaged.'

The crucial operation was carried out under a local anaesthetic meaning the expectant mother was fully aware of what was happening to her and her babies.

She said: 'They had a camera attached to the laser with a monitor nearby.

'I could see what they were doing. I could see a little hand moving about and I prayed the babies wouldn't move and get caught by the laser.

'It took 45 minutes and then I was sent to recover in a quiet room. Another scan showed the babies were both well and I was allowed to go home.'

Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome occurs in twins who share a placenta,
 when there is an unequal flow of blood between the two babies.

Too much blood in one twin will put a strain on his heart and cause him to produce more urine to get rid of the excess fluid.

The other twin will not grow as well and may have little or no amniotic fluid around him.

The condition can be serious if it is left untreated.

It is rectified using a harmless laser beam, which seals off some of 
the blood vessels between babies and makes the blood flow more equal.

Despite its success, the couple were left on tenterhooks knowing that the odds were against both boys surviving.

Mrs Cavalier, a German and Latin teacher, then had to face a 20 per cent chance of a miscarriage during the following six weeks.

She said: 'I had two miscarriages before, so I was convinced I would lose them.

'I went back to work because I didn't want to sit at home and panic.'

At 29 weeks her waters broke but she did not go into labour for another two weeks, giving the twins 'vital extra time'.

She was also given cortisone in that time to help the babies' lungs develop.

Both had to overcome a potentially fatal infection of the stomach and blood poisoning but survived.

They then went home on March 9 but had to return to Southend Hospital after catching bacterial meningitis.

However, the boys came through once again and now weigh in at 8.3lbs and 6.10lbs respectively - the size that many babies are actually born at.

Mrs Cavalier, who also has a daughter, two-year-old Magdalena, added: 'We owe Professor Nicolaides so much. Without him, we wouldn't have our boys. We would have lost them.

'We are really grateful to Southend Hospital neonatal unit as well. They were all wonderful there.

'The boys are four months old now. People ask me how old they are and are very surprised when I tell them.'

Professor Nicolaides added: 'The boys were delivered by emergency caesarean section and were quite poorly after they were born.

'I am so pleased they are now both healthy and happy and their parents can enjoy watching them grow up.'
