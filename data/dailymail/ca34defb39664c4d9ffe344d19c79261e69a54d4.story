Influence: Former Chelsea striker Didier Drogba pictured with Marina Granovskaia who has become the latest member of Chelsea's executive board

Roman Abramovich's right-hand woman today became the only ever female to be appointed to Chelsea's executive board.

Marina Granovskaia took up the influential role today after years of being a key player behind the scenes.

Granovskaia is now in the top five of a small select group of women who hold powerful positions within the world of football - joining the likes of Karren Brady and Carolyn Radford.

Her role at the club has been expanding in recent years and she has been attending board meetings in an unofficial capacity since 2010, as well as acting as a transfer broker.

She has also been spotted at the training ground and speaks to senior players to canvass their opinion on key issues.

Her appointment to the Chelsea board will not change the way things operate at Stamford Bridge, merely formalise the structure.

Granovskaia has been playing a de facto chief of staff role to Abramovich across many of his business interests. She was once described as arguably the most powerful presence at the club.

The Russian-Canadian has been employed by Abramovich for 17 years, and will now become one of the most highly-placed women working in English football.

She started out working for his Sibneft oil company after graduating from Moscow State University in 1997 and will now join chairman Bruce Buck, CEO Ron Gourlay, and director Eugene Tenenbaum.

Granovskaia's appointment to the board 
has long been in the pipeline and has not occurred sooner because of the
arrival of the new Chelsea manager.

She was involved in the deals to bring David Luiz and Fernando Torres to the club in January 2011.

Along with Tenenbaum, another Russian-Canadian, Granovskaia has the speediest access to Abramovich. 

This means that when Abramovich is not easy to contact for other board members - i.e. when away on other business -  she will still be able to pass on messages from them.

Marina Granovskaia today joins the minuscule number of women holding powerful positions within the world of football, including:

Karren Brady

West
Ham's vice-chairman has been labelled 'the First Lady of football'. She
was previously managing director at Birmingham City. While at West Ham 
she has helped oversee the club's upcoming move to the Olympic Stadium.

Margaret Byrne

Sunderland
appointed Margaret Byrne as their chief executive in 2011 after a 
boardroom shake up. The former solicitor has laso been voted on to the 
FA Council. 

Carolyn Radford

Mansfield
Chief executive Caroyln Radford became the youngest woman ever to 
become CEO of a football club in 2011. At the time she was Carolyn 
Still, but married club chairman John Radford.
