A U.S. company has partnered with Queensland researchers in the hope of producing human kidneys on 3D printers.

Last year the research team at the University of Queensland, led by Professor Melissa Little, were able to grow a tiny kidney, just two millimetres long, in a laboratory dish.

The San Diego based bio-printing company, Organovo have signed an agreement with the University of Queensland's company UniQuest to see how far they might be able to push the research, in the hope that eventually they will be able to bio-print kidneys.

Bio-printing, the 3D printing of body parts, has been occurring for years. There has been success in printing skin, blood vessel, the cartilage of the ear, and some success with more complex parts such as the bladder and uterus.

Bio-printing kidneys could increase the number of organs available for people needing transplants and greatly improve the chances of transplant success.

However, the dream of bio-printing a kidney is still 15 to 20 years away, estimates Professor Little because the kidney is such a complex organ.

'Bio-engineering a kidney is probably the most difficult thing you could try and build,' she said.

'The kidney is a large organ with 35 different cell types that all have different functions, and a whole lot of little tubules that have to be lined up the right way, making it a much more complex organ than the liver, the pancreas or the heart.'

Organova's ultimate goal might be to print a kidney, but their initial goal is to reproduce tiny kidneys in laboratory settings, as Professor Little's team have already done, which can be used for drugs testing.

They might help test cures for renal diseases caused by genetic conditions and also speed up the process of producing pharmaceuticals.

'Most drugs that are developed fail, because they are harmful either to the heart or to the kidney. So if you could find out very early that the drugs you're producing would hurt the kidney you wouldn't waste your time developing it,' said Professor Little.

It is hoped that eventually 3D printers, such as this one producing a likeness of Bruce Willis, might be able to make organs
