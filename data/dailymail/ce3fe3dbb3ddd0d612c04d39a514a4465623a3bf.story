Tensed, taut and coated in bronzing tan, these are the female bodybuilders leading the way in a sport that's becoming increasingly popular with women.

The colossally-built, bikini-clad contestants were taking part in a world event held in honour of former Mr Olympia Arnold Schwarzenegger.

The actor and ex-Governor of California watched from the sidelines as the ripped women competitors paraded around the stage in their bid to win the Arnold Classic Australia.

The event, held at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre today, also saw the sport's top male competitors battle it out to win the men's crown.

The female competition was split between the figure division and bikini division - although both required participants to don swimwear which left little space for wardrobe malfunctions.

After strutting along the stage, each of the bodybuilders flexed their gargantuan muscles honed to perfection after moths of tireless training.

Schwarzenegger was seen clapping and cheering as the sportsmen and women stood in an array of poses - ensuring the judges got a view of every angle of their jaw-dropping bodies.

Other highlights at the annual event include Australia’s Strongest man, Arnold Weightlifting & Powerlifting and Arnold Armwrestling.

During an interview with radio station KIIS 1065 Schwarzenegger said: 'It’s great to be back here [in Australia]. I said I would be back... The Terminator always keeps his promise.'

The 67-year-old former professional body-builder, won the title of Mr. Olympia seven times, presented the winners with their trophies.
