The boss of one of Britain's 'Big Six' energy firms has been accused of using company money to finance his stand-up comedian wife.

EDF Group chief executive Henri Proglio faces an investigation in his native France into whether he funnelled money from the state-owned utility to his actress and comedian wife, Rachida Khalil, or influenced others to do so.

The 64-year-old energy chief, whose firm has been accused of 'naked greed' for not passing on falling prices to customers, is under the spotlight over the finances of his wife, 24 years his junior.

But he has denied using EDF money to fund his Moroccan born wife, whom he married last year, saying by way of explanation: 'She is an artist and her accounting is a bit artistic, too.'

EDF Group boss Henri Proglio, 64, is under investigation over whether funds from his company and associated firms were paid to his new wife, stand-up comedian and actress, Rachida Khalil, 40

Investigators in Paris, who were reportedly tipped off by anti-corruption officials at several banks, are said to be looking at how Ms Khalil managed to earn nearly 1.8million Euros (£1.45m) in a year.  The sum is said to include 100,000 Euros in cash.

An article in French news magazine, Le Point, claimed that Mr Proglio's wife received money from EDF's charitable foundation, while some funds were also transferred from contractors working for the energy firm.

An official at the Paris prosecutor's office confirmed that Mr Proglio was facing a preliminary investigation into the allegations.

But Mr Proglio, whose tenure at EDF is set to expire in November, denied channelling company cash to his wife's account.

He told Le Monde newspaper: 'Where EDF is concerned, I have at no point placed pressure, either on the company or on any suppliers or contractors, to finance my wife's performances.'

He admitted there had been some confusion over his wife's accounts, saying that while Ms Khalil had declared no income for 2011, tax authorities had established it at 181,122 Euros (£146,000).

But Mr Proglio, who wants to continue as head of EDF, which is France's dominant power provider, and parent company to EDF Energy, one of the biggest in the UK, said this was 'ten times less than the 1.8million Euros cited.'

He also said he had repayed a 60,000 Euro sum that Ms Khalil had received from an EDF-backed association, Electra, in September 2012, before the couple were married in March 2013.

'As soon as I saw this, I took out my cheque book and reimbursed the full amount, well before this was mentioned in the Press,' he said.

And he described the suggestion of the alleged 100,000 Euro cash payment as 'far-fetched'.

News of the scandal came as energy suppliers including EDF Energy, a subsidiary of EDF Group, were told they needed to win back the trust of the British public and explain to customers why bills have not come down when energy prices have fallen.

Industry regulator Ofgem said the 'Big Six' firms, which also comprise British Gas, nPower, E.On, Scottish Power and SSE, said customers should be told why their bills have not come down when the price suppliers pay has fallen 'significantly' after one of the mildest winters on record.

Ofgem's intervention triggered fresh allegations that power firms are profiteering by raising bills as soon as costs go up, but taking their time to cut them when costs go down.

EDF is to build a new nuclear power reactor in Somerset, Hinkley Point C, which it is estimated will produce seven per cent of the UK's power.

MailOnline has requested a comment from EDF.
