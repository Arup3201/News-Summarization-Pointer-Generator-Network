Norwich City have taken the unexpected decision to appoint Neil Adams as their new manager after losing patience with Malky Mackay.

The Canaries were hopeful of appointing the former Cardiff boss this week following extensive talks with the Scotsman.

But on Thursday the club released a statement confirming caretaker boss Adams had been handed the job on a full time basis, signing a three-year deal.

Three-year deal: Neil Adams took charge of the final five games of the season

It is understood the decision comes after Mackay refused to commit himself to the role over the last few days, leaving the Carrow Road club waiting for a definitive answer.

And chairman David McNally has taken the decision to pull the plug on Norwich's interest as a result of Mackay's indecision.

Adams, who led the Canaries to one point out of a possible 15 during his five games in charge, said: 'The priority is to ensure that attacking, attractive and winning football is once again the norm for supporters of this Club, and it is essential that we now have everyone pulling in the same direction for the challenges that lie ahead.'

One of Adams' first priorities will be to resolve goalkeeper John Ruddy's future.

Ruddy is set to quit the club in order to stay in the Barclays Premier League next season.

Ruddy just missed out on selection for England's World Cup squad, but knows staying in the top-flight will enhance his chances of remaining in Roy Hodgson's thoughts.

The 27-year-old is agonising over his future following the Canaries' relegation into the Championship last season.

And it is understood Ruddy, who came close to a joining Chelsea last summer, wants to continue playing regularly at the top level.

However, the keeper is unlikely to consider leaving Carrow Road for a club without the guarantee of first-team football.

Crystal Palace are monitoring Ruddy's situation as fears grow over the future of current No 1 Julian Speroni.

It is also understood Arsenal have been made aware of his potential availability this summer.
