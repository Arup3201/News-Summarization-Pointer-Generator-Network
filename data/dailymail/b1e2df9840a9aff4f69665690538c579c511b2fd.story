Losing your phone or keys is one thing, but losing your glasses - especially if you need them to be able to see what you’re looking for in the first place - can be stressful.

To solve this problem, an Israeli design team has created a clip that attaches to the arm of any pair of glasses or sunglasses, and will beep when they are lost.

It syncs with a smartphone via Bluetooth, or if wearers don’t have a smart device, they can choose to pair it with a keychain remote.

The 1.5-inch (40mm) long clip was designed by Israel-based Dafna Ariely. It attaches to any standard arm on glasses (pictured) or sunglasses, and the clip connects via Bluetooth to a smartphone app or keychain

The clip is the brainchild of Israel-based Dafna Ariely, who has set up an Indiegogo campaign to raise $50,000 (£30,600) to fund production of the device.

The clip weighs less than 20g, has a range of 50ft (15 metres). 

Look is small enough to clip onto the inside of the arm, without touching the wearer's face, and is just 0.4-inches (10mm) wide, 1.5-inches (40mm) long and 0.2-inches (6mm) thick. 

The clip attaches to glasses using adhesive. This means it can be removed easily, or placed on any other item that needs to be tracked. 

It is powered by two lightweight 399 batteries, and comes in black, red, silver and white, and brown. 

If the project is funded, the clip will cost $28 (£17) and the free app will be available on Android and iOS. 

It weighs less than 20g, has a range of 50ft (15 metres), and Ms Ariely claims, wearers will not feel any difference in the weight of their glasses when the clip is attached.

'The idea for Look came about when I couldn’t find my own reading glasses', said Ms Ariely. 

'After all the time I spent and the long, frustrating experience of searching, I thought that if I had something to help me find my glasses, I could have avoided all the pressure and loss of time I experienced. 

'When I didn’t find a product like this on the market, I decided to do it myself.'

‘Until now, similar devices have been generic trackers meant for things like keys and luggage where appearance isn’t important, continued Ms Ariely.

'Look represents a new trend of merging technology and fashion.

If the project is funded, the clip will cost $28 (£17) and the free app will be available on Android and iOS. 

The Indiegogo campaign runs until 2 November and backers can get the clip for a reduced price of $25 (£15) if they pledge their support before this date.
