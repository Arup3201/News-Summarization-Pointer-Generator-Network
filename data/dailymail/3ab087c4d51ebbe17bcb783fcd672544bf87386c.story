Must-have Christmas toys are being sold on eBay at hugely inflated prices.

Touts are cashing in on parents’ desperation to buy this year’s favourites, many of which have now sold out, by adding mark-ups of up to ten times the retail price.

Some retailers have now limited shoppers to one toy each in an attempt to stop buyers from stock- piling the most sought-after items and re-selling them at inflated  prices online.

Analysis of the Toy Retailers Association’s top 12 Christmas toys ‘dream list’ found many selling at twice or three times the recommended retail price (RRP) on eBay.

And The Moshi Monsters Moshling Tree House, usually priced at £18.99, is being sold for as much as £198.98 – more than ten times the recommended amount.

The plastic tree house by Vivid has monsters hidden inside the trunk. Stocks are low in the shops but there are 65 available on eBay.

The LeapFrog LeapPad Explorer learning tablet should be £79.99, but John Lewis, Argos, Tesco, Toys R Us and even the LeapFrog store have sold out.

However it can be found on marketplace websites at up to £225 – nearly three times the price.

Among the more surprising sell-out 
toys is Doggie Doo, a plastic puppy which can be fed at one end and 
produces the inevitable result at the other.

The £22.99 John Adams toy, which comes with a plastic poop scoop, is available on eBay for £58.49.

Fijit Friends, £54.99 squishy robots that can tell jokes, dance to music and hold short conversations, are also selling at twice the price. John Lewis said The VTech InnoTab, an iPad-style toy, has been flying off the shelves at a rate of eight every minute when in stock. Priced at £79.99 in shops, it is being sold for up to £150.99 on eBay.

Lou Ellerton, a consultant in children’s marketing and retail for the Value Engineers, said: ‘This is a very cynical manoeuvre by touts to exploit parents at Christmas.’

She said that parents should try to be ‘realistic’ and assess how long a child will actually use the toy for when considering paying over the odds for it.

A spokesman for ToysRUs said they had brought in a one-item-per customer rule on best-selling toys to stop ‘traders’ buying in bulk.

He said: ‘We are doing everything we can to try to stop this. Where we see that people are buying in bulk and then selling the items on eBay, we stop selling to that person or business.’
