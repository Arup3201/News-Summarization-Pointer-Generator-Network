Bells which ring out every day from a 500-year-old village church could be silenced after a local resident complained they were making too much noise.

St Martin's Church in Liskeard, Cornwall has been a part of the market town since 1428.

But Graham Dutnall, 60, who lives 300 yards away says, the historic church's bells are making too much noise, and has lodged a complaint with the local council.

The bells in St Martin's Church in Liskeard, Cornwall, have rung out across the market town since 1428

Mr Dutnall who recorded the bells' sound at at 85 decibels, as loud as passing traffic, told the council they are 'destroying his peace and quiet'.

Cornwall Council has dispatched environmental health officers with noise measuring equipment to listen for themselves.

If they act upon Mr Dutnall's complaint, church leaders face having to drastically cut down the frequency of the ringing or pay for expensive sound dampening equipment.

Mr Dutnall said: 'Pubs, restaurants, cafes and shops have to have a licence to make noise like that.

'But for some reason church bells seem to be out of the loop - they can do what they like.

'Liskeard is a beautiful, peaceful town but this is ruining all that; it is destroying the peace and quiet in Liskeard.

'They make a hell of a lot of noise - they are designed to be heard.'

Mr Dutnall said he has a direct line of sight to the church and has no way of escaping the bells, which ring out three times each week and can be heard for miles.

He added: 'At the right place and at the right time there's nothing wrong with it. But it is so frequent and so loud.'

Grade I listed St Martin's Church was built as a small church in 1428 but developed over the years with the addition of new chapels, aisles, a chancel and a tower.

It is now one of the largest churches in Cornwall with its current bell tower housing eight bells.

Reverend Tony Ingleby revealed the church had faced a similar complaint before but he was not aware of the latest investigation.

He said the majority of people considered the bells a timeless tradition that helps gives Liskeard its special character.

Mr Ingleby said: 'When you go and live somewhere that is near a church the chances are that there are going to be bells rung.

'There is a church tower and you can see it from the A38. Most people see it as an advantage to hear the bells.

'The team ring every Thursday evening and at 11am and 6pm on Sunday. They are also chimed on a Wednesday, although this is not as loud.

'People had previously reported the bells to the council's environmental health officers but they decided that it was within normal ranges.

'If people have issues with them then I am happy to talk about it but I have not had any complaints.

'When this issue was raised a few years ago there was a great many letters written in support of the bells.'

Other residents of the market town do not share Mr Dutnall's disdain for the bells.

Maggie McPherson, 70, who has lived close to the church for 14 years, described the complaint as 'downright silly'.

She said: 'It's a lovely part of village life. It's unbelievable that someone would complain about such a lovely thing.

'Everyone I know of who lives close by enjoys the bells. They have always been played and I hope they will continue to be played.

'They're not any louder than other church bells I've heard and when I'm in my house I can only hear them very vaguely. I think it's ludicrous for someone to submit a complaint about this.'

Another resident, Maureen Wills, 72, added: 'They've been played every week since I've moved here and I'm very fond of them. It's exactly what you would expect when living close to a church.'

Mr Dutnall's complaint was first raised with Liskeard Town Council, who referred him to Cornwall Council's environmental health department.

A spokesman for Cornwall Council said: 'The Community Protection team of the Council's Public Health and Protection Service investigate complaints of noise from various sources.

'The main legislation that is used when assessing statutory noise nuisance complaints is the Environmental Protection Act 1990.

'There are no set noise limits when determining what a statutory noise nuisance is so trained officers need to determine whether any noise being complained about is an unreasonable interference.

'Many factors are considered when assessing a noise nuisance complaint including the time, duration, frequency and reasonableness of the noise being complained about.

'Each complaint is investigated on its own merits and where it is considered necessary formal action can be taken to ensure that any nuisance is abated.'
