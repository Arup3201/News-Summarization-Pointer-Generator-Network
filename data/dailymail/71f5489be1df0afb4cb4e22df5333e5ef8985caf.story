Fires at an historic city centre pub will have to be put out after a landlord was told it was causing pollution following a passer-by's complaint about smoke in the street.

Graham Rowson, 60, has traditionally lit three fires for customers at his real ale bar so they can keep warm over the Christmas period.

But officials at Preston City Council have now said his 115-year-old Black Horse pub is pumping out fumes - putting it in breach of smokeless zone rules.

Landlord Graham Rowson has been told he has to put out the fires in his pub following a complaint about smoke by a passer-by

Mr Rowson said an inspector turned up at the pub to say a 'passer-by' had seen smoke coming from the chimney 24 hours earlier and put in a complaint.

Mr Rowson has now been ordered to stop burning wood in the Victorian fireplaces and could face a fine of up to £1,000, under the Clean Air Act 1993, if he refuses.

Mr Rowson, who runs the pub with wife Angela, said: 'The fireplaces are part of the history of the building and what makes the pub so popular.

'We’ve actually been named Preston’s city pub of the year by the same council that is now trying to stop what we’re doing.

'All of our regulars are up in arms. Last night we had a party and four councillors, two police officers and two firemen signed our petition to keep the fires. We’ve already got 500 names on the petition and we’re thinking about talking it to court.

'There is no alternative to the log fire. A log burner would produce the same amount of smoke, and I maintain that our fires do not create any smoke anyway.

'I cannot understand the humbug attitudes of some people in authority. They’ll probably ban carol singers next for polluting the atmosphere if they can’t sing.'

The Black Horse is a Grade II-listed building, highly commended by English Heritage, and is on the National Inventory of Historical Pub Interiors.

It was voted Pub of the Year by the Preston Business Improvement District team just seven weeks ago.

It has also featured on a television series and attracts visitors from far afield because of its little-altered interior with wooden panelling, tiled bar and mosaic floor.

The fireplaces and the interior in general led to the pub being awarded a Campaign for Real Ale blue plaque.

But an inspector this week visited the pub to speak to Mr Rowson following a complaint.

The landlord said: 'There was a complaint made on Monday and then straight away a council officer arrived at the pub to tell us to stop burning logs in the fire because we were in a smokeless zone.

'He said someone had complained about smoke outside in the street but that’s nonsense because I’ve stood outside and there isn’t any wafting about.

'I explained that all fires will make smoke when they start and that my fires do not make a lot of smoke.

'I ended up throwing him out of the pub because I couldn’t believe what he was saying.

'You can’t order an historic pub like ours to just stop burning wood in the fireplaces. What do the council want us to do? Get rid of the fireplaces and replace them with radiators?

'On the one hand we have all of the regulations that say that we must retain the character of the Grade II listed building and then you have the council jobsworths talking about health and safety.'

Ray Jackson, the regional director of CAMRA, said: 'I have never heard of anything like it.

'The Black Horse is a cracking pub and it has been refurbished very tastefully by Graham since he went in there. It is part of the character of the building and it would be dreadful if they stopped them having a fire in there.'

A Preston Council spokesman said: 'Burning logs creates pollution through smoke and soot and we have had complaints about the smoke at the Black Horse pub.

'Like most towns and cities, Preston city centre is covered by a smoke control order that means only smokeless fuels can be burned on an open fire.

'Logs can be burned, but only in special wood-burning appliances that take out the soot and smoke. The rules are for the benefit of everyone and we are happy to work with the business owner to help them comply.'
