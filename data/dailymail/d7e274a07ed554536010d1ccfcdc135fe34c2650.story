Police were at the centre of a furious row last night amid claims they acted unlawfully by demanding the arrest of the parents of dying Ashya King.

Officers are accused of over-reaching their powers by issuing a European Arrest Warrant for the five-year-old’s parents Brett, 51, and Naghmeh, 45.

Senior lawyers said there was little evidence the pair had committed any offence or that police undertook a satisfactory criminal inquiry.

Devoted: The Kings with Ashya at Southampton hospital before they took him to Spain

Officers are accused of over-reaching their powers by issuing a European Arrest Warrant for the five-year-old's parents Brett, 51, and Naghmeh, 45

One said the actions of the Hampshire force, apparently under the direction of hospital doctors, throws into question the role of police in modern society.

Barrister John Cooper said police risk appearing as the ‘enforcement arm of medical opinion’.

‘The police are there to protect citizens and the easy transition to uncritical enforcers of other powerful interest groups is troubling,’ he said.

‘We should remind ourselves that this was a case of two adults who had parental control, who lawfully took their child from a hospital, and by all accounts cared for his welfare in an attempt to give him a chance at life.’

The Kings are now being held in a Spanish jail five hours’ drive from their son who is alone and under guard in hospital.

By obtaining a European Arrest Warrant, investigators accused them of ‘child cruelty’. Now the Kings find themselves trapped in a legal nightmare, following their arrest on Saturday night at a hotel in Malaga.

Lawyers said the arrest warrant appears to have been used as a ‘tool’ to find the family, rather than as a method to catch suspected criminals.

They said warrants are normally granted only when officers are ready to lay charges, whereas any inquiry in Southampton had barely got under way.

Edward Grange, who specialises in extradition cases at London law firm Hodge Jones & Allen, said he was deeply concerned at the Kings’ treatment.

He said: ‘My concern is that they are seeking to use this warrant while their investigations are ongoing and that is most unusual. We have not been told if the couple involved have committed any crime. They cannot be charged with abducting their own child. There was no protection order in place regarding the boy so they have not absconded with the child against the orders of a court.’

In a further twist, lawyers said Ashya could have dual nationality because he was born in Spain. As a result, the authorities may regard him as Spanish and refuse to allow him to be returned to Britain against the wishes of his parents.

Yesterday Portsmouth City Council revealed that Ashya was made a temporary ward of court on Friday. This will be reviewed at the High Court tomorrow. It is not clear whether this will involve the controversial Court of Protection.

Last night, Hampshire Police refused to discuss its actions and said the matter was now in the hands of the Spanish police.

At the weekend Assistant Chief Constable Chris Shead said the force would not apologise for the way it conducted the search for the Kings. He said it was acting on ‘explicit medical advice’ that Ashya’s life was in danger and said the warrant was based around ‘neglect’.

It is understood that once Ashya had left Britain, senior officers felt they had no choice but to apply for the arrest warrant to secure the co-operation of other forces.

The Crown Prosecution Service said the warrant was issued on the grounds of ‘child cruelty’ and the case remained ‘under immediate review’.

The National Crime Agency, which clears European Arrest Warrants, said it looks only at the ‘legal validity’ of the paperwork. In effect this means officials simply check that the 11-page document is correctly filled in.

Hampshire Police and Crime Commissioner Simon Hayes defended the county’s force against accusations of being ‘heavy handed’.

He said: ‘I think if Hampshire Constabulary had ignored the professional medical advice and opinion then they would have been negligent in their responsibilities to safeguard Ashya.’
