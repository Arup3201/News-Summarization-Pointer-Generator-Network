A woman who took a cab ride from New York City to Boston, Massachusetts that cost $980 was arrested on Wednesday night after she refused to pay the fare.

The cab driver picked up Denice C. Rebelato, 31, at JFK International Airport and told her the trip could cost as much as $1,000.

Framingham Police say she agreed to pay but when she arrived home, Rebelato asked for her luggage before telling the driver the money for the bill was in the house.

'No, get the cash first,' driver Adam Chaudry replied.

Denise C. Rebelato: After taking a cab from New York City to Framingham, a Boston suburb, she was arrested after refusing to pay the $1,000 cab fare

The deal: The cab driver picked up Deice C. Rebelato, 31, at JFK International Airport and told her the trip would cost as much as $1,000, Framingham Police say. She agreed to pay

Excuses: Rebelato told the driver: 'I have so many problems. I just came from Brazil'

A police report states: 'Ms. Rebelato went into the house for 10 minutes and returned saying she did not have money and that her credit card was no good.'

The cab driver then gave Rebelato a ride for free to the Framingham Police station.

Rebelato said she wanted to pay, but said 'I have so many problems. I just came from Brazil,' the report explained.

Ms. Rebelato became argumentative saying she did not have money because she can’t work.

She went on to say how her son was abused years ago and she can’t keep a job because of it.

Together again: Denise with her son David Rebelato-Shallow. His mother had been in Brazil before flying back to New York and taking a taxi to Boston

Thief: When she arrived at her home, Rebelato told the driver the $980 for the ride was in the house. The driver told her she would be unable to retrieve the bags until after she had paid

Gloating: Rebelato has even been boasting about her antics on her Facebook page

Police placed her under arrest and charged her with larceny over $250.

Prosecutor Lauren Montes said the charges would be dropped if Rebelato agreed to pay $980.

Judge Robert Greco's was shocked by the amount of money at stake.

'From New York? From New York, you said? That's how much it cost?' Judge Greco asked. 'They have buses!'

Rebelato agreed to pay the money within 60 days. Greco said the case will be dismissed if she does so. If not, the case will continue.
