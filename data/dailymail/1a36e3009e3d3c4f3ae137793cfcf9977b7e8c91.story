Suspect: Roland Cummings is suspected of stabbing to death Aurele Fecteau, a man he knew and had helped around his home

Police have arrested a 44-year-old man for the fatal stabbing of a 92-year-old Maine man two weeks ago in his home.

Authorities say Roland Cummings is scheduled make his first appearance on a murder charge either Monday or Tuesday in Kennebec County Superior Court in Augusta.

Cummings was arrested Friday in connection with the May 23 death of Aurele Fecteau, who was found stabbed to death in his bed at his home in Waterville.

Police say Cummings knew the victim and used to do odd jobs around Fecteau's house.

Cummings'
 sister, Deborah Berry of Waterville, tells the Morning Sentinel that 
her brother has been struggling with drug addiction. It's unclear if he 
has a lawyer.

Cummings grew up in the Bingham and Waterville areas, lives with his mother and is not employed.

Detectives said Fecteau was stabbed to death in his bed and that Fecteau's house had been burglarized.

Fecteau's body was found by relatives who became concerned after not hearing from him for a few days.

They were horrified to discover the violent way in which Aurele Fecteau's life ended.

His daughter-in-law Lorraine Fecteau told WGME that the family is in shock and they did not expect 'his life would be cut short in such a horrific way.'

Horrific end: Aurele Fecteau was a father of seven who lived alone in his Maine home after his wife passed away in 1999

Neighbors also became concerned about the nonagenarian after his lawn became overgrown.

'He was good about keeping his lawn mowed,' neighbor Nancy Morissett told the Press Herald.

'He used a riding mower even with him not being able to see too good; heâ€™d be out there, and I thought last night it was kind of strange because I saw him two or three days ago.'

Fecteau had lived alone since his wife Jeanne died in 2009 but his children were frequent visitors.

Fecteau was a father of seven and an avid outdoorsman who loved hunting, fishing and gardening.

'He was a good man, a good family man,' Marjory Clifford told the Press Herald.

'He was a home man; his boys took him fishing in the summer. He took care of his grounds; he was always working on his gardens and his house.'

Prior to his retirement, he was employed as a paper machine tender by Hollingsworth & Whitney, later Scott Paper Co., for 40 years.
