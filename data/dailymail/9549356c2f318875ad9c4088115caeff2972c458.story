As the old saying goes, 'keep your friends close and your enemies closer'.

But this cricket took the old adage to a new level as it perched on the head of a green papua tree frog - its natural predator.

The brave insect dices with death, crawling along a red petal as the frog used the flower as a makeshift resting spot.

Making its move: The brave cricket dices with death as it clambers on to a petal where a green papua tree frog - its natural predator - is relaxing

Friends close, enemies closer: The cricket does not seem fussed by the frog as it walks along the petal, standing on the amphibian's side

Not cricket: Usually the frog would gobble up the insect without a thought, but the two seem to become friends as the cricket explores the creature's face

As it crawls forward, the cricket brushes against the frog, standing on its side and almost poking the frog in the eye.

Seemingly taking a shine to each other, the cricket then climbs atop the amphibian's head, standing over its left eye - just an inch from the frog's mouth.

The cricket gets itself comfortable on the frog's head before, settling down for a quick snooze on his unlikely friend.

The green papua tree frog is predominantly found in the north and east of Australia, as well as southern parts of Papua New Guinea and Indonesia.

Living mostly in swamps and pond areas, it thrives in wet, humid conditions.

They are not endangered, but are often eaten by cats and dogs.

In Indonesia, as many as 75,000 of the frogs are exported to become pets a year. 

The incredible pictures were taken by  nature photographer Monica Anantyowati in her back garden in Malang, on the east of Java, Indonesia.

'This set is about two different species, a predator and his prey, taking a rest together on the petal of a flower,' the 42-year-old said.  

'They sat with each other for a long time, which I found weird as a cricket would usually be a frog's main course for dinner. 

'They seemed to make friends with each other, which was actually quite cute.'

Ms Anantyowati said: 'I was surprised that this happened, as usually the frog would devour the cricket in seconds, especially if he was hungry.

'It wasn't planned at all. I left them to quickly get my camera and lens, and when I came back they still were still sat peacefully.

'Many people are as surprised as me and ask a same question, why did this happen? Nature is a mystery.

'I love photography because it teaches me things that cannot see by the naked eye,' she added.

That's better: Resting its head on top of the frog's forehead, the pair look very content as they lay down for a quick snooze together
