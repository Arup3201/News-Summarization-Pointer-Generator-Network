Accused: Steve Sells has been arrested after his daughter was found severely malnourished

A father has been arrested after his mentally disabled 15-year-old daughter was found covered in feces and weighing just 35 pounds.

Father-of-three Steve Sells, 58, from Anderson, Indiana, was arrested on Monday night - but he insisted that his daughter was so small because of her medical condition, authorities said.

Family members had taken the girl to St. Vincent Hospital in Anderson on Monday afternoon. Doctors contacted police and she was then flown to Peyton Manning Children's Hospital in Indianapolis for treatment.

Authorities said her condition could be life threatening.

Anderson Police told Fox59 that the teenager, who is mentally disabled, was severely malnourished and covered in feces when she was taken to hospital.

She weighed just 35 pounds, which is the average weight of a five-year-old child. 

Neighbor Thomas McAllister told the station that Sells and his wife lived at the home with their three children.

He said that Sells had always given the impression he was a caring father.

'That is mind boggling,' he added. 'That is just disgusting and no child should have to go through anything like that.'

Sells' wife returned home on Monday evening but refused to speak to reporters, FOX59 said. 

Family: He lives at the home with his wife Joetta (pictured) and his three children. His wife was questioned by police but so far he is the only person arrested in connection with the case, police said

Sells was the only family member arrested, but other family members have been questioned, The IndyChannel reported.  

The man blamed his daughter's low weight on a medical condition, Anderson Police Detective Joel Sandefur told WTHR, but 'that has to be investigated to see if it's even plausible or not', he said.

The detective did not provide any details about that or the nature of the girl's disability. 

'It's troubling to see a human being treated in this manner, especially when it's a family member of someone, someone's own child,' he added.

Scene: Sells, who lives at this Anderson home, said his daughter's weight was due to her condition

Sells will faces preliminary child neglect charges. He will likely face more serious charges if his daughter does not survive her injuries.

He is currently being held on a 72-hour hold and it is not clear whether he has an attorney.  

Anderson is about 40 miles northeast of Indianapolis.
