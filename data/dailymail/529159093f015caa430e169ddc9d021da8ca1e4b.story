Feminist activists staged a topless protest outside the Tunisian embassy in Paris today to mark the opening of the trial of three women accused of public indecency in the North African country. 

The three women, Pauline Hillier, Marguerite Stern and Josephine Markmann, are all members of the protest group Femen and were arrested last month when they appeared topless outside the Tunisian Palace of Justice.

The trio of women, two French and one German, were demonstrating against the conviction of Amina Tyler, a Tunisian member, who staged a similar protest online.

Lawyers representing several Islamist groups petitioned to delay the trial of the three European women so they could join as plaintiffs.

Draped in traditional white 
Tunisian cloaks, the women appeared in the same court they had
 demonstrated in front of while dozens of people protested against them outside.

They have been charged with public indecency and being a threat to 
public order.

Witnesses
 said one European woman held a sign supporting Femen but immediately 
drew the ire of the crowd and was hustled away by police.

Feminist activist group Femen, originating in the Ukraine, is famous for its topless protests.

Under
 the Tunisian legal system, outside groups can join a trial as 'injured 
parties,' become privy to the case files and sue for damages.

The 
addition of new plaintiffs would likely increase the duration of the 
trial.

A crowd outside the Tunisian court turned angry and the women were arrested

The trio approached the entrance to the ministry wearing coats which they took off, revealing naked torsos scrawled with 'Breasts Feed Revolution'.

Wearing just jean shorts, the women chanted in English 'Free Amina' and 'Women's spring is coming' as people in the crowd attempted to cover them.

The women then climbed up on the gates of the Justice Ministry until police pulled them down and hustled them shouting into the building as an angry crowd gathered.

The three activists were calling for the 
release of Tyler, who is also known as Amina Sboui, who scandalized the 
country by posting topless photos of herself protesting for women's 
rights in March

In the images that appeared on Facebook she had written  'My body belongs to me' written across her bare chest in Arabic.

She was taken into hiding by her family after conservative preachers issued death threats against her.

She later attempted another protest on May 19 in the 
religious center of Kairouan, where she was arrested.

Tyler, also known as Amina Sboui, received death threats after posting these images on Facebook with the words 'my body belongs to me' written in Arabic across her chest

She appeared before an investigating judge in Kairouan today who 
will decide if she is to be charged with public indecency and 
desecrating a cemetery.

Tyler was already convicted of carrying pepper 
spray.

In Paris, 10 topless Femen members prayed and waved placards outside the Tunisia embassy dressed only in their underwear and stockings.

The women wrote slogans across their chest calling for the release of the four women in Tunisia.

Other slogans including 'Allah created me free', 'there will be millions of us' and 'woman spring is coming', in reference to a revolution of women's rights similar to the Arab Spring.

In Berlin, German government spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters today that Chancellor Angela Merkel would likely raise questions of human rights and the rule of law during her meeting on Friday with the Tunisian prime minister.

He did not say if the case of the 19-year-old German on trial would be discussed.
