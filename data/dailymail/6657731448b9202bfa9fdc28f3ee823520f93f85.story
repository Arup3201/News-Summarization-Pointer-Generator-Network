Every woman wants to look their best for their wedding day but one bride went to extreme lengths.

Liz Kerslake, 39, from Plymouth, lost five stone and five dress sizes on a grueling calorie restricted diet in a bid to look perfect for her wedding day.

The pretty brunette had previously been spurred on to lose weight after a cruel former partner called her 'fat and ugly'.

Liz Kerslake from Plymouth dropped five dress sizes after piling on the pounds before her wedding

Liz says she used to have a takeaway every night and would drink a couple of glasses of wine as well 

Stunning Liz might now be rocking an athletic eight-and-a-half stone body but, only two years ago, she tipped the scales at a bloated 13st 8lb.

But this isn't the first time she's beat the battle of the bulge. During her first marriage Liz, a new home saleswoman, became comfortable and piled on the pounds.

She decided to lose the weight however when her hubby insulted her looks, hitting the gym, cutting calories and dropping four stone.   

And it wasn't just the weight she lost. Liz eventually left her husband behind too and as they were going through their divorce in 2008, she met her now husband Nick. 

But as their relationship blossomed, 5ft 6in Liz stopped going to the gym and the weight piled on again.

Ahead of their wedding last summer, she was determined to get rid of her belly and fit into her sleek white gown.

Following her extreme diet which sees Liz have a protein shake for breakfast and nothing for lunch she is now a size eight and happy with her body

Liz wanted to look perfect for her second wedding after her first husband told her she was 'fat and ugly' 

A newly svelte Liz said: 'I was determined to look the best on mine and Nick's big day. When we got together I'd been hitting the gym four or five times a week.

'I felt really comfortable and stopped exercising but carried on eating the same. The weight piled back on and I was worried I would look bloated on my wedding day.' 

Liz lost four stone thanks to rigorous calories counting. She met her now husband Nick,  while going through her first divorce in 2008

In a desperate attempt to shed the inches, Liz signed up to the National Slimming & Cosmetic Clinics (NSCC) weight loss plan.

She had heard about her local clinic in Plymouth from a male friend who had lost two stone and looked 'incredible'.

Liz said: 'The final push to really do something about my weight came when Nick proposed. We set the date for the summer of 2014 and that gave me a goal.

'Within the first week of signing up with NSC I saw results. As soon as I could see a difference in the way I looked I was looking for reasons to stay on track.

'Before then I had always looked for an excuse to fall off the wagon.'

As part of the NSCC plan, Liz visited the clinic every two weeks and met with the manager Karina where they discussed her goals and diet.

Due to the demands of her work, Liz very rarely finds time to make it to the gym during the week, but mixed her healthier diet with walking her Chihuahua, Roxy, for up to an hour a day.

Liz said: 'I had never snacked and always thought I'd been quite healthy but I could never shift the weight.

'What really worked for me was cutting out carbs. Where I'd normally have bread for breakfast and lunch, I'd swap that for a meal focused on protein.'

Liz says she started to see results as soon as she joined up to her slimming club

Liz says cutting carbs is what worked best for her and focusing on meals that had a lot of protein in them 

Eight months on from Liz and Nick's glorious wedding, she has managed to maintain her weight loss and feels much healthier.

Liz said: 'When I'd tried before I'd eventually put the weight back on, but with NSC I've managed to keep it off.

'Two years on and now married the weight has stayed off. My clinic still support me through the maintenance of my weight loss and continue to make me feel part of a very big and successful family.

'Now I know I can walk into a shop and pick up a size eight dress and know it will fit - the same as buying something online. It's given me so much more confidence.'
