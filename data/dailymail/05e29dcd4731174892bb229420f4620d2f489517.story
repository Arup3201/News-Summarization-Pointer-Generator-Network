Women have been trying to figure out what men want for decades, devouring dating tomes such as Men Are From Mars Women Are From Venus in the hope they might bring them closer to the answer.

Today, new research promises to offer an insight into the mysterious workings of a man's heart.

A study of 2,000 men has revealed that the 'perfect 
girlfriend' is 5ft 5in tall, drinks white wine, has no tattoos and 
supports Manchester United.

The survey by dating app company LOVOO also found that men go for a woman with an Irish accent and who drive a Mini Cooper.

And it's bad news for single vegetarians, with the majority of men agreeing that they like a girl who enjoys meat and loves a roast dinner.

Ladies can breath a small sigh of relief when it comes to weight though, with men's expectations not being too unrealistic, preferring a woman who weighs a healthy 9st 2lbs, and has a bra size of 34C.

Single men also had an opinion as to what their dates should be watching, possibly to avoid any scraps over the remote control? Their first choice was Game of Thrones, followed by Coronation Street, Friends and then Match of the Day.

When it comes to films, Dirty Dancing is their ideal girl's film of choice and rock is her favourite music genre.

They don't want her sitting around watching too many Patrick Swayze classics though. The survey revealed that they would rather date a hard-working woman, with a nurse and teacher being the top professions of choice.

When asked what celebrity would best resemble their perfect girlfriend, Kelly Brook took the lead followed by Cheryl Cole, Jessica Ennis and Denise Van Outen.

A spokesman for LOVOO said that the men's choices may be slightly unrealistic and that they should keep their options open: 'It seems that British men have very specific tastes for a girl to live up to.

'We know that everyone has a favourite hair colour and sometimes even eye colour and height, with brown hair being the colour of choice in this instance.

'But we think that avoiding a woman because she might support an opposing football team or enjoy a different genre of films to you, might be being a bit too picky.'

They went on to say that having too many specific ideas of the perfect partner is the reason why some men may be finding it difficult to find a partner.

'We encourage meeting up with people you share interests with, but suggest not being too strict as you might find that you get to learn something new.

'Dating is fun and shouldn't become a chore or make you feel as though you won't ever find "the one". Being more open to new things will certainly help you find that perfect girlfriend.'

Thankfully there were some things that men were happy to keep their options open about. Their perfect partner enjoys a wide range of hobbies, including reading and travelling.

They also want a woman with a full social life who loves to go to bars with their friends and enjoys going to concerts.

When it comes to sex, men want their perfect girlfriend to 
be adventurous in the bedroom, and be happy to embark in a bit of 
role play as well as enjoy experimenting with different positions.

Although men want a girl who can impress them, the study revealed it is
 also importantÂ  for their girlfriend to get on with the other most 
important woman in their life - their mum.

Open minded: Men prefer a woman who will experiment in the bedroom

Despite their rather specific desires, such as preferring women to wear miniskirts or skinny jeans, three quarters of the single men said they don't think they will meet their perfect woman and will have to compromise instead.

And it appears that a lot of men have already learned the art of compromise with two in five men in a relationship believing that their current wife or girlfriend isn't the perfect woman for them.

The spokesman added: 'It is very surprising that so many men who are currently in a relationship, feel as though they aren't with the right woman for them.

'And it's sad to see that some single men don't believe the perfect woman exists.

'We want to show these men that we don't agree, there is someone out there for everyone.

'And if they're lucky they might even find their perfect woman in time for Valentine's Day.'
