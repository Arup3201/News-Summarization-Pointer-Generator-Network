During his days at Liverpool, goalkeeper Pepe Reina quickly forged a name for himself as a 'sweeper-keeper' due to his impressive ability with the ball at his feet.

But he may just have dramatically enhanced that reputation.

The Bayern Munich goalkeeper executed a tremendous bicycle kick during a game of football-tennis with his team-mates at the German club.

Reina soon pulled off this incredible bicycle kick and stunned his fellow team-mates

Reina leapt up acrobatically to meet a neat shoulder flick from Robert Lewandowski and was mobbed by the striker and Brazil defender Dante after the stunning move came off.

Bayern Munich are currently at a training camp in Doha, Qatar following the winter break in Germany.

The Bundesliga leaders resume their season on Friday with a trip to Wolfsburg.
