The father of missing Utah woman Susan Powell - who has been missing since 2009 - is determined to keep looking for his daughter even though police have given up, and still has hope she may be alive, it emerged today.

Chuck Cox, from Oregon, has now dedicated his life to finding his daughter and spends most of his days traveling along Interstate 84 - where he believes Josh Powell may have disposed of her body - and following up tips.

He retired from his job as a veteran crash investigator with the Federal Aviation Administration so he could spend his days searching.

His experience tells him his daughter - who was just 28-years-old when she disappeared - is dead, but the father in him dearly wants to believe she is alive.

Grieving: Mrs Powell's parents Chuck and Judy Cox outside their home after their grandsons' death. Chuck said he will not stop searching for his daughter

Missing: Susan Powell vanished from the couple's Utah home in 2009. She had said she feared her husband

Remembrance: Chuck and Judy Cox, left, are joined by Susan's sister Denise Cox, right, and her fiancé, Andrew Olsen, at Woodbine Cemetery in Puyallup, where Susan's sons Charlie and Braden Powell are buried

Susan Powell was last seen at her home on December 6, 2009. Her husband Josh took their two sons on an impromptu camping trip even though it was mid winter and freezing temperatures.

He was later named a person of interest but was never arrested in the case. Cox strongly believed he was responsible for the disappearance of Susan and begged police to arrest Josh.

But they never did, and three years later during a supervised visit with his sons, Josh took an axe to them and killed them before setting his Washington home on fire, killing all three of them.

His brother has since committed suicide and his father is currently serving time in jail for voyeurism. Cox believes that all three of them had a hand in Susan's disappearance.

Due to the stress of the ordeal, Cox has lost 60 pounds. It has also taken its toll on his relationship with his wife and remaining daughters who want him to give up.

'If it were up to me, I'd pack up and be gone. I'd buy a camper and stay on the road until I found her,' he told the LA Times. 'I tell my daughters I love them, but that I'm going to find Susan. I'm not going to give up on her. I can't.'

One of his daughters Denise Olsen, 34, sometimes helps her dad on his searches and explains how - even four years later - her sister's disappearance still has a heavy effect on him.

Piling on the pressure: In newly-released tapes, Josh Powell evaded questions from the police the day after his wife Susan disappeared in 2009

'After losing Susan, he's been a lot 
more open and understanding,' she said. 'But every time he talks of not 
stopping until he finds her, his eyes tear up. And you just have to 
change the subject.'

Cox is getting no help from police - they stopped their search for Susan in
May announcing they had run out of leads and had no choice but to wait
for new information.

This frustrates him greatly as he believes they are holding on to vital evidence which could help him finally find his daughter.

Cox is considering suing West Valley City police because they refuse to 
release case files and have treated him like he is a 'meddling parent 
rather than a veteran investigator', he said.

'I was the victim's father, a parent. The idea was, "We can't trust him. He's a civilian, not 
capable of grasping the intricacies of police work". In reality, I was a
veteran investigator.

'But I wasn't a cop. I didn't carry a gun. I 
understood why they didn't include me. They had to do the investigation.
But their look always said, "You're not one of us".'

Devoted: Cox is not ready to give up. He has had no satisfaction of a conviction for either his daughter or grandsons and has not had the closure of a funeral. So he continues to spend his days searching and hoping 

Explosion: Josh Powell set his home on fire, killing himself and his two sons in 2012

Mike Powell - no relation - a deputy police chief in West Valley City, explained their decision to distance him to the LA Times.

'Just because he was an FAA investigator 
doesn't make him part of this investigation. It wasn't 
prudent to tell him everything that was going on,' he said.

'There are aspects to this case that are not for public consumption. We have to respect the privacy of certain individuals.'

Cox
has turned his home in Puyallup into his headquarters where he looks 
through case files, works on tips from the public and writes his blog. 
He is considering getting a cadaver dog to help him in his search.

His blogs also encourage women with abusive husbands to get help.

And as he searches, he still speaks of Susan like she is alive.

'She's a very happy person, the kind 
who'd find a roomful of manure and say all this means is there's got to 
be a pony in here somewhere,' he said, using the present tense.
