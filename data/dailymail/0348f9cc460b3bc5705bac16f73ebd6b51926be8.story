The father of Martin Richard, the eight-year-old boy who was killed in the Boston Marathon bombings, has revealed that he accidentally still sets the table for five.

In a moving article in the Boston Globe, Bill Richard said that he and his wife Denise notice the hole where Martin should be every day - from family trips to sports games to an empty seat in the back of the car. And after setting one plate too many at the dinner table, Bill quietly puts the extra away.

Tuesday will mark one year since Martin was killed near the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon. His then-seven-year-old sister Jane's lost her left leg in the tragedy, while Bill's ear drums were ruptured and Denise was struck with shrapnel, leaving her blind in one eye.

Their eldest son Henry could do nothing but watch in horror and call out for his brother as smoke swirled around them, and is now working through his emotional wounds. As Jane told doctors: 'My brother Henry only got some cuts, but was hurt in his heart.'

Strong: Bill Richard shares a playful moment with his daughter, Jane, as the two wait for a doctor at a Boston Hospital in February. The family have spoken out about their grief and their endurance a year after son Martin was killed in the bombings

Fighter: Jane, who lost a leg in the bombings, strides down the hallway of United Prosthetics in Dorchester last month after learning she would be getting a special prosthesis that would help her run. Her father Bill is pictured left

Joy: Jane, 8, grins as she gets her first look at the running blade that she will be fitted with at United Prosthetics in Dorchester

Thankful: Jane, who has remained active since the tragedy, hugs Gary Martino of United Prosthetics who had helped fit her new running blade

Now the family - who have stayed largely out of the public eye all year - are sharing how they have battled their grief, and how they have been touched by the unwavering support of friends, strangers and even celebrities - including Taylor Swift, who has sent the family a signed guitar and clothes for Jane.

They have also been welcomed to the White House, where they met President Obama and his wife Michelle just ahead of Christmas. The First Lady complimented Jane on her dress and Jane complimented the first family on their decorations.

'I was up all night setting them up,' President Obama jokingly told them.

As Bill and Denise pushed through Martin's favorite events, such as Halloween, and worried about the grief hitting them, they were stunned by the determination of their children.

Jane, now 8, was put in a medically-induced coma after the bombings and underwent 14 surgeries, before learning how to walk again at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.

She returned to school after the summer and has been fitted with different prosthetics, including a curved leg that will help her run.

Well wishers: Bill Richard reads a letter from a school in Oregon at his family's home - just one of thousands of kind letters that the family has received

Gifts: Among the presents that the family have received is this sketch of Martin for a calendar by artist Dianne Nyitray-Kaericher

Missed: A Phoenix Coyotes jersey emblazoned with Martin Richard's name, worn by defenseman Keith Yandle, hangs in the window of the family's living room

Jane has been matter-of-fact about her 
injury, even using her leg for Show and Tell and answering questions 
from inquisitive classmates, the Globe reported.

Henry
 also returned to school after the bombings and the Richards declined 
special services offered by the school, insisting that their son should 
not be singled out because of the tragedy.

He
 quickly fell back into his routine, taking part in sports events and 
remaining on the honor roll. Then earlier this year, the family received
 the fantastic news that he had been accepted to Boston Latin School, an
 elite school that only accepted 500 students from across the city.

But
 Henry has also shown moments of sadness, including when he learned a 
text message his brother had sent him ahead of the marathon had 
disappeared.

He would sometimes look at his parents and say: 'I miss Martin.'

The family decided to take their love for Martin and set up a foundation, Team MR8, in his memory. The charity will focus on bringing his world view to others, explaining that he was a school peacemaker and recognized at a young age that while we are all different, we are all the same'.

Celebration: Jane covers her ears as organizers, runners, and members of her family - including her parents and big brother Henry, center - cheer during a group photo at a kick-off for Team MR8, the Richard family's marathon team to honor Martin

Fears: Denise Richard comforts her daughter Jane as a video showing images of the 2013 Boston Marathon before the bombing play during a meeting for the family's 2014 marathon team set up in Martin's honor

Battle: Jane's mother Denise (center) looks on as the little girl uses a treadmill during a session with physical therapist Jean Murby in February

More than 100 runners are raising money for MR8 - which supports sports and academics - in the marathon next Monday, and have so far raised more than $880,000, far surpassing the aim of $750,000.

When Bill appeared at the foundation's launch in February he told guests that the family knew they had to do it for Martin.

'It became clear to us over the last few months that we would not run from the [Marathon] but embrace it to help us heal, to honor my son and his message, and to pay it forward,' he said.

He told the runners that his son had been determined to run a marathon as soon as he was old enough. He encouraged them to shout for joy for Martin as they crossed the finish line.

'His first marathon is yours,' he told them.

The moving Boston Glove article comes after another interview this weekend, in which Bill described the terrifying moments following the bombings.

Contemplation: Bill, who suffered two perforated ear drums in the explosion, has taken to meditation to help deal with the pain and grief

Quiet: Henry Richard flips through his homework at home before leaving for school in February. Earlier this year, the family learned that Henry, who has persevered quietly through his grief, had been accepted into one of the top schools in the area

Close watch: Denise Richard watches as her 12-year-old son, Henry, walks to his school bus stop in Dorchester in February

By his side: Pictured last month, Denise puts her arm around her son, Henry, as they leave track practice, one of the many activities that keep him busy

He recounted how he had urged his family to leave after they heard the first bomb - but the second detonated beside them moments later.

Jane screamed when she saw her left leg had gone and called out for her brother Martin, who was already dead. Henry was covered in nails which had been packed into the pressure cooker and had burns on his legs.

Bill could barely hear and had a ball
 bearing buried deep in his left shin. His jeans and trainers had been 
torn and he kept repeating to himself: 'It happened. It happened.'

In the chaos afterwards doctors tried to calm him down but he told them: 'Relax? My son is dead. How can I relax?'

As
 they arrived at hospital he took a call on his mobile phone from Denise
 who was at a different hospital and she confirmed what he suspected 
already, that Martin was dead.

Jane was distraught and asked from her stretcher: 'Where's Martin? Where's Martin?'

Bill tried to calm Henry down and stop him crying by telling him: 'Jane and Mom are OK, and we're going to be OK.'

Staying busy: Jane, who underwent 14 surgeries following the bombings, makes a braid out of pipe cleaners as she gets ready for school in February

Joy: Her parents look on as Jane reacts to a magician after he performed a card trick during her eighth birthday party earlier this year

Standing tall: Jane is pictured walking on her new leg last October with her choir before they sang the national anthem at a Red Sox game

The interview with the family also reveals how things could so easily have been different.

Ahead of the marathon, Bill had been busy with the environmental company he ran and the rest of the family were a 'whirlwind of pickups and drop-offs, sleepovers and birthday parties, homework, community projects, coaching, and church'.

They
 nearly went away for the weekend of the marathon but Bill had too much 
work on and could not get the time off, he explained.

Their
 three children were only so close to the barricades because a couple 
standing in front of them on Boylston Street let them go in front - and 
right next to the bomb.

The
 two suspects accused of the bombing, brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan 
TsarnaevÂ  and were caught during a shootout with police in Boston.

Tamerlan, 26, was shot dead and Dzhokhar, 20, is currently awaiting trial in Boston.
