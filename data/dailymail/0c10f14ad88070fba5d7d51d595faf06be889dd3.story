Jurgen Klinsmann watched this shambles play out from a comfy, cushioned seat in the directors' box at White Hart Lane.

The temptation at half-time, when his beloved Tottenham trooped off 2-0 down to a chorus of boos, was to ask him to take charge after the break. Let’s face it, why wait?

These days Klinsmann, who turned down the Spurs job last year in the build up to the World Cup, is head coach of the USA soccer team. The Americans, playing catch-up on Tottenham’s 132-year history, get the game better than the group of players allotted to Mauricio Pochettino.

Ratings by NEIL ASHTON at White Hart Lane 

There will be another inquest up at the training ground on Monday after Pochettino’s team slumped to their four defeat in five home matches in the Barclays Premier League.

Stoke were streets ahead of them: slick, organised, disciplined and focused. All the things Tottenham want to be but never will be.

Doesn’t it hurt to be booed off at half-time? Isn’t it humiliating to be dragged off, as Christian Eriksen and Andros Townsend were, after just 45 minutes?

‘Tactical reasons,’ claimed Pochettino. Code for dreadful. It is unbearable.

Stoke were rampant in the first half, taking the lead through the wriggling figure of Bojan Krkic and doubling it when Jonathan Walters scored with a simple tap in. Nice, easy money.

Bar Nacer Chadli’s glorious strike, a volley at the back stick 12 minutes from time, this was dreadful. There is no patter to Tottenham’s play.

We were promised one of the best coaches in world football, one of the most innovative in the Premier League when Pochettino was head-hunted from Southampton. He doesn’t have the answers.

To watch Emmanuel Adebayor delay his arrival as a substitute when his team were 2-0 down by electing to changing his boots makes you feel sick.

That is what the half-hour warm up is for and the weather conditions hadn’t changed. Instead, the storm clouds are gathering here again.

When they were chasing the game seven minutes from time, their dopey right back Kyle Naughton was dismissed for a foolish nudge on Victor Moses.

So, to Stoke, then, and this glitzy performance.,

Bojan’s first goal in English football was a good ‘un, ghosting - make that coasting - past Tottenham’s non-existent defence to lash the opener beyond Hugo Lloris.

Can Bojan, once tipped to be even better that Lionel Messi during his spell at Barcelona, do it on a wet, windy night in Stoke?

That’s not so clear cut, but what we do know is that the little Spanish forward found White Hart Lane to his liking.

The beauty of playing Tottenham is that you always know they will give you a chance sooner or later. They obliged, of course they did.

Even when Stoke were forced into a defensive reshuffle, they were untroubled throughout a first half dominated by Hughes’ side.

Phil Bardsley succumbed to injury after nine minutes and was replaced by Geoff Cameron. Marc Wilson was substituted for Marc Muniesa after 26. Moments later, Stoke scored again.

This defence needs sorting out because the goal Walters scored was too easy.

Mame Diouf bounced through unchallenged, into the danger zone and placed the ball into the path of Walters for the Stoke forward to finish off the job.

By this time it was borderline embarrassing.

Apart from the scoreline, Spurs’ contribution to the first half was a long range effort from Ryan Mason that hit the side-netting. Seriously, that was it.

There are rumblings of discontent around these parts and it is becoming increasingly difficult to protect Pochettino.

His team, who fluked a win at Aston Villa last weekend after Christian Benteke was dismissed, were hopelessly under-prepared for Stoke.

Even Harry Kane - ‘he is one of us’ as they sing - couldn’t get going, try as he might.

Sadly for Kane, Stoke’s giant of a centre half Ryan Shawcross handled him impeccably. The kid hardly got a kick.

They hardly had a shot either, barely registering an effort after a half-time team talk that excluded Eriksen and Townsend.

Spurs have lost four Premier League home matches in five for the first time since May-October 2008 (Juande Ramos’ last five home PL games as manager).

Spurs 0-3 Liverpool; Spurs 0-1 West Brom; Spurs 1-2 Newcastle; Spurs 1-2 Stoke 

Erik Lamela’s free-kick 15 minutes from time brought a flying save from Begovic, launching himself to the left to turn it around the post.

Chadli gave them hope when he picked the ball out of the air to beat the keeper with an angled volley, but the dismissal of Naughton confirmed the worst.

Adebayor wasted a chance when he head wide of Begovic’s post and Kane’s desperate attempts to repeat his last minute free-kick against Villa last week was drilled straight at the wall.

That was enough for Klinsmann and the rest of the US Soccer delegation to make their excuses and leave.

Whether he can face returning is another matter.
