One cold night in February 1949 a supper party was held in Erith, Kent, to introduce the newly-selected Conservative party candidate for Dartford to some of the local bourgeoisie. The Tory candidate was the soft-cheeked, hawk-nosed Margaret Roberts.

Perfect political spouse: Sir Denis and Baroness Thatcher in 2003 a few months before Denis passed away

Among the guests was the managing director of the Atlas Preservative Company, which had diversified out of weedkiller and sheep-dip and was now making good money manufacturing paint.

The man from Atlas, bespectacled, balding, rich and raffish, was the war hero, amateur rugby referee and divorcé Denis Thatcher. He had seen Miss Roberts in full flow at the selection meeting and he was impressed, in more than one way.

So, it turned out, was she. They married in 1951, at Wesley’s Chapel in City Road, London. Denis, who would remain her steadfast, cheerful, shrewd companion until his death in June 2003, proved the perfect political husband. That is to say he had no political ambition of his own and managed never to cause her problems.

At the end of each long, lonely day she served as Prime Minister he would hand her a whisky and offer a friendly ear to the wife he fondly addressed as ‘old girl’.

‘When I’m in a state,’ she said, ‘I have no one to turn to except Denis. He puts his arm round me and says “Darling, you sound just like Harold Wilson”. And then I always laugh.’

For more than half a century he was at Margaret’s side, from the day she entered Downing Street (photographs caught him standing, smart white hanky in his top pocket, in the doorway to No 10 while she gave her St Francis of Assisi spiel to the TV cameras) to the day she left in tears, Denis next to her in the back of the official Daimler.

When Margaret flew to international summits, Denis would usually be somewhere in the background, bringing a touch of the Surrey golf club bar to whatever exotic destination they’d flown to. Snapshots normally caught him standing at a slight angle, snaggle teeth and spectacles reflecting the glare of the camera flashbulbs.

Denis saw her through good (the election victories) and bad (the Brighton bomb — not to mention all those times when it seemed that the whole British political Establishment was plotting to unseat her).

He was the constant element in a turbulent premiership, never complaining, frequently cheering her up with some pungent put-down of a hated rival. Oh, to know what he made of Geoffrey Howe! And oh, to have been a fly on the wall when he and that other remarkable consort, the Duke of Edinburgh, neither versed in political correctness, got together at Balmoral while their wives were seeing to matters of state.

When they had first met in 1949, Denis was arguably a cut or two above his new wife in rank, having come into money. 

Long-lasting marriage: Denis and Margaret Thatcher on their wedding day in 1951

The courtship was conducted at some of London’s better restaurants — the Ecu de France in Jermyn Street and the White Tower just north of Oxford Street. He drove her around town in a Jaguar.

On Christmas Day 1949, he gave her an expensive present of a crystal powder bowl with a silver top. She treasured it for ever. Maybe Denis’s smartish background helped to stiffen Margaret’s resolve in 1981 when she stood up to the drawling, sneering snoots of her first Cabinet. Denis was not one to be browbeaten by hair-oiled humbugs from the old-boys’ club.

He knew their type, not least from the rugby clubs, and he would have told Margaret firmly to remember that she was the boss.

She duly sacked several of her Cabinet enemies, replacing them with truer believers in her politics of aspiration and merit.

‘For 40 years,’ he said in 1991, ‘I have been married to the greatest woman the world has ever produced. All I could produce — small as it may be — was love and loyalty.’

Denis brought normality, humour and non-negotiable love to her years in high office. He gave her financial stability and emotional resilience. He provided the domestic guy ropes without which her whole tent might have collapsed.

And he did it with such humour. One of his favourite expressions, when describing some political character, was to say that so-and-so was ‘as much use as a one-legged man in an arse-kicking contest’. With such turns of phrase, he was able to shake his wife out of her darkest moods.

‘Better keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool rather than open it and remove all doubt,’ Denis reportedly said another time. He knew that as the husband of such a controversial figure he could cause her political trouble, and so he created for himself the image of a bumbling boozer.

Supportive: Margaret Thatcher getting a kiss from Denis after she had come out on top in the first round of the election for the Conservative party leadership

Margaret certainly never saw him as this chumpish caricature. You only have to read her account of the 1949 Denis — ‘he had a penchant for fast cars and he simply knew more about the world than I did’ — to see that she always looked up to him.

It is sometimes said that sensible women look for a husband like their father. Margaret’s father had been the stalwart alderman Alfred Roberts, grocer and mayor of Grantham.

Denis, being ten years older than Margaret and already experienced in the world (with all that entailed), was certainly a father figure in some ways. And was there not something selflessly parental in the way he devoted himself to her during those years of astonishing political service?

Presented with the question ‘who wears the trousers in your marriage?’, Denis replied happily: ‘I do. I also wash them and iron them.’ His wife’s political duties came first. End of story. Asked what the role of a political spouse was, Denis replied that it was to be ‘always present, never there’. He perfectly understood the need for omnipresent discretion.

Was Sir Denis disconsolate at having lost the keys to Downing Street? Was he heck. A reporter asked if he would miss being garlanded at the next Tory party conference.

He practically exploded with laughter. ‘Thank goodness I don’t have to go to the bloody thing,’ he said. ‘I have a business to run. I still have to make a living.’

And when, at the age of 77, he received treatment for cancer, some ‘reptile’ (as he called members of the Press) approached him at Heathrow. How was Sir Denis proposing to recuperate, asked the newshound. Sir Denis lifted his bag of Duty Free purchases and replied: ‘Gin and cigarettes!’

Perhaps we can comfort ourselves that in Heaven last night, as Margaret Thatcher walked through St Peter’s pearly gates, she’ll have been met by a familiar, snaggle-toothed smile and a hug from her beloved husband with the words: ‘There you are, old girl. Whatever kept you? Now, how about a good, strong whisky?’
