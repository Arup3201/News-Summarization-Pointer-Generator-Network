He has millions of female fans and it seems that Harry Styles has been taking style inspiration from them.

The One Direction singer, who just jetted back from his US tour, reportedly took advantage of his time in the States by stocking up on women's jeans.

A source told the Daily Star Sunday that 20-year-old Harry was seen perusing the ladies jeans in Paige Denim in Beverley Hills.

'He went straight for the women's ranges. Harry's favourites are the skinny women's jeans in size 30 and then men's jeans in size 28,' said the source.

'Of the two, he says he prefers the women's because they are the tightest.'

Harry apparently loves the black and grey versions of the Paige jeans, which have fast become a celebrity favourite.

Good taste: Harry apparently loves the black and grey versions of the jeans, which he has been stocking up on during his tour of the States with One Direction this month

And it seems that money is no object for the star, who is worth a reported £20m. Harry apparently snapped up four pairs of women's jeans, as well as two pairs of men's. 

The star has such a love affair with the brand that he even splurged £551 on a pair of women's black leather Edgemont jeans.

Established by founder and creative director Paige Adams-Geller in Los Angeles in  2005, Paige's designs became an instant hit with celebrities such as Sarah Jessica Parker, Olivia Palermo and Miranda Kerr, as well as prominent fashion editors.

They range in price from £175 all the way up to £900 for a pair of leather trousers. 

After graduating from USC, the former Miss California became a fashion industry muse, transitioning from modeling to a career behind the seams and her namesake designs are now sold at Net-a-Porter and in Selfridges with IT girl Rosie Huntington-Whiteley serving as the face of her brand.

Speaking about Harry's fashion choice, fashion writer Simon Glazin said: 'It's nice to know he’s investing in clothes, but honestly Harry, if your jeans get any tighter, you’ll almost certainly develop a bad case of thrush. Or at least stop the circulation to some of your vitals.

'Men’s skinny jeans are bad enough - some are verging on meggings territory, but women’s jeans are cut differently: to support a bottom and fit hips, of which Harry has neither. And what’s more, I’m sure no women find it sexy that HER jeans look better on HIM. Those twiglet legs do nothing for the opposite sex.

'Surely he can find some decent denim made for men? I do believe that super skin tight, spray on jeans are slowly dying out (thank God), so now might be a good time for Harry to try a new cut. Unsightly camel toe on women is bad enough, if Harry continues with his ladies jeans, we’re sure to see the male equivalent sooner or later!'
