Furious passengers stranded on a Ryanair flight called police from the tarmac after being left for hours without food or drink.

More than 100 travellers, including children, had already faced a long wait to board the delayed flight from Stansted to Porto in Portugal. Three hours later, the plane was still on the ground.

Tired and hungry, they asked flight attendants for food and water but were refused.

Row: A police officer boarded the Ryanair plane at Stansted Airport after passengers were left waiting on the tarmac for three hours. Their flight to Porto eventually took off 11 hours late

Frustration soon turned to anger, 
with mutinous passengers confronting cabin crew and many phoning police.
 One passenger claimed up to 50 calls were made.

Officers
 finally boarded the plane and passengers were allowed to get off and 
wait in the airport terminal. By this time, they had spent more than 
three hours on the jet without refreshments.

The plane finally took off after a mammoth 11-hour delay.

Anger: Passengers stand on the plane in the early hours of last Saturday morning. They were eventually allowed back into the terminal building at 3.45am

Anger: Passengers on the Ryanair flight protested that they were left without food or water - and were not even offered the chance to buy it

Police response: Officers arranged for the passengers to be allowed back into the terminal building

Delays: Passengers on the Ryanair flight wait inside the Stansted terminal last Friday before they were called onto the plane for the first time. In total, they faced 11 hours of delays

The
 drama comes weeks after Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary pledged to treat 
passengers better and ‘stop p****** people off unnecessarily’.

Flight 
FR8347 had been due to take off at 8.25pm last Friday but when the 
passengers checked in for the two-hour 20 minute flight, they were told 
there were delays because of adverse weather.

They waited nearly four 
hours before they boarded the plane just after midnight.

8.30pm - Friday February 14 - Ryanair flight from Stansted to Porto was due to take off but passengers are told there are delays because of adverse

10.25pm - The flight is delayed because the plane had to stop to refuel in Birmingham

11.45pm - Passengers are told to go to the gate.

12.15am - Saturday February 15 - Passengers board the plane and face a long wait

3am - They are still on the plane

3.25am - Police board the plane and agree to help the passengers get off

3.45am - 'Police break into the terminal building' which has closed and let the passengers in

6am - Passengers are told to get back on the plane as it prepares to take-off

8am - The plane finally departs for Porto 11 hours late

That
 was when their real ordeal began. Passenger João Pinheiro posted a 
video diary of the scenes on You Tube, which has since received nearly 
500,000 views.

In the 
video, passengers can be seen begging the cabin crew for assistance. 
‘There is nothing to eat or drink,’ one man shouts to a male steward. 
‘You are ignoring your passengers who are asking for help. Aren’t you 
flight attendants? Is everybody crazy?’

A
 woman passenger says: ‘You won’t let us eat or drink even if we pay? We
 can’t leave the aircraft either?’ Another pleads: ‘There is a baby on 
board.’ The video claims the passengers asked for food, water and for 
the air conditioning to be turned on at 1am, but that this was refused.

A
 police car with flashing lights can be seen outside the aircraft before
 an officer boards and tells passengers they will be allowed to  leave 
the plane.

After the video 
emerged, Ryanair issued an apology but claimed that passengers had been 
given water on the plane and said the captain had also called the police
 for assistance.

Last
 night a spokesman for Swissport said: ‘Swissport staff were under 
extreme pressure dealing with an unprecedented level of flights and 
whilst we accept we should have unloaded the passengers sooner we simply
 had no one available to unload when contacted by the captain. Swissport
 regret any delay to passengers and to Ryanair.’

A Ryanair spokesman said “due to strong winds across the South of England (14 Feb) over 20 other airlines' aircraft were forced to divert into Stansted from Heathrow Airport, and this significantly impacted operations at Stansted. 

This Ryanair flight from London Stansted to Porto was delayed due to this and was then further delayed due to a fuelling issue at the airport. Passengers on this flight were disembarked and provided with refreshment vouchers. 

The aircraft departed the following morning at 7.50am. Ryanair sincerely apologised to all passengers affected by these adverse weather delays, which were outside of our control. With this flight and every flight, we always work hard to get our customers to their destination.”

Flight: The short flight to Porto from Stansted should usually take just two hours 20 minutes

Disembark: Passengers are allowed off the plane at 3.45am last Saturday morning - but they were told to get back on around two hours later

Terminal delays: Passengers wait inside the terminal building at around 4am - their flight eventually took off four hours later after an 11-hour delay

Loudmouth Ryanair businessman Michael O'Leary promised to 'stop unnecessarily p****** passengers off' after profits slumped last year.

His budget airline are famed for charging low fares but bringing in extra revenue by hitting flyers with extortionate charges to put a bag in the hold.

Other passengers have been hit with sky-high charges at the airport for failing to print off their boarding passes at home.

Hauled off: A Ryanair passenger is led off a flight in Valencia, Spain, by the police because she was carrying the wrong sort of hand luggage

In one incident, Spanish police hauled a woman off a plane in Valencia, Spain, before it took off because she had the 'wrong type of hand luggage'.

Spanish newspapers said she was judged to have broken the airline’s rule of boarding with only a small package because she was carrying a scroll, which would not fit in her case, and a book.

Footage of the incident in 2012 shows the Spanish woman begging to be let on board
as other passengers shout 'shameful, shameful'.

Last month, furious French Ryanair passengers launched a revolt and stole from the drink trolley after being faced with 24-hour delay following an emergency landing.

Their plane to Paris took off from Rabat, in Morocco, before being forced to land in Madrid because of a medical emergency.

It was too late for the flight to land in Paris because of night restrictions by the time it took off again - so the plane stopped in Nantes instead. Passengers were put on a bus to their destination the next day.

In May last year, a Ryanair flight was diverted 200 miles to another airport away from its Greek holiday island destination because the pilot said it was 'too dark to land'.

The flight from London Stansted to Kefalonia landed at Thessaloniki airport on the Greece mainland instead as a result of the problems. Eventually it flew on to its destination after a two-hour delay.
