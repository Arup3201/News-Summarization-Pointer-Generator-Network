It is very unusual to see fans chanting the name of an opposition player at a football match. But then again, it is rare to see a player of Neymar's talent.

Brazil played a friendly against Turkey on Wednesday night, and the Barcelona forward was at his brilliant best. While Messi shone at Upton Park, his team-mate was on the other side of Europe scoring two goals in Istanbul.

Picking up the ball with the score at three-nil, Neymar played a neat one-two, before driving into the Turkey box, dropping a shoulder to take himself away from the centre-back.

A side-foot finish put the ball in the back of the net, and Turkey were resigned to a 4-0 loss against Brazil - Neymar scoring the first and last.

After he secured his brace, even the home fans were on their feet. 'Neymar, Neymar' came the cries from the Istanbul faithful. 

Onlookers with Turkish shirts and flags were applauding the pure brilliance of the 22-year-old, who has already scored 42 goals for his country.

In the aftermath of a disappointing World Cup, it is up to their poster-boy and captain to resurrect the fortunes of the national team. And he certainly looks to be doing so, helping Brazil to five successive wins under the stewardship of Dunga.
