Retired Britons get £600-a-year less than those in America because of EU red tape strangling people's pension pots, research has revealed.

OAPs in the UK can expect a pay out of around £2,850 a year from a £50,000 retirement pot. But in the States, pensioners with the same size nest egg will get £3,450.

Pension experts say this £50-a-month gulf is because EU financial regulation is twice as strict as that in the States.

A British pensioner with a £50,000 retirement pot would receive £2,850-a-year, but in the US a pensioner with the same size nest egg would get £3,450

EU rules force British insurance companies to hold twice as much cash in reserve compared to those in the US - driving down the amount they can pay out in annuities to pensioners.

Because the regulation forces shareholders in UK pension companies  to put more cash on the line as an insurance policy, the shareholders demand more profit in return - eating in to people's retirement incomes.

UK insurers  demand a profit margin of around 20 per cent on annuities. In the US meanwhile, insurers generally look for a return of just 10 per cent.

An annuity is what most people in the UK choose to spend their pension savings on at retirement.

Pensioners hand over your pension fund to an insurer - who have to pay back a guaranteed income for life in return. In 2013 around 400,000 annuities were sold worth £12billion.

Insurers generally work on the assumption they will have to pay a 65-year-old a pension until they are 90.

From a retirement pot of £100,000, insurers work out that they will make around £55,000-£60,000 by investing this cash over 25 years.

From this, pensioners will get an annual income of around £5,700-£5,900 — which works out at up to £148,000 over 25 years.

This means £12,000 is left over. Of this, £5,500 goes on overheads and middle men - with the remaining £6,500 in profit for the insurance company.

But insurance companies will make much more than £6,500 on average - because most people don't live until they are 90.

A healthy 65-year-old is likely to live until they're 84, official figures show. This effectively gives insurers six years of extra profit.

Someone who passes away at 84 could receive as little as £94,000 from their £100,000 retirement pot, leaving insurers with around £30,000 in profits, according to experts.

New rules come into force next year which give pensioners much more freedom over how they spend their pension pots.

People should even be free to blow their pensions on buying a Lamborghini if they want to, pensions minister Steve Webb has said.

The centrepiece of the Government's March Budget was a plan to allow people to withdraw their pension pot as a cash lump sum instead of investing in a pension plan, which ministers claim will give people choice to spend their money how they wish.

In the US peoples have total freedom on how to spend their pension savings - forcing annuity providers to pay out more to encourage pensioners to choose their product.

In the UK the best annuity rate was £5,700 a year for every £100,000 invested. But in the US, pensioners could get $6,900 a year for $100,000 invested.

This is some 20 per cent more paid to pensioners in the US than in the UK.

Alan Higham Retirement Director at Fidelity said: 'Regulators need to explain to the public why they build in so much higher "health & safety" requirements to UK at pensioners' expense compared to the USA.

'From April 2015, pensioners can vote with their wallet and at these poor prices, I cannot see many choosing to buy annuities.'

Pensions Minister Steve Webb said: 'For many years consumers have felt that they were not getting good value from their annuities.

'But from next April people will be free to do what they want with their pension pot.

'No one will be forced to buy an annuity and if someone thinks they can get a better return through an alternative way of using their pension pot then this Government will not stand in their way.'

Pensions minister Steve Webb has introduced new rules to give pensioners more freedom over how they spend their retirement savings

Former Downing Street pensions adviser Dr Ros Altmann warned told MailOnline that British pensioners were losing out.

Former Saga chief Dr Altmann said: 'UK pensioners are being royally ripped off. In the US you can choose whether you want to buy an annuity or not. But companies here have a captive audience because they have to buy an annuity.

'I think it is essential that people take advice before looking into an annuity and that they shop around. The evidence is clear when you look other countries - they are much better rates.'

Labour’s Shadow Pensions Minister Gregg McClymont MP added: 'Annuities as they stand do not work for the majority of savers– low and middle income savers with smaller pension pots.

'We support more options for savers, but the quality of financial guidance savers receive is paramount.

'George Osborne promised and must deliver high quality impartial face to face guidance for the hundreds of thousands of savers who retire annually. The devil is in the detail when it comes to the Chancellor’s Guidance Guarantee.'

Annuity rates have been on the wane for the past 15 years and are now at an all-time low

WHAT IS AN ANNUITY?

If you belong to a non-final salary pension scheme, by the time you retire you will have built up a lump sum in your personal pension pot.

This may be used to buy an annuity from an insurance firm, which guarantees a specified annual income for the rest of your life.

How much you receive is based on life expectancy and government interest rates.

WHAT CAN I EXPECT TO GET?

Someone aged 65 with a £50,000 pot can expect around £2,850 a year. But in the States, pensioners with the same amount will get £3,450.

WHY ARE PAYMENTS SO POOR?

Annuity rates have fallen steadily for the past 15 years because of increased life expectancy. The longer we live, the longer our pension pots will have to support us.

More recently the Bank of England’s policy of quantitative easing has led to a drop in the interest paid on Government bonds. 

Because insurers use the yield on these bonds to set annuity rates, pension payouts have fallen steeply.

WHAT TYPES OF ANNUITY ARE THERE?

The simplest, and most common, offers a fixed income for life, with no inflation proofing and no provision for a surviving spouse.

Once you take an annuity your entire pension pot is gone. If you die a year later, the income stops and your family will not get access to savings you had.

Annuities for the chronically sick and smokers can be up to 40 per cent higher than normal because they have shorter life expectancies.
