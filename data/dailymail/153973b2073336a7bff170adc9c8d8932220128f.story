A former county supervisor and the estranged wife of California's Treasurer has been arrested after police found methamphetamine stashed in the Orange County home she was living in with the couple's nine-year-old son.

Nadia Lockyer, 41, was until recently considered a rising star in Northern California government with her career being helped along by her powerful politician husband of ten years Bill Lockyer, 71.

But she is now facing charges of drug possession and child abuse, in the latest in a string of public substance abuse and relationship struggles faced by the woman.

Mr Lockyer, the state's former attorney general and current treasurer, helped his much younger wife with $1.6million in campaign funding when she won her supervisor seat in 2010, but has since filed for divorce and is seeking joint custody of their son.

She resigned from the seat in April following a series of bizarre public incidents that she blamed on drug and alcohol dependency.

According to the San Jose Mercury News, she said at the time she wanted to focus on her family and resolve personal issues.

Mrs Lockyer said at the time: 'We're married. There's no talk of changing that. We're committed to our son.'

The sordid details of the political 
power couple began to leak out in February when Mrs Lockyer called 
police to a hotel where she was staying to report that she had been 
assaulted by her former lover, a convicted felon whom she met in rehab 
for addiction.

A police investigation revealed an 
ongoing relationship between Mrs Lockyer and construction worker Steve 
Chikhani, including explicit text messages and pictures sent between the
two but he was never charged.

Mr Lockyer was also reportedly sent a sex tape of his wife and lover and Mrs Lockyer revealed that they had been together for a year before she ended the relationship.

Mr Lockyer filed for divorce in July,
citing 'irreconcilable differences' in the legal papers and just hours 
after being served, Mrs Lockyer ran her car off the road and hit a tree.

Police received a tip last week that 
led them to a house where Mrs Lockyer was staying with relatives, 
district attorney's spokeswoman Farrah Emami said.

The woman was not home, but officers 
found methamphetamine and paraphernalia used for smoking it. Later, when
they found Mrs Lockyer, she showed 'objective signs' of meth 
intoxication and she was arrested.

Mrs Lockyer pleaded not guilty in 
court on August 30 to a felony count of drug possession, two misdemeanor
drug charges and one misdemeanor count of child abuse, because she is 
alleged to have kept the drugs in the home with her son.

She was released after acknowledging she needed to check in to a drug rehab centre and is due back in court on Monday.

'Nadia recognizes her error and is in
the process of doing everything possible to regain her health,' said 
her attorney, Allan Stokke.

Mrs Lockyer had made various accusations in the past of abandonment by her husband and that the divorce had been coming for some time.

According to theÂ San Francisco Chronicle she said at the time of their divorce: 'My husband and I have differed on how to protect the family,' she said.

'I feel he has abandoned me and my child, and it's created an unsafe circumstance.'

Even before her resignation from office, Mrs Lockyer publicly accused her husband of mistreatment.

An email that appeared to be sent from Mrs Lockyer went to a newspaper, accusing her husband of supplying her with drugs, a claim he denies.

'I simply can't bear this any longer. Goodbye to everyone,' the note read, prompting the paper to call police, fearing for her safety.

At the time, Mrs Lockyer said, 'Alcoholism and addiction are diseases from which many of us suffer, and unfortunately, I have not been spared.'

She later denied having sent the email and said Mr Chikhani hacked her account. However, a technology expert found the email was sent from Mrs Lockyer's phone and Mr Chikhani's lawyer said his client was at a highly controlled drug rehab facility with only supervised computer access at the time.

A spokesman for Mr Lockyer denied the accusation, saying it was 'BS.'

When the the couple wed in 2003, Mrs Lockyer she was four years younger than Mr Lockyer's daughter from a previous marriage. However, they immediately became a political power couple.

She was the daughter of a well-known Los Angeles-area lawyer and she had made a name for herself working on political campaigns in Orange County.
