Clive Mantle (pictured with Casualty co-star Jane Gurnett) broke down today as he recalled the moment his ear was bitten off

A former Casualty star had part of his ear bitten off after asking two fellow hotel guests to keep the noise down, a court heard.

Clive Mantle, 56, had been woken in the early hours of the morning and had left his room twice to ‘request politely’ that two drunks quieten down so he could sleep.

In the violence that followed, Mr Mantle, who was still wearing his pyjamas, lost a ‘substantial part’ of his ear, which ended up on the floor, leaving him permanently disfigured.

He claimed he was worried about defending himself for fear of being prosecuted like Tony Martin – the farmer convicted of manslaughter after shooting a burglar dead.

Mr Mantle, who played surgeon Mike Barrett in Casualty and currently plays Lord Umber in Game of Thrones, had been staying at the Travelodge while performing in a play at the Theatre Royal in Newcastle, the court heard.

He was woken at about 4.30am on March 24 last year by Philip McGilvray, 33, and Alan French, 32, who were shouting in the corridor outside his ground-floor room.

Jolyon Perks, prosecuting, told Newcastle Crown Court: ‘They had come down from Scotland with friends and they were out drinking and socialising. At 4.30am in the morning they had reached the stage where they were excessively drunk and had also reached the stage where drink converted them to being raucous and, ultimately, violent.’

The actor, 6ft 5in tall and sporting a large moustache, told the court how the pair were making ‘banshee-like’ noises which woke him up and resulted in him opening his room door.

He said: ‘I cast a fairly strange figure. I had a huge moustache for the part I was playing in the play, with a T-shirt and pyjama bottoms.’ He asked the men to keep the noise down as he was trying to sleep – but the noise soon started up again.

He said: ‘Male one was encouraging male two to “come and look at the old man in his pyjamas”.’

Mr Mantle, who has since grown his hair to cover the injury, said it was a ‘sport’ to them and he could hear ‘wailing and laughter’ from the men. Hearing more noise, he went to his door and warned he was going to call security but there was not a phone in his room.

He was on his way to the Quayside hotel reception, walking barefoot, when the pair laid into him, the jury heard.

Mr Perks said: ‘As he approached, the two defendants deliberately blocked his path.

‘He told them he needed to get past and placed his hands between them, and tried to force his way through, perhaps not unreasonably considering the situation he was in.

‘At this point they both decided to grab his arms and set about him. Both men threw a flurry of drunken punches, some landed, some didn’t. Ultimately, it ended with him being dragged on the ground face down.’

Mr Mantle told the court: ‘I think in total there were about 15 blows, of which only four hurt.’

At one point, French was on top of the actor and McGilvray was by his left side.

Fighting back tears, Mr Mantle described how the ‘melee’ turned into his ear being bitten off by McGilvray. He said: ‘The next thing I was aware of was a pain in my left ear which triggered a massive response within me. The adrenaline it gave me enabled me to rip my right hand away.

‘The only thing I could do is put my thumb in his eye socket to make him release.

‘An image of Tony Martin, the guy who shot the intruders in his house, went through my mind. I have got to do enough damage to hurt him but not so much I get prosecuted for poking someone’s eye out – it’s bizarre the thing you think about at times like this.’ It was at this point, he said that his ‘guardian angel’ Alice Klenk, a nurse staying at the hotel with her partner, heard the fighting and came out of her room.

She grabbed one of the defendants by his collar and held the other back with her arm to stop them having another go at Mr Mantle, the jury heard.

The actor said: ‘She saved me from a lot further damage.’

Clive Mantel says he was woken up by Philip McGilvray, 33, and Alan French, 32, who were shouting in his hotel corridor last March

After staggering to his feet, he saw there was blood all over him. He said: ‘I looked down and there was my ear lying on the carpet.’

He picked up his ear and grabbed one of the men, but the pair managed to flee and Mr Mantle returned to his room with Miss Klenk, where they put his ear in  a glass of water to preserve it.

The court heard how the two defendants did not return to the hotel for several hours – by which point they had tried to check in to a nearby Premier Inn but were turned away.

McGilvray and French, both from Hamilton, Scotland, deny a charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, and will claim they were acting in self-defence. The case continues.
