A heartless thief mugged an elderly woman and stole her wedding ring while her husband lay on his deathbed in hospital.

Former Shakespeare actress Yvonne Sherwell-Demakopoulos, 85, was coming home from a night out with friends on Saturday when the thug followed her into the elevator of her New York building.

The burly attacker can be seen on surveillance video at around 10.50pm, waving to the woman as if he were a friend, in the lobby of her upmarket apartment block in the Meatpacking District.

Brutal: The thief pushes the elderly woman to the ground after following her into the elevator at her apartment block when she arrived home from an evening out

Callous thief: He hides her handbag in his hoodie while she lies prone on the floor

'He asked for [a resident] by their name, and I didn’t recognize it,' she said. 'I said I would go check, and he followed me into the elevator.

'He was trying to trick me,' she said. 'He got in and pushed me down. I fell on my arm, but luckily my coat is like a blanket.'

The mugger then demanded that the woman hand over her black bag, before noticing the wedding ring, she said yesterday.

'My hand was out, and he saw it. He took it off me. I said, "Please, it’s my wedding ring." He took it - dirty dog.

'It was Greek. It was an heirloom,' she said of the ring. 'It belonged to my husband’s great-grandmother. [The robber] won’t get much for it, but it meant... the world to me.'

Sneaky: Just seconds earlier, he was captured on surveillance video waving at Yvonne Sherwell-Demakopoulos in the lobby of her apartment block, as if he were a neighbour

Premeditated: The attacker even pretended to sit down while the woman - whose husband was in hospital - called the elevator

Mrs Sherwell-Demakopoulos said her husband Christos, 80, is in a nursing home after having a massive stroke last month. He also suffers from Parkinson’s disease and is in his last days, she said.

'I was indulging myself that night with friends because I was so upset with my husband being in the hospital,' she said.

The couple have been together for about 20 years, and married for nine years, according to the New York Post.

'We met at the local bar, where else?' she added. 'It was a corner bistro. He was a widower, I was a widow — we were Village friends for a long time.

'He took me to a cabaret and then the Metropolitan Room.'

After being robbed, the victim called her daughter, Candela Prol.

'She was hysterical,' said her daughter. 'She said, "I was mugged, and he took my wedding ring!" That’s when she really started to cry.'

Mrs Sherwell-Demakopoulos, who moved to New York from Waterbury, Connecticut, at the age of 19, said that as a longtime New Yorker, she has been mugged before.

'It’s New York,' the octogenarian shrugged.

But she added: 'Wouldn’t that be neat if they caught him? It’s just unbelievable all this horror happens at the same time.'
