The family of Marvin Gaye has won a round in a court battle over allegations that last year's blockbuster hit song 'Blurred Lines' ripped off the late Motown legend's work.

A US federal judge denied a motion today by singer Robin Thicke and songwriter Pharrell Williams, who wanted a court to reject the plagiarism claims made by Gaye's children.

A jury will decide their accusations that the 2012 hit song 'Blurred Lines' wrongly copied parts of their father's music in a celebrity trial set for February.

U.S. District Judge John A. Kronstadt made the ruling after hearing views by experts for Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams, and by Gaye's children, over 'Blurred Lines' and Gaye's 'Got to Give it Up'. 

The federal judge said there was a good argument about whether signature phrases, hooks, bass lines, keyboard chords and vocal melodies in the two songs are the same.

But Kronstadt said the jury will not listen to the music, but compare the sheet music.

An attorney for Thicke and Pharrell said he was 'confident' the pair would win the upcoming trial.

The ruling today came after a court fight that has lasted more than a year.

Thicke and Pharrell had sought a motion on Thursday by the judge that 'Blurred Lines' did not infringe on copyrights to the Gaye song.

Their attorney, Howard King, wrote in an email that the judge's decision was not a surprise, and he was confident the hit songwriters would win at trial.

'Since the compositions at issue are completely different, we remain confident of prevailing at trial,' King wrote.

A representative for Gaye's children, Nona, Frankie and Marvin Gaye III, did not have an immediate comment on the ruling.

The Gaye family also claims that 'After the Dance' was improperly used for Thicke's No. 1 R&B hit, 'Love After War.' Kronstadt ruled a trial would be needed to decide that issue as well.

The Los Angeles trial is scheduled for February 10, 2015.
