Tory ministers are furious at the posters erected by Labour-run Lambeth council

A Labour council has provoked outrage with an advertising campaign warning benefit claimants that cuts will mean they ‘may have to find work’.

Lambeth Council has spent hundreds of pounds of taxpayers’ money on 50 posters and an online advert opposing Coalition cuts in welfare.

Ministers said it was evidence that Labour believes welfare claimants should be entitled to sit on state benefits without bothering to go to work.

The advert, displayed on Lambeth’s website, features a giant pair of scissors slicing through a pound sign.

It reads: ‘The government are making cuts to benefits. If you claim benefits, it is likely you will receive less and may have to find work or move to a different property.’

It then encourages claimants to contact the town hall’s benefits support team who ‘can help make sure you are getting all you are allowed to claim’.

The Tories last night reported the council to the local government ombudsman for the abuse of taxpayers’ money.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘A poster like this suggesting that finding work is a worst-case scenario shows how out of touch Labour are.’

Council leader Lib Peck said it ‘has a duty to provide information, support and advice to its residents’.

Tory local government minister Brandon Lewis said the authority had been ‘caught-red handed systematically misusing public funds’.

From April, no household will be able to receive more than £26,000 in benefits – the average family income.

Housing benefit rules are being changed so claimants will not receive full help with council tax bills if they have unoccupied bedrooms and many benefits will rise by only one per cent.

But ministers condemned the use of public money to criticise government spending cuts.

Mr Lewis said: ‘Lambeth have once again been caught-red handed systematically misusing public funds.

‘The money wasted on this scare campaign could have been spent on protecting frontline services,’ he told the Standard.

Two years ago Lambeth attracted similar criticism when it produced a series of posters saying: ‘The government has cut our money so we are forced to cut services."

Council leader Lib Peck defended the latest publicity drive, insisting it had cost only £600. ‘We are determined to do everything within our power to alert Lambeth residents to the government’s benefit cuts and provide support and advice to local people on managing their finances and opportunities to find jobs and training.'

The row comes after Labour policy chief Jon Cruddas warned his party had to stop being seen as the defender of welfare handouts if it wants to win the next election.

Labour policy chief Jon Cruddas warned Labour had become fixated with welfare payouts not solving people's problems

In
a speech to the Left-wing Resolution Foundation think tank last night, 
he said the party had become fixated with offering tax credits 
and benefit payments to the less well-off rather than dealing with their
wider problems.

He also 
revealed that Labour may not come forward with any concrete policies 
until 2014, when his review enters its ‘second phase’.

Mr
Cruddas, who is drawing up policies for Labour’s next manifesto, said 
the party had ‘stripped down what we think people want into a series of 
fiscal transfers, often administered by a remote bureaucracy – a 
transactional culture’.

He 
said Labour policy had become ‘an exercise in fiscal transfers without a
deeper story of earning respect and a place in society’.

He suggested the party should now focus on promoting ‘earning and belonging’ rather than just handing people money.

‘The
emphasis has to shift from demands exclusively built around simple 
state expenditure toward interventions and campaigns that bring people 
together and enable them to improve their common life,’ he said.

‘That
will be the future. The money is not there to rewind this. Nor should 
we wish to do so and simply defend and back pass to the state.’

His
comments are a direct challenge to Mr Miliband who has campaigned 
against every attempt by the Coalition to cut the bloated welfare budget
left behind by the last Labour government.
