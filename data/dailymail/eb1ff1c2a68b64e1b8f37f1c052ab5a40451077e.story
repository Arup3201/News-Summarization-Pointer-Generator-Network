Daley Blind could face several weeks on the sidelines after suffering a medial ligament injury in Holland’s 6-0 win over Latvia.

In the latest blow to Manchester United, Blind went down in the 19th minute at the Amsterdam ArenA after Eduards Visnakovs landed on his knee. Blind's is the 39th United injury since Louis van Gaal took charge in July - that's an average of one injury every three days.

Blind was able to limp off unaided but Holland manager Guus Hiddink said his ligament could be twisted and possibly ruptured.

Dutch TV scaled down this diagnosis to a ‘small tear’, saying Blind will likely miss four-six weeks.

A full MRI scan on Monday will reveal the full extent of the damage but it looks as though Blind will be out until the New Year.

Blind took to Instagram to confirm the news of his injury saying: 'I'm proud of my 25 games for the Dutch national team, but I'm so gutted with my injury... I'll stay positive and will come back stronger! Nevertheless a great win, 6-0!'

Hiddink said: ‘I’m am not a doctor, but I’m rather negative. His medial ligament is twisted and there might be a rupture as well. There will be a full MRI scan tomorrow.’

It is just the latest injury blow for United boss Louis van Gaal, who is already without a number of key personnel.

Goalkeeper David De Gea faces four weeks out after dislocating a finger during training with Spain on Friday. 

Defenders Phil Jones (shin splints), Marcos Rojo (dislocated shoulder), Rafael (muscle problems) and Jonny Evans (ankle) are all on the treatment table.

Midfielder Michael Carrick withdrew from the England squad last week with a groin problem, while Ander Herrera has been struggling with a fractured rib. 

Striker Radamel Falcao has been struggling to overcome a calf problem but could be in contention for Saturday’s trip to Arsenal in the Premier League.

Blind, who joined from Ajax for £13.8m in the summer, has featured in eight matches so far for United and has been one of their most consistent performers.

With Van Gaal’s defence so threadbare, Blind was forced to play at centre half during United’s last match - the 1-0 win over Crystal Palace at Old Trafford last week.

It means Herrera could be rushed back into action at the Emirates, while Tyler Blackett and Patrick McNair could be called upon at centre half. The young players have just 10 Premier League appearances between them.

United are currently seventh in the table, some 13 points adrift of leaders Chelsea, and Blind’s injury will come as another hammer blow.

His withdrawal didn’t affect Holland, who romped to a six-goal win thanks to doubles from Arjen Robben and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and further strikes from Robin van Persie and Jeffrey Bruma

September 12: Versatile defender Phil Jones is ruled out for up to a month with a hamstring injury.

September 21: Defender Jonny Evans suffers a foot injury in a calamitous 5-3 defeat at Leicester, with Smalling replacing him as he made his own return from the groin problem sustained in August. Another defender, Tyler Blackett, is sent off and suspended.

Brazilian full back Rafael misses the match due to injury so winger Antonio Valencia is forced to fill in. United end the match with McNair and midfielder Michael Carrick occupying the central defensive positions.
