An eight-year-old girl has taken on Clarks over its 'sexist' shoes range saying she would rather wear dinosaur trainers than a pair covered in flowers and butterflies.

Sophia Trow took to social media to vent her frustration after being told the Stomp Claw range of dinosaur trainers was for boys only.

She tweeted the multi-national company saying: 'Dear Clarks, I don't like how girls have flowery shoes - I like dinosaurs and fossils, so I think that other girls might as well.'

The eight-year-old from Middlesbrough said she was upset when she was told the specific range, which leaves behind 'awesome' reptilian footprints, was not suitable for female bone structure.

The eight-year-old schoolgirl said she would rather wear dinosaur trainers than a pair covered in flowers and butterflies (pictured shoe from Clarks range)

'I really want dinosaur shoes because they leave footprints in the sand and mud,' she said.

'Clarks should learn what girls really want and do something about it.'

She said she felt like killing anyone who told her she couldn't have or do things 'just because I'm a girl'.

'I don't like how girls just have to like pink and purple - I like blue and science and fossils,' she said. 

Sophia's sentiments are backed by her six-year-old sister Helena and their mother, 34-year-old Jane Trow. 

Ms Trow tweeted Clarks on her daughter's behalf, saying: 'My daughter has written you a letter about your sexist shoes. Not all girls want to be pretty princesses.'

She said young children should be given more choice rather than being prescribed gender-specific toys and clothes. 

'Dinosaur shoes are fun, exciting and something to stomp around and make noise in which is apparently just a boy thing,' she said.

She tweeted the multi-national company and sent a letter asking: 'Why can't girls have dinosaur shoes?'

The eight-year-old  was upset when she was told the specific range, which leaves behind 'awesome' reptilian footprints, was not suitable for female bone structure during a shopping trip 

'Girls' shoes are dainty and flowery while boys' are sturdy and fun - where's the choice?'

She added: 'I want my children to have options - if they want to go down the pretty girl, traditional route and grow up to have a family then I'll be proud.

'If they'd prefer a career, no children or to play with toys that aren't supposed to be for girls then I'm equally as proud.

'I don't want them hampered by expectations that tell them how they should behave as girls - I want them to be able to do whatever they want to do and become strong women.'

A spokeswoman for Clarks said the company offered a wide range of children's shoes to meet 'varied tastes and needs'.

She added: 'We are sorry to hear that our product range didn't suit Sophia's personal tastes.'
