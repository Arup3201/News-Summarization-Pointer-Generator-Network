An art fan who unwittingly bought two paintings by street artist Banksy in Central Park for just $60 each is expected to receive a $160,000 windfall when the prints go up for auction.

As part of his month-long New York City residency last October, the elusive graffiti artist foxed even his most ardent fans by secretly selling authentic artworks one Saturday afternoon.

The art fan, who hasn’t been named, purchased two of the signed spray-painted prints entitled Pooh Bear and Kids With Guns.

The buyer recently approached auction house Bonham’s in London with the intention of selling the prints to the highest bidder.

A representative for the auction house told The Guardian that they are expected to fetch roughly $65,000 and $95,000, respectively.

During his month-long residency in New York City last October, Banksy vowed to produce one piece of street art each day.

On the 13th day of his residency, the UK-based artist displayed dozens of original, signed canvases at a pop-up stall attended by an unknown man.

Surprising: For his 13th day in New York, Banksy pulled a fantastic prank by setting up an unannounced art stall with dozens of 100% original signed canvases for $60 each

The stand wasn’t a huge success and after seven hours just three people had bought eight canvases - a total haul of $420.

The
 first sale was at 3.30pm to a woman who bought two canvases for her 
children - and she managed to wrangle a 50 per cent discount.

Half an hour later, a New Zealand woman purchased some art. Video shows the vendor embracing her warmly and kissing her cheek.

At
 5.30pm, a Chicago man rocked up seeking art for his new house: 'I just 
need something for the walls.' He left with four original Banksys.

The day after the sale, Banksy revealed what has happened via his website.

Bemused: The stand was manned by an unknown man who seemed completely uninterested in what he was doing

First customer: The store made its first sale at 3.30pm on Saturday. A woman bought two canvases for her children but negotiated a 50 per cent discount

Sale no. 2:  At 4pm, a woman from New Zealand bought two artworks, to the delight of the merchant

‘Yesterday I set up a stall in the park selling 100 percent authentic original signed Banksy canvases. For $60 each,’ he wrote.

The paintings have since been 'authenticated' by Bansky, a rep from the auction house said.

The art was first thought to be worth $250,000 but that estimate was too high, the rep said.

One of the paintings features an image of Winnie the Pooh sitting under a tree next to a tossed-out honey pot. The other depicts two kids standing on a hillock of guns and bombs.

The art house has not yet set a date for the auction.

Final sale: The last sale of the day was at 6.30pm when a Chicago man rocked up looking for art to decorate his new house. Judging by the big man hug, it must have been an emotional sale

Dismal: The merchant shut up shop at 6.30pm, taking in just $420 after more than six hours on the job
