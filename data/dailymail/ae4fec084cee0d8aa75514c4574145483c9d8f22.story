The sister of an Australian drug smuggler Corby who was released on parole from prison last week has denied claims her sibling attempted suicide in Bali, it has been reported.

Two officials went to the house where she was staying before Schapelle Corby grabbed a knife and threatened to kill herself yesterday, it was claimed.

A source close to the Corby family said that when parole officers visited the house Schapelle was staying in, she expressed frustration at the media intrusion and said to them: 'What, are they waiting for me to kill myself?'

Under pressure: Schapelle Corby's move from from a luxury hotel to her brother-in-law's Balinese house has coincided with depression, anxiety and hallucinations that she is constantly being followed

She was sentenced to 20 years in 
prison in 2005 for smuggling 4.1 kilograms of marijuana into Bali, 
hidden in a boogie board bag.

However
 her sentence was reduced after earning remissions for good behaviour 
along with a five-year cut following an appeal for clemency to the 
Indonesian president.

Last
 night Corby's sister Mercedes denied that she had threatened to 
kill herself, insisting the knife-wielding incident never took place.   

However, a senior official later confirmed that Corby had made a suicide attempt by lunging for a knife but was prevented from doing anything further when her family stopped her.

The head of the corrections division of the Bali Justice office, Mr Sunar Agus, said he had witnessed the dramatic move when he called at the family house in Kuta on Monday evening with a parole officer.

Corby lunged for a knife in what he took to be a suicide attempt.

'I can't tell someone's intention,' he told Fairfax media.

'But what I saw in front of me was that she tried to commit suicide.

'She took a knife, but the family stopped her and the parole officer stopped her,' said Mr Sunar.

Freedom gone sour: Schapelle Corby's moments of joy following her release have turned to fear that Indonesian authorities may revoke her parole and incracerate her again

He did not provide further details but it emerged that Miss Corby had visited the parole board office the 
morning after the alleged suicide attempt for her first monthly report 
and according to parole officer Ketut Sukiati 'her condition was fine.'

Corby, 36, is believed to have 
been told that her parole could be revoked after a documentary was shown
 in Australia on Sunday evening about her release from jail.

Under
 her parole conditions she was warned against giving any interviews 
following speculation that she had struck a million dollar deal with 
Australia's Channel Seven TV network.

Justice Minister, Amir Syamsuddin, said he would make a decision within days.

The incident is certain to be taken very seriously by the Indonesian 
government after Mr Sunar said he had reported it to Jakarta.

Corby's jump for joy (above) following her release has now given way to a suicide attempt, confirmed her her sister Merecdes's husband, Wayan, who is also Schapelle's parole guarantor

In
 words that strongly suggest Corby's parole is to be revoked, 
Justice Minister Amir said he was irritated with the drug smuggler and 
her family and there was now a 'probability' that her parole would be 
'reconsidered'.

He told the Indonesian newspaper Kompas that if he revoked parole it would largely be the fault of her family.

'I
 am waiting for a complete report from the Bali Corrections Board and in
 the meantime I'd like to announce that there's a possibility I will 
revoke Corby's parole,' he told Fairfax Media.

Little more than three weeks after her release (above) Schapelle may have her hard won freedom cut short, as Indonesian authorities decide 'within days' about whether to return her to jail

It
 is understood that a number of Indonesian politicians who have seen the
 documentary have insisted on her bail being revoked, claiming that the 
Corby family had tried to 'sneak' around the law.

Corby was seen earlier today checking into a police station under her bail conditions.

She has checked out of a luxury villa where she was initially staying and has moved into her brother-in-law's home.

In
 the documentary she was shown being whisked away from jail in a van and
 later swimming in the surf before enjoying a meal with her family.

But while Corby did not give an 
interview, her sister Mercedes told how her younger sister had been 
broken by her time in jail.

Footage captured her driving away from prison on Feburary 10 when was released.

She could be heard saying: 'Nice one, driver. Woo hoo!'

The clip also shows Schapelle arriving at the Sentosa Seminyak resort, the luxury villa she is staying in as a parolee.

She
 is seen jumping up and down with excitement before a male voice is 
heard saying, ‘You can take that thing off,’ referring to the scarf 
across her face that perplexed viewers across Australia.

She then removes the tartan veil, though keeps her hat on.

Schapelle
 is seen excitedly greeting her family, including sister Mercedes and 
brother-in-law Wayan, and hugging her niece and nephew.
