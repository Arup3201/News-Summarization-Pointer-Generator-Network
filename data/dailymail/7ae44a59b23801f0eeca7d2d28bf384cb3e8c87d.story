Five children have perished in a massive fire that destroyed their mobile home - but their parents and little brother managed to escape.

The children's father, Johnny Hernandez Jr., 30, was able to push their mother Annabel Ortiz, 32, and two-year-old brother Johnny to safety as the 70-foot mobile home in Edna, Texas was engulfed by flames just after 5am on Tuesday, the Victoria Advocate reported.      

But the fire claimed the lives of the couple's other children: Noah Ortiz, 15, Nicholas Ortiz, 13, Julian Ortiz, nine, Ariana Hernandez, six and Liliana Hernandez, five.

Officials said the children died after the roof of a South Texas mobile home partially collapsed in a fire, making rescue attempts impossible.

Witnesses told Click2Houston that they heard the distraught father shouting 'I tried to get in there! I tried, I tried!' outside the home.

'We're taking it really hard,' the father's brother, Rico Hernandez, told the Advocate. 'It's probably one of the biggest tragedies in Edna, in all around.'

The cause of the fire is being investigated, although authorities have said it appears the flames started in the kitchen.

'It was an old trailer so maybe it was something electrical,' Rico Hernandez told the Advocate. 'I'm guessing it was cold last night so something with the heater.'

Survivors: The children's parents, Johnny Hernandez, 30, and Annabel Ortiz, 32, also survived the fire

Photographs taken of the two- or three-bedroom home on Tuesday show it completely burned down.

By the time emergency services arrived, it was already completely engulfed in flames. 

Ortiz was taken to Citizens Medical Center, where she was listed in fair condition. She was treated for a gash to her arm, which she reportedly sustained when her husband pushed her from a window.

Her husband and their surviving son did not need medical attention.

Hernandez Jr.'s cellphone was found outside the house, the Advocate reported. He had taken photos of his children on Monday night and wanted to make sure he saved the images, his brother said.

Scene: The 70-foot-long home was completely destroyed by the fire that broke out just after 5am

Questions: Authorities are still looking into what caused the fire at the mobile home in Edna, Texas

'All of them were just popular, great kids,' Superintendent Robert O'Connor told The L.A. Times.

'It's devastating anytime you lose a child ... but to lose five at a one time, that is unbelievable.' 

Edna is a town of 5,500 residents about 100 miles southwest of Houston.

The high school, where Noah was a starter for the football team, has canceled upcoming sports games and brought in grief counselors across its campuses.
