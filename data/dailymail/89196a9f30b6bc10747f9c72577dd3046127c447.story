A Catholic priest and a former children's home boss have appeared in court accused of indecently assaulting young boys.

Father Anthony McSweeney, 67, and John Stingemore, 72, are charged with abusing young boys in their care during the 1980s.

Both men are accused of together indecently assaulting a boy under 16 between November 1980 and July 1981 at Grafton Close children's home in Hounslow, west London.

The home is at the centre of Operation Fernbridge, a Met probe launched last February looking into claims of a paedophile ring operating out of the Elm Guest House in Barnes, South West London.

As part of the probe investigators are looking into claims that children were taken from the home to the Elm Guest House to be sexually abused. 

Detectives are examining allegations that several high profile figures including the late MP Cyril Smith, abused children from Grafton Close at the guest house. 

McSweeney, from Pease Pottage, West Sussex, was a trainee priest at the time of the alleged attacks.

He was leading the congregation at St George's Church in north Norwich when the claims against him emerged. 

Stingemore, from St-Leonards-on-Sea, was in charge of the Richmond Council-run home between February 1980 and July 1981.

He is also charged with two further counts of the same offence, one count of taking indecent photos of the child, one count of conspiring to bugger and one count of buggery. 

Both men appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court today for a brief hearing.

Dressed in a black suit, red patterned tie and red pocket square, McSweeney spoke only to confirm his name, age and address.

Stingemore, wearing a blue anorak, sat hunched in his wheelchair throughout the hearing and only sat up when asked to confirm his identity.  

The two defendants appeared today at Westminster Magistrates Court. McSweeney pleaded not guilty to the charge, while Stingemore did not enter any pleas

McSweeney indicated a not guilty plea to the charge while no indication was made on behalf of Stingemore.

Both men are already due to stand trial at Southwark Crown Court in February  charged with a string of similar offences.

McSweeney is due to stand trial accused of taking an indecent photograph of a child and two counts of indecent assault on a male person in the 1980s.

He also faces three counts of making indecent photographs of a child and a further count of possessing indecent images.

He will stand trial alongside Stingemore, who denies five counts of indecent assault on a male person, indecency with a child and taking an indecent photograph of a child. 

The home was run as an adolescent unit where children were assessed before being placed into foster care or more permanent homes. 

Stingemore and McSweeney, who were released on unconditional bail, are due to next appear at Southwark Crown Court on September 9 when it is thought an application will be made for the two cases against them to be joined.
