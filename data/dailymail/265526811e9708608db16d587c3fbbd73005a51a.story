When it comes to designing handbags, Anya Hindmarch is constantly on a quest to find beauty in the banal.

Last season saw the British accessories designer transform her London Fashion Week catwalk-turned-conveyor-belt into supermarket sweep with dancing salesmen, glamorous lady shoppers pushing trollies and all the usual household essentials transformed into handbags.

Anya's AW14 totes, which came emblazoned with washing detergent and cereal packaging became the season's must-have arm candy. So what has she got lined up for SS15? 

Fashion goes fun! Anya Hindmarch, one of Britain's most esteemed accessory designers, unveiled her SS15 handbag collection at London Fashion Week today

Always one to put the fun into the last day of London fashion week, Anya's catwalk was modelled on a fairground, complete with skeletons, giant teacups and, of course, handbags.

Her totes were as bright as her catwalk and, perhaps in a nod to back to school season, came emblazoned with customisable stickers.

The perfect rave accessory? Lots of her handbags, which came in neon colours such as orange and yellow, which glowed the dark

The sticker bags for grown-ups were plastered with giant pencils, rainbows and slogans such as 'bags have feelings too'. It's these quirky details that really define Anya as a designer. 

Proving to be the perfect rave companion, most of her handbags are glow in the dark and come with huge chandelier tassels and paint splatters.

Discussing the inspiration behind her designs, Anya said: 'SS15 was inspired by the idea of taking stickers that were my schoolgirl version of "personalisation" but making them beautifully and handcrafted in leather. My idea was that you can "sticker up" your handbag or phone or notebook and make it into your own personal artwork or buy bags that already have sticker designs worked into the leather. 

'I love the combination of a grown up snakeskin handbag smothered in leather stickers.' 

Watched from the front row by super-fan Poppy Delevingne, as well as Richard E Grant and Caroline Sieber, Anya's colourful show had Twitter abuzz. 

A fun end to fashion week: As London Fashion Week draws to a close today, Anya was clearly keen to have some fun on the runway

Famous fans: Hindmarch's career began at the age of 18 when she was studying in Florence, Italy and her handbags are now loved by the likes of Poppy Delevingne and the Duchess of Cambridge

Artsy: The bags, which cost around £1,500, came in bright hues and splattered with tonal paints

Can't wait until next season to get your hands on one of her bags? Fear not.

The designer, whose thousand-pound totes are loved by everyone from Angelina Jolie to the Duchess of Cambridge, has created a cut-price offering for her thrifty fans.

She has exclusively designed special packs of Kellogg’s Frosties - renamed as Fashion Flakes - which will be sold next to her famous tote bags and clutches in flagship stores from Bond Street to Hong Kong.

There she is! Anya runs 60 shops in 17 countries and counts the likes of Keira Knightley, Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller, Madonna and the late Margaret Thatcher as fans

The move comes after the success of her AW14 cereal inspired handbags launched earlier this year featuring Kellogg’s famous mascots Tony the Tiger and Cornelius the Cockerel.

The cereal packs - made at Kellogg’s Manchester factory - will go on sale in Anya Hindmarch stores this week priced at £3 and are expected to sell out quickly following their launch at London Fashion Week.

Hindmarch's career began at the age of 18 when she was studying in Florence, Italy.

Noting that drawstring leather duffle bags were popular, she borrowed £600 to import some to England and quickly sold 500, with a little help from Harpers & Queen magazine.

A year later she had opened her first shop in Hackney. Fast forward 25 years and she now runs 60 shops in 17 countries and counts the likes of Keira Knightley, Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller, Madonna and the late Margaret Thatcher as fans.

Sorry, Cara. It looks like your new Mulberry totes have been knocked off the season's most coveted list. 

Can't afford the real deal? Anya unveiled Kellogg's inspired bags for AW14 and she has teamed up with the food giant to create £3 Fashion Flakes, right, which will go on sale in Anya Hindmarch stores this week
