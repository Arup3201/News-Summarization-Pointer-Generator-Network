Price battle: Dutch EU Commissioner Neelie Kroes (pictured) says that mobile networks are making profits of up to 400 per cent on calls abroad

The slow destruction of the great European mobile phone 'roaming rip-off' continues today with call charges set to be slashed again for consumers.

From today it will be 3p per minute cheaper to make a call while abroad, and it will cost no more than 10 per minute to receive a call.

The EU has said it would like to see differences in the cost of phone use at home and abroad to disappear altogether by 2015.

The changes bring the EU a step closer to making sure that within three years it will be the same price to use a mobile either at home or abroad.

Commissioners have taken action because network operators are making profits of an astonishing 200 per cent on calls made in Europe and a staggering 400 per cent on calls received.

From today the maximum permitted charge people will pay must be no more than 32p per minute, excluding VAT, for calls made while abroad - down from 35p.

The rules mean it will also be no more than 10p per minute for calls received while abroad in EU countries.

The cost of sending a text message remains at a maximum of 10p while it costs nothing to receive one.

But despite this, existing rules to prevent bill shocks for using the internet on a mobile while abroad remain weak. 

Operators must only apply an automatic 50 Euros or £45 cut-off limit on accounts unless the customer explicitly agrees otherwise, but need not do anything else. 

Operators must warn customers when they reach 80 per cent of their limit.

The EU's Digital Agenda Commissioner Neelie Kroes admitted today that despite the cuts, a lack of open competition means operators are still making massive profits on foreign calls and internet use.

Savings: The cost in euros of making and receiving calls while abroad has fallen slowly since 2009

Still expensive: Consumers arriving in Europe by air, sea or rail will have the cost of using their phone abroad cut but mobile internet prices are still very high

'These
latest price caps will temporarily reduce retail prices for making and 
receiving voice calls when in another EU country during the coming 
year,' he said.

'But we have to tackle roaming problems at the root with a long-lasting structural approach.

'The Commission will therefore be coming forward very shortly with comprehensive new proposals for long-term solutions to address the underlying problem of lack of competition in roaming markets.'

Making calls: 3p cheaper

Receiving calls: Capped at 10p per minute

Sending Texts: 10p max

Receiving texts: Free

Data roaming (internet): £45 limit*

* Unless requested.

Compulsory maximum roaming rates were first imposed on mobile network operators four years ago to tackle what the Commission called the 'roaming rip-off'.

A legal claim by the networks that the Commission was exceeding its powers failed last year, and rates fell further.

Action by Brussels against high roaming charges has been one of the most popular consumer-driven moves by the EU.

On average there has been a 60 per cent cut in the maximum charges operators could levy on mobile users making or receiving calls while in another EU country since 2007.

Tomorrow's additional price drop means mobile roaming charges are about 75 per cent cheaper on average than they were six years ago when the Commission first urged operators to cut their rates voluntarily.

The current roaming rules apply until June 2012 and the European Commission is due to present its plans for the following period next week.
