Families enjoying a day out on the water on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, Thursday had an unexpected close encounter with a Great White shark.

The usually elusive marine predator, estimated at 15 feet in length, was sighted off the coast of Chatham yesterday afternoon.

Experts believe the shark was hunting seals in the channel and was caught at low tide.

Close encounter: The Shakin family were boating off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, Thursday when they ran into this Great White shark in the water  

Predator: The male shark was estimated to be about 15 feet in length 

On the hunt: Researchers say the massive fish was likely out chasing seals when it got caught in low tide 

Thrilled: Catherine Shakin's sister, Kelsey, was able to capture a video showing the shark approach her family's boat 

A video recorded by 17-year-old Kelsey Shakin, who was out on a boat with her family Thursday, captured the moment the shark swam up to their vessel.

'My God, Shark'! the boaters could be heard screaming and gasping in shock as the fish approached the Shakins' vessel.

'I was like, "Oh, my God, there's a shark.” And it was really, really big,' Kelsey's 13-year-old sister, Catherine Shakin, later recalled to WCVB.

Jess Metzler, who also had a run-in with the sea monster, said the Great White came so close to her boat that she could reach out and touch it.

Thriving species: The population of Great Whites has been on the rise due to successful conservancy efforts  

The sightings prompted officials in Chatham to issue warnings to swimmers, but the local beaches remained open Friday.

The Atlantic White Shark Conservancy, a Cape Cod-based non-profit group committed to raising public awareness of sharks, shared another video on its Facebook page Thursday showing the male sea creature swimming off Chatham.

The GoPro footage depicting the predator silently traversing the turquoise waters was captured by John Chisholm, a researcher with the Massachusetts Shark Research program who is currently working on a shark population study.

On Wednesday, the Cape Cod conservancy group shared on Facebook a stunning still image captured a week earlier showing a male shark, possibly the same one that was sighted Thursday, swimming in the same area.

Experts say Great Whites are fairly common around Cape Cod; there have been more than a dozen sightings so far this year.

Earlier sighting: The Atlantic White Shark Conservancy shared this incredible still of a Great White spotted in the area of Cape Cod last week 

A study by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists, published in June in the journal PLOS ONE, said shark population has climbed since about 2000 in the western North Atlantic.

The scientists behind the study attributed the resurgence to conservation efforts, such as a federal 1997 act that prevented hunting of great whites, and greater availability of prey, esecpailly seals.

The species is listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

The research added recent unpublished data to previously published records to establish 649 confirmed white shark sightings from 1800 to 2010. The data showed that a period of decline in white shark abundance during the 1970s and 1980s has reversed, the authors said.
