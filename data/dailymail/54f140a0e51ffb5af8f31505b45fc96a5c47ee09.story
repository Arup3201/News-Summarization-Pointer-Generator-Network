Nigel Pearson knows how to pull off a great escape but the Leicester boss insists there are no quick fixes to save the Foxes.

They are bottom of the Barclays Premier League at Christmas ahead of the Boxing Day visit of Tottenham.

Only two sides have ever survived being bottom on December 25 - Sunderland last season and West Brom in 2005.

Nigel Pearson knows how to pull off a great escape but the Leicester boss insists there are no quick fixes 

And Pearson was Bryan Robson's assistant when the Baggies became the first team in Premier League history to survive the traditional relegation.

They stayed up on the final day of the 2004-05 season with the lowest ever points total to beat the drop, 34.

Now, Leicester are winless in 12 games and five points from safety and Pearson insisted they must match the Baggies' ethic and strength to survive.

He said: 'You're looking at strength of character and we made additions and key players came in then: Kieran Richardson and Kevin Campbell added to what was a really good group of people who had a common goal and worked exceptionally hard.

Pearson was Bobby Robson's assistant when the West Brom avoided relegation in 2005

'That's always going to be the base line.

'To win things you need those qualities, to avoid relegation you need those qualities. Ability gets you so far, strength of character too, but it's trying to get a balance of the two.

'There is a desire and a willingness to look for the answers. There are no quick fixes in life, well there might be but they don't have enough longevity. It's about winning the next game, as it always has been for us.'

West Brom beat Portsmouth 2-0 on the final day in 2005 to send Crystal Palace, Southampton and Norwich down.

Pearson insisted Leicester would need to keep a clear head to give themselves a chance of survival.

Pearson has highlighted the importance of his squad sticking together during the difficult months ahead

'I don't think there's any one recipe for dealing with these situations,' he said. 'My time at West Brom was the lowest points total ever to stay up.

'You can never be in control of the situation but there has to be a bit of clarity in your thinking. It's important there's a common goal and ultimately you need people to stay together.

'You will hear other people talking about siege mentalities and utilising some negative aspects to galvanise you but it depends on the chemistry within your own club.

'I don't think there's ever one absolute answer - it's not like the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.'
