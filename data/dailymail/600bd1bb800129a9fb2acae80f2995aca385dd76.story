Facebook is to roll out a new feature that can inform friends and loved ones of your well-being during and after a natural disaster.

Called Safety Check, the service lets you input whether you are safe or not in the affected area.

Users can then also see how other friends and family in an affected area are doing and can mark people as ‘safe’.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced 'Safety Check' while in Japan. If you are in a zone affected by a natural disaster it asks if you're okay. By tapping 'I'm safe' the app will send notifications that you are fine. Friends and family can see a list of friends in affected areas who are safe

If Facebook notices that you are using a device in an affected area during a natural disaster like an earthquake, it will ask: ‘Are you safe?’

Your location is determined by the city listed in your profile, you last location if you use the Nearby Friends product or the city where you are using the internet.

It can be used around the world on Android, iOS, feature phone and on computers.

· Let friends and family know you’re safe

· Check on others in the affected area

· Mark your friends as safe

If you’re not in the area, you can select ‘I’m not in the area.’

And if you’re in the area but are okay, you can select ‘I’m safe.’

This will send out a notification and News Feed story with your update.

Friends can then also mark you as 'safe', so they know they don’t have to worry.

The service is available now for iOS, Android, feature phones and desktops (shown). Your location is determined by the city listed in your profile, you last location if you use the Nearby Friends product or the city where you are using the internet

The tool can also be used to keep track of friends in an affected area. Once the tool has been activated, a notification will be received each time a friend checks in as being safe. 

The company says that this development came about from the comparable Disaster Message Board that was created by Facebook after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan.

‘Unfortunately, these kinds of disasters happen all too frequently. 

'Each time, we see people, relief organisations and first responders turn to Facebook in the aftermath of a major natural disaster,’ Naomi Gleit, vice president of product management at Facebook, said in a release.

‘If you’re ever in a situation that would require you to use Safety Check, we hope it’s a tool that helps you stay connected to those you care about, and gives you the comfort of knowing your loved ones are safe.'

If Facebook notices that you are using a device in an affected area during a natural disaster like an earthquake, it will ask: ‘Are you safe?’ If you’re not in the area, you can select ‘I’m not in the area.’ And if you’re in the area but are okay, you can select ‘I’m safe.’ This will send out a notification and News Feed story with your update
