Three bombs have exploded within an hour of each other outside a hotel in the Somali capital, killing at least 11 people, it has been reported.

It is believed at least 17 more people have been wounded after the triple blasts earlier today.

The three bombs exploded within an hour outside the front of the Jazira hotel, which is popular with government officials and tourists, and is in a heavily fortified district of the capital.

Reuters reports the first two bombs came in quick succession and were followed by heavy bursts of gunfire by Somali security forces.

The third blast took place about an hour later when a bomb went off inside a car that was being searched by the military.

'At least 11 people are dead and 17 
others are wounded. That is what we have carried,' Abdikadir Abdirahman,
 the director of a private ambulance service said.

A doctor at the Madina hospital said at least one body and 10 wounded people had been brought in.

'First we heard a big crash and the security forces immediately opened fire,' said Abdullahi Hussein who lives 300 metres behind the hotel.

'After a few minutes another explosion took place and there was more gunfire.'

There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the Islamist rebel group al Shabaab has carried out a campaign of attacks over the past two and a half years in Mogadishu, underscoring the huge security challenges the government faces

The Associated Press has put the death toll lower - with at least six dead and eight wounded.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the Islamist rebel group al Shabaab has carried out a campaign of attacks over the past two and a half years in Mogadishu, underscoring the huge security challenges the government faces.

Al Shabaab suicide bombers have targeted the Jazira hotel before, in an attack late last year.

The al-Qaida-linked Islamic rebels frequently stage lethal attacks in Somalia near the seat of government and at sites popular with foreigners.

In a radio message on Tuesday, a senior al-Shabab commander warned civilians to stay away from government buildings as well as sites controlled or owned by foreigners.

The commander, Ali Mohammed Hussein, said attacks were imminent in Mogadishu. 

Al-Shabab once controlled Mogadishu, but it was ousted from the capital in August 2011. 

In September, the militants claimed responsibility for an attack on the Westgate Mall in neighboring Kenya that killed 67 people.
