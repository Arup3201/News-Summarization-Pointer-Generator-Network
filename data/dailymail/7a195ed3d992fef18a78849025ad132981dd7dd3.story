An Indian woman's parents have strangled her to death after claiming she destroyed their family's 'prestige' by marrying a man from a different caste, police say.

The tragic death of Bhavna Yadav, a 21-year-old student from a leading New Dehli University, appears to be the latest of a series of cruel honour killings that have shocked India.

Police allege Bhavna was strangled by her parents and uncle because she had secretly married 24-year-old Abhishek Seth in a union that undermined their family's 'prestige'.

Abhishek is  Punjabi, while Bhavna was Yadav, from the Rajasthan region.

She told her parents day after the couple secretly married. Under the auspices of sorting out their differences, her parents Jagmohan and Savitri Yadav then invited her to come home.

It was during this stay she was beaten and strangled. After killing their daughter, the parents took her body to their village in Alwar, Rajasthan, where they set it on fire, police said.

Abhishek told NDTV: 'I never got any indication of course that her parents would do this. If I had any inkling, I would have never sent her back home.

'Six months ago, I called her parents and told them about us - they told me: "You are Punjabi, stay away. We are Yadavs. This won't work".'

Jagmohan and Savitri were arrested on Tuesday and sent to judicial custody by a Delhi court - although police are still hunting Bhavna's uncle, who is suspected of being complicit in the murder.

'The accused have been charged with murder, but we are investigating if it is a case of honour killing,' a senior police official said.

Police said they began investigating after Abhishek, an assistant programmer, made a written complaint on November 16.

Police contacted the victim's parents at their village in Alwar and took them into custody when they failed to give information about their daughter.

'While questioning they broke down and admitted that they had strangled their daughter at their Delhi home,' said the officer.

The parents told the police that they called her back to their home when she informed them about her marriage.

The victim was a Sanskrit honours student of Venkateswara College.
