A woman was restrained by a flight crew and forcefully taken off of a plane on Christmas eve after being refused one last drink.

Trish Sen, 39, was on her way from Los Anegles, California to Fort Lauderale, Florida when she exhibited aggressive behavior and was met by local law enforcement upon arrival at around 6:00 am.

She was then taken to Broward jail and released at $1,000 bail.

ABC news reports that there was a dispute over what had actually happened on the flight. Some reports say Trish became angry after being refused a drink. Other reports say that she literally scratched the pilot.

Sen says that she was merely trying to get back to her seat when the flight crew 'attacked her.'

'I was not drunk.' she told CBS.

The police report details Sen's interaction with the pilot of the aircraft.

'He was scratched on both arms while trying to restrain suspect Sen who was disruptive and failing to comply with the flight crew's instructions while in flight. I did observe numerous scratches on the victim's arms,' the police report said.

Jet Blue also released a statement, 'On December 23, a customer onboard Flt 100 LAX-FLL exhibited aggressive behavior and had to be restrained. Local law enforcement met the aircraft upon arrival. We are cooperating with law enforcement's investigation.'

Sen went to the Fort Lauderdale court on Christmas day where she showed the judge the bruises up and down her arms. The judge told Sen she needed to save that information for her upcoming trial in Ft.Lauderdale.

CBS Miami reports that the judge said, 'No, no, no. Don’t tell me about the facts of your case, okay, we’re going to save that for your trial judge.'

Sen told the judge that he had no prior charges. She will face a misdemeanor battery charge.

Sen was supposed to meet her family in Columbia for Christmas and told reporters who waited outside the airport for her on Thursday that she just wanted to go home.

'I would like to please get to the airport, so if you could please get out of my face,' she told the reporters waiting for her outside the jail.  'I think I’ve given you a statement, I would like to find a taxi.'

One customer on board tweeted, 'Strangest flight yet – red eye, lady goes nuts and starts yelling all over the place, she is cuffed and subdued in the back of the plane…'
