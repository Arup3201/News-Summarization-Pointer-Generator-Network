Two teenage brothers have died in a heartbreaking murder-suicide after one shot the other dead before killing himself during an argument.

Stephen Odeus, 14, and his brother Stanley Blanc, 16, were arguing about sharing clothes in their apartment in Little Haiti, Florida at 11pm on Sunday when the fight escalated.

Their brother, 18-year-old Mark Blanc, said he broke up the fight but it flared up again moments later.

He then 
watched in horror as Stephen pulled out a gun and shot his brother once 
as they stood in the hallway. He said the younger boy then walked around
 the corner and shot himself dead.

Distraught: Their older brother Mark witnessed the shooting and said he couldn't believe how it escalated

'Right before my eyes my brother just shot my other brother,' Mark told CBS4.

'You think it's just going to be a 
regular fight,' he added to WSVN. 'Just the usual fight, you know, it's about 
something small, and then it escalates into a death. It's the world we 
live in.'

Both of the boys were rushed to hospital but were pronounced dead.

'You never expect it to get to 
that point,' Mark said, adding that his mother has not stopped crying since the shootings.

Inseparable: The brothers had been planning to go out and were arguing about sharing clothes, relatives said

Loss of life: Stephen, pictured, is believed to have got the gun from a neighbor, his brother said

He said that he had never seen his brother with a gun before and thinks he got it from a neighbor.

The younger teen was scheduled to graduate from Horace Mann Middle School in El Portal on Tuesday, just two days after the tragedy.

On Monday, there were memorials outside the block, including handwritten messages saying that the boys would be missed, placed beneath stuffed animals.

Neighbors said they were shocked at the passing of the 'inseparable' boys, who had always been respectful.

'From what I could see from the outside, nothing seemed wrong,' Pamela Williams, a neighbor, said.

Miami police are still investigating exactly what happened.
