President Obama said Friday that if the top two leaders of the Senate can't agree on a budget deal to avert the fiscal cliff of higher taxes and severe spending cuts, then he will send his own proposal to Congress for an up-or-down vote.

'The hour for immediate action is here - it is now,' Obama said in remarks from the White House briefing room following a meeting with congressional leaders.

'We're now at the point where in just four days, every American's tax rates are scheduled to go up by law. Every American's paycheck will get considerably smaller.'

President Obama said that if the top two leaders of the Senate can't agree on a budget deal to avert the fiscal cliff of higher taxes and severe spending cuts, then he will send his own proposal to Congress for an up-or-down vote

Describing his hour-long meeting with 
congressional leaders as 'constructive,' Obama said he is 'modestly 
optimistic' that an agreement can be reached before the December 31 
deadline when the fiscal cliff is scheduled to take effect.

But he also cast doubt on Congress' 
ability to get anything done and scolded them for waiting this long to 
negotiate a compromise.

'Given how things have been working 
in this town, we always have to wait and see until it actually happens,'
he said, adding that Americans are fed up with Washington's lack of action on the fiscal cliff.

'Already you are starting to see 
businesses and consumers starting to hold back because of the 
dysfunction they are seeing in Washington.'

If the Senate does not come up with a compromise that it can approve and pass to the House for a vote before Sunday, Obama has ordered Sen. Harry Reid, the top Democrat in the Senate, to propose a vote on a basic package that would preserve tax cuts for middle-class Americans while extending unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless and working toward a foundation for a broader deal.

'I believe such a proposal could pass both houses,' Obama said. 'If members of the House or the Senate want to vote no, they can, but we should let everybody vote.'

Success is far from guaranteed in an
atmosphere of political mistrust, however â€” even on a slimmed-down deal that 
postponed hard decisions about spending cuts into 2013, and pessimism 
vied with optimism in a Capitol where lawmakers grumbled about the 
likelihood of spending the new year holiday in the Capitol.

'The clock is ticking,' Sen. Max 
Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said in remarks on the
Senate floor as Obama and congressional leaders were meeting several 
blocks away at the White House. 'My message to them is simple. We can do
this. We can get this done, and we must,' added the Montana Democrat.

High stakes: US Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell arrives. Lawmakers said privately that any agreement would likely include an extension of middle-class tax cuts with increased rates at upper incomes

The guest list at the White House Friday included two 
Republicans, House Speaker John Boehner, and Senate Republican leader 
Mitch McConnell; as well as Democrats Harry Reid and Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, her party's leader in the 
House.

The same group last met more than a 
month ago and emerged expressing optimism they could strike a deal that 
avoided the fiscal cliff. At that point, Boehner had already said he was
willing to let tax revenues rise as part of an agreement, and the 
president and his Democratic allies said they were ready to accept 
spending cuts.

Since then, though, talks between 
Obama and Boehner faltered, the speaker struggled to control his 
rebellious rank and file, and Reid and McConnell sparred almost daily in
speeches on the Senate floor. Through it all, Wall Street has paid 
close attention, and in the moments before the meeting, stocks were 
trading lower for the fifth day in a row.

The core issue is the same as it has 
been for more than a year, Obama's demand for tax rates to rise on upper
incomes while remaining at current levels for most Americans.

He made 
the proposal central to his successful campaign for re-election, when he
said incomes above $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for couples 
should rise to 39.6 percent from the current 35 percent.

Boehner refused for weeks to accept 
any rate increases, and simultaneously accused Obama of skimping on the 
spending cuts he would support as part of a balanced deal to reduce 
deficits, remove the threat of spending cuts and prevent the 
across-the-board tax cuts.

Last week, the Ohio Republican 
pivoted and presented a Plan B measure that would have let rates rise on
million-dollar earners. That was well above Obama's latest offer, which
called for a $400,000 threshold, but more than the speaker's rank and 
file were willing to accept.

Facing defeat, Boehner scrapped plans
for a vote, leaving the economy on track for the cliff that political 
leaders in both parties had said they could avoid. In the aftermath, 
Democrats said they doubted any compromise was possible until Boehner 
has been elected to a second term as speaker when the new Congress 
convenes on Jan. 3.

Apart from income tax rates, 
congressional officials in both parties said a handful of other issues 
were the subject of private talks in the Capitol. These included the 
Alternative Minimum Tax, which would effectively raise taxes on millions
of upper-middle-class families unless Congress acts; as well as taxes 
on capital gains, dividends and estates.

In addition, benefits for the 
long-term unemployed are due to expire in the next few days, and doctors
face the prospect of a deep cut in the fees they receive for treating 
Medicare patients unless legislation is passed to prevent it.

Further compounding the year-end 
maneuvering, there are warnings that the price of milk could virtually 
double beginning next year.

Congressional officials said that 
under current law, the federal government is obligated to maintain 
prices so that fluid milk sells for about $20 per hundredweight. If the 
law lapses, the Department of Agriculture would be required to maintain a
price closer to $36 of $38 per hundredweight, they said. It is unclear 
when price increases might be felt by consumers.

On January 1st the tax cuts instituted by George W. Bush expire and huge spending cuts will have to occur.

In total $607 billion of cuts and tax rises are planned, these include:

If this happens most observers say that a five percent cut in the country's output will happen in one swoop.

Unemployment, which has been falling could rise as businessess have to cut back in hiring because of the new costs.

The
head of The Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke has said that falling off the
fiscal cliff could send the economy 'toppling back into recession'.

The
Congressional Budget Office has said that U.S. unemployment could rise 
above nine percent in a year if the impasse is not resolved.

And
as is often the case, any difficulties experienced in the world's 
largest economy will affect the health of the global financial 
situation.
