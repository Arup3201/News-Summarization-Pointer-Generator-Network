The 298 passengers and crew aboard MH17 will have been oblivious to the horror as a shrapnel-based missile instantly shredded the plane, experts claim.

The SA-11 missile - known as a Grizzly - that hit the doomed Malaysian Airlines flight is designed to pulverise aircraft on impact.

It will have perforated the plane at various points, ignited the fuel, and taken out the engines and the wings within a split second - meaning the people aboard will have been unconscious almost instantly.

'Oblivious': Experts assure that nobody on board the doomed Malaysian Airlines flight will have been aware of the horror as the cabin will have exploded instantly

What happened: The SA-11 missile which hit the MH17 flight is designed to shred aircraft on impact by letting off a ring of shrapnel that hits various points

A BUK missile system in the firing position, during an international arms fair held last year. The launcher, an armoured truck, takes up position and once its crew have acquired the target, it takes five minutes for the first missle to be launched.

The surface-to-air missile hit the Boeing 777 with such force that residents in the area claim to have seen bodies falling from the sky ‘like rags’.

Justin Bronk, researcher analyst at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told MailOnline: 'An SA-11 missile is designed to shred aircraft.

'The extent at which the remains of the aircraft are spread across a large area seems to confirm that.

'The missile is programmed using a tracker to get within a metre of the target then let off a ring of shrapnel, which will enter the aircraft at various points.

'The shrapnel will have hit the wings, the engines and the fuel tanks, igniting the fuel.

'A large aircraft like that is highly pressurised to allow humans to breathe at that altitude so it will have exploded instantly.

MH17 was believed to have been taken down by an SA-11 missile, known as a Grizzly or Gadfly in the US, or a Buk in Russia.

The surface-to-air missile has a range of 1.8 to 12.4 miles and can hit targets up to an altitude of 75,000ft.

It is launched from a command vehicle using a target-acquisition radar.

Once a target has been selected it takes five minutes to warm up.

Depending on the model, the missile would then accelerate to at least 2,790ft per second to up to 4,035ft per second.

This means it would have reached MH17 at 33,000ft high just eight  seconds after being fired.

'Almost nobody on board would have 
known what was happening. If not instantly, they will have been 
unconscious within split seconds.'

Speculation over the source of the 
missile, which remains unconfirmed, has sparked a propaganda battle 
between both sides of the Ukraine-Russia crisis.

Officials in Kiev have made repeated statements linking the attack to pro-Russian separatists.

Tonight, Downing Street supported the 
claims with a statement to say it appears 'increasingly likely that 
MH-17 was shot down by a separatist missile' fired from near Torez, an 
area controlled by pro-Russian rebels.

Naked bodies were strewn across fields in eastern Ukraine surrounded by 
hundreds of possessions - including children's books, playing cards, 
slippers, letters and old vinyl records - after the missile strike shortly after 1pm on Thursday.

Makeshift white flags marked where bodies lay in corn fields and among the debris.

Others,
 stripped bare by the force of the crash, had been covered by polythene 
sheeting weighed down by stones, one marked with a flower in 
remembrance.

One 
pensioner told how a corpse smashed though the roof of her house. 'There
 was a howling noise and everything started to rattle. Then objects 
started falling out of the sky,' said Irina Tipunova, 65.

'And then I 
heard a roar and she landed in the kitchen.'

The BUK missile system, also known as the SA-11 Gadfly, was created by the Soviet Union in 1979 to engage aircraft, cruise missiles and drones.

BUK - which means 'beech tree' in Russian - includes four missiles on a turntable mounted on a tracked vehicle. A separate tracked vehicle carries radars to guide the missiles.

Capable of carrying 154lbs (70kg) of 
highly-explosive warheads, BUK can send missiles up to an altitude of 
75,000ft (23,000 metres).

It
 takes just five minutes to warm up, 12 minutes to reload and 8-12 
seconds to reach its target. Once there, it has a kill probability of 90
 to 95 per cent.

Yesterday's
 missile is likely to have detonated within 65 feet (20 metres) of MH17,
 causing critical damage to the engines and control system of the 
aircraft.

The explosion would have ignited the fuel onboard the aircraft, causing destruction of the wing and fuselage.

‘Inside the missile is a variety of different warheads,’ a senior defence source told MailOnline.

‘These can be fragmentation or incendiary, depending on the target you are flying at. They can cut an aircraft in half, set it on fire or provide large pieces of shrapnel that shred it apart.’

The missile - thought to be the Mach 3 
semi-active homing 9M28M - was launched from the back of what is 
essentially a truck and has a range of 1.8 to 12.4 miles (3 to 20km).

A 13.8-inch (35cm) ‘seeker’ on the missile would have received information on the trajectory of the passenger aircraft from a radar station on a separate vehicle.

A typical battery to launch the missile is made up of command vehicle housing computers and displays.

The system used to determine whether a target is a friend or foe would not warn an operator that the target was an airliner - only that it was not a friend.  

A tracked variant of the BUK missile launching system on display last year at celebrations in Red Square for the anniversary of the end of World War II. Both tracked and wheeled versions of the launcher can fire a volley of four missiles in quick succession, each targeting a different aircraft.

A video released today by the Ukrainian Interior Ministry shows a tracked BUK missile launcher which the Kiev government claims was used to bring down Flight MH17. One of the missiles on the launcher appears to be missing as it was driven through the town of Krasnodon, towards the Russian border.
