Liam Neeson trotted around the Central Park horses’ stables on Sunday in support of New York’s horse-drawn carriage industry, which Mayor Bill de Blasio wants to shut down.

De Blasio has declared that it’s inhumane to keep horses in modern-day Manhattan and wants to replace them with electric cars.

But Mr Neeson said during his tour that the horses are ‘well cared for’.

The Non-Stop actor had invited all 51 council members to the stables, including the mayor, in a bid to show them the comfortable conditions they live in.

In the event, around 12 council members and 100 carriage drivers attended, with the mayor notably absent.

Mr Neeson said ‘he should have manned up and come, I'm disappointed he's not here’, according to the New York Daily News.

He continued: ‘It's a connection with our past, it's a connection with our history. And it has to be said - the great white elephant in the room, four prime locations on the West Side of New York that realtors must be salivating to get their hands on.’

The 61-year-old added: ‘The mayor wants to replace them with electric cars. That's exactly what New York needs, more cars. This experiment has been tried with electric cars in San Francisco -failed abysmally.’

Mr Neeson had said at the end of February that he's "a little bit p***** off" at Mayor Bill de Blasio for wanting to shut down the horse-drawn carriages.

Determined: On the horse-drawn carriage industry issue, Mayor Bill de Blasio has said 'we know where we¿re going on this'

The actor made the comment during an appearance on The Daily Show. The actor complained to host Jon Stewart that critics have put out false information about how the horses are treated. He says the carriage drivers treat the horses like their own children.

The mayor has faced fierce criticism that he has advocated the ban without having seen the horses’ stables for himself.

He said in a recent press conference: ‘“I’ll look at the stables. But the bottom line is, we know where we’re going on this.’

Campaign group NYCLASS has launched a petition for the horse-drawn tradition to be made illegal.

It said: ‘Horses do not belong in a congested, urban setting where they constantly breathe exhaust while dodging dangerous traffic. The horses live their lives confined to the shafts of their carriage and the shafts of their tiny stable stalls, with no access to green pastures.’
