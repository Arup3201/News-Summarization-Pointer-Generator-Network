Two earthquakes have struck north of Los Angeles, shaking parts of Ventura and Los Angeles counties, but fire officials say no significant damage took place.

The U.S. Geological Survey says a magnitude-4.5 quake hit at about 7:18 PST on Saturday and was centered close to 50 miles north of Los Angeles near the town of Castaic.

The Los Angeles Times reports that a magnitude-3.0 quake occurred near the same place about 20 minutes earlier.

The Times says there have been three earthquakes of magnitude-3.0 or greater centered in the area over the last 10 days.

Victoria Contreras, 49, a clerk at Gallion's Market in Castaic, told The L.A. Times that a second earthquake shook the shelves stocked with liquor and soda.

'All my bottles started rattling, then one great big boom,' said Contreras.

'I almost fell off the stool.'

Contreras told reporters that the shocks continued for 45 seconds but that the store didn't lose any other their stock.

No injuries or damages were reported to Los Angeles Fire Department as of yet.

Magnitude 3 or lower earthquakes are mostly almost imperceptible or weak and magnitude 7 and over can cause serious damage.

 The Los Angeles Fire Department noted that they are not in 'earthquake mode.'
