Alan Pardew believes new loan striker Yaya Sanogo will bring the 'chaos factor' to his relegation-threatened Crystal Palace side.

Pardew has got off to a flyer as Palace manager winning his first two games in charge against non-League Dover in the FA Cup and a shock victory versus Tottenham.

He is desperate to find fire power to keep his new side up this season and has turned to Arsenal for Sanogo.

'Strikers in the Premier League don't always have to score goals,' Pardew said, whose side face a relegation crunch match against Burnley on Saturday.

'I think Sanogo offers the chaos factor. He has technical ability and defenders don't always know what he's going to do.

'His main job here is to grow as a player and goals will make him grow quicker.'

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is adamant that Sanogo, 21, will turn into a top forward, but he has struggled since being given the chance in the north London club's first team.

Pardew sees all the attributes in the player to agree with Wenger.

'I spoke to Wenger about Sanogo and he has high regard for him,' Pardew added. 'He's got all the ingredients you need to have to be a Premier League player. Now he needs to grow in stature and confidence.'
