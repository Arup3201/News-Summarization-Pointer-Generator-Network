The images from San Diego angered and shocked millions - a heavily pregnant woman begging with a young boy at her feet who then laughed as she was driven away in a Mercedes Benz.

And now that woman has been found at it again a few days later. Only this time, she appears to have given birth and the man who drove her away is denying he owns a luxury car.

A member of the public who had seen the original story of the woman caught begging last week outside Eastlake Village Center recognized the gang on Tuesday and called up her local news station.

Busted: The woman - was found in University City and was confronted by a reporter who asked if she was the same woman panhandling across San Diego 

Friends: Accompanying her was a man - who is believed to be the driver of the Mercedes and the young boy - who is believed to be the same boy begging with her last week

Once there, a reporter for 10News in San Diego confronted the woman, who was holding a newborn baby, while the boy and the man were accompanying her.

The reporter, Emily Valdez, was told by the viewer that she had seen the man and woman holding a sign asking for money in the University City mall.

Presenting the picture that went viral this week to the woman, the reporter asked if that was her. 

She said she couldn't speak English and then failed to respond yes or no.

Infamous viral image: Shopper Melissa Smith, from San Diego, California, photographed the expectant mother and her child begging for money outside the city's Eastlake Village Center every weekend for the past two weeks

The same: A facial recognition expert said he is 80 percent sure these two women are the same - although in the days since the picture on the left, the woman appears to have given birth

The reporter then asked the man where his Mercedes was, to which he replied in Spanish, 'What Mercedes?'

The group then made a speedy exit and this time, instead of getting into the German made car, entered a black minivan and sped off.

Already convinced  this was the same woman and same group, 10News took their pictures to a face comparison expert.

He said that despite the darkness, he was 80 percent sure the images showed the same woman.

Last week, Melissa Smith, witnessed the-then expectant mother and her child panhandling - something she said they had been doing every weekend for the past two weeks.

Matching: The woman (left) seems to be wearing very similar leggings to the woman who the reporter caught up with on Tuesday (right)

Identical? The shoes that the woman on the left is wearing appear to be exactly the same as those on the right

It appears to also be the same boy pictured in both these images - an opinion shared by the facial recognition expert

Each time, they would hold a sign reading, 'Please help', and would receive money from dozens of shoppers. 'Lots of people gave them money,' Ms Smith said. 'Probably five people in five minutes.'

But last week, Ms Smith was putting gas into her car when she saw the pair leave their panhandling spot and meet up with the woman's boyfriend - before driving away in a dark-colored Mercedes.

'I noticed they grabbed their little boy and they got into a Mercedes-Benz,' she told KGTV . 'I thought, "Wow, a Mercedes-Benz. It's not even used - it's not old. It's a new Benz."'

The car appears to be an older Mercedes C320, which sold for $30,000 to $35,000 new.

In outrage, Ms Smith immediately stopped pumping gas, climbed into her own car and followed the Mercedes down the road, while snapping photos of the luxury vehicle and its license plate.

Caught on camera: Ms Smith took this photo of the car as it drove toward a shopping plaza on Bonita Road

'Lo and beyond they were in front of us,' she said. 'Here they are counting money, laughing and their little boy is not in a car seat or seat belt. He's all the way in the front seat with them.'

Astonishingly, Ms Smith watched the car turn into a nearby shopping plaza on Bonita Road, before the pregnant woman got out, grabbed the sign and started begging again.

As shoppers reached into their pockets to help her, Ms Smith started taking more photos of the woman, prompting the beggar to start shouting at her. She later sent the photos to KGTV.

According to the news station, the Mercedes's license plate number is registered to a woman with an Escondidio apartment complex address, where rent costs around $2,500 a month.

Residents at the complex said the people the station was looking for had recently moved and a forwarding address could not be obtained.

Police said the trio have not been reported by anyone else since Ms Smith's encounter. It is believed that they have not been detained nor questioned by officers.

The woman, her partner and the boy thought to be her son have not been identified.
