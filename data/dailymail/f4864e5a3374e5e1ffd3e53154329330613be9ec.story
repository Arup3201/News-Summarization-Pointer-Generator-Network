As many as 200,000 boys and girls are kidnapped in China every year and sold openly online, it’s been reported.

Child trafficking has been a long-standing problem in China, but despite the efforts of the authorities, the sinister practice is thriving, leading to thousands of families being torn apart.

The US State Department believes that 20,000 children are snatched every year – that’s 400 a week.

However, Chinese state media says the figure could be as high as 200,000, according to the BBC.

Baby boys, who are preferred in China because they’ll ensure the family name remains intact, can sell for as much as £10,500.

In a bid to evade the spotlight of the police, child traffickers in recent years have turned to the internet to do their selling.

Last year hundreds of babies were rescued by police in China after a crackdown was launched on trafficking infants.

The nationwide bust saw 1,094 people arrested as officers acted on information relating to four major internet-based baby trafficking rings.

China's Public Security Ministry said 382 babies were rescued after four websites were found to be selling children under the guise of adoption.

Some critics say the trade is fuelled by the country’s one-child policy.

The strict laws limit many families to one child, and with boys being favoured as heirs to the family name, many female babies are sold - typically fetching half the amount boys do - aborted or abandoned.

Poverty fuels the trade, while illicit profits tempts traffickers, resulting in a thriving market for babies and toddlers.

An investigation by the BBC revealed the plight of one father, Xiao Chaohua, who has not seen his son since February 2007 after he disappeared from their home in Huizhou, aged five.

Since then Mr Chaohua has scoured the nation and even taken out TV adverts in an effort to find him, but to no avail.

He claims that the problem of trafficking can only be eradicated if tougher laws are brought in to punish those to buy kidnapped children.

Presently, they face a three-year jail term if caught, but it’s claimed that many never find themselves in trouble over their actions.
