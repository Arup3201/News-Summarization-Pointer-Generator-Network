Anger: Ridley Scott is under fire in Spain for ruining a traditional Christmas procession

Ridley Scott is under fire in Spain for ruining a traditional Christmas procession.

The British director has left locals in Telde, Gran Canaria, fuming after he rented all the camels from a zoo for his latest film.

It means there's none left for the city's annual Three Kings Parade.

Organisers are now being forced to look at alternative transportation for the gift-giving trio.

'The
 venue that always rents them to us (Fuerteventura Oasis Park) has told 
us that Ridley Scott has hired out all the animals so they haven't got 
any for us,' moaned culture minister Daniel Martin.

'It's impossible, because there is not a free camel anywhere for us now,' he added.

The popular parade winds its way through the city's streets ever year on Jan. 5.

Marking the night when the Three 
Kings arrived to see the baby Jesus, hundreds of children line the roads
 to catch sweets thrown from the trio.

But
 this year the filming of Scott's biblical blockbuster 'Exodus' on the 
nearby island of Fuerteventura has scuppered the traditional plans.

Martin told El Mundo that all other camels on the islands had already been booked up for other parades.

But he dismissed claims the procession would be stopped completely.

'It will be a surprise now,' he said, urging youngsters 'not to worry, because the Kings will still arrive in Telde.'

In the story of Exodus, Ramses, ruler of the Egyptian empire, battles his adopted brother Moses, who seeks to free the Hebrews from their enslavement to the king.

Transformation: An incredible set has been built in Almeria, Spain to depict ancient Egypt for the film

Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton joined the cast to play Moses and Ramses, respectively.

The
 script is by acclaimed writer Steve Zaillian, who has penned 
Schindler's List, Moneyball and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.

Exodus is slated for release on December 12, 2014, though that could change as the film enters production.

There's no word from Scott on the claims.

Competition:
 Exodus is one of two Moses films in development, alongside Gods and 
Kings, which Steven Spielberg previously dropped out of directing
