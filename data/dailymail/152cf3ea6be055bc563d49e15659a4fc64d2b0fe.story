A serial child rapist wrote to one of his traumatised victims from prison, telling her he missed her and begging her not to hate him.

Darren Myhill, 45, wrote to the teenage girl from the jail in Stockton-on-Tees where he is serving an indefinite sentence after admitting a catalogue of rape and sexual assault charges against five youngsters.

The Prison Service has launched an investigation after the victim received a letter from her attacker, scrawled on a piece of lined paper, saying: 'I miss u...Please try not to hate me too much.  Hatred will not take the pain away.'

'Hatred will not take the pain away': Serial paedophile Darren Myhill, 45, wrote to one of his victims from jail

The paedophile, from Throckley, near Newcastle, went on to complain that he felt bad, saying: 'The pain I feel plus sick to my stomach.'

He added: 'Please live your life', tried to exonerate himself by saying 'there were lies', and told his victim he loved her.

Frighteningly for his victim, the letter makes references to places the girl had visited in recent weeks, and also accuses her of lying.

Myhill, who is in HMP Holme House in Stocton-on-Tees, added: 'I could have killed myself, but that would have been the coward’s way out.'

He was jailed in April at Newcastle Crown Court after admitting 22 charges of rape, indecency with a child, indecent assault and incitement against victims aged between nine and 16.

The abuse stretched over more than 20 years, during which Myhill kept a scrapbook containing photographs of his victims and a checklist of the illegal sex acts he carried out on them.

He was initially jailed for 13-and-a-half years, of which just six would be served with the rest on licence.

But the Court of Appeal found his punishment to be 'unduly lenient' and quashed the original sentence, handing him instead an indefinite sentence which means he cannot be considered for release for 10 years.

The mother of the victim who received Myhill's letter said it left her daughter in floods of tears and too frightened to leave the house.

She said the letter to her daughter, who said after her attacker was jailed that she hoped she could get on with her life, came 'totally out of the blue.'

The mother said: 'She rang me screaming and crying her eyes out.

'I was away at the time and so had to come back as fast as I could to be with her.

'How can this be allowed to happen?  She is trying to get on with her life but now my girl is back to square one again.

'She still can't escape him if he is allowed to write to her like this.'

Today the Ministry of Justice promised to investigate how the letter managed to reach Myhill's victim.

A MoJ spokesman said prisoners' phonecalls and letters from jail were subject to 'robust' monitoring and said communications with victims should be restricted.

But they said prisoners occasionally managed to smuggle letters out of jail.

A Prison Service spokesman said there would be a full investigation and added: 'Our priority is protecting the public.

'There are very strict rules governing correspondence between offenders and their victim.'
