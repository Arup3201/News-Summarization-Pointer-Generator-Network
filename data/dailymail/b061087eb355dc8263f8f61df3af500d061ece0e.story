David Moyes, Phil Neville and David Gill were getting into the derby spirit as they watched Manchester United Under 21s lose in a close encounter with cross-town rivals City.

The United manager was joined by first team coach Neville and former chief executive Gill as the action unfolded at the AJ Bell Stadium.

In one picture from the game, Neville can be seen on his feet, lamenting a missed United chance during the first half in the Under 21 Premier League match.

City took the lead early in the game through a Greg Leigh header before hot prospect Jesse Lingard levelled the match.

But Patrick Vieira's talented youth side regained the lead shortly afterward through George Glendon, whose father Kevin had a brief spell at the club between 1979 and 1980.

City were without their exciting young winger Marcos Lopes, who is likely to be included in the squad to take on Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Wednesday evening.

Vieira's men managed to hold on for their eighth win in a row - not to mention the local bragging rights.
