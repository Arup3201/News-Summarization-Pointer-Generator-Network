A food-fanatic turned artist is gaining Instagram fame for her pop culture inspired - and edible - works of art.

Tisha Cherry, a New Jersey-born registered nurse, takes inspiration from films, music, and celebrities, and recreates iconic images using everyday food.

'Pop culture is essentially my muse and the food on my plate is my medium,' Ms Cherry tells Frank151.com of her unusual hobby.

Crumbs! Ms Cherry has replaced the bouquet of flowers from Banksy's original Flower Thrower work, with a bunch of her own namesake candy fruit, crafted using only the remnants of an Oreo

From Oreo cookies and ketchup, to 
watermelons and Caviar, any food can make for a good art medium, 
according to the resourceful Ms Cherry.

'It’s about finding the right ingredient to mimic color and the right utensil to manipulate that ingredient,' she explains.

'I use whatever I have in the kitchen: chopsticks, toothpicks, kitchen shears, fruit carving knife, etc. And if I make a mistake, I just eat it!'

Ms Cherry has over 7,000 followers on 
Instagram, and counting. She says her hobby was born out of her 
enthusiastic 'affinity' for food, and her 'boredom' of the ordinary.

'About two years ago, I first saw Bart Simpson’s silhouette in a pile of crumbled Butterfingers while prepping for brownies,' Ms Cherry says.

'Pop culture is essentially my muse and the food on my plate is my medium'

'Since then, every time I look at food I’ve been looking for a resemblance of some sort.'

Amusingly, she admits she often finds herself in chow-down situations where she is struck with a good idea, but fails on some occasions to turn her food into mini masterpieces because she is 'really hungry', or doesn't want to be 'rude' in restaurants.

I believe I can fry: Food junkie Tisha Cherry has claimed the unusual hobby of turning mealtimes into art, to create quippy snaps like this one (pictured) - an ode to R Kelly's best known song, replacing 'fly' with 'fry'

2 Pac-o: This is a portrait of the late rapper Tupac Shakur, surrounded with nibbles commonly found in tacos

 Ms Cherry's fry and ketchup creation, and Tupac's portrait (right) was 
fashioned from taco ingredients

When faced with her future as a more varied artist, Ms Cherry appears reluctant to move away from her lunch plate, at least for the time being.

'I find cooking and baking a form of art and very therapeutic in itself,' she remarks.

'I hope to develop my skills and take a more artistic approach, but for now I’m satisfied with my plate being my canvas and my chopsticks my paintbrush.'

Romance: The love between Beyonce and her Hip Hop mogul boyfriend Jay Z, immortalized (until mealtime's over) as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich

What a rice bird: This pigeon was created using caviar and rice, the former being a very expensive luxury food item, and the latter a cheap, 'staple' food in many parts of the world

Sandwich-worthy: The reigning king and queen of R&B, Jay Z (left) and his wife Beyonce (right), who were created by Ms Cherry out of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich

Tasty: The artist (pictured) enjoys a watermelon, but can't resist first carving the iconic Rolling Stones logo into its juicy flesh

Star War-termelon: Ms Cherry used this fruit to create an edible Death Star from George Lucas' Star Wars franchise

Groovy: Ms Cherry clearly has something of a fascination with watermelons, choosing the fruit as her canvas for a number of artworks, including a portrait of Questlove (left) and the Star Wars Death Star (right)

Tricky: A soup dumpling perched atop the faint outline of rapper Snoop Dogg, rendered using only a set of masterfully applied chopsticks

Sweet: This is a re-creation - using candy - of Andy Warhol's bright yellow banana artwork, which he created for the cover of a Velvet Underground album in 1967

Messy: This is a portrait of the American rapper French Montana - thus the French fries -  who has a record label called Coke Boys, created using careful smears of Jufran Banana Sauce

Food for thought: Andy Warhol's album cover (left) was not fashioned, as you might expect, from a banana, but from multicolored candy, while French Montana (right) is contrived from ketchup
