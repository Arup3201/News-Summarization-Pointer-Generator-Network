Brittany Maynard says in a video recorded 19 days before her assisted suicide death that no one should have to leave their home to legally end their life under doctor's care.

The 29-year-old California woman had terminal brain cancer and moved with her family to Oregon before killing herself last November. 

'Unfortunately, California law prevented me from getting the end-of-life option I deserved,' she said in the recording released Wednesday, hours ahead of a Senate health committee hearing on the issue. 

'No one should have to leave their home and community for peace of mind, to escape suffering, and to plan for a gentle death.'

Speaking from beyond the grave: Brittany Maynard, the terminally-ill woman who became the face of the right-to-die movement, appeared in a new video released by her family on Wednesday in support of a California bill legalizing assisted suicide. The 29-year-old moved to Oregon last year to apply for fatal drugs and died in November

While Maynard appeared calm and collected through most of the video, she did turn passionate when she spoke about her state government forced her move to states in order to get the drugs she needed to end her life. 

'How dare the government make decisions or limit options for terminally ill people like me,' Maynard said. 

'Making aid in dying a crime creates undue hardships and suffering for many people who are terminally ill and suffering tremendously. 

'The laws in California and 45 other states must change to prevent prolonged, involuntary suffering for all terminally ill Americans.

'Freedom from prolonged pain and suffering is a most basic human right,' Maynard says. 

While the video played, Maynard's husband Dan Diaz stood to the side and fought back tears. 

Tragedy: Maynard found out that she had terminal brain cancer a little more than a year after she married Diaz

When she spoke to reporters afterwards, he said that assisted suicide isn't for everyone, but that every American should have the option of dying the way they want. 

'What my wife did on Nov. 1 was by her design,' Diaz said. 'She avoided a painful, drawn out process and harmed no one else.'

Maynard's mother,  Deborah Zieglar, also spoke, saying: 'Life is more than breathing air in and out of your body. The definition of a good life and a good death varies person to person. Californians need the freedom to deal with terminal illness as they determine.'

The bill is expected to face a strong challenge, led by medical and religious groups. Opponents see huge consequences for allowing doctors to prescribe fatal drugs.

Among the opponents are other terminally ill patients such as Kara Tippetts, a 38-year-old Colorado mother of four, who wrote an open letter to Maynard in October urging her not to end her life.

Tippetts wrote that suffering can be 'the place where true beauty can be known.' She died this month of breast cancer.

Advocates for aid-in-dying laws say legislators in at least 17 states have introduced similar measures this year.

But past proposals have foundered in statehouses amid emotionally charged debates and strong opposition.

Some medical groups say prescribing life-ending medication violates a doctor's oath to do no harm, while some advocates for people with disabilities fear some sick patients would feel pressured to end their lives to avoid being a financial burden.

Advocates have said they would consider taking the issue to voters if it fails in the Legislature.

The practice is legal in five states, including Oregon. The other states are Montana, New Mexico, Vermont and Washington. 

Before her death, Maynard had made her case public with online videos, which were viewed tens of millions of times.

Maynard's husband, Dan Diaz, and her mother, Deborah Ziegler, joined state lawmakers in Sacramento on Wednesday to release her taped testimony in support of Senate Bill 128.

The proposal by Sens. Bill Monning, D-Carmel, and Lois Wolk, D-Davis, would allow terminally ill patients to kill themselves in California with drugs and dosages recommended by a doctor.
