Light entertainment had Morecambe and Wise. Nineteenth century homicide had Burke and Hare. Twenty-first century Whitehall has Letwin and Heywood. There they sat at a select committee, these two pillars of political consensus, these two gummer-uppers of the works.

Oliver Letwin is a Cabinet Office Minister. Sir Jeremy Heywood is the Cabinet Secretary. They were talking to the Political and Constitutional Reform Select Committee about fixed-term parliaments.

This committee is a stodgy pudding. Its chairman, mono-drone Graham Allen (Lab, Nottingham N), is devoted to the notion of responsible – not the same as responsive – government.

Notices announced that the committee is ‘piloting paperless working’; yet documents were strewn here and there. As with much in Whitehall, paperless working is a work in progress.

Chris Ruane (Lab, Vale of Clwyd) let slip that his Newport colleague Paul Flynn had described Messrs Letwin and Heywood as ‘a politician who wants to be a civil servant and a civil servant who wants to be a politician’. Ha! Mr Letwin, who may have stepped straight from Restoration comedy, responded with an ‘egad, how droll, sir’ face.

Sir Jeremy’s delight was less evident. Close-mown hairdo, rimless Herr Flick spectacles, pale, petite hands: it is a look that manages to be both antiseptic and diseased. You might not want Sir Jeremy to be your anaesthetist.

Fixed-term parliaments, they thought, were marvellous. We heard much of ‘stability’ and ‘good order’.

Fixed terms allowed for ‘planning’. The machine of government loves fixed terms. Mr Letwin is now so intellectual that he may not even carry his own A4 folder. He was accompanied by a flunkey who ferried it for him. The fellow wore a tie with a motif of white elephants.

No one on the committee bridled at fixed-term parliaments. No one made the point, ‘hang on, fixed terms are profoundly unparliamentary for they prevent MPs voting a Government out of office’. 

Paul Flynn (pictured) had described Messrs Letwin and Heywood as 'a politician who wants to be a civil servant and a civil servant who wants to be a politician'

Mr Letwin (whose voice is now indistinguishable from that of the late Nigel Hawthorne, who played Sir Humphry in ‘Yes Minister’) was able to get away with the blithe insistence ‘I’m a real believer in democracy’ quite unmocked.

A vote of no confidence in the House was once enough to topple a prime minister. How fares that principle in fixed-term parliaments?

Christopher Chope (Christchurch) wondered if Ukip should be admitted to the arrangement whereby Opposition parties have access to civil servants just before a general election. Quite why Mr Chope, a Tory, was pressing this argument, is not clear. Is he about to defect? After Nigel Farage’s peculiar, sub-National Front remarks about feeling like a foreigner on English trains, one hopes the decent Mr Chope might be better than that.

At mention of Ukip and its baleful Vikings, Mr Letwin whinneyed. Sir Jeremy, the cold-blooded goldfish, just blanked the suggestion,  saying he was ‘doubtful but no decision has been taken’.

From  Sir Jeremy’s lean lips, the word ‘doubtful’ sounds as chill as Capt Birdseye’s codpiece.

The prospect of mixing with the Official Opposition immediately before an election was more to Sir Jeremy’s liking.

A ghostly enthusiasm almost broke through the wintry mask. The process, he explained, ‘allows the politicians to inform the civil service of issues they may not want to make public’. Ye blasted gods, was there ever a more succinct expression of the anti-democratic nature of this sinister, sovereignty-fleecing flesh-pimpler Heywood? What is the point of a general election campaign if politicians do not tell voters their intentions?

Yet here was Sir Jeremy, oozing satisfaction that his Whitehall lever pullers, the consensus wallahs, the stiffers and fixers, should know things the electorate must not be told.

In other news, the Crimea got to have a vote on whether or not to join Europe. Lucky devils.

Oh, and it was International  Women’s Day. A special debate was held in Westminster Hall. MPs made references to it. The House of Lords went almost entirely mad about it, cutting the men out  of question time. The politics of patronising gestures.
