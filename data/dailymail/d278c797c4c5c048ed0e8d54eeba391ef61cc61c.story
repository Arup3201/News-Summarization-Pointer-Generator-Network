A Danish tourist has died after trying to save a Michigan mayor from tempestuous waves on a beach in the Virgin Islands.

South Lyon Mayor Tedd Wallace was pulled under the water while body-boarding in St Croix last Sunday.

Rushing to his rescue was 70-year-old Gvind Matson, a Danish man on holiday with his wife to celebrate the 50th anniversary of their first kiss.

Mr Wallace, 63, said Mr Matson also got caught in the choppy waters and as they both tried to cling to the board, he lost grip and never resurfaced.

Tribute: Mr Wallace posted this tribute to Mr Matson on Sunday afternoon after speaking to his widow

'He didn't hesitate and took off after me,' Mr Wallace told The Detroit News.

'When he got to me we were both hanging on to the board and trying to paddle towards shore. I don't think we even said anything to each other. Suddenly he let go and went under. I think he had a heart attack right then.'

He added: 'I feel so sorry for that man.

'Someone who gave their life for me ... I've been doing a lot of crying this week.'

Another man, Bale Shbaka Kaza, eventually spotted Mr Wallace and rescued him from the rocky-based ocean with bare feet.

Mr Matson's widow, Annette, said he likely had an epileptic seizure.

Mr Wallace said the waves were so powerful they pulled off his wedding ring off his finger.

Bale Shbaka Kaza, a local businessman from one of the island's larger cities, was able to pull Wallace to safety.

Writing on Facebook, Mr Wallace, a retired teacher, said: 'I want to say thankyou to so many unbelievable good wishes sent me and for prayers offered to Danish man Gvind Matson and family in his valiant effort to rescue me from the rip tide. 

'I am so sad. 

'His widow Annette sent me a kind email and said he may have had epilepsy seizure at the moment he arrived to me explaining his sudden plunge below surface. 

'Bale Shakabaka was my other hero who for reasons he can't figure why had climbed up on rocks and spotted the trouble and scaled 200 feet of sharp rocks in bare feet to reach out and save me. 

'Thankyou (sic) for all concerned friends and strangers a like.'
