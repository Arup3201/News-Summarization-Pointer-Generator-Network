French cyclist Francois Gissy has long been riding rocket-powered bikes but he broke his own world speed record last Friday when he reached a heart-pounding 207 miles per hour.

Gissy captured the moment on film comparing his takeoff to that of a comparatively sluggish Ferrari.

It took just 5 seconds for him to go from 0 to 207 miles per hour.

In doing so he trails a mushrooming cloud of white smoke and onlookers cheer. 

Gissy's previous record was set in May 2013 when he reached 163 miles per hour.

As Gizmodo noted, that's three times the speed limit on many US interstates.

This new record was set at Circuit Paul Ricard in the south of France. 

The bike was built by Exotic Thermo Engineering, a Swiss company.
