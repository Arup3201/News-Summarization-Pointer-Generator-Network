'Matt's 
family is devastated,' the source said. 'His parents worry he may have

 He had plans for a major career, he wanted to do well.

'He and Becca were madly in love and talked marriage and having a family. She is inconsolable.

'He
 was a great guy, totally clean, didn't  do drugs, he was just extreme 
ambitious which his family fears led to his death. It's very sad because
 Becca was so in love and saw a long future with him.'

Cory Monteith, who died of a drug overdose at the age of 31 in July last

A maid reportedly found his body in the room on Thursday afternoon.

At the

nightclub and its Avertine restaurant, and he ran one of West Hollywood's hottest night spots, DBA.

The club paid tribute to him on Thursday night following his passing with a sign expressing the staff's love for him.

The
 AV Nightclub is said to be one of the toughest venues to gain entry to 
with patrons including Chris Brown, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Ne-Yo.

The 
club has hosted DJs from Afrojack to Avicii to Kristina Kova. He was also 'Director of Nightlife' at the Modern Honolulu Hotel’s ADDICTION nightclub.

His first foray into the party scene came in 1997 when he was 14 years old.

He strutted over to a group of high school seniors who organized weekly parties in a shuttered church in Hollywood.

Matt Bendik’s death comes almost a year to the day after his girlfriend’s Glee co-star Cory Monteith (right) died in a Vancouver Hotel room last summer.

Monteith’s body was found in a room at the Vancouver Canada hotel on July 13 shortly after midday.

A coroner’s report revealed the 31-year-old actor – who played Finn Hudson on the hit Fox television series - was taking heroin and drinking champagne alone in his hotel room on the night of his death.

He and his manager dined on the Thursday night before his death with Maureen Webb, the co-founder of Project Limelight Society, who said the actor 'looked so good, so healthy'.

According to authorities, Monteith and three unidentified people left his hotel room on the Friday night and the actor returned alone at around 2:15 a.m. Hotel staff found his body shortly after noon when Monteith didn't check out.

On May 11 this year, which would have been his 32nd birthday, Monteith's girlfriend and Glee co-star Lea Michele paid tribute to her boyfriend, tweeting: 'The biggest heart and most beautiful smile.. In all of our hearts.. We love you so. Happy Birthday.’

‘I wanted to be a cool kid,’ he told The Modern Honolulu. ‘[So] I said to them, “You guys are the coolest. How can I help? I want to learn.” One older boy, who arranged the rental of the church for their late-night DJ all-ages party, said “Come back here after the party and we'll start you out.” I showed up at 2 a.m. and they handed me a stack of garbage bags.’

He spent the rest of the school year tidying up after hard-partying seniors.

But when the year came to an end, the seniors graduated and offered to sell him their ‘business’ for a few hundred dollars.

He bought their party list, the contract to the church rental, some DJ equipment and speakers and set out to continue organising parties for teenagers four years older than him.

By his sophomore year he was raking in tens of thousands of dollars throwing parties for students.

That same year, he was approached by Whiskey a Go-Go on The Sunset Strip to take over promoting their Monday night all-ages show. He was still only 15 years old.

It was 
then that his mother suggested he applied for the Cornell University 
School of Hotel Administration in upstate New York, he told the Hawaiian
 paper.

After
 graduating he spent the next four years learning the ins and outs of 
event planning while putting on nights at a string of New York and Los 
Angeles’ most exclusive nightclubs.

He
 then got a job in a nightclub in Las Vegas. ‘I barbacked. I swept 
basements in hazmat suits in the blazing desert heat. I worked the door.
 I cut fruit. You name it,’ he said.
