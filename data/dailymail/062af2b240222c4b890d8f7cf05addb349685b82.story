Russia and the U.S. disagree on how to end the conflict in Syria - but both want the bloodshed to stop and the warring parties brought to the negotiating table, Vladimir Putin said today.

Russian President Mr Putin admitted after talks with U.S. President Barack Obama at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland that 'our positions do not fully coincide'.

He added: 'But we are united by the common intention to end the violence, to stop the number of victims increasing in Syria, to resolve the problems by peaceful means, including the Geneva talks.'

Tense: U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland

Looking tense and staring mostly at the 
floor, he said: ‘We agreed to push the process of peace talks and 
encourage the parties to sit down at the negotiation table, organise the
talks in Geneva.’

He added: ‘Of course our opinions do not coincide, but all of us have 
the intention to stop the violence in Syria and to stop the growth of 
victims and to solve the situation peacefully’.

Mr Obama, 51, conceded he has a ‘different perspective’ to the Russian 
President on Syria, but they have a shared interest in stopping the 
violence and securing chemical weapons in the country.

He said: ‘We share an interest in reducing the violence, securing 
chemical weapons and ensuring that they're neither used nor are they 
subject to proliferation.’

While Mr Putin has called for negotiated peace talks, he has not called 
for Syrian President Bashar Assad to leave power, and he remains one of 
the leader's strongest political and military allies.

The White House did not expect any breakthrough with Mr Putin on Syria 
during the G8 meeting and it further highlighted the rift between the 
two countries on how to address the fighting.

Mr Obama announced on Friday that the U.S. would start sending weaponry,
while Britain and France remained concerned that the firepower might 
end up helping anti-democratic extremists linked to Iran and Lebanon's 
Hezbollah militia.

Mr Putin has defended Russia's continuing supply of weapons to Assad's military.

At least 93,000 people have been killed in Syria's conflict since it 
erupted in March 2011, according to a recent U.N. estimate. Millions 
have been displaced.

Mr Obama also said he and Mr Putin, 60, expressed cautious optimism 
about the ability to move forward on a dialogue with Iran after a 
moderate cleric was elected president there.
