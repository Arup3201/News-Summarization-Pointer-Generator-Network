He was reduced to floods of tears after his team was thrashed 7-1 by Germany on home soil in a result that broke Brazilian hearts.

But after Brazil captain David Luiz wept uncontrollably in the wake of his team’s devastating capitulation in the World Cup semi-finals, he has received some welcome support – in the form of an adorable letter from a young fan.

The former Chelsea defender, wearing the skipper’s armband in the absence of Thiago Silva, cried as he said ‘I just wanted to see my people smile’ after Brazil’s hopes of winning the tournament on home turf were dashed in humiliating fashion.

Ana Luz, nine, sent David Luiz this touching letter urging the multi-million pound defender not to be too sad in the wake of Brazil's humiliating defeat

But his show of emotion after the final whistle had blown, prompted nine-year-old Ana Luz to pen him a letter - telling him not to be sad.

The child even showed he was still her sporting hero by drawing a small picture of him holding a trophy aloft.

Luiz, 27, who left Chelsea for Parish St Germain earlier this summer, was so touched by the letter that he posted it on Instagram.

He wrote: ‘Many thanks princess Ana Luz, loved your letter!

'And thanks to all Brazilians for all the support!

'I'll never give up my dreams, and I will always strive to give back all that love I receive! God bless you all!’

In her letter, she explained that she had watched all of Brazil’s games and ‘liked it a lot watching you play’.

She added: ‘I think that you don't need to be sad because you played well and did the best you could. You were a great captain.

 Hi David Luiz,My name is Ana Luz. I saw all of the Brazil games in the World Cup and I liked it a lot watching you play.

I think that you don't need to be sad because you played well and did the best you could. You were a great captain.

Life is like this, sometimes people lose and sometimes people win but people only need to be happy.

David Luiz, you are my champion.

‘Life is like this, sometimes people lose and sometimes people win but people only need to be happy.

‘David Luiz, you are my champion.’

Germany blew Brazil away in a sensational 18-minute spell in the first-half that yielded five goals - two from Toni Kroos and one apiece for Thomas Muller, Miroslav Klose and Sami Khedira.

Klose's goal saw him overtake Brazil legend Ronaldo as the leading goalscorer in World Cup tournaments, with 16 now to his name.

Substitute Andre Schurrle added two further goals after the break to extend the lead to seven, before Oscar scored a late consolation.

Brazil’s World Cup campaign will come to an end tonight after they face the Netherlands in a third place play-off at the Estadio Nacional in Brasilia.

The tournament finally reaches its climax tomorrow when Argentina take on Germany in the Maracana Stadium, Rio de Janeiro.
