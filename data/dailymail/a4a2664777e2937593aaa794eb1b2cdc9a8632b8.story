Three 'utterly depraved' paedophiles - a married couple and another woman - have been jailed for a total of 14-and-a-half years after plotting to inflict horrific sexual abuse on children.

Kevin and Susan Barnett, along with Nikita Moore, were convicted of sharing plans to rape and sexually assault young children in June 2014, via online messaging service WhatsApp, after a two-and-a-half week trial in December.

Both women - the ex-wife and lover - moved in together after Barnett left them for another woman and they both went along with his paedophilic desires in a bid to win him back, a court heard.

Barnett, aged 28, of Barrow, Cumbria, received a six-year prison sentence for one count of arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sexual offence, jointly with his wife Susan, 28, and two counts of conspiracy to commit a child sexual offence, jointly with 22-year-old co-defendant Nikita Moore.

The two female defendants, who were living together, sobbed in court as Susan was handed a four-and-a-half year sentence and Moore a four year sentence.

Judge Christopher Cornwall, passing sentence at Preston Crown Court today, described how extreme sexual exchanges between Barnett and the two women descended into plans to abuse children.

He said: 'By this time you had all sunk so low and your thinking was so distorted that all basic, fundamental morality protecting children from adult sexual provision was simply absent.'

Susan  was told it was to her 'eternal shame' that she did not react with 'outrage' to her husband's twisted suggestions.

Moore, who began an affair with Barnett following the funeral of her partner in October 2013, shared 'violent sexual fantasies' with him involving giving birth to a child for them to abuse together.

She also shared indecent photos of children, and spoke of her desire to see him rape a young child.

Judge Cornwall said: 'The offences were committed in quite extraordinary circumstances in which two women were so desperate to rekindle their relationships with Kevin Barnett, that they were prepared to indulge his every terrible whim.

'The content of the messages was truly horrific and utterly depraved.'

Judge Cornwall accepted that other than indecent images being shared, there was no evidence that any other physical abuse was enacted on children by the three defendants.

Barnett was described as a 'baneful influence' on the two women, and was said to have 'little understanding' of the harm he had caused.

Sentencing Susan, Judge Cornwall said: 'You have a heavy burden to carry which you will be judged on for some considerable time to come.'

Regard was given to mental health issues suffered by Moore, stemming from the loss of her baby two hours after its birth when she was 14 years old.

The court heard she met Barnett at an 'extremely low ebb.'

The trio were arrested after an 18-year-old woman, who was in a relationship with Kevin Barnett, tipped police off about messages she had read on his phone.

As well as the conspiracy and facilitation offences, Barnett and Moore were sentenced to six months, running concurrently with their other prison sentences, for possession of indecent images of children.

The Barnett's each received six month concurrent sentences for possession of extreme pornographic images involving sexual activity with dogs and horses.

All three defendants were banned from working with children and ordered to sign the sex offender's register indefinitely.

They also received a Sexual Offences Prevention Order placing severe restrictions on any future use of the internet, computers or devices capable of digitally storing images.

The conspiracy emerged by chance in June when Barnett found himself arrested over a domestic disturbance at a third woman's address.

At that time he was said to be in a relationship with his wife Susan and Moore, both living at the marital address.

The court heard the Barnetts had married in June 2013, but then separated early this year.

Prosecutor Charles Brown said that in the course of graphic text message conversations with each other, the Barnetts had made arrangements and had discussed possible sexual abuse by  Barnett, with her indicating she would assist in the commission of those acts.

Mr Brown said there were messages of a sexual nature between those two defendants which progressed to discussing sexual abuse.

Mr Brown added: 'The conversations with Susan Barnett were taking place at the same time and often almost simultaneously with text conversations between Kevin Barnett and Nikita Moore.'

Matters progressed with the two women seeking a relationship with the male defendant. The court was told before separating from his wife, Barnett had had a sexual relationship with Moore for three months.

Barnett and Moore agreed together to engage in sexual activity with children. It was an escalating course of conduct between those two defendants, during which in text messages he requested her to perform a variety of sexual acts.

Mr Brown said: 'In further mobile text messages they agreed and discussed in detail abusing children. The inference is Nikita Moore had been prepared to carry out his ever extreme sexual requests. The messages planning these sexual acts with children represented a genuine plan of action.'

Nikita Moore, who was Barnett's girlfriend, told him she had had thoughts about sexually abusing a child

The night before his arrest, Barnett had had a sexual liaison with his wife and Moore.

In June this year, he was at the home of the third woman, but was texting his wife and Moore. Police were called to a domestic disturbance and Barnett was arrested, initially to prevent a breach of the peace. She indicated he was no longer welcome at her home and drew police attention to text messages she had seen on his mobile phone. She had been suspicious he intended resuming a relationship with his wife.

Mr Brown added: 'They saw the conversations in which Susan Barnett had agreed to facilitate and assist in sexual activity with a child.'

Her phone was then seized, as well as that of Moore. All the phones were analysed. Some discussions were found that had taken place between Moore and Barnett.

Mr Brown added: 'They discussed how they could gain access to children.'

Barnett suggested she could get a job in child care. Moore disclosed to him she had had thoughts of sexually abusing a child, which he encouraged.

'It's a highly sexualised world in which he appears to live. He is lost in a world of unusual sexual practices where nothing appears to be ruled out.'

Mr Brown said Susan and Moore were 'besotted' with Barnett and willing to assist him. 

Acting Detective Inspector Brian Murray, of the South Cumbria Public Protection Unit, said: 'I am pleased that justice has been served today and these three individuals will be facing prison for their crimes.

'Thankfully cases like this are extremely rare in Cumbria and the quick arrests of these three people once information came to light show that we are committed to protecting children in Cumbria.'

After the case, prosecutor Charles Brown said: 'Susan Barnett, Kevin Barnett and Nikita Moore have been found guilty of extremely alarming offences whereby they planned amongst themselves the sexual abuse of vulnerable young children.

'They sent shockingly explicit messages to each other, including photographs of the children they planned to abuse, over a prolonged period of ten days. The messages shown during the trial proved that the abuse was intended to be made real and would have been put into action once the opportunity arose.

'All three defendants denied they intended to carry out the abuse they had discussed and attempted to explain it away as general talk about sexual fantasies. However, after carefully considering all the evidence against them, the jury has today found them guilty of all the repugnant offences they faced.

'The CPS and Police are dedicated to protecting children and young people, and will continue to do all in our power to bring to justice all those who harm them or plan to harm them in any way.'
