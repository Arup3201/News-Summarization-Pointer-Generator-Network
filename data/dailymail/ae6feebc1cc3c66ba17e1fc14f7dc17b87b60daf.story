An underpants company has designed a range of briefs, boxers and shorties which use chemical warfare technology to filter flatulence.

And there's no need to feel embarrassed about buying them - even Chelsea player Frank Lampard has a pair.

Unisex: Shreddies flatulence-absorbing underwear comes in a range of styles for men and women

Shreddies - no relation to the breakfast cereal - feature a special, highly porous carbon cloth back panel which works by absorbing, trapping and neutralising flatulence odours.

The thin, flexible cloth - the same activated carbon material used in chemical warfare suits - is then reactivated simply by washing the pants and does not need replacing.

The award-winning underwear is suitable for both men in women and comes in a range of styles, all of which are meant to fit the body more snugly than conventional underwear.

Women can buy Shreddies in briefs, high-leg briefs or shorties, while men can purchase support boxers, adjustable support boxers, hipsters and briefs.

The hi-tech underpants - which are now being advertised in women's magazines as 'a girl's best friend' - are particularly useful for sufferers of digestive disorders such as IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome), Crohn's disease, Dyspepsia, Colitis and food intolerances, or those suffering the after effects of bowel surgery.

Now and then: Shreddies - pairs of which are 
owned by Christine Bleakley and Frank Lampard, left - function using the
 same technology employed in chemical warfare suits

There are many flatulence relief 
remedies on the market - including pills and charcoal tablets - but no 
effective anti-flatulence treatment for sufferers of such complaints, 
and Shreddies offer a proven method of removing the odour of excessive 
bad gas.

Customers who have
 used Shreddies - which won the Look Good Feel Good Award at the 
Association For Incontinence Advice awards in 2009 - have commented on 
their website, with one man saying his wife calls them his 'socialising 
underwear'.

Another, 
Jennifer A from Newcastle, says: 'They're an answer to a prayer, 
absolutely fantastic, so effective and discreet. I only wish they'd been
 invented 40 years ago!

'I 
know the problems they address are usually the subject of a joke, but 
it's no joke if you actually suffer from them, just the reverse.

'It's
 marvellous to have the security they provide, both at work and 
socially, in fact in every situation. I'm so glad someone came up with 
this idea and will definitely be ordering some more.'

How they work: Shreddies underpants function by filtering flatulence through a thin, highly porous carbon cloth

Shreddies previously featured on breakfast TV show Daybreak, during a segment in which presenters Adrian Chiles and Christine Bleakley pretended to squabble over a men's pair.

In the end, Chiles took the underpants home, but Shreddies spokesman Ianthe Betts-Clarke said: 'Christine was really trying her best to get her hands on the pants but with very little success because Adrian Chiles really wasn't letting go.

'Since their pant-related tiff Christine has requested that we send her over her very own pair of flatulence filtering underwear and one for her other half - of course we were more than obliged to do so.'

Shreddies also design underwear for people suffering from incontinence and those with stomas and colostomy bags.
