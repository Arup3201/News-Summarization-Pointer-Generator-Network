Darren Fletcher completes West Bromwich Albion move on three-and-a-half year deal

Man United sign Bolton defender Andy Kellett on loan for the rest of the season

Wilfried Zaha returns to Crystal Palace after Eagles seal £6m permanent transfer

Milton Keynes 4-0 Manchester United. August 26, 2014. A dark day in the history of one of Europe's great clubs, and a dark day for Louis van Gaal.

Many poked fun at United's plight after the Capital One Cup fixture, but since that game, Van Gaal has got down to work in removing the outcasts from his squad.

In fact, Wilfried Zaha and Saidy Janko's departures on transfer deadline day mean that half of the players who made the trip to stadium:MK have since left the club.

'I am not shocked because I know what can happen,' Van Gaal said after the defeat. 'A new team is not built in one month.'

Five months on, and his revolution is in full swing.  Only David de Gea, Jonny Evans, Reece James and Nick Powell from the starting XI have survived the Dutch manager's axe. 

Michael Keane started at centre back that day but is now at Burnley, Marnick Vermijl plies his trade at Sheffield Wednesday, Javier Hernandez and Shinji Kagawa signed for Real Madrid and Dortmund on loan respectively, Danny Welbeck was a summer deadline day departure to Arsenal, while Anderson has left the club and looks set to join Internacional.

Janko is highly thought of at Old Trafford and his loan move to Bolton should be more a process of getting minutes, rather than giving up hope on the 19-year-old Swiss youth international.

Ben Amos, an unused substitute in Milton Keynes, has also been called upon by Wanderers on an emergency goalkeeping loan. But it is another case from the bench from that day that has drawn most attention; Zaha's permanent switch to Crystal Palace being confirmed. 

Zaha's attitude was questioned at Old Trafford and he managed just 28 Premier League minutes at the club

'Zaha's application and attitude – at least among last season's management set-up at United – was never considered to be right,' Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman says.  

The winger, who has impressed in south London where he was brought up this season, managed just 28 Premier League minutes with United under David Moyes - 22 against Newcastle and six against Aston Villa.

Since then, Van Gaal has usually stuck to picking his best players available, albeit with introducing a few new faces alongside his seasoned pros.

Victories at Yeovil and a draw at Cambridge were accomplished with near full-strength XIs, indicating Van Gaal just doesn't trust the majority of his squad. Once you fail an audition like many did against MK Dons, you're out the door.

United finished deadline day with just one signing, the virtually unknown full back Andy Kellett on loan from Bolton, but the summer is expected to be much busier for Ed Woodward and Van Gaal. 

By then his revolution may well be complete.
