Racist slurs abusing Asian women have started to appear on the campus of a leading US university, prompting police to launch an investigation.

The sexist messages were discovered over the last week on UCLA's campus.

One of the messages found at the Californian university described Asian women as 'Honkie white-boy worshipping W****s [sic]'.

The message was attached to a sign for the university's Vietnamese Student Union (VSU).

A similar message was found in a campus toilet, once again aimed at Asian women.

It read: 'Asian Women are White-Boy Worshipping S***s.'

Asians are the largest ethnic group 
at the university, making up 34 percent of all enrolled undergraduate students.

In 2011 Alexandra Wallace, a UCLA student, posted an infamous online rant called 'Asians in the Library'.

Antonette Sadile, a student who found one of the messages, said: 'I thought [Tuesday’s 
incident] was a more personal attack. But this is a bigger impact. It is really scary. I didn’t 
feel safe.'

Uyen Hoang, the VSU's external vice president, told ABC: 'When I woke up on Tuesday, the last thing I expected was to have racist and sexist slurs continuously thrown at my organisation, my community, and at my face, and at UCLA of all places.'

UCLA spokesman Steve Ritea said said: 'We share the students’ anger and sadness and condemn 
this incident.'

He also described the incidents as isolated, saying they were unrelated to other incidents on the campus.

Latino students at the university were targeted earlier this year, when the door of their off-campus apartment was scrawled with insults, referring to them as 'rude ignorant spic c****' and 'dirty Meximelt b*****s'.

Roman Nguyen, president of the Vietnamese Student 
Union, told the campus newspaper: 'It shows this is what some people actually think.'

Nearly 200 people attended a rally at the university on Thursday over racist incidents at the university.
