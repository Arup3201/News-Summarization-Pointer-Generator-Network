Malcom Turnbull and Alan Jones exchanged fiery words on radio this morning, when the broadcaster told the federal communications minister that he had 'no hope ever' of becoming the leader of the Liberal Party.

Mr Turnbull and Mr Jones were involved in a heated exchange, which resulted in the minister telling the radio personality that he was a 'bomb thrower' who could dish it out but couldn't take it.

The interview started by Mr Jones telling Mr Turnbull to 'say after me' that he supported the controversial budget, announced last month.

'I am not going to take dictation from you': Alan Jones started his interview by trying to make Malcolm Turnbull repeat after him that he supported the government's budget

The controversial radio host told the federal communications minister that he was causing problems in the Liberal Party by meeting with Clive Palmer

'Alan, I am not going to take dictation from you, I am a cabinet minister,' said Mr Turnbull. Though Mr Turnbull went on to say that he 'unreservedly' supported the budget.

AJ: Malcolm, I've coached Australia in rugby. If one of my players on the eve of the rugby test was seen socialising, having dinner, privately inviting a member of the All Blacks, on the eve of a test match, the player would be sent home, Malcolm.

MT: Well, this is not football. We are not playing football.MT: Yourself, Andrew Bolt in particular, have set out to suggest there is dissension in the government, that there are challenges to his leadership –

AJ: No there's no challenge to his leadership… precisely because you have no hope, ever, of being the leader. You've got to get that into your head. No hope ever. But because of that you're happy to chuck a few bombs around to blow up Abbott a bit, that's what they're saying.

MT:  This is the most united, cohesive government we've had in this country for a long time and I think it's just very sad that you and Bolt are doing the work of the Labor Party in undermining the Abbott government.

AJ: Oh, so we're the bomb throwers?

MT: You are, Alan, you are.

AJ: I see.

MT: Let's assume [Palmer] is standing in the way of our budget repair… Do you think the best way to get him out of the way, Alan, is to abuse him in the sort of language you're abusing me with?

AJ: I'm not abusing you.

MT: [laughs] Oh really? I don't think any of your listeners would be under that misapprehension.

AJ: You've got a few sensitive nerves there Malcolm!

MT: Alan, the problem with you is that you like dishing it out but you don't like taking it.

Mr Jones then turned the conversation to Liberal leadership speculation.

Rumours have intensified this week that Mr Turnbull, who lost the leadership of the Liberal Party to Tony Abbott in 2009, might be making a tilt for the top job after he ate dinner with Clive Palmer and was vocally supportive of the ABC.

'You have no hope ever of being the leader, you have got to get that into your head,' said Mr Jones.  dd

'No hope ever. But because of that you're happy to chuck a few bombs around that might blow up Abbott a bit. That's what they're saying.'

Mr Turnbull responded by saying he was 'distressed' that conservative commentators such as Mr Jones and Andrew Bolt had suggested there was division in the Liberal Party and that he and Prime Minister Tony Abbott were a team.

This is the second stoush Mr Turnbull has engaged in with conservative press this week.

Earlier in the week he responded heatedly to an article from Andrew Bolt, which accused Mr Turnbull of trying to destabilise Tony Abbott in a bid to become leader of the party.

Mr Turnbull's frontbench colleagues have come to his defence.

In response to a question in parliament after Bolt's column was published, about whether Mr Abbott would support his 'friend' Andrew Bolt or his 'frenemy' Malcolm Turnbull, Tony Abbott replied: 'In any dispute between a member of my frontbench and a member of the fourth estate I am firmly on the side of my frontbencher.'

Treasurer Joe Hockey defended Mr Turnbull on Thursday after the interview with Alan Jones.

'Malcolm is putting in a huge effort as we all are in endeavouring to focus on the policies of the budget rather than the politics,' Mr Hockey told Sky News.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said he believed Mr Turnbull doth protest too much', and there was clearly division in the Liberal Party.
