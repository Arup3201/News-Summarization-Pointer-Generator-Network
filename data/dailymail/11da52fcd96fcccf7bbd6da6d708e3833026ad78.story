Warning: Assistant Commissioner of the Met police Cressida Dick says the consequences of the conflict in Syria - and the return of British-born jihadists - will be felt in the UK for many years

Britain will feel the repercussions of Syria and the rise of Islamic extremism within its own borders for 'many years' to come, a top counter-terrorism   expert has said.

Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan Police's assistant commissioner and head of specialist operations, warned that Britain would feel the long-term   consequences of the conflict.

She said it represented a terrorist threat to the UK, and that young British Muslims who have travelled to the war-torn country to fight might   commit violence when they return.

'I'm afraid I believe that we will be living with the consequences of Syria - from a terrorist point   of view, let alone the world, geopolitical consequences - for many, many, many years to come,' Ms Dick told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend.

Her warning came after footage emerged online apparently showing several young British jihadists in Syria in a recruitment video for the extremist   militant group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (Isis), in which they urge UK Muslims to join insurgents there and in Iraq.

Two have been identified as brothers from Cardiff - 20-year-old Nasser Muthana, and 17-year-old Aseel Muthana. Another has been identified as Reyaad Khan, 20, a former pupil at Cardiffâ€™s Cantonian High School.

Two other men were arrested in March and April in the UK after they returned from Syria.

The pair, aged 19 and 23 and both also from Cardiff, were held   on suspicion of receiving terrorist training and attending a place used for terrorist training, but were later released without charge.

South Wales Police said in a statement: 'We are increasingly concerned about the numbers of young people who have or are intending to travel to Syria   to join the conflict.

'The advice is to avoid all travel to Syria - anyone who does travel is putting themselves in considerable danger.

'Travelling abroad for the purpose of   engaging in terrorist related activity is an offence and we will seek to prosecute anyone engaged in this type of activity.

'The issue is not unique to Cardiff or Wales and is a priority for police and security services across the UK.'

Police across the UK have made 65 Syria-related arrests over the last 18 months, including 40 in the first three months of this year alone.

Shadow 
justice secretary Sadiq Khan warned that radicalisation in prisons was a
 big problem and described the inadequacy of training for prison staff 
to deal with the issue as 'shocking'.

Mr
 Khan said mosques do a good job in educating young people and called on
 the Government to concentrate on the spaces it can govern, such as 
prisons.

He
 told Sky News's Murnaghan programme: 'You speak to prison governors, as
 I do, prison officers, as I do - the inadequacy of the training is 
quite shocking.

Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan warned that radicalisation in prisons was a big problem and called on greater efforts to combat it

'But also their inability to tackle this problem is a big issue and we should be doing much, much more.'There's
 no point in politicians from this Government coming on with their heads
 in their hands, blaming parents or mosques - important roles that they 
have to play as well.'

Earlier,
 he told the programme: 'The mosques actually do a good job. Actually 
most mums and dads don't want their young sons, we've seen the father of
 the two sons in Cardiff, being radicalised.

'The problem is with the internet now, with social media, with Twitter.

'Our
 ability as parents or as governors of a mosque are less than they were 
and we've got to redouble our efforts to stop the source, these 
preachers of hate, getting into people's bedrooms.

'I
 think we've got to recognise that if you are a young person born and 
raised in this country and the first time somebody shows you a role 
model is a bearded man with a Kalashnikov in Afghanistan, or somebody 
doing bad things in Syria or Iraq, it's a problem.'

Yesterday it emerged that around 500 Britons had travelled to Syria and Iraq - a higher estimate than the 400 claimed by Foreign Secretary William   Hague.

Sir Peter Fahy, who leads on the Prevent counter-terrorism strategy for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said 'huge amounts of material' was   being taken down from the internet every week as part of the effort to stop people being radicalised.

Another terrorism expert warned that it is 'inevitable' that jihadists returning from Syria and Iraq will pose a threat in Britain, saying that   hundreds may have already returned.

Richard Barrett, a former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, estimated that 'possibly up to 300 people have come back to the UK' already, and warned   that intelligence services faced an 'impossible' task in trying to track them.

He told The Independent on Sunday: 'If you imagine what it would cost to really look at 300 people in depth, clearly it would be completely impossible   to do that, probably impossible even at a third of that number.'

Mr Barrett said police and intelligence resources were stretched in terms of numbers and knowing where the returning jihadists are.

He said: 'With this whole business in Syria, although there is no linear projection from foreign fighters to domestic terrorists, it's inevitable that   a number will fall into this category.'

Mr Barrett has co-authored a report, released this month, which concludes that more than 12,000 foreign fighters have gone to Syria since the war   began, and that it is 'likely to be an incubator for a new generation of terrorists'.

Meanwhile the father of the Muthana brothers said his sons, both high achievers at school with good career prospects, must have been 'brainwashed' and   believes a network of radical jihadi recruiters must have paid for them to go.

Mr Muthana said that he and his wife were 'devastated' when they found out from police in November that their eldest son Nasser had joined a terror   cell in Syria.

In February police informed them their second son, Aseel, had obtained a second passport and travelled to Cyprus and was planning to join   his brother.

Nasser was reported to have passed 14 GCSEs, was studying for his A-levels and had been offered places to study medicine at four universities before he   became radicalised.

His brother Aseel was an A-level student at Fitzalan High School in Cardiff and had dreams of becoming an English teacher.

Mr Muthana, 57 who came to the UK in the 1970s from Yemen, told the Sunday Telegraph:
 'I feel sick and devastated my son is caught up in this - they were 
brought   up to love and respect my country Britain. Now I fear they may
 come back in coffins.

'I'm
 worried about their safety. But I am also worried about the evil 
messages Nasser is spreading in this vile video - I am concerned that 
other boys   may follow him there.'

The
 brothers were part of a wider terror network that included two friends 
arrested months ago after they returned from the Middle East.

Yesterday
 thousands of young British Muslim men rallied against radical Islam 
amid the concerns that British jihadists are fighting in Syria.

An
 estimated 5,000 Muslims gathered in Surrey to pledge loyalty to Britain
 in light of concerns over the popularity of Isis and the alleged 
involvement   of Britons.

The
 three-day residential event, organised by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth 
Association (Amya), has brought together 5,000 young British Muslim men 
from   England, Scotland and Wales, to foster bonds of brotherhood and 
affirm their pride in being British and Muslim.

Recruitment video: Nasser Muthana urges Britons to take up arms and join ISIS militants in Iraq and Syria

The
 young Welsh muslim in a terror-recruiting video that has stunned his 
family was radicalised over the internet, a senior figure at his mosque 
has said.

Muslims in 
Cardiff were in shock yesterday as former medical student Nasser 
Muthana, 20, from Cardiff, was revealed to be one of the men in a video 
posted posted from Syria by accounts with links to Islamist militant 
group ISIS.

A
 second man from Cardiff is also believed to be in the video urging 
young British muslims to join the fight in Syria alongside Muthana's 
younger brother Aseel, 17.

Saleem
 Kidwai, general secretary of the leading Muslim body, said he believed 
there were as many as five Welsh muslims already fighting in Syria and 
Iraq with the now-outlawed terror group Isis.

The
 mosque where Muthana worshipped yesterday denied being a source of 
radicalism and said that young people were being turned to extremism 
through the internet.

Barak
 Albayaty, a trustee at the mosque, the Al Manar Centre, said that 
Muthana had been 'just like any other guy' and he had been shocked to 
see him in the video.

He said: 'What I'm sure of, being part of here, it's not to be taken as a source of radicalism.'We're against going to Syria for the armed struggle and have spelt this out on many occasions.'

He added: 'It is worrying. We have to do something collective about the media and how these youths are getting affected.

'They're
 affected by the internet. It's not just Cardiff, it's all over the UK. 
I'm told the numbers could be in the hundreds all over the UK.'

Mr
 Albayaty said there would be a meeting between trustees who will 
discuss the issue. He added that he felt for Muthana's parents and added
 that members of the mosque were out in the community yesterday, picking
 up litter.

Mr Albayaty said: 'It's very important to show that we're open.'
