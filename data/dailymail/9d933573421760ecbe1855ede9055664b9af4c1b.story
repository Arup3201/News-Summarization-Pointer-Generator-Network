The war of words continues between two of Britain's most talented boxers as Billy Joe Saunders demands Chris Eubank Jnr beats Gary 'Spike' O'Sullivan for the rematch to become a possibility.  

It was just five months ago that Eubank Jnr and Saunders walked into the ExCel Arena to do battle for the British, Commonwealth and European middleweight titles and it appears there's no love lost between the pair.

Unbeaten Saunders defeated the son of boxing legend Chris Eubank Snr on points, in a match-up which could have gone either way.

The spat show that their is no love lost between the feuding pair and a rematch is very much on the agenda

Their feud was ongoing up until the bout and it's shown no signs of letting up since - if their latest Twitter bust-up is anything to go by. 

Saunders reignited the argument by tweeting Eubank Jnr and provoking him into a reaction over commenting about a potential fight with Gary 'Spike' O'Sullivan - calling him a 'bottlejob.'

Eubank was quick to fire back and stated that he'd defeat O'Sullivan before coming for Saunders and a potential rematch.

These tweets transcended into chaos as both fighters went toe-to-toe in an online argument with insults instead of punches being exchanged. 

The boxers continued to exchange insults to keep their ongoing disagreement going after their match

It leaves open the door for a rematch to be agreed and after gaining the attention of the Twitter-sphere - it's sure to be a fight that the boxing world wants to see.  

Saunders is yet to fight since dispatching of Eubank Jnr, with the Hatfield-boxer turned down a shot of the IBF middleweight title to honour his vow to fight for the WBO.

Eubank has been quick to try get career back on track after losing his unbeaten record to his rival and stopped Dmitry Chudinov of Russia at the O2 Arena in February. 

Eubank's final tweet to Saunders was sure to get under his skin as the online battle between them exploded
