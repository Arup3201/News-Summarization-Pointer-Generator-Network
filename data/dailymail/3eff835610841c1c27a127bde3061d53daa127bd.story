Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is predicting Daniel Sturridge’s return to fitness will transform his side’s season - as the Anfield club set their sights on a move for Danny Ings.

England striker Sturridge last kicked a ball for Liverpool 152 days ago but, having recovered from a serious thigh problem, he will be included in the squad for Saturdays Barclays Premier League home clash with West Ham.

Rodgers has suffered without having a striker who can intensely press defenders, but Sturridge will give him that presence and Liverpool are looking to supplement that by moving for Burnley’s Ings.

Spurs and Real Sociedad are among a number of clubs to express an interest in 22-year-old Ings, who will be a free agent at the end of the current campaign, but Liverpool are looking to trump their rivals and secure a deal for him now.

If they are successful, Ings would be immediately loaned back to Burnley to help them in their fight to stay in the top flight before moving to Anfield in the summer, like Divock Origi, who is on loan back at Lille. Rodgers said there were ‘one or two things’ he would like to do if possible before the window closes but a more immediate concern is the return of Sturridge.

‘He will bring something really creative and quality to the team,’ said Rodgers.

‘Daniel not playing has had a huge impact. Over the last number of months we have nailed down a way of working and when Daniel is put in that it shines a different light on it.

‘He has been fast, dynamic, sharp. But we have to be careful. We can’t expect him to be the saving grace straight away.’

Sturridge spent three weeks over Christmas in Los Angeles and Boston, where he worked with specialists to bolster his left thigh muscle. The time away from Melwood gave him a sense of perspective.

‘It has been a learning curve,’ said Sturridge. ‘They have allowed me to learn something, (being on the sidelines) has been great for the mental side of the game.

‘I have improved that and now I am very, very anxious to get out there and play. I don’t know what people’s expectations are. I can only speak for my expectations, which are to work hard, score goals and create chances. If the team plays well it is enough for me.’
