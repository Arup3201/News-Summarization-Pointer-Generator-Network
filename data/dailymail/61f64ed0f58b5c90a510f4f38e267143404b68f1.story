A California appeals courts has ruled that spanking a child with a wooden spoon is not abuse, setting an surprising legal precedent.

The 6th District Court of Appeal in San Jose yesterday reversed the child abuse determination made by the Santa Clara County Department of Social Services against Veronica Gonzalez, who whacked her daughter so hard with the cooking utensil she caused bruising.

'We cannot say that the use of a wooden spoon to administer a spanking necessarily exceeds the bounds of reasonable parental discipline,' Justice Conrad Rushing wrote for the unanimous three-judge panel.

Social workers wanted to report the South Bay mother to the state Department of Justice's child abuse database with a 'substantiated' abuse determination. That determination was upheld by a trial court judge.

However, while the appeals court said the spanking came close to abuse, it ruled that social workers and the lower court judge failed to consider the family's entire circumstances.

Gonzalez and her husband testified that other forms of punishment such as groundings and taking away her phone had failed to persuade their 12-year-old daughter to do her schoolwork. They said she as increasingly 'boy crazy' and had developed a growing interest in gangs.

The parents said other family members had testified that spankings in the household were a rarity but the implement was used in the April 2010 incident after the girl failed to come home until late at night.

The appeals court said the mother's growing frustration with her daughter's behavior and her intention not to inflict harm in the spanking weighed heavily in its ruling.

'Nothing in the record suggests the mother should have known she was inflicting bruises,' Rushing wrote.

Rushing continued that 'the spanking was entirely the product of a genuine and deliberate disciplinary purpose, i.e., to arrest troubling behavior patterns exhibited by the daughter.'

The court ordered the child abuse report to be withdrawn or Gonzalez given another hearing in which the San Jose family's entire circumstances are considered and the spanking put into context with the parents' growing frustration with a recalcitrant daughter.
