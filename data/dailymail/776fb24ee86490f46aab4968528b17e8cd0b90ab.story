A retired policeman who swapped his panda car for a beaten-up old tractor to travel 8,000 miles  to the northern tip of Norway has completed his epic journey.

Peter Matheson averaged just 10mph in his 1972 Massey Ferguson, and was hit by fourteen punctures as he braved mountain ranges and gale force winds along some of Europe's most spectacular roads. 

He is raising funds for the Tom Bowdidge Foundation - in memory of a 19-year-old who died of stomach cancer - and Unicef.

Way to go: Mr Matheson set off at the height of a balmy summer in August on a route which took in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland

Mr Matheson arrived back home in John O'Groats, Scotland on Saturday after six months on the tractor nicknamed Annie, with his Labrador Amber and a caravan in tow.

Although he started in the height of a balmy summer in August, Mr Matheson - who celebrated his 51st birthday on the epic trek - encountered some truly terrible weather in northern Europe between October and January, and, at some points, even feared for his life.

The father-of-one - who towed a caravan on the journey arrived back at John O'Groats, said: 'For me, the best part of it was easily the people.

'Until you do something like this, you don't know how many good people there are.

'It is bad news that makes the news and on this trip, I was all about the good news.'

Trusty: The vintage 1972 Massey Ferguson named Annie averaged just 10mph and suffered 14 punctures along the 8,000 mile journey

The trusty tractor, nicknamed Annie, is loaded on board a small ferry for a trip across the water in Bremervrde, Germany.

Bonkers? Mr Matheson said most of the people he encountered along the way asked if he was mad 

He added: 'The thing everyone asked me was 'are you completely bonkers? Even if they couldn't speak English, they could ask that.

'And my response always was 'I think everyone should do at least one mad thing in their life' and 'you only have one life, live it'.'

But he does admit he had to learn some things the hard way.

'On one occasion, not far into the journey, I was hit by a massive storm and I was going along the road and a lorry was coming the other direction and I thought to myself 'he's not for slowing down' and sure enough, it threw water up in the air and completely drenched me and I got a mouthful of dirty water.

'That's what I call learning the hard way.'

One another occasion, he was driving through a Norwegian mountain range during gale force winds and had to cross a bridge, which had a sheer drop on both sides.

Mr Matheson, who now lives in Scotland, added: 'It was a horrible, horrible day.

'When I got there, there just wasn't room to turn and this bridge was straight up and straight down, so I put the tractor in gear, gritted my teeth and just went for it and thought 'well, if it's my time, it's just my time'.'

He added: 'Aside from that, -20°C weather was a real low point.

'But for every low point, there were so many high points, like the Northern Lights - which I think everyone has to see - and they all involve some great people.'

The retired policeman pointed to the brakes on his tractor failing just before he met a man who made snow ploughs, who offered to fix the problem, as well as realising early one morning he had parked up in pitch black darkness during the previous night, after suffering some problems, outside a tractor repair centre.

8,000 miles

14 punctures

10mph average speed

15mph top speed 

£20,000 of his own money to complete the journey

£7,000 to buy the vintage 1972 Massey Ferguson tractor on eBay

£16,000: Total spend with travel costs, fuel and insurance 

Tom, from West Bergholt, died aged 19 in October 2013 from an aggressive stomach cancer.

Before he died, he raised more than £100,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust and his parents have set up a foundation in his name.

In total, the self-confessed 'mad man' has raised about £3,000, for the charities but wants to raise much more.

Mr Matheson's route took in John O'Groats, Colchester, Lands End, Dover and Calais before he drove to Nordkapp in Norway.

He returned via Finland, through Denmark, Calais, Dover and Lands End, before arriving back at John O'Groats.

But he is not content to get back to 'normal life'.

He is already planning to write a book about his journey before auctioning off some of his mementos.

This year, he also plans to take Annie the tractor to Ireland.
