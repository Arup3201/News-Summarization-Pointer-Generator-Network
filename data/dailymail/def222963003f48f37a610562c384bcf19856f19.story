Australia is the 18th happiest country in the world, according to a global survey.

The nation scored a 79 out of 100 on Gallup's Positive Experience Index, which involved about 1000 people aged 15 years and over from 138 countries.

It lagged behind the list's top five - Paraguay, Panama, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Ecuador.

Australia came just behind New Zealand, ranked 17th, in the happiness stakes in a global Gallup survey

But Australia's level of positivity was higher than most of the world. The global happiness score was 71.

This meant at least seven in 10 people across the globe were experiencing lots of enjoyment, laughing or smiling a lot, feeling well-rested, and being treated with respect.

Our neighbour across the ditch, New Zealand, was ranked just one spot higher in 17th place.

The report also found more than 51 per cent of people had learned or did something interesting the day before.

For a third year in a row, Paraguay topped the happiness stakes - this year with a score of 87.

Out of the top 10 countries, nine were South American.

Paraguay topped the list for the third year in a row and was one of the nine South American countries who made the top 10

The report credited the culture of the countries as a major contributor to their joy.

'That so many people are reporting positive emotions in Latin America at least partly reflects the cultural tendency in the region to focus on the positives in life,' it said.

Unsurprisingly emotional highs are at a low point in Syria, with the country falling to the bottom of the list for the second year in a row.

It scored 36 out of 100 on the happiness scale - an all-time low for any nation Gallup has measured.

'Fewer than one in three Syrians report feeling well-rested (31%), feeling enjoyment (31%), or learning or doing something interesting (25%) the day before,' the report said.

The Gallup report also found people with more money were happier.

In 2013, when the survey was done, there was a 10 percentage point gap between the highest and lowest income brackets.

But previous US research showed higher incomes only up to $75,000 had a positive impact on happiness.

Past that point, it made much less of a difference.
