Lovechild? Georgina Ray has claimed to be the daughter of Sir Jimmy Savile and has said she will take a DNA test to prove it

A woman who claims to be the secret love child of Sir Jimmy Savile is using a DNA test to lay claim to his millions.

Georgina Ray, 40, says her mother had a brief fling with the TV star while working as a waitress in the 1970s.

In December blonde Mrs Ray, who bears a striking resemblance to the late presenter, is understood to have told lawyers that she was ‘not after any money’.

But now she is waiting for the results of a DNA test which she believes will prove she is related to Sir Jimmy, who died last October aged 84.

If the results do conclude that she is his daughter, she could be entitled to his fortune, even though she has never met him and he specified most of his money went to charity. 

Sir Jimmy Savile’s niece and next of kin Amanda McKenna, 50, said the family are awaiting the outcome of  ­Mrs Ray's claim.

She told the Sunday Mirror: 'We have been told she has put in a claim on my Uncle Jimmy’s estate and everything is on hold until it’s ­resolved. It’s in the hands of the executors of the estate and they are dealing with it.'

She is reported to have facilitated a DNA test by using a strand of Sir Jimmy's famous white hair found in his flat.

At the time of his death, Sir Jimmy 
was worth £7.8million - his fortune was made up of £4.3million in his bank 
account, a £2.5million property portfolio and £1million in assets.

Apart from £600,000 which was placed in a
Trust fund to be shared between six of his closest friends and family, 
­including Ms McKenna.

He also set aside £1,000 each for 18 other friends. 

But he requested that the vast majority of the cash was donated to his charity the Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust.

His other charity, the Jimmy Savile Stoke Mandeville ­Hospital Trust, had £1.6million to its name.

Father: Georgina Ray says she was born after Sir Jimmy had a two-week fling with her mother, a cafe waitress, in 1970

Those benefiting from his will are understood to have ­received a letter ­saying a claim had been made.

It was put forward under the Inheritance ­(Provision for Family and Dependents) Act 1975 which means any child has a right to make a claim on their ­parent’s estate.

The funds in the  two charities’ bank accounts are currently the only money which is protected from her claim.

Mrs Ray has not outlined how much she is contesting and if she was proved to be his daughter she would need to prove to a court that whatever amount she wanted was ­'reasonable maintenance.'

This means it would be enough to cover her outgoings minus any salary she earns.

representative Mrs Ray was born after her mother had a two-week fling 
with the DJ, a well-known womaniser who died in October aged 84.

Visit: Friends also say that Mrs Ray travelled to Leeds to see Sir Jimmy¿s coffin, which was put on display in a hotel for three days after his death in October

At
the time of the affair, her mother Christine Oakes was 19 and working 
as a waitress in a greasy spoon cafe off the A5 in Cannock, 
Staffordshire.

She is said 
to have been ‘awestruck’ when the Top Of The Pops host walked in to the 
cafe, ordering six eggs sunny side up and two mugs of tea.

Sir Jimmy is said to have later ‘carried Christine out of the cafe caveman-style’ and taken her to his camper van.

Their
affair was over in only two weeks. But nine months later, Christine – 
who now uses her married name Rumford – gave birth to Georgina.

Christine, now 59, is said to have 
told her daughter when she was seven years old that Sir Jimmy was her 
father but forbade her from contacting him.

Mrs Ray is understood to have obeyed 
her mother’s request until two years ago, when following a difficult 
divorce from her husband Ian she decided to write a letter to the TV 
star revealing that she was his daughter.

After receiving no response she is said to have travelled to his luxury flat in Leeds to confront him.

But the ageing DJ is said to have spoken to her over the intercom pretending to be someone else, saying: ‘He’s away.’ He then refused to come to the door.

They say she nearly blurted out that she was his daughter there and then, but decided not to say anything.

A friend claimed that when Georgina was at school other children there learned who her father was and would tease her by repeating his catchphrases such as ‘Now then, now then’.

Mrs Ray is not the first person to claim a secret connection with Sir Jimmy. After his death, 61-year old divorcee Sue Hymns said they had been secret lovers for 43 years – and that their on-off relationship lasted from 1968 until his death.

Miss Hymns, a former PA, claims he told her that marriage and children ‘would never work’ because of his hectic showbusiness lifestyle. She has also said that his first words to her were: ‘Now then, now then.’
