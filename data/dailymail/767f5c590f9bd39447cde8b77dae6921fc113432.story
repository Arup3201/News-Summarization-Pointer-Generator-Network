Newt Gingrich has made a name for himself on the presidential campaign trail as a tough candidate who won’t let much phase him.

But the former House Speaker choked up and wiped away tears while recalling his late mother's struggle with depression and bipolar disease.

He told mothers in Des Moines, Iowa, his focus on brain science issues stems from ‘dealing with the real problems of real people in my family’.

Sadness: Newt Gingrich choked up and wiped away tears while recalling 
his late mother's struggle with depression and mental illness

After showing his emotions, the Republican presidential candidate conceded that he does ‘policy much easier than I do personal’.

Later in the day he showed his sensitive side again as he complained that politics was a 'vicious, negative business' and said his primary opponents were 'determined to lie'.

While addressing the attack ads on him which are believed to have pushed him down the polls, Mr Gingrich insisted: 'I am committed to running a positive campaign and we have to find a way to communicate.'

He told ABC News: 'I just think politics has become a really nasty, vicious, negative business and I think it’s disgusting and I think it’s dishonest.

'And I think the people who are running the ads know they are dishonest and I think a person who will do that to try to get to be President offers you no hope that they will be any good as President.'

He added: 'If you are determined to be positive, and you want to beat guys who are determined to lie, how do you do it?'

At the mothers' meeting, Mr Gingrich admitted: ‘I get teary-eyed every time we sing 
Christmas carols. My mother sang in the 
choir and loved singing in the choir.

‘When I was very young she made me sing in the choir and we had pictures of me at a very young age singing in the choir.’

The moment was reminiscent of Hillary 
Rodham Clinton's tearful response to a question just before the 2008 
Democratic primary in New Hampshire.

That was credited with humanising Mrs
Clinton in the eyes of voters, but she eventually lost out to President
Barack Obama as the race went on.

Mr Gingrich also talked about his work 
with former Nebraska senator Bob Kerrey on brain science and long-term 
care for the elderly.

He has fallen in recent Iowa 
polls behind frontrunners Mitt Romney and Ron Paul, with the caucuses just four days away.

An NBC poll put Mr Romney on 23 per cent, above Mr Paul on 21 per cent, Rick Santorum on 15 per cent and Rick Perry on 14 per cent.

Mr Gingrich is behind all four of them with 13 per cent, but is still above Michele Bachmann on 6 per cent and Jon Huntsman with 2 per cent.

At a Thanksgiving forum last month hosted by Mr Luntz, Mr Gingrich also cried - along with Rick Perry, Rick Santorum and Herman Cain.

That was when he talked about a friend's son born with a rare heart condition, reported The Atlantic.

Republican strategist Frank Luntz 
asked him at the event in Java Joe’s Coffee House about a moment with his mother 
that had changed his life.

'She
had bipolar disease and depression and she gradually acquired some 
physical ailments,' Mr Gingrich said to an audience of around 100.

'That introduced me to the whole issue of quality long-term care - and that introduced me to the issue of Alzheimer's.'

Mr Gingrich's mother Kathleen ‘Kit’ Gingrich died in 2003 aged 77.

'She spent 27 years as an Army wife,' Mr Gingrich said. 'I would say to her - I will do everything I can as a candidate to be worthy.'

Mr Gingrich's wife Callista, daughters Kathy and Jackie, sons-in-law, and two grandchildren joined him at the event, reported CNN.
