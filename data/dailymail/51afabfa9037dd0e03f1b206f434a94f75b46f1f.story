Let's hope there were no armed robbers watching this bank too closely today.

Security guard Du Jinqian took advantage of heavy snow in Hangzhou, eastern China, to show off his sculpting skills.

He took a break from his duties to build rows and rows of snow birds and a snow duck along the steps of the bank.

The security guard appears to have used bits of fruit to give the birds eyes and beaks

His creations had what appeared to be bits of fruit to create eyes, beaks and pink colouring for their breasts.

Passers-by crowded round to watch Du Jinqian and his remarkable hidden talent.

Almost two feet of snow has caused 
disruptions in China, closing Nanjing Lukou International Airport for 
more than 12 hours overnight and traffic on the roads.

Ninety houses collapsed and 114 
others were damaged costing the economy millions of pounds, according to
the CRI English website.
