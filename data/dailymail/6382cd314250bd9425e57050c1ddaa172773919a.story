New Scotland Yard, the famous headquarters of the Metropolitan Police, is set to be sold off in a radical £500 million cost-cutting plan, it was announced today.

The force is planning to move its HQ - one of London’s best-known landmarks - to a new smaller site on the Embankment.

The plan is part of a drive to axe dozens of police stations and buildings across London and save the force millions of pounds a year.

Landmark: The sale of the 1960s building could raise as much as £150million for the cash-strapped Met

Estate agents say the sale of the building - a 1960s office block in the heart of London - could raise £150 million for the cash strapped force.

The block, surrounded by concrete blast barriers to protect it from terrorist attack, has been home to the Met since 1967 and is famous for its revolving sign.

Senior officers say if the move goes ahead the sign will be brought to the new building.

The Met is planning to move the HQ to the Curtis Green building on the Embankment,  the former HQ of Territorial Policing and once the site of Canon Row police station.

The site is located just yards from the Ministry of Defence and Downing Street and was due to be sold until just months ago.

A property company had agreed to pay £30 million for the site but the Met pulled out at the last minute.

Insiders say the deal was called off because of security concerns around its proximity to Downing Street and Whitehall.

Police say the present 20-storey building in Victoria costs £11m a year to run and needs £50 million in maintenance in the next few years.

The force’s senior command is based in the building as are a number of the Yard's most secretive and elite squads, including the Counter Terrorist Command.

However, under the new plans the HQ will be drastically stripped down and operational squads will be moved out.

The new building can house just 600 or so people compared to the 3,000 or so who currently work in New Scotland Yard.

The Metropolitan Police Authority, the Met’s former controlling body, bought the freehold for the 1960s building in 2008.

Deputy Commissioner Craig Mackey said the headquarters in the heart of the capital was an 'expensive luxury', and that it would cost £50million to bring the 1967 building up to scratch.

He told the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime that the force hopes to save around £6.5million per year by moving to a smaller HQ.

'It's an expensive building to run and it's an expensive building to maintain and as we go through this change programme it's going to have space in it that we don't need.

'In central London that's an expensive luxury,' he said.

The force paid £124.5 million for the building in 2008 and it costs £11 million per year to run.

It is expected that the move will take around two years once approvals are in place.

Senior officers have drawn up plans to meet Government spending cuts of £500 million in the Met’s annual £3.6 billion budget by the year 2015.

John Tully, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, likened the sale of New Scotland Yard to losing the Crown Jewels.

'It's very regrettable that it's come to this,' he said.

'Clearly it's a building of age and it's got upkeep costs, but the old police authority and now Mopac have had a consistent policy of selling off property and they've now reached the Crown Jewels.

'An iconic building like New Scotland Yard is going to bite the dust.

'The Mayor needs to look at his own office. He sits in a brand new building on the South Bank - why doesn't he sell that to save money? Thousands of people work at New Scotland Yard and it seems to me that there will be a lot of incremental costs to relocate people.'

He said there had already been significant investment to refurbish the building, and the sale would be another knock to officers' morale.

While Met bosses have stressed that, despite the cuts, there will be more constables in the capital than ever - 25,000 - Mr Tully said numbers of more senior ranks will be reduced.He said: 'The Mayor has pledged to maintain numbers at about 32,000 but you balance that against cuts, for example 20 per cent budget cuts, then something has got to give and it's going to be sergeants and above, right to the top.

'We have grave concerns around the supervisory ranks that we represent - sergeant, inspector and chief inspector.

'The people who are left are going to be severely challenged, because, to be frank, some of them can't do all of their job now. There are only so many hours in the day.

'The people who we represent have been working their socks off, especially during the last 18 months, and then they have been told that they've got to do more and better and smarter. It's a bit of a kick in the teeth,' Mr Tully said.

Headquarters: The office block in Westminster currently houses some 3,000 staff

Police also plan to close and sell 
off dozens of London police stations - many of them older Victorian 
buildings - in an effort to save £60 million a year in running costs.

Recent stations approved for sale include South Norwood, Richmond, Highbury Vale, Walthamstow and Willesden Green.

However senior officers are pledging to open three new 'access points' or front counters for every station they shut.

These could be desks in community centres or supermarkets which would be open to the public at set times of the day.

The Met and the Mayor are committed to keeping at least one station per borough which is open round the clock.

The cost-cutting drive will also see a shake-up in the Met’s Safer Neighbourhood teams which could see smaller boroughs merged under joint management teams.

Some boroughs will share management and support functions and be run in clusters by a single commander.

Former HQ: The Metropolitan Police force used to be based in the Gothic Norman Shaw buildings on the Embankment

Police plan to cut the number of senior officers in the force - while increasing the number of constables by 1,000 to a total of 25,000.

They also want to move 2,000 officers from back room roles onto the streets.

Senior officers want to keep the Met’s total strength at around 32,000.Deputy Commissioner Craig Mackey said : 'We want to have a greater presence in London’s communities and re-locate our officers in popular locations.

'Our objective is to make sure that that under-used front counters are replaced by at least three new front counters if they are closed.

'We want to end up in places that are most accessible to Londoners,' he added.

Assistant Commissioner for territorial policing Simon Byrne said: 'There is a great variance across London in terms of the footfall in public counters.

'Our busiest gets around 100 visitors per day, our quietest on a good day gets two.

'Going forward with the financial pressures we face, it can't make economic sense to keep a building open on the off-chance that someone might pop in a couple of times per week.'

The cost of the counters varies from £70 per visit down to around £10 per visit, he said.

1829 - The Metropolitan Police force is created by Sir Robert Peel. The nickname 'bobbies' derives from his name. The first headquarters are named Scotland Yard after a street in London's Whitehall.

1842 - Scotland Yard forms a detective department and plainclothes detectives are sent out for the first time.

1884 - A bomb planted by the Fenians, an Irish republican movement, explodes at Scotland Yard. It leaves a hole in the wall and damages The Rising Sun, a neighbouring pub.

1887 - The Met headquarters expands into several neighbouring addresses, including several stables.

1888 - During the construction, workers discover a dismembered female torso. The case became known as the Whitehall Mystery and has never been solved.

1890 - New headquarters at the Norman Shaw Building on the Embankment are opened and called New Scotland Yard.

1967 - The headquarters are moved from the Norman Shaw Building to a new site in Victoria Street. They keep the name of New Scotland Yard.

1968 - The famous rotating sign, which performs more than 14,000 revolutions every day, is installed outside the main doors of the building.
