Danny Care and Billy Vunipola were dropped from the England squad on Tuesday night and Dylan Hartley will be demoted to the bench for Saturday’s Test against Samoa.

However, Owen Farrell has survived a selection cull but is likely to be switched from his favourite fly-half position to inside centre.

In response to defeats by New Zealand and South Africa which have extended the national team’s losing run to five games, head coach Stuart Lancaster has taken drastic steps to arrest the slide.

Hartley, who was sin-binned in the second half against the Springboks, will be replaced at hooker by Rob Webber, while Care and Vunipola have been ousted from the match-day 23, with Ben Youngs and Ben Morgan taking over at scrum-half and No 8 respectively.

When Lancaster names his line-up on Wednesday afternoon it will also include the recalled James Haskell at the expense of Tom Wood and Bath prodigy George Ford at No 10 for the first time, with, as expected, Farrell alongside him at inside centre.

Farrell has been out of form after coming into this QBE series short of game-time but he has been given a reprieve as the management seek to try out a 10-12 combination which was so effective at age-group level. 

The Saracens playmaker may be under pressure but his influence was lauded on Tuesday by England captain Chris Robshaw who said: ‘Owen’s a fantastic player. I’m a very firm believer that any team with him is much better than any team that doesn’t have him in.

‘He’s been fantastic. He helps lead the guys. He spoke extremely well before the game. He’s a great guy to have alongside you in the ranks. You need players like that around you in these tough environments, these tough games with the mentality that he’s not going to be fazed.

‘He’s been exactly the same this week. He’s continued to work hard and he has spoken well already. He wants to go out there and continue to improve as well. Owen is a key pivot.

‘To single out guys (for criticism) is extremely tough. It doesn’t come down to one person - it’s a team thing and as a team we stick together.’

Gloucester captain Billy Twelvetrees will be among the substitutes, along with Saracens scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth.
