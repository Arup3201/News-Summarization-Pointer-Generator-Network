A primary school may ban a Ghanaian teacher from visiting because parents fear he might spread Ebola - even though his country has had no recorded cases of the killer disease.

Christopher Baines, headteacher of Howden-le-Wear Primary School, has bowed to pressure and agreed it 'may be sensible' to scrap the event next Monday.

Parents are threatening to pull their children out of school  because they said they were not getting 'total reassurance' he will not bring Ebola with him. 

Row: Parents at Howden-le-Wear Primary School in County Durham, have raised concerns about a proposed visit from a Ghanaian teacher amid fears of spreading Ebola - despite there being no recorded cases in Ghana

Howden-le-Wear primary school, near Crook, County Durham, is partnered with the Great Commission Academy, a school in Ghana. 

In April teachers from the British school visited Ghana to meet students and other teachers, but now the return visit has proved unpopular with some parents.

This is despite Ebola cases only coming from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, which don't even share a border with Ghana.

One mother, who asked to remain anonymous, said: 'We have known about the trip for three or four weeks. We don't want to cause any hysteria, we just want to voice our concerns,' she said.

'This is not a witch hunt by any means, the children love the visits and the visitors are always so lovely.

'The letter we have got today addresses our concerns, but it doesn't say that there is absolutely no chance of Ebola coming over, and that's what we want - total reassurance.' 

In his letter to parents yesterday Mr Baines said flights to and from Ghana remain unaffected by the virus and the visiting teacher poses no risk.

But now it looks like he has changed his mind. 

He said: Having listened very carefully to concerns reiterated by some parents this morning and in the interests of preserving our excellent relationship with them and the wider local community, I will be liaising with our governing body and the British Council today and we will make a decision following these discussions regarding the planned visit next week.

'This was designed to be an enriching experience for both pupils here and our visitor from Ghana and it is important for everyone that it is a success and focuses solely on the outcomes of our Connecting Classrooms project.

'While the expert advice we have been given remains that Ghana is not one of the countries identified as having the Ebola virus and to date no cases of the virus have been recorded there, it may be that the sensible decision is to postpone this visit.'

It said: 'A number of parents have expressed their concern about the possible spread of the Ebola infection into the UK through the forthcoming visit of Mr Prempah, a visiting teacher from Great Commission Academy.

'In school we take all concerns raised by parents and the school community with the utmost seriousness and pupil/staff health and safety is our absolute primary concern.

'The health and wellbeing of our pupils is the most important thing to us so we have gone to considerable lengths to make sure we have expert advice regarding next week's visit from a number of regional and national authorities, including Public Health England, The Health Protection Agency, Durham County Council and the British Council.

'Given these facts and, following consultation with members of the school governing body, at this present time the visit planned for next week will go ahead.

'However, the situation will be monitored closely over the coming days and should any changes to this position become apparent, then immediate action will be taken.'

Screening of airline passengers from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea has started at Heathrow and will be rolled out at Gatwick and Eurostar terminals.

But there are calls for it to be extended to Port of Dover.

The Tory MP for Dover, Charlie Elphicke, said that despite it being a 'complicated' disease to detect, the port should be included in the UK's screening process.

A Department of Health said, however, there was no immediate plans to screen for Ebola at Britain's main passenge port.

Mr Elphicke said: 'I think if we are going to do checks at airports and on Eurostar it would make sense to do it in Dover'.

There have also been cases in Spain, the United States and Germany, but only from people who travelled back from west Africa or treated them in hospital.

The Government has warned that Britain should expect up to ten cases of Ebola by Christmas.
