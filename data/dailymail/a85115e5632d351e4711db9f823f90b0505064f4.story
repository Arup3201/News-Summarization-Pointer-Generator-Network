The Hatfields and McCoys, America's most infamous feuding families, have had new life breathed into the bitter rivalry thanks to the discovery of one of their most legendary battle sites.

An archaeological dig has shed light on the New Year's Day Massacre of 1888 which culminated with  the last in a long list of deaths on both sides and brought bloodshed to an end. 

Artifacts have been unearthed where the home of patriarch Randall McCoy once stood, in the rural lands of Hardy, Kentucky on the 125th anniversary of the massacre.

Out for revenge: The feud between the Hatfield clan (pictured) and the McCoys raged from the end of the Civil War in 1865 for more than two decades

On New Year's Day, 1888, the Hatfield family torched McCoy's home, killing two of his children and seriously injuring his wife.

The McCoys quickly retaliated with the battle of Grapevine Creek in
which several Hatfields were captured or killed.

Tensions had bubbled between the two families since the end of the Civil War in the Tug River valley region, an area which separates Kentucky from West Virginia.

The head of the Hatfield family was a man called William Anderson who was known as 'Devil Anse'. The McCoy clan were led by Randall McCoy.

The first ever clash between the two sides can be traced to 1865. Devil Anse, who had fought for the Confederate Army joined a militia called the Logan WildCats on the return to the family homestead.

A brother of Randall McCoy, Asa, who fought for the Union was murdered on his return to Tug River - no one was ever pinned for the death but it was believed that the WildCats were behind it.

More than ten years later in the late 1870s, Devil Hatfield got into a land dispute with a cousin of Randall McCoy.  Although Devil was awarded the land, bad feeling festered between the families - which was heightened by the accusation from Randall McCoy that a Hatfield cousin had stolen one of his hogs.

From there, it was simply a matter of time before the simmering tensions spilled over into violence.

Events were further complicated in 1880 by an almost Shakespearean event - Randall 
McCoy’s daughter Roseanna fell in love with Devil Anse’s son Johnse Hatfield.

The couple's decision to marry appeared to be apprehensively supported by both sides - however soon after Roseanna fell pregnant, she realized that Johnse would never marry her.

She tried to returned to the McCoy family home but was refused by her father. She lived with an aunt, giving birth to a baby which died from measles aged eight months.

To add to Roseanna's anguish, Johnse Hatfield married her cousin Nancy McCoy several months later.

Soon after, Devil Anse Hatfield’s brother Ellison was stabbed 27 times and shot in the back by three of Randall McCoy’s sons at a party.

The fleeing McCoy brothers were caught by a Hatfield gang and brought back to West Virginia. They were told by Devil Hatfield that they would live only if Ellison did, who was clinging on to life. 

When Ellison died, the Hatfields tied the McCoy brothers to trees and shot them.

The violence reached a climax on January, 1, 1888 when the Hatfield family crossed the river to burn down Randall McCoy's home.

All the Hatfields involved were sentenced to life in prison that September - and when Devil Anse Hatfield made no attempt for revenge, the sad and bitter feud was brought to a close.

An archaeological dig was conducted this year 
by the team from National Geographic show Diggers. The treasures they
unearthed have been verified by Kim McBride, co-director of the Kentucky Archaeological Survey.

Hosts
George 'KG' Wyant and Tim 'Ringy' Saylor first pinpointed the exact 
location of the fight using metal detectors. A dig revealed a piece of charred wood embedded with a nail along with parts of a stove and bullet casings.

The area, situated on private land, has long been believed to be the site of the Hatfield-McCoy battle. West Virginia University Extension 
Professor Bill Richardson told National Geographic: 'This is amazing.

'These appear to be actual bullets fired at the Hatfields by the McCoys 
in defense of their home. Nothing like this has ever been found before.'

Diggers: Hatfields & McCoys airs on Tuesday, January 29, at 10pm (ET/PT).  The new National Geographic Channel series Diggers premieres on Tuesday, January 1, 2013, with back-to-back episodes at 10 and 10.30pm (ET/PT)
