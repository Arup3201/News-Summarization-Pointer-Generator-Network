Let the games begin! Hosts Brazil kick off the 2014 World Cup against Croatia in Sao Paulo

Managers:

Luiz Felipe Scolari (Brazil) Niko Kovac (Croatia)Team news: Neymar has recovered from a training ground knock that left an entire nation holding its breath and is likely to start on the left in Scolari's typical 4-2-3-1 formation with Hulk on the opposite side and Fred playing as a lone striker.

Scolari is set to keep faith with Chelsea playmaker Oscar in the No 10 playmaker position, although if his inconsistent form continues he could turn to his club teammate Willian.

Croatia will be without their most potent forward, Mario Mandzukic, who is suspended following his red card in the play-off game against Iceland in November.

That means that Eduardo is likely to lead their attack against the country of his birth - with the striker recently admitting he might sing both national anthems.

Key clash: Neymar v Vedran Corluka

In his prime Vedran Corluka was a decent centre-back but his mobility has taken a drastic turn for the worse in recent years, which makes the prospect of facing Neymar, one of the most skilful players all the planet, all the more daunting.

Good luck with that! Vedran Corluka (R) will be tasked with stopping World Cup poster boy Neymar (L)

One to watch: Mateo Kovacic (Croatia)

Dubbed ‘Little Mozart’ by the Italian press for the manner in which he has controlled games at times for Inter Milan this season, the 19-year-old was instrumental in Croatia’s impressive qualifying win over Serbia and could start as a No 10 against Brazil.

Head-to-head record: Played 2 Brazil Wins 1 Draws 1

Little Mozart: Mateo Kovacic (R) is likely to provide creative inspiration for Croatia in the No 10 playmaking role

Predicted line-up: Brazil v Croatia

• The host nation has never lost their opening World Cup game, with the 20 previous hosts winning 14 and drawing six of their openers.• Brazil’s one previous tournament as hosts saw them defeat fellow 2014 Group A members Mexico 4-0 in their opening game (1950).• Eight of the last 12 opening matches at World Cups have produced one goal or less.• Brazil are taking part in their 20th World Cup. They are the only team to have taken part in every single tournament - winning it a record five times.• A Selecao have won the most games (67) and scored the most goals (210) at the World Cup.

* Brazil have won eight of their last nine World Cup games in the group stages (1 draw). Their last defeat dates back to 23 June 1998 against Norway (1-2).• Croatia have only conceded 11 goals in 13 World Cup games (0.85/game). It’s the best ratio among the 32 teams taking part in 2014.• Croatia’s last nine World Cup games have produced six red cards.• Brazil won their one previous competitive meeting with Croatia 1-0 in the 2006 World Cup; Kaka scored the winner in Berlin that day.

Come in No 6? Brazil have won a record five World Cups - the last inspired by Ronaldo (C) in 2002
