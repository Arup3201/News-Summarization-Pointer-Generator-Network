What woman wouldn't want to get that red carpet feeling and be treated like royalty for the day - all you have to do is bring your own Prince Charming.

Well that may now be possible after a Gold Coast company has upped their luxury levels by launching a new Cinderella limousine.

The stretch limo, which is the first of it's kind in Australia, comes complete with a middle extended 2.4m high carriage section, a personal handsome chauffeur and best of all, it won't turn into a pumpkin after midnight.

Costing $350 per hour, the life of opulence doesn't come cheap, but owners, Russian-born couple Alena and Slava Kouzmenkov, say the 'amazing vehicle' is worth every penny. 

The couple, who have been living in Australia for the past 15 years started their business in Europe and brought LuxCars to Australia with the hope of upping the limousine game here. 

Alena told Daily Mail Australia that the unique idea for the Chrysler 300cc limousine was inspired by Queen Elizabeth’s famous English coach, the Britannica.

'We thought 'why don't we do something like that but without the horses?'', Alena said.

'It took us quite a long time to put it together and then it took us probably about two years to get the engineering done,'

'We  initially provided a luxury limousine service overseas, working in both Europe and Asia but we wanted to bring the same European service here to the beautiful sunshine land.' 

Alena said the inside of the carriage is 'lovely' and is decked out with a bar, disco lights, music and features gold pillows and curtains set up for a prince of princess.  

The lavish red velvet interiors are set off by a huge plasma TV and a set of champagne glasses which finish off the inside of the carriage, which Alena stresses is very private.

'You can't see the driver and the driver can't see you so it's very very private,' she said.  

The whole concept of the limousine is that the occupant  is supposed to imagine they are in a horse and carriage.

Different tour packages are available on the company website as long as you are seven-years-old or above. The limousine has a capacity to take six people and you can bring your own alcohol.

Wedding packages, beauty packages and even little princess packages are available for people looking for that extra bit of luxury. The company said they can customise any package for their clients.  

'It's ready to take booking. We've already taken a couple of bookings this morning,' Marketing Manager Stephen Kennedy said. 

'It's turning heads already, it's an amazing vehicle.'
