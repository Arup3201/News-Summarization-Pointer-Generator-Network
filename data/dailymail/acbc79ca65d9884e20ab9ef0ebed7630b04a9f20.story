Worms weren't always as spineless as you might think.

In fact, human spines may have evolved from an ancient marine worm, according to new research.

The study claims that the first vertebrate skeleton 'probably evolved from muscle', and its origins are older than first thought.

The marine worm Platynereis has a muscle (red) which develops in the same place and has the same genetic signature as the notochord (blue) that develops into our spinal discs

Humans are part of a group of animals called chordates, whose defining feature is a rod of cartilage that runs lengthwise under the spinal chord.

This structure, called the notochord, was the first vertebrate skeleton, according to scientists at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, Germany.

It is present in human embryos, and is replaced with the backbone as we develop, with the cartilage reduced to those tell-tale discs.

Since starfish, sea urchins and related animals have no such structure, scientists assumed the notochord had emerged in a relatively recent ancestor, after our branch of the evolutionary tree split away from the 'starfish branch'.

Scientists found that the larva of the marine worm Platynereis has a group of cells with that same genetic signature as the first ever vertebrate skeleton

Researchers at Cambridge University believe a 505 million-year-old creature, found only in the Burgess Shale fossil beds in Canada’s Yoho National Park, is the most primitive known vertebrate.

Named Pikaia gracilens, it is the most primitive member of the chordate family, the group of animals that today includes fish, amphibians, birds, reptiles and mammals. 

Pikaia was first described, on the basis of only a few specimens, by American palaeontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott in 1911.

Averaging about five centimetres in length, Pikaia was a sideways-flattened, somewhat eel-like animal. 

The flattened body is divided into a series of segmented muscle blocks seen as S-shaped lines that lie on either side of the notochord which runs along most, if not all of the body length.

 It likely swam above the sea floor by moving its body in a series of side-to-side curves.

'People simply haven't been looking beyond our direct relatives, but that means you could be fooled, if the structure appeared earlier and that single group lost it,' says Detlev Arendt from EMBL, who led the study.

'And in fact, when we looked at a broader range of animals, this is what we found.'

Antonella Lauri and Thibaut Brunet identified the genetic signature of the notochord - the combination of genes that have to be turned on for a healthy notochord to form.

When they found that the larva of the marine worm Platynereis has a group of cells with that same genetic signature, the scientists teamed up with EMBL to use microscopy to follow those cells as the larva developed.

They found that the cells form a muscle that runs along the animal's midline, precisely where the notochord would be if the worm were a chordate.

The researchers named this muscle the axochord, as it runs along the animal's axis.

Most of the animal groups that sit between Platynereis and chordates on the evolutionary tree also have a similar, muscle-based structure in the same position.

The scientists reason that such a structure probably first emerged in an ancient ancestor, before all these different animal groups branched out on their separate evolutionary paths.

Such a scenario would also explain why the lancelet amphioxus, a 'primitive' chordate, has a notochord with both cartilage and muscle.

Rather than having acquired the muscle independently, amphioxus could be a living record of the transition from muscle-based midline to cartilaginous notochord.

The shift from muscle to cartilage could have come about because a stiffened central rod would make swimming more efficient, the scientists claim.
