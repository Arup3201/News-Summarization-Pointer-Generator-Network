'White Widow' Samantha Lewthwaite married into the family of a notorious al-Qaeda commander just three years after her first husband took part in the London bombings, it has been claimed.

The 30-year-old mother-of-four, originally from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, is said to have married Kenyan Fahmi Jamal Salim shortly after meeting him in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2008.

Salim's brother-in-law was Musa Dheere - a senior figure in East Africa's al-Qaeda affiliated al-Shabaab group, who was shot dead at a roadblock in the in the Somali capital, Mogadishu in 2011.

Lewthwaite is now considered to be a senior figure in al-Shabaab herself, having fled Britain in the aftermath of the London 7/7 bombings, in which her first husband Germaine Lindsay and three other men killed 52 people in a series of coordinated suicide attacks on public transport during rush hour.

Forged: Both Lewthwaite and Salim are understood to have travelled to Kenya on fake South African passports - hers in the name Natalie Faye Webb - shortly after the death of al-Shabaab leader Fazul Mohammed in 2011

Muslim convert Lewthwaite's marriage to Salim brought her closer to his brother-in-law Musa Dheere, according to the Daily Telegraph.

The family were said to be slot close-knit that Lewthwaite apparently fled the property alongside Dheere when Kenyan police conducted a raid to break up his terror cell.

Dheere was later killed in June 2011 at a checkpoint in Mogadishu alongside Fazul Mohammed - the overall leader of al-Shabaab and therefore the most senior al-Qaeda figure in East Africa.

Lewthwaite is understood to have met Salim in Johannesburg in 2008 following an introduction by radical hate cleric Abdullah al-Faisal - who she is said to have visited while he was serving a four year sentence at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire.

According 
to a BBC Panorama documentary due to air on Wednesday, al-Faisal 
subsequently arranged the marriage between Lewthwaite and Salim because 
he 'knew her taste'.

Lewthwaite agreed to marry Salim because she wanted 'a young man of a different race, preferably the black race, who 
  was very handsome and very strong in the Muslim faith,' al-Faisel told the BBC.

Samantha Lewthwaite is the widow of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, who blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train between King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square stations.

She was the daughter of a former soldier before converting to Islam.

The British Muslim convert is linked to the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi in which 67 people were killed, and is thought to be hiding in Somalia.

Interpol issued a 'Red Notice' warrant for her arrest shortly after the attacks for terrorist offences in Mombasa dating back to 2011.

The 29-year-old is the world's most wanted woman after being accused of allegedly ordering the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, and three others with links to al-Shabaab.

They are reportedly living in forests and caves and getting milk from nomadic farmers in the region.

Both Lewthwaite and Salim are understood to have travelled to Kenya on fake South African passports shortly after the death of al-Shabaab leader Fazul Mohammed in 2011.

Lewthwaite's passport was in the name Natalie Faye Webb and Salim's is his believed to be in 
  the name Marc Costa. 

Lewthwaite, the widow of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, is currently believed to be among those planning revenge attacks following the death of al-Qaeda leader Abubakar Shariff Ahmed.

Ahmed was killed by unidentified gunmen in April as he and a friend were walking from a court inMombasa, Kenya to a nearby mosque.

Security services now fear she will attack Western-affiliated targets in Africa because she blames the Kenyan government for the death of Ahmed.

Ahmed, who had denied meeting Lewthwaite, was suspected of helping more than 100 Britons to join al-Shabaab, which carried out the Westgate Mall shootings in Kenya.

Since his death, Kenya has seen a rise in the number of attacks.

There have been a number of reports about Lewthwaite's relationship status over the last few years, with various sources suggesting she had wed a number of prominent Islamist militants.

Earlier this year it was claimed Lewthwaite has married al-Shabaab warlord Hassan Maalim Ibrahim - who is also known as Sheikh Hassan. 

#Last year a copy of Lewthwaite's manifesto transcribed into English by one her recruits revealed her plans to wage war on westerners.
