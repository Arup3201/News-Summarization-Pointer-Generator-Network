Atletico Madrid advanced to the last 16 of the Copa del Rey despite drawing 2-2 with third-tier L'Hospitalet on Thursday night.

Diego Simeone's side went into the tie as firm favourites after winning the first leg 3-0, but the visitors ensured their opponents were made to work for their place in the next round of the cup. 

Mario Mandzukic opened the scoring just 19 minutes into the first half after calmly slotting home when one-on-one with goalkeeper Carlos Craviotto.

The Segunda B side briefly made it 1-1 on the night when Ruben Alcaraz's long-range effort was deflected over Jan Oblak's head.

But Mandzukic added a second just six minutes later to restore the La Liga champions' lead.

There was still time for one more twist, though, as Alcaraz equalised for a second time with a brilliant, swerving long-range effort.

Remarkably, L'Hospitalet could have stolen a winner late on when substitute Syedou Keita almost directed a corner into his own net, but Slovenian keeper Oblak's quick reactions saved Simeone's blushes. 

Atletico will now face holders and rivals Real Madrid in the next round. 

Elsewhere, Elche advanced to the last 16 after beating 10-man Valladolid 1-0 in a scrappy affair at the Estadio Manuel Martinez Valero. 

Adrian scored the only goal of the tie in the seventh minute to give the hosts their first victory in any competition since the beginning of November and set up a tie with Catalan giants Barcelona.
