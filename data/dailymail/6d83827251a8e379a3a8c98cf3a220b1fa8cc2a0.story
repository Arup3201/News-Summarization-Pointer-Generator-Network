Want to emulate Millie Mackintosh's bohemian summer style? Now you can, because the Made In Chelsea star-turned-designer has just released even more designs from her hotly anticipated fashion range.

The 25-year-old has added to her spring/summer 15 range - and there's feminine lace dresses, cool khaki jackets and a peach jumpsuit perfect for the festival season.

Speaking to FEMAIL about her new collection of suede dresses and tasseled jackets, the stylish star said: 'The range was inspired by my love of festivals and it has a real 70s influence.

'It's full of easy-to-wear shapes, feminine patterns and playful prints.'

Posing on location in Marrakesh in the new campaign imagery to promote her designs, Millie shows her fans how to work the looks - and she maintains it's all about letting your inner hippie out.

'When it comes to summer dressing, you've just got to have fun with it. My clothes are really accessible and you can dress them up or down depending on the occasion.'

As well as style expertise, Millie, who trained as a make-up artist before finding fame, is a beauty buff with her own eyelash range.

Sharing her top beauty tips for flawless summer skin, the star - a self-confessed sun worshiper - says SPF is essential.

'I loved sunbathing all my life and now I am so worried about sun damage so I always wear a tinted moisturiser with an SPF in and some cream bronzer and pastel eyeshadow for a natural sunkissed look.'

As well as cramming in holidays, fashion design and fitness classes, Millie is preparing to release her debut book at the end of the month.
