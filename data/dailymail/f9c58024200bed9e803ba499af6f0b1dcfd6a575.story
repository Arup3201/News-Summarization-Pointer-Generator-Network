Daniel Morgan, 37, was found in a pub car park in Sydenham, south London, in 1987 with an axe embedded in his head

Theresa May could launch a judicial inquiry into the unsolved axe murder of a private investigator 25 years ago after claims that the News of the World ‘intimidated’ detectives overseeing the case.

Five inquiries failed to find Daniel Morgan’s murderer after he was killed in a Sydenham pub car park in 1987 amid claims he was preparing to expose police corruption.

He was found with an axe embedded in his head while his watch had been stolen but his wallet had been left with a large 
sum of money still in his jacket pocket.

For two decades the case has been surrounded by allegations that Mr Morgan planned to reveal a circle of corrupt police officers selling information to News of the World and other newspapers through a private detective agency run by Mr Morgan’s business partner Jonathan Rees.

Police Minister Nick Herbert yesterday admitted a judicial inquiry was under ‘consideration’ during a parliamentary debate yesterday.

The move follows claims made earlier this week during the Leveson inquiry that the tabloid newspaper collaborated with suspects - at the detective agency previously hired by News of the World - by placing a senior detective investigating the Morgan murder case under surveillance on the pretense that he was having an affair.

Mr Morgan’s family - who have always believed he was killed because he was 
about to expose a network of police corruption involving his business 
partner Jonathan Rees, his friend the ex-Met police detective Sid Fillery 
and a string of corrupt police officers - have been pushing for a judicial inquiry into the handling of investigations into the murder.

Daniel Morgan's brother Alistair Morgan and his sister Jane McCarthy have been campaigning for justice since his murder in 1987

And Labour MP Tom Watson yesterday 
accused the newspaper of trying to undermine previous murder investigations 
during an adjournment debate ahead of the 25th anniversary of Mr 
Morgan’s death in
Sydenham, south London, on March 10, 1987.

Mr Watson said News of the World 
crime journalist Alex Marunchak was a close associate of Mr Morgan's business partner Mr Rees - who became a main suspect in his murder - and 
regularly paid his company Southern Investigators for information.

Crimewatch presenter Jacqui Hames told the Leveson inquiry News of the World had put her and her then husband under surveillance to intimidate them

He
told fellow MPs: ‘Jonathan Rees and Sid Fillery were at the corrupt 
nexus of private investigators, police officers and journalists at the 
News of the World.

‘Southern
Investigations was the hub of police and media contacts involving the 
illegal theft and disclosure of information obtained through Rees and 
Fillery’s corrupt contacts.’

And when Detective Chief Inspector Dave Cook started to investigate the murder, at a time when Mr Rees was still a suspect, it is alleged Mr Marunchak placed the police officer under 
surveillance.

Mr Rees was accused of Mr Morgan's murder in 2008 but the case collapsed in 2010.

West Bromwich East MP
Mr Watson told the adjournment debate: ‘The person who was 
investigating a murder was put under close surveillance by a close 
business associate of the man he was investigating.

‘A journalist tried to undermine a murder investigation.’

This latest claim follows Detective
Cook's then wife Jacqui Hames telling the Leveson inquiry that the suspects in the 
Morgan murder had encouraged the tabloid to watch them to ‘intimidate 
them’.

Ms Hames said she believed the News of the World had put them under 
surveillance because ‘suspects in the Daniel Morgan murder inquiry were 
using their association with a powerful and well-resourced newspaper to 
intimidate us and try to attempt to subvert the investigation’. 

In response to a request by the Metropolitan police to explain the surveillance, the paper’s then editor, Rebekah Brooks, said it was investigating suspicions Ms Hames and Mr Cook were having an affair.

But Ms Hames told the inquiry into press standards that Mrs Brooks’s explanation was ‘absolutely pathetic’, given that it was common knowledge the couple had been married for several years and had two children.

She said in a statement to the inquiry: 'These events left me distressed, anxious and needing counselling, and contributed to the breakdown of my marriage to David in 2010.

'Given the impact of these events, I would like to know why the police did not investigate why we came to be placed under surveillance by a newspaper like this.

'I think any reasonable person would find it difficult not to put them together and feel that in some way there was some collusion between people at the News of the World and the people who were suspected of committing the murder of Daniel Morgan.'

And a judicial review could now be in the pipeline after the new revelations this week.

Speaking at a Westminster Hall 
adjournment debate yesterday, Mr Herbert said: ‘It is important to 
consider what options are now available to identify and address the 
issue of police corruption and to bring those responsible for Daniel’s 
murder to justice.

‘The Morgan family have called for a judicial inquiry and this call has been endorsed by the Metropolitan Police Authority.’

He added: ‘We are considering very carefully if this is the right way forward. The Home Secretary and I haven’t ruled out ordering a judicial inquiry at this stage.’

Labour MP Tom Watson, who spearheaded the 
campaign to expose the phone hacking scandal at the Sunday 
tabloid, yesterday claimed the NoW may have paid police officers’ relatives 
for information about the murders of Soham schoolgirls Holly Wells and 
Jessica Chapman.

He claims the newspaper's crime reporter Alex Marunchak bought details about the investigation into the 2002
killings and urged the Home Office to study
secret reports relating to the probe in Cambridgeshire.

Mr
Watson said: ‘I believe the Metropolitan Police are sitting on an 
intelligence report from late 2002 that claims a police contact 
overheard Marunchak claim he was paying the relatives of police officers
in Cambridgeshire for information about the Soham murders.

‘These are allegations that as far as we know have not been investigated.

‘I
don’t whether these intelligence reports are accurate, but I do know 
Alex Marunchak was involved in writing stories about how the Manchester 
United shirts of those young girls were found.’The
MP called on News International boss Rupert Murdoch to apologise for 
the conduct of staff at his paper during the investigations into the 
Soham killings

Mr Herbert said it was ‘a horrific murder, exacerbated by the failure to see those responsible held to account’.

He
revealed that the Morgan murder is now being overseen by the assistant 
commissioner Cressida Dick and the Met will be carrying out a full 
forensic review of the case – similar to the one undertaken in the 
Stephen Lawrence murder which led to the successful conviction of two 
men earlier this year.

Mr Watson, who spearheaded the campaign to expose the phone hacking scandal at the now-defunct Sunday tabloid, made other allegations about the News of the World yesterday.

He also claimed during the debate that the newspaper may have paid police officers’ relatives for information about the murders of Soham schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman.

He cited claims Mr Marunchak bought details about the investigation into the 2002 killings which shocked the country - and urged the Home Office to study secret reports relating to the probe in Cambridgeshire.

Mr Watson said: ‘I believe the Metropolitan Police are sitting on an intelligence report from late 2002 that claims a police contact overheard Marunchak claim he was paying the relatives of police officers in Cambridgeshire for information about the Soham murders.

‘These are allegations that as far as we know have not been investigated.

‘I don’t whether these intelligence reports are accurate, but I do know Alex Marunchak was involved in writing stories about how the Manchester United shirts of those young girls were found.’

Mr Watson also claimed to MPs details on one of the girls’ parents were found in files belonging to convicted phone hacker Glenn Mulcaire, who was previously jailed for illegally listening to voicemails.

The MP called on News International boss Rupert Murdoch to apologise for the conduct of staff at his paper during the investigations into the Soham killings and Mr Morgan’s murder, as the media tycoon previously apologised to murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler’s family.

The revelation Milly’s phone was hacked by NoW journalists forced the paper’s closure last summer.

Mr Watson said today: ‘I think Rupert Murdoch owes the Morgan family an apology. I also don’t think he has made his last apology to the grieving parents of dead children.’

Mr Marunchak has previously denied having any contact with Daniel Morgan and all allegations of wrongdoing.

News International had no comment.
