Guests at a 40th birthday party were stunned when the knees-up turned into a surprise Highland wedding.

About 80 friends and members of family at Claire Scott's bash couldn't believe it when her partner David Alldritt dropped to one knee and popped the question.

Claire then disappeared and returned in her wedding dress as David's dumbfounded daughters were asked to be bridesmaids and another guest, who is a registrar, married the couple.

David Alldritt proposed to Claire Scott in front of shocked guests  on their surprise wedding night in the Highland village of Boat of Garten

Even the bride-to-be's mother and father - who made a 720-mile round trip from England - were clueless about the plan.

Paramedic Claire said: 'Everyone was completely delighted and surprised - the atmosphere was really unbelievable.

'When Dave proposed everybody gasped- you could hear the air being taken out of the room, they were really shocked.

The pair, who live in Kingussie, had been planning to hold the ceremony at her party for the last two months, revealing the secret to a select few on a 'need to know basis'.

The two, here cutting their wedding cake, invited guests to Claire's birthday party and didn't reveal to anyone their plan to marry

David, 53, a telecoms company director, said: 'We didn't tell anybody we didn't have to tell.

'Planning it secretly made it more fun, but it wasn't without its moments of difficulty when people were asking questions about things like dress code and we had to be very careful with the answers.

'We had to tell the hotel staff and they were really cooperative. They were absolutely brilliant and managed to keep the lid on it for us, despite the fact some of the people attending the party were staying there.'

The guests arrived at the Nethy Bridge Hotel in Boat of Garten and ate their meal, believing it was just a 40th birthday party for Claire.

But as soon as they had finished eating, David got down on one knee and proposed - and shocked guests were told that the wedding would be that night.

The bride-to-be then went to change into her wedding dress, while David's daughters, Charlotte, 29, Lucy, 25, and Emily, 21, were asked to be bridesmaids.

One of their guests, Keith Taylor, of Loch Morlich Watersports, is an accredited local registrar so he did the honours.

David said: 'Everybody loved it. They all thought it was well overdue, as we met in 2000, and splendidly done.

'Keeping it secret really added something to the atmosphere.'

Claire said that they wanted a 'no-fuss' wedding: 'We realised we should get married but thought that we could do without any of the fuss.

'We planned it a couple of months in advance- we've both been married before so we didn't want anything too stuffy or traditional.

The couple, who have been together since 200, said the surprise, low key event was perfect for them

'I guess since we've been together for such a long time that they never expected to see us actually get married.'

But there was no time for a honeymoon after the wedding on Saturday 22nd March, as Claire had to head back to work on Monday morning.

The lack of wedding presents also didn't faze her: 'It wasn't about presents, we were just glad for the chance to celebrate and make (our relationship) official.'

Mother of the bride Janice Scott, 68, who travelled up from Cheshire with husband Des, said: 'We always assumed that they, like a lot of couples these days, would just never get married.

'It certainly came as a pleasant surprise when David got down on one knee and proposed.

'I still wasn't very surprised until Claire said that the wedding would be that night!'

She praised her husband's impromptu speech, saying: 'He actually gave quite a good speech in the end. He was quite nervous but said that it went better than if he had rehearsed it.

'It was a really lovely night and when Claire changed into her wedding dress she looked really beautiful.'

Guests were delighted in the sudden change in plans for their evening,  enjoying a spot of dancing after the ceremony

Father Des, 71, said he had about five minutes to write his speech: 'The best man came up to me and said that it was usual in weddings for guests to make a speech on a wedding.

'I just thought 'in for a penny, in for a pound', spent about five minutes writing it and just gave it my all.

'The funny thing is that I can't remember a word of it now, but Dave and my daughter came up afterwards and thanked me so it must have been alright.

'It was certainly a shock but we were really happy for them... the best part was that I didn't have to pay.'

Guest David Craig said everyone was amazed that the couple had managed to keep the wedding a secret.

He said: 'The joy and excitement of the happy couple was shared by all friends and family, who were truly privileged to be part of Claire and Dave's very special fairytale wedding.'
