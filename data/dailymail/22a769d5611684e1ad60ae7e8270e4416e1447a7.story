Championship side Cardiff City have revealed their new badge to be worn on players' kits from the 2015/2016 season with an announcement on Twitter.  

Owner Vincent Tan had already approved to change the club's home shirts back from red to blue in January, following a prolonged dispute with supporters; and now, the 63-year-old has agreed to give Cardiff's Bluebird mascot a prominent position in the re-designed crest. 

The new design also features a small dragon at the bottom of the badge similar to the one found at Cardiff City Hall.

A club statement read: 'Projecting our Welsh heritage, the stance was taken from the national flag, as has been seen on our crest or shirt for a number of years.

'Celebrating Asian linked culture, design and tradition influences, we also looked to create a dragon that could be primarily owned and appreciated locally.

'To achieve this the main influence was drawn from the dragon placed on top of Cardiff City Hall, as has been the case since 1904'.

Cardiff's controversial switch to red shirts was introduced in June 2012 after Tan bought the club. He believed that the new colour would improve Cardiff's 'appeal in international markets.' 

The Welsh side were promoted to the Premier League in April 2013, but lasted just one season and fell to relegation in May the following year. 

Now, back in the Championship, Cardiff are 15th in the table with 44 points from 36 games.

Sian Branson, spokesperson for the Bluebirds Unite group, an organisation that campaigned against the red re-branding, was pleased that the decision had been reversed. 

'At least I know I'm supporting CCFC when I look at this badge,' she told the BBC.

'The future's blue and we don't have to feel as detached from our club anymore'
