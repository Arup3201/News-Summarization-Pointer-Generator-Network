A thief who broke into two cars in the middle of the night told a court he did it because he was trying to cure his insomnia.

David Pinnock stole a mobile phone, sunglasses, CDs and a hat, from the cars in South Shields, while out riding his bike on February 6.

The 30-year-old was arrested shortly after the break-ins, and pleaded guilty to two counts of theft from a motor vehicle at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court.

His solicitor told the court that Pinnock, of South Shields, has trouble sleeping, and was trying to tire himself out when he committed the crimes.

Stan Sudworth, prosecuting, said the cars were both parked in the West Park area of the town and had their windows broken with a screwdriver.

Kayleigh Helens, defending, said: 'The defendant has great trouble sleeping. He goes out at night time on his bike, to wear himself out. He had no intention of stealing anything.

'He had a screwdriver on him, but that was in case he needed to fix the bike. It was stupidity.'

Magistrates adjourned the case until March 14 for the probation service to prepare a report about Pinnock.

He was granted bail on the condition that he lives at the address given to the court and stays indoors between 7pm and 7am at night.
