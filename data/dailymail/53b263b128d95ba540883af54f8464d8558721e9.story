A woman stole a dead mother’s identity to trick her way into Britain - and then defrauded taxpayers out of more than £100,000.

Illegal immigrant Catherine Kyie, 33, was jailed for impersonating a mother who died after childbirth to get from Ghana into the UK.

A court heard mother-of-three Kyie then claimed family tax credits, child benefit payments and was paid by the NHS over eight years.

Jailed: Catherine Kyie, 33 (right) impersonated a mother who died after childbirth to get from Ghana into the UK which allowed fellow Ghanian Kenneth Boateng, 45, (left) to enter the country pretending to be her husband

Kyie pretended to be tragic Joyce Pokuaa - another Ghanaian woman who had married a Dutch man and started their own family.

Prosecutor Roger Griffiths said: 'But she died three months after giving birth to her son in 2003.'But it meant she would have been free to travel through Europe because of her marriage. Kyie stole her identity and took on her name.'

Kyie then allowed fellow Ghanian Kenneth Boateng, 45, to pretend to be her husband so he could illegally get into Britain in 2005.

The couple and their three children lived in Britain claiming state benefits and child tax credits.

But Cardiff Crown Court heard they were finally rumbled when relatives of the dead mother’s 10-year-old son wanted him to come to the country.

Mr Griffiths said: 'He was unable to travel because it was discovered his passport had been renewed in 2009 by Boateng and a woman claiming to be his mother - although she had been dead for five or six years.

'That passport was eventually found at their home.

'Police also discovered a Dutch identity card and a passport in the name of Joyce Pokuaa but showing Kyie’s photograph.'

Smirking: Kyie was imprisoned for 15 months and Boateng (pictured) for 12 months. Both will be automatically deported after serving their sentences

The court heard two of the couple’s three children, aged five, seven and 10, were born in the UK.

The ID fraud family lived illegally in Newport, South Wales, for eight years before they were caught.

Kyie worked illegally as a cleaner in NHS hospitals and universities, while Boateng worked as a driver and late night security guard.

Claire Pickthall, defending Kyie, said: 'It is a serious offence and she accepts her motivation was gain.

'But the gain was only to come to the UK to have a better life for herself and her family - nothing more sinister than that.

'She has worked hard all the time she has been here.

'The mother of three was arrested along with Boateng who at first claimed he had been duped and thought his wife’s name was Joyce.

But the couple eventually pleaded guilty to 14 charges of fraud by misrepresentation to enter and remain in the UK illegally.

Judge Patrick Murphy told Kyie she was the 'prime mover' in the fraud.

He said: 'You obtained benefits through employment and tax benefits to the cost of £104,562.

'The commission of all your offences is based on the identity theft of Joyce Pokuaa by you.'

Judge Murphy said Kyie began stealing the dead mother’s identity documents in 2004 - just months after she gave birth to a son and died in Ghana following childbirth complications.

He told the pair it was now their children who had become the innocent victims. Judge Murphy told them: 'You took the chance - they will pay the price.

'Possession and use of false identity documnets are serious offences and go to the heart of undermining the immigration processes of this country.

'They deprive others of legal entry to the country and employment and allow false benefits to be maintained at cost to the legitimate British tax payer.'

Kyie was imprisoned for 15 months and Boateng for 12 months.

Both were told they would be automatically deported after serving their sentences
