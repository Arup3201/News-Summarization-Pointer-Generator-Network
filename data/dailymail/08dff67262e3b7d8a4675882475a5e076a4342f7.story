The family of murdered honeymoon bride Anni Dewani spoke of their anguish last night after her husband  was given more time to fight extradition over her death.

Millionaire businessman Shrien Dewani is to seek a last-ditch appeal at the Supreme Court – the highest court in England, Wales and Northern Ireland – despite the High Court and the Home Secretary Home Secretary   Theresa May declaring he should be flown to South Africa to face trial over his wife’s murder.

Anni’s father Vinod Hindocha said: ‘When the High Court decided  last month that he should go back, I believed that was it and he was on  his way.

‘The judges said it was not only in the interests of justice that he should go back, but also in the interests of us, Anni’s family.

‘But now we find he is looking for another way out of facing trial and they may reverse their decisions.

‘I am so upset by this news. It has been more than three years and the British courts still allow him to carry on looking for a way out of talking to the police.’

Dewani, 33, is being detained under the Mental Health Act and suffers post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Doctors say he may be unfit to stand trial, although it is accepted he can travel. But various hearings have been told that he has been able to visit his family home, swim, use the computer and stay in a caravan on hospital grounds.

Mr Hindocha said he had no reason to doubt that Dewani, from Bristol, had suffered post-traumatic stress disorder and needed treatment.

But he added: ‘The South Africans have convinced the British judges that their medical facilities and doctors will care for him adequately over there. It has also been agreed that he is recovering and is well enough to get on a plane and meet detectives in Cape Town.’

Anni’s mother Nilam, who is battling cancer, added: ‘It has been more than three years since our dear daughter was killed and we are desperate for Shrien to tell the police what happened.

‘Unless Shrien is back in South Africa and in front of a judge there, we cannot rest.’

Anni, 28, was shot through the neck in the back of a taxi which Dewani says was carjacked by robbers in the Gugulethu township near Cape Town in November 2010.

He told South African police that he was pushed out of the back window of the car and their attackers kidnapped his wife before shooting her.

There was no robbery or sexual assault, police said.

Three men – the driver of the taxi and two gunmen – have been jailed for the murder in Cape Town.Dewani is accused of paying hitmen the equivalent of £1,500 for the killing.

But he has described any claim that he was involved in setting up his wife’s murder as ‘absurd’. He will argue that his extradition is wrong and that he should continue his treatment in Britain.

The Judicial Office, which reports to the  Lord Chief Justice, has confirmed that Dewani’s lawyers  have made an application for the case to go before  the Supreme  Court.
