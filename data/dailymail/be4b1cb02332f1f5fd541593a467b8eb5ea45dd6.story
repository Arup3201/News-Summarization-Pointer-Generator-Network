A new exercise book called The Pregnant Athlete shows women in their second and third trimester flipping truck tires, swinging large hammers and leaping over barbells.

Written by CrossFit instructor Brandi Dion, and her exercise scientist husband Steven Dion, the book is no way intended for exercise novices - but is it taking the idea of working out during pregnancy too far?

'We were just documenting what I did during my two pregnancies,' Mrs Dion told ABC.  'We wanted to show women who are already in great shape that they can maintain a high level of fitness during pregnancy.'

In recent years, a growing number of women have chosen to continue their exercise programs throughout pregnancy, and Mrs Dion emphasizes that she would not recommend following her book if 'you aren’t already doing it.'

The couple also recommend that pregnant women follow their doctor’s advice and listen to their own body in order to pull back from any 
movement that doesn’t feel right.

Mrs Dion admitted that 'half the exercises in the book would have warnings,' which are nowhere to be seen.

In 1985, the American College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) published its guidelines for 
prenatal exercise, cautioning women not to exceed a maximum heart rate 
of 140 beats per minute.

Dr. Raul Artal, a lead author of the 
ACOG guidelines for exercise and pregnancy, said that mothers-to-be 
should simply ask themselves how much risk they want to take.

'Consider that activities with a high 
risk of injury in someone who isn’t pregnant will have the risk 
amplified by some unknown factor for pregnant women,' he said.

When it comes to the effect of exercise 
on the fetus, there are three main areas of concern: hyperthermia, sports 
injuries and oxygen deficit. 

While exercise dramatically increases body
temperature, where the fetus can take on the mother's heat, possibly 
leading to birth defects, there is no research to prove that exercise at high intensities leads to an
increase in birth defects.

Similarly, although studies have shown 
that when unfit women
 exercise at very high intensity levels, uterine blood flow decreases to
 the point where the fetus experiences a serious oxygen deficit, this 
has been shown to rarely occur when the pregnant woman is fit.

To prevent oxygen deficit to the fetus, they ought to breathe normally during strength 
training, because any act of breath holding can reduce oxygen delivery to the placenta.

Sports injuries are also a concern. Doing deep squats, for example, is more likely to cause knee pain in pregnant women because of hormonal changes that can soften and weaken the joints, said Dr Artal.

The Pregnant Athlete aims to provide practical information on how a woman's body changes each month and how to gauge their own limits with workout plans for strength, cardiovascular conditioning, agility, and balance for each stage of pregnancy.

While it is true that the duration, type and intensity of the exercise that pregnant women perform can all affect the fetus’s heart rate, the ACOG emphasizes that is they train regularly, the fetus will be better conditioned and able to adapt to the stresses of exercise.

'The concern arises when a woman performs extreme levels of exercise on an inconsistent basis: then, the effect can be detrimental to the fetus,' explains the ACOG website.
