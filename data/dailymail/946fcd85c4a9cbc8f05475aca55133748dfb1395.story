Andy Murray showed that he is quite prepared to think outside the box by appointing Ivan Lendl, and now he has done it again by appointing Amelie Mauresmo.

The move, the likelihood of which was revealed eleven days ago in Sportsmail, is a groundbreaking one which will make his campaign to defend his Wimbledon title all the more fascinating.

Although initially denied, there always seemed to be something in it when she turned up to watch the whole of his first match at the French Open and reputable sources suggested that contact had been made between them.

Appointment: Andy Murray, training today at Queen's, has appointed Amelie Mauresmo as his new coach

Top job: The two-time Grand Slam winner will take over in time for  Queen's

Murray knew that he could not replicate the presence of Lendl – who had little coaching experience before their famously successful partnership, but what he is looking for is someone who can add that little extra input which, at the rarefied level he plays at, can be the difference between winning and losing.

The appointment is initially for the grasscourt season spanning Queen’s and Wimbledon, but it has very much been made with the longer term in mind.

'I’m excited by the possibilities of the new partnership and Amelie is someone I have always looked up to and admired,' said Murray of the appointment.

'Excited': Murray said Mauresmo was someone he 'always looked up to and admired'

Champ: Mauresmo won Wimbledon in 2006 and the Australian Open in the same year

'She’s faced adversity plenty of times in her career, but was an amazing player and won major titles, including Wimbledon.

'I have a very strong coaching team already in place, but I think Amelie brings with her experience and tactical expertise and will push us all to improve.  Everyone I know talks very highly of Amelie, as a person and coach, and I’m convinced that her joining the team will help us push on - I want to win more grand slams.'

As Murray said in response to Sportsmail’s story that Mauresmo was in the frame, the presence of a woman can tame the egos that sometimes prevail when you have an all-male team.

And she is someone he can respect as she is a proven winner like he is, rather than purely a professional coach who can work as a technician on his game, which is unlikely to radically change anyway at this point of his career.

Previous: Mauresmo already has experience of coaching man, having worked with Michael Llodra

Exit: Murray lost to Rafa Nadal in the semi-finals of the French Open in Paris

Mauresmo was an athletic all court player who won both the Australian Open and Wimbledon, and she herself is an innovative thinker like him who will relish the challenge of taking on such a fascinating individual who always has the capacity to surprise.

This and the pure fact that he is now stepping out on his beloved grass should be a tonic after the thumping he received from Rafael Nadal in Paris on Friday.

Mauresmo also has experience of coaching a man, having worked with Frenchman Michael Llodra over the grass court season of 2010 when he won the Eastbourne ATP event. She was also in the team of Marion Bartoli when she won Wimbledon last year, so she is well qualified on all sides to understand the unique pressures of lasting the whole fortnight at the All England Club.

Tonic: Murray will have to recover from the thumping he took at the hands of Nadal

'I’m really excited to be able to work with Andy,' said Mauresmo, who won Wimbledon and the Australian Open in 2006.

'He’s an amazingly talented tennis player and I feel I have plenty to offer both him and the team around him. I’m looking forward to getting down to work and helping him win more Grand Slams.

A little like Lendl, she may also serve to deflect some of those pressures just by being there on his bench alongside his trusted assistant coach Dani Vallverdu.

She added: 'Andy contacted me a few weeks ago and we started to talk about this possibility to work, to be working together. It's not really something that I was thinking doing when I stopped being a tennis player.

'Then we talked again a little bit more about how to do the things maybe about his game, about different things.

'We came up with the will from both sides to, yeah, to give it a shot.

Contact: Mauresmo said the pair had been discussing working together for a few weeks

Long term: Mauresmo suggested the pair would team not just on a short team basis

'We all know his mother was a big part of his tennis career.

I think he's maybe looking for something different, about emotions and sensitive things. It's not really interesting for me, this part of the story, to be honest. All I'm interested in is to be able to help him in his goals. That's about it. The rest is the story for you to write, I guess.

'But, yeah, for me it's a challenge. I want to take it.'

She clearly suggested that both were looking long term and when asked about how much time they would spend together said: 'Not the whole year, not as full time, but, yes, a significant amount of weeks that we have agreed on and should be good for everyone.'

Women coaching men in professional tennis is not unknown at present but it is highly unusual. Uzbekistan’s Denis Istomin is coached by his mother, while another top 100 player, Kazakhstan’s Mikhail Kukushkin, is coached by his wife Anastasia.

Murray has already drawn praise from many figures in the women’s game such as Chris Evert for contemplating having a woman in charge, and now he has followed through on that.

Sportsmail's tennis correspondent Mike Dickson first revealed the possibility of Mauresmo taking over as Murray's coach on May 27.
