Misfiring Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao might be struggling to win over English fans with his modest scoring return of just four goals from 19 games, but he will be pleased to know his popularity hasn't diminished too much abroad.  

Training with his Colombia team-mates in Barhain ahead of the South American country's mini-Asian tour, Falcao was warmly embraced by one supporter who ran on the pitch to reach him. The young fan, wearing one of United's replica away kits managed to get a selfie with Falcao and the striker's signature on the front of his shirt before being escorted away by security staff. 

Colombia play Bahrain on Thursday before facing Kuwait four days later.

The hug will no doubt come as a lift for Falcao who is under huge pressure to improve his poor club form.

Previously viewed as one of the game's top marksmen while at Porto, Atletico Madrid and Monaco, the Colombian has failed to reach those same heights since agreeing to a big-money loan deal at Old Trafford. 

United manager Louis van Gaal has been so unimpressed with Falcao's performances that the striker has even been made to spend time training with the club's Under-21s team.
