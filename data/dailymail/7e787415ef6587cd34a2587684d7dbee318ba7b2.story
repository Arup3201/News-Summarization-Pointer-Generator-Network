A disappointed cinema-goer has won a refund after complaining that the 2012 Tom Cruise thriller Jack Reacher did not include an explosion featured in its trailer.

The New Zealand film buff, named only as J Congdon, complained to the country's Advertising Standards Authority that the missing explosion was 'the defining part of the ad'.

The scene, which features in the trailer for less than a second, shows a huge detonation which dramatically brings down an entire cliff face.

Misleading advertising: A New Zealand film fan won a refund from Paramount Pictures after noticing that a scene in the trailer for the Tom Cruise film Jack Reacher (pictured) did not appear in the final edit

Paramount Pictures, the film company behind Jack Reacher, admitted the error and agreed to refund the cost of Mr Congdon's ticket.

It said the trailer for the action thriller was released before its final edit had been completed and, as a result, the 'split-second' scene used to promote the film was cut before it made it to the cinema.

But the studio nevertheless defended the trailer, which showed at least two further scenes not featured in the film's final cut.

Mr Congdon made his complaint after seeing the advert on television earlier this year, and noticing that the explosion in the trailer did not appear in the film's final edit when he went to see it in the cinema.

He told the New Zealand ASA that the 'explosion where the whole cliff comes down' was 'the defining part of the ad that made me really want to go see the movie... aside from having Tom Cruise in it.'

Paramount said it was a 'usual and 
longstanding practice in the film industry' that cinema trailers and 
television advertisements be produced weeks or months before editing was
complete, the New Zealand Herald reported.

'Thus,
despite our best intentions, it is always possible that certain scenes 
appearing in an advertisement or trailer may not appear in the final 
version of a film,' the company told the ASA.

It
added: 'The explosion in question was a single split-second element 
omitted from a 130-minute long action film and [we] believe that, taken 
as a whole, the impression created by the advertisement was a true and 
fair reflection of the film which could not reasonably be considered 
misleading or deceptive to customers.'

Deleted scene: The missing explosion the fan called 'the defining part of the ad that made me really want to go see the movie'

Although based on a series of best-selling novels, Jack Reacher had modest worldwide receipts of $212million, with the casting of Tom Cruise in the title role regarded a controversial choice.

A signature feature of the novel's lead character is that he is unusually tall, while Cruise is only 5ft 6in.

MailOnline contacted Paramount to find out why the explosion did not make the final cut, but as yet we have received no response.
