As Australians are beginning to feel the onset of winter's chill, Aussies travellers are looking to escape this year's cold in exchange for a European summer.

Recent data released by KAYAK.com.au has revealed that most Aussies are planning their mid-year getaways in Europe.

Research by the travel search engine further indicates that Aussies are planning to travel abroad between May and August, while seven out of the top ten holiday destinations are in Europe.

Australian tourists are planning to holiday in destinations across Europe, the number one choice being the ancient city of Athens in Greece

1) Athens, Greece

2) Istanbul, Turkey

3) Toronto, Canada

4) Warsaw, Poland

5) Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam

6) Dublin, Ireland

7) Barcelona, Spain

8) Colombo, Sri Lanka

9) Santiago, Chile

10) Vienna, Austria 

Debby Soo, Vice President APAC at KAYAK, says Australians don't seem bothered by the cost of their trip, as long as it means they can stay away from the cold.

'Australia is often thought of as a nation of sun-seekers and the upswing of searches for places like Athens, Istanbul and Ho Chi Minh City support that notion,' she said.

'Destinations like Warsaw, Colombo, and Santiago also suggest Aussies are looking for more diverse escapes. 

'People don't appear to be put off by distance, cost or the time it takes to reach somewhere – especially if it means they get a break from winter.' 

Second of the top 10 destinations Aussies are looking to escape to this winter is Istanbul - the cultural and historical heart of Turkey

Another hotspot among Aussie tourists is Toronto in Canada, according to recent data released by KAYAK.com.au

Fourth of the top 10 list is Warsaw in Poland, where Aussies are planning their mid-year getaways

Number one on the list is the ancient city of Athens in Greece, followed by Istanbul - the cultural and historical heart of Turkey.

The number of Australians heading overseas has also increased in recent years, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

Between 2002 and 2012, the amount of Australians travelling overseas increased from 3.5 million to 8.2 million. 

The strong Australian dollar sees Aussies still keen to spend their hard-earned wages on trips overseas and new experiences and sights. 

Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam is said to be the fifth destinations Aussies are searching for this winter

Dublin, Ireland also makes it on the top 10 planned holiday destinations for Aussie travellers
