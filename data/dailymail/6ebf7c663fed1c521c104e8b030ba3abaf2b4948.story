Manchester City's players had plenty to celebrate on Saturday night after beating Crystal Palace to go level on points with Chelsea at the top of the Premier League table.

Manuel Pellegrini's men let their hair down at Italian restaurant Gusto with their wives and girlfriends just hours after their victory at the Etihad.

Frank Lampard was joined by his TV presenter fiancee Christine Bleakley, while goalscorers against the Eagles, Yaya Toure and David Silva, were also in attendance.

Goalkeeper Joe Hart, who was fortunate to come away with a clean sheet on Saturday after James McArthur had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside, celebrated signing a new long-term contract with his girlfriend Kimberley Crew.

City skipper Vincent Kompany missed the win against Neil Warnock's side through injury but that didn't stop him attending the team meal with his wife Carla.

Utility man James Milner, who started up-front for Pellegrini's side in the absence of injured forwards Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic, was also in attendance with partner Amy Fletcher.

First-team stars including Martin Demichelis, Jesus Navas, Samir Nasri and Bacaray Sagna - all of whom were joined by their partners - were also pictured leaving the restaurant in Manchester City centre on Saturday evening.

Two goals from Silva and another from Toure had given City a comfortable win against Palace hours earlier, a result which moved them level on 39 points with Jose Mourinho's side.

Chelsea will look to regain their three-point advantage at the top of the table with victory at Stoke on Monday night, while City's players will now concentrate on a Boxing Day trip to West Brom. 

Pellegrini's men then face two homes in quick succession against Burnley and Sunderland as the busy festive period rolls on, before an FA Cup third round tie with Championship side Sheffield Wednesday at the Etihad.
