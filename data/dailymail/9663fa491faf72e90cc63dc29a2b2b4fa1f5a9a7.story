With its legions of ice zombies, fearsome dragons and powerful warlocks, it can sometimes seem as if Game of Thrones is a little farfetched.

However, dig below the surface and you will find it is largely based on historical events, as author George RR Martin has admitted himself.

For example, the Wall which separates the kingdom of the North from the wild lands beyond is based on Hadrian's Wall; the Andles, who first separated Westeros into seven kingdoms, are a reference to the Anglo Saxons, who separated England into seven kingdoms.

The war between the Starks and the Lannisters also bears stark similarities to the Wars of the Roses between the English houses of Lancaster and York between 1455 and 1487.

Like the Starks, the House of York were northerners, like the Lannisters the House of Lancaster were southerners and extremely wealthy.

But the parallels don't end there, some of the Lords and Ladies of Westeros bear a striking resemblance to historical figures as well.

WARING: SPOILERS

Robert's own descent into debauchery may have been inspired by that of Edward IV (right)

In his younger days, Robert Baratheon was a fearsome warrior, tough enough to lead a rebellion, overthrow thousands of years of Targeryen rule and establish a new rule with himself as King.

Not unlike a young Edward IV who brought the Yorkist line to the throne in 1461, but later descended into drunkenness and lewd behaviour, much like Robert, his fictional counterpart.

Edward, like Robert, also changed his will on his deathbed, naming a regent as his successor and causing a succession crisis.

Edward died after an accident while fishing, while Robert died after being skewered by a boar.

The lusty Robert, a fan of both wine and hunting, also bear more than a few similarities with Henry VIII, who was also a fierce warrior who later developed a penchant for a feast or two.

Petyr Baelish is a low-born man who worked his way into the court of Robert Baratheon keeping one hand firmly on the purse strings, as did Thomas Cromwell with the court of King Henry VIII

If Robert bears similarities with Henry VIII, then it fits that Petyr Baelish, his master of coin in Game of Thrones, should make an historical parallel with Thomas Cromwell, who played a central role in Henry's court.

Like Cromwell, Baelish is not a high-born man. He worked his way into the King's service using guile, skill, and by keeping a firm grip on the kingdom's purse strings.

Cromwell started life as the son of a brewer, and was a soldier for a time, but later trained as a lawyer and gained skills in accountancy before working himself into the King's court.

However he was a scheming man who betrayed one of his staunchest allies in Anne Boleyn which ultimately saw her executed.

Baelish himself is also a ruthless schemer, had a hand in betraying King Joffrey to his death, and may have helped the Starks on the way to an early grave as well.

In a world of traitors and deviants, Eddard Stark stands for all that is good, just and fair. He was a fearsome warrior, a masterful ruler, and an honorable man, though it eventually betrayed him to his death.

Much like Richard, Duke of York. He fought in the Hundred Year's War in France, and for his success was rewarded with various offices of state, proving an efficient and capable ruler through all of them.

Like Eddard after Robert's death, Richard also became protector of the Kingdom during Henry VI's madness.

However, he had bitter disagreements with Henry's wife, Mary of Anjou, as Ned did with Cersi Lannister. Richard eventually tried to seize the throne but was unsuccessful, mirroring the moment Ned attempts to seize the throne from Joffrey.

Ultimately both Richard and Ned were killed by beheading, and ended up with their heads mounted on spikes. 

Both Cersi and Mary of Anjou were known as schemers who put their own desires before the common good

Henry VI's wife, Margaret of Anjou, was known for being a controlling an scheming woman who often put her own desires above the greater good. She also had disagreements with Richard, Duke of York, and ultimately saw his head put on a spike.

Much like Cersei, who spent most of her time before Robert died disagreeing with Ned Stark - before his head was put on a spike - and most of her time after his death plotting and scheming to get her illegitimate son Joffrey on the Iron Throne and secure her place there.

At the Purple Wedding, she shows she is not averse to putting her own desires ahead of the common good, ordering the spare food from the feat to be thrown to the dogs, rather than being given to the city's poor, as rival Margery Tyrell ordered.

Daenerys and Henry Tudor both raised armies overseas. Later Henry used his to seize the English throne. we can only hop that at some point Daenerys gets around to doing the same

Henry Tudor, later Henry VII, took the throne from Richard III after crossing the channel with a foreign army in tow, marching through his birthplace and recruiting more troops along the way.

For many years before that, however, he lived a life of exile in France while chaos slowly spread in England, waiting for the perfect moment to seize his opportunity.

Not a little unlike Daenerys, who has been slowly amassing a huge army across the Narrow Sea (read: the English Channel) while plotting to invade her birthplace, rallying the loyal to her cause as she goes.

Loyal to his King, but unfaithful to his nephew heirs, Richard III mirrors Stannis Baratheon. But while Richard eventually seized the throne, Stannis has so far fallen short

Stannis, brother of Robert Baratheon, was unfaltering in his loyalty to the King while he was alive, but after Robert's death, declared his own nephews illegitimate and tried to seize the throne for himself using some fairly controversial tactics.

Richard III, brother of King Edward IV, was also loyal up until the point of the King's death, upon which he declared his own nephews illegitimate, and succeeded to the throne after their 'disappearance'.

Both Robb Stark and Edward IV betrayed a promise of marriage, leading formerly close allies to rebel

While Edward's descent into drinking a lasciviousness may have inspired Robert Baratheon's drinking and infidelity, Edward's marriage was undoubtedly what inspired Robb's own tumultuous love-life.

Edward rushed into an impulsive marriage which alienated one of his key allies, the Earl of Warwick, who had arranged for the king to marry the sister-in-law of the French monarch, Louis XI.

The Earl, Richard Neville, later rebelled against Edward as Walder Frey rebelled against Robb, leading to his gruesome death at the Red Wedding.

Frey, as we know, betrayed Robb because the Young Wolf went back on his vow to marry one of Frey's daughters.

Both Theon and George were separated from their parents at a young age following an unsuccessful rebellion. George also betrayed his brother to appease his father-in-law, while Theon betrayed Robb - who he thought of as a brother - to appease his father Baylon

Theon Greyjoy’s story mirrors that of George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence, who betrayed his brother, King Edward IV, to align with his father-in-law, Richard Neville.

In the TV series, Theon betrays Robb, who he was raised to think off as a brother, to gain the admiration of his natural father Baylon.

Both were also separated from their natural parents at a young age, although George's father was killed at the Battle of Wakefield, while Theon was simply sent to live with the Starks.

Joffrey was a ruthless ruler who was cruel to his betrothed, Sansa. Edward Plantagenet was also known for his cruelty, especially to his wife, but was never ruled as he was killed on the battlefield aged 17

Known for an almost unmatched cruelty, Joffrey was one of the last people on Earth you would want to have any semblance of power, let alone rule a kingdom. 

As was the case with Edward Lancaster, who is generally portrayed as a sadistic, bloodthirsty boy who was cruel to his wife, Anne Neville, aka Sansa Stark.

As the son of Mary of Anjou, the historical counterpart of Cersi, who is Joffrey's mother in the series, he was also heir apparent to the English throne.

Luckily for the English, he died aged 17 on the field of battle. Unfortunately for the Kingdom of Westeros, Joffrey didn't.
