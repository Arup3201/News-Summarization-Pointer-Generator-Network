British Gas is mounting an extraordinary attempt to hijack efforts by consumers to contact its rivals.

A partnership with the 118 118 directory enquiry service means callers asking for the number of any energy company are met with a hard sell for British Gas.

The 118 118 operator is required to highlight one of its fixed energy tariffs and talk up an incentive of a £50 high street shopping voucher. The same operator even offers to connect customers who had originally intended to contact a rival to British Gas sales staff.

So a consumer who might originally have been trying to contact a small and cheap firm such as Ovo Energy is pushed towards British Gas instead.

The partnership between British Gas and 118 118 raises new questions about whether consumers can trust the Big Six energy firms to deal fairly with consumers amid allegations of rip-off prices and poor service.

Recent price rises mean that the cost of dialling 118 118 is hugely expensive, with a minimum charge from a landline ranging from £4.45 to £5.68. This bill can rise sharply if the call lasts any longer than necessary.

And those dialling the service pay a fee to get a specific number, so they do not expect to be hit with an advertising message from a third party which may well increase the cost of the call.

Worse still, if connected to British Gas via 118 118 they are then charged £2.57 a minute.

Marc Gander, of the Consumer Action Group, said: ‘I suppose it’s hardly surprising. Two companies, each with a controversial reputation over pricing, finding comfort in each other’s company.

‘The 118 118 service doesn’t offer value for money so our simple advice is don’t bother to dial the directory service.

‘You save money and you don’t have to listen to British Gas advertising. Two birds of a feather with one stone. Simple.’

Energy firms have run into severe trouble over mis-selling. In July British Gas was ordered to pay £1million to customers after selling energy deals to shoppers in Sainsbury’s stores using misleading claims about possible savings. It has lost hundreds of thousands of customers in the past 18 months as families switch to cheaper independent rivals.

The deal being promoted by 118 118 involves fixing energy tariffs until the end of March 2016. It suggests this will lead to an average annual bill of £1,193 and comes with a £50 High Street gift voucher. However, cheaper fixed rate deals are available. Ovo Energy, for example, has a 12-month deal with an annual average bill of £1,011.

British Gas said: ‘British Gas advertises in a variety of ways, including this type of paid-for promotion. It is similar to paying for adverts that appear on the internet alongside search engine results.’

The 118 118 service is operated by The Number, a subsidiary of US directory enquiries provider Knowledge Generation Bureau.A spokesman said: ‘When customers request a specific number, our call agents always supply it quickly and accurately.

‘Occasionally we have some great special offers that are related to their enquiry.

Fair? The partnership between British Gas and 118 118 raises new questions about whether consumers can trust the Big Six energy firms to deal fairly with consumers amid allegations of rip-off prices and poor service

‘If customers are interested in this offer, our call agents ask whether they would like the additional number of the company that is offering the promotion. We’re keen to bring added value to our customers.’

The firm said its activities comply with the industry code of practice covering premium rate telephone lines, policed by watchdog PhonepayPlus.

Ovo commercial director David Gooch said: ‘This is not the way to rebuild trust in an industry currently suffering from the lowest level of customer confidence in its history.

‘We urge customers to shop around for the best deals and not to fall for these sorts of aggressive marketing tactics which often results in signing up to a deal that is more expensive.’
