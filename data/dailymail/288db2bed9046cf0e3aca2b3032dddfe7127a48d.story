It was third time unlucky for Andrea Nunn. Eight years ago she twisted her knee jumping out of a horse box. Four years later she hurt it again while walking her dog. Each time, Andrea limped for a few days but didn’t go to hospital. However, on the third occasion in spring last year she knew it was serious.

‘I was standing up from putting washing in the tumble dryer when I heard an almighty bang in my knee and I doubled over in agony,’ she recalls.

Andrea, 35, had become a victim of one of the most common injuries suffered by Britons. Every year one in 600 people damage or rupture their anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), one of the four ligaments that stabilise the knee joint.

Over the agony: Six months after the 'origami' surgery to her knee, Andrea Nunn can ride her horses again

Traditional treatment involves grafting two hamstring tendons – from the three that run down the back of the leg – into the knee joints to replace the ACL. The drawback is that it can significantly reduce the strength of the leg.

Now an operation called the Translateral All Inside technique for ACL Reconstruction is transforming the prospects of patients, reducing recovery time and increasing leg strength. It has also been dubbed the origami technique as it involves folding over just one hamstring tendon four times to make it stronger.

The knee is the largest joint in the body. The thigh and shin bones form a hinge joint, and the patella, or knee cap, sits over them and slides as the leg moves. The ligaments are crucial to this structure. These are strong, fibrous cables of tissue connecting the bones. The anterior cruciate ligament runs diagonally from front to back within the knee.

One of the major problems with ACL injury is that it is often not picked up until the problem is severe.

‘The injury tends to occur on the sports field – playing football, hockey, netball or rugby,’ says Mr Adrian Wilson, consultant orthopaedic surgeon at North Hampshire Hospital, Basingstoke.

‘Damage is usually caused by a twisting movement, such as changing direction suddenly. Many people go to accident and emergency but 90 per cent of the time  an X-ray comes back clear so they are sent home.’

Although the swelling goes down, the patient often sees a GP within a few weeks because of continuing pain.

‘They
may or may not be referred to a knee specialist, but by the time they 
get an appointment they are five or six months down the line,’ says Mr 
Wilson. ‘Should they be fortunate enough to be referred for a repair, by
the time the operation is performed it may have been 18 months since 
the original injury.’

Not only will patients have been in a great deal of pain but they may also have suffered irreparable damage to the knee joint – including cartilage tears and joint-surface damage.

‘An operation will halt the process of deterioration and stabilise the knee,’ says Mr Wilson. ‘Left untreated, patients will eventually need a knee replacement.’

Mr Wilson’s new technique, which he developed mainly at North Hampshire Hospital with his NHS team, uses just one hamstring tendon.

He says: ‘Taking two significantly reduces hamstring strength and it takes a year to recover. Our technique takes half the time to recover. Everyone limps for a few weeks, but after six months our patients are pretty much back to normal.’

The operation takes about an hour under general anaesthetic. First the surgeon makes a keyhole incision about 2in below the knee on the inside. Through that, a long spear-like instrument is inserted and used to cut a single hamstring from the bone at either end.

‘We used to make a large incision from knee to groin to locate and take out the hamstring,’ says Mr Wilson. ‘But we have found that by cutting the point that anchors the tendon to the bone, we can slide the hamstring out. It’s a flat ribbon, about 1cm wide and 0.5mm thick – a bit like pappardelle pasta.’

Next, the surgeon removes the broken ACL and drills a socket where it once attached to either side of the knee joint.

‘The hamstring is folded four times, a bit like origami, and stitched together to make it very strong,’ says Mr Wilson. ‘Sutures are attached at either end, and these are fed through a thinner tunnel a couple of millimetres in diameter, then anchored to the outside of the knee with little buttons.’

Mr Wilson has performed it on more than 150 patients and interest in the technique is growing globally. Andrea is one of the lucky few to have benefited so far. After her collapse in the spring, her boyfriend, Jamie Whitehorn, 47, who works in IT, drove her to hospital.

Andrea says: ‘They said there was nothing broken and gave me a metal brace which reached from ankle to thigh. I was in agony. Even after a week, I’d walk a few steps and my knee would wobble.’

A physiotherapist she saw a fortnight later referred her for an MRI scan. ‘I had to wait two months for this, and then a further seven for the operation.’

During this time Andrea wore the knee brace constantly. ‘I couldn’t walk far. To hold the knee straight it had to be fastened tightly so it was very uncomfortable.’

Normally very active – riding her two horses daily, cycling to work and walking her dog – Andrea says she lost a stone through muscle-wastage. ‘My life changed. Everything I took for granted had gone. I felt depressed,’ she admits.

When she heard of Mr Wilson’s operation, she decided to go for it. ‘I met someone who had undergone the old operation and they were left limping. I just wanted to get back to normal. After the operation, I felt no pain at all and was on my feet within 12 hours. The knee felt solid and firm and I could walk with crutches.’

Although she was absent from her office job for two weeks, Andrea was able to spend the following month at work with her feet up on a box of files.

‘My boyfriend looked after the horses and walked the dogs, but I’ve been riding again for a few weeks now and it’s fantastic to be back in the saddle,’ she says.
