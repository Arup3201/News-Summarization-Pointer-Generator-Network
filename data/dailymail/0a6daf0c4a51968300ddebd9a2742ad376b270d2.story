A Dutch entertainer is being sued for threatening to sell the secret behind one of Penn & Teller's signature magic tricks for just $3,050.

Raymond Teller, the smaller and silent member of the pair, is taking legal action against Gerard Dogge after he posted online a video offering to expose the method behind his 'Shadows' illusion.

Dogge, whose stage name is Gerard Bakardy, asked viewers at the end of 'The Rose & Her Shadow' clip he posted on YouTube last month to cough up the cash.

Original: Raymond Teller claims he owns the copyright to the trick, which he says he invented in his bedroom as a teenager

Teller, who claims to have the copyright to the trick, contacted Dogge after seeing the video - which he also demanded YouTube remove from its site.

Knowing that legal action would probably be more costly, he first offered to pay the fee himself. But Dogge is said to 'have countered with a much higher sum'.

He then threatened to sell the secret if Teller did not 'come to terms soon', according to the legal complaint filed in the federal court of Las Vegas this week.

Teller is seeking a permanent halt to any copyright infringement, plus damages.

The complaint states: 'Shadows is the oldest, most venerated piece of material in Penn & Teller's show and has been performed thousands of times.'

The illusion involves a spotlight shown on a vase containing a rose, with the shadow of a rose projected onto a white screen.

Illusion: Teller then uses a knife to sever leaves and petals of the shadow, whereupon the corresponding leaves and petals on the rose in the vase fall to the ground

According to a certificate of copyright registration filed with the complaint, the illusion was copyrighted in 1983 by Teller, a pseudonym for Raymond Teller.    

'This gothic pantomime has been performed by its creator over 1,100 times since 1976,' the January 1983 certificate shows.

Teller has claimed to have created the trick as a teenager in his bedroom, and it is described in the lawsuit as having 'iconic quality'.

Penn Jillette, who makes the magic pair, has also described it as 'probably the best bit in our show'.

Stars: Penn & Teller starred alongside Jonathan Ross in the ITV show Fool Us, which saw them take on amateur magicians who tried to wow them with their tricks

One offs: Penn & Teller uniquely combine comedy and magic for their show, which has wowed audiences for more than 20 years

Jason Alexander, star of television comedy Seinfeld, is one of the trick’s biggest fans, once telling a documentary: 'The first time I saw Teller do the shadow illusion, I actually cried.

'There are moments when magic is so poetic that it just catches me.'

The battle is sure to rock Magic Circles across the world, who insist members do not share secrets in order to maintain the so-called 'Magician's Code'.

Dogge, who regularly performs with his wife at a hotel in Fuerteventura, Canary Islands, has not commented publicly on the action.
