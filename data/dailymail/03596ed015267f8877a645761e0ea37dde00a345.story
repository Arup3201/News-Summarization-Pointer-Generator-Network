Numbers of a British seabird have fallen so low that experts fear the breed could soon become the first victim of climate change.

One breeding colony of the Kittiwake in Scotland is now extinct and others are predicted to disappear within three years, according to wildlife experts.

The sea bird, one of the most abundant in the world, is disappearing at an 'alarming' rate, the Royal Protection for the Society of Birds (RSPB) said.

End of the road? Experts say the Kittiwake sea bird could face extinction in Scotland within three years

Conservationists say the decline is down to alterations to the marine environment brought on by climate change, with the North Sea's food chain being 'profoundly affected'.

The population of Kittiwake has more than halved in the UK since the mid-1980s and the breeding numbers in Scotland have declined by almost two-thirds.

The far north of Scotland has seen some of the steepest declines, particularly in Shetland and Orkney where about one fifth of the UK Kittiwake population return to breed each year.

However, in just over a decade, experts have recorded a massive 82 per cent decline in breeding pairs at Orkney's 'seabird cities'.

Counts undertaken by the RSPB and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) also revealed populations on the Orkney mainland fell from nearly 11,000 pairs in 2000 to under 2,000 this year.

Kittiwakes failed to return to the 'once-bursting' cliff colony of Orkney's Mull Head this year - and cliffs at Costa Head Birsay held less than 200 breeding pars.

Three other colonies are 'hanging on by a thread; with fewer than 90 nests each - indicating potential local extinction within the next three years.

Doug
Gilbert, RSPB Scotland Head of Reserves Ecology, said: 'The counts this
year are deeply shocking, especially the loss of kittiwakes at Mull 
Head. We know that kittiwakes in other parts of Orkney are equally 
affected, and to think of Orkney without thriving colonies of these 
fantastic birds is a sad prospect.

The Kittiwake is a medium-sized gull with a small yellow bill and a dark eye, a grey back but with a white underside

It feeds on fish, shrimps and worms.

In flight, its black-tipped wings look as though they are 'dipped in ink'

In the breeding season, this coastal gull can be found in seabird colonies around the UK

In late summer and autumn it can be 
seen flying past offshore, or collecting at roosts, while it spends the 
winter months out at sea

The best time to see them is on breeding grounds in spring and summer

'It
now appears undeniable that the declines in kittiwake and other 
seabirds are being driven by changes in the marine environment related 
to climate change. The food chain of the North Sea is being profoundly 
affected, and seabirds, at the top of the chain, are suffering.

'Everyone with an interest in our seas and their health should be paying attention to this.

'Seabirds
remain largely unprotected at sea and have been marginalised in the 
identification of new Marine Protected Areas- this obvious gap needs to 
be filled if Scotland is going to prove it is serious about protecting 
threatened wildlife.'

Most of the breeding kittiwakes - 1,134 pairs - were found at RSPB Scotland's Marwick Head nature reserve, but these numbers were 75 per cent lower than in 1999, when 5,400 pairs were nesting.

The Sumburgh Head nature reserve in Shetland also reported a poor year, with only a few chicks hatching. However, a kittiwake colony at Troup Head on the Moray Firth experienced its best season in years with more than 500 chicks fledging.

Meanwhile, a colony in Aberdeenshire which had been described as being in 'freefall' has seen a halt in the long-term decline of Kittiwake numbers. Experts have been encouraged by the number of chicks in recent years.

The RSPB said a fuller picture of this year's seabird breeding season will be available in the autumn.
