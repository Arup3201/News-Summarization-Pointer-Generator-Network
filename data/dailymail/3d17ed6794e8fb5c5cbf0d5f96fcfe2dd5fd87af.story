Delighted Stacey Hobden carries daughter Madison, two, after battling back from a rare and crippling illness

A mother has told of her joy at being able to carry her daughter again for the first time since she was a baby, after being struck down by a rare and crippling illness.

Stacey Hobden, 22, from West Denton, Newcastle, was left semi-paralysed after contracting the nervous system disorder Guillian-Barre syndrome over a year ago.

The disease, which affects just one in 100,000 people, caused her to loose all feeling in her hands and feet and left her unable to walk.

But worst of all it meant she was unable to care for daughter Madison, who was then just nine -months-old.

But after battling back for over a year, Mrs Hobden has finally regained the strength to carry Maddison, now two, for the first time.

She said: 'Words can't describe how I feel to be able to hold Maddison.

'It's almost like having a part of myself back. I haven't been able to hold her since she was seven months old.

'At long last I just feel like I can be a mam again.'

Mrs Hobden caught an apparently relatively harmless sickness bug but when she was unable to fight it off she was admitted to hospital.

Two weeks later, after a battery of tests, the mother-of-one was diagnosed with the disease, which not only left her unable to walk, but also affected her so much that she could not even hold Madison.

She is currently attending Walkergate Park Centre in the East End of Newcastle, where she is undergoing intensive physiotherapy and rehabilitation work with the medical and nursing staff.

She said: 'I'm getting much better now and I can walk around the house. I am still not back to the way I was but I'm using my mobility scooter to get out and about outside.'

Mrs Hobden and her husband Paul, 26, originally from Brighton, met seven years ago and had tried for a baby for five years.

But agonisingly, the qualified nursery nurse suffered 14 miscarriages. The couple were delighted when she then gave birth to Maddison.

Mrs Hobden, who already suffered from fibromyalgia, a long-term condition that causes pain all over the body, spent eight weeks at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary.

She is now hoping to set up a charity which offers help to other people in the region suffering from Guillian-Barre syndrome.

She said: 'There just doesn't seem to be anything out there to support people at our age with Guillian-Barre syndrome.'

Guillain-Barr√© is a rare and unusual condition that occurs when the body's immune system attacks parts of the nervous system.

The exact cause of the syndrome is unknown, but symptoms usually begin to develop one to three weeks after a minor infection, such as a cold or sore throat.

The symptoms, which include pain, tingling and numbness and muscle weakness, often start in the feet and hands before spreading to thearms and then your legs.

Sufferers may also experience co-ordination problems and unsteadiness.

The weakness normally affects both sides of the body and it may get worse over several days.

Most sufferers (around 80 per cent) make a full recovery. However that can involve spending weeks in hospital and it may take a year or more to fully recover.

About one or two people in every 10 will not recover completely from Guillain-Barre syndrome, although others can make a full recovery.

Long-term complications include not being able to walk unaided, a loss of sensation, loss of balance and muscle weakness in the arms or legs.
