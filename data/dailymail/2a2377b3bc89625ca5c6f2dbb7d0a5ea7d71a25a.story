It has been a summer Tim Krul will never forget.

From the euphoria of being thrust on to the global stage as Holland's penalty shootout hero in their World Cup quarter-final win over Costa Rica, to the devastation of the MH17 disaster which claimed the lives of 193 of his compatriots and two Newcastle fans.

It was on July 5 in Salvador, Brazil that Krul, Holland's substitute goalkeeper, was brought on by Louis van Gaal following a goalless 120 minutes.

The 26-year-old saved two spot-kicks and made headlines around the world as the Dutch advanced to the semi-final – he was a national hero.

But just 12 days later he was left in a state of shock and distress as news broke from Ukraine. A Malaysian Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur - carrying 298 passengers and crew - had been shot down killing all on board, including Newcastle fanatics John Alder, 63, and Liam Sweeney, 28, on their way to watch their team play in New Zealand.

Krul, enjoying a post World Cup holiday at the time, was sickened.

'You go from such a high to real life and lives being taken. It's sick,' said Krul, who was born and raised in The Hague before signing for Newcastle as a 17-year-old.

'I have two families – in Holland and in Newcastle. I get shivers just thinking about it. It's such a tragedy.

'So many people who have nothing to do with any conflict out there to be shot down, and so many families affected, it's just disgusting when you think about it. It's hard to think of words to describe it.'

Events in Ukraine, of course, put the relative highs and lows of football into perspective.

But Krul admits that his World Cup experience less than two weeks earlier had ranked as 'the best of his life'.

'It's what you dream of as a little boy, going to a World Cup, and the experience did not disappoint – it was amazing,' he said.

'It was mad. After beating Spain in the first game I was like “Ah well, he (Louis van Gaal, then Holland manager) is not going to change a winning team now, is he?”.

'And then that moment came in the quarter-final. Before we went to the stadium the goalkeeper coach pulled me over and said there was a big chance they would use me if penalties arrive.

'At the time I thought, “Yeah, good one, it probably won't happen”. Then the game went on and we hit the post, the crossbar and missed so many chances.

'I started itching more and more and got the call to get warmed up and it was just a surreal moment.

'I was not allowed to tell anyone either but I was doing my stretching and all sorts and the boys were looking at me thinking, “What's going on?”.

'And when the moment came it was the best 10 minutes of my life, as well as my little girl being born of course.

'It was surreal but it is what you work for and work towards. It gave me such a boost – that's where I want to be, on that stage.'

Krul, though, was a reserve again for the semi-final with Argentina in Sao Paulo. Again, however, Van Gaal's plan was to use his penalty specialist should the tie go the distance.

That it did, following another stalemate. But by that point Van Gaal had been forced to use his final substitute. Holland were beaten and Krul was left to reflect on what might have been.

'For the semi-final the manager was going to use me again,' he revealed in an interview with BBC Newcastle.

'It's just a shame (Robin) Van Persie was knackered and had to come off. He was ill before the game and ran out of steam. So (Klaas-Jan) Huntelaar had to go on. It was disappointing to go out.'

That disappointment, of course, was soon forgotten.

In the wake of MH17 Newcastle's St James' Park became a shrine to Liam and John. Football fans from across the world paid tribute, including a fund set up by a Sunderland supporter which raised nearly £33,000.

Krul is now back in Newcastle, the place he has called home for eight years. He and his team-mates are preparing for the new season with the added motivation of giving something back in memory of Liam and John.

Krul went on: 'The reaction has been very good and shows how together everybody is in the North East. And that has been the same in Holland.

'John had only missed one game in 30 years, that just shows you what a commitment he had and what a commitment Geordies have. That will give us such a boost to give the fans something back because they follow us everywhere.'

And everywhere they do go, those supporters and Tim Krul, in particular, will never forget the summer of 2014.
