A pensioner was left covered in blood after a thug knocked him to the ground during a violent neighbourhood parking dispute.

Lee Cairns, 43, of Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, took a 'running leap' at Stan Roberts, 79, and punched him in the face during the row in North Shields. 

Mr Roberts suffered cuts and bruises to his nose and cheek, as well as damaged teeth, and said he had 'never been punched so hard in my life'.

Mr Roberts suffered cuts and bruises to his nose and cheek, as well as damaged teeth, and said he had 'never been punched so hard in my life'

The attack took place while Mr Roberts was visiting his ex-wife Yejide Roberts, 38, at her home.

The court heard how Cairns' daughter Kelly Lamb, a mother of one, had knocked on Mrs Roberts's door, asking her to move her vehicle from outside Ms Lamb's home.

But, despite Mr Roberts moving the car, a heated row broke out in the street between Mrs Roberts and Ms Lamb. 

The court heard how, minutes later, Cairns stormed down the path and began hurling abuse at Mr and Mrs Roberts.

He then attacked the pensioner, punching him once to the face with such force that he collapsed.

Before fleeing the scene, Cairns and Lamb then kicked the door of Mrs Roberts's car, leaving a visible dent.

Then, when police arrived to arrest Cairns at his home, he snatched a baton from one officer and threatened to 'take his head off'. 

Maimuna Bappa, prosecuting at North Tyneside Magistrates' Court, said: 'There was an argument about where Yejinde had parked and it escalated outside the house with Mr Cairns appearing on the scene.

'At this time the victim remained in the house - he is 79 and suffers from heart problems - but he observed that the dispute was getting out of hand.

'When he stepped out the door, he saw the defendant running down the path to him, draw back his right fist and then punch him in the face.

'He was bleeding heavily from the nose and collapsed back in the house by the living room floor.' 

The court heard how, after attacking Mr Roberts, Cairns and Lamb both kicked his ex-wife's car before fleeing from the scene. Mr Roberts had gone to visit his former partner when the incident took place 

Ms Bappa said Cairns then became aggressive while being put under arrest.

The court heard how, while one hand was cuffed, he used the other hand to pull the baton from the officer's belt.

He said: 'He raised it above his head and threatened to hit the officer. He said he would "take the officer's head off" with the baton.'  

Cairns, who admitted assault, criminal damage and assaulting a police officer, has now been jailed for 22 weeks.

He was also ordered to pay £750 compensation to Mr Roberts and must abide by a two-year restraining order. 

Speaking after the court case, Mr Roberts said that his ex-wife had been left 'a bag of nerves' following the ordeal.

He said: 'I am glad he has gone away for what he has done to me and to my ex-wife.

'I am 80 this year and I am starting to feel my age and this certainly hasn't helped. I now see my GP on a regular basis for hedaches and the attack has made the arthritis in my knees worse from being knocked down.

'Yejide is now a bag of nerves and isn't able to use public transport anymore. She is getting counselling and hopes to restart her nursing training soon.

'This has gone on since last July and we are pleased it is over. We hope it is behind us now. He now has time in prison to reflect on what he has done.' 

Nigerian-born Mrs Roberts add that she had since moved home because of the incident.

She said: 'It's affected me so badly. I had to move house and I hardly ever leave the house now in case I bump into them in the street.

'It has left me a nervous wreck and affected my career as a student nurse. I hope they get punished.'  

Chief magistrate Evelyn Harrison said: 'This was a nasty assault on an elderly gentleman, inflicting quite serious injuries and it has had a long-lasting physical and psychological impact.'  

Richard Haswell, mitigating, said his client suffers from mental health issues and 'behaved poorly' during a neighbourhood dispute.

He added: 'He thought his family was being threatened. The only thing that separates him from his daughter is one punch.'  

Last month, Lamb admitted  criminal damage and was given an 18-month conditional discharge, as well as being fined more than £400 in compensation and costs.
