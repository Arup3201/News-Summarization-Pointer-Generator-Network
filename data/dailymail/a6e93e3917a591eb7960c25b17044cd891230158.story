A Spice Girls fan has been evicted from his home after constantly playing the girl band's number one hit - Viva Forever.

Gavin Townroe, 34, played the 1998 love ballad so loudly that one nearby resident had to be signed off sick from work due to lack of sleep.

Other neighbours at the same block of flats, in Nottingham, would even leave their homes just to get away from the constant sound of the popstars - dubbed Sporty, Baby, Posh, Scary and Ginger  - which would be repeatedly played at all hours.

Police began investigating Townroe last year after numerous reports from people living nearby about the music coming from his council flat.

He was initially given an ASBO demanding he keep the volume down after officers noted noise levels at his home.

Then, in October last year he was given a six week suspended jail term after a court heard he breached the order by carrying on with his noisy antics.

Today Nottingham City Council revealed they have now succeeded in evicting him from the flat.

At a possession hearing last Monday at Nottinghamshire County Court he was now told he must vacate his property by February 4 and pay costs of £913.

Enforcement officer Wayne Cliff said: 'Despite being warned, Mr Townroe had a total disregard for his neighbours.

'At times the volume was so loud residents would leave their properties to escape the music.'

Nottingham Labour councillor Alex Norris added: 'There was a total disregard for other residents' enjoyment of their homes.

'This behaviour has lost him his tenancy.'

Digby Court, where Townroe lived, is run by Nottingham City Homes and is one of five blocks of flats in Lenton.

Gill Moy, director of housing at Nottingham City Homes, said after the case: 'The playing of loud music at all times is unacceptable and something we take very seriously.

'Neighbours should never be subjected to anti social behaviour like this.'

One of his neighbours, Salah Alsayed, 33, yesterday revealed he had first complained about Townroe in January 2011.

He said: 'As well as the Spice Girls, it was different music too - rock, dance, R and B. I like music too - but not like that.

'Friday, Saturday, you don't mind, but seven days a week is very difficult to deal with.

'Sometimes it would happen at seven, eight o'clock in the morning - I don't mind the Spice Girls but not at that time in the morning.'
