Mark Serwotka, head of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, said there 'definitely' were discussions about 'generalised strike action'

Millions of workers will join the first general strike since 1926 as they send a message to the Coalition that they will 'not simply accept their lot', it has today been reported.

Mark Serwotka, head of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, which represents the civil service and other government agencies, said there 'definitely' were discussions about 'generalised strike action'.

He said unions were co-ordinating in a bid to fight back against cuts to pay, jobs and pensions in the public sector, the Daily Telegraph reports.

It comes after months of speculation about a general strike, and days after leaked papers from Britain's biggest union Unite revealed possible plans for a general walkout. 

But Mr Serwotka is the first trade union leader to publicly confirm that there were active discussions.

He told Sky News; 'My own opinion is that what the Government is doing is getting so increasingly unpopular that even a 24-hour strike involving millions of people across the economy will be an incredibly important moment.'

Today thousands of HM Revenue and Customs staff, members of the PCS, are expected to take part in a half-day walkout, coinciding with the start of the new tax year.

Britain's previous general strike came in May 1926 following a dispute over reduced wages for coal miners.

After the miners  were locked out from work, the TUC called on its 1.7million members to walk out of their jobs in solidarity.

Last-minute negotiations with prime minister Stanley Baldwin's government were called off after the Daily Mail's printers refused to print an editorial criticising the proposed strike as a 'revolutionary move'.

The workers participating in the general strike included railway workers, dockers and steelworkers.

Thousands of volunteers and special constables tried to replace the lost labour, and after nine days the TUC admitted defeat and called off the action.

Then from 1978 to 1979, the Winter of Discontent saw a public sector strike under Lord Callaghan's Government, which resulted in power cuts and piles of rubbish on streets.

The strikes, which called for bigger pay rises, had even seen gravediggers join picket lines and leave dead bodies waiting to be buried.

The PCS began a three-month campaign of protest over pay, jobs and conditions on Budget day -  March 20.

Mr Serwotka warned that the strike today would be followed by further action in Whitehall over the next two months.

A document drawn up by Unite and leaked last week described a general strike as 'desirable'.

Fellow union, Unison, which has 1.3million members, said it would back proposals for a general strike as long as it was the end, not the beginning, of a protest campaign.

The threat of co-ordinated industrial
action comes after unions voted overwhelmingly last September to start 
planning the ‘practicalities’ of the first general strike since 1926  at the Trade Unions Congress.

The idea was put forward by the Prison Officers 
Association.

Unite, Unison and the GMB all backed a motion to consider 
the 'practicalities' of a general strike.

But other, less radical, are likely to be opposed to the idea.

If it goes ahead, a general strike 
would wipe out vital services, with workers from teachers to prison 
guards, firemen to nurses, dinner ladies to paramedics likely to walk 
out.

A general strike would cause more upheaval than previous protests against the Coalition as it would encompass both the public and private sector.
