When you see a group of women in pretty dresses, you might not immediately think of engineering.

But one award-winning engineer has taken part in a modelling campaign to convince women that it is possible to shape skylines and take charge of construction sites, while still being feminine.

Roma Agrawal is wearing a floral outfit in Marks and Spencer’s new 'Leading Ladies' campaign alongside famous actresses and pop stars in a bid to change the image of engineering, which she believes is in need of a serious makeover.

The 30-year-old structural engineer has designed bridges, skyscrapers and sculptures with signature architects and spent six years working on The Shard – the tallest building in Western Europe that has radically altered the London skyline.

Ms Agrawal, an Associate at consultancy WSP in London started work on the massive skyscraper in 2006 and spent two years preparing the site before the tower could be built.

‘I worked on the foundation design and the spire. We used top-down construction, which means digging downwards and building up at the same time,’ she told MailOnline.

‘The “core” or spine of the building has never been built that way before, but it saves time and helped us get the building up quickly.’

The spire is Ms Agrawal’s favourite part of The Shard, as all the details including every nut and bolt is on show.

‘You can tell who the engineers are [up the skyscraper] as they are looking up at The Shard and not at the view,’ she said.

Ms Agrawal was sad when the massive construction was completed in November 2012 but is now working on an entirely different  project – the refurbishment of a Georgian town house – as well as a residential development in east London that ‘is technically very demanding’ as it is over a railway line.

‘There’s lots of wasted land around railway lines so it’s good to provide housing near them,’ she mused.

However it is her role in Marks and Spencer’s latest advertising campaign that is Ms Agrawal’s very latest pursuit.

The campaign was shot by photographer Annie Leibovitz and its cast includes Rita Ora, Annie Lennox and Emma Thompson.

While Ms Agrawal describes her inclusion in the advert as ‘surreal’ she believes it is ‘an amazing way to showcase engineering to a new audience, especially women’.

Of course floral skirts are sometimes just not practical on a construction site,  but she believes the campaign shows ‘that the profession can be for women who are feminine and into fashion.’

‘Engineering has an image problem. We need a re-brand of what engineers can look like.'

Currently less than 10 per cent of engineers are women, but the situation is improving. The graduate intake at Ms Agrawal’s workplace, WSP group is 30 per cent female.

The only way is up: Ms Agrawal (pictured left) thinks that The Shard (right) will not be the last radical change to the capital's skyline as she thinks more high rise residential blocks are needed to provide homes for Londoners. The Shard boasts 30 acres of space on a one acre plot

‘My pet peeve is construction toys for boys and cupcake and cleaning toys for girls. I’d love to take those images away and we have to keep talking about the benefits of careers in science and engineering in schools,’ she said.

As well as trying to persuade more girls to pursue a career in engineering, Ms Agrawal is passionate about London’s housing.

She said: ‘The London skyline will change. We need good, well designed skyscrapers to resolve the housing crisis. We can’t have people commuting for hours every day to get to work so we must build good quality, well designed residential housing blocks.

‘And one big positive is they’ll be great views for residents.'
