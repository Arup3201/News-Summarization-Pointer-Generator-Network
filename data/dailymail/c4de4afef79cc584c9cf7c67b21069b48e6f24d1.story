Speaking at a memorial service just hours after the Sunday afternoon shooting at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City in Overland Park, Kansas, Mindy Corporan, the mother of Dr. William Lewis Corporan, and his grandson, Reat Griffin Underwood, repeatedly thanked the people in the audience for being there and talked more about the two victims.

'I'm in shock,' Mrs. Corporan said, looking remarkably composed given what she has gone through. But I want you know I appreciate you all being here.'

Mindy Corporan, the daughter of Dr. William Lewis Corporan and mother of Reat Griffin Underwood, both killed in Sunday's shooting at a Kansas City Jewish community center, speaks out at a memorial service Sunday night

Shortly after speaking, Mrs. Corporan introduced herself as the mother of Underwood and Dr. Corporan's daughter, prompting gasps from the crowd. She also referred to her father as 'Popeye.'

She said she came on the scene shortly after the shooting, before police and ambulances had arrived. But she knew right away Dr. Corporan and Mr. Underwood were already in heaven. 'I know they are in heaven together,' she said.

Mrs. Corporan said Dr. Corporan got selected to take Mr. Underwood to the community center for a theater tryout since she was busy with another son at lacrosse and her mother was busy with cousins.

'I want to let you know how much Reat loved school...loved signing and acting,' Mrs. Corporan said.

Victim: Corporan, pictured left, and Underwood, right, were Christians attending a singing contest at the center 

At
 one point, she apologized for not knowing about another person killed 
as part of the gunman's rampage at the Village Shalom senior living 
facility several blocks away. However, she asked the crowd to pray for 
that victim, a female, and her family. Her name is not yet been released.

Mrs. Corporan also said that despite the tragedy that has struck her family, she will go on living.

'I want you all to know that we are going to have more life and I want you all to have more life,' she said.

Mrs. Corporan (in red sweatshirt) said that she came upon the scene before police and paramedics arrived, but already knew her son and father were in heaven together

The
 Sunday shooting is believed to be fueled by anti-Semitism. However. Dr.
 Corporan and Mr. Underwood were Christian, not Jewish.

Close: The doctor practiced family medicine in Marlow and Duncan Oklahoma, retiring in 2003. He and his wife of 49 years moved to the Kansas City area to be closer to their grandchildren

Police
 arrested 73-year-old Frazier Glenn Cross. He was booked on a charge of 
first degree murder, according to the Johnson County, Kansas, Sheriff's 
Office. The suspect appears to have a long history of KKK involvement 
and anti-Semitism under the name Frazier Glenn Miller.

Authorities
 said they don't think he knew the victims. They have declined to say if
 they think the attack was motivated by anti-Semitism but they are 
investigating the possibility it was a hate crime.

Led away: The shooter, later identified as Frazier Glenn Cross,  is taken away from the scene after being apprehended in an elementary school in Kansas City on Sunday afternoon

Miller is not from Kansas City and was carrying a handgun when he was 
arrested, though he used a shotgun in the rampage. He also reportedly 
had possession of an assault weapon.

Corporan had taken Reat to the community center to audition for KC Superstars, which was being held at the center's theater.

The
 doctor practiced family medicine in Marlow and Duncan Oklahoma, 
retiring in 2003. He and his wife of 49 years moved to the Kansas City 
area to be closer to their grandchildren.

The statement described Corporon as a devoted family man who cherished his family more than anything.

The
 teen was a freshman at Blue Valley High School who enjoyed debating, 
theatre, and had a beautiful voice, the family statement reads. He was 
also an Eagle Scout.

The boy and his grandfather regularly went camping and hunting together.

The

 identities of the victims were released just hours after Miller was 
accosted by police and reportedly screamed out 'Heil Hilter' as he 
was led away. He was taken into custody outside Valley Park Elementary 
at 2:45 p.m.

The Aurora, 
Missouri, man in the 1980s was the 'grand dragon' of the Carolina 
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and subsequently a founder of the White 
Patriot Party, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which 
monitors hate groups. The group said he'd been in the KKK movement 
nearly his entire life.

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback called the shootings 'senseless.'

'We will pursue justice aggressively for these victims,' Brownback said in a statement.
