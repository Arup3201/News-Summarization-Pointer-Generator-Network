Sending a package abroad? Here's a word of advice: Pick your airline carefully.

A hilarious video has captured the care - or distinct lack there of - taken by an air freight handler at Guangzhou airport in China recently.

The worker energetically ditches a trolley full of boxes in the general vicinity of a conveyer belt, which is supposed to transport them inside the airplane. But only a few actually hit their target, with most landing on the tarmac with a crash.

Crash: A hilarious video has captured the care - or distinct lack there of - taken by air freight handlers at Guangzhou airport in China

Filming out the window, a passenger on the China Southern Airlines flight is astounded at the bizarre technique.

'These blokes don't give a damn,' the Australian passenger, Mark Bridgman, says on the tape, which he later uploaded to YouTube.

'What a half-witted idiot. More end up on the ground than are going on the conveyer belt.'

'Don't put your air freight with China Southern,' he adds.

Fragile? The boxes are chucked aggressively in the direction of the conveyor belt

Cleaning up: The worker has to handle all the boxes twice because so few of them made the conveyor belt the first time

'He's going to have to handle them all twice because most of them are on the ground. Fricking turkey. What an idiot. Goodness knows what's in there. Hope it's not fragile.'

It's unclear what is inside the fairly uniform boxes shown on the tape.

However, Bridgman notes in his YouTube commentary that on a previous occasion he witnessed Japanese sewing machines plastered with 'this way up' and 'fragile, handle with care' stickers being treated with the same respect.

Quick chat: The worker stops work to answer his cell phone

Mid air: The packages are thrown sky high and crash onto the tarmac

At one point, the handler answers his cell phone, but continues throwing the boxes towards the belt one-handed.

'This was amazing to watch. I think I was the only one noticing what was happening outside the window of the plane,' Bridgman wrote under the video, which has garnered more than 75,500 views.

'Lesson: Pack it well, because it wont be treated well.'

Looking at his handy work: The worker takes a break and views his strike rate

All done: Finally the trolley is empty, but only a handful of packages made it onto the conveyor belt

Most of the packages bounce off the conveyor belt and onto the tarmac, or miss the belt entirely
