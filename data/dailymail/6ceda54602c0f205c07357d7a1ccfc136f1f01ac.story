It may look like an aerial shot from a post-apocalyptic film, but this new map shows how London could look if sea levels continue to rise and the Thames Barrier wasn’t there to protect it.

Released by the Environment Agency, the map highlights what would happen if the capital was hit by 'severe' tidal surges.

Parts of Beckton, West Ham, Whitechapel and Southwark are all shown completely submerged with only a handful of spots across the floodplain escaping the flooding.

Melting ice from the poles could make sea levels rise by up to three 
feet by the end of the century, according to academics from the European Ice2sea 
programme, the British Antarctic Survey and Bristol University.

They claim there is a one in 20 chance that ocean levels around the 
British coast could be around a metre higher by 2100 as a result of 
climate change.

If such rises were to take place, London’s current sea defences would 
struggle to cope, with the capital at risk of flooding once a decade

Last week storms hit parts of the UK causing the largest tidal surges in 60 years. 

Around 1,400 homes were said to have been flooded, including 300 in worst-affected Lincolnshire.

However, many properties in London were protected due to the Thames Barrier - a 520m-long flood defence system near Woolwich in east London.

The movable barrier is made up of 10 gates attached to 39-metre tall cofferdam piles, which are buried 24 metres into the river bed.

Individual gates can be closed in ten minutes but the whole barrier takes an hour and half to close completely. 

The Thames Barrier, pictured, was opened in 1982 and is a 520m-long flood defence system near Woolwich in east London. Individual gates can be closed in ten minutes but the whole barrier takes an hour and half to close completely. The barrier can hold back up to 9,000 tonnes of water

In anticipation of last week’s storms, the Thames Barrier was closed on Thursday and Friday to prevent surges flooding the capital.

When fully raised, the barrier creates a solid steel wall preventing water flowing upstream towards the capital.

The four main gates span 61 metres and weigh over 3,300 tonnes each. Each gate is 20 metres high and can hold back loads of up to 9,000 tonnes. 

According to the Environment Agency, London is vulnerable to flooding and high tides from surges travelling down from the North Sea towards the English Channel and Thames Estuary.

In 1928 fourteen people were said to have died after flooding on the Thames, a further 307 died during the North Sea flood of 1953 and this led to the barrier being built in the late 70s before being opening in 1982.

It costs in excess of £16,000 each time to fully close the Thames Barrier but it is regularly tested and closed during high spring tides.

The Thames Barrier is the main defence against flooding for London and cover a 520 metre section of the River Thames near Woolwich.

The
 Thames Barrier has two types of gates: Falling Radial Gates that sit above the river and Rising 
Sector Gates which rest on the river bed.

Individual
 gates can be closed in ten minutes but the whole barrier takes around an house and a half to close completely. 

When fully raised, the barrier creates a solid steel wall that stops water flowing upstream towards the capital.

The four main gates span 61 metres and weigh over 3,300 tonnes each.

Each gate is 20 metres high and can hold around 9,000 tonnes of flowing water.

The Thames Barrier is only be reopened once the water level upstream of the barrier matches the level downstream.

Once a decision has been made to reopen it, a controlled amount of water is passed under the gate and up the Thames.
