Garden-visiting squirrels have been transformed into heroes of the animal kingdom after being unwittingly coaxed into human-like poses.

From popping a champagne cork to appearing to take part in magic tricks, the wild squirrels captured in these images are gently coaxed into their eccentric positions using a variety of toys and food treats.

Photographer Max Ellis, 51, says it takes hours - and occasionally days - to set up each shot, as he has to wait for his subjects to take up the exact stance in his garden in Teddington, south west London before he is able to capture his image.

Heavy lifting: This squirrel appears to be pumping iron, but is actually gathering sunflower seeds that have been strategically placed on a dumbbell suspended in the air using a fishing line.

Ouch! This inquisitive squirrel is sent flying through the air in fear by a game of Buckaroo. Mr Ellis, said the fact squirrels are really intelligent is both the biggest plus and minus to working with them

In one scene an inquisitive squirrel is sent flying through the air in fear by a game of Buckaroo, while in another it appears to be lifting weights.

Mr Ellis, who uses sunflower seeds, cookies and toys to lure the curious creatures into position, said: 'The fact they’re really intelligent is both the biggest plus and minus to working with them.

'They usually very quickly work out ways to get to the treats I leave for them but sometimes it takes a while as they’re wild animals so I need a lot of patience,' he added.

'I’m experimenting with more elaborate props and new ideas come to me daily. They constantly surprise me with their intelligence and dexterity so its great fun coming up with new ideas.

Talent: Mr Ellis said he came up with idea to crate hilarious photographs using wild squirrels after watching professional magicians with his 11-year-old son Guliver on YouTube last December

Inquisitive: Mr Ellis, who uses sunflower seeds, cookies and toys to lure the curious creatures into position, said: 'They usually very quickly work out ways to get to the treats I leave for them but sometimes it takes a while as they’re wild animals so I need a lot of patience'

Mr Ellis, 51, took the photographs after trying to work out new ways to entertain his 11-year-old son Gulliver.

He said he initially came up with idea for a squirrel magic show after watching professional magicians with Guliver on YouTube last December.

He said: 'My son is very keen on magic so I thought it might be fun to see if I could get the squirrels to perform a classic trick.'

'It did take quite a while to set up as I wanted it to look realistic. I thought The Great Squirrelisimo was a nice stage name.'

Calm: The inquisitive squirrel sneaks up behind the Buckaroo toy. Although he doesn't know it yet, the squirrel is in for quite a surprise

Fear: As the Buckaroo toy started to kick, the terrified squirrel jumped from the table to get away as quickly as it could. Mr Ellis said he uses very little retouching in the shots and the squirrels have never been harmed. 'They are probably better fed than any other wild squirrels on the planet,' he claimed

Flee: The squirrel seemed to want to get away from the toy as quickly as it could. Mr Ellis uses an incredibly fast shutter speed on his camera to catch the action

After the magic scene images started getting attention online, Mr Ellis decided to try to create a few more photographs using the squirrels.

'For the weightlifting shots I had a few weights lying around and wondered if the squirrels would check them out,' he said.

'I used some see-through wire so it looked extra natural and then it was just a matter of time waiting for one to get into the perfect position,' he added.

Mr Ellis said he uses very little retouching in the shots and the squirrels have never been harmed.

'They are probably better fed than any other wild squirrels on the planet,' he claimed.
