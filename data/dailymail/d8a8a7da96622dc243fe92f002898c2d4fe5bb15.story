You can't roll over on Twitter or Instagram without crashing into a 5:2 diet hashtag these days, with every man and his pet chinchilla eating whatever they like for five days a week and virtually starving themselves for two.

The intermittent fasting eating plan championed by doctors and Beyonce alike is hitting dinner tables around the world, with health experts and celebrities extolling the virtues of encouraging yourself to eat less by severely restricting the amount you can eat for just a couple days every week.

There is even evidence that fasting can improve cognitive function in humans and increase insulin sensitivity, hinting that it may guard 
against developing certain conditions such as dementia and diabetes.

But calorie-counting can get a little fiddly when you're down to just 500 a day (a generous 600 if you're a man), leaving you counting out rocket leaves on an electronic weighing scales like a mad scientist attempting to run a car on leafy salad.

I mean, how many big-Cs are there in a bunch of kale? What about the hefty wedge of fat in an avocado? And what's the deal with cottage cheese?

To help, weight-loss company LighterLife has launched a range of nutritionally-complete 5:2 fast day comestibles, available exclusively from high street chemist Superdrug in time for the post-Christmas gut-shrinking season on Boxing Day.

If you are doing the 5:2, try to make sure your fast day doesn't fall on 25 December...

The foods come in packs of four and are designed to ensure you receive all your needed nutrients on your fasting days.

Products include just-add-water shakes (vanilla, 
strawberry, banana, chocolate), porridge, vegetable soup and snack bars in nut fudge, peanut crunch, cranberry & 
raspberry and toffee.

Unforgettably, there are also powdered versions of popular 'normal' meals, including spaghetti bolognese and pasta carbonara.

Fast days have been shown to have greater health benefits than just weight loss

A LighterLife spokesman said: 'This new way of intermittent fasting is 
set to revolutionise the way we do the 5:2 and is designed to help 
people who are looking to lose weight or simply manage it.

'The products 
make it easy and effortless for people looking to achieve real results 
on 5:2.'

Robert Rona, Head of Programme at LighterLife said: 'We are thrilled to be working with Superdrug, and really look forward to seeing the Fastpacks on the shelves.

'LighterLife Fast is designed to make intermittent fasting a sustainable lifestyle option, and we are really excited to be able to have that made available to people on the high street.'

Dr Kelly Johnston, LighterLife Fast's scientist, said: 'Intermittent fasting gives your body some downtime from conventional food and also brings with it widely reported health benefits including increased life-span, improved cognitive function and protection against a number of conditions.

'However, fasting days can be very challenging and it can be tricky to get all the key nutrients your body needs when reducing your calorie intake.

'The new Lighterlife fast packs offer a very easy solution - they are nutritionally complete, offering a full quota of your daily vitamins and minerals, and can now we picked up at your local Superdrug, it really does all the hassle out of fasting, meaning you are reaping all the benefits, without much effort.'

Price packs start at £7.99 for the soup and rise to £8.49 for the shakes and pasta, and £8.99 for the bars and porridge.
