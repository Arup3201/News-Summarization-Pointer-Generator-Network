Two men have been jailed in a landmark drugs case after only being caught with caffeine and paracetamol.

Anthony Woodford, 23, and David Lewinson, 44, were jailed for eight years today in a landmark ruling after Lewinson was arrested at Dover docks in Kent.

He was found with 330lb (150kg) of the crushed substances, which investigators are convinced was intended to cut heroin, giving the pair a stash with a street value of more than £5million.

Woodford, of Harlow in Essex, was identified as the organiser of the cross-Channel trip, which led to what is believed to be a landmark prosecution.

The Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate launched an investigation and the pair were charged under the Serious 
Crime Act 2007 with importing 'a quantity of caffeine and paracetamol 
which was capable of encouraging or assisting... the supply of a 
controlled drug of Class A'.

A jury at Canterbury Court found Woodford and Lewinson, of Colindale, north
London, guilty of conspiracy to supply class A drugs last month.

Detective Sergeant Mat Scott, from the 
Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said after the sentencing: 'We believe this to be 
the first time in the UK that the prosecution were able to prove, beyond
doubt, that the huge quantity of paracetamol and caffeine were intended
to be used to cut with heroin.

Cutting agent: Lewinson was caught returned to Dover with 330lbs of crushed paracetamol and caffeine, blended together

Lucrative crime: Investigators believe the Class A drug would have had a street value of more than £5million after it had been cut

Crackdown: The pair were jailed for eight years at Canterbury Crown Court, in what was a landmark case because they were not caught with any illegal substances

'This has been a successful test case and therefore has set a precedent for this type of offence.

'The sentence given today will send a 
clear message to those involved in the importation and supply of drugs 
that we will relentlessly investigate when we feel that offences are 
being committed.'

Lewinson, the 'mule', drove a white Volkswagen Caddy 
van out of Dover's Eastern Docks and on to a Dunkirk-bound ferry on 
April 20 last year, police said.

He was stopped by border officials when he tried
to return a day later, and the blended powder was discovered. 
Both men were charged in February.
