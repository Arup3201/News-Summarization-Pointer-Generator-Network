The BBC's director of TV has admitted the corporation is facing growing competition from rivals both on screen and online, with the rise of streaming services such as Netflix 'blowing deals out of the water'.

Shows such as The Great British Bake Off and Strictly Come Dancing helped give the BBC some of the highest ratings on TV last year, with a 21.7 per cent share of audience viewing figures compared to ITV's 15.6 per cent.

However, despite the success, the BBC's director of TV said the broadcaster was facing stronger competition than ever, thanks to the likes of online platforms such as Netflix.

Danny Cohen (pictured), the BBC's director of TV, said the broadcaster was facing stronger competition than ever, thanks to the likes of online platforms such as Netflix, and said it meant the BBC faced 'hard choices'

He said Netflix had managed to offer 'five times' the amount of money for a deal than the BBC could and said it had 'blown us out of the water' in terms of the deal. Despite the rival, the BBC had high viewing figures for 2014

Danny Cohen, who is widely tipped as a future director general at the corporation, told the Financial Times: 'There's been a recent example where Netflix was able to blow us out of the water in terms of a deal.

'The sums offered by Netflix were five times what we could offer.'

Netflix, a U.S.-based network which provides TV shows and films via its online platform, has grown enormously over the last 12 months, with successes such as House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black.

Mr Cohen said  the rise of Netflix, and the additional investment in TV dramas by Sky and ITV, meant the licence-funded corporation faced 'hard choices'.

He said the BBC had to adjust to a 'hybrid world' of both live and online viewing.

He said: 'Television's not going away, channels are not going away for quite some time, but more people are going to watch online.'

In March, BBC director general Tony Hall announced plans to move channel BBC Three solely online.

The move would reportedly save the corporation tens of millions of pounds by slashing the youth-oriented station's budget and moving its shows to the iPlayer internet service.

The former controller of the channel, Zai Bennett, recently said the plan to close it was 'perverse', 'odd' and a 'massive strategic mistake'.

But, despite mounting opposition from presenters and some executives over recent months, the BBC's new chairman, Rona Fairhead, said the corporation should focus on putting even more shows on the internet.

So far this year, BBC One has accounted for 21.7 per cent of live television viewing in the UK, up 0.7 per cent from last year.

Meanwhile, ITV has accounted for 15.6 per cent, which is down 0.9 per cent on last year.

BBC shows such as The Great British Bake Off, the second most-watched show on TV last year – beaten only by an England World Cup match – and Strictly Come Dancing helped secure its rise in the TV ratings.

In contrast, the audience viewing figures released from the Broadcasters Audience Research Board (BARB), revealed that ITV's peak-time viewing fell eight per cent last year, despite shows such as X Factor, I'm a Celebrity and having the rights to this year's World Cup.  

So far this year, BBC One has accounted for 21.7 per cent of live television viewing in the UK, up 0.7 per cent on last year. In comparison, ITV has attracted a share of 5.6 per cent, which is down 0.9 per cent on last year
