Fernando Alonso  left hospital in Barcelona and returned to his family's home on Wednesday, three days after crashing in pre-season testing, McLaren confirmed.

Alonso was airlifted to hospital after his McLaren-Honda left the track and hit a wall side-on at turn three of the Circuit de Catalunya on Sunday.

The Spaniard remained conscious and able to speak to doctors after the incident, but he was concussed and airlifted to hospital for precautionary checks, including CT and MRI scans.

There were hopes that he could return to the McLaren car this weekend for the final winter testing in Barcelona, though the team have confirmed that reserve driver Kevin Magnussen will take his place.

A McLaren statement on Wednesday read: 'Following his testing accident at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya last Sunday, we are pleased to confirm that Fernando Alonso has now left hospital. He has returned to his family’s home in Spain for further rest and recuperation.

As a result, he will sit out this week’s final winter test, at which he was due to share driving duties with Jenson Button. Kevin Magnussen, McLaren-Honda’s test and reserve driver, will replace him.

Jenson will be testing the McLaren-Honda car tomorrow (February 26), and the team will confirm the full day-to-day running order in due course.

The McLaren driver was airlifted to hospital but was said to be 'OK and conscious'

McLaren have carried out tests on Alonso's car and insist the crash was not caused by mechanical failure.

'Our findings indicate that the accident was caused by the unpredictably gusty winds at that part of the circuit at that time, and which had affected other drivers similarly (eg, Carlos Sainz Jnr),' McLaren said.

'We can categorically state that there is no evidence that indicates that Fernando's car suffered mechanical failure of any kind.'

The incident occurred on the final day of the Formula One pre-season test, with the new campaign due to begin in Australia on March 15.

Alonso's manager Luis Garcia Abad told the Spanish media he 'doesn't think there will be any problems' with regard to the two-time world champion making the start line in Melbourne and he also denied reports that Alonso had been feeling dizzy prior to the crash.

'I deny that Fernando was feeling unwell prior to the incident,' he said. 'The car had grip, there was tremendous wind and he went into the wall, the rest is speculation.

'The car telemetry has stated that he was correcting from left to right.

'Fernando was hitting the brake and changing gears until the moment of impact.'

Alonso, who has 32 career grand prix victories, rejoined McLaren this season after a disappointing fifth and final campaign with Ferrari.

He won back-to-back world titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006 before spending one season at McLaren in 2007.
