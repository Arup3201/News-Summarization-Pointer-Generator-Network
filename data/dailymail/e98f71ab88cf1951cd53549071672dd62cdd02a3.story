Most infections are caused by bacteria on the patient's skin entering the surgical wound

Scientists in the U.S. have devised an implant in a tiny silk 'purse' that kills infections after surgery and then dissolves in the body.

Up to four in 100 people undergoing surgery in the UK will develop an infection, and this can prolong hospital stays by as much as nine days.

Surgical wound infections are the leading cause of hospital readmissions after operations, according to a study published last month.

Most infections are caused by bacteria on the patient's skin entering the surgical wound.

The most common culprits are Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, responsible for 20 per cent of surgical site infections, coagulase negative staphylococcus, and enterococcus bacteria.

The infection can usually be treated with antibiotics but sometimes patients need more complex treatment, including further surgery.

The new implant uses heat to kill off bacteria. It consists of a tiny, magnesium coil wrapped in a pocket of silk protein, and is implanted during surgery - if the patient later shows sign of infection, the implant can be switched on using a remote control. This raises the temperature of the coil.

The silk protein protects the coil - both harmlessly dissolve in the body over the next fortnight.

This is an improvement on previous medical implant devices, which are made from non-degradable materials that need to be removed.

Researchers at Tufts University have used the implant in mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus, raising its temperature for two periods of ten minutes.

Within 24 hours the tissue was infection-free. The device, including the coil, completely dissolved after 15 days.

'This is an important step forward for the development of on-demand medical devices that can be turned on remotely,' the researchers said. 'These wireless strategies could help manage post-surgical infection, for example, or pave the way for eventual "wi-fi" drug delivery.'

The team has also carried out experiments using remote control to deliver antibiotics to treat E.coli and Staphylococcus aureus.

Stella Vig, consultant vascular and general surgeon at Croydon University Hospital, said: 'This is an exciting new concept and an innovative tool against the war of surgical site infection.

This new purse could allow a reduction of bacterial load with an implantable device

The concept of reducing bacterium within the tissues and thereby reducing risk of infections is not new, and was previously achieved by deploying antibiotic beads within the tissues. These required retrieval and therefore are not used routinely.

'This new device would allow a reduction of bacterial load with an implantable device, which then disappears without the need for surgery to remove it.

'Surgical site infections are costly as they increase the length of stay for patients and can lead to further surgery.'

Meanwhile, a team at the University of South Florida has developed a new antibiotic to fight the superbug methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA, which kills thousands of people worldwide each year. The bug is a form of Staphylococcus aureus which does not respond to the usual antibiotics.

The new treatment is based on a class of drugs called quinazolines, which have been used in treating malaria and cancer. They have recently been shown to act on bacteria, too.

'In recent years, MRSA has become resistant to vancomycin, our most valuable treatment option against staphylococcal infections,' said Dr Lindsey N. Shaw, whose team developed the new drugs.

'Bacterial disease remains the second-leading cause of death globally, especially among children and the elderly.

'We need new drugs to fight these infections.'
