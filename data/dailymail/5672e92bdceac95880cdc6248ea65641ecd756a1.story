Older people are uncomfortable about homosexuality, Nigel Farage claimed yesterday.

The UK Independence Party leader said most people aged over 70 are not comfortable about gay people or equal rights.

He said many are disconcerted by the introduction of gay marriage.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the over-70s are uncomfortable with homosexuality

And he risked an electoral backlash 
by defending Ukip’s Newark  by-election candidate Roger Helmer, who has 
described homosexuality as abnormal and undesirable. Mr Farage said: ‘If
 we asked the 70s and over in this country how they felt about it 
[homosexuality], most of them still feel uncomfortable.’

His intervention came as a poll 
suggested controversy about Ukip’s candidates may be denting the party’s
 popularity in the run-up to next week’s European Parliament elections.

An exclusive Opinium poll for the 
Daily Mail reveals that Ukip and Labour are now almost neck and neck in 
the race to top the poll on May 22.

The survey of voting intentions for 
the European elections puts Ukip on 28 per cent, Labour on 27, the 
Conservatives on 23 and the Liberal Democrats on just  8 per cent. 
Ukip’s one-point lead is its lowest this month.

Mr Helmer, 70, is standing for Ukip 
in next month’s poll in Newark, Nottinghamshire, which was forced by the
 resignation of shamed Tory MP Patrick Mercer.

Roger Helmer has rarely avoided controversy during his career as an MEP, but has been returned to Brussels three times and is now the party's candidate in the Newark by-election

The Ukip candidate is a serving MEP 
and is also standing for the European Parliament again next week. But 
his outspoken views on homosexuality have sparked controversy. He has 
previously said homosexuality is ‘not a lifestyle worthy of valid equal 
respect’, but now claims that his views have changed.

Mr Farage told the BBC’s Sunday 
Politics show yesterday that Mr Helmer ‘grew up with a strong Christian 
Bible background – he grew up in an age when homosexuality was actually 
imprisonable’. He said Mr Helmer was a good candidate who had made his 
most outspoken comments on homosexuality while he was a Conservative 
MEP.

He added: ‘When Roger grew up and, 
indeed, when he was an adult, homosexuality was illegal in this country,
 and he held that view for some period of time.

The Ukip leader was challenged over remarks by prominent MEP Roger Helmer who once said he some people find gay people ¿distasteful if not viscerally repugnant¿

Mr Farage, who was egged on a visit to Nottingham, complained about having to have security to deal with protests

‘And actually, if we asked the 70s and over in this country how they felt about it, most of them still feel uncomfortable.

‘He has said the world has moved on, 
he now accepts there’s been a big social change in Britain. There are a 
lot of people in this country who are disconcerted by the change in the 
traditional meaning of marriage, and  I think in a tolerant society we 
understand that some people have different views.’

Ukip has faced a deluge of bad publicity about comments made by some of its candidates and leading supporters.

Demetri Marchessini, Ukip’s sixth 
biggest donor, claimed last month that gay people are incapable of love 
and said it was impossible for a man to rape his wife. Harry Perry, a 
Ukip council candidate in Stockport, was suspended from the party 
earlier this month for branding David Cameron a ‘gay-loving nutcase’.

The party has also been forced to discipline a number of candidates for racist remarks.

Nigel Farage claims he has been forced to hire bodyguards due to the threat of violence from anti-fascist organisations.

The Ukip leader said yesterday that members of the groups Unite Against Fascism and Hope Not Hate have been violently protesting at his public meetings.

He said: ‘I’m perfectly happy for them to come to my meetings  and have an argument with me, but it’s not so much fun when they are banging me over the head with banners.’

Both groups denied Mr Farage’s accusations.
