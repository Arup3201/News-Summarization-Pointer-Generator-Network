Ulrika Jonsson has spoken out after Sven Goran Eriksson confirmed their affair in his autobiography

Making love with Sven-Goran Eriksson was as dull as putting together Ikea flat-pack furniture, TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson claimed yesterday.

Miss Jonsson, 46, said the former England manager was: ‘Devoid of passion. He had all this power and money yet he was the weakest man I have ever met.

‘Sex with Sven was as ordered and functional as an Ikea instruction manual. Putting together a Billy bookcase would have probably left me more satisfied.’

Miss Jonsson said her fellow Swede loved to ‘talk dirty’ in broken English when they were in bed together.

‘It was strange, she said. ‘He didn’t speak English well at all so we always spoke Swedish to each other.

'But when we were in the bedroom he always talked dirty in this singy-songy broken English. I tried to ignore it.

‘It would have been better if he hadn’t spoken at all. I had to do all the work and the sex was always over very quickly.’

Miss Jonsson said Eriksson lived in fear of his ‘feisty fruitcake’ girlfriend Nancy Dell’olio who slapped him when their four-month secret affair was exposed.

But she claimed the Italian should be grateful for the scandal because it made her famous.

Speaking in response to Mr Eriksson’s tell-all book, serialised in the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, Miss Jonsson said: ‘From what he told me, Nancy was handy with her fists.

'There was one time after our relationship became public that he had a cut on his nose and he told people he had tripped on some stairs.

‘I asked him on the phone if he was OK when Nancy found out and he replied: “Well I’m still alive.” She was aggressive with him and he told me that many times.’

Miss Jonsson said Eriksson, 65, and Miss Dell’Olio, 52, were not suited.

She said in an interview with The Sun: ‘Sven studied philosophy, he is a calm and logical man. She is a fiesty fruitcake.

'She was with him for money and he was with her because he was scared of what she’d do if he wasn’t.

Mr
Goran Eriksson said that that his then girlfriend Nancy Dell'Olio 
regarded Miss Jonsson as 'little more than a prostitute' in an extract 
from his book serialised by the Daily Mail this week

‘When I asked him why he didn’t leave her he said it would cost him too much. But I could tell it was more that he was scared of her.’

Miss Jonsson’s affair with Eriksson  began in January 2002 a month after they first met at a party.

She said: ‘I never took a penny from Sven during our time together — I even insisted on buying my own plane ticket when we went to Portugal together. Yet Nancy has accepted money from Sven throughout their entire relationship.

‘She should be thanking me. Before news of our affair broke she was just the Italian girlfriend of Sven.

Mr Goran Eriksson and Miss Dell'Olio stayed together after the revelations but separated in 2006

‘When it hit the headlines, Nancy was suddenly famous. And she used that to her advantage. She’d have never been on Strictly Come Dancing if it wasn’t for me.’

Eriksson acknowledged his affair with Miss Jonsson for the first time in our excerpts from his autobiography.

He revealed that it started when they met for the second time at a function in Manchester.

He wrote: ‘I was there with some people from the FA. For some reason, Ulrika was also invited. We met at the hotel the evening before and ended up spending the night together.

‘After that, Ulrika and I met when we could. Not daily, but now and then. It got to be more and more serious.

‘Nancy did not suspect anything. She was travelling to Italy a lot during that time. Once, Ulrika and I went to Portugal for a few days. Mostly we met at her house outside London.’

He said Miss Dell’Olio was livid when she found out about the secret relationship when it was revealed by a Sunday newspaper.

‘To Nancy, Ulrika was little more than a prostitute who was not worthy of being on the same planet as Miss Dell’Olio,’ he wrote.

‘Nancy’s mother called from Italy. She had read the story online — Italy was an hour ahead of England.

‘Nancy was livid, she said: “Was it true?” I said it was nothing to worry or get upset about, or something to that effect.’

Mr Eriksson, now a football coach in China, said he did not feel he had anything to apologise for and claimed he received a positive reaction from the public.

‘I got a lot of “thumbs up” from young men who laughed and said they wished it had been them getting together with a beautiful woman like Ulrika.'
