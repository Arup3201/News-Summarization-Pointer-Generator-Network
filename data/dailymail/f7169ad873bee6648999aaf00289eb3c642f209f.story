A sneering sex attacker found guilty 
of a string of brutal rapes has been handed his fifth life sentence – 
but told he could be back on the streets in little more than four years.

Stephen Crawford - branded a 
‘dangerous’ predator ‘who enjoys the act of rape’ - was today given a 
life sentence for raping a 13-year-old schoolgirl thirty years ago.

He had already been serving four life 
terms following his conviction in 2007 for a series of sex attacks including raping three women between 2005 and 2006.

Predator: Judge John Milford QC, left, told Stephen Crawford, right, that he 'enjoys the act of rape' before imposing a life sentence which could be as short as four and a half years at Newcastle Crown Court

And it emerged after the latest trail 
at Newcastle Crown Court, that Crawford had previously been cleared on 
five separate occasions of raping women over two decades.

He was found not guilty of rape during
the 1980s and 90s – managing to convince the jury in each trial the 
alleged victim had consented to sex – but picked up a string of 
convictions for unlawful sex with teenage victims and sexual assault.

But despite his horrific past, Judge 
John Milford imposed a life sentence which has a four-and-a-half year 
minimum tariff, meaning he will be eligible for release as early as 
2016.

Judge Milford told him: ‘I am satisfied you are dangerous, you are a man who enjoys the act of rape.

‘Nobody knows when you will cease to be a danger to woman so the only sentence I can pass upon you is life. You will only be released when the parole board is satisfied you are safe to release.’

Crawford was working as a mobile disc jockey when he targeted the young girl as she walked home alone in the early 1980s.

The now 49-year-old, from Washington, 
Tyne and Wear, had once again denied his guilt but jurors convicted him 
of rape after just 90 minutes deliberation.

The victim had told the court of the look of ‘sheer power’ on Crawford’s face when he attacked her all those years ago.

It was only when the woman could not 
cope with keeping her ordeal secret, after three painful decades, she 
reported what had happened to her.

Horrific past: Jurors heard some details of Crawford's long history of brutal and predatory attacks on young girls and women over several decade during his trial at Newcastle Crown Court

Judge Milford added: ‘She was so 
frightened by the experience she did not think anyone would believe her 
over your inevitable denials and she kept the matter to herself for all 
those years.

‘It is clear to me that this offence has had an immense impact upon her, that it has lived with her throughout her adult years.

‘One only had to see her demeanour in the witness box to appreciate that.’

Five separate women in the 1980s and 1990s found the rape accusations they made against Crawford come to nothing.

In 1985, Crawford was accused of 
raping a 15-year-old girl in Washington. He admitted unlawful sex and 
the rape charge was dropped.

In June 1992 he was found not guilty 
by a jury of raping an 18-year-old girl he had offered a lift in his 
caravette after insisting she consented.

At the same time another charge of rape against a different woman was dropped after prosecutors offered no evidence.

In September 1992 he was cleared by a jury of raping a woman in his car after offering her a lift home.

Again, he claimed the 18-year-old consented. And in March 1993 a rape charge made 
by an off-duty special constable was dropped when she backed out of 
giving evidence against him.

The jury in the 2007 case were never 
told of Crawford’s chilling background which included; a conviction for 
sex with a girl under 16, 21 months in jail for unlawful sex with a 
13-year-old.

Or that in April 1999 he got a 
suspended sentence after he attacked a 15-year-old girl in the cab of 
his car transporter after driving her to a secluded lane in Gateshead.

Attacks: The jury were told how Crawford would pretend to be a taxi and target lone women including one victim who became separated from friends after a night out in Durham

Or that he has been convicted of failing to comply with the requirements of the sex offenders register twice.

During the 2007 trial three victims – none of whom knew each other - gave evidence one after another before the same jury.

The court heard how Crawford stalked 
the streets posing at a taxi driver looking for lone females to pick up 
and attack in Durham and Sunderland.

He offered lifts to the three women 
who had become separated from friends during nights out. One of his 
victims was subjected to a five hour ordeal.

Another victim, a 17-year-old, told 
jurors she had resorted to showing Crawford pictures of her family on 
her mobile phone and begging him to look at their faces to imagine how 
they would suffer if he killed her.

One of the victims, who faced Crawford while 
giving evidence from the witness box, told jurors: ‘I’ve never, ever in 
my life hated anyone as much as I hate that bloke.

‘It has got to the stage where I’ve had nightmares about it, I can’t stop thinking about it.

‘For someone to have such an impact on somebody else’s life like this, even after this many years, its just wrong.’

Crawford admitted he offered lifts to the women but said they consented to any sexual activity which took place.

He claimed to the jurors that the women seemed to ‘enjoy’ what happened and insisted they consented to sex.

But after hearing evidence from his sobbing victims, jurors found him guilty.

During his defence, Crawford claimed the victim was a ‘total stranger’ to him and denied having any sexual contact with her.

Crawford told jurors: ‘They were total
strangers to me yesterday, both people who stood in this dock, I have 
never seen them before in my life.’

When asked if the victim’s name meant 
anything to him, Crawford replied: ‘It didn’t then, it doesn’t now, it 
means nothing, no idea.’

Andrew Walker, defending, said 
Crawford has now admitted the past offending he was convicted of, 
despite his denials at the time.

He maintains his denials in relation 
to his conviction this week. Mr Walker said Crawford is co-operating 
with officials and undergoing programmes in jail.

Mr Walker added; ‘He is in extremely poor health, he informs me he has had 16 heart attacks since his remand in custody in 2007.

‘His cardiologist is extremely pessimistic about his life expectancy.’
