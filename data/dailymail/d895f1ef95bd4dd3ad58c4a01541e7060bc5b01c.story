Homeless anti-war protester Stephen Bicker, 47, (pictured) has apologised  for vandalising two war memorials - spraying one on Remembrance Day

A homeless anti-war protester who vandalised a war memorial on Remembrance Day and another a few days later has said sorry for his 'misguided' protest.

Stephen Bicker, 47, of no fixed abode, sprayed 'Sold Ya' on a monument to the Royal East Kent Regiment in Dane John Gardens in Canterbury, Kent on November 11.

Officers from Kent Police were called following reports that the war memorial had been spray-painted sometime between 6pm on Saturday November 8 and 8am on Sunday November 9. 

Bicker was arrested at the time but was released on bail - and two days later he repeated the offence on another memorial in nearby Faversham. 

Bicker had vandalised the monument shortly before a Remembrance memorial service was about to begin.

An elderly lady was forced to try to wipe the graffiti off with her handkerchief before council contractors were called in to clean up the damage.  

Bicker admitted two counts of criminal damage in Medway Magistrates Court yesterday and described himself as an 'anti-war protester'.

He told magistrates in Canterbury: 'I deeply regret offending people, it's not what I wanted.

'I do not believe in armed conflict and I had to get that message across.

'But I realise on reflection that targeting the monument was not the way to go. 

'I am sorry for that.'

Bicker was given a six-month community order with supervision and alcohol treatment programmes.

He was also ordered to pay £180 for each memorial he damaged plus £85 costs.
