An student's rubber band ball started making a ball of rubber bands in class - and 65,000 bands later, it had stretched into the world's bounciest office chair.

Industrial Design student Preston Moeller, 26, spent 336 hours designing and building the 3ft tall chair.

It weighs 35lb and can support the weight of a grown adult.

It took 65,000 rubber bands and 336 hours of work to make the colourful chair

His colourful creation earned him the $3,000 first prize in the Appalachian State University’s 6th Annual Chair Design Competition

Mr Moeller, from Cleveland, North Carolina, constructed the chair by wrapped rubber bands around a wire frame, hidden from view.

On his personal website, he reported that the chair was proving to be incredibly hardy.

He wrote: 'It has been moved around to multiple shows and I have been using it for the last couple months as my computer chair and it still looks as good as new.

'On the other hand, I have other smaller pieces that have started to dry up after around four years so I'm not sure how long the chair has to live.

'It looks as if the frame under the rubber bands is helping to keep them fresh but I don’t expect it to last forever.'

The chair was even shown off during New York Design Week as part of the Industrial Designers Society of America’s booth.

Preston Moeller, 26, has put the rubber band ball to a more unconventional use - as an office chair, modelled by former Appalachian State classmate Maegen Eichinger

The chair, with a wire frame hidden beneath the rubber bands, stands three feet tall and weighs 35lbs
