Shirley Player, 61, stole £57,000 a year from 2007 to 2014

When Shirley Player was diagnosed with cancer, she decided she had nothing to lose.

Facing debts, and assuming she would be dead before anyone found out, she stole £400,000 from her employers.

But fate did not deal her the hand she had accepted. Doctors gave her the cancer all-clear...and police charged her with theft.

While the 61-year-old accounts manager has escaped her death sentence, she is now beginning a four year jail sentence.

‘She had not expected to be still here,’ prosecutor Carolyn Branford-Wood told Bournemouth Crown Court.

The extent of the married grandmother’s thieving came to light when her employers, an estate agency, carried out an audit earlier this year. They discovered Player had transferred a total of £390,550 into her personal bank accounts over seven years, concealing the payments as tenant deposit returns.

She made 390 transactions into four accounts, and then covered up the payments by editing the company’s accounts system to make them look legitimate.

Mrs Branford-Wood said Player, from Bournemouth, used the money to settle debts, pay rents and on ‘family treats’.

She said: ‘She had thought she might have died before the thefts were discovered.

‘She lost both her sisters to cancer in the mid-2000s and she had then been diagnosed but responded favourably to treatment.’

The court heard how Player confessed her crimes to police immediately. Mrs Branford-Wood said Player – who turned up to court smoking a cigarette – told officers: ‘It started because I had debts and then I thought, “I’m getting away with it” and it just escalated. In the end I could not stop.’

The prosecutor said: ‘Asked where the money had gone, she said it was on bills, rent and treats for the family. There was no property purchase and no expensive new car.’

Player worked at Allan and Bath estate agents, which was bought by Leaders in 2006, for 14 years, starting off as an accounts assistant but eventually becoming accounts manager.

In mitigation, Brian Sharman, said his client had lost one sister to cancer in 2006 and another in 2008. Although she didn’t have the disease when she began the theft, Player was convinced it was just a matter of time before she would be diagnosed, and she was in 2010.

The accounts manager claims she stole the money because her two sisters had previously died from breast cancer. Bournemouth Crown Court heard she had thought she would 'not be here' when her employers uncovered what she had been doing

Mr Sharman added: ‘She thought she would be dead before they found out.’

Sentencing Player, Judge John Harrow said: ‘You stole a colossal amount of money.’ He said her gross abuse of trust meant that imprisonment was unavoidable.

Player, who lives in a £250,000 semi-detached house in Bournemouth, was given the all-clear about six months ago after radiotherapy. Her retired husband Malcolm said he had no idea about his wife’s crime spree until the police investigation.

He added: ‘We weren’t driving around in Bentleys and drinking champagne. We might have gone out for the odd steak dinner.’
