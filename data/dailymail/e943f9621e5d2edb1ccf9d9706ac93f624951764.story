There is always a group of children waiting to hand the Queen the customary posy of flowers when she walks out of morning service.

But yesterday Prince Philip was also given his own treat when the couple emerged from a church in West Newton, Norfolk.

As Her Majesty smiled as she looked on, the Duke of Edinburgh appeared equally delighted to receive a bag of sweets from a young well-wisher outside the church in the heart of the Sandringham Estate.

Sweet treat: Prince Philip was given a bag of Morrisons chocolate éclairs by a young girl, left, after attending a church service in West Newton, Norfolk

Inedible gifts: As has become tradition, the Queen accepted bouquets of flowers from waiting children

The sweets - an 89p bag of own-brand chocolate éclairs from Morrisons - were later spotted on the Prince's lap as he was driven away.

Parents crowded round with camera phones to capture the moment as their sons and daughters bravely stepped forward to meet the monarch - while some hung shyly back.

The bouquets are often tactfully placed in a separate car by one of the Queen's security team.

But the éclairs seemed to find a special place in the Prince's heart, and was spotted still on his lap as the Royal car pulled away.

The Royal pair had attended a service at the Church of St Peter and Paul, which is on the Sandringham estate.

Happy and glorious: The Queen beamed as excited parents and children crowded round in the sunshine

Spectators: During the service, the Queen and Prince saw a Biblical play performed by Sunday school children

According to local media, the Queen and Philip had just enjoyed a performance of a Biblical play - Whither Thou Go'est - performed by children at the church's Sunday School.

The monarch often accepts flowers after morning service when she is staying at Sandringham, although in recent weeks the practice has become a little haphazard.

Last week the Queen dashed straight to her waiting car because of heavy rain, following successive Sundays in which she has accepted bouquets of flowers.

She had refused to accept flowers from children for two Sundays over Christmas and New Year, reportedly because she had to collect so many on Christmas Day she was late for lunch.
