Payout: Serial rapist and killer David Mulcahy has won £515 for a damaged package sent from his cell where he is serving three life sentences

A sex killer who psyched himself up for rape and murder by listening to Michael Jackson’s Thriller has won £515 compensation - for a damaged parcel sent from jail.

The taxpayer-funded payout for David Mulcahy has sparked outrage among victims' groups and MPs as he serves three life sentences.

Mulcahy, 55, was jailed in 2001 and ordered to serve a minimum of 30 years for his four-year rape and murder spree with school friend John Duffy in the 1980s.

The pair played Michael Jackson before their attacks and targeted victims around railway tracks, earning them the names Thriller Killers and Railway Rapists.

But the convict has boasted to friends after winning hundreds of pounds in compensation from the Prison Service.

In a letter from his cell at maximum-security Full Sutton prison, near York, Mulcahy said: 'My package was destroyed.

'The judge ruled that the prison had lied and they were totally responsible for any damage. I won £515.'

After bragging about his payout, he wrote: 'Be warned, if you sue and win, there will be consequences and reprisals.'

Mulcahy claims prison bosses now won’t let him send any post.

This includes posting a model made for the Koestler Trust prison art awards, in which the prize for the winning prisoner is £100 and a certificate.

In his rant at his prison bosses, he writes: 'They are now also refusing to answer my applications or request/complaint forms on this matter.'

News of the compensation sparked fury, with critics saying it makes a mockery of British justice.

It also sparked calls for the UK Government to end ridiculous claims by prisoners.

Tory MP Philip Davies said: 'The fact that murderers and rapists such as Mr Mulcahy can be compensated for a damaged parcel goes to show how perverse our legal system has become.

'The only reason he is in prison is 
because of his vile crimes, and for him to be able to pursue this claim 
from his cell is utterly ridiculous.

'The compensation should be stripped
 from him to benefit the families of his victims.'

Married father-of-four Mulcahy and Duffy went on what they called 'hunting parties' searching for lone women to rape and murder.

Both martial arts enthusiasts, they often ambushed victims, binding, gagging and blindfolding them.

They tossed a coin to decide who should be first to rape before murdering them.

For years, Mulcahy, from Chalk Farm, north London, thought he had got away with it.

But justice caught up with him.

Duffy, sentenced to 30 years in 1988 for two killings and a rape, named his accomplice to a psychiatrist and gave evidence against his old school pal.

At the Old Bailey in 2001, Mulcahy was given three life sentences for the murders of Alison Day, 19, Dutch schoolgirl Maartje Tamboezer 15, and newlywed Anne Lock, 29.

He was also convicted of seven rapes and five conspiracies to rape.

Each rape carried a sentence of 24 years, while each conspiracy came with an 18-year term.

Because of the horrific nature of the 
crimes, Judge Michael Hyam ruled that Mulcahy had to serve at least 30 
years before he could even be considered for parole.

The judge told him: 'These were acts of wickedness in which you descended to the depths of depravity.'

In April, justice secretary Chris 
Grayling ordered an urgent review into compensation claims by prisoners 
after it emerged triple murderer Kevan Thakrar was paid 
for damaged nail clippers.

A Prison Service spokesman said: 'We defended this claim and are disappointed with the judge’s decision.

'The Government has no intention of paying compensation to prisoners when there is no good reason to do so and robustly defends all cases, as far as the evidence allows.

'The Justice Secretary has ordered a review of the system to ensure taxpayers’ money does not go to those who shouldn’t get it.'

David Mulcahy and John Duffy were described chillingly as 'two bodies with one brain' for the way they hunted for women to rape and murder.

Mulcahy and Duffy were drawn together as a pair of 11-year-olds on their first day of school in 1970.

They were bullied at school and built an alliance, becoming obsessed with martial arts.

Alison Day (left), 19, was visiting her fiancé when they pulled her off Hackney Wick platform, raped her twice, and strangled her with her blouse. Maartje Tamboezer (right), 15, was raped, killed and badly burned by the pair. She was cycling home from school in Horsley, Surrey, when they tripped up her bike with a fishing line

Just two years later, Mulcahy was suspended from Haverstock Hill Comprehensive, in Chalk Farm, north London, after killing a hedgehog by stamping on its head.

Duffy stood by laughing.

As they grew older, their larks became much more sinister.

They planned and executed their murders together, down to the tissues Duffy carried in a matchbox to wipe away and burn forensic evidence.

They went on what they called 'hunting parties' cruising along singing to Michael Jackson's hit song Thriller as they searched for lone women to rape and murder.

Going out at night and weekends in search of prey, they would prolong their excitement by comparing victims after each attack.

They tossed a coin to decide who should be first to rape before murdering them.

For their first attack, they had 
planned a kidnap using false names and accents, kitting themselves out 
with balaclavas, sticky tape and knives.

It didn’t work because the pair became 'nervous', Duffy later said.

Nevertheless, they had snatched a young woman off the street in the early hours and raped her in turn behind a wall.

Then,
 over the next four years, they embarked on a campaign that would claim 
them a joint place in the criminal record books as history’s most 
prolific rapists.

Despite their silence pact, John Duffy gave evidence against Mulcahy when he was sentenced to 30 years for his crimes.

At the Old Bailey in 2001, Mulcahy was
 given three life sentences for the murders of Alison Day, 19, Dutch 
schoolgirl Maartje Tamboezer 15, and newlywed Anne Lock, 29.

He was also convicted of seven rapes and five conspiracies to rape.
