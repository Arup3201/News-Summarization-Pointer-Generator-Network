The honeymoon. It happens once (you hope). The holiday to beat all others. Naturally, I left my fiancé, Charlie, to take the honeymoon helm. He was sailing solo.

And it wasn't until we arrived at Heathrow that the itinerary of a Kenyan safari and Zanzibar was revealed. What a man. What a husband!

Sipping champagne on the deck of our tent at Ol Seki, transfixed by a giraffe gliding across the waves of red, green and ochre plain below, the months of nagging Charlie about booking vaccinations and checking luggage were almost forgotten.

A job well done, sir: Kate with her new husband and travel planner extraordinaire, Charlie

A note to grooms-to-be: a weight allowance and 'beach clothes plus a cover-up' is not sufficient packing guidance for even the most low-maintenance fiancée.

Nor, as it turned out, was it accurate for a safari. The savannah gets cold. But despite being dressed in almost every item in my 15kg bag the next morning, I still couldn't do anything but grin.

It was all too perfect.

Ol Seki is a beautiful ten-tent camp on the 200 sq km Naboisho Conservancy, bordering the Masai Mara National Park.

Land is rented from the local Masai, creating a partnership between traditions and tourism. Ol Seki is fully involved in local life - from dispatching the tractor to help nearby villages to supporting the Koiyaki Guiding School, which trains Masai and counted our guide Raphael among its alumni.

Our first game drive was stupendous.

My heart thudded as a male lion strutted a metre from us. It was quiet, save for the click of my camera as an elephant padded silently, with a grace unbefitting his size.

And we were so absorbed watching the red sun rise over the hills and spill its fiery morning light across the plains that the camera didn't even get a look in.

We were there for the great migration, voted by USA Today as one of the New Seven Wonders Of The World. Around July and August, conveniently timed for summer honeymoons, 1.5million wildebeest, 350,000 Thomson's gazelles and 200,000 zebras cross the Mara River from the Serengeti into Kenya. It's rush hour on the savannah.

Our final evening's drive (night drives are banned in the Mara and you have to keep to the tracks) finished with a surprise dinner on a rocky promontory in the middle of the wilderness.

A little patch of paradise: Zanzibar is blessed with white-sand beaches and splendid hotels

Camp fire at our feet, gin to our lips and a blanket of stars over our heads, we were sold on safaris.

Then we left Ol Seki and headed to its equally attractive sister hotel in Nairobi.

Opened last year, Hemingways Nairobi offers the perfect rest after bone-rattling dawn drives. You can even check in for just the afternoon between flights to stretch your legs on the manicured lawns, take a massage or do laps of the pool.

Rested and ready for our next adventure, we caught a flight from Nairobi to Zanzibar. This exotic island has been attracting visitors for centuries.

Arab merchants, European explorers and Indian tradesmen were brought by monsoon winds, seduced by spices, bazaars, or, shamefully, the slave trade.

This painful memory is addressed at the Anglican Cathedral in Stone Town. Built on the site of the old slave market, the altar poignantly stands where once was the whipping post.

An hour's drive from Stone Town, on the east coast is the six-villa Palms hotel, part of the Zanzibar Collection. Everything is beautiful, from the hand-carved woodwork and culinary masterpieces leaving the kitchen, to the staff 's welcoming smiles and views across the Indian Ocean, which changes colour with every sip of your sundowner.

Even we - cynics of anything involving hearts and rose petals - couldn't help being swept up by how romantic the resort is. By the end of the first day we were strolling on the beach hand in hand, drunk on the cornflour soft sand and electric sea.

We were helped by the charming manager Siriak. He took joy in finding every opportunity to surprise us, from surreptitiously running a candle-lit bath to secretly setting up our lunch under a palm canopy on the beach.

Honeymoon cliche we may have become, but deserted beaches these are not. This island paradise comes with a backbone and life zinging through the sand.

Our beach lunch was happily disturbed by migrating cattle and fishermen cycling past. At low tide, we walked out to the reef, passing locals searching the bath-warm water for sea snails.

Roar power: Kate and Charlie spent happy days amid the wildlife of Kenya's Masai Mara

Further down the beach is the village of Bwejuu, where the hotel group has built a maternity clinic and a mosque for the locals.

The sand here is covered with half-buried tyres. Not litter, but each one marking where a coconut has been buried to soften and make into rope.

Family-run, the Zanzibar Collection has three, soon to be four, exquisite properties along the same stretch of coast.

The location was chosen by the owner's father, based on an old British map showing a well. It was never found, but this didn't stop the family from forging ahead.

Its other hotels, Breezes and Baraza, sit next door to Palms, and each reflects a different part of Zanzibar's history. Palms is inspired by the Swahili heritage; Breezes has a European feel; while the 30-villa Baraza, with its huge pool and serene courtyards, nods to the Arabian past.

Palms guests can enjoy the sister hotels, too. Breezes has a diving school and offers private dinners fit for sultans.

When we decided to prepare ourselves for the return to a life less horizontal, we joined a snorkelling safari and worked off lunch at Baraza's tennis courts.

Charlie had done well, seriously well. I'm normally in charge of travel arrangements, but on our return I made a decision. I gave him the travel trousers - for him to have and to hold, from this day forward, till death us do part.
