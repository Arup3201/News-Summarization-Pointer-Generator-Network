Schoolgirl sex gangs in China are being hired to blackmail youngster classmates into selling their virginities to government officials, it has been reported.

Tycoons are increasingly striking deals to arrange sexual favours for corrupt Party bosses in the country, it has been claimed.

In one case, a ‘tribunal’ of adolescent girls at a school in the Shanxi province ordered younger victims to strip and hit each other while their clothes were sliced off with blades, according to reports.

A separate case in Henan saw dozens of schoolgirls pictured naked at a nightclub with the images used to force sex with local officials and as a way of bringing in fresh recruits.

Chinese media outlets claim that in many cases powerful individuals are organising the criminal activity in a bid to win business opportunities.

According to Globalpost, claims of schoolgirls being sexually exploited in this way have become ‘shockingly common’.

It reports that victims are often taken to karaoke bars or hotels by older girls who are already linked to tycoons.

Late last year, the website says, it was reported that investigations had started into a ring involving ‘dozens’ of schoolgirls in Yunnan ‘given as gifts for leaders outside the county to use’.

Girls were said to have been bribed by a female intermediary before being plied with booze. Some victims later claimed they had been drugged and raped.

In the Hainan province, the head teacher at one school was accused of being involved in a ‘drug induced session’ with six students and a local official, Globalpost reports.

And up to 50 youngsters were targeted in a separate case in Yunnan’s capital Kunming.

Arrests are since said to have been made in the Henan case but question marks surround the convictions amid reports a number of junior officials involved only received suspended sentences.

Parents of victims in the Shanxi case claimed abusers had threatened to expose naked pictures of their children as part of an unsuccessful bid to sell their virginities, the report says.

It quotes sources who told Legal Weekly that some virgins would fetch 5,000 yuan (£528) while some of the teenage recruiters had amassed sums of nearly £130,000.

In this case, the headmaster of the school involved is said to have declined responsibility ‘other than mediating a settlement’, the Globalpost reports.

But police have been quoted as saying that they have not found evidence of public officials being involved in prostitution – despite ‘repeated investigations’.
