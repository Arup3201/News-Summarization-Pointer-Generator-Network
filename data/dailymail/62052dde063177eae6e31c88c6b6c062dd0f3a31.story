A ticket given to a man who was caught driving his car while trying to find his way using the GPS map on his mobile phone has been upheld on appeal.

Steven Spriggs was pulled over by California's Highway Patrol and given a ticket for driving with one hand while holding the phone in the other to peer at directions on its map software.

He appealed against the ticket, but the punishment was upheld by judges at a California appellate court.

Judges ruled that using the GPS or map function on a mobile phone while driving is a moving violation on the same level as sending a text message while driving.

Spriggs was cited for 'moving violation section 23123, subdivision (a), driving a motor vehicle while using a wireless phone', on January 5 by California Highway Patrol Officer Jack Graham, according to court documents.

At his appeal, heard on April 26, both Spriggs and Officer Graham testified that he was indeed looking at a map on a phone held in his hand while driving.

The underlying facts of the case were undisputed, but Spriggs argued that the wording of the statute was not intended to cover using a wireless phone to look at a map.

He maintained lawmakers had intended to limit the application to 'conversing' or 'listening and talking' on a mobile.

Judges disagreed.

The California v. Spriggs ruling reads: 'This case requires us to determine whether using a wireless phone solely for its map application function while driving violates Vehicle Code section 23123.

'We hold that it does.'

'The judgment of conviction is affirmed': The text of the ruling handed down by the Appelate Division of Fresno Superior Court which upheld the punishment of Spriggs

Applying the test of plain language to the letter of the law, the court concluded that 'the primary evil sought to be avoided is the distraction the driver faces when using his or her hands to operate the phone.

'That distraction would be present whether the wireless telephone was being used as a telephone, a GPS navigator, a clock or a device for sending and receiving text messages and emails.'

The ruling added: 'This statute ... is specifically designed to prevent a driver from using a wireless telephone while driving unless the device is being used in a hands free manner.

'The plain language of the statute and its legislative history support that conclusion.'
