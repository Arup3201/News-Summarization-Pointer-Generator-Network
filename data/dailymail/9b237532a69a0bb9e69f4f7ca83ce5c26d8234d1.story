Two boys were rescued from an Indian sweat shop after watching an 11-year-old friend get clubbed to death by a fellow child worker.

The 13-year-olds, who typically toiled from 8am to 10pm and then slept on the bangle factory floor, were ordered by bosses to cover up the crime after the attacker fled by washing away the blood.

Deepak and Rajesh, whose names have been changed to protect their identities, were then trapped in a tiny room and forced to spend 24 hours with the bloody corpse and its smashed skull.

Labour pain: Rajesh, left, and Deepak were ordered to wash the crime spot when another worker, aged 11, was allegedly murdered by another boy, who has since run away from the Delhi bangle factory where they worked

They and the seven other children trapped in the bangle workshop, based in a two-storey house in capital New Delhi, were only freed when neighbours heard cries and called the police.

The pair, who earned just 1,000 
rupees - or £11 - a month, are now being looked after by a charity but 
remain traumatised by their ordeal.

‘We would wake up at 8am and, only 
after washing our faces, would start making bangles. Work ended by 10 at
 night by when each of us made 25 packets of bangles,' said Rajesh.

'Barely able to move a muscle, we would fall asleep right where we worked.'

He and Deepak, who are both from Kotla Bigha, a village 600 miles from Delhi, were sent by their parents to work at the sweat shop in the Jahagirpurni district in a bid to pay off their mounting debts.

‘How will my family survive if I don’t 
send home money?’ asks Deepak, who speaks like an adult despite his young age.

Suffering: Rajesh was sold by his parents to the sweat shop where he slept after toiling from morning till night

Deepak has seven brothers and sisters.
 His mother is blind and his father is an out-of-work contractor. His 
19-year-old sister is about to get married and the family is steeped in
 debts.

The pair made bangles with the victim
 as well as the murderer. But the employer also manufactured polythene 
bags in the same building and exploited seven other children in that 
business.

It was these children who were forced 
to join Deepak and Rajesh and spend an horrific 24 hours with the body of 
their friend, who authorities are calling Vinod in a bid to protect his 
real identity.

‘We knew something was wrong. We never saw any children come out of the building,’ a resident said.

Appalling: The bangle factory in New Delhi where the boys were each forced to make 25 packets a day

The
 children who worked at the bangle factory are all aged below 14, and 
India's Child Labour Act bars the employment of children below that age 
in 
hazardous works.

According 
to Rakesh Senger of NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan, which is looking after 
the two children, the National Commission for Protection of Child 
Rights, in an affidavit before the high court, had pledged to make 
Jahangirpuri a child labour-free zone.

‘That was in 2009 and we’re still looking at a hub of unregulated 
factories where many stories perhaps more heinous than those of Rajesh, 
Deepak or Vinod remain untold,’ he said.
