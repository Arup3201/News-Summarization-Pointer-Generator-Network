Paris Saint-Germain defended the Ligue 1 title for the first time in the club's history despite slipping to defeat against Rennes.

Laurent Blanc's side secured the championship shortly before kick-off after second-placed Monaco were held to a 1-1 draw by Guingamp.

The result left PSG on 83 points and with an unassailable seven-point lead at the top of the standings.

PSG, who also won the League Cup this 
season, needed Guingamp to snatch at least a point at Louis II to be 
crowned champions without kicking a ball.

Dimitar Berbatov headed Monaco ahead in the 77th minute, only for Fatih Atik to level five minutes from time.

The result triggered scenes of celebration at the Parc des Princes before PSG's game had even kicked off.

PSG have been top of their domestic lead since October and never looked like surrendering their crown.

Yet there were half-time boos at the Parc des Princes after goals by Foued Kadir and Paul-Georges Ntep gave Rennes a 2-1 lead.

Ezequiel Lavezzi opened the scoring for PSG on three minutes after being set up by Edinson Cavani.

But
 Kadir beat Salvatore Sirigu with a low shot in the 23rd minute and 
Ntep's free kick then sailed past the Italian keeper to snatch the lead.

The
 crowd's discontent made room for pure joy when striker Zlatan 
Ibrahimovic made his comeback from a five-week injury layoff when he 
came on for Lavezzi in the 56th minute.

The
 Swede forced Benoit Costil into a spectacular save with a 40-metre 
missile but he failed to add to his 30 league goals this season.

PSG defender Alex had the best chance to equalise in stoppage-time but his header crashed against the bar.

The
 result meant that Rennes, now 13th with a six-point lead over 
18th-placed Sochaux, have virtually secured their place in the top 
flight thanks to a comfortable goal difference.
