Senator Rand Paul has blasted US President Barack Obama for failing to arm all US commercial airline pilots to prevent a new 9/11 outrage.

He said handing out guns to airline pilots is the most cost effective way to protect the fleet and deter any new terror operations.

The Republican politician from Kentucky said current regulations were too cumbersome and he vowed to slice through red-tape with a proposed new law.

Speaking to Shaun Hannity on Fox News, Senator Paul accused President Obama of failing US pilots and passengers.

'I'm concerned about what is the most cost
 effective way of preventing another 9/11.

'I want all pilots to be 
armed. The President has zeroed this out of his budget and wants to get 
rid of it out of his programme.

'When I talk to pilots, I'm in airports 
all the time, pilots come up to me all the time and say "it's too hard 
to get the permit and keep up the permit".'

Senator Paul suggested the current system for licensing pilots to carry firearms in the cockpit was too bureaucratic.

'You have to do five days 
in New Mexico. I've a Bill to streamline this and the goal of my BillÂ  
is to have 100 percent of American pilots armed.

'It is the most cost 
effective way of deterring another attack on our planes.'

The politician is an 8/1 chance according to Paddy Power to secure the Republican presidential nomination to run in 2016 and 18/1 to win the White House race.
