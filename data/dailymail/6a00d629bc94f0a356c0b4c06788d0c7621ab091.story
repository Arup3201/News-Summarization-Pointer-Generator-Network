Jerry Sandusky became a state prison inmate Tuesday with his transfer out of the Centre County jail, his makeshift home since he was convicted in June of child molestation.

The 68-year-old former Penn State assistant coach arrived early in the morning at the State Correctional Institute at Camp Hill, just outside Harrisburg.

He faces testing and evaluation that will take a week or more before he can be assigned a security risk level and sent to one of the state facilities as his 'home' prison.

Appeal: Jerry Sandusky has launched an attempt to overturn his prison sentence of up to 60 years

At Camp Hill, experts will assess his mental state, physical health and education level, and determine whether he needs treatment.

Sandusky was sentenced this month to 30 to 60 years for sexual abuse of 10 boys over a 15-year period.

That hasn't stopped him from repeatedly asserted his innocence and last week filed post-sentencing motions, seeking to have convictions thrown out or a new trial.

There are about 6,800 sex offenders serving time in Pennsylvania's prison system.

The Corrections Department does not maintain special units for sex offenders, and there is no way to predict where he will be sent.

Age is not a factor in the placement of Sandusky, 68, but any medical conditions could be. Inmates from 18 to 79 are housed in general populations, although older inmates may be put in lower bunks and have other handicap accommodations. The majority of state facilities have infirmaries.

Benefits? Jerry Sandusky may be able to continue collecting his pension while behind bars

Camp Hill, in central Pennsylvania, has 3,000 to 4,000 inmates, about 1,000 of whom are held temporarily for classification.

From there, he would then be placed in a state prison based on his treatment plan and the available beds. Sex offenders must undergo mandatory treatment programs, said Department of Corrections spokeswoman Sue Bensinger.

Predictably, Sandusky was met with a cold welcome in the last state facility where he stayed since the trial.

Inmates locked up alongside Jerry Sandusky reportedly taunted him by singing 'Hey, teacher, leave those kids alone' - a line from Pink Floyd's Another Brick in the Wall.

'At night, we were singing "Hey, teacher, leave those kids alone",' one 22-year-old offender named Josh told The Daily.

Prisoners were banned from speaking directly to Sandusky, who was in a special unit reserved for sex offenders or people with mental illnesses.

They were aware of his offenses as they had access to television and newspapers, Josh added.

It suggests the hostile welcome Sandusky could have expected when he returned to the jail last week as he awaits sentencing.
