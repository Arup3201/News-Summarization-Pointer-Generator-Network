Police are searching the compound of controversial 'godman' Rampal Maharaj for explosives after he was arrested following a bloody siege on the 12-acre property.

Rampal was arrested at his sprawling compound in northern India overnight, ending a days-long standoff in which six people died and hundreds were injured.

The hugely popular religious leader, who considers himself the reincarnation of a 15th century mystic poet, was wanted on murder charges and had repeatedly ignored court summons.

This led to police storming the fortified compound with tear gas, water cannons and batons in an assault met with fierce opposition from thousands of Rampal's devoted followers.

Jawahar Yadav, a Haryana state government spokesman, said police had arrested Rampal and taken him away in an ambulance.

No violence or confrontation took place between his supporters and the police at the time of his arrest, Yadav told reporters.

More than 500 of his supporters were also arrested and another 15,000 evacuated from the 12-acre compound before he was taken into custody.

Rampal said he regretted the deaths, but denied police allegations he used his followers as human shields.

'I did not use them (as shields). They were acting on their own,' he said after being taken into police custody.

Police also have filed fresh charges against him and some of his supporters, including sedition, murder, criminal conspiracy and detaining people illegally in his fortress.

During the siege, police said they arrested more than 500 devotees, including 250 members of a 'private army' dedicated to his protection.

'It was a tough operation, we had to deal with hostile supporters,' police inspector Anil Kumar said.

'At the moment we are trying to clear the ashram, the clearing operations are on, our personnel are inside the ashram. They are trying to find if any explosives have been hidden there.'

Police believe around 2,000 followers are still inside the 12-acre compound and officers using loudspeakers today urged them to come out.

Shriniwas Vashisht, director-general of police in Haryana, said many of the thousands of people holed up with Rampal were held against their will or were used as human shields to prevent police action.

'They know that we will not allow innocent women and children to be caught in the crossfire and they are taking advantage of that.'

Authorities earlier tried to flush him out by cutting off electricity and water to the compound.

Thousands of people began streaming out of the compound yesterday, and many said armed followers of the guru had prevented them from leaving earlier.

'They closed and locked the gates inside the compound and would not let us out,' said Birender Satya, who had traveled from central India with his mother to listen to Rampal's preaching.

Another member, Jawan Singh, said he had gone into the ashram in the hope that Rampal could cure his chronic back pain, but devotees prevented him from leaving.

'I came here hoping that I'll get healed. Instead it was a war-like situation here,' the 34-year-old said from the window of a bus that was taking people away from the compound.

'The guards manning the complex gate didn't allow us to come out. They told the people to go back in.'

Rampal and 38 others have been charged with murder and other offenses after a clash between his supporters and another group killed one person in July 2006. He was freed on bail, which was canceled after his followers entered a courtroom and threatened lawyers in July.

Yesterday the guru's followers handed over to police the bodies of four women who apparently died inside the   complex, about 175 kilometers from New Delhi. Earlier in the day, a woman and an 18-month-old child died in a hospital after leaving the ashram.

India has been rocked by several scandals involving immensely popular 'godmen', mostly Hindu ascetics who claim to possess mystical powers. Last year one was charged with sexually assaulting a schoolgirl.

For many Indians, gurus play an integral role in daily life. They say they offer a pathway to enlightenment in return for spiritual devotion and often give donations to ashrams, temples and charity projects.
