It is a venue that was close to Amy Winehouse's heart, and is among the last places the singer visited in the hours before her tragic death in the summer of 2011.

Now Camden's Roundhouse is hoping to pay tribute to the iconic singer, by installing a life-size bronze statute of Amy on a terrace overlooking Chalk Farm Road.

The proposed sculpture is expected to show the late singer dressed in her signature retro style, with her hair in its trademark beehive.

Tribute: The late Amy Winehouse (seen left in 2007) was a fan of Camden's Roundhouse, which is hoping to install a life-size statue of the singer (an early picture of the planned tribute is seen right)

Sculptor Scott Eaton has been commissioned for the piece by the Roundhouse in partnership with the Amy Winehouse Trust.

A planning application submitted to Camden Council say the statue will 'show Amy in her prime, striking a pose beneath her iconic beehive'.

As well as creating a lasting tribute to the six-time Grammy winner, 27, it is hoped the sculpture would serve as a focal point for fans travelling to Camden to pay their respects to the late singer.

Favourite haunt: The Roundhouse has teamed up with the Amy Winehouse Foundation to come up with the planned tribute

Camden Square, the quiet residential street where Amy lived, remains the scene of fan pilgrimages nearly two years after she was found dead.

'The artwork aims to capture the vitality of Amy and her music by faithfully rendering her beauty and iconic sense of style,' the planning document states.

'The design has Amy relaxing on the Roundhouse terrace gazing back at Camden Town. The piece is carefully composed with naturalism.

'Her long flowing hair will be represented sculpturally with a touch of art nouveau styling. Other important style and wardrobe consideration include earrings, dress, shoes and a rose in her hair, all selected and approved by members of her family.'

'Vitality': Planning documents submitted to Camden Council state that the sculpture, seen left and right in early images of the proposed project, would aim to capture Amy's 'beauty and iconic sense of style'

Mr Eaton has worked on several high-profile projects including the hit films War Horse and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.

The organisers behind the scheme have said they would not allow the statue to become a 'shrine', and a sign would be installed asking that visitors do not leave gifts or flowers.

The sculpture, while visible from the road, would not be lit up at night, the application states.

Amy supported Paul Weller at the Roundhouse in 2006 as part of the BBC'S Electric Proms.

If it gets the go ahead from Camden Council, the statue would be unveiled on September 14 this year - one what would have been the singer's 30th birthday.

Pilgrimages: Fans continue to gather at the late singer's house nearly two years on from her tragic death

The plans for the statue were first revealed by Amy's father Mitch Winehouse last summer, who said: 'Amy was in love with Camden'.

'We wanted to have a bench in her memory outside her house in Camden Square, but there are so many hoops you have to jump through to do that, planning permission for one,' he said at the time.

Mr Winehouse has also been quick to dismiss some critics who questioned whether a statue of the singer was appropriate given her high-profile battles with alcohol and drugs.

'The reason why there is going to be a statue of Amy at the Roundhouse, hopefully, is because everybody loved Amy,' he said.

'Amy was a human being and she was a strong girl who had weaknesses.'

He said his daughter 'did a lot for Camden, did a lot for kids', adding: 'Why the hell shouldn't we put a statue up?'.
