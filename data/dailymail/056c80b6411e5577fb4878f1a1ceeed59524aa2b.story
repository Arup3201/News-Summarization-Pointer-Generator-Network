The wife of convicted child molester Jerry Sandusky has broken her silence for the first time since he was sent to prison for the rest of his life.

Dottie Sandusky has spoken to the Today Show's Matt Lauer and though it will air in full on Wednesday, a teaser was released today.

'A friend had written to him and asked him what he missed, what did he take most for granted?' she said.

Teary-eyed: Dottie Sandusky opens up about how prison has changed her husband, former assistant Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky

Behind bars: Sandusky, seen center in October, was found guilty on 45 of 48 counts of child abuse and will spend between 30 and 60 years behind bars- depending on how long he lives

'He said family meals, the fun time with the grandkids playing ball, (and) doing special things with friends.'

She broke down in tears in the middle of her sentence, pausing to compose herself before continuing.

This will be the first time that Dottie has spoken on camera in support of her husband, but it is not the first time that she has made her defense of the former Penn State assistant football coach known.

She testified in support of him during his trial, and she wrote a letter to an appeals judge on his behalf.

Opening up: Dottie started to cry when she told how her husband of 46-years wrote to a friend saying that the things he missed most were his grandchildren and doing 'special things with friends'

'Jerry always put others before himself and always wanted to make each person feel special no matter who they were,' she wrote of her husband of 46-years according to NBC.

'Like all of us he has his faults, one is he cares so much for people always wanting them to reach their potential.'

Jerry Sandusky was found guilty on 45 of 48 counts of child abuse.

The 70-year-old former coach was sentenced to a minimum of at least 30 to 60 years behind bars, which the judge explained was set to insure that he will die in prison. He originally faced a maximum sentence of 442 years in prison.

Support: Dottie stood by her husband and was at his side during his 2012 trial

The pages of graphic charging documents filed against Sandusky told how he preyed on young, underprivileged boys who he met through his charity, The Second Mile.

His connections to the revered Penn State football program and their ensuing cover-up resulted in the firing of both legendary coach Joe Paterno and the head of the athletic program as well as the resignation of the university president.

While Jerry Sandusky gave several unnerving and ill-advised interviews ahead of his trial, this is the first time that Dottie has spoken out to the media.

She was mentioned at two memorable points in the trial, as two different victims told how she was allegedly within earshot when their respective abuse took place and chose not to stop it.

One of the couple's six adopted children, Matt, was willing to testify for the state prosecutors about how he underwent seven years of abuse at the hands of his father.

He spoke about the abuse, and whether or not his father's actions were an open secret in the football-loving community, in a documentary that premiered at Sundance Film Festival.
