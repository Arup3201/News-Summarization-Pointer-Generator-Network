James Der Derian, Director of the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney, said the website 'alert people to the dark side of the internet'

A top security expert says a website exposing CCTV footage from hundreds of Australian businesses and homes is a good thing 'to alert people to the dark side of the internet'. 

James Der Derian, Director of the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney, made the comments after website insecam.com was launched revealing 924 CCTV camera streams across the country. 

The website is running more than 70,000 streams from security cameras monitoring businesses, building sites, factories and homes and is available for anyone on the internet to view. 

The site is running 924 Australian feeds from cameras which have not had their password changed from factory settings without the knowledge of the owners of the cameras.

Mr Der Derian said this sort of website was always going to be 'inevitable'. 

The security expert told Daily Mail Australia: 'Everyone thinks the internet is this perfect way of communicating. 

'The whole idea of the internet is a way of access and unless you have very strong password protection and encryption then this kind of exposure is inevitable.  

The website insecam.com is running footage from more than 73,000 cameras round the world

Security experts say members of the internet need to beware of the pitfalls of the internet

Owners of the cameras have no idea that their footage is being streamed for the whole world to see online

'This was always going to be likely.Everyone relies on the internet for security, communications, and protection. 

'This shows that it has got a flip side and people uploading personal details need to be careful, this website is an example of that. 

'It does not surprise me and it is a good thing to alert people to the darker side of the internet. People are so willing to give up personal information.' 

Internet protocol cameras, or IP cameras, are the ones being streamed on the website and they are seen as a cheaper option than CCTV camera systems, reports ABC.

The cameras are located in businesses, factories, building sites and private homes

The website is running footage from CCTV from seven Domino's Pizza restaurants in Queensland and 'immediate action' has been taken. 

Domino's chief operations officer Andrew Megson told ABC: 'Domino's has been alerted to the CCTV footage from one of its stores viewable online and moved to change the passwords and shut down the live footage immediately.'

Staff were seen making pizzas and conversing with customers in the footage.
