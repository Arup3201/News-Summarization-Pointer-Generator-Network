The Las Vegas stripper involved in a deadly car crash this past March, plead not guilty in court Monday.

26-year-old Shauna Miller was charged with driving under the influence causing death. A Clark County District Court judge set her trial for December 9.

Miller killed a man the morning of March 23 when she ploughed into his car in Las Vegas as his two-year-old son sat in the back seat.

The crash resulted in the death of 33-year-old James White. Fortunately his son survived the collision uninjured.

Miller told police that she had been driving her Hummer H2 when she entered an intersection and hit White's car as he turned right, according to her arrest report.

White died instantly. A witness testified about the incident earlier this month at one of Miller's hearings.

“As I was merging into that one single 
lane going around the accident, and seeing how crushed that drivers side
of the Ford escort, he was gone,” said witness Rictor Riolo.

Officers noted in the report that her eyes appeared glassy as they questioned her at the scene of the crash.

She told police she had drunk two beers that morning while working at Spearmint Rhino strip club, Fox 5 News reports. She also said she had taken a Xanax pill at 8pm the night before.

Miller failed two stages of a sobriety test and was subsequently booked for driving under the influence, according to the police report. Samples of her blood were later taken at the Clark County Detention Center.

Witness: A witness of the incident said the impact was so powerful, it was obvious that the driver hadn't survived

Outlook: If convicted, Miller faces up to 20 years in jail and a $5,000 fine

Prosecutors are arguing that Miller had twice the legal limit of alcohol in her system,  and five times the legal amount of marijuana when she left her job that morning.

Miller told officers that she had tried to brake but was unable to avoid a collision with White's car, the Las Vegas Sun reports.

Investigators have not determined which vehicle ran a stoplight before the collision, according to the Sun.

Miller, who had a temporary Nevada driver's license, told officers she had worked at the strip club from 2 am until 5.30am

If found guilty, Miller could spent up to 20 years in prison and a $5,000 fine.

She remains at the Clark County Detention Center on $200,000 bail.
