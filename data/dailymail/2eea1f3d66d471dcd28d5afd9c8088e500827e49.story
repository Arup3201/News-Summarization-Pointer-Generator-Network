Facebook is said to be thinking about launching a dislike button, as an alternative way for members to show they care, without appearing insensitive

When a pet dies, or a Facebook user posts about bad news, clicking the Like button to express sympathy doesn’t feel quite right.

So, with this in mind, the social network is said to be thinking of alternative ways for its members to show they care, without appearing tactless or insensitive.

Mark Zuckerberg admitted he is working on a dislike button - but it is unlikely to be called dislike.

Speaking at the firm’s offices in California, Mr Zuckerberg said: ‘We need to figure out the right way to do it so [the button] ends up being a force for good, not a force for bad.’

He continued that people could use a button designed to express negative sentiment in the ‘wrong way’, that could be deemed cruel or mean.

However, when such a button will be introduced is not known, and the site has been talking about the feature since 2010.

In the meantime, people can send a Dislike sticker in Facebook Messenger posts.

It is available as part of the Likes sticker package, which also includes a heart, a peace sign, a protest fist, a hand holding a bunch of flowers and a glass of Champagne, among others.

According to recent research, the most annoying Facebook posts that would warrant the use of a dislike button are those that brag about dieting and exercising.

This was followed by people who share every meal, and cryptic statuses designed to seek attention by being deliberately vague.

Facebook scams have previously exploited user’s demand for a dislike button to install malware and infect accounts.

In particular, the Enable Dislike Button scam claims to offer the opposite to a like button and began appearing on many Facebook users' walls back in 2011.

If and when Facebook launches a dislike button, or similar, it will be included as part of the site and not available through a download or link.

Sweatband.com asked 1,793 people who their most annoying contacts on social media are.

1. Diet and exercise boasters - 53 per cent

Users who post about every calorie they consume and every second they spend exercising.

2. Those who share every meal - 45 per cent

Wannabe chefs who share pictures of every meal they eat.

Vague updates that seek attention. These enquiries are usually met with 'I don’t want to talk to about it'.

4. Game inviters - 37 per cent

Users who ask friends and followers to play the same game as them to aid in their progress.

5. Proud parents - 36 per cent

When parents constantly update their followers on their children.

6. Oversharers - 32 per cent

Social media users who share incredibly personal details.

7. Checker-inners - 26 per cent

Users who share every single place they go to.

8. Event spammers - 25 per cent

Users who invite people to every event they can think of, even when you don't live in the same city - or even country - as them.

9. Constant engagers - 22 per cent

Those who like and comment on everything, from friend statuses and photos to brand updates.

10. Self-promoters - 19 per cent

Usually small business owners who treat every friend or follower as a prospective customer.
