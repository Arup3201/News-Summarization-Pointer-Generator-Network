A baby boy who was hurled 200ft by floodwater that tore down his bedroom wall has been found alive.

One-year-old Tristan Scarcy was asleep on Tuesday when a mudslide burst into the family home in Joshua Tree, California.

His parents rushed to find him, but the entire room had already been gutted by the storm, which saw an inch of rain fall in less than 25 minutes.

Incredibly, as they surveyed the tragic scene the next morning, they spotted something in the mud across a field: Tristan.

Miracle: One-year-old Tristan Scarcy was asleep when the mudslide burst into his room and sent him flying

Incredible: The boy appeared to have suffered few injuries after the wall of his bedroom (pictured) collapsed

Despite being in shock, the infant appeared healthy and simply relieved to be taken home.

'We really thought he was gone,' his mother Ryan Scarcy told NBC.

'We came round thinking we can break a window to get in, and the wall was gone.

'His room was gone and he was nowhere to be found.'  

Stains on the wall of the now-destroyed home show how the waves swept in under a doorway, then rose to the ceiling before bursting out of a wall and into the front yard, over a barbed wire fence.

The mud rose so high  that they had to force their way into the wreckage before they could see the little boy poking out of the mud.

Discovered: This is the rough plain of mud where Tristan's parents saw him poking his head out hours later

Dangerous: He scaled a barbed wire fence during the flash floods which saw an inch of rain fall in 20 minutes

Manic: The family had no hope that Tristan would survive after seeing all the broken glass in his room 

Tristian's father Brian Bennett said: 'My friend busted the living room window, came in here and pointed out "dude, your son's over there". 

'So I turned around, saw him and he poked his head out the mud.

'He was in shock.' 

Tristan was sent flying with all his belongings, which are now buried in the mud along with all the family's furniture, clothes and treasured possessions.

Shocked: They were shocked as they looked out of the bedroom to see the infant lodged in the mud 200ft away

But his mother Ryan says Tristan's safety is all that matters.

'I'm really thankful to have our son and that was the most important thing to us, that he is still alive.' 

The family's traumatic experience came as vast swathes of Joshua Tree National Park were destroyed by the floods which hit on Monday and lasted for more than 24 hours.

Some areas reported up to five inches of rain in just a few hours.
