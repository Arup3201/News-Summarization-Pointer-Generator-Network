Footage has surfaced of an Australian news reporter speaking to the man believed to be an Islamic State (IS) militant back in 2011.

9News foreign correspondent Peter Stefanovic came face-to-face with former British rapper Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary one evening when tensions were high on the streets of London during the 2011 riots.

Previously, Bary has been thought to be 'Jihadi John' - an extremist who has been linked to the execution of five Western aid workers in the Middle East.

In footage aired on Monday night's 9News bulletin, Stefanovic is seen interviewing another man before Bary commands control of the microphone.

'Let me tell you something', Bary said.

'The police are protecting the police station, they're not protecting the people.

'A policeman said it out of his own words when I asked him "why are you here".

'He said I'm here to protect the police.'

Stefanovic told 9News he met Bary on the first night of the riots on the streets of Tottenham in North London. 

'There were hundreds of young people loitering near a burning building that police and firefighters were trying to control,' he said.

'There was a lot of friction and tension simmering on the streets and this group of young men crowded around me as I was filming a piece-to-camera.'

Most recently he has been linked to the beheading of U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig who was killed along with a group of Syrian soldiers in a chilling video released on Sunday night

While the Australian broadcaster is reporting Bary is Jihadi John, it emerged in September British intelligence official did not believe he was the notorious terrorist.

But they did know Bary had travelled to Syria last year, and is linked to Jihadi John and the beheading videos.

This comes following the news that Jihadi John was injured in a US airstrike which killed at least 10 other IS fighters.

The masked ‘executioner’ with a London accent - who has beheaded two British and three American hostages - is believed to have narrowly escaped death on Saturday.

He was attending a summit of the group’s leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border. 

Jihadi John rose to international notoriety when he appeared in videos where he beheaded British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning as well as U.S. journalists James Foley and Steve Sotloff. 

Most recently he has been linked to the beheading of U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig who was killed along with a group of Syrian soldiers in a chilling video released on Sunday night.

Unlike most western Muslim recruits who are normally foot soldiers or guards, the extremist has risen in the IS ranks to become a senior figure from the role of prison guard.

He has been appointed as a member of a governing body of an IS 'wilayat' or province.

A Daily Mail source adds Jihadi John does not live in Raqqa - the Syrian hub of the terror group - but in Al Bukamal, a small desert town which borders Iraq.

Jihadi John is believed to be between the ages of 28 and 31, and is fluent in English, Arabic and classical Arabic, which is used in the Koran.

He first joined IS in Iraq when he left the U.K., but then moved to Syria.
