Furious parents have blasted the BBC’s new children’s series Topsy and Tim, branding it 'flabbergastingly sexist'.

The new version of Topsy and Tim, which hit screens earlier this month on CBeebies, was supposed to have been updated for the 21st century.

But despite dad using a tablet computer and mum spending time on her laptop, the series - inspired by the hugely popular books and animated TV show of the same name - appears to be stuck in the past.

The new series of Topsy and Tim has caused controversy: L-R, Topsy (Jocelyn Macnab), Dad/Brian (Chris Hannon), Grandma Jean (Suzy Aitchison), Tim (Joshua Lester)

Since the first of 60 episodes aired on November 10, thousands of parents have flocked to internet forum Mumsnet to express their opposition to the show.

Most of the outrage is over the way the characters conform to gender stereotypes.

One parent, who called themselves MadBannersAndCopPorn posted: 'I caught it for the first time tonight and thought it was a load of rubbish.

'I hated the boys playing on quads and girls decorating princess cupcakes too - Tim’s friend a boy, Topsy’s a girl etc

The show is inspired by the hugely popular books (pictured) and animated TV show of the same name

'P**sed all over my fond childhood memories of reading the books....'

Another parent, called DoubleLifeIsALifeOfSorts added: 'It’s flabbergastingly sexist - I was so disappointed.

'Mummy and Topsy do the washing while Tim helps daddy with the man’s work.

'Topsy is inside making cakes and Tim gets told they’re not for him and he must go outside and play with the quad bike.

'I can’t let my three-and-a-half-year-old watch it, he already thinks girls can’t do stuff that boys can.'

Meanwhile some mums have revealed actress Anna Acton, who plays the children’s mother, has a large following of husbands.

Mumsnet
user, who calls themselves nomeansno20 said: 'I want to thank CBEEBIES 
for topsy and tim series. Its the only time my hubby sits down with the 
kids.

The original Topsy and Tim was a firm favorite among children

The new Topsy and Tim are felt by parents to conform to old fashioned gender stereotypes

'I’m sure its cos 
yummy mummy Anna Acton is so lush. I’m not jealous tho, its funny to see
him perk up whenever she comes on screen.

'Anyone else becoming a Topsy and Tim widow?'

Earlier this month the BBC was accused of running out of ideas for new shows when they announced plans to remake the Clangers along with Topsy and Tim.

Channel 5 also announced plans to bring back the Wombles for 52 new episodes in 2015.
