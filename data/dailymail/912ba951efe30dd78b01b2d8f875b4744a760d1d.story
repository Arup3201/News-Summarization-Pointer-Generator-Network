A lonely middle-aged woman who became obsessed with a 15-year-old boy who she met at school before inviting him to do gardening work at her home has been spared a jail term for having sex with him.

Kylie Fiona Henry, 40, was acquitted in November of raping the boy in her Adelaide home in April 2011, but was found guilty  of the less serious charge of unlawfully having sexual intercourse with him by a jury at the South Australian District Court.

On Friday, Judge Paul Cuthbertson suspended a two year jail term and placed the former school canteen manager on a three-year good behaviour bond with conditions including she undertake 230 hours of community service.

Kylie Fiona Henry, 40, received a two year suspended jail sentence on Friday despite admitting to unlawfully having sexual intercourse with a 15-year-old boy at her Adelaide home in 2011

Henry was 38 when she slept with the victim, who was sleeping over at her home with his younger sisters who had befriended Henry's children.

'You were entrusted with the complainant's safety that night by his mother and used the opportunity to satisfy your own sexual desires,' Judge Cuthbertson said.

'You were in the position of parent. He was staying in your house with the permission of his mother.' Â

The victim had told the court Henry, a mother of three, had robbed him of his first sexual encounter and the incident had left him scared and confused.

'I felt ill. I can't trust women and I hate them,' he said.

The court heard that Henry had first met the boy when he was in primary school.

The court heard how Henry became obsessed with the boy after the incident, visiting his home nearly every day over the next three months

She then began a conversation with the boy's mother when he returned to the school to watch his younger sisters play sport, which led the boy to be invited to her house for some gardening work.

After the incident, Henry became obsessed with the boy, visiting his home nearly every day over the next three months, the judge said.

Henry's utterances to a friend on Facebook 'made it perfectly clear, you were obsessed with him and had a sexual interest'.

'You now admit your defence was an utter concoction,'Judge Cuthbertson added.

She told the jury she did not have sex with the boy, but did have a passionate dream about them having sex.

Kylie Fiona Henry's lawyer said her client's behaviour was not pre-meditated but had been an 'appalling lack of judgment'.

Henry was a lonely, single mother, who suffered from low self-esteem, Judge Cuthbertson said.

'In some respects, you are a person to be pitied - life has not dealt you a good hand,' he said.
