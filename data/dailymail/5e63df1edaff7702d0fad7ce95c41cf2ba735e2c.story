A former fast food waiter is suing Hardeeâ€™s restaurant chain, claiming his supervisor pressured him into a sexual relationship and fired him when he ended it.

Gerald Anderson alleged manager Danielle Dahlenburg hired him in August
 2012 and subjected him to 'unwanted sexual advances, requests for 
sexual favors and sexual touching', according to 
court documents filed on February 5.

The South Dakota man claims he had sex with Dahlenburg for at least two months because she led him to believe it was a job requirement.

Lawsuit: Former fast food waiter Gerald Anderson is suing the Hardee's restaurant chain, claiming his supervisor forced him into a sexual relationship and fired him when he ended

Legal position: Anderson's attorney, Sarah Baron Houy (pictured), claims Dahlenburg acted illegally when she allegedly preyed on Anderson

'When she hired him, Dahlenburg told 
plaintiff that if he 'applied' himself and worked with her 'on and off 
the clock' he could advance to a management position,' the suit alleges.

'Dahlenburg led plaintiff to believe that his submission to her sexual 
advances was a condition of his employment and that he would be fired, 
or otherwise retaliated against, if he did not acquiesce.'

Anderson's
 suit claims that he ended the relationship in October 2012 and was sacked about a week later.

His attorney, Sarah Baron Houy, claims the manager's 
behavior was illegal under federal and state employment law.

'The
 primary allegation that we have here is that his employment was 
conditioned upon his participation in a sexual relationship with his 
supervisor and that constitutes unlawful employment discrimination,' she told Rapid City Journal.

Anderson first took his claims against the Northland Restaurant Group, operating as Hardee's, to state and federal fair employment agencies, claiming the business violated anti-discrimination laws. The agencies said he had a right to sue.

Anderson is seeking unspecified punitive
 and compensatory damages for lost wages, benefits, attorney fees and 
other costs due to 'humiliation and embarrassment'.

It is not clear if Dahlenburg, who is not named as a defendant in the suit, still works at the chain.

Houy said Hardee's has not yet filed a response to the lawsuit.
