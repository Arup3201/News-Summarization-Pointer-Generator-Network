An Iraqi oil tanker that disappeared from radar off the coast of Texas last week has suddenly reappeared today - and it's still full of $100million in crude.

The United Kalavrvta is at the center of a legal and political battle over Iraq's oil wealth between the  Kurdish region in the north of the country and the central government in Baghdad.

The tanker vanished from U.S. Coast Guard tracking systems on Thursday and is believed to have shut off its transponder. 

The ship, which has 1million barrels of crude oil aboard, reappeared on radar on Monday - in almost exactly the same spot where it was when it vanished.

It's currently in the  Galveston Offshore Lightering Area, where large ships that can't fit in the Port of Galveston wait to be unloaded. 

As the disintegration of Iraq amid mounting violence continues, the semi-autonomous regime in Kurdistan is trying to cash in on Iraq's oil reserves and export its own crude.

Iraqi Kurdistan has exported at least eight million barrels of oil since May, energy experts told Al Arabiya News.

But the increasingly weak regime in Baghdad is trying to keep control of its oil billions and says the Kurdish regime cannot sell the oil in the U.S.

The U.S. Coast Guard's AIS ship-tracking system showed no position for the United Kalavrvta on Thursday, which was carrying one million barrels - and was 95 per cent - when it went dark.

The tanker was attempting to unload its cargo at sea, off the coast of Texas, after leaving the Turkish port of Ceyhan in June and anchoring near the U.S. port of Galveston in late July.

The U.S. Coastguard confirmed to MailOnline today that the last contact the agency had with the United Kalavyrta was when the ship's certificate of compliance was completed on July 27.  

The vessel's disappearance was thought to be the latest development in a high-stakes dispute between Baghdad and the Kurds over the right to export oil.

Several other tankers transporting disputed oil from Iran or Kurdistan have switched off their transponders before unloading their cargo - making their movements extremely difficult to track.

A Coast Guard official told MailOnline today that the vessel might have turned off its beacon in the Gulf of Mexico, which it is not supposed to do.

The tanker Kamari, which had been carrying a partial load of crude oil from Iraqi Kurdistan turned off its satellite transponder on August 17, north of Egypt's Sinai. 

It reappeared unladen on August 19 about 30 kilometers off the coast of Israel, ship tracking data on Reuters showed last week. 

It was not possible to determine where the oil had been delivered to or who the buyer was.

A spokesman for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) Ministry of Natural Resources would not comment on the tanker's temporary disappearance at the time. 

Reuters reported on July 31 that tanker United Emblem, which was carrying more than 1 million barrels of Kurdish oil, had been offloaded into another tanker in the South China Sea.

A senior executive at Marine Management Services confirmed in July that the ship-to-ship transfer involving the United Emblem took place in a 'legitimate operation'.

The ship is 'fixed to a legitimate charterer and performing legitimate operations,' said Kostas Georgopoulos, the chartering manager at Marine Management Services

'The ship is still in international waters,' he added.

The agency has a HC-144 Ocean Sentry aircraft at its disposal which last took images of the  oil tanker United Kalavyrta on July 25.

Only a few days ago, the partially-full Kamari tanker carrying Kurdish crude oil, disappeared from satellite tracking north of Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.

Two days later, the empty vessel reappeared near Israel. 

In late July, the tanker United Emblem offloaded part of its cargo of Kurdish crude oil onto another ship in the South China Sea.

The evasive behavior is the result of Baghdad wanting to block the Kurds from exporting the oil as they believe they have the exclusive right to do so. 

The Iraqi government in Baghdad has filed a lawsuit in a U.S. court to reclaim control of the United Kalavrvta cargo and block the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) from delivering its cargo.  

The suit demonstrates that Baghdad is now stepping up their legal and diplomatic push to block Kurdistan's oil deals, which they view as smuggling. 

However, the Kurds see such deals as crucial to their own dreams of independence.  

On Monday, the U.S. court threw out the order  saying it lacked jurisdiction to seize the tanker as it disappeared some 60 miles off their coast.

But the judge invited Iraq to re-plead its case over the cargo's rightful ownership.

The issue is expected to fuel tensions between Washington and Baghdad, as in theory, Iraq can file claims against anyone taking delivery of the oil.

A Coast Guard official said the vessel in the Gulf of Mexico might have turned off its beacon, sailed beyond antennas that monitor transponders, or perhaps some antennas might have been taken out of service.

However, dozens of vessels were visible on Thursday in the Galveston Offshore Lightering Area, where the Kurdish tanker was last seen.
