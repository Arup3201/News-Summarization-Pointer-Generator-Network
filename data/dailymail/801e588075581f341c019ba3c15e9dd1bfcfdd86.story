The charming moment two playful deer frolicked  in a giant mud bath has been captured on camera.

A mother and her four-month-old calf splashed and rolled in the Suffolk mud, covering themselves in the brown sludge.

Her hesitant calf watched closely as she wallowed in the mud and eventually submerged her whole body.

Wildlife photographer Paul Sawer was thrilled to capture the tender moment at the Mismere RSPB reserve in Suffolk

The playful youngster finally followed its mother but managed to get mud in its ears.

Completely covered, the pair then rushed to the middle of the pond to shake off the mud and bathe in the water.

Wildlife photographer Paul Sawer, from Saxmundham, Suffolk, travelled to the Mismere RSPB reserve in Suffolk to capture the moment. 

The 41-year-old said: 'I set up a hide near a wallowing pool and waited for the deer to arrive.

'It is a popular place for the deer and several visit throughout the day. After a few hours two eventually arrived.

'The mother immediately began to kick the water to make sure there are no hidden objects before laying down.

Shaking off the mud, the two deer were captured playing together for several minutes before returning to the wood

The deer seemed to find their playtime blissful as they languished in the water

'Her calf seemed more reluctant to go into the mud and at first watched the mum roll around covering herself with mud.

'The calf follows his mum's behaviour but is not as skilled and soon gets mud in his ears.

'He stands up to shake it out but has no luck so heads for the middle of the pool and begins to bathe.'

Mr Sawer was thrilled to have captured the moment when the family members take a dip in a mud bath.

He added: 'I love the action and the fact they are splashing water.

'I was thrilled to obtain images containing their interesting behaviour.

'After their quick bath, both deer then wander off back into the woods to feed.'
