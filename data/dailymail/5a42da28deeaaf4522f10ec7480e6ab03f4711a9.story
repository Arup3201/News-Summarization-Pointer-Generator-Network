Tragic: Dominick Andujor, right, died in his bed after an intruder broke into his house and slashed his throat, while his 12-year-old sister, Amber, left, was severely injured in the attack

Dominick Andujor, aged six, was stabbed to death early Sunday inside his home in Camden.

Authorities said his 12-year-old 
sister also was critically wounded, her throat slit, as she slept in 
another room. Sunday was the girl's birthday.

She is hospitalized at Cooper University Hospital in Camden. The hospital won't discuss her condition, citing privacy concerns.

Investigators said the children were 
being watched by a 14-year-old girl when the attack happened around 2am 
Sunday. She was unharmed.

Police say the attacker broke into 
the children's house at about 2.30am and stole into an upstairs bedroom,
where he savaged the two children.

After she was attacked, Amber Andujor ran through her neighborhood screaming for help - her throat cut open and bleeding profusely.

She was rushed to the hospital, where she was fighting for her life in critical condition on her birthday.

Her brother Dominick, six, died in the house.

Manhunt: Police searched for the attacker all Sunday before finally tracking him down in the evening and arresting him

Arrest scene: Osvaldo Rivera was found hiding between a mattress and a bedroom wall at an apartment in the 3200 block of River Road

The children's mother was at a hospital for surgery on Sunday and was not home at the time of the attack.

The victims' 14-year-old sister was
looking after them. She was asleep at the time. A third sister, aged 
nine, in the house was also uninjured.

Prosecutors said the 12-year-old girl identified her attacker as what sounded like 'Poppy.'

Investigators later determined that Rivera lived in the area and went by the nickname 'Popeye,' 6ABC reported.

The 31-year-old was taken into 
custody at around 4pm on Sunday at an apartment in the 3200 block of 
River Road, where he was found hiding between a mattress and a bedroom 
wall.

'Several citizens came forward and 
showed the courage to provide information, which helped lead to the 
initial apprehension,' said Camden County Prosecutor’s Office Lieutenant
Frank Falco.

Police also said they seized blood-stained sneakers that matched bloody footprints in the victims 
'home on Ware Street. Charges were filed against Rivera about 2am Monday
morning.

Shocking: The attack deeply shook resident of Camden, New Jersey, the murder capital of the nation

According to investigators, during 
his questioning Rivera had revealed that he had smoked 'wet,' a 
combination of marijuana and PCP, prior to the killing.

'In recent years there have been several other murders in which wet 
appeared to have played a part,' prosecutors said in a statement cited by ABC. 'This 
drug has a particularly catastrophic effect on people, making them 
incoherent, hallucinatory and, in come cases, violent.'

In a recent incident, authorities believe Chevonne Thomas was high on 'wet' when she beheaded her two-year-old son Zahree on August 22 in Camden.

Thomas had a history of substance abuse and mental health disorders, according to the Department of Children and Families.

After the attack early Sunday morning, 12-year-old Amber ran out of the house and began pounding on doors, screaming for help.

She banged on several doors until neighbor Nakyta McCray woke up and found her, barely alive.

'I went to the house and saw her sitting there with her throat cut open and barely breathing,' she told ABC Philadelphia. 

Even gravely injured, Amber was able to identify her attacker, authorities said.

Popeye is a well-known figure in the neighborhood, who lives at the end of the block where the attack occurred.

Neighbors say he often gives children haircuts and is trusted by parents.

'Everybody
knows him. He’s on this block everyday; playing with the kids, talking 
to some of the adults. It’s very shocking,' Ms McCray told CBS Philadelphia.

Even in Camden, a beleaguered city with the highest murder rate in the United States, this brutal attack shocked residents.

'I can't sleep. It could have been anybody's child, not just her. My prayers go out to the family. I'm praying for her, I just hope that she makes it,' Karina Mejia told ABC Philadelphia.

A makeshift memorial of flowers and teddy bears sprang up on the block where Dominick was murdered.

Dominick and his sisters spent much of the summer at the local community center, where he had breakfast and lunch and liked doing arts and crafts.

'He had fun all summer. He liked to play; he liked to have fun; he liked football,'  Cynthia Pulliam, director of the center, told the Philadelphia Inquirer.

'He was so much full of joy.'
