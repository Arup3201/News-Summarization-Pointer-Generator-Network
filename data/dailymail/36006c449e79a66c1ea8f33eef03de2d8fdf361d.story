A 10-year-old girl, charged with killing a baby in July, almost caused the death of another, according to that girl's parents.

Ashley Tenney and Chad Hopkins have named the 10-year-old as being responsible for their daughter's hospitalisation in June, brought on by sudden seizures.

Doctors found the same medication in eight-month-old Jaylynn's system that is used by the accused girl to control her attention deficit hyperactivity disorder after they had been left alone together. 

Tenney and Hopkins were living with Amanda Huard, mother of the accused, in the basement of their home, the Maine Sunday Telegram reported.

They say the girl was alone with their daughter on June 19, while Hopkins was elsewhere in the house and Tenney was out at work.

The couple trusted the girl, they said, that she had shown a 'healthy interest' in their daughter up until that point, offering to help with diaper changes and bathing.

When Tenney arrived home from her shift at Dunkin' Donuts she found her daughter pale and sweating.

'She was soaked in sweat, just drenched,' said Tenney, 20. 'She was so pale. Whiter than a sheet of paper.'

As they rushed her to the emergency room at MaineGeneral Medical Centre in Waterville, Jaylynn began convulsing and fitting. 

'She was on her father's lap, and her head just dropped back, and she rapidly started shaking,' Tenney said. 'The first one lasted like 20 seconds.'

The sudden seizures baffled doctors at first as they struggled to work out what had brought them on.
Medical experts consulted one another and Jaylynn was transferred to Maine Medical Centre in Portland to be reassessed.

Tragic: The 10-year-old girl has since been charged with manslaughter in connection with the death of 3-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway last month

'If her head went to the left her arm went to the right and vice versa,' she said. 'Her heart rate was high and they were worried and didn't know what to do for her.'

In Portland doctors probed Tenney about what medications were in Huard's house, matching up the 10-year-old's attention deficit hyperactivity disorder drugs with what they found in Jaylynn's system.

So much was detected, Tenney said, that her daughter 'should have been dead'. She added that there 'wasn't any way' she could have ingested the medication on her own.

In the days following the scare Tenney and Hopkins began looking for a new place to live, sickened by the belief that Huard's daughter had deliberately hurt their own.

She said she had found a canvas bag in a drawer in the 10-year-old's bedroom, filled with more than 100 photographs of Jaylynn, some torn, others with words like 'my baby girl' written on them.

The couple were interviewed by workers from the DHHS Office of Child and Family Services, as were with the 10-year-old and her mother. All four were told that the girl should not be given care of young children.

Brooklyn's mother, Nicki, said traces of the 10-year-old's medication was found in her daughter's system

But despite the warnings the girl was once again left alone with a toddler just three weeks later, this time three-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway whose mother, Nicki, had left in Huard's care overnight.

On July 9 Tenney said she was woken at 1.30am to the sound of crying, pounding footsteps and the word 'dead'.

Brooklyn died during the course of that night, the ADHD drug present in her system.

The 10-year-old has been charged with manslaughter in Brooklyn's death. Huard is not facing charges but the Department of Health and Human services said an agency review showed she had neglected the three-month-old child. 

'Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway has died as a result of your neglect,' said the notice.

'You knew that (the 10-year-old) should not be babysitting children but have continued to allow her to do so.'

Ms Greenaway has since said she blames Huard for her daughter's death.

'I feel a little bit of relief that they're charging her daughter at this point, but the mom really needs to be responsible,' Greenaway said.

'She's the one I left my daughter with.'

Now Ashley Tenney claims her daughter, eight-month-old Jaylynn, was also drugged by the girl on June 19

Jaylynn suffered seizures brought on by having enough of the medication in her system that she 'should have died' and was hospitalised for two days
