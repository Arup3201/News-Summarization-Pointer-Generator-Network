A fisherman got the fright of his life when the catch he was reeling in was attacked and stolen by a great white shark.

Filmed in the Bay of Islands, New Zealand a man can be seen fishing from the side of a boat – his rod bent under the pressure.

Struggling to reel in the seemingly huge fish, the man states ‘he’s not happy about coming over here anyway.’

But as his winding becomes less resistant, the video maker remarks that everything is okay as the notion of the fish reaches the surface.

Lifting the catch from the water, the filmmaker asks ‘what have we got?’ before cursing the man’s luck at the state of the fish.

Although difficult to see in the video, the fish doesn't appear to be alive or in one  whole piece.

Out of nowhere a great white shark leaps from the water and snatches the fish from the line

Undeterred, the fisherman continues to lift the fish from the water with the intention of bringing it onboard.

But suddenly out of nowhere a great white shark leaps from the water and with its huge jaw opened, snatches the fish from the line.

On board, the people react in shock and burst into laughter as the shark continues off around the side of the boat and disappears with a splash.

The great white shark is so huge it has no natural predators other than the killer whale

According to Grind TV, the guide undertaking the fishing trip belongs to Captain Bucko’s Fishing charters, who remarked that he had never seen a great white shark in the Bay of Islands before.

The great white is a species of large lamniform shark found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans.

Due to its huge size and powerful bite force, the marine mammal has no natural predators other than the killer whale.
