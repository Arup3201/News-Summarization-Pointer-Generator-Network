The court battle between supermodel Linda Evangelista and billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault over child support has ended as both parties announcing their acceptance of a deal.

'We are happy that we were able to reach an agreement for the benefit and well-being of our son, Augie,' Evangelista and Francois-Henri Pinault said in a statement issued through a spokesman.

The former couple had been in an extensive legal process over how much Pinault should pay Evangelista for the care of their 5-year-old son.

Businesslike: Unlike prior appearances where she wore floral dresses, Evangelista opted for a sombre skirt suit on Tuesday

A Manhattan magistrate signed off on their agreement Tuesday and sealed it from public view.

Evangelista, one of the biggest names in modeling in the late 1980s and early '90s, reached the pact Monday with Pinault, who runs a luxury-goods conglomerate and is now married to actress Salma Hayek.

The settlement came in the midst of a trial that delved into their finances and personal lives, particularly the cost of living for the model and her son as she initially asked for $46,000 per month from the boyâ€™s father.

The trial forced both to testify in open court about touchy subjects, ranging from Pinault discussing Hayek's difficult 2007 pregnancy to Evangelista talking about how much she still commands for modelling jobs.

Evangelista, 46, went to court for 
Tuesday's brief session and stayed silent as she left, wearing 
leopard-print pumps and a modest black suit. Pinault, 49, wasn't there, 
though he had been for the other days of the trial, which started 
Thursday.

Evangelista had 
said in court papers she spends $46,000 a month on armed bodyguards, a 
24-hour-a-day nanny and other expenses for the boy, whose formal name is
Augustin.

Pinault, who makes about $4million a 
year, had said through lawyer David Aronson that he was willing to pay 
some support but not a potential $46,000 a month.

The intercontinental twosome dated - 
sporadically, Pinault said - over about four months in late 2005 and 
early 2006. Augie was born in October 2006.

After
Pinault told Evangelista he didn't plan to raise the boy with her, she 
willingly paid all the expenses herself at first from her roughly 
$1.8million-a-year income.

But
a big contract with L'Oreal ended in the last year or so, and she now 
needs Pinault to chip in, her lawyer, William Beslow, said during the 
trial.

In spite of the widely-reported figure, her lawyer said she wasn't asking for any particular amount.

Fashion: In her prior court appearances, Evangelista opted for more feminine looks

Pinault
is CEO of PPR, a holding company that owns Gucci, Yves St. Laurent, 
Bottega Veneta, Boucheron and other fashion lines. Forbes estimates his 
family's net worth at $13 billion.

He and Hayek married in 2009 and have a 4-year-old daughter, Valentina. He also has two children from a previous marriage.

The
Canadian-born Evangelista is a Vogue cover model many times over, 
including on the current Italian Vogue. She was among the high-wattage 
guests at Monday's night's Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute 
gala, one of the fashionable events on the society fund-raising 
calendar.

At the height of 
her career, she famously said supermodels 'don't wake up for less than 
$10,000 a day,' a remark she has insisted was a joke.
