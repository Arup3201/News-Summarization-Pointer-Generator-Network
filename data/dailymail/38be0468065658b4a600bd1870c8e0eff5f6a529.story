Tottenham attacker Erik Lamela was spotted with a tattoo of a football on his left shin while training ahead of his side's Europa League match against Partizan Belgrade on Thursday.

The Argentina international was on the training field as manager Mauricio Pochettino put his side through their paces before their European game at White Hart Lane.

Lamela scored one of the goals of the tournament in Tottenham's 5-1 win against Asteras Tripolis in October, and will be looking to get on the scoresheet again as Tottenham look to step closer to the knock-out stages with a victory.

Pochettino's side is second in Group C with eight points from four games, but they have had a harder time in the Premier League so far.

They sit 10th following an underwhelming start, but showed their character in a comeback 2-1 victory over Hull on Sunday.

Pochettino will no doubt be hoping that proceedings will be a lot safer on Thursday, with the help of compatriot Lamela.
