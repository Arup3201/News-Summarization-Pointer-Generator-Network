Matching his World Cup screamer, the golden boy of Australian soccer  Tim Cahill has added yet another notch to his impressive career after scoring one of the finest goals ever seen in Australia last night.

Surrounded on each side by Chinese opponents, the Socceroo flipped his body away from the goal in an iconic bicycle kick, four minutes into the second half, and blasted the ball overhead into the corner of the net from close range.

The star forward's goalscoring rampage put Australia through to the semi-finals in a 2-0 win over China in Brisbane.

Matching his World Cup screamer, the golden boy of Australian soccer Tim Cahill has added yet another notch to his impressive career after scoring one of the finest goals ever seen in Australia last night

Cahill  scored both goals in Australia's 2-0 triumph against China in Thursday night's quarter-final.

He has made a habit of scoring stunning goals for his country -- most memorably his volley against the Netherlands in last year's World Cup -- but Thursday's eye-popper was perhaps his finest. 

The first goal was a Cahill trademark after Ivan Franjic  headed the ball into the box in the direction of Cahill, who seemingly had nowhere to go with a defender breathing down his neck.

But the 35-year-old, displaying the sort of athleticism of a teenager, leapt into the air and performed a perfect overhead bicycle kick, angling the ball across the six-yard box past the astonished Chinese goalkeeper Wang Dalei.

The second saw Cahill jumping high, heading past a despairing and diving goalkeeper. 

Both stunners came in a 17-minute span in the second half as Australia cracked China's great wall of defence to secure a semi-final in Newcastle next Tuesday.

Most likely, they will confront defending champions Japan, who are favoured to overcome United Arab Emirates in a quarter-final on Friday.

With Cahill on their side, anything is possible for the Socceroos who, despite undergoing regeneration, still rely on their peerless 35-year-old hero.

Cahill's brace was justly rewarded with a standing ovation from the 46,067-strong crowd in Brisbane when he was substituted, job done, in the 80th minute.

Cahill was among seven changes to the Australian starting line-up as coach Ange Postecoglou deployed his heavy artillery.

The ins don't come any bigger for the Socceroos and also included captain Mile Jedinak, Robbie Kruse, Mathew Leckie and Mark Bresciano, who was given his first start of the tournament.

The Australians dominated a scoreless first half against a Chinese outfit content to sit back and look for counter-attacking opportunities.

By halftime, the Socceroos recorded 77 per cent possession and 296 passes to China's 85 - yet for all that, each nation logged two shots on target for the half.

Australia couldn't convert their two gilt-edged chances - a thundering Leckie left-footer and a Trent Sainsbury free header from close range.

As so often in the past, they needed a killer punch - and Cahill duly delivered.

His wondrous 48th minute scissor-kick came as his marker, Chinese captain Zheng Zhi, lay on the ground, felled in a tangle with Cahill for a corner.

The post-tangle rebound sailed to Ivan Franjic who headed hopefully back in Cahill's direction.

In an instant, Cahill perfectly summed up the situation and launched into a right-footed scissor-kick for a goal that ranks alongside his celebrated volley goal in last year's World Cup fixture against the Netherlands

His second was more common: finding time and space in the box, Cahill sweetly nodded in a Jason Davidson cross.
