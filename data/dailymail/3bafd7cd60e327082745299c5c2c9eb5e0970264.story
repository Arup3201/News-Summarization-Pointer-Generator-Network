West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has warned his high-flying players he will not tolerate any big-headedness following their impressive start to the season.

The Hammers, who face Stoke on Saturday, are currently fourth in the Barclays Premier League table following an excellent start to the campaign.

West Ham’s start to the season has come as a surprise to some, with the Hammers tipped to struggle this season.

Diafra Sakho has made a fine start to his West Ham United career with seven goals in as many starts

But a raft of summer arrivals including seven-goal Diafra Sakho, Alex Song, Enner Valencia and Cheikhou Kouyate have so far quashed fears of another season battling relegation.

However, Allardyce has fired a warning shot to his players, saying: ‘It’s not difficult for me (to ignore the praise) but sometimes the players find it a bit difficult.

‘I said to the players don’t start reading about yourself too much or else we’ ll have to start changing the size of the doors to get their heads through.

‘So keep your feet on the ground and don’t read too much praise about yourself like you shouldn’t read too much of the criticism.

Alex Song produced a commanding performance in West Ham's midfield as they beat Manchester City

‘You play it for the enjoyment and the praise that you get but make sure you manage it and control it well.

‘We have got to maintain it and our levels of performance. That is my responsibility because we have not been tested like this before and it’s about whether we can sustain this success.

‘Even last year when we had our darkest moments and we came out of it and won four on the trot and then lost four on the trot.

‘We have got to find that level of sustainability and consistency in our levels of results and performances. They have got to find out and I have got to find out if we are capable of that.’

Sakho will be given until Saturday morning to prove his fitness to Sam Allardyce ahead of the Stoke clash

Allardyce added: ‘As a manager, sustainable progress is what it’s all about.

‘You can be too slow and lose your job and then too quick and falter and then lose your job. If you build slowly and steadily and success is improved year in, year out then you can eventually get to stage where West Ham becomes like an Everton is at the moment.

‘That’s not only sustainability but looking at cup competitions and winning a trophy and getting into Europe and that can happen in this season and in the next two or three years perhaps depending upon the investment and the improvement of the squad.’
