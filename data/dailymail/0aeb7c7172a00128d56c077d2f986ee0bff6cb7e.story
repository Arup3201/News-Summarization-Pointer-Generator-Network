Hot food bought from bakeries and supermarkets is to become more costly thanks to George Osborne's Budget, it emerged today.

The Chancellor has decided that VAT at 20 per cent should be added to all hot takeaway food, not just products sold by fast food chains.

This means that at the Greggs bakery chain 18p will be added to the price of a 90p hot sausage roll and 30p to a £1.49 pasty.

The revelation came as millions of pensioners counted the cost of Mr Osborne's £3.5billion tax grab.

The 'takeaway  tax' means the price of a £5 hot rotisserie chicken at a supermarket will rise by a £1.

Mr Osborne said the extension was among a number that were necessary to end anomalies.

His decision will raise an extra £125million this year and £350million a year by 2016.

The Government insists the new regime will simplify the tax rules surrounding take-out food.

However, a guidance note issued by Whitehall suggests it may fuel confusion.

The note states that 20 per cent VAT will have to be added to all hot food, including rotisserie chicken, pies, pasties, toasted sandwiches and other products which are ‘above the ambient air temperature at the time they are provided to the customer’.

This means anything that is hotter than the surrounding air temperature when it is handed over at the till should carry VAT.

However, the same note to retailers states that a shop can sell a selection of cold sausage rolls, pasties or cooked chicken, which are below the surrounding air temperature, without applying the sales tax.

But the main focus of the Budget has been the so-called 'granny tax'.

The Treasury was taken aback by the strength of the backlash against Mr Osborne’s decision to freeze or axe tax allowances to be able to raise threshold at which workers start paying income tax.

The
tax raid, described privately by some Tory MPs as a serious political 
mistake, overshadowed other measures in the Chancellor’s widely trailed 
statement.

So strong was the reaction that Mr Osborne was forced to go on a charm offensive this morning to explain his position.

He toured television and radio studios
to defend his reforms against accusations he was penalising millions of
pensioners while some of the country’s richest people would enjoy a cut
in taxes.

He said: 'We’ve tried to spread the 
burden as fairly as possible across the income deciles. We’ve definitely
focused our efforts on the top 10 per cent and the richest 10 per cent 
have had more loss as a percentage of income as well as absolute 
amounts.

'Inevitably when you are saving 
welfare, you affect people in receipt of welfare. But it is improving 
their work incentives as well. We are trying to sort out a welfare 
system where it didn’t pay to work.’

Other VAT changes announced by the 
Chancellor will see the sales tax applied to sports drinks in the same 
way that it is already charged on sugary fizzy drinks.

In
future self-storage firms, which effectively rent secured rooms for 
people to store their belongings, will have to add VAT to their service 
charges.

At the same time, hairdressers who rent a chair in a salon will have to pay VAT on the fee, which will be passed on to customers in the form of more expensive cuts.

The new regime comes into effect in October.

Audrey Fearing, VAT partner at Ernst & Young, warned: ‘Consumers can expect to see the cost of some of their favourite hot pies, pasties and the like jump by 20 per cent.’

Greggs condemned the move, saying: ‘We
do not believe that our freshly baked savoury products should be 
subject to VAT and we will be making strong representation to the 
Government regarding the proposed changes.’

Among
the changes buried in the Budget smallprint is the decision that VAT is
also to be added to the cost of alterations, such as extensions, to 
listed buildings including churches. Treasury documents suggested that 
at least some of this increased cost to churches would be offset by 
improvements in government grants.

Greggs
reported profits of more than £50million in both 2010 and 2011. The 
results were due in part to a rapid expansion that has seen the bakery 
chain increase its number of stores. It now boasts nearly 1,500 outlets 
in the UK – more than McDonalds. There are plans for the figure to reach
2,000.

In 2009, a study found that annual sales of pies nationwide had reached £941million.

The Chancellor made a series  of bold statements during his Budget address. 
Here, JAMES SLACK  examines whether he was giving the public the full 
picture.

Claim: Cutting the top tax rate from 
50p to 45p will cost only £100million. ‘The new taxes I’ve introduced on
the rich today directly raise five times that amount.’
Reality: The actual cost of cutting the top rate of tax to 45p is 
£3billion. The Chancellor assumes he will get £2.9billion of this  back 
from people who – because of the high rate – currently avoid paying all 
the tax they owe. Labour says it is a huge gamble to assume that the tax
cut will make people change their behaviour. If less than £2.9billion 
is recovered, the central claim – that, overall, the wealthy will pay 
five times more than the cost of cutting the 50p rate – collapses. 
Experts say that it is inevitable the wealthy will find ways of seeking 
to avoid his two new taxes, on expensive properties registered overseas.

Claim: 'Some would have been tempted 
to spend the windfall (from the transfer of £28billion of assets from 
the Royal Mail pension fund to the Exchequer). I do not propose to 
spend it. Instead, I have used it to pay off debt.'
Reality: A disingenuous statement. The pension fund may have £28billion 
of assets – but it also has crippling historic liabilities of around 
£37.5billion. In effect, Mr Osborne has saddled the country with an 
extra £9.5billion of future debt. In a sleight of hand, only the assets 
of the fund are included in the  Treasury accounts. The liabilities – to
be met by future generations – are not.

Claim: ‘Over time we will simplify the
tax system for pensioners by doing away with the complexity of the 
additional age-related allowances...It is a major simplification. It 
saves money. And no pensioner will lose in cash terms.’
Reality: Pensioners will consider these weasel words. Age-related tax 
allowances will be frozen – and stopped altogether for anyone turning 65
after April 5, 2013. This means that, every year, they will lose their 
value in real – rather than cash – terms.  An estimated 4.41million 
people will be worse off, by an average of £83, in real terms in 
2013-14. People turning 65 next year will lose up to £322.

Claim: ‘We have...scrapped the last Government’s fuel duty escalator of 
annual above-  inflation rises, regardless of the oil price – and are 
today confirming the fair fuel stabiliser. Government has eased the 
burden on motorists by £4.5billion at a time when money is very short.’
Reality: The Freight Transport Association says the stabiliser is a 
‘damp squib’ as it only serves to prevent prices falling too low, not 
soaring too high. It stops way short of demands for a proper stabiliser 
which means duty would fall when the price of oil rises, and vice versa.
The increase in fuel prices since 2010 has put on an extra £14.46 for 
petrol and £17.60 for diesel each time drivers fill an  average tank.

Claim: ‘We’re publishing our plans today to remove loopholes and 
anomalies (in VAT), but we keep the broad exemptions on food, children’s
clothes, printed books and newspapers.’
Reality: From now on, VAT will start  applying to hot food bought in 
supermarkets,  such as roasted chickens, sausage rolls bought from 
bakeries and sports drinks, along with  holiday caravans, and the rental
of hairdressers’ chairs.  There will be further VAT rise of over 
£350million a year starting on October 1, 2012.
