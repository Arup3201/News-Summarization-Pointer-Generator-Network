Paedophile Gary Glitter may be arrested over claims he raped a 13-year-old girl in Jimmy Savile's dressing room at the BBC.

The 68-year-old former pop star, who was convicted of possessing child porn in 1999 and found guilty of molesting a pair of girls aged ten and 11 by a Vietnamese court in 2006, faces police questioning over a woman's claim she saw him rape a teenager in the 1970s, according to The People.

A source told the paper that Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, will almost certainly be contacted by police, who know the identity of the alleged victim.

The source added: 'These are very serious offences and as long as the woman gives evidence to the police there is a very good chance Glitter will be nicked.'

Earlier this week Karin Ward made claims that she was abused at 14, along with two fellow pupils of Duncroft Approved School for Girls, the Surrey school where Savile is accused of preying on under-age girls.

She told ITV News the three girls were taken to Savile’s dressing room at BBC Television Centre after being invited to London by the DJ in the 1970s.

She recalled: ‘I saw Gary Glitter have sex with a girl in Jimmy Savile’s dressing room...in that little alcove bit. I didn’t see it completely but that’s what was going on and nobody batted an eyelid.

‘Jimmy Savile had a (14-year-old) girl on his lap and he had his hand up her skirt. The girl Gary Glitter was having sex with also came from Duncroft. I think she might have been not quite 14.’

Scotland Yard is looking into numerous allegations from men and women about Savile, who died last year at 84. A spokesman said: 'We do not comment on who we may or may not want to question.'

Former detective Mark Williams-Thomas, who was behind the ITV documentary that first exposed claims of Savile's child abuse, told The Sun that a number of BBC staff knew about the abuse but did nothing to stop him. He is urging them to come forward and tell their story.

He said: 'There are clearly people who knew what he was up to. Ultimately those people now have to ask, 'Did I do as much as could with what I saw or heard?

'I do feel we've lifted the stone. Now there is a need to properly investigate.'

Mr Williams-Thomas also called Savile 'manipulative' and used his position and public image to gain access to and groom children.

'He would tell the girls he could get them jobs in media and get them on the radio and television,' he said.

'That was incredibly powerful for the children.'

He is now investigating a soap star in a separate investigation sparked by information he has received since the Savile allegations came to light.

The BBC released a statement saying it is helping police officers with their enquiries.

Miss Ward also claimed that she was groped by a drunken Freddie Starr in Savile’s dressing room, prompting Starr to make a statement angrily refuting the claim.He said: ‘I feel deeply sorry for them (his alleged victims) for having to go through what that scumbag put them through, I really do care for them.

Prime Minister David Cameron today called for allegations of sexual abuse against former DJ Sir Jimmy Savile to be fully investigated.

Mr Cameron said that the claims from a number of women which have emerged over recent weeks that they were abused by Savile as teenagers were 'truly shocking'.

And he said that the allegations should be looked into by the BBC - which employed Savile at the time - and, if necessary, by the police.

Mr Cameron told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: 'I think it is pretty shocking, the allegations that we are reading. They need to be properly looked at, properly investigated.

'It seems to me it is very important that the organisation, the BBC, does that itself.

'But also, if there are questions that should be pursued by the police and other organisations, everyone has to ask themselves the question: 'Is there new evidence that needs to be looked at?'

'But from what I have read - and that is just as a consumer of the media - truly shocking things have been said.'

'Don’t f******g tar me with the same brush as Jimmy Savile or Gary Glitter. If there is one thing I’ve always hated it’s paedophiles''If I see something on the TV about a kid getting hurt, I just have to turn it off.'

It has also emerged that a new footpath named in honour of Jimmy Savile only last month was stripped of its connection with his tarnished memory yesterday.

Workmen moved in yesterday morning to remove the two cliff-top signs directing visitors to Scarborough seafront along Savile’s View near the star's former flat on the Esplanade.

Police had stepped up patrols around the footpath leading down to the resort’s Spa Bridge following a vandal attack on the gold coloured “bling” plaque outside Savile’s former home in Wessex Court.

The plaque which was daubed with the words 'rapist' and 'paedophile' has also been taken down after Savile’s former neighbours threatened to take a sledgehammer to it.

Security has also been tightened around Savile’s £4,000 memorial in the Scarborough cemetery amid fears the grave will be the next target.

The previously unnamed path that Savile used regularly on his jogs around the South Bay was renamed only a couple of weeks ago.

When the allegations became public, the resort’s Jimmy Savile Memorial Committee set up to honour his name was bullish that the star’s reputation would ride out the storm.

But growing public anger has forced the committee to back-peddle and a sister project of raising thousands of pounds to create a life-sized statue of Savile has also been scrapped.

TV and radio presenter Sandi Toksvig has told how she was groped on air by a "famous individual" 30 years ago.

Ms Toksvig, who declined to name the celebrity, said when she informed other staff what had happened they thought it was funny.

The disclosure came as she reviewed the newspapers for the BBC's Andrew Marr show.

Questions have been raised about the culture at the corporation in the 1980s after allegations emerged about the late Sir Jimmy Savile's conduct.

Ms Toksvig, who starred in children's shows such as ITV's Number 73 during the 1980s and is now a regular on Radio 4, said the claims about abusive behaviour came as no surprise.

She said: 'In the 80s, which is when I started in radio and television, things were very different. Not to name any names, but I was once very unpleasantly groped while I was broadcasting by a famous individual who shall remain nameless.

'When I told the staff afterwards what had happened everybody thought it was amusing. There was a sort of 'shrugged shoulder' approach to the whole thing.'

She added that allegations of inappropriate behaviour 'did not surprise me at all and I had heard those stories when I was working at the BBC'.

Former Radio 1 DJ Liz Kershaw described last week how she was routinely groped by a colleague.
