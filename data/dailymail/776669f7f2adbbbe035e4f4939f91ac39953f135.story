The world's most expensive stamp, with a rich and colourful history, was displayed in London today ahead of its $20 million (£12m) later this month.

The only surviving 1856 one cent magenta from British Guiana has rarely been seen since it was last publicly exhibited in 1986.

On each of the three occasions it has been sold at auction, the stamp has set a new world record and it is expected to set yet another high when it goes under the hammer in New York on June 17.

The unique stamp is expected to fetch $20 million when auctioned in New York on June 17

An employee of Sotheby's auction house holds a case containing the sole-surviving 'British Guiana One-Cent Magenta' stamp dating from 1856

The sliver of paper - which was shown 
off at the London base of Sotheby's today - is estimated to sell for 
between $10 million and $20 million.

It
 was found by a 12-year-old Scottish boy living in British Guiana, South
 America, who saw it as a nice addition to his stamp collection in 1873 
when he found it among family papers, but had no idea that even at the 
time it was a rare find.

He 
sold it for a small sum later that year and within five years it was in 
the care of the renowned collector Count Philippe la Renotiere von 
Ferrary, an Austrian nobleman.

After
 he bequeathed it to a Berlin museum, it was seized by France in 1920 as
 part of First World War reparations from Germany and then sold on to a 
New York textile magnate.

Frequently described as 'the most valuable stamp in the world', the British Guiana 1c Magenta, pictured, will be auctioned in New York on June 17

The stamp was initially discovered in 1873 by a 12-year old Scottish boy living in British Guiana, South America who sold it to a local stamp collector for several shillings

It
 eventually ended up with John du Pont, heir to the chemical company 
fortune which bore his name, who bought it in 1980 for a then record 
price which would be equivalent to around £560,000.

The
 director of special projects at Sotheby's, David Redden, said of the 
stamp: 'I have been with Sotheby's all my working life, but before I 
knew about the world's greatest works of art, before I knew about the 
Mona Lisa or Chartres Cathedral I knew about the British Guiana.

'For
 me, as a schoolboy stamp collector, it was a magical object, the very 
definition of rarity and value, unobtainable rarity and extraordinary 
value.'

In March, the Expert Committee at the Royal Philatelic Society London gave the stamp a pre-sale estimate of between $10 million (£6 million) and $20 million (£11.8 million). The last time the world-famous stamp was examined was in 1935, pictured, and it has been in private collections ever since

The 1c Magenta was part of an emergency shipment commissioned by the country's postmaster when a delivery from England was delayed. This range also included the 4c Magenta, pictured, and the 4c Blue, and all the stamps were printed by the local Royal Gazette newspaper
