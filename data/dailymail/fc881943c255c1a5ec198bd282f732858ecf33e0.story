An American filmmaker who was held in solitary confinement in Libya's most notorious prison for months has told of his harrowing ordeal, now that he has been released.

Matthew van Dyke, a 32-year-old from Baltimore, was close to suicide after spending six months in a cell measuring 7ft by 4ft at Tripoli's Abu Salim prison - where, in 1996, Colonel Gaddafi had ordered the massacre of 1,200 prisoners.

Just as the revolution against they Libyan tyrant's 42-year rule was beginning to gather speed, he was caught up in the paranoia of the man known as mad dog.

Looking pale and thin, the bearded American filmmaker is coming to terms with his six months in solitary confinement in a Libyan jail

One minute he was taking a photograph of a man serving coffee in the small north-eastern town of Brega, and the next he was being hauled into jail by government forces, where a man was being loudly tortured in the room above him.

And now, with Colonel Gaddafi seemingly defeated and Tripoli liberated, Mr van Dyke, who said that his Christian faith helped him though the ordeal, has been freed and can tell his story.

When a crowd wrestled open his tiny cell after six months he feared it was an angry mob who thought he was a CIA spy and would lynch him.

But, to his relief, it was rebels and prisoners breaking him out of Abu Salim prison at the end of last week.

Mr van Dyke was captured in March by government soldiers and, after being interrogated in a basement in Brega overnight, he was then held incommunicado for six months in Tripoli

'I was in solitary confinement the whole time with nothing to do but stare at the wall,' the now lanky and bearded man said.

He described the months of enforced isolation with nothing to do as a kind of 'psychological torture'.

He didn't even realise when his 32nd birthday came and went and, to distract himself, he read the ingredients on the milk cartons he received with his meals.

Now that Colonel Gaddafi appears to have been defeated Mr van Dyke has been freed

'When I got a German milk box somehow that had five languages on it, that was quite a treat,' he said. 'Keep that one and try to learn words in various languages - anything to break the monotony of staring at a wall.'

His only human interaction was with the 
guards that brought him his food, though when he was transferred to Abu Salim in Libya's capital, all they did was slide his plates through a 
metal slot.

'It does incredibly unbelievable things - I'm still coming to terms with what I went through,' he said.

'It's absolutely shocking. I'm not really ready to talk about the extent of what went on psychologically to me.

'I would rather they [the guards] had just taken me 
out and beat me, even every day, than go through the solitary 
confinement, because what it does psychologically is astonishing.

'I had 
no idea that the brain could work in the ways that it did in my case.'

The filmmaker, who had just finished travelling from Iraq, through Iran and into Afghanistan by motorcycle, had not even visited the North Africa country to work - rather, he was visiting friends.

A top security prison in Tripoli, Libya which is often described as 'notorious' and a 'site of egregious human rights violations' by human rights activists and other observers, Abu Salim was where, in 1996, Human Rights Watch believes that 1,270 prisoners were slaughtered.

Some say that Western governments largely ignored this and no international inquiry was launched, due to 'oil interests'.

The Libyan government said that the killings took place amid confrontation between their forces and rebels from the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, and that some 200 guards were also killed.

But he figured that Gaddafi's men thought that he was an American spy, or a member of the CIA, and thought he would be cut off from society for decades, with no one - his family or loved ones knowing whether or not he was dead or alive.

He was riding in a pickup truck through Brega, snapping pictures, when a 
surprise advance by government forces caught him and his rebel friends 
unaware. He doesn't remember what happened next.

He had no media credentials and continued: 'I woke up in a cell with a man being tortured in the room above 
me.

'I thought I was [going to be] there for 20 to 30 
years. I knew I was in a lot of trouble and I knew they were thinking 
things because of the footage I was captured with, and that I was 
doomed.

'I was there and there wasn't going to be any reason why I was getting out.

'I thought it was over and I would 
never see my family again. One guy at the interrogation said, "You will 
never see America again," and I thought he was right.'

By the light of a cell skylight the size of a dinner plate, he recorded his days in solitary on the wall next to marks made by the cramped room's previous occupants. His row grew to two to three times the others.

'That's when I realised there was a big problem with my situation,' he said. 'Those cells seem designed either to 
temporarily hold people or to break their mind.'

Though he was allowed out of the cell 
three times a day to use the toilet and was given food such as bread and
 cheese, couscous, rice, pasta and chicken, he admitted that he manufactured a make-shift noose.

'I took yarn from the blanket and I 
made bracelets and a ball and a belt to hold my pants up, which was 
eventually taken from me because they thought I might hang myself with 
it.

'I also made it strong enough so it 
would double as a noose if I needed it, and I hid a plastic bag from 
them in case I needed it. In case I decided to take my own life, I 
wanted to have the means available to do it.'

And then, suddenly, it was all over - there were a series of loud noises and then he could hear a crowd breaking open the gates to his cell block.

As they bashed open his cell door he expected to be grabbed and murdered for being a spy, but instead they just moved on to the next cell.

'One guy said "Gaddafi is finished!" and I didn't believe it,' he said, and other prisoners hesitated to leave their cells, fearing it was some kind of trick.Â 

Mr van Dyke added: 'I said: "How [is Gaddafi finished]?" [One of the prisoners] said: "We don't know. We don't know. Let's go." So I took a chance and thought all right, let's go.'

When free he called Lauren, his girlfriend of five years, and his mother, Sharon, who had been lobbying hard for his release.

However, he does not want to return home to Baltimore until he discovers the fate of his three friends, whom he believes may be imprisoned in Gaddafi's hometown, Sirte.

'I told them: "I go home when Libya is free." And that's why I'm still here.'
