Two teens in Cypress, Texas believed to have been lured to San Antonio by a mysterious man they met on Facebook turn out to have planned the whole thing.

The families of 16-year-old Liana Andrews and 14-year-old Kacie Watson were reunited with their daughters Sunday after they and Andrews' mother's car were reported missing August 16.

Originally, they believed that the girls had been lured to San Antonio by a man named 'Shaun Hernandez' that they met on Facebook.

Runaways: Police found journals written by the two girls left at home which detail their escape. They also believe that they created a fake Facebook profile for a man in San Antonio to cover their real plan to go to Denver

But it turns out that the two girls created Hernandez' profile in an attempt to cover up their tracks and eventually run away to Denver, Colorado.

Their entire plan was written about in journals the two girls kept at their houses.

'They planned the whole trip,' Sergeant Doug Thomas told KHOU. 'We have two different journals - one from each girl. They planned down how far it takes to get from one city to the next. How much gas it takes and they even planned their potty breaks.'

For some reason they left these journals behind when they left. The journal entries don't explain why they wanted to go to Denver or for how long.

For the entire week that they were missing, their families made public appeals on TV and held vigils at local churches, praying for the girls' safe return.

'This is not a runaway case,' said Liana's mother Lana Turner in a press conference last week. 'My daughter and her friend are in danger. I know that and I want them found.'

Eventually their plan faltered when the car they were driving was impounded. Andrews' mother had reported it missing so it was towed.

Distraught: Liana's mother Lana Turner was convinced that a man named Shaun Hernandez had lured the two teens to San Antonio and that they were in danger

Discovered: The girls' plan fell apart when their car was impounded after it was reported missing. They were eventually found panhandling for money in a San Antonio parking lot

Investigators believe they left all of their belongings in the car, not knowing that it would be impounded.

Desperate for money, the two girls were reported panhandling on a Walmart property in San Antonio.

On Sunday, they were returned to their families. Neither will be charged as it's not against the law to runaway in Texas.

Sgt Thomas has been investigating missing children cases for 10 years, and he says he's never seen a case like this.

'It was every time we turned the page - we always scratched our heads and couldn't figure out why you would do that.'
