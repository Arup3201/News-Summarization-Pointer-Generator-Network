The number of Geisha – traditional Japanese female entertainers who act as hostesses – may have declined since the 1800s.

But more people could enjoy the company and musical skills of such hostesses, if Toshiba’s realistic ChihiraAico robot, unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, catches on.

Like a Geisha, the robotic hostess named ChihiraAico is designed to make conversation, sing and could one day play classical music or look after people.

The robotic hostess, named ChihiraAico, is designed to make conversation, sing and could one day play classical music or look after people.

'Her' unnervingly smooth and silent body movements are created using 43 pneumatic actuators including 24 in its shoulders, arms and hands and 15 in the face.

The Japanese firm told Mashable that its aim is to create ‘real heart-warming communication with human-like facial expression’ with its realistic, conservatively dressed android. 

Toshiba claims its creation has the most realistic facial expressions of any android.

'Her' unnervingly smooth and silent body movements are created using 43 pneumatic actuators including 24 in its shoulders, arms and hands and 15 in the face.

This technology is needed to reflect the robot’s emotions, as it can reportedly be happy, irritated or sad – and even cry.

ChihiraAico is the latest member of Toshiba’s ‘human smart community’ – a group of robots designed to lead to smarter living.

In the future, the company envisions that such robots could look after the elderly, work as nurses or waitresses, meaning that they could one day put humans out of a job.

ChihiraAico is not the only android that could replace humans. 

Chillingly life-like robots are causing a storm in Japan, where their creators are about to launch them as actresses, full-size mechanical copies for pop idol fans, and clones of the dearly departed.

There is even talk that the naturalistic, she-droids may be taken up as men as partners in the not-too-distant future.

Android Asuna was a star attraction at Tokyo Designers’ Week showcase in November and is one of a series of 'geminoids', as their inventor dubs them, that are ripe for commercialisation say their creator robotics professor Hiroshi Ishiguro.

The prospect of robot overlords, friends and lovers has been the topic of science fiction novels for years.

But according to one mathematical model of how our brains create consciousness, emotional machines will never exist.

This is because computers can't handle any process that completely integrates information, so they cannot be conscious and capable of feeling, one expert claims.

A mathematical framework for consciousness, developed over the last decade by Giulio Tononi at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, shows that computers cannot handle the complex processes needed to mesh pieces of information together seamlessly.

This means, if consciousness is based on the integration of lots of pieces of information, computers can’t be conscious and capable of experiencing emotions like humans.

‘She’ is so convincing that many people bowed respectfully before requesting politely to take her photo or join a selfie at the event.

While the robot currently relies on a hidden camera and a human operator to give her life, a fully independent version is expected in 10 years using artificial intelligence, face and voice recognition.

Asuna has silicon skin covering animatronic muscles that move her eyes and power her expressions.

'She' has appeared on stage and in an opera and could become a pop star.

Already Japan is in thrall to virtual idols such as Hatsune Miku, who is basically a hologram that 'sings' words and music created for her on a computer using 'vocaloid' technology. Her tunes often outsell those sung by her flesh and blood musical rivals in Japan.

And as well as robotic news readers, realistic sex dolls are now available.

Costing around £6,000, they have moveable eyes, flexible fingers and realistically textured skin.

One of the manufacturers, called Orient, said: 'It is not inconceivable that we will be making android life partners in the near future.'

In the future, Toshiba envisions that ChihiraAico and other similar robots could look after the elderly, work as nurse or as a waitress, meaning that she could one day put humans out of a job. Japan already has a robotic newsreader (pictured)
