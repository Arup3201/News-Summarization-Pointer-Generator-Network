Tickets for the official Diamond Jubilee Pageant party alongside the River Thames are being offered for up to 40 times their £5 face value.

The charity event in Battersea Park has the support of the Queen and is timed to coincide with the Royal River Pageant.

As many as 90,000 people are expected to attend, with money through the pageant and associated events supporting the Thames Diamond Jubilee Foundation.

Royal rip off: Tickets for the Jubilee Pageant are being offered on eBay for up to 40 times their original price

The foundation is a privately funded 
charitable trust which aims to raise funds for projects that have a link
to The Queen with a particular focus on youth and education.

The
prices were deliberately kept to a modest figure of £5, which covers 
administration costs, to ensure the maximum number of people would be 
able to take part.

At the same time, any children under 13 will be allowed in free provided they are accompanied by an adult.

However,
the tickets sold out weeks ago and eBay is peppered with auctions by 
individuals who are trying to cash in on the popularity of the Queen by 
selling the tickets at a huge mark-up.

One listing is offering four adult tickets with a face value of £20 for £800.

What they're paying for: More than 1,000 boats are due to follow the Queen and Royal Barge for one of the largest flotillas ever assembled on the river

The listing makes clear that the 
focal point of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Festival in Battersea Park is
the opportunity to view the Royal Flotilla on the Thames.

More than 1,000 boats are due to follow the Queen and Royal Barge for one of the largest flotillas ever assembled on the river.

The sale of the tickets was handled 
by the Ticketmaster agency and are sold as eTickets, which means those 
looking to cash in can simply forward them to buyers to be downloaded 
and printed at home.

Unscrupulous: Individuals are trying to cash in on the popularity of the Queen by selling the tickets at a huge mark-up

A spokesman for the Thames Diamond Jubilee Foundation hit out at those trying to make profit from the royal fervour.

‘It
is disappointing that tickets, for what is both a charitable event and a
national celebration, are being re-sold in this way,’ she said.‘Unfortunately, the Thames Diamond Jubilee Foundation has no control over the reselling of tickets.

‘Although the Battersea Park event is now sold out, we urge anyone who wishes to experience the Pageant to come and watch from the riverbank, or on one of the giant screens. 

This great day out is entirely free of charge.’The official charitable partner of the pageant is the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust, whose chairman is the former prime minister, Sir John Major.

Sir John stressed the events are an opportunity for people to raise money for charity and support causes that are close to the Queen’s heart.

‘The Trust’s purpose is to honour and commemorate The Queen’s unrivalled contribution to the Commonwealth and intends to fund projects that will enrich the lives and opportunities of all Commonwealth citizens,’ he said.

‘It is our hope that individuals, 
organisations and countries will all wish to contribute to the Trust, as
a tangible and enduring way of honouring HM The Queen, and to 
demonstrate the enormous respect and affection in which she is held, not
only within the Commonwealth family, but also the wider world.’

Royal Barge: The Queens Barge Gloriana is moored at Richmond upon Thames in south west London. It will follow the Spirit of Chartwell in the Flotilla

Preparations: Narrowboats due to join the Royal Flotilla arrive in British Waterways' West India Lock

Finishing touches: A pair of red-velvet thrones - poorly concealed beneath transparent plastic sheeting - are the giveaway to the magnificent Queen's Barge

The Battersea event has been co-curated by designer Wayne Hemingway. It will feature music, theatre, design, art, film, fashion and food from the past 60 years.

The park will be divided into zones including a Coronation bandstand tea dance with live big bands swing, jive and lindy hop, 1952-themed bars and the food flavours of the Coronation Year.

The main stage will feature six concerts to represent the six decades of the Queen’s reign.

There will also be The Diamond Geezer pop up pub, with Pearly Kings and Queens, sing-a-longs and traditional pub games.
