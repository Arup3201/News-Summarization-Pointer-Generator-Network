The wink is back - and so is the leadership speculation. 

Last year Prime Minister Tony Abbott copped a battering after famously winking at an ABC radio presenter while talking to a sex worker and now he has done it again.

In an interview where a Liberal voter laid into him on Melbourne's 3AW this morning, Mr Abbott was pictured reviving the facial twitch that got him into so much trouble.

His interview with Neil Mitchell was an otherwise unpleasant experience for the Prime Minister, who faced questions over whether his leadership is at stake.

He's done it again: The Prime Minister winked at another caller on Melbourne radio this morning

A self-described Liberal voter, 'Andrew', told the nation's leader: 'You're the world's worst salesman.' 

'You’re on the nose with Liberal voters - that’s a real concern to me, because I don’t want to see you give the keys to Bill Shorten at The Lodge.'

More significantly, he was forced to hose down speculation that he might not lead his party to the next election as he is so unpopular.

'That's nonsense, absolute nonsense,' he said, after he was quizzed about whether his government was in strife. 

He said one lesson learned from the previous Labor government - racked by leadership tensions - is that you rally behind someone and do not change leaders.

Mr Abbott, pictured, was forced to hose down leadership speculation on air

'You do not change leaders... you stick to the plan' Mr Abbott told Radio 3AW in Melbourne, where he was quizzed on whether his government was in strife.

Some MPs told Fairfax newspapers the party room was in 'anarchy' following a procession of policies that have failed to get traction. 

The Age quoted an unnamed senior Liberal MP saying Mr Abbott had  "lost the respect" of some colleagues.

Another was quoted saying he had 'just months' to turn things around.   

Just last week the Federal Government was forced to back down on a plan to introduce a $20 cut to the Medicare rebate for short consultations.

The measure could have caused doctors to pass the cost on to consumers.
