A host of new changes are being made by Penn State administrators in an effort to show that the school is moving past the trial of former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky where he was sentenced to jail for abusing multiple boys both in and out of the football team's showers.

Loyal fans may still carry out the tradition of dressing in white for games and coming early to the school's Beaver stadium to cheer on the team, but they won't find themselves screaming the lyrics to Neil Diamond's hit Sweet Carolina as they have for many seasons past.

Given some of the song's provocative lyrics- which include 'touching me, touching you'- athletic officials decided to keep it off the pep band's playlist for the upcoming season.

No more singing: Penn State will not blast Sweet Caroline during football games anymore because of the potential for double entendres in the wake of the sex abuse scandal that rocked the athletic program

In the wake of the scandal that erupted following the discovery that Sandusy sexually abused up to ten young boys, university officials are taking decisive steps to steer clear of any double entendres.

Local paper The Altoona Mirror reported the playlist update as the school released the details about changes fans can expect when they attend games this coming season.

Sweet Caroline has been played regularly at the team's home games for years, and Penn State was not alone as the song is also favored by the Boston Red Sox, the University of Pittsburgh, and Denison University.

Diamond's hit, which has an unusual story
 behind it as it was inspired by a picture he saw of President John F. 
Kennedy's daughter Caroline when she was 11-years-old, is not the only 
one that devoted fans will miss this season.

NBC Sports
 reports that the 1972 hit Rock And Roll, Part Two will not be played 
either, as it was made famous by British singer Gary Glitter. Glitter 
was arrested in the late 1990s for possession of child pornography and 
committing obscene acts with minors in Vietnam a decade later.

In addition to musical changes, an 
updated roster, new coaching staff and alternative pre-game strategy 
will also greet the fans that turn up to see how the team fares after 
they were given extensive NCAA penalties.

team's 'new era' that could include a uniform shake up. The iconic

Scandal: The announcement comes after Penn State opted to remove a statue of once storied and now shamed former head coach Joe Paterno and the ex-assistant coach Jerry Sandusky's guilty verdicts

The
 so-called Nittany Lions have been banned by the governing authority 
from making it to any bowl games for the next four years, have been 
ordered to pay a $60million fine, and had all of Paterno's wins stripped
 from their record dating back the 1998 when Sandusky was originally 
investigated internally over one instance of sex abuse.

The
 team will be lead onto the field by new coach Bill O'Brien, who 
formerly worked for the New England Patriots, and they will be sporting 
their names on the backs of their jerseys for the first time ever- a 
move which the coach hopes will help show they are in a 'new era'.

'We've
 got a group of young men there, like I said, that are sticking 
together. And there's changes that have taken place at Penn State over 
the last six months that are reflected already,' he said in a press 
conference late last month.

For years, Neil Diamond kept quiet about what inspired his 1969 single, but he decided to break his silence in 2007.

He said that when he was struggling 
musician, he saw a picture of then-first daughter Caroline Kennedy 
taking a stroll on her horse. At 
the time, she was 11-years-old.

'It was a picture of a little girl 
dressed to the nines in her riding gear, next to her pony. It was such 
an innocent, wonderful picture, I immediately felt there was a song in 
there,' he previously said.

In spite of his assertions, some lyrics are slightly unseemly given the age of the inspiration.

Aside from the 'hands, touching 
hands, reaching out, touching me, touching you' portion of the song 
which Penn State officials took issue with, another portion could also 
be considered objectionable.

Later in the song, he sings 'Look at the night / And it don't seem so lonely / We fill it up with only two'.

It was only in 2007, when he sang the
 hit via video stream at Ms Kennedy's 50th birthday that he revealed the
 former first daughter as the inspiration.
