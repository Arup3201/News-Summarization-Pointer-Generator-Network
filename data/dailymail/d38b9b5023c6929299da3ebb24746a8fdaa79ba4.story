Elizabeth Rowland, from Fleckney, Leicestershire, is the first person in Britain to undergo the procedure

A woman of 84 has become the first in Britain to be implanted with a next-generation artificial heart valve.

Before having the new valve fitted, Elizabeth Rowland was so ill from the common heart condition aortic stenosis - in which the main valve becomes thickened - that she could barely walk. But she is now back on her feet and in need of less medication.

At present 5,000 Britons a year have valve replacements, but the new Lotus implant vastly reduces the chance of blood leakage and life-threatening complications.

The valve is fitted using keyhole surgery under local anaesthetic, meaning that frail patients - such as Elizabeth - don't have to undergo a risky and invasive open-heart operation.

Made of a metallic mesh and titanium, the new valve is about the size of a 10p piece.

'The Lotus valve offers such precision and control that it's  like the difference between landing a plane with or without the help of autopilot,' said consultant cardiologist Dr Jan Kovac, who carried out the operation at Leicester's Glenfield Hospital.

'You are able to place it precisely where you need it. This valve is also much more sophisticated in that you are able to move it as many times as you like until you're completely happy it's in the right position.' A special seal in the system also reduces the risk of Paravalvular Leakage - a potentially life-threatening complication where blood leaks between the implant and the heart tissue. It is one of the main causes of death from the procedure.

Elizabeth, from Leicestershire, said: 'I'm so pleased to have had this operation - it has given me a new lease of life.

'I can move about more and I don't need quite so much medication. The care I received was excellent, too - everyone was lovely. I'm pleased to be one  of the first in the UK to have had this procedure.'

In spite of the intricacy, Elizabeth's keyhole operation took  just 40 minutes. Dr Kovac made an incision in her groin, then threaded a balloon catheter (a narrow tube pre-loaded with the prosthetic valve) up through the femoral artery into her heart. The catheter allowed a balloon to be placed inside the aortic valve to stretch it open and create space for the new valve to be inserted.

Once the valve was in the correct position, the balloon was deflated, allowing the new valve to start working straight away. Dr Kovac manipulated the position of the replacement valve with a control handle attached to the balloon catheter.

Approximately three per cent  of the population over 65 and five per cent of people over 75 suffer from aortic stenosis.

The disease stiffens the heart's main aortic valve and prevents it from opening and closing as it should. That restricts blood flow into the main artery that takes blood into the body.

While mild narrowing of the valve may not produce symptoms, severe narrowing can cause shortness of breath, chest pain  or tightness, and dizziness or fainting. Left untreated, it can lead to heart failure and sudden death. The most common cause is deposits of calcium building up.

Dr Mike Knapton, associate medical director of the British Heart Foundation, said: 'The Lotus System is an exciting technical breakthrough. This is the next generation of valves for a pioneering technique that means frail and elderly patients who wouldn't survive open-heart surgery can have the procedure.

'The new valve has a better adhesive to stop leakage around the sides and it has been developed so that its fitting can now  be done with much more precision. It's amazing that we're now able to replace the aortic valve so well.'
