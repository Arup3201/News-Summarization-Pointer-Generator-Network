A Memphis mall exploded into chaos Saturday evening as five men carrying sledgehammers stormed in, bashed a jewelry case and stole nearly three quarters of a million dollars worth of watches.

Witnesses described a total madhouse as the thieves made their way to the Reeds Jewelers in the Wolfchase Galleria after 7pm and sent terrified shoppers fleeing for the lives.

The thieves clad in hooded sweatshirts made off with an estimated $715,000 worth of Rolex watches stashed in pillowcases and were believed to still be on the run as of Sunday afternoon.

Heist: At a Reeds Jewelers just like this in the Memphis shopping mall Wolfchase Galleria, five men wielding sledgehammers swooped in Saturday evening, smashed jewelry cases and made off with $715,000 worth of Rolexes

'We were just downstairs and heard two pops I think, and everybody just started running,' witness Darius Martin, who was at the mall with his brother Deonte Martin and friend Carlos Hunt, told WMCTV.

But when the young men first heard the commotion, they actually ran toward it. 'We thought it was a fight or something,' explained Deonte.

But the group didn't get much further.

'And my friend said just turn around turn around, because he heard somebody say they got a gun. So we turned around, ran back up the steps and ran out the door,' Deonte said.

Chaos: The heist went down around 730pm and witnessed describe a madhouse as shoppers fled for their lives and the thieves stuffed all the watches they could carry into pillowcases and escaped through two different exits

Conflicting accounts were rampant following the heist but police eventually said no firearms were, in fact, seen by witnesses.

But that didn't keep them from scattering as the culprits stuffed their sacks with all the watches they could carry and bolted through two different exits.

The men had yet to see justice as of Sunday afternoon, which at least one witness found almost impossible to believe.

'It's crazy, it don't make sense,' said Hunt. 'There's so many people around that saw it.'
