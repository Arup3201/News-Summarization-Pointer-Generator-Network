It wouldn’t be April without showers – and the heavens will duly open to spoil the Easter weekend.

While the gloomy forecast will dampen spirits, it will be welcomed by water companies desperate for rainfall.

But anyone hoping for a relaxation of the hosepipe ban will be sadly disappointed, as experts warn it would take more than a month of heavy rain to replenish water levels.

Forecasters predict cloudy conditions and patchy rainfall today and tomorrow, followed by wet and windy weather on Monday to complete a washout Easter weekend.

They have also warned that winds of up to 40mph could hit south-west  England and south Wales on Easter Monday, with gusts felt across most of the country.

Met Office forecaster Michael Lawrence said: ‘It will become increasingly unsettled over the bank holiday weekend.

‘There are clouds moving down from the north and by Saturday there will be considerable cloud and we’ll see patchy light rain and drizzle.

‘We’ll see plenty of April showers and average temperatures and rainfall for this time of year, with a few dry intervals.’

He added: ‘By Monday the whole country is going to see wet and windy weather with frost and some snow in the Scottish mountains.

‘It will not be a very nice day. There will be occasional heavy rainfall which will be useful for some. ‘Temperatures will be near average for this time of year. The rest of the month will be unsettled with showers and rather cool with overnight frost.’

There was cold comfort yesterday for those who travelled early to the south coast to beat the bank holiday traffic – particularly campers.

Overnight temperatures plummeted to -4C (25F) at Bournemouth Airport.

That made the resort one of the coldest places in the country, though it warmed to 10C (50F) by lunchtime.

By Monday, high winds could hit areas 
including Devon, Cornwall, South Wales and Anglesey as a result of a 
low-pressure system coming in from the west coast, according to 
forecasters from the MeteoGroup.

It means the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge might be affected if they are at home in Anglesey.

The forecast of wet and windy weather 
will be welcome news for water  companies, though they warned that only 
sustained rainfall will help replenish low stocks.

Mr Lawrence added: ‘March was  very 
dry. April is likely to have  average amounts of rainfall. But a wet 
month won’t help water  companies or save the public from a hosepipe 
ban.

In fact, April is not even wet so far. It’s just average.

‘It will take far longer to replenish the water supplies than just one rainy month.’

A spokesman for the Environment Agency
said: ‘The forecast wet weather will be particularly welcomed by 
gardeners in drought-hit areas.

‘But we can’t make up for the past two
dry winters with just a few days of rain and it won’t stop the impact 
of the dry weather becoming more apparent across England and Wales.

‘We’re continuing to monitor the 
situation closely and it’s vital that all of us – from householders to 
businesses, farmers and water companies – play our part by using water 
wisely.’
