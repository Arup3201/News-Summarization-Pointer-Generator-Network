An 18-year-old man who went on the run with his underage girlfriend has pleaded not guilty to statutory rape after claiming that he did not know the girl was just 13.

Dalton Hayes was transported back to Grayson County, Kentucky on Thursday after he and the girl were arrested in Panama City, Florida on Saturday following their crime spree across six states.

He was emotional as he appeared in court, where he pleaded not guilty to charges including burglary, theft, trespassing, criminal mischief, rape and custodial interference, WAVE3 reported.

Hayes is being held on a $250,000 full cash bond at the Grayson County Detention Center.

Emotional: Dalton Hayes, 18, appeared to be crying as he appeared in court in Grayson County, Kentucky on Thursday for his arraignment. He pleaded not guilty to eight charges, including rape

His girlfriend and alleged victim, whom DailyMail.com is not naming because she is a minor, is also back in Kentucky and is being treated by the courts as a juvenile, WAVE reported.

After she was reported missing on January 3, the couple eluded authorities for two weeks.

They allegedly stole three trucks - including one with two guns inside - trashed one of the vehicles, and cashed stolen checks on their spree across Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida.

They were eventually found sleeping in one of the trucks in the parking lot of a Florida IHOP late on Saturday night and taken into custody.

Speaking from jail this week, Hayes explained that the night before they vanished, they had been at a party with the girl's mother, who does not have custody of her.

Afterwards, they stayed at Hayes' home and the next morning they awoke to calls saying the police were looking for the girl because she should not have been with her mother, he said.

Defiant: In jailhouse interviews (right) Hayes has claimed that he thought his girlfriend was 18, not 13

Girlfriend: He had been dating the girl for about three months before they went on the run together on January 4. Her identity is being concealed because Hayes has been charged with a sex offense and she is a minor

'She said "I'm not going home, I hate it at home",' he recalled, NBC reported. 'She said, "I'm going to run." I was like, "I can't let you go by yourself so I'm gonna go with you". So I went with her.'

He added that the girl's father did not have to call police because he knew she was with him. Her father has denied any suggestion that she was abused at the home.

The girl's mother also appeared in Grayson County District Court on Thursday on a charge of custodial interference for picking up the girl on January 3. She is being held on $50,000 bail. 

In previous jailhouse interviews, Hayes has claimed he did not know the girl - whom he had been dating for three months - was just 18 until she was reported missing. 

'I asked her how old she was and she said she was 18 for the longest time,' he told WMBB-TV.

'I kept asking her old she was. She kept telling me 18 almost 19. She told me she had a truck, had a license, all that good stuff.'

'Crime spree': The duo led police on a chase across six states until they were caught last weekend. Here, they are pictured in a Walmart in Manning, South Carolina, where they allegedly cashed stolen checks

Stopped: They were eventually found sleeping in a stolen truck in an IHOP parking lot in Florida on Sunday

At one point in their relationship, she even told him she had been pregnant, he said.

'We were fighting and arguing again and she said, "by the way I had a miscarriage, I just didn't know how to tell you",' he said. 'And I said, "all you had to do was just tell me something".' 

The duo fled from their small Kentucky town the day before Dalton's charges in a separate burglary case was scheduled to go before a grand jury.

He was facing five to ten years in jail after being charged with second-degree burglary - and he said he wanted to show his girlfriend the sea before being locked up, friends told DailyMail.com.
