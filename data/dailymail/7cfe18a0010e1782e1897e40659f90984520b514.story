Nico Rosberg has joked that he will pay for Valtteri Bottas to enjoy a spa session  in  hope that the Williams driver will ‘do the impossible’ and finish ahead of Lewis Hamilton at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Rosberg will start the final race of the campaign from pole position after blowing away Hamilton at the Yas Marina Circuit on Saturday. 

But in order to emulate his father Keke and be crowned world champion, Rosberg needs Mercedes team-mate Hamilton to finish outside the top-two. Bottas starts third.

Rosberg was in imperious form on Saturday, beating Hamilton to pole by almost four tenths of a second 

Hamilton will start in second. If he finishes there he will be crowned the 2014 Formula One champion 

Speaking after qualifying, a jovial Rosberg said: ‘I am sure it is going to be a great battle between the two of us, but I hope for more than that.

‘I am paying for a wellness night for Valtteri, a spa session, all-inclusive, hoping that he can be in extra special form and do the impossible tomorrow.

'Valtteri said he got his perfect lap together, so there wasn’t anything else in that. Of course it would have been great if somehow there could have been a Williams between the two of us, but that can always happen tomorrow.' 

Hamilton was the best part of four tenths of a second slower than Rosberg despite appearing to hold the advantage over his team-mate during the early part of qualifying.

But the British driver, who is bidding to claim his first title in six years, made a number of errors during the top-10 shootout and never troubled his rival. 

'I generally didn’t have the best of laps but it was still a really good qualifying session, I really enjoyed it and the car was fantastic,' he said. 

'Of course you always want to be on pole, that’s what we work for. I’ve had very good pace throughout practice and particularly the long runs which is comforting.

'I didn’t really put a comfortable lap together but it wasn’t really lots of mistakes or anything, it just wasn’t a great lap. Nico did a great job but we’re still there for the fight tomorrow.'
