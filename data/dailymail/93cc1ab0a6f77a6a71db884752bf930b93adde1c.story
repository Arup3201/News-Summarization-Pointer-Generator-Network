An NYPD Officer who was named the 'Cop of the Year' at his precinct in Queens two years ago, has been arrested for allegedly buying cocaine in Florida.

Philip LeRoy, 28, was busted – along with two other men - just before midnight on Monday in Sunrise City, Florida.

The trio were allegedly trying to buy 10 kilos of cocaine and LeRoy, the son of a former detective, had his off-duty gun on him at the time.

LeRoy has been charged with felony weapons possession, cocaine trafficking and conspiracy to traffic cocaine, report the New York Post.

The disgraced officer, who works in the 114th Precinct, is currently in jail awaiting formal charges - something which could take state prosecutors up to 21 days.

Bail was set at $250,000 and he was suspended by the NYPD early on Tuesday. 

Two years ago, LeRoy was picked from more than 100 officers in his precinct to win its 'Cop of the Year' award.

'As a member of the anti-crime unit, P.O. Leroy has made more than two dozen arrests so far this year for things like robbery and gun possession,' said then-Police Commissioner Ray Kelly about LeRoy. 

The officer joined the NYPD in January 2009 and had racked up 188 arrests up until June 2012.
