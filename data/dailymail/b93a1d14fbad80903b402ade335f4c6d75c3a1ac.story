In the 1990 Tim Burton film, the character of Edward Scissorhands is seen to have a talent for topiary, wielding his hands to create impressive sculptures in his new neighbourhood.

But even these creations may be beyond his skills, with the best plant artists in the world gathering in Montreal to show off their designs.

Gorillas, monkeys and a line of lemurs are among the entries in this year's Mosaïcultures Internationales de Montréal.

The elaborate sculptures see horticulturalists letting their imaginations run wild, including rock pools and colour as well as creating the shape of creatures and people

Horticulturalists pick colourful foliage - and even paint the leaves - to complete their designs for the triennal competition

The horticulturalists battle it out to choose the best foliage to create living exhibitions - even painting the plants as part of the look.

The triennial show began in 2000 with entries representing 35 cities from 14 countries.

Now, more than 100 cities from 25 countries are taking part and their entries will be on display in the Canadian city until September 29.

The stunning array of designs feature 22,000 plant species and cultivars in ten exhibition greenhouses and 30 themed gardens.

These hulking gorillas are made from living and growing plants with their chests, hands, feet and faces moulded out of plastic as an addition to the design

The competition may remind some of the spectacular creations made by Johnny Depp's Edward Scissorhands in the 1990 Tim Burton film

The theme for this year's event was Land of Hope, with entrants asked to incorporate something from their own country with an environmental concern such as an endangered species

The theme for this year's event is Land of Hope, which asks competitors to design something that represents either nature in the city, endangered species or ecosystems, peace, positive action to help the environment or how man and nature are dependent on one another.

Charles Lapointe, president and CEO of Tourisme Montréal, said: 'I am absolutely thrilled that show has returned to make Montréal blossom in 2013.

'It goes without saying that the beauty of these original works by talented horticultural artists will not only captivate local Montrealers, but will also serve to attract visitors from around the world.'

The endless 50ft designs - including a chameleon, frog, family of chimpanzees, water buffalo and herds of animals - will become a key attraction in the city for the summer.

Some artists created plants out of plants, with this entry showcasing tall flowers with large petals and leaves on their stem

Mosaïcultures Internationales is a chance for the representatives from parks, gardens and green spaces around the world to exchange ideas as well as a competition and exhibition.

All the entries must match up to standards for sustainable development and can promote an attraction within their cities.

Organisers predict that more than a million people will visit the displays, which are expected to bring in about $46million to the province of Quebec.

They say that mosaiculture is different from topiary because artists create something new out of foliage and plants, whereas topiary involves pruning shrubs into shape.

Artists were free to interpret the Land of Hope theme from looking at how humans interact with nature to highlighting endangered animals or ways to protect the planet

Some sculptures stand as high as 50ft depending on how ambitious the horticulturalists were with their subjects
