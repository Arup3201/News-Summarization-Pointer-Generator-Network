Ben seemed to be in good spirits in his Instagram post on Sunday, adding the quote, 'As Mark Twain once said —''Reports of my dearth have been greatly exaggerated (sic)".

He was also the recipient of support from his friends and family, including Big Brother winner Tim Dormer, Ben’s close friend and fellow Big Brother housemate, told Daily Mail Australia that he hasn't spoken to Ben yet but offers him his support during this difficult time.

‘I’m really shocked and saddened,’ the 30-year-old told DMA.

‘I know Ben has been suffering with depression and anxiety for a long time and I’ve shared that journey with him for the last year since Big Brother.’

‘It’s really sad when people who are suffering with depression feel that there’s no one else out there because there’s a lot of people,’ he continued.

‘I’ve known Ben has a lot of people that care about him,’ he said of his good friend, revealing he communicated with Ben just hours before he was admitted to hospital.

He said he spoke with Ben on Friday and he 'seemed fine.'

Hoping to speak to Ben again when it is possible, Tim said simply checking in with his mate and reassuring him is his biggest intention.

When asked what he will tell Ben, the 2013 Big Brother winner said he’d ask Ben ‘How is he going’ before telling him ‘I’m always here for him when he needs me’.

After hearing the news of his overdose, he posted an image of the pair together on his Instagram feed.

'Thinking of my mate and hoping to hear from him soon,' Tim wrote.

'Sending love and light'.

'Greatly exaggerated': Ben took to Twitter to make a brief statement

Big Brother host, Sonia Kruger has been in contact with Ben and sent him her love, telling DMA: 'Ben is part of the Big Brother family and always will be. We have been in contact with Ben and he is recovering at home and has requested his privacy. We are here to support Ben on his road to recovery.' 

Fellow Big Brother housemate Tahan Lew who spent time with Ben in the Big Brother house told Daily Mail Australia: 'I have reached out to Ben but like I said to him I know I can't say or do anything to help him.'

'I wish I could but this is something he needs to be strong about and fix on his own with the help of professionals but I did let him know I am there for him if he needs or needs me to do anything,' she said.

'I just hope he can get the help he needs.'  

Last month, the lovable TV personality spoke to Daily Mail Australia about his struggles with depression and coming to terms with his sexuality and mental illness.

'I don’t know whether I’m happy with my life,' he admitted at the time.

'But it’s fuller and I don’t feel so alone. That’s the great thing about owning something, it allows other people to come forward.'

He said going on Big Brother helped him to vocalise his depression, which made him feel like isolated.

Telling messages: Ben has been open about his struggle with depression, even posted though provoking pictures to his social media accounts

'I struggled in the Big Brother house - Australia saw that.

'It did help though, because acceptance and love is not something I've been showered with in life, and that’s no reflection on my family... who was gay, anxious and a vegetarian in the 90s?

'I grew up just thinking that I was a criminal because you could go to jail for being gay until I was in year 12.'

The former housemate has spoken about his battles with mental illness extensively in the past year, revealing that his diagnosis lead to discrimination in the workplace: 'I used to just make a joke and fob the question away, as I was too embarrassed to admit, anxiety and depression got the better of me in the workplace.'

He was referring to a Facebook post in which he said Virgin Australia had dismissed him from his post because of his condition.

He said: 'The main reason I broke my silence (some of you already knew) on how I left Virgin, was that many lovely folks stop me in the street and kindly ask me if I'll ever consider returning to flying, sometime in the future.

'I used to just make a joke and fob the question away, as I was too embarrassed to admit, anxiety and depression got the better of me in my workplace.

'I then felt like I was lying to myself and lying to all of you by not telling you the full story. I pride myself on being genuine & honest and Mum has always said, 'The truth shall set you free'.
