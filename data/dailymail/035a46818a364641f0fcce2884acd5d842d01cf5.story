Back to court: Casey Anthony seen leaving the Orange County Jail after acquitted of murder in July of 2011, may soon return to court on a defamation charge

Casey Anthony will be denied a fair trial if it's not moved from its current venue in Central Florida, her attorneys said this week.

In paperwork filed this week her attorneys asked to have the trial moved out of Orange County arguing that Anthony would not receive an impartial jury due to pretrial publicity.

Anthony was acquitted last year of murder in the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, a ruling that sparked outrage and even death threats against the now 26-year-old spanning across the country.

Her attorneys argue 'the local media refuses to move on' and that the public feels as though 'justice was not served' in the criminal case, the Orlando Sentinel reports.

After Caylee disappeared in the summer of 2008, Anthony first told investigators that a babysitter named Zenaida Gonzalez had kidnapped the toddler.

Ms Gonzalez later sued Anthony, claiming her reputation had been ruined.

Seeking punitive damage against Anthony, Ms Gonzalez’ Attorney John Dill said he does fully expects to hear 'Miss Anthony has no money,' but they plan to seek 'the source of the Casey Anthony trust fund,’ along with ‘any income from any book deals or publicity.'

'Today's hearings were not all that significant,' Anthony's attorney Andrew J Chmelier told the media outside the courtroom, 'but certainly we're obligated to make objections when we think they're appropriate.'

The lawsuit is set for trial in January.

'We're subpoenaing here, we want her to be there, we hope she'll testify,’ said Mr Dill.

Mr Chmelier disagreed suggesting that her safety may prove otherwise.

'Her safety is a primary concern, above anything that happens here, we have a duty and obligation to make sure that she is safe,' he said.
