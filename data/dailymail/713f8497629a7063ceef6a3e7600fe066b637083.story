Some of the more surprising destinations across the country attracting many of the thousands of migrants making their homes in the UK have been revealed in latest Government figures.

Although London still remains the biggest draw for most people looking to relocate to the UK, areas including Warrington, Hull and Peterborough are proving to be draws for certain nationalities.

And while the figures suggest Polish people, the biggest single group of migrants during 2011-12 with almost 80,000 settling in the UK, seem to like Northern Ireland, Bulgarians tend to head for Herefordshire and Zimbabweans apparently prefer Leicester.

Government figures have revealed the cities and towns across the UK where thousands of migrants are making their home

The figures came out in Department for Work and Pensions data which showed where 600,000 migrants applied for a National Insurance Number to work or study, the Sun has reported.

The data suggested while Poland had the largest number of migrants to the UK, there was also 47,270 Indians and 38,300 from Pakistan.

Elsewhere, Birmingham was not surprisingly a big draw, being popular with migrants from China, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and the African state of Eritrea. According to the figures, migrants from China were also keen on Glasgow.

Meanwhile, many of the 33,190 Lithuanians who arrived in the country opted for Peterborough and a large number of Iraqi migrants chose Hull, in Humberside.

Warrington, in Cheshire, was also popular with many Slovak migrants.

Polish migrants also settled in Ealing, West London, while nearby Brent was a popular destination for 
Romanians, Hungarians and Portuguese.

Those coming from Australia 
gravitated towards Hammersmith and Fulham, while South Africans and New 
Zealand migrants preferred Wandsworth.

Meanwhile, Americans tend to go to Westminster or Kensington and Chelsea, according to The Sun.

The figures were published at a time 
of increased political tension over immigration, amid fears of a 
large-scale influx of Bulgarians and Romanians next year.

Transitional arrangements in place 
since 2005, which restrict the rights of 29million Bulgarian and 
Romanian citizens to live and work in other EU states, will expire in 
December.

Campaign group MigrationWatch has claimed that as many as 250,000 could arrive over the next five years.

Last month the Daily Mail reported how the Coalition had rejected figures, compiled under the Labour government, which suggested the number of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants expected next year was just 12,700.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said the estimates, revealed after months of cover-up by ministers, were drawn up by Labour after comparing the two countries to Poland, which has sent around one million people to the UK.

The document predicted just 4,613 Bulgarians, out of a population of 7.5million, will come to Britain every year, along with 8,156 Romanians – a tiny fraction of its 21.4million inhabitants.

Addressing Westminster journalists, Mr Pickles said he had ‘no confidence’ in the figures and that was why ministers chose not to publicise them, though he said they were slipped out on a Whitehall website in 2011.
