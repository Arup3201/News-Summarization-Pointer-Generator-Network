Scary Poppins: Evelyn Pillow, 85, described by a neighbor as caring and polite, has been convicted of assaulting a baby boy while caring for him last September and sentenced to 400 hours of community service

An 85-year-old Virginia nanny has been convicted of assaulting an infant she had been babysitting.

Evelyn Faye Pillow appeared in Henrico Circuit Court Friday, admitting that there was sufficient evidence to convict her on a misdemeanor assault charge.

The abuse occurred last September while the octogenarian was caring for a little boy.

Medical experts were prepared to testify that the months-old child showed classic signs of shaken baby syndrome.

As part of the plea agreement, Pillow was ordered to perform 400 hours of community service.

She also received a 12-month suspended sentence and was barred from being alone with children.

Mrs Pillow, of Highland Springs, called 911 in September 2013 to report that the baby boy in her care was unresponsive.

The infant suffered damage to his eyes and brain, but according to his family he has since recovered.

The victim’s loved ones sat in the courtroom Friday, many of them in tears, as Evelyn Pillow learned her fate, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported.

Deputy Commonwealth’s Attorney Nancy Oglesby delivered the family's impact statement, saying that for the first 24 hours after the assault the child's condition was touch-and-go, and that no one knew at that point if he would ever wake up. 

The little boy spent five days in the ICU before he was cleared to return home.

Oglesby told the court that the child showed signs of prior brain injury inflicted upon him within the time frame of his care by Pillow, but there is no proof that the 85-year-old nanny was responsible for the trauma.

The news came as a shock to Pillow's next-door neighbor William Lynchesky, who said the 85-year-old was like a grandmother to him.

‘She watched my child for about four years straight and she still sees my daughter whenever we can,’ he told CBS 6.

Describing Pillow as caring and very polite, Lynchesky suggested that perhaps there is more to the story than the public is being led to believe.

‘She’s a good woman and I think that something like this might have been a mistake, or something bad could have happened prior that we don’t know,’ he said.
