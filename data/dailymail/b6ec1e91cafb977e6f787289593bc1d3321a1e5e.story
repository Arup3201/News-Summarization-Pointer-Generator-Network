A transgender woman is suing for the right to have free breast cancer screenings after being turned away by a clinic for not being 'genetically female'.

Jennifer Blair, 62, from Colorado, had gender reassignment surgery more than a decade ago and takes a daily dose of doctor-prescribed synthetic oestrogen.

After noticing an unusual breast growth, Ms Blair, who does not have health insurance, went to the Planned Parenthood centre in Denver for a mammogram.

The state-run clinic is funded by the Women's Wellness Connection and offers free cancer screenings for women on low income.

But Ms Blair was shocked to be told she could not have the mammogram because she was not born a woman.

'I was hurt. I'm a person just like anyone else,' Ms Blair told WUSA9.

'I have the same hopes, the same dreams, the same concerns as any other woman,' she added.

Ms Blair said that her daily intake of 
sex hormone Estradiol had increased her risk of developing a variety of 
tumours, including breast cancer, and believed her growth warranted further investigation.

A spokesman for The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, which funds the programme, said it only covers clients who are 'genetically female'.

But Ms Blair countered that after nearly 50 years of living as a male, it had not been an 'authentic' life and now describes herself as 'a real woman'.

'It's discrimination based on her 
transgender status. I think that's pretty black and white,' her attorney, Sarah 
Parady said.

Ms Parady filed the lawsuit, claiming Ms Blair's experience was in violation of the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act, adding it was a 'terrible injustice'.

Legal analyst Scott Robinson is now arguing for legislation as federal law on transgender issues is not clear enough.

Ms Blair has since raised the money to pay for a mammogram - and has found she does not have breast cancer.

Her legal crusade continues, though, 
as she does not want others in a similar situation to be denied such 
screenings, and wants to hold public organisations accountable.

The Colorado Civil Rights Division issued a written response, saying the state programme is only following CDC guidelines.

The
specifics of the lawsuit have not been reported. No one from CDC was 
available for comment due to the partial government shutdown.
