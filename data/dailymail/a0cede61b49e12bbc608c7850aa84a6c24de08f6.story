She's made the glamorous transition from Essex-born reality TV star to successful style and beauty entrepreneur in just a few short years - and there's no stopping Sam Faiers.

The 24-year-old has unveiled her second collection for online digital retailer, Very.co.uk, and proves her fashion prowess in the shoot.

Taking inspiration from styles she loves to wear herself, as well as key trends from the catwalk, Sam has curated - and modelled - her latest collection.

On-trend catwalk references include bold colours and chic coats, while flattering jumpsuits and ripped jeans are styles taken from her own wardrobe.

The 12-piece collection also includes a classic navy suit, sugary pastel coat and a stripe outfit, all modelled to perfection by the reality TV star. 

Sam showcases her trim and toned figure in the new campaign, which is the result of her new fitness venture. 

Sam recently launched an exclusive website, Celebrity Training With Sam Faiers, packed full of tutorials, advice and tips she says will help you maximise your workout and achieve a healthy, strong and feminine dream body.

The 12-piece collection curated by the TOWIE star also includes a classic navy suit (trousers, £35, jacket, £55)

The former The Only Way Is Essex star has devised healthy alternatives to her favourite foods with the help of healthy eating specialist Sophie Bradshaw.

Diet-wise, Sam starts the day with an acai berry smoothie, has a sweet potato and carrot soup for lunch and a superfood kale and mushroom frittata for dinner.

Speaking to FEMAIL about her healthy new eating regime, she said: 'I also eat a lot of chicken for lunch and dinner and porridge for breakfast.

'With my Crohn’s I have to be careful with what I eat and Celebrity Training has a great healthy eating expert, Sophie Bradshaw, who recommends the best in healthy home cooking.'

The fitness fan admires Beyoncé, who she says 'works so hard for her body and looks healthy at the same time', as well as Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who she thinks looks 'fit and feminine'  (coat, £75)

One of her favourite meals is the almond and turmeric crusted chicken with parsnip fries - a paleo recipe

One of her favourite meals is the almond and turmeric crusted chicken with parsnip fries. Speaking about the dish, she said: 'This paleo recipe gives KFC a serious run for their money. 

'No joke - the chicken strips taste so good when coated with the almonds which act as breadcrumbs when baked in the oven. 

'The parsnips are just as delicious, and are packed with fibre to keep your digestive system happy and healthy. 

'This is a fabulous pre or post work out meal to fuel your body with packs of protein.

'Trust me, you won’t ever want to stop off for a saturated fat laden chicken and chips ever again. This is life-changing and so easy.' 

Speaking to FEMAIL about her latest venture, the businesswoman said: 'I have wanted to step into the world of health and fitness for a while now, as it’s a big passion of mine. 

'When I lost a lot of weight from my Crohn’s disease, I wanted to make a change and make sure that I was healthy, fit and feminine.

'My motivation is to show that you can keep your body in a healthy and strong place. This is far more important than what size you are. It’s about how you feel.'

Sam, 23, has launched health and fitness website Celebrity Training With Sam Faiers

TOWIE star Sam said that she always wanted to step into the world of fitness and when she lost  weight from the Crohn's disease diagnosed earlier this year, her priority was remaining healthy, fit and feminine

Sam is so convinced by the power of her programme that she uses it three times a week on her phone or iPad when she's travelling for work.  

She starts  with the warm up, Get Started,  and finishes with Cool Down. Then she alternates between the weights-based Get Strong routine and Get Focused, which includes targeted body exercises. 

The fitness fan admires Beyoncé, who she says 'works so hard for her body and looks healthy at the same time', as well as  Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who she thinks looks 'fit and feminine'.

And it seems Sam is aiming for the same level of success as the stars.

As well as her new range for Very, she last week launched her latest lash range, Lashes by Samantha.

Sam, pictured, left, in 2014, and, right, in 2011, admits she has felt pressure to lose weight in the past, particularly prior to her stint on Celebrity Big Brother because of all of the cameras in the house
