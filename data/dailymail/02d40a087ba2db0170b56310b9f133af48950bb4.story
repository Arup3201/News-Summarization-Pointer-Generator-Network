Police investigating a sexual assault on a sleeping train passenger have ruled out the man in a photo taken by the victim.

The 29-year-old woman, who cannot be named, was asleep on the 6.30am train from London Euston to Birmingham on February 15 when she woke to find a stranger groping her chest.

After leaving the carriage in shock she returned to take a picture of the man she said had attacked her.

Police say no further action will be taken against the man

The woman got off the train at the next stop and contacted police.

British Transport Police yesterday released the image three months afterÂ  the attack.

The passenger then came forward and was interviewed by British Transport Police in relation to the alleged incident.

Today, a statement from BTP said: 'Following CPS advice, no further action will be taken against the man and the case is now closed.'

The attack took place on a service that left London Euston at 6.30am on February 15 and was travelling to Birmingham
