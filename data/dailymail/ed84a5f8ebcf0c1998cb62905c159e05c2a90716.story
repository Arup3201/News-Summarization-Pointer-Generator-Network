Luis Suarez made the extraordinary claim to FIFA’s disciplinary committee that he ‘did not bite or intend to bite’ Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini — but ‘fell’ into him.

And his refusal to accept responsibility for the offence or even to admit that it took place appears to have backfired and resulted in the severe sanction from FIFA — he is banned from all football for four months as well as nine international games.

Suarez’s defence will come as a further embarrassment and Liverpool are now preparing to sell the player to Barcelona. They are hoping to bring Chile and Barca striker Alexis Sanchez the other way as part of the deal.

Accident? Luis Suarez told FIFA he did not deliberately bite Giorgio Chiellini but fell on top of him

Big miss: FIFA have been formally informed of Uruguay's appeal against Suarez's ban

Time: The Uruguay football federation will now have a further seven days to prepare paperwork for the appeal

FIFA’s written reasons to the 
Uruguayan FA for the sanction emerged yesterday and the document quotes 
from Suarez’s explanation of the collision with Chiellini.

Suarez
 submission to FIFA said: ‘In the run-up to the impact, my knees came 
together, I lost my balance and that destabilised my body and I fell 
into my opponent. In that moment, my face came into collision with the 
player, causing a small bruise on my cheekbone and a lot of pain to my 
teeth, which caused the referee to stop play. That is what happened and 
in no event did I, as is written in the document, “bite” or “try to 
bite”.’

However, the 
attempt to deny the incident appears to have been an enormous 
misjudgment by Suarez and his legal team and resulted in a more severe 
sanction than if contrition been shown.

The
 FIFA disciplinary commission noted ‘at no point did the player show any
 contrition or repentance of any type, nor did he admit any violation of
 FIFA regulations and has therefore not shown any knowledge of having 
committed any offence.’

In 
applying the sanction, the committee considered ‘the grave danger of 
repetition, the exceedingly abnormal nature (of the offence) in the 
context of a football match and the intention to harm the opponent.’ It 
was also noted that he had been sanctioned previously for this offence 
in club football.

Suarez’s 
latest offence means he will have been banned for a total of 47 matches 
for three separate bites and racially abusing Manchester United’s 
Patrice Evra.

Last night, he
 made his first public comment since arriving back home in Montevideo, 
having been thrown out of the Uruguay camp by FIFA.

In a tweet, he said: ‘Hi all, I write this post to give thanks to the outpouring of support and love I am receiving.

‘Both
 myself and my family really appreciate it. Thank you very much for 
being by my side and I want all my colleagues today to know we support 
the national team for the match against Colombia.’

Painful: Suarez fell to the ground and held his teeth straight after the encounter with centre back Chiellini

Suarez
 will now leave Liverpool, with the Premier League club working to 
extract the best possible deal from a difficult situation.

The
 club will ask for £80million, although Barcelona and Suarez believe the
 transfer can be done for £65m, based on a buy-out clause. Nevertheless,
 Chile striker Sanchez could be key to negotiations. Barca are willing 
to sell him, Liverpool want to buy him but the player needs to be 
convinced and Arsenal are likely to bid, although they have not 
registered their intent as yet.

Liverpool will now begin a £120m rebuilding project to fill the void left by Suarez.

Adam
 Lallana’s £23m move will be announced tomorrow and the Belgian striker 
Divock Origi will join at the end of the World Cup for £10m — although 
he is expected to spend next season on loan with  current club Lille.

Liverpool
 will look to add £15m Southamton defender Dejan Lovren and £25m Benfica
 winger Lazar Markovic to their summer transfer spending, which has 
already included £9m for Emre Can and £4m for Rickie Lambert.

Liverpool will be forced to end up paying Suarez £3m in wages for doing nothing if they don’t sell him this summer.

The
 Uruguayan is occupying the minds of owner John W Henry and the 
Liverpool hierarchy as they work out what to do next with their troubled
 striker.

Last night, the Anfield club were poring over the FIFA ruling handed to them by Suarez’s lawyers.

The Premier League club has its hands tied, however.

Although
 the Uruguayan FA has handed in a formal appeal over  Suarez’s 
punishment, Liverpool will have to abide by FIFA’s final decision and 
cannot mount their own, separate appeal.

In
 addition, withholding Suarez’s wages while he is suspended from playing
 and training is not an option under agreements the Premier League has 
made with the Professional Footballers’ Association — and FIFA’s own 
rules.

Suarez took to Twitter on Saturday to thank his supporters and said: 'Hi all, I write this post to give thanks to the outpouring of support and love I am receiving.

'Both myself and my family really appreciate it. Thank you very much for being by my side and I want all my colleagues today to know we support seleccion for the match against Colombia.'

The maximum fine 
Liverpool can impose on Suarez, if they have a mind to, is two weeks 
wages, under contracts signed with the PFA.

Even
 if the players’ union gave them special dispensation to increase the 
fine because of the seriousness of his offence, Liverpool could not 
withhold Suarez’s money for more than two months without Suarez being 
free to  move to another club — something Liverpool would not 
countenance for such a valuable asset.

It
 leaves Liverpool having to decide whether it would be beneficial for 
the club to enter negotiations with Barcelona, who would like the player
 to form a dream attack with Neymar and Lionel Messi.

If
 an agreement for the player to move to Spain cannot be reached, 
Liverpool will have to pay Suarez’s £175,000-a-week wages until the end 
of October — amounting to £3million — even though the player cannot 
play, train with his team-mates or watch the team play.

Suarez
 may even choose to stay away from the country altogether and there are 
serious doubts about whether he will want to return to England while he 
is banned.

Even before his bite, the player had shown clear signs of wanting to quit the Premier League.

He
 and his family left their home in Woolton, Liverpool as soon as the 
final ball had been kicked at the end of the Premier League season in 
May.

By the time Suarez was awarded the prestigious Football Writers’ 
Footballer of the Year in London four days after the end of the league 
season, the 27-year-old was already in Barcelona where his in-laws live.

The trophy was collected by Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers instead.

Suarez’s
 comments after scoring twice against England in the Group D clash — in
 which he claimed that he had been ‘laughed at’ in England — were also 
seen  as stirring upanimosity and an indication of his desire to play in
 La Liga.

But Liverpool 
owner Henry showed last year, when he rejected out-of-hand Arsenal’s bid
 of £40m- and-a-pound for Suarez, that he will only let the player go to
 Barca if they meet his market value of around £70million — despite this
 third biting offence.

 Despite
 the furore surrounding Suarez, Liverpool are proceeding with plans to 
bolster Rodgers’ squad for next season when they will play in the 
Champions League after a five-year absence.

The
 protracted move for Lallana should be finalised and announced within 
the next 48 hours and the club also has an interest in Belgian striker 
Origi — who will be involved in his country’s World Cup quarter-final  
against USA on Tuesday.

Southampton
 defender Lovren, Serbian striker Markovic and Croatia winger Ivan 
Perisic, of German side Wolfsburg, are also being looked at while 
Rodgers has stated his intention to buy a left-back, too.

It is all part of Liverpool’s rebuilding plan that has been  complicated by Suarez.
