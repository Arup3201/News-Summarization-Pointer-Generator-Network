A police woman who once used a fake Facebook account to bombard an Aboriginal rights activist with racist taunts is standing to be a One Nation candidate for the upcoming Queensland election. 

Leanne Rissman made headlines in July last year when a police investigation found that she had hurled abuse at Geraldton's Joyce Capewell on her Facebook page, Boomerang Justice, using the alias 'Anne T Sharia'.

This comes as Queensland Premier Campbell Newman on Tuesday announced the state election will be held on January 31.

Ms Rissman joins the party which is being led by controversial political figure Pauline Hanson, who's known for her first parliamentary speech in which she warned of a country 'swamped by Asians'.

Leanne Rissman was disciplined by the Queensland Police Service after it was found she made racist remarks via an alias Facebook account

Ian Nelson, the Queensland director  for One Nation, confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that Ms Rissman is standing as the party's candidate but is yet to provide further comment.

Party leader Pauline Hanson returned to One Nation last year after being forced to quit in 2003 as she was found guilty of electoral fraud and sentenced to three years in jail, although the conviction was overturned and she was freed after 11 weeks.

Hanson is notorious for her first parliamentary speech in which she warned of a country 'swamped by Asians'.

On New Year's Day last year, Senior Constable Rissman referred to indigenous people as 'scum bags' and 'oxygen thieves' after Ms Capewell posted on her Facebook page about Tony Abbott's indigenous advisory council and what role they would play in looking into deaths in custody. 

'Get off your a*** get a job and start giving something back to your own and the greater community,' Senior Constable Rissman allegedly posted under the Anne T Sharia alias. 

Ms Capewell started Boomerang Justice last year after 20 years of working in the Western Australia prison system and interacting with Aboriginal inmates. The page aims to raise awareness about ongoing Aboriginal deaths in custody. 

'And while you're at it how about you give you children and dogs a decent existence as well instead of starving and abusing them.'

Ms Capewell said the barrage of racist comments continued after she contacted Anne T Sharia to ask her to stop posting the offensive remarks.

'Everything you have is because of the white man, if you hate it so much go back to the Aboriginal empire that existed before we came and saw you all sitting in the dirt rubbing sticks together while Rome was built, China built the magnificent great wall, and the English Spanish and Dutch traded and built empires,' Senior Constable Rissman allegedly wrote.

When sounded out phonetically 'Anne T Sharia' sounds like 'anti-sharia'. Sharia is the moral code and religious law of Islam.  

A police investigation was launched into Snr Const Rissman (left) after Geraldton's Joyce Capewell (right) lodged a complaint against her

Ms Capewell told Daily Mail Australia back in July that she was so offended by the comments she lodged a complaint with police that sparked an internal investigation into Snr Const Rissman.

An official document seen by Daily Mail Australia confirmed the Queensland Police established that the abuse allegations 'were capable of being supported'.

'I felt very horrified and lost faith in the police...[it] kept me wondering if this was the type of people we have working with Aboriginal people in custody,' Ms Capewell said.

'I don’t want this woman dealing with Aboriginal prisoners or any Aboriginal people for that matter.'

A Queensland Police Service spokeswoman confirmed an officer had been disciplined in relation to a complaint made by Ms Capewell in January.

'The remarks were considered to be racially offensive and although made by the subject officer off-duty were not consistent with the standards and values of the QPS,' she said.

'In response, the complaint was investigated by a senior officer and found to warrant significant remedial action.

'The officer was subsequently required to undertake a number of training programs relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People race relations and social issues as well as professional practice in the QPS and information security obligations.'

Daily Mail Australia can also reveal Ms Capewell has been attacked on Facebook by supporters of Senior Constable Rissman since Monday.

'Why don't YOU get your facts straight and stop terrorising a decent hardworking Australian citizen,' one wrote.

Another supporter also threatened Ms Capewell with legal action, writing: 'Please don't waste your time on this UNEDUCATED MORON. I hope she has a GOOD Lawyer because she's going to need one.'

Senior Constable Rissman is also under investigation for not complying with police standards in relation to the investigation into the bashing death of an indigenous woman named Adelaide Riversleigh, according to The Australian.

The 37-year-old died on May 10 after she was allegedly attacked by her partner.

A Queensland Police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia she could not comment on the matter because it was currently being investigated internally by the service.

The spokesman for One Nation also declined to comment on the investigation. 

A number of Senior Constable Rissman's supporters did not return messages seeking comment on the matter.

'All matters relating to this officer are being investigated by a senior member of the QPS from Northern Region with overview by the Ethical Standards Command,' the police spokeswoman added.
