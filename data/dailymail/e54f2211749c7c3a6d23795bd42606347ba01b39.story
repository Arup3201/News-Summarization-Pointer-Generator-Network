More than 20,000 inmates of North Korea's notorious Camp No 22 are feared to have perished during the regime's recent closure of brutal facility.

The Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (HRNK) claims the prisoners - most of whom have never committed a crime - may have been allowed to die of disease or starvation in the run-up to the camp's closure last year.

The organisation's latest report, North Korea's Hidden Gulag: Interpreting Reports of Changes in the Prison Camps, says the prison population shrank dramatically in the months leading up to December.

Brutal: Prisoners were often worked to death at the notorious gulag Camp 22 in North Korea

Missing: Thousands of prisoners are unaccounted for after Camp 22 was closed by Kim Jong-Un

According to a report on the Telegraph's website, defectors
 of the regime revealed about 8,000 of the 30,000 prisoners may have been 
transferred to other camps, leaving 22,000 unaccounted for.

The prisoners who survived are believed to have moved to Camp 25 near Chongjin City or to North Hamgyeong Province's 
Camp 16, about which virtually nothing is known.

The closure came as North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un consolidated his grip on power following the death of his father in 2011, Kim Jong-Ill.

Now the HRNK has called for an inquiry into their fate.

The report stated: 'North
 Korea's 2009 currency devaluation (whereby camp authorities were 
reportedly unable to purchase food in markets to supplement the crops 
grown in the camps), combined with bad harvests, resulted in the death 
of large numbers of prisoners after 2010,' the report states.

'If even remotely accurate, this is an atrocity requiring much closer investigation.'

While the report covers all of North Korea's gulags, it focuses a large part of its attention on the situation in Camp 22.

Secrecy: Camp 22 was believed to have been located in the North East of the country on the Chinese border

HRNK spoke to defectors, including former guards, and occasional camp survivors to compile the report. It also used satellite images.

Camp 22 is believed to sprawl across 770 square miles, making it larger than London.

HRNK estimates even after the closures of two camps, about 130,000 people are still being held in labour colonies across the country.

The report stated: 'Through this vast system of unlawful imprisonment, the North Korean regime isolates, banishes, punishes and executes those suspected of being disloyal to the regime.

'They are deemed "wrong-thinkers", "wrong-doers", or those who have acquired "wrong-knowledge" or have engaged in "wrong-associations".'

The report added: 'North Korea denies access to the camps to outsiders, whether human rights investigators, scholars, or international media and severely restricts the circulation of information across its borders.'

Few prisoners ever make it out to tell the tale. Those who have paint a bleak picture of life on the inside.

Inmates
 can be imprisoned for life along with three generations of their 
families. They are forced to survive by eating frogs, rats and picking 
corn kernels out of animal waste.

Human rights activists estimate 40 per cent of inmates die of malnutrition, while others succumb to disease.

They face abuse by guards, torture, sexual violence and can even be worked to death. Those caught attempting to escape are executed.

Roberta Cohen, co-chairman of HRNK, called for the International Red Cross to be granted access to the camps as soon as possible.

She said: 'An accounting of the fate and whereabouts of all of North Korea's political prisoners, including those missing and those who have died in detention, should be of highest priority to the UN commission of inquiry and the entire international community.'
