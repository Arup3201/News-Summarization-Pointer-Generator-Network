A Texas man was today convicted of murdering an Austin mother whose husband spent 25 years behind bars before he was exonerated of her slaying in 2011.

Jurors in San Angelo found Mark Alan Norwood guilty of capital murder for the 1986 beating death of Christine Morton, who was attacked in her north Austin home, and the 58-year-old was sentenced to life in prison.

Morton's husband, Michael, was initially convicted in her death in 1987, but he was exonerated and freed in 2011 after new DNA testing was done on a bloody bandanna found near the couple's home.

According to the San Angelo Standard-Times, prosecutors said Norwood beat and sexually assaulted the woman.

Investigators said blood on the bandana led them to Norwood, whose DNA was in a national database as a result of his long criminal history.

Norwood's lawyer suggested to jurors that the DNA evidence linking his client to the murder was contaminated.

DNA testing wasn't available when the blood on the bandanna was initially tested in 1986. The testing wasn't done until Michael Morton's attorneys spent years lobbying for it.

Norwood, 58, also has been indicted in a 1988 slaying of another Austin woman who lived near the Mortons.

Prosecutors also told jurors that a gun Norwood stole from the Mortons' home and later sold linked him to the murder. Morton testified at the trial, telling jurors about the missing gun.

The trial is being held in San Angelo after being moved from Williamson County, near Austin, because of publicity in the case. The Texas Attorney General's Office handled the prosecution and was not seeking the death penalty.

Last month, a special hearing known as a court of inquiry was held to examine whether state District Judge Ken Anderson acted improperly in 1987 when, as Williamson County district attorney, he prosecuted Michael Morton. Morton's lawyers have accused Anderson of intentionally hiding evidence.

Anderson has denied any wrongdoing. A decision by a judge on whether Anderson should face criminal charges in the case might come next month. Anderson also is being sued by the State Bar of Texas for his conduct in the Morton case.

Anderson choked back tears on the witness stand during the special hearing as he recalled the prosecution he described as his 'worst nightmare.'

Anderson, who is now a judge in Georgetown near Austin, is accused of withholding evidence indicating Morton's innocence during the original trial.

During days of testimony, the somber-looking Anderson sounded a defiant note when he told the court he did nothing wrong, saying that the office he ran was professional and competent.

Then, his voice cracking, Anderson added, 'We got it right as much as we humanly could.'

But despite his conviction that there was no misconduct on his part, Anderson offered an emotional apology to the wrongly convicted man.

'I know what me and my family have been through for 18 months of false accusations, and it doesn’t even register in the same ballpark of what you went through.'

'I don’t know that I can say I feel your pain, but I have a pretty darn good idea how horrible what you've gone through... with false accusations and everything else. What happened to you was so much worse than that. I can't imagine what you have been feeling,' Anderson told Morton in a quiet voice, American-Statesman reported.

He the added, 'I apologize that the 
system screwed up. I've beaten myself up on what I could have done 
different and I don't know. Maybe the Norwood prosecutor has something 
the sheriff's office missed.'

On his part, Morton has called for leniency for the man whose prosecution landed him in prison for a quarter of a century.

In his testimony, Morton asked Judge 
Louis Sturns to 'be gentle' with Anderson, explaining that he has 'a 
little empathy' the former DA because he knows what's it like to have 
'everybody coming after you,' according to KXAN. 

Following Anderson's courtroom mea culpa, Morton said he was not expecting the encounter.

'This
is raw. It caught me really off guard,' he told the Statesman. 'I 
wasn't prepared for it. I'm sure he would completely agree, but I'm not 
sure he has a complete grasp of what this is all about, not personally.'

The February proceedings came on the 
heels of an admission by a juror who originally convicted Morton that he
wished he would have had an opportunity to see police investigative 
files and other key evidence during the trial.

Mark Landrum was jury foreman in the 1987 case that sent Morton to prison for life.

Morton
was freed on DNA evidence in 2011, and is now part of a special 
proceeding known as a Court of Inquiry that will determine whether 
Anderson could face criminal charges for allegedly withholding evidence.

Landrum testified last month that during the trial, the defense 'constantly made sure we knew that there was no hard evidence.'

Convict: Morton was found guilty of his wife's murder and sentenced to life in prison

'They
said, "It could have been an intruder, it could have been someone 
else," ' Landrum said. 'I remember thinking, "Wow, they created that 
doubt on what the possibilities were."' But, he added, Morton's legal 
team "didn't have any facts to hang" those doubts on.

During
the original case, which was tried in Georgetown, north of Austin, the 
defense objected that prosecutors were withholding evidence. Presiding 
Judge William Lott ordered Anderson to turn over case files that could 
contain evidence aiding Morton's legal team.

Anderson
produced only a few pages of information, which Lott decided wouldn't 
sway the case. The defense and the jury never saw what Anderson gave the
judge.

Omitted
from what Lott saw were case notes from police that the Mortons' 
three-year-old son told his grandmother he saw a 'monster,' not his 
father, beating his mother.

There
was also a report from a neighbor who said she previously saw a man 
park a green van near the Morton home and head into a wooded area, as if
he were casing the residence.

When presented with those facts last 
month, Landrum said, 'I wish I had been given the opportunity to know 
this while we were making our decision.'

Landrum
also disputed, the theory now advanced by Morton's legal team, that 
Anderson's co-prosecutor, Mike Davis, bragged to members of the jury 
immediately after the case that if it had gotten a look at the police 
files, the defense could have used them 'to raise even more doubt.'

Rarely used, courts of inquiry can be ordered when legal officials and public servants are accused of wrongdoing.

Defiant: Ken Anderson defended his performance as Williamson County district attorney

During an argument at the hearing over introducing more evidence, Morton's attorney Rusty Hardin said that everything not admitted 'was like another day of freedom taken from' Morton.

Anderson attorney Eric Nichols slammed his hand on a table and cried, 'Judge we need to stop this!' He yelled about 'speechmaking' and said past courts of inquiry in Texas have degenerated into 'circuses' and 'mob scenes.'

Nichols argued that the original trial judge was actually only seeking Morton's testimony to police on the day of his wife's killing, making the rest of the case file, and police notes, irrelevant.

He also questioned whether the defense attorney, Bill Allison, vigorously sought the evidence or could be exaggerating his recollections. Allison wavered a bit, saying, 'It's always bothered me that that would be the issue. How do you know what didn't happen?'

Hardin then asked Allison how he would rate his work as a defense attorney. The witness choked up: 'I have felt for a long time that I really let Michael down in some way.'

When Allison left the stand, Morton gave him a bear-hug.

The hearing concluded with the testimony of another former district attorney, John Bradley.

After Anderson became a judge, it fell to Bradley to continue overseeing the Morton case through the appeal process — and he argued for years against expanded DNA testing, once it became available in the matter.

Bradley was defeated in the Republican primary last year, in part because of the publicity generated by Morton's exoneration.
