Jose Mourinho has hailed the way Didier Drogba reunited with Chelsea's squad as being like he had 'been on a holiday'.

The Ivorian striker joined up with his new - and old - teammates in Ljubljana on Chelsea's pre season tour and looked to fit right in, almost as if he had never left the club two years ago.

And Chelsea have announced that the returning hero will be wearing the No 15 shirt this season - the same that he first wore when he arrived at Stamford Bridge in 2004.

Drogba spent two years with that number before switching to the No 11 shirt which he famously wore when ending his first spell at the club during the 2012 Champions League final in Munich.

'When he came in, I think for everybody else it looks like he never left the club,' Mourinho said. 'It was so normal because he knows everybody, everybody knows him.

'He was present even when he wasn't. Chelsea belonged to him even when in the last two years when he wore Galatasaray and Shanghai shirts.

'It looks like he went for a short holiday then came back.'

And Mourinho was keen to make it clear that Drogba will not just be around to make up the numbers.

'I think we need him as a player, we need him as a player for our squad to be the way I like because I like the squad with different qualities.

'Not just as football players, in terms of personalities. I like to have players with different personalities.

'I think as a player and a person he's someone we need to be strong.'

Drogba could make his second Chelsea debut against Vitesse Arnhem in Holland on Wednesday.
