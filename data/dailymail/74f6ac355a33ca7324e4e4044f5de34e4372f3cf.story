A wrong turn on a hike led to an innocent pack of Cub Scouts learning a bit more about mother nature than perhaps their leaders intended.

The boys, aged nine and 10 years, came face-to-face with dozens of naked people after stumbling onto a nudist beach during a coastal walk through San Diego's Torrey Pines State Beach

The red faced leader of the San Diego Cub Scout pack was confront by outraged parents after taking a trail across the sand at Black's Beach.

The San Diego Cub Scouts from Troop 766 got an eyeful when they were lead onto a nudist beach during a nature hike

The boys, aged nine and 10 years, were confronted by dozens of naked naturists enjoying Black's Beach

Officials said the hike, which took place last month, was swiftly 're-routed' after organisers discovered the error.

But one angry parent claimed that it was far from a mistake. 

Diane Lekven, who was on the hike told CBS News 8 in San Diego: 'He (the leader) said 'This is a naturalist beach, and my family and I go through here all the time.

'It's not a big deal.I got really angry.

'I was nauseated because I've never seen just a bunch of nude people walking around holding hands, strange people that I don't know,' she said.

The leader of troop 766 was hauled before a meeting with parents and local officials to discuss what happened. 

Black's Beach states on its website that it is affiliated with the Naturist Society and that clothing is optional. 

The Scouting Association said that the 'proper protocol' was followed and 'appropriate steps were taken'

Angry parents questioned whether the leader of the troop had made a mistake when he led the innocent child onto the sand

'During a planned hiking trip at Torrey Pines State Beach, a local Cub Scout Pack encountered some individuals who were inappropriately dressed,' said the Boy Scouts Association of America, CBS News 8 reported.

'This outing, involving both parents and adult volunteer leaders, was quickly rerouted to protect the youth. 

'Following the trip, both San Diego-Imperial Council and Pack leadership met with parents to discuss the events and determine if further action was needed.

'Together we concluded that proper protocol had been observed and appropriate steps were taken in this matter.'

Black's Beach is a well known spot for nudist and states on its website that clothing is optional
