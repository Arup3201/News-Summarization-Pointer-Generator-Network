Familiar face: Demba Ba is likely to feature for Besiktas when they face Arsenal in the Champions League

BESIKTAS

UEFA ranking: 66

Record against Arsenal: Never played

How they qualified: Third in Turkish Super League

Besiktas finished just three points behind Galatasary last term but a mammoth 12 behind champions Fenerbahce.

That's the same Fenerbahce who were beaten 5-0 on aggregate by the Gunners in a Champions League play-off last year. 

Easy street: Arsenal defeated Fenerbahce 5-0 on aggregate in a Champions League play-off last season

But with the Turkish champions banned from Europe, Besiktas inherited the second of the two Champions League places on offer to Turkey. 

They have only won the Turkish top flight three times in the last 20 years, with their last success coming in 2009.

Besiktas are consistent finishers inside the top four, having only finished below the position just twice since 1980.

Star man - Demba Ba

There's plenty for Arsenal to be concerned about in Besiktas - especially their attacking prowess.

The Turkish side feature Demba Ba in attack, with the former Chelsea and Newcastle striker an £8million signing from the Blues earlier this summer.

Hat-trick hero: Demba Ba (centre) scored a treble for Besiktas on his home debut against Feyenoord

Already he has found the score sheet, netting a hat-trick on his home debut in the third qualifying round 3-1 win over Feyenoord. 

Manager - Slaven Bilic

As Croatia boss, Bilic was once touted as one of the Europe's most promising managers.

The former West Ham and Everton defender famously recorded two wins over England in the Euro 2008 qualifiers to help dump the Three Lions out of the tournament before Steve McClaren's side had even left Wembley for Austria and Switzerland.

On the up: Slaven Bilic is rebuilding his reputation at Besiktas after a disastrous spell at Lokomotiv Moscow

After leaving Croatia, Bilic's reputation took a battering after just one season at Lokomotiv Moscow as he guided the Russian club to their worst league placing since 1992, with a ninth placed finish.

The former defender has since re-emerged at Besiktas where in his first season at the club he guided them back into Champions League contention.

Group stage campaigns: Five (last appearance - 2009-10)

In the Champions League era, Besiktas have only made the main tournament five times - never progressing beyond the group stage. 

Last season: Europa League play-offs 

Having been out of Champions League action since 2009, the last three seasons have seen Besiktas compete in the Europa League. 

Defeat in England: Besiktas reached the Europa League last 16 in 2012 but were beaten by Stoke along the way

They reached the last 32 in 2011 before going one better in a year later to reach the last 16. But they were kicked out of the competition following their play-off victory over Tromso last term following previous match fixing allegations.

Best European Cup performance: Quarter-finals (1986-87) 

Besiktas' finest European Cup campaign came in 1987...where they won just two games before reaching the quarter-finals.

Two victories to defeat Dinamo Tirana, were followed by a walkover victory over APOEL who were prohibited by their Cypriot government from playing the tie.

The joy for Besiktas was short lived however, as Dynamo Kiev thrashed them 7-0 on aggregate in the last eight.

Playing the Blues: John Terry (front) looks stunned as Besiktas's biggest Champions League away victory came at Chelsea with a 2-0 win in 2003

UEFA records:

Biggest home win

3-0 vs Barcelona (19/09/00, group stage)

Biggest away win

2-0 vs Chelsea (01/10/2003, group stage)

Heavy hiding: But Peter Crouch was on target as Liverpool beat them 8-0 at Anfield in 2007 to inflict their heaviest European defeat

Humiliated: Besiktas were hugely embarrassed after being beaten 8-0 by Liverpool in the Champions League

Heaviest home defeat

0-3 vs VfL Wolfsburg (03/11/09, group stage)

Heaviest away defeat

0-8 vs Liverpool (06/11/07, group stage)
