A battle is underway for the insurance payouts for killer dad Josh Powell and his two young sons - and now the insurer has asked the courts who, if anyone, should get the money.

It comes after the killer's sister and brother filed claims on insurance policies worth $1.5 million just nine days after he blew up his Washington home, killing himself and Braden, seven, and Charlie, five.

The New York Life Insurance Company also wants the U.S. District Court to decide who should get the $1 million policy for Susan Powell, Josh's wife who went missing from Utah in December 2009.

To add yet another complication, the company wants to know whether changes Powell made to his policy in 2011 should stand, questioning his competency at the time, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.

Murder suicide: Josh Powell killed himself and his sons, Charlie and Braden, by blowing up their home. There are now questions over who - if anyone - should get the money from their insurance claims

The changes, made three months before the killings, named his siblings and father as beneficiaries rather than his father-in-law, with whom he had been embroiled in a custody battle for his sons.

According to the Tribune, documents filed in the Washington court write: 'New York Life has concerns regarding Joshua Powell’s competency at the time the beneficiary changes were made.'

It adds that 'doubtful questions' remain over payments being made to a 'slayer’s siblings and/or father'.

Chuck and Judy Cox, the parents of Susan plan to support the insurers request for a review, their attorney told the Tribune.

'Clearly, under any law, he didn’t have the right to change the beneficiaries,' Steve Downing said.

The $1 million policy in Susan's name came as a shock to West Valley Police, who said they were not aware of any insurance policy. Chuck Cox reportedly said the question should have been asked.

A spokesman for the police would not discuss if investigators evaluated the insurance payouts as a motive for Susan’s disappearance.

The Tribune reported that Josh and Susan Powell took out insurance polices in 2007, two years before she went missing.

Missing: West Valley Police in Utah said they had not been aware of an insurance policy worth $1 million for missing mother Susan Powell

She disappeared on 6 
December 2009. Her husband had claimed she ran away after he took their boys on an impromptu camping trip in freezing conditions. Her 
body has never been found.

Powell had a five-year term life insurance policy worth $1 million and riders worth $250,000 on each of their sons.

Susan had a $500,000 five-year term policy and a $500,000 rider, according to court papers seen by the Tribune. She was initially named as the only beneficiary of Josh's policy.

In February 2009, Powell added family trust in their names as the secondary beneficiary of his policy. Powell’s brother Michael and Susan’s father were listed as joint trustees of the estate.

Powell changed his policy again in October last year, taking off Susan and the family trust as beneficiaries. This came just three days after a judge put his sons in the custody of the Coxes.

Instead, he named his brother Michael and sister Alina as the primary beneficiaries and his brother John as the secondary beneficiary, according to the Tribune.

Michael was later named as entitled to a 93 per cent share, with Alina entitled to four and John to three.

He also placed Michael and Alina's names on his son's policies, keeping himself as the primary beneficiary.

Michael and Alina both contacted New 
York Life Insurance on February 14 to ask for forms to make claims on 
their brother’s and nephews’ policies, according to the Tribune.

Fight: Chuck and Judy Cox, in-laws of Josh Powell, support a court's review of who should get the money

Plea: The New York Life Insurance Co. has appealed to the U.S. District Court to help with the decision

These are not the first complications for the years-long case, which has scores of unanswered questions.

The couple's sons, aged seven and 
five, had recently started talking about their mother and what happened the 
night of their trip, saying that when they went camping 'mommy was 
in the trunk and then mom and dad got out of the car and mom 
disappeared'.

The boys had been taken from their 
father's care and given to Susan's parents after 
authorities found child pornography and voyeuristic videos on Josh's 
father Steve Powell's computer.

It also recently emerged that Josh had 
hundreds of images of disturbing cartoon sex and graphic depictions of 
incest on his home computer, which Utah authorities knew about for two 
years.

He killed his sons in an explosion of February 5, after they had been dropped off by a social worker for a visit. Prosecutors consider the murder suicide to be an admission of guilt in his wife's death.

The two boys were laid to rest in a single casket in front of family and friends on February 13.
