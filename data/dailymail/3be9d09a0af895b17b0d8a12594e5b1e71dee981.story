A terminally ill great-grandfather mugged by thugs has branded his attackers as 'cowards'.

Cancer sufferer Jack Keppie, given just months to live, was attacked from behind by two men in their 20s while on his way home after drinking with friends in his local pub.

Mr Keppie, 69, was left with two suspected broken ribs and bruises up his arms and legs after the assault and robbery in Denton, Greater Manchester.

He said: 'I thought that was it to be honest - they could have killed me without a doubt. But eventually, they just ran off. They're disgusting. I've got terminal prostate cancer, I don't need this sort of thing happening, it was horrendous.

'I looked behind me to make sure no-one was following me, but out of nowhere, I got smacked on the back on the head and fell to the ground and landed on my stomach.

'They took my wallet out of my pocket, took the cash out then threw the wallet very aggressively in my face. Then they called me a few names and started kicking me in the stomach. They toddled off up the road, never to be seen again.'

Diagnosed with prostate cancer last October and given 12 months to live, Mr Keppie's failing health has deteriorated ever since.

But in the days leading up to the attack on August 5, he regained some strength in his legs and felt confident enough to walk alone to his local pub, the Angel in Denton, and join his friends for a drink.

But as he walked home, the two thugs, both aged around 20, attacked him from behind, one punching him in the back knocking him to the ground, before the other stood on his back and stole £100 from his wallet.

The pair kicked and swore at the defenceless pensioner as he lay on the pavement before making off.

Mr Keppie added: 'It won't stop me going out, but I'm looking behind me all the time now, I'm very cautious. I still go out, but I don't walk alone anymore. It's a short distance, but it's not worth the risk.

'It's a cowardly way to attack someone. I've got prostate cancer and they're kicking me in the stomach. They are cowards and just typical hoodies. I just don't want it to happen again.

'They should have a conscience and give themselves up. One day, this will come back to them.

'They don't deserve to be living, they're not human beings. Luckily, I've got a lot of close friends around me, looking after me. It won't happen again if they have anything to do with it.'

Detective Constable Fiona Rigby, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'This was a vicious and cowardly attack on a frail and dying man.

'He has terminal cancer and is very ill. In fact he doesn't have long to live. One of his remaining pleasures in life is to walk to his local pub for a couple of beers with his friends.

'Now because of the despicable actions of these cowards, this modest pleasure has been utterly destroyed.

'Walking to and from the pub was part of his ritual, no doubt bringing him a modicum of independence. Now he has to get a taxi out of fear.

'The robbers probably wouldn't have known about his condition, but one look at him would have told them he was frail, vulnerable and clearly not going to put up a fight - precisely why these bullies picked on him no doubt.'

Anyone in the area near the allotments on Wood Street in Denton around midnight on August 5 is urged to call police.

The attackers are described as aged around 20, 5ft 8in or 9in, with local accents. One wore a light grey tracksuit while the other wore a black tracksuit. Both wore their hoods up.
