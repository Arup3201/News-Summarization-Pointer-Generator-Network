Think of a jetpack and you may imagine flying over a futuristic city, inspired by scenes  in sci-fi films. But the technology could also be used to enable soldiers to run faster in warzones in a matter of years.

US engineers have created a working prototype that attaches to people's backs and helps them to run a mile in a much shorter space of time – despite carrying the large metal pack.

The project is the military's latest effort to create exoskeletons for US soldiers to give them super-human strength, speed and other advantages on the battlefield.

The goal behind Arizona State University’s 4MM (four minute mile) project is to enhance the speed and agility of the wearer of a jetpack so they can run a four minute mile with ease.

Jason Kerestes, an engineering student at the university explained: ‘We reduced the amount of force so we’re not able to fly with our jet pack but we have instantaneous thrust and can trigger it to allow for faster movements.’

He and his mentor are working with the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) to develop the idea for military purposes.

The goal behind Arizona State University’s 4MM (four minute mile) project is to enhance the speed and agility of the wearer of a jetpack so they can run a four minute mile with ease. In 200 metre trials, runners decreased their times and used less energy, the experts said. The equipment they have developed is pictured

‘Our goal is to get any soldier – or subject wearing the jetpack – to be able to run a four minute mile, who was not capable of doing so before,’ he said.

When Mr Kerestes and his mentor Professor Thomas Sugar were first asked by Darpa to design a way to allow soldier to run faster without using any more effort, they experimented with a system allowing a person to be pulled along, but quickly settled on a jetpack for propulsion.

Currently, a volunteer wearing the pack can shave seconds off their best time – despite carrying the 11lbs (5kg) metal pack. In one test, a runner was able to reduce their personal best for a mile from five minutes 20 seconds, to five minutes and two seconds.

In 200 metre trials, runners decreased their times and used less energy, the experts said.

Mr Kerestes said: ‘In the warfare arena this [the ability to run faster] could be the difference between life and death.’

‘Devices can help soldiers succeed in their missions and potentially save human lives.’

The U.S. Special Operations Command has called on scientists to develop a suit reminiscent of the one seen in the films like Iron Man (pictured)

The Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (Talos) would effectively give its wearer superpowers, such as the ability to see in the dark, super-human strength and a way of deflecting bullets, but its is a work in progress.

The U.S. Special Operations Command (Ussocom) has called on scientists to develop a suit reminiscent of the one seen in the films that uses nanotechnology.

Such a suit would probably build upon work done by an MIT professor who is developing 'liquid armour', which captured the imagination of U.S. armed forces scientists who are looking for a way of protecting their troops from intensive combat situations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

At a conference in May 2013, U.S. Navy Admiral Bill McRaven challenged scientists to build a suit that would function as a 'practical exoskeleton' and protect soldiers from shrapnel and bullets using Kevlar and nanotechnology.

He said that the suit should be light enough for soldiers to wear in battle but also suitable for surveillance missions and the idea has captured people's imaginations - as seen in the animated video below.

Once fully developed, the armour could transform from a more liquid form to a solid in a fraction of a second under the influence of a magnetic field or electric current as well as being able to monitor a soldier's heart rate, hydration levels and core temperature, Dvice reported.

It is thought a suit would respond to the data, supplied by an on-board computer hooked up to sensors, to keep a soldier in the best conditions for battle.

Ussocom has asked academics, entrepreneurs and private laboratories to submit white papers detailing how its Talos suit could be built and how they could help make their designs a reality, while other reports suggest that Google Glass could be utilised to provide soldiers with information on the battle field.

Exoskeletons to give people super-human strength and night vision already exist, but the challenge is building the technology into a lightweight suit.
