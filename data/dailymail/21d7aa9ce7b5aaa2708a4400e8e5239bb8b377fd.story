Landlords are calling time at the bar as developers transform pubs from smelly-carpeted watering holes into multi-million pound apartments.

The British pub has been in decline for decades with almost 20,000 shutting over the past 30 years.

More than 3,200 of these have shut in London alone and now builders are buying historic, well-positioned buildings to convert into super-pricey homes.

Southwark and Waterloo have seen 27 pubs converted while 13 have had their use changed in Chelsea.

The Red Lion, in Mayfair, was recently sold as a £25million mansion while one property developer just paid £27million for The Black Lion in Bayswater.

At £32million, the 2008 sale of the City Pride pub in Canary Wharf is the most expensive pub ever sold in London.

With a housing shortage and pub profits nosediving, landlords and breweries are taking advantage of the value of the buildings and cashing in by selling them to developers.

Trendy change: Property agents say social change, taxes, the smoking ban and cheap supermarket liquor are behind pub closures like the Redcliffe Arms

He said: 'Over the last 15 years there has been a huge wave in public houses across the capital being closing and being turned into new homes or mixed use resi-led schemes.

'This is because of social change, taxes, the 2007 smoking ban, cheap supermarket alcohol and the impact of the global recession.

'Redundant public houses across inner London have provided a very significant amount of stock for conversion into new homes or mixed use schemes.

'We recently marketed the former Red Lion Pub in Mayfair which closed in 2009 during the recession and has been converted into a five bedroom mansion priced at £25 million. It sold very quickly.'
