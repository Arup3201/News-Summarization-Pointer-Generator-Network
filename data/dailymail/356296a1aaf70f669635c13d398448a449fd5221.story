Controversy: Speaker John Bercow spent more than £1,300 on a new shower screen, official documents showed today

Commons  Speaker John Bercow splashed out more than £1,300 on a shower screen for his official residence – billing it to the taxpayer.

Official records for the Speaker’s expenses from 2010 onwards also show he spent £80 to repair a roller blind in a ‘baby bedroom’ at his grace-and-favour apartments in Westminster which he shares with his wife Sally and their three children.

Shower screens are available for as little as £35 over the internet – a fraction of the £1,320 cost of Mr Bercow’s screen.

When asked why the replacement of a 'shower screen and side panels' cost £1,320, a spokesman told MailOnline: 'The shower cubicle needed to be repaired as a screen had become faulty and beyond economical repair, as well as dangerous as it was falling. 

'The other screen was salvaged and therefore a new screen and connecting door were ordered to match the original.  This work was undertaken on the advice of the House maintenance team and not as a result of a request by the Speaker.'

The figures released under the Freedom of Information Act also show Mr Bercow spent £45,825.68 on travel over the same period, most of it on international flights.

This included £8,429.86 for the Speaker and a member of staff to fly to Washington and Boston.

Hundreds were also spent ferrying him around London and larger sums on flights to Canada, India. Greece and Europe.

'The speaker has an extensive outreach
programme as an ambassador for the House of Commons and therefore 
undertakes significant travel,' a Commons spokesman told the Telegraph.

The Speaker also displayed a fondness for official cars.

He repeatedly spent £74.40 for a 
return journey to the neighbouring London postcode of SE1, which is no 
more than £20 return in a taxi.

The spokesman added: ‘The Speaker has an extensive outreach programme and therefore undertakes significant travel.’

He also £145.50 for his TV Licence as well as thousands in council tax.

The details, released in a freedom of information response, show his spending over the last two years.

In 2009 Mr Bercow had his flat refurbished at a cost of more than £45,000 to the taxpayer soon after he took the job.

This was more than double the £20,000 he initially said he would be spending to make his official residence suitable for a family with three young children.

Documents revealed Mrs Bercow asked Commons officials for a larger TV, a DVD player and wallpaper which would make the residence feel less like an office.

But email exchanges showed some concern among officials about the cost of the work, with one pointing out that Mr Bercow had said he only wanted to spend what were considered to be 'reasonable' sums and noting that 'the list is getting longer'.

The documents also revealed Mr Bercow spent almost £13,000 over three months on entertaining and hospitality, including £3,599 on a three-night trip to Rome to attend a G8 Speakers' conference.
