Three men have been arrested after police seized a massive haul of cannabis resin weighing as much as a rhino.

Hugh Webb, 52, Michael Malone, 46, and Martin Merritt, 39, allegedly made two large blue metal boxes to transport the 1.7 tonne load, worth an estimated £5 million.

Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate found the class B drugs on the back of a 40ft refrigerated container lorry in Sandy Lane, Ashford, Kent, last Friday.

Haul: The three men made gigantic blue metal containers to hold the 1.7 tonne load

Officers stopped the lorry which was hauling a 40ft refrigerated container and found two massive blue metal containers containing £5million worth of cannabis.

Detective Chief Inspector Eddie Fox said: 'We have been successful in taking a staggering amount of illegal drugs off of the streets.

'This was a huge haul which will never make its way into circulation in the county.

'Our action to tackle drugs in Kent should send a warning message to people within organised criminal networks that we will leave no stone unturned to find them and put them before the court.'

Kent and Essex Serious Crime 
Directorate is a collaboration between the two counties that has 
increased their capacity to deal with serious and organised crime.
