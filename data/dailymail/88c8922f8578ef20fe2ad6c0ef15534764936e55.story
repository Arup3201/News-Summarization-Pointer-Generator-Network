Ever mindlessly 'liked' a total stranger's picture on Instagram? One man did just that - and the photo's owner turned out to be his future wife.

Andrew Dearling, 28, from London, was scouring the social media site one day when he stumbled across Nashville-born Nicole Drummond's page, liking a few of her snaps.  

Nicole lived over 4,000 miles away and was engaged to someone else when she 'liked' some of Andrew's photos back. 

A slew of communication followed via text messages and FaceTime, which later resulted in a plane journey, a first meeting, and then a guest-free wedding. And it seems that the couple are part of a growing number of tech-savvy romantics meeting their other halves on the picture-sharing site.

Andrew Dearling stumbled across Nashville-born Nicole Drummond's page on Instagram and after liking a few of her snaps, the pair got chatting and decided to meet. A year later, they are happily married

Andrew, who worked at a PR agency in London, stumbled across Nicole's picture while browsing a video game hashtag for #Halo, leading Nicole - who works in Human Resources and like Andrew, loves gaming - to investigate who he was.

'I was curious about the random person who had liked my photo, so I went over to his Instagram and saw how cute he was,' she told MailOnline recently. 

'And he was from London! So I started liking some of his selfies and London shots and then we exchanged phone numbers and used iMessage to chat.'

The Instagram fanatics documented every step of their relationship in snaps. In fact, most of their friends only found out they had tied the knot when the couple shared it online

True to the nature of their digital love affair, Andrew only discovered that Nicole was engaged when he browsed her Tumblr page.

'When I asked her about it, she admitted it but said she wasn’t really in love,' Andrew recalls. 'So, I just continued to message and flirt with her.'

Last September, Andrew made the trip to 30-year-old Nicole's home in Nashville, where he wasted no time in proposing. Nicole accepted and the couple embarked on a 900-mile road trip to move Nicole to New York City, where she had scored a new job.  

Following their nuptials, Andrew headed home, but then moved out to New York in December 2013 to be with Nicole.

After only two meetings, Andrew proposed when he went to visit Nicole in the States. He later moved from London to the States to start his life with her

The Instagram fanatics document every step of their relationship online, from their mundane days at home to romantic festive activities. In fact, most of their friends only found out they had tied the knot when the couple shared it on the internet.

Andrew and Nicole aren't the only pair who found love on the picture sharing site. 

Jess Macdonald and David Angell also found love online. David was a huge fan of Jess' feed and she later found out that he had been following her pictures for months and had even come to one of her photography exhibitions.

After meeting face-to-face, they had an instant chemistry. The duo both attended an instameet - where members of the Instagram community get together and discuss all things photography - in Trafalgar Square, London, and realised that something was starting between them.

Nicole lived over 4,000 miles away and was engaged to someone else when she 'liked' some of Andrew's photos back but she later revealed she wasn't in love with that man

Their first date was Sunday afternoon drinks on a boat on the Thames but they were talking so much that, ironically, neither of them took any photos. Their second date was making sushi, which they documented online.

So obsessed with the site  are the pair that they forged firm friendships with many people from around the world who also love it.

When Jessica moved to Kennington, London, to be nearer David, her lounge became a place for traveling Instagrammers to stay if they were in the city. 

Jess Macdonald and David Angell also found love online, whilst they don't share as many loved-up selfies as the other couples, they have documented their journey, included their engagement, via Instagram

David uploaded this snap of Jessica with the caption: 'So many thanks to friends old and new, it's been an epic year. To 2015 we go, can't wait to marry this lady'

Eventually, influential American Instagrammer Dan Rubin ended up staying so much they renamed the room 'The Dan Rubin Suite'. 

Dan would pay for his stay by making them breakfast and now he is one of their best friends and was asked to be Jessica’s best man at their wedding.

They couple tied the knot last year and Jessica said: 'Instagram really has changed both of our lives and we are eternally grateful for it bringing us together.'

Elizabeth posted a picture of Crater Lake in Oregon, and Denis left a comment on it to say that he missed it there. 

Many back-and-forth comments and a phone number exchange later, Elizabeth flew out to New Orleans to meet Denis in person for the first time. 

Nine months later, the couple found themselves at Elizabeth’s grandmother’s barn in Texas, where Denis had arranged printed and Valencia-hued photos documenting their relationship and got down on one knee.
