Roy Hodgson has a rare luxury as an England manager in that he has a year to build a team who are almost sure to qualify for Euro 2016.

It probably does not feel that way to him, as every game as England manager feels as though it has potential dangers.

But, in reality, England have weathered the storm of their World Cup disappointment and are now firmly focused on Euro 2016. I fully expect the team to make another step in that direction in Estonia on Sunday.

Given that we are almost certain to qualify, I believe there is an opportunity to be bold and try different players. Roy has settled on the diamond formation as one way of playing and, as such, that needs a good holding player.

Jack Wilshere did do really well there on Thursday night, though it is difficult to judge against San Marino when you have so much time on the ball. And it is not his natural game. On Thursday night, both Ian Wright and I came up with the name of Tom Huddlestone as an alternative.

He is not currently in favour. He has just four caps and has been used only once by Roy, as a substitute in a friendly against Sweden. As a sitting player, there are few Englishmen who can match Huddlestone. He does that job of screening the back four and he has a range of passing that few can match.

I am also looking forward to the return of Daniel Sturridge. With Danny Welbeck and Wayne Rooney fit, England could field a fearsome front three. I think they could all play together, with Rooney playing just behind the front two, as he has started to do for his club.

There would still be room for Raheem Sterling. He has the tactical awareness to play on the outside of the diamond and give you width.

In a diamond, I always like to have it a little lop-sided, with one player on the outside who can go a bit wider and one who tucks inside. Sterling would give you that option. Adam Lallana would be perfect to go on the left, or Wilshere. And you still have Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Andros Townsend and, when he is fit, Ross Barkley to add to that mix.

There is a great range of attacking options for England coming through, with the potential to generate excitement.

With this run of qualification games, we have a chance to nail down an attacking system and get so confident with it, so that by the time we get to Euro 2016, we may be causing teams so many problems we can worry less about the problems they are causing us.
