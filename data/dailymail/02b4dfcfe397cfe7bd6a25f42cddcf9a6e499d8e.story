A couple have been left devastated after their neighbours accidentally took their cat to the tip in a rolled up carpet.

Albus was last seen playing with a neighbour's kitten among old carpets destined for Sharston Recycling Centre in Manchester a week ago, but has not been spotted since.

His owners Zoe and Chris Gray believe that when their neighbour in Burnage took a load to the tip, Albus found his way into the van.

They have issued an urgent appeal in the hope someone has seen two-and-a-half-year-old Albus since he went missing last Monday.

'We are devastated. We just really want anyone to get in touch if they have seen him. We so want him home,' said Mrs Gray.

'It would be nice to know someone is looking after him and he is okay. He is part of our family.'

The bar and restaurant manager said a worker at the skip had seen a cat jump from the back of the neighbour's van.

She said: 'We came home and there was a knock on the door. It was our neighbour. He said a worker at the skip had seen a cat jump from the back of his van and he must have climbed in, maybe with some carpets.

'The neighbour had recently moved in and they are refurbishing so there are carpets everywhere.

'It's not the neighbour's fault as Albus would have been playing. They have also printed off hundreds of flyers and helped us search.'

It is believed that the feline ran off in the direction of Didsbury Golf Club or the railway line

Albus is described as 'quite big, grey with a white belly and a little grey spot on his chin, like a goatee'.

It is believed that the feline ran off in the direction of Didsbury Golf Club.

'He could be anywhere around the tip. He ran in the direction of the railway line and Didsbury Golf Club so we are thinking he'll be around there,' said Mrs Gray.

'The last time we saw him was sitting on a carpet and looking at us as if to say 'Here I am'.'

The couple, who also have another cat Charley, five, have been out scouring local streets and parks for Albus every day since he disappeared.
