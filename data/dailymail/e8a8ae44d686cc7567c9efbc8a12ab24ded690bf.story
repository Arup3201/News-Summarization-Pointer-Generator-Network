West Ham will begin selling season tickets for the Olympic Stadium from this April.

The Hammers leave their Boleyn Ground home for Stratford in August 2016.

And the east London club will invite season ticket holders, who renew for the final season at Upton Park next season, to be the first to guarantee their seats at the new 54,000-capacity arena.

Sportsmail can reveal that West Ham will officially open the doors to their specialist Reservation Centre at the Westfield Shopping Centre in Stratford, just yards from the Olympic Stadium, to kickstart the process.

Vast numbers of corporate seats have already been sold on a fixed three-year term, but this is the first time the club's core base of some 20,000 season ticket holders will be able to secure their seat in the new stadium.

Supporters who pay the higher 'Band One' fees will be the first to do so in three months time, with those in bands two, three and four - the cheapest of the season tickets available - will be invited across successive dates later in the year before the process concludes next January.

Fans will be offered a comparable seat to those they currently have at Upton Park, with a 3D virtual venue viewing technology offering a unique chance to experience what their new sightline and surroundings will be within the stadium.

However they must complete a down-payment of 25% of the cost of their season ticket for the 2016/17 campaign on the day of their appointment to guarantee their new seat.

West Ham last week announced that all adult season tickets are to rise by 5% - after a price freeze last season - for the final year at Upton Park. In addition to that, fans have been set a deadline of paying a deposit of £75 by the end of April, settling the remainder by the end of May, in line with previous year's renewal deadlines.

But a club spokesperson explained: 'The club's first priority is to offer every season ticket holder a comparable seat in the new stadium to the one they have for the final season at the Boleyn Ground.

'Additionally, season ticket holders are able to group their seats together with friends and family and have the opportunity to bring with them up to two new season ticket holders.

'In devising a process to meet those priorities, the club had three guiding principles: that the process should be fair and transparent to all supporters, with the efficiency to accommodate 40,000 supporters coming through the Reservation Centre doors.'

Once all 2015/16 season ticket holders' appointments are complete, and the new stadium waiting list has been serviced, any remaining season tickets will be made available for general sale.

For more information, the club have produced a full Q&A available to read on their official website, www.whufc.com.
