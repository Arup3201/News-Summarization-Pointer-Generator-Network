James Rodriguez ran the show with a sensational two-goal display to fire Colombia into the last eight. Check out his heat map.

It should have been an impossible act to follow but one very special young man came out to claim the grandest of all Brazil’s World Cup stages as his own.

James Rodriguez, 22, Colombia’s  £37.5million man, elevated himself above Messi, Muller et al as the leading scorer at Brazil 2014.

He did so with two goals at the Maracana, this vaulting cathedral to a game which is a religion here.

The first was one of the most wondrously explosive to be seen at this or any major tournament ever contested.

The second finished a dazzling movement to take his tally here to five and lead his country into a quarter-final on Friday against their Brazilian hosts in Fortaleza.

Ratings by JEFF POWELL at the Maracana

To
 come upon such a talent is as thrilling in its way as the saving of 
this World Cup by the inside of a post from the last kick of the penalty
 shoot-out.

This
 should have been an anti-climax after Brazil’s escape from purgatory an
 hour earlier.

But at least the next Latin American double act to come 
before the global audience did so in an atmosphere of enormous relief 
and ecstatic celebration which makes carnival in Rio seem like a 
vicarage tea party.

Had
 Brazil gone out, the neutral ramparts of the Maracana would have been a
 morgue. The protesters would have been returning to the streets in 
their tens of thousands to remind this government that billions had been
 squandered on the football instead of the education, health and 
transportation of the socially deprived majority.

Victory
 for Chile would have signalled the most catastrophic turn-off in 
sporting history. Instead, mercifully, attention turned to who would be 
next up for the hosts of the beautiful game. How delightful that it is 
to be the boys from Bogota.

Outclassed: Oscar Tabarez saw his side convincingly beaten in Rio

James Rodriguez was a 100-1 outsider to win the Golden Boot behind more well-known players such as Lionel Messi and Neymar.But the Colombian midfielder struck twice in the last 16 clash with Uruguay and now has five goals in the tournament and leads the race to be the top goal scorer.Rodriguez is now as short as 2-1 to end the World Cup with the Golden Boot.

Rodriguez,
 who plays for Monaco, and his pals are adding a smiling freshness of 
their own to the spectacle. They were the beauty, though we did not 
have  the beast. The new firm of Rodriguez, Martinez and Gutierrez were 
prosecuting the case for Colombia but there was no Suarez to protest his
 innocence.

In
 one way he was a loss. How can you have heroes without a villain? But 
if it was inevitable that Suarez would succumb to his blood-lust under 
pressure here, better sooner than later. The longer this tournament 
goes on delivering great football, the quicker he’ll be forgotten.

Erasure
 was always going to be hastened by the departure of his colleagues. 
Colombia’s youngsters had been warned to expect a rough ride from men 
seething with a misplaced sense of injustice. They braced themselves, 
strengthened by the knowledge that the majority of neutrals were rooting
 for them.

Suarez has darkened not only his own reputation but that 
of his team and his country. There was precious little sympathy for 
Uruguay as they came out of their bunker of loathing, still accusing 
everyone they could think of from FIFA to the English-speaking media of 
persecuting their nice Senor Suarez. The question was whether they would
 translate all that self-delusion into a singular act of vengeance.

Yet,
 Uruguay were pretty much on their best behaviour. Even as the boos and 
jeers rained down on them from on high they concentrated on trying to 
play their football.

By and large they weren’t very good at it, but 
players who had felt obliged to join their nation’s rallying behind the 
Liverpool Lip seemed to understand the need for some kind of redemption.
 Thus it was uneventful until Rodriguez struck in the 28th minute, from 
almost as many yards. He chested the ball down with back to goal, then 
swivelled to complete one devastatingly elegant movement with a volley 
which thundered down and in off the bar.

Belief surged through his 
team and five minutes into the second half they compiled a different 
kind of beauty. A cleverly constructed move set up Pablo Armero for a 
cross which Juan Guillermo Cuadrado headed back for Rodriguez to turn 
home with conviction.

Uruguay are following their flawed genius home 
but not in quite the purdah we imagined. Colombia glide on to the next, 
and so far greatest, challenge of their young lives.
