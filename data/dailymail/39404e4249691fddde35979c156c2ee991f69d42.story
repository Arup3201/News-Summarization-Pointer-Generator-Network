Beloved entertainer Neil Patrick Harris has revealed how he first told his mother he thought he was gay when he was just 13 - after he was drawn to guys in a 'tingly kind of way'.

The 41-year-old star told how he opened up to his mother Sheila in 1986 after he developed a crush on the trumpet player in his middle school band, and said: 'Mom, I'm afraid I'm gay'.

But in his new autobiography, the recently married, father-of-two, said his mother simply replied that although it may be a phase, it would not make any difference in how much his parents loved him.

He writes: 'And she sees that even though you date some really nice girls through your high school years, it's the cute new boy in your class or on set who really gets under your skin and thrills you and spurs your imagination.

Happy: Neil Patrick Harris is now married and the father of twins - but admits in his new autobiography it took him years to admit he was gay 

Teenage star: Neil Patrick Harris rose to fame as prodigal doctor Doogie Howser M.D. in 1980s TV hit

In Choose Your Own Autobiography, NPH reveals how he experimented with psychedelic drugs to try and expand his mind - and jokes how a kiss on the mouth from Burt Reynolds during filming on B.L. Stryker may have sealed the deal that he was gay.

In the book, which offers fans the chance to take their own path while recounting moments of his life, NPH - who found fame aged 16 on 80s TV hit, Doogie Howser, M.D - acknowledges that throughout the show's run his 'actual sexual identity at this time is a mystery, even to you. Especially to you.'

And he admits that it took years for him to come to terms with his sexuality, labeling himself bisexual before telling his parents he was gay. His mother, he says, was accepting, while his dad Ronald took a while to come to terms with news.

Still, he says:  'You've come a long way from the anonymous skulker trolling the AOL chat rooms.' 

And he declares: 'You are gay. You know that you are; you like that you are; you’re proud that you are. You are totally gay. and now you are totally gay and totally in love, and it’s wonderful’.

‘After a long internal journey, you now embrace being gay, recognizing it as a wonderful and integrally important component part of the totality that is you’.

‘You are full out…to yourself’.'

While now a feted star of TV, movies and Broadway, having recently won a Tony award for Hedwig and the Angry Inch and now appearing in box office hit Gone Girl, NPH admits that after Doogie Howser ended in 1993, he struggled to find work.

He was, he said, forever pigeon-holed as the sweet-faced, teenage doctor.

Finding audio lectures by Tony Robbins helpful, NPH attended weekend seminars by the self-help guru in Hawaii, which he found 'transformative'. 

And while on a bid to expand his mind and horizons, the actor visited childhood friends Louis and Elizabeth Rutherford in New Mexico. 

Happy to be as far removed from Hollywood, he spent time hiking and mountain climbing, eventually moving to Placitas for 'eighteen wonderful months'.

There was, he says, a brief experiment with psychedelic drugs. He was, however, 'one of the few people to find the drug neither transcendent nor horrific, just kinda weird.'

Acknowledging he was bisexual - which seemed like a 'half-truth, but the only truth' he knew at the time, NPH went on to guest star in TV sitcoms and dramas.

It was while appearing on B.K.Stryker that show star Burt Reynolds kissed him. NPH writes: 'As a joke at the end of one take, Burt leans over and kisses you square on the mouth. The crew thinks this is very funny, but it makes you uncomfortable. Uncomfortable and, it will ultimately turn out, gay. Burt Reynolds' kiss makes you gay.' 

Struggling to come to terms with his sexuality, the entertainer had his first gay liaison with a co-star called Andy, with whom he appeared in a 1997 production of the musical Rent. He says: 'On the plus side, you did have an orgasm', as he calls their meetings 'a tentative first step towards a new life'.

However, the sporadic hook-ups are not enough and he wanted more, he says, prompting him to go on online chatrooms, where he sent pictures of body parts to strangers - and leading to a clandestine hook-up, where he spent the whole time with a baseball cap low over his head. 

While visiting a friend in Germany, NPH said he feels 'anonymous' and visited a loud, punk-industrial gay dance club.

Here, for the first time, he says, he danced for the purposes of seduction. He started making out with a man called Christophe and it was a big step, 'so, so great'.

The pair ended up in bed and 'it's fantastic', despite the fact NPH spoke no German and Christophe barely no English

All smiles: NPH, David Burkta and their twins. The star tells of his love for his husband in his autobiography

Cuties: Gideon and Harper celebrated their fourth birthdays on Monday. Neil Patrick Harris and his husband David Burkta posted pictures of the tots as NPH wrote: 'I can't believe that you used to be tiny baby things. And now, this'

Family: Neil Patrick Harris met David Burkta in 2003 upon a chance meeting on the street in New York. They married in Italy in September and are the parents of twins Gideon and Harper - and live together in Manhattan

The star writes, 'So you smoke cigarettes laced with hashish...and it goes on all night and you don't want it to the end.'    

But it is his meeting with David Burktka, the love of his life and now his husband, that forever changed NPH's life.

The pair originally met in 2003 when he was in New York to star in Cabaret when NPH bumped into his Into the Woods co-star Kate Reinders, who was accompanied by a 'rakishly handsome James Dean-like hot dud in a leather jacket and T-shrt with a little gray hair, which is always a plus.' 

David 'puts out his hand with great indifference', and when he turned away, NPH congratulated Kate on her new love - only for her to reply: 'David? Oh, no, he's totally gay,' as NPH writes: 'Contrary to popular belief, gaydar technology is still imperfect, even among gays...And David isn't swishy.

The right man: NPH says in his book that when he went on his first date with David Burkta it was 'natural' and 'familiar', adding: 'It's as cosy as an old shoe. You've met the right man, and luckily you've done so at the right time'

However, David WAS in a relationship with a Hollywood publicist, one whom had 'the power to sabotage your career with one swift broad-stroke email.' 

But when that ended, the pair went out on the date and he reminisces: 'It's natural. it's familiar. it's as cozy as an old shoe. You've met the right man, and luckily you've done so at the right time'. 

NPH publicly came out as gay in November 2006, saying: 'I am happy to dispel any rumors or misconceptions and am quite proud to say that I am a very content gay man living my life to the fullest and feel most fortunate to be working with wonderful people in the business I love.'

On set: NPH preparing for Gone Girl, the movie adaptation of the hit book by Gillian Flynn. It stars Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike 

After releasing his 'Gaytease-burg' address to People magazine, NPH admits: 'The most gratifying reaction was the deafening silence of hundreds of millions of Americans thinking to themselves, who gives a s**t’?'

He married David in Italy in September with close friend Sir Elton John performing and Pam Fryer, the director of his long-running sitcom How I Met Your Mother, officiating.

The couple are the parents of twins Gideon and Harper, who celebrated their fourth birthdays yesterday.
