Sure, St Andrews is the home of golf and Monaco hosts the most glamorous race on the Formula One circuit, but the sporting world offers so much more than what can be seen on television.

With the warmer months upon us the countdown is on for all manner of festivals around the globe, with many of them revolving around intriguing, entertaining and downright wacky events. 

MailOnline Travel sheds some light on the most unique sporting escapes you could take this year as a spectator or in some cases even as a participant, from the historic cheese-rolling race in Gloucestershire to the Mud Olympics in Brunsbuettel, Germany.

The 20th annual Wife Carrying World Championships will be held on July 3 and 4 in Sonkajärvi, Finland

WIFE CARRYING WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS: SONKAJARVI, FINLAND

While it doesn't exactly fly the flag for sexual equality, the annual Wife Carrying World Championships certainly appears to be a fun couple of days in Sonkajärvi, Finland.

Since 1994 couples from around the world have converged on the town of about 4,000 people that without the event would be famous for having more than 200 lakes in the area. 

The 20th edition will be held this year over July 3 and 4 and be another carnival-like affair with, of course, the wife carrying as the main event but also including markets and a fiercely contested karaoke competition.

In wife carrying, a man must carry a woman weighing at least 108lbs (if she is less than this she has to wear weights) around a 830ft sand track with tricky obstacles to contend with.

While it sounds like a pub dare that's simply gone too far, the event has roots in the late 19th century when the leader of a local gang called Rosvo-Ronkainen tested potential recruits on a tough obstacle course - it wasn't uncommon for the men to steal women from nearby towns. 

A wheel of cheese speeds away from its chasers on the steep slope of Cooper's Hill near Brockworth

CHEESE-ROLLING RACE: BROCKWORTH, GLOUCESTERSHIRE 

Every year a wheel of cheese is rolled down the steep slope of Cooper's Hill on the outskirts of the village of Brockworth and is followed by a bunch of people risking life and limb to catch it. 

Given the cheese can reach speeds of up to 70mph, the chase is a futile expedition but a spectacularly bizarre spectacle for onlookers who come from all over the world to compete or watch. The winner is the first to cross a line at the bottom. 

The local council wants nothing to do with the race, its most famous attraction, due to concerns over safety and insurance, but it goes on each year regardless.

Injuries are inevitable in the race that has taken place since the 15th century on the Gloucestershire hill

While its origin is disputed, rolling down the hill after the cheese wheel dates back as far as the 15th century and has been much the same since.

Although in recent years the local cheese supplier was told not to offer up the customary wheel of Double Gloucester but authorities, a Dutch equivalent stepped in. 

To see it in action this year head to Cooper’s Hill for midday on the late spring bank holiday, which this year falls on May 25.

The World Bog Snorkelling Championships in Llanwrtyd Wells, Wales, will be held this year on August 30

BOG SNORKELLING: LLANWRTYD WELLS, WALES

Much like the cheese rolling, those who compete in the World Bog Snorkelling Championships have a bit of a screw loose but also have a ball of a time in the process.

The Welsh town of Llanwrtyd Wells is famed for its wacky events, with the bog swimming on August 30 preceded this year by the Welsh Open Stone Skimming Championships on May 24 and The Whole Earth Man vs Horse Marathon on June 13.

Hundreds compete in the bog snorkelling with participants last year alone coming from France, Germany, Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, USA, Hong Kong and Mali. 

The winner is the fastest to navigate a 180ft peat bog wearing a snorkel and flippers, the only means by which they can propel themselves.

MUD OLYMPICS: BRUNSBUETTEL, GERMANY  

It’s hot, sticky and awesome at the Mud Olympics in Brunsbuettel, near Hamburg in northern Germany, where the annual event is held on the mud flats of the River Elbe. 

Known in German as Wattoluempiade (Tideland Olympics), the Games feature hundreds of competitors not afraid to get down and dirty as they compete in filthy versions of handball, volleyball, football and tug of war, and more.

The event is so popular that the places for most of the sports for this year's games on July 11 were booked out within 50 seconds of entries opening, so it's as exclusive as it is dirty.

Each year Wattoluempiade raises money for the region's cancer sufferers and in total since 2004 it has brought in more than €250,000.

Camel wrestling has taken place in Turkey for more than 2,000 years and attracts crowds of more than 20,000 

CAMEL WRESTLING: SELCUK, TURKEY 

Not for everyone, in particular animal welfare groups who oppose it, or the feint of heart but certainly historic - camel wrestling has been going on in Turkey for more than 2,000 years.

More than 20,000 people gather for the 20,000 people will gather again for the annual Selcuk Efes Camel Wrestling Festival in January, which has run in its current form by Turkey's Ministry of Culture and Tourism since 1984.

The Tulu camels are bred especially for wrestling and much like their human boxing counterparts are matched based on their age and weight to ensure a fair fight. 

What compels the competing male camels to fight? A female camel of course, which is why the main in Selcuk in Turkey’s south coincides with mating season.

A prisoner is bucked off a bull in front of a packed stadium at the Angola Rodeo at Louisiana State Penitentiary

PRISON RODEO: LOUISIANA, USA  

This is precisely what it says on the packet - a rodeo in which prisoners are the stars of the show. 

And it's a far bigger industry and a better spectacle than you’d expect.

Prison rodeos are held throughout the United States but the oldest of its kind is the Angola Rodeo held at Louisiana State Penitentiary, which has been going strong since 1965.

Spectators can buy tickets and attend like any other sporting event, only they’re in a jail so restrictions such as not being allowed to carry weapons apply.  

When the spring rodeo is held on the weekend of April 18 and 19, bull riding will as always be the main event, but some visitors come especially for the arts and crafts market. And yes, the goods are made by the prisoners. 

A bizarre even among the bucking broncos and barrel races is convict poker, which features four prisoners playing poker while an angry bull runs around the arena, sometimes with painful results. 

Funds raised by the rodeo go back into the running of the rodeo and into the Inmate Welfare Fund, which provides inmates with educational and recreational supplies.

Naadam festivals take place throughout Mongolia, with the biggest here in Ulaanbaatar

NAADAM: ULAANBAATAR, MONGOLIA

The 'manly' sports of Mongolia are celebrated at this ancient festival held all over the country from July 11 to 13 and all-comers, including tourists, are welcome as competitors or spectators.

The festival's full name is 'eriin gurvan naadam', meaning 'the three games of men', which are wrestling, horse riding and archery. And despite it being very much a traditional games, it's moving with the times and women can now compete in all but the wrestling.

In 2010, Naadam was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO and a host of travel companies offer guided tours.

HIGHLAND GAMES: DUNOON, SCOTLAND

As Scottish as whisky and haggis, Highland Games are held throughout the country from May to September with as many as 60 sports contested. 

The biggest of them all is the Cowal Highland Gathering over the last weekend in August which has been going in Dunoon since way back in 1894.

Among the most popular events is the caber toss which sees massive guys in kilts throwing a giant log in the air and trying to get the top of it to land nearest to them - they say it originates from when such a technique was used to create bridge crossings over waterways. 

Other events include the throwing of a massive stone, weight throwing contests judges on either distance or height and the sheaf toss in which a pitchfork is used to throw a heavy clump of straw over a bar.  

Pipe bands and Highland dancing competitions along with local food and general frivolity are also important parts of such festivals. 

Entry to the three days of the Snow Polo World Cup in St Moritz is free, but it's not exactly cheap 

SNOW POLO: ST MORITZ, SWITZERLAND

One of the great strengths of sports is their all-inclusive ability to bring different walks of life together on a level playing field - you wouldn't think snow polo is one of those though.

However, since the  Snow Polo World Cup has been held in St Moritz it's be a free event for spectators keen to watch from the stands or the edge of the field. 

This doesn't include accommodation at the relatively pricey resort, or food, or the inevitable champagne that would seem appropriate at such an affair. VIP tickets are also available for sit-down lunches and other perks.  

Still, more than 12,000 people watched the 2015 edition of the cup in January and more are expected for the 2016 event from January 29 to 31.

The event has been held here since 1985 as teams gather from around the globe to play on the idyllic frozen lake for the Cartier Trophy.

With snow-capped mountains of the Engadin Valley as the back drop and all manner of accompanying events, the pricey hotels of the ski resort region are also packed at this time so book well ahead.
