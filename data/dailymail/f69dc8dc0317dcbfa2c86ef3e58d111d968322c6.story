Wimbledon moved swiftly on Tuesday morning to play down suggestions that some early-round matches are soon to be restricted to pay-per-view television channels.

According to The Times, senior BBC executives have discussed the possibility of sharing matches with BT as a way of splitting the costs of broadcasting The Championships.

However, sources at the All England Club quickly pointed out that any decisions about how the matches are broadcast, and on which platforms, are down to how the tournament chooses to sell its rights.

Novak Djokovic claimed the Wimbledon title in 2014 on terrestrial TV and SW19 officials have insisted that the BBC are not in discussions with BT Sport to split some early-round matches with pay-per-view channels

They were quick to dispel fears that a tasty match in the first week featuring Andy Murray, or one of the major international names like Roger Federer or Serena Williams, would be denied to anyone not prepared to pay extra for it.

'Wimbledon has always had a good relationship with the BBC and has a contract with them until 2017,' a Wimbledon spokesman told Sportsmail. 'There has definitely not been any contact with BT.'

The BBC has covered Wimbledon for nearly 80 years and there is a strong emotional bond between the two institutions. There is also, in line with the modern Wimbledon's more hardheaded outlook, recognition of the value of being on terrestrial television.

The power of getting showcased on mainstream TV was shown only this weekend, with a factor in Lewis Hamilton's crushing Sports Personality of the Year win over Rory McIlroy being that he is seen more often on television available to every household.

However, the world is changing quickly and one of the secrets of Wimbledon's ongoing success is that, while maintaining its veneer of tradition, it has never been afraid to change with it.

Nobody knows exactly how the media landscape will be in five years' time, let alone 10, so nothing should be ruled out in the medium to long term. And even the smallest move away from the BBC monopoly of broadcasting the big fortnight in the UK would be an act of major symbolism.

The fact is that only the finals weekend is protected as being free-to-air under the 'crown jewels' designation, but talk of Britain's armchair fans going without coverage if they do not take out a subscription is alarmist.

On the Beeb's side, they are concerned about their budgets in light of licence-fee settlements, and have had arrangements of shared coverage to cut costs with Formula One and the FA Cup. Yet Wimbledon, a one-off event spanning two weeks, is a very different animal.

France's Grand Slam, the French Open at Roland Garros, has also been an event keen to be on free-to-air television, which is one reason it can be seen on ITV in the UK.

As far as Wimbledon is concerned, nothing could be done without the say-so of the hierarchy at SW19, who have shown no sign either in public or private that they are wishing to dramatically alter the status quo.

While they will not be afraid to react to changing circumstances, the British tennis-watching public should not be alarmed at this point.
