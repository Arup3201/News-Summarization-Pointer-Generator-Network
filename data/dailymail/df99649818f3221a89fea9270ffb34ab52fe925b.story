A Lego toy set that shows female scientists hard at work was released by the toy company on Friday and is out of stock.

'The Research Institute' includes three female minifigures: a chemist, an astrologer, and a paleontologist.

Included in the set are pieces that form a telescope, a map of constellations, a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton, a microscope, and a laboratory station.

Sold out: 'The Research Institute' includes an astronomer, a paleontologist and a chemist

In January of this year, a letter shared on Sociological Images revealed that a girl named Charlotte Benjamin criticized Lego for its female-oriented toy options.

'[...] I don't like that there are more Lego boy people and barely any Lego girls,' the 7-year-old wrote. 'Today I went to a store and saw Legos in two sections. The pink (girls) and the boys (blue).

'All the girls did was sit at home, go to the beach, and shop, and they had no jobs but the boys went on adventures, worked, saved people, and had jobs, even swam with sharks.

'I want you to make more Lego girl people and let them go on adventures and have fun ok!?!'

Lego's website says its recently-released set was '[c]reated by real-life geoscientist Ellen Kooijman.'

Elite Daily pointed out that Lego said Kooijman's idea was under review before Sociological Images published Benjamin's letter.

Kooijman tweeted on Friday 'Just bought #LEGO Research Institute set at LEGO Store CPH. So awesome to see your own idea on the shelves!'

The scientist also positively reviewed the Lego set, which was based off of her original designs, on her blog.

Though only five reviews are currently on Lego's product page, those customers also gave the product top marks.

A parent wrote, 'I made my first visit to a Lego store just for this set. It is great to see my daughter really enjoying this set.'

Another customer said 'I would love to see a second scientist set in the future from Ellen Koojiman, she did a beautiful job designing this one. I loved sharing a set with my daughter that focused on women in fields of science.'
