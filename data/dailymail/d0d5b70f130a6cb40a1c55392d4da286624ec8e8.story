They are more likely to be well off, in good health and enjoy a long retirement.

So perhaps it is no surprise that the baby-boom generation has settled in one of the most picturesque parts of the county.

A corner of South Devon has been named as the baby boomer capital of Britain, with a third of residents in the South Hams area aged between 50 and 68.

Situated in an area of outstanding natural beauty, the district is popular with tourists and sought-after among wealthy city dwellers looking for second homes and older people hoping to downsize or retire to the countryside.

Nestled among the rolling countryside and sandy beaches are the towns of Salcombe and Dartmouth, as well as Totnes and Ivybridge, which borders Dartmoor. 

Research published today shows that the South West has the greatest number of residents aged between 50 and 68, with seven of the top 20 areas located in Devon, Dorset or Somerset.

West Somerset is in second place and Torridge in Devon is the next most highly ranked in sixth place.

East Lindsey in Lincolnshire, home to Skegness and Horncastle, comes in third place and North Norfolk, fourth. 

Northern hotspots in the research by pensions group Aegon include South Lakeland – which takes in Kendal and much of the Lake District – and Ryedale, North Yorkshire.

The only Scottish area to make the list is Argyll and Bute in 13th place. The mountainous Welsh region of Powys comes in at number 20.

The area with the lowest number of boomers is the London borough of Tower Hamlets, where they make up just 10 per cent of the population. 

Eight out of the bottom ten districts are in London, the other two being Manchester and Oxford.

There are 14million baby boomers in Britain, according to the Office for National Statistics, accounting for 22 per cent of the population. 

The research was carried out because 2014 is the year in which the last of the generation turns 50.

Many of those living in the hotspots also have long life expectancy. The figures show that those aged 65 in South Hams can expect to live for another 21 years on average. 

Across the top 20, the average life expectancy at 65 is another 20.5 years.

David Macmillan, of Aegon, said: ‘One of the main features of this group is their economic clout, with much of the nation’s wealth concentrated in the hands of a generation that by and large benefited from stable economic conditions, rising property values and defined benefit pensions.

‘Baby boomers are also much healthier so they can expect to enjoy a long retirement.’
