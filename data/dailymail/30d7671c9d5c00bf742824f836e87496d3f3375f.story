This was one of the most poignant moments in modern history. On a bleak January day in 1965, the cranes along the Thames dipped as the launch carrying Winston Churchill’s body passed the giant metal structures on the wharves on its journey from St Paul’s Cathedral.

Commentating for the BBC, Richard Dimbleby described the scene. ‘Across the river, even the jibs of the cranes of Hay’s Wharf are being lowered in a final salute, unique, strangely touching, as they bow forward towards the other side of the river where the coffin is going away on its launch upstream.’

Churchill’s grandson and now a Tory MP, Nicholas Soames, was in the family party aboard the launch. He recalled the spectacle of the dipping arms of the cranes, saying it ‘undid us all’.

The poignant moment the cranes along the Thames dipped during the funeral of Winston Churchill. However, it has now been claimed workers had to be paid to do it due to their anti-Churchill sentiments

The Daily Mail reported: ‘For a week, every detail of the procession arrangements had been written about. And so it was that one gesture, with the added element of surprise, held for many watchers the strongest jolt to unbraced emotions.

‘As the launch carrying the coffin moved upstream, the jibs of cranes dipped in ragged salute. London’s dockers, the last men usually associated with sentimental gestures, expressed their feelings for one who also had a reputation for tough, uncompromising directness.’

But in Wednesday night’s BBC1 documentary, Churchill: The Nation’s Farewell, a docker cast doubt on the spontaneity of the occasion by claiming the workers had to be paid.

John Lynch, who was working in 1965, said: ‘They [the dockers] didn’t like Churchill. I think I can speak for most, they didn’t like him. When they were asked to do it, the atmosphere was “no”. They were paid to do it. We didn’t work Saturday afternoon [the day of the funeral], we wouldn’t have been there.

‘There was a lot of arguments and rows about it. The atmosphere was that Churchill wasn’t a working class person. You’d see him with a cigar in one hand and sometimes a drink in the other, he just didn’t associate with us at all.’

Jeremy Paxman, who presented the programme, said he watched the funeral as a schoolboy on television. He said he was conscious of the comment of his mother (who had driven ambulances in the war) about Churchill: ‘We were so lucky to have him, you know.’

He added: ‘As a child I didn’t question the ritual that marked his death.’

But although the lowering of the cranes was universally seen as a ‘spontaneous bowing in respect’ by dockers in recognition of the great man’s role in saving the country from Nazi tyranny, Paxman said it ‘wasn’t anything of the kind’.

This revelation is a reminder of one of the most shameful aspects of both World War I and World War II: the disgraceful lack of patriotism of many in the Labour movement.

Indeed, even in 1965, there were trades unionists who considered Churchill as a class enemy.

Some of that hatred dated back to 1910, when Churchill was Home Secretary and he sent troops into Tonypandy to control striking miners.

For many trades unionists, the two world wars offered the perfect opportunity to blackmail their employers and the government into giving them better terms and conditions of service, and for expanding union power, with the threat that the country would suffer if the government and their employers didn’t give in. All too often the government did surrender, or pressured private sector employers to do so.

This cave-in was partly down to Churchill’s Minister of Labour, Ernie Bevin, who insisted that — with the Nazis about to put their jackboot on Britain’s throat — there must not be a repeat of the havoc wrought during the Great War by militant strikers.

Indeed, the Left has a shameful history of unpatriotic and self-interested behaviour during war-time and which was often directed at our war leaders.

At the height of World War I, in February 1915, workers in munitions factories on the Clyde had walked out, with industrial unrest spreading to factories in Sheffield and Birmingham.

Later in the year, 15,000 Clyde shipyard workers went on strike again in protest at the compulsory deduction of rent arrears from their pay packets.

Then, in 1917, 200,000 workers in 48 different towns walked out, mainly over wages, but also over food prices, exemptions from military service and what they termed ‘war profiteering’.

And so when war came in again in 1939, the many Communists in the Labour movement felt no urge to support the war effort. Their views were articulated by the late Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, a friend of Ed Miliband’s father Ralph, and then a naïve 22-year-old, that since there was a non-aggression pact between Hitler and their hero, Josef Stalin, it was wrong to attack Nazi Germany.

Meanwhile, rising to prominence in the union movement at the time was Jack Jones, who went on, as Transport and General Workers’ Union leader, to lead his members out on a series of strikes and who was, after his death, exposed as a paid agent for the Soviet Union.

In 1939, he became a full-time union organiser in the car factories of the West Midlands which were being used for the full-time production of tanks, planes and armoured vehicles.

Although Jones had been a Territorial soldier, he was a fervent Communist and fought in the Spanish Civil War.

While men were dying for their country, Jones was establishing a Communist-approved organisation of shop stewards in the factories of his West Midlands bailiwick.

Pathetically, the bosses rolled over and allowed the unions to establish enormous power in their factories — which would linger on after the war and, by the Seventies, effectively kill the British car industry.

Overt Communists went further — and refused to abstain from strike action until 1941 and the Nazi invasion of Russia and their beloved Stalin. Even though strikes had been made illegal in wartime, there were at least 900 in the first few months of the war.

In May 1940, as Hitler launched his attack on the Low Countries and France, the Stalinist Daily Worker — the newspaper of organised Communists in Britain — described the war effort as ‘the Anglo-French Imperialist War Machine’.

Much of the non-Communist union movement, believing their employers were getting enormously rich on the back of the huge armaments programme, saw more and more reason to strike to try to get a bigger share of the money.

In truth, however, their employers were having to pay massively increased income tax, corporation tax and taxes on dividends to help finance the war, so the idea of them profiteering was largely illusory.

That didn’t stop local union organisers demanding more.

During the rest of the war, there were strikes all across the country — in engineering factories, the coal mines, aircraft manufacturers, shipyards, and by bus drivers and conductors.

In 1943, workers at a factory in London making tail-fins for Halifax bombers went on strike and more than 16,000 women and some men walked out of the Rolls-Royce factory in Glasgow — where they should have been making engines for fighter planes.

A key area of industrial unrest during the Second World War was centered around the docks. Pictured here are strikers at Albert Dock in 1945

Another key area of industrial unrest was the docks. In December 1943, 1,000 dockers went on strike in Middlesbrough and 1944 was considered to be an annus horribilis in terms of strike action, with lightning walk-outs in many ports at full stretch preparing for the invasion of Europe.

There were strikes at docks in the west of England, including Plymouth, in January, over the suspension of 11 men who refused to move to another port and work for less pay. No interest was too selfish to put before the good of the country.

And so, it was against this background that the behaviour of the London dockers on January 30, 1965, should be seen and the revelation that they had to be be given money to pay Churchill tribute.

To be fair, many trades unionists were disgusted by the way some of their number behaved during the war, and many unions disowned the unpatriotic extremism of some of their brethren.

But when one realises the full extent of union militancy in Britain’s darkest hour, bolshy London dockers demanding money to show respect to the great leader who took the country through that grave ordeal is, I’m afraid, all too plausible.

Dipping of cranes during Churchill's funeral a moment remembered by all

But the crane operators had to be paid due to anti-Churchill sentiment

It was unsurprising given the lack of patriotism shown by striking workers

There was plenty of industry unrest during the Second World War effort
