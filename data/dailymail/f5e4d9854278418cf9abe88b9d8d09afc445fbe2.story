Pricey: This Pre-Raphaelite artwork which was unearthed among household junk was auctioned by Christie's for a staggering £589,250

When schoolteacher Jane Cordery was told that a dusty painting of an owl she had found in her  attic could sell for about £70,000, she was naturally astonished.

But last week the estimate turned out to be  wrong – by rather a large margin.

The Pre-Raphaelite artwork she unearthed among her household junk was auctioned by Christie’s for a staggering £589,250.

The price has broken the world auction record  for the Victorian artist William James Webbe, who painted the picture in 1856.

His works rarely appear on the market and the highest price paid for one until last week was just £72,000.

Ms Cordery, 66, said of the sale price: ‘It was such a shock. We were not imagining that in our wildest dreams.’

She stumbled across the picture during a long-overdue clear-out at her home in Basingstoke, Hampshire, helped by her 69-year-old partner, James Ravenscroft, and their three grown-up children.

The battered painting emerged from mounds of clothes, books and toys as the family made space around some pipes for a plumber.

It turned out to be a picture that had been exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1856 when renowned critic of the time John Ruskin admired the softness of the bird’s feathers as ‘perhaps inimitable’.

Mr Ravenscroft, who runs a rubber-recycling company, had long ago forgotten receiving the painting as a gift from his mother.

Ms Cordery, an art teacher, emailed a photograph of the owl to Christie’s, where expert Brandon Lindberg immediately saw its potential and the work was valued at £70,000 – as The Mail on Sunday reported last month.

He said: ‘I thought the picture had magic but there wasn’t anything to support a price stronger than we’d suggested in the estimate. Everyone seemed to fall under its spell.’

It was bought by an anonymous British dealer – and now Ms Cordery and her family may treat themselves to a holiday in Africa or Australia.

And if they hadn’t bothered having that clear-out? ‘It doesn’t bear thinking about,’ she said.
