Pro-Russian separatists used tanks, artillery systems and rocket launchers in their fight to capture the airport in the rebel-held Ukrainian city of Donetsk yesterday.

Defence officials said the rebels fired on the terminal, as well as shelling areas nearby, including housing blocks, where four people were killed on Monday.

And that there has been no letup in efforts by pro-Russia separatist fighters to capture the airport, despite a cease-fire agreement being in place for over a month.

Security spokesman Andriy Lysenko said fighting had been reported across the Donetsk region.

More than 3,500 people have been killed in the fighting between government forces and the separatists in the industrial east, according to United Nations figures.

A total of 64 Ukrainian armed service personnel have been killed since the ceasefire came into force on September 5, military prosecutor Anatoly Matios said. Altogether, 956 armed service personnel have been killed in the conflict.

But the continuing conflict has all but fallen off the international radar, as the war to stop ISIS militants reign of terror takes centre stage.

Meanwhile, Ukraine's pro-Western government pressed ahead to secure new laws to tackle top-level government corruption yesterday.

The government is hoping to ease public discontent before an election from which it wants backing for its plan to end a separatist rebellion.

The proposed laws - presented by Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk ahead of an October 26 parliamentary election - will oblige high-level officials in government, the judiciary and law-enforcement to declare their own and their families' assets and financial transactions.

Bribery has been widespread at virtually all levels of Ukrainian government and public life since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. 

International watchdogs say it got worse during the past four years under ousted President Viktor Yanukovich.

Under the legislation, the declared income of civil servants will be measured against lifestyle and property holdings, and an independent agency will investigate discrepancies.

Details about property holdings and shares held by top state officials must be declared on an electronic register for public access. And officials' bank accounts will be open to monitoring by a state committee for possible money-laundering.

The proposed laws, which passed a first reading in parliament yesterday and will have a second and final reading next week, are part of a drive by the pro-Western leadership to raise Ukraine to European standards and distance itself from the culture of its former Soviet master, Russia.

Kiev expects to boost its eligibility to join mainstream Europe despite the conflict in the east and opposition from Moscow, which it accuses of arming pro-Russian rebels that have declared independence.

President Petro Poroshenko is hoping this month's election will produce a strong coalition to support his push for a peace plan dealing with the separatists while keeping Ukraine on a course of European integration.

The anti-corruption push came as Russian President Vladimir Putin celebrated his 62nd birthday in the wilderness of Siberia and his supporters created tributes in his honour.

Putin celebrated his birthday yesterday in the Siberian forest some 185-250miles from the nearest populated area, his press secretary said.
