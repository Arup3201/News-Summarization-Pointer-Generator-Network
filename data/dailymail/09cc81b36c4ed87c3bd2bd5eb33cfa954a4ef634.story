Tesco has been accused of exploitation after raising the price of a must-have Christmas toy, the Furby, by nearly £6. 

With more than two weeks until Christmas, huge demand for the re-launched Nineties toy has left many stores out of stock, and others running low. 

Tesco still has supplies, but while last month the Furby was selling for £48.99, it now costs £54.97.

Must-have Furby: Tesco has been accused of exploitation after raising the price of the popular Christmas toy by £6 to £54.97 as many stores run low on stock

Jasmine Birtles, of money-saving website Moneymagpie.com, said: ‘It is a cynical move. They are cashing in on parents desperate to get the must-have toy for Christmas.’

Tesco refused to explain the rise but said: ‘Our price is among the        lowest of any retailer.’

Toys R Us’s prices have also fluctuated. It had dropped the price from £59.99 to £49.99. But yesterday the price was up again – to £57.99. 

Toys R Us said: ‘This is not about cashing in. We had to lower prices to keep up with market trends but are back at our normal price now.’

Fluctuating prices: Tesco refused to explain the rise. Toys R Us's price have also fluctuated with its price dropped from £59.99 to £49.99 but yesterday the price was up again to £57.99

Prices at John Lewis have ranged from £49.79 to £59.95 due to its store policy of matching other retailers’ best prices.  Yesterday it was £54.97.

All three stores sell the Furby, left,  at below the recommended retail price (RRP) of £59.99.

Prices at other stores are similar but have remained consistent.

Meanwhile, Furbies are being sold online at inflated prices. On eBay some are listed at £150, and Amazon vendors are asking for up to £179.99 – three times the RRP.

Furbies first caused a sensation in 1998, selling 40 million in two years. The new toy is one of this year’s 13 top presents, according to the Toy Retailers’ Association.
