Lisa Steed, pictured, admitted in violating agency procedures

A police officer who was named 'Trooper of the Year 2007' for making more than 200 DUI arrests could see her cases overturned after she admitted violating standard procedure.

Lisa Steed 
admitted in court this week that she had removed her microphone during a 2010 DUI stop so her superior wouldn't know what she was doing.

This is not the first time Steed's actions on DUI stops have got her into trouble.

In 2009, a shocking police car dashcam recording
caught her tasering a terrified man after he refused to get out
of his car asking to call his lawyer. The man was later found to have been sober.

A Facebook group has been set up calling
on the police to fire Steed called; 'End Abusive Police: Fire UHP 
Officer Lisa Steed.' It has over 120 supporters.

'The cumulative facts may well have a significant ripple effect across every case she's touched,' Salt Lake City attorney Joseph Jardine told ABCNews.com.

'This could become the basis for overturning multiple convictions in the past.'

Jardine is representing Theron Alexander, who said Steed violated procedure when she administered a breathalyzer test before a field sobriety test in March 2010.

'The credibility of an investigating 
officer is paramount. If you can't trust the cop at their word, there's 
very little left that you can trust with an investigation,' Jardine 
said.

Steed admitted that she had removed her microphone and left in in the patrol car during the incident so she could perform an unauthorized action, according to ABC News. 

'She specifically stated [Tuesday] that she took the microphone off so her superior wouldn't know what she was doing,' Jardine said.

'We're concerned that she may have a tendency to stretch the truth when it suits her purposes. Our objective is to probe her credibility.'

Trooper Steed's statements came while she took the witness stand in the DUI court case.

Steed's attorney Greg Skordas told ABC that the incident is not a reflection of his client's credibility.

'It doesn't affect her credibility. It affects the way she does things, her ability to follow instructions,' Skordas told ABC. 'It doesn't mean she's dishonest.'

Skordas claimed that Steed was simply trying to give the motorist that she had pulled over 'the benefit of the doubt' by skipping straight to the breathalyzer test and not having them get out of the car.

'It wasn't anyone she knew. I think she was just being overly sensitive,' Skordas said.

'There wasn't any bad intent. It was one of those, no good deed goes unpunished.'

Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim 
Gill said his office has been investigating several dozen pending DUI 
cases involving Steed after complaints arose.

The 2009 taser recording showed the officer shouting at Ryan Jones to get out of his car, when he asked to call his lawyer first.

She quickly  threatens him with a taser saying: 'If you don't get out now, you're getting tasered in two second.'

She then threatens to get a police dog to 'rip him out of the car'.

Jones can be heard calmly saying, "Ma'am, please don't shoot me with a Taser,'.

However, Steed ignores his plea and zaps him as he is sitting in his car. He can be heard screaming in agony in the recording and then begging her not to do it again before he is zapped a second time.

When Jones was eventually tested, his blood alcohol level was a 0.03, well below the legal limit.

The case was settled in November 2011 when the state paid Jones $40,000 without admitting wrongdoing.

Of the case, Skordas said, she was reprimanded and had moved on.
