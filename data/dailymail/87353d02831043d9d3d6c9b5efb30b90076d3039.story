After a flirtation with TV stardom, White Dee’s subsequent fame has been based more on her apparently comfortable lifestyle while still claiming state handouts.

But now the party could be over for the woman who became a national celebrity after appearing on the Channel 4 show Benefits Street.

Her agent Barry Tomes is due to meet officials from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) today to discuss the single mother’s situation.

However, all is not lost for the star of James Turner street, as it emerged she has set her sights on a career as a model by becoming the face of a 'plus-size' clothing range.

On the eve
 of crunch talks between her agent and benefits chiefs to find out if 
her handouts will be cut, the reality TV star is already making plans 
for a new source of income.

She's
 hoping to find work promoting a plus size clothing brand as she looks 
for ways to cash in on her famous face and turn her hand to advertising.

Mr Tomes said: 'I'd like to get Dee introducing 
clothes for larger size women, or promoting supermarkets, I mean she's a
 mum, she's had to learn to shop on a budget.'

Yesterday,
 Mr Tomes denied reports that his client, whose real name is Deirdre 
Kelly, has already had her benefits cut, but added: ‘They [the DWP] 
might be able to tell us they are stopping her money while she is 
earning. They could then  restart if Dee cannot work.

‘I
 have informed the DWP of whatever she has earned. It could be that she 
has a letter on its way warning that some benefits are going to be 
stopped. I hope the DWP can provide clarity at this meeting.’

After
 taking part in the controversial documentary about one of Britain’s 
most benefit-dependent streets, James Turner Street in Birmingham, Miss 
Kelly has been revelling in the perks of her newfound celebrity.

There
 have been lucrative tabloid newspaper interviews, promotional 
appearances at events, meals at four-star hotels and even a free trip to
 Majorca, where she was pictured posing with a £500 bottle of Moet and 
downing shots and pints.

The 42-year-old angered taxpayers after insisting she would continue claiming until the Government stops her.

Dee has amassed a big fan base since appearing in Benefits Street and her agent has said she could quickly become a millionaire once she is well enough to work

She appeared at Birmingham Pride this weekend, where fans flocked to have photos taken with her

Modelling is just the latest in a string of possible careers she's 
lined up, despite insisting she's currently too depressed to work.

However,
 Rivkie Baum, editor of Slink Magazine, a fashion and lifestyle 
publication for women with curves, said: 'While I admire Dee's tenacity 
and thought she actually came across well on the show, playing her 
motherly role to the street, I think trying to make it as a plus size 
model or fashion voice may just be a step too far.

'In
 order to be the face of a brand one would expect the chosen face to 
either be aspirational or at least have a great sense of style.

'Even
 though Dee has had to learn to shop on a budget and would be easily 
relatable to for a number of women, she doesn't quite embody the dream 
that the world of fashion, both high-street and high end try to sell.'

A public campaign was launched to get Dee - pictured after returning home from a recent trip to Magaluf (left) and receiving a gift from a fan (right) - wearing a bra after she appeared unsupported in Benefits Street

Nevertheless, Mr Tomes 
insists that, even though Dee is not currently bringing in money, he 
sees his work as an investment in his client.  He has been quoted as 
saying  she will become 'a millionaire' soon after she's well enough to 
take paid work.

He was given an insight into his client's apparent popularity when she appeared at the Birmingham Pride event this weekend.

Fans
 cheered her arrival and flocked around for photographs and autographs 
as she was treated like a VIP at the West Midlands festival.

The
 row over whether she should still be on handouts exploded last month 
when she was spotted downing pints and drinking shots on a 'Carnage 
Magaluf' bar crawl.

After
 she insisted the trip was purely a way of getting her well enough to 
work, Labour MP Simon Danczuk slammed her as a 'poster girl' for people 
who want to 'get famous for doing nothing'.

The
 DWP meeting comes a week after David Cameron warned that the mother of 
two could lose her benefits if she is found to be earning a lot of money
 from her promotional work.

She
 receives £214 a week from a combination of employment and support 
allowance – formerly known as incapacity benefit – child tax credit and 
child benefit, plus £500 a month housing benefit.

Mr
 Tomes met his client in a pub beer garden last Friday to discuss the 
DWP meeting. He said the DWP had asked for it to take place at a secret 
location to avoid a ‘media scrum’.

He
 said officials are meeting him rather than Miss Kelly because 
technically he is her employer. ‘Any work Dee does that involves payment
 sees the money go to me,’ Mr Tomes said. ‘I then pay the client.’

Miss
 Kelly claims her depression has stopped her from working full-time 
since she was sacked from her job with Birmingham City Council in 2007, 
after she was convicted of stealing £13,000.

The
 DWP said it does not comment on individual cases but added that if a 
claimant is being paid for work in kind it can stop payments.
