Hundreds of NYPD officers cheered as the hero detective who was shot by a fugitive pedophile during a shootout in New York City left hospital today.

Detective Mario Muniz, 45, a married father from Queens, left Bellevue Hospital on Wednesday in a wheelchair pushed by his patrol partner, Joseph Trovato.

He had undergone surgery after being shot in the abdomen. Detective Muniz, who was recently promoted, said: 'Thank you to the hospital, the NYPD, my family. I feel great.'

Hero NYPD detective Mario Muniz, 45, left Bellevue hospital in Manhattan on Wednesday to the cheers of hundreds of cops who had turned up. He was injured in a shootout in the West Village on Monday with a wanted pedophile

The NYPD had turned out in force to see the injured detective, who is a married father

Spiro Frangos, chief of trauma, emergency surgery and critical care at Bellevue Hospital told DNAInfo that the officer was 'very lucky' that the bullet had bypassed his vital organs.

Muniz and two U.S. marshals were wounded on Monday when they tried to arrest suspect, Charles Richard Mozdir, in a smoke shop in Greenwich Village.

Mozdir was killed in the confrontation. Both the marshals - Ryan Westfield and Pat Lin - were released from the hospital on Tuesday.

Muniz was shot at least twice, in the stomach below his protective vest and in the chest. Police Commissioner William Bratton said on Monday the detective's protective vest may have saved his life.

Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives Endowment Association, speaking outside Bellevue, said that once Muniz goes home to recuperate: 'The reality of what could have happened will set in.'

Palladino added: 'I'm going to renew my message to all the criminals in this city: It's not open season on these detectives ... because our mission is to get the job done.'

Detective Muniz left Bellevue Hospital around midday on Wednesday. A surgeon said he was 'very lucky' the bullet had missed his vital organs

A $1 million bench warrant was issued 
for Mozdir's arrest in 2012 after he skipped an arraignment in San Diego
 Superior Court on child sexual assault charges.

In
 addition to multiple counts of lewd acts, Mozdir also had been charged 
with attempting to dissuade a witness from prosecution, the criminal 
complaint said. He had posted $250,000 bail.

Mozdir's
 case had recently been featured on CNN's The Hunt with John Walsh. 
Mozdir was accused of abusing the boy while baby-sitting him, and 
authorities later found evidence of child pornography and bestiality on 
his cellphone and computers, according to the show's website, quoting 
federal authorities.

Mozdir was gunned down in broad daylight after he pulled a weapon on the detective and U.S. marshall team who tried to serve him with a warrant.

Thanks to a tip from his boss, authorities tracked him to a 
Greenwich Village smoke shop, sources told the New York Daily News.

Steve Zhik, who owns Smoking Culture 
on West Fourth Street, alerted cops that Mozdir was working as a 
salesman at his store after seeing an episode on CNN series The Hunt 
about the wanted man last week.

A
 woman Mozdir was dating also watched the show and was so disgusted she 
decided to give him up to police. She called authorities, and gave them 
his cellphone number which police pinged to confirm he was in the area.

Mozdir
 had been the target of a nationwide manhunt after a family friend 
accused him of molesting her son while the child lay sick in bed in 
Coronado, California, in June 2012.

It
 was the second child molestation case against him, investigators said. 
Child porn and bestiality videos were also allegedly found in his home.

But
 instead of facing charges he fled. His car was found abandoned in 
Darien, Georgia, later that June. It turned out he had been hiding in 
Key West, Florida, and just months ago moved to Manhattan.

Cops: Heavily armed police investigate the shooting, which left Charles Mozdir dead and one of the officers shot three times. That officer, Mario Muniz, was celebrated Tuesday by both his mother and the relieved mother of the then 7-year-old boy Mozdir molested

The shooting happened just after 1pm at a West Village store not far from New York University.

The
 store sells items including bongs, cigarettes and cigars and it is 
believed that Mozdir was behind the counter and working when the 
authorities showed up.

Two
 U.S. Marshals and an NYPD detective entered the shop to serve him with a warrant when he pulled a revolver 
on them. He also had 20 spare rounds of ammunition in his pockets.

Emergency workers transported all four victims to Bellevue Hospital, where the suspect died. 

Mayor Bill De Blasio said on Monday that the officers were recovering and 'in good spirits'. He added that the detective's life had been saved by his bullet-proof vest.

Jerry DeWitt, who lives on the West Village street where the shooting took place, arrived minutes after the shoot-out and described the scene as 'pure chaos'.

'You expect anything to happen here but not this,' he told MailOnline.

Another
 resident, Christine Rucci, who lives opposite the shop, told MailOnline
 that at first she heard a loud noise and when she looked out her front 
window she noticed the shop was surrounded by a number of unmarked cars 
and there was a helicopter overhead.

She
 estimated that there are four elementary schools nearby. 'What is 
really upsetting is that he was a sex offender and that he had a gun,' 
she told MailOnline.

Ms Rucci, who has lived in the area for 25 years said it used to feel very safe - especially when Michael Bloomberg's daughter lived in the same building - but that there had also been a shooting on Mother's Day on the same street.

A $1 million bench warrant was issued for Mozdir's arrest on June 15, 2012, after he skipped an arraignment in San Diego Superior Court on child sexual assault charges, according to Steve Walker, a spokesman for the San Diego County district attorney. He had posted $250,000 bail.

Mozdir had been wanted on five counts of lewd acts upon a child younger than 14 and a charge of attempting to keep a witness from prosecuting a crime, according to the criminal complaint.

The one-time wedding photographer has
 been accused by a family friend of molesting her seven-year-old son 
while babysitting him in Coronado, near
 San Diego.

After he 
disappeared, investigators had found sickening images of child 
pornography and bestiality on his cell phone and computers at his home.

He was considered armed and dangerous
 since a roommate told police that Mozdir, armed with two guns, 
threatened to kill himself and a victim's father.

Law enforcement had hunted him from California to Mexico to the deep south and finally to New York City.

According to CNN, after the episode of The Hunt featuring Mozdir aired 
authorities received a tip that he was working at a restaurant in 
Manhattan, but the information didn't pan out.

After CNN 
re-aired Mozdir's episode on Sunday night, another tip came in that 
resulted in an address for Mozdir, according to John Walsh.

Mayor Bill de Blasio says the three are 
stable and that, 'We pray everything we are hearing is true and that 
these officers will be OK in the long run.'

Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said the fugitive task force seeks absconders from other states.

Coronado police said in a statement: 
‘Our thoughts and prayers go out to the brave officers assigned to the 
U.S. Marshall’s fugitive task force who were wounded in a shootout with 
suspected child molester Charles Mozdir in New York this morning.

'Mozdir
 was wanted in a 2012 child molest case in Coronado. He failed to appear
 in court on the charges and a $1 million warrant was issued.’

Mozdir allegedly molested a young boy
 whose parents were friends of his while he served as a babysitter in 
June 2012, reported CNN in The Hunt.

He molested the boy while his mother slept in bed next to him, his father told CNN.

Child pornography was recovered at Mozdir's home, U.S. Marshals Service deputy Brian Grimes told CNN. 

Mozdir was later arrested and made bail, he then skipped an arraignment and went on the run.

Mozdir allegedly molested a second boy in a similar incident, the channel said.

Mozdir's scent was found by a hound on a highway and his car was recovered in Georgia, but investigators were unable to find the alleged child molester, CNN said.

In 2013 , authorities said ‘Mozdir made threats to take his own life and threats have been made to the victim’s family.’

The violence recalls a deadly shootout that left a gunman and two auxiliary New York City police officers dead on another Greenwich Village street in March 2007.

That gunman, David Garvin, killed a bartender, according to police, and then turned crowded streets packed with storied taverns into a shooting gallery.

Unarmed volunteer officers Eugene Marshalik and Nicholas Todd Pekearo were killed.
