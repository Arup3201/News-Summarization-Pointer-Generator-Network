The 26-year-old is expected to be sidelined for several months, ruling him out of the start of the La Liga campaign in August.

Mexico led for most of the second half thanks to Giovani Dos Santos's goal, but they were undone by two late goals.

Wesley Sneijder pulled the Dutch level in the 88th minute before Klaas-Jan Huntelaar slotted home a penalty won by Robben deep into injury time.
