Shane, 25, needed emergency treatment and 40 stitches after the attack left him with a gaping hole in his hand

The father-of-one was thrown to the 
ground by an unknown man after he started becoming aggressive towards 
his girlfriend when she accused him of pushing into the queue.

When Shane stepped in to defend his girlfriend, the 6ft-tall attacker sank his teeth into his hand before throwing him outside onto a busy road and straight into the path of a bus.

Shane lost a lot of blood and repeatedly blacked out during the attack.

The attack happened in a busy local chip shop near to his home in Romford, Essex.

Shane said he and his girlfriend had gone to the Station Fish and Kebab Bar for a late bite to eat after a night out.

'It started when my girlfriend said, 'Excuse me, you jumped the queue,' he said.

'I thought he'd just go, 'Sorry, you go first', but he was being really aggressive and told her he didn't care.

'I asked him not to speak to her like that and he attacked me.

'He ended up on top of me on the floor, pretty much bit the top of my finger off and bit a chunk out of the palm of my hand.

He added: 'From there the fight went outside.

'He was still on top of me and that's when the bus came up and ran over my hand.

'I was going in and out of consciousness', he said.
