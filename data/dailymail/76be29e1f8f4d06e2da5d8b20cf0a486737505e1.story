On first sight the Lego construction could be any family picnic, but look closer and you might see some clues to a very Royal connection.

This unusual display is actually a miniature Buckingham Palace, complete with garden party to celebrate Prince George's first birthday yesterday.

The attraction ties in with the Prince's birthday party and the gilded guest list that included most of the Royal Family - and it has gone on display at Legoland Windsor.

Spot one's Royal party goers? Can you guess which family members are created here?

As the Queen joined Kate and William to celebrate the toddler's birthday with Prince Harry, the Middleton clan and others at Kensington Palace, visitors to Legoland will be treated to a brick by brick Lego version of the event.

The first birthday party features a recreation of Buckingham Palace, a tiny Prince George, traditional birthday bunting and balloons, tiny jellies and ice cream, and even a tiny Lego birthday cake.

The miniature Lego birthday cake has one candle marking his age and those clever people at Legoland also made some miniature party food creations at the tea party complete with red white and blue balloons.

Lego versions of Prince George's parents, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, both sets of grandparents, Queen Elizabeth, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Harry, Aunt Pippa, and his dog Lupo were also created.

The display is part of Legoland's world-famous Miniland, and will be on display throughout the summer.

George's first birthday party was organised by Carole Middleton and had a Peter Rabbit theme.Â  During the party, guests tucked into a special cake made by George's Spanish nanny, Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo.

Grandparents Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were notable absentees but did get George a present - a giant red squirrel soft toy - which luckily doesn't feature in the Legoland attraction as it would dwarf the Royal youngster.
