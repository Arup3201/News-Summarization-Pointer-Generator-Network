A tattoo-addict has smashed the world record for the most piercings in one sitting - enduring more than 4,500 during a gruelling eight-hour session.

Matthew Menczyk, 30, had 4550 surgical needles pierce the skin of his arms and back - breaking the previous record by an impressive 650.

Looking as if a layer of armour has been woven into his skin, Mr Menczyk fought through hours of agony and bleeding to claim the title of 'Most Surgical Needle Piercings in One Session'.
