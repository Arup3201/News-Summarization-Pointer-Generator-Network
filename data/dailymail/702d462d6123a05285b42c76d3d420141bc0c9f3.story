Hermino Padilla's lifeless body was pulled from the tank in Florida on Saturday, 18 hours after he was first reported missing at 2 a.m.

A West Palm Beach water treatment facility employee died in a tragic accident after falling through a grate into a sewage tank.

Hermino Padilla Jr's., 48, lifeless body was pulled from the tank in Florida on Saturday, 18 hours after he was first reported missing at 2 a.m.

Divers found his body in a pipe  after he plummeted into an open tank of sewage.

His son, Steven Padilla told WESH-Orlando his father often worked long hours at the West Palm Beach water treatment facility, but had no clue where he was after he'd gone missing. 

He waited outside locked gates while police and rescue workers searched the 100-acre property off of Roebuck Road and Florida's Turnpike.

He said: '(Investigators) saw the grate was missing, they could only conclude the grate sort of became unlatched and went with him in the water and dumped him in there.' 

'Of course I'm upset. Something could have been and should have been done about it.

'You hope he'd just wake up the next day and everything was fine but it's not,' Padilla added.

His son described his father as a kind-hearted, giving, person.  

West Palm Beach police spokeswoman Lori Colombino said: 'This is still an open investigation and we will not be providing an additional statement at this time.'

City spokesman Elliot Cohen said: 'The collective prayers of an entire city are going out to his (Hermino Padillo Jr.'s) family. 

'Mayor Muoio has ordered all departments to reinforce safety protocols for all high-risk jobs across the city.
