An elderly lollipop man has been knocked down and killed by a car outside the primary school where he had worked for more than 13 years.

Raymond Elsmore, 82, had been on his usual patrol near to Queen's Inclosure Primary School in Waterlooville, Hampshire, when the tragedy happened yesterday.

The pensioner, who was wearing reflective clothing and carrying his traffic sign at the time, was hit by a Nissan Micra.

'Shocked': Mr Elsmore's family said they were 'devastated' by the loss of a 'fun-loving, friendly and caring man'

Heartbreak: Parents and children left flowers and letters in tribute to Mr Elsmore at the scene of the tragedy

A witness said he was still conscious at the scene and told his daughter 'I'll see you at the hospital' before being taken away in an air ambulance.

He was rushed to hospital but later died from head injuries.

The collision took place at 3pm, just before the end of the school day, after Mr Elsmore had helped a parent cross the road to pick up a child from the school.

A 21-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving at the scene and later released on bail until January 31.

In a statement Mr Elsmore's family said: 'We are shocked and devastated to have lost Ray who meant so much to so many.

'We feel so lucky to have shared our life with someone so fun-loving, happy, friendly and caring.

'We are very touched by eveyone's kind tributes.'

Eye witness and local resident Richard Donsey, 62, said: 'When Mr Elsmore’s daughter arrived at the scene he was still conscious.

'Ray told her he would see her when she got to the hospital, these were the last words he spoke to his daughter which is just so sad.

'He was the best lollipop man ever and no matter what he was always there making sure the children crossed the road safely.'

Tragic: Mr Elsmore was apparently conscious after the accident and told his daughter, who was at the scene, 'I'll see you at the hospital'

Appeal: Police are asking anyone who witnessed the crash to come forward with information

'He was a really top guy and there is no one that could possibly have a bad word to say about him.'

The retired construction site manager added: 'We’ve started a petition to get a proper crossing on this busy road but it’s all too late now really.

'I’ve know him for years, I’d talk to him when I walked past with my dog which he would always give a pat to, he was such a lovely man.'

Sergeant Darren Ord, of the Road Death Investigation team, said: 'At the time of the collision, Mr Elsmore was not escorting any children.

'Many people in the local community are concerned about the collision and I’d like to reassure them we are continuing our investigation.

'We are keeping an open mind as we seek to establish exactly what happened.'

Queen’s Inclosure Primary School released a touching tribute in memory of their much-loved lollipop man.

It read: 'Following the tragic incident yesterday, we are all completely devastated by the death of our lollipop man, Ray Elsmore.

'He was a valued member of our school community for over 13 years - and had helped hundreds of our children cross the road safely in all weathers.

'Mr Elsmore was well loved by many children and their families and will be very sadly missed.

'Our thoughts and prayers go to his relatives and friends at this terrible time.'

Further tributes poured in from local residents who spoke fondly of Mr Elsmore, who they had known for a long time.

Joel Hayes, 19, said: 'Whenever I walked my two dogs I stopped to chat to him on the side of the road about small things like the weather.

'He was such a lovely guy and I had known him for about four years, he didn’t have a bad word to say about anyone.

'This has come as a tremendous shock and it’s horrible to think about.

'Devastated': A statement from Queen's Inclosure Primary School where Mr Elsmore had worked for more than 13 years said he will be 'very sadly missed'

'He always waved to families who were picking up their children from school.'

Chris Bray, 40, said the much-loved pensioner had often made an effort to stop and chat with his son, Daniel.

Mr Bray said: 'You couldn’t help but speak to him because he was such a nice, sweet man.

'He would wave to all the cars that went by - he will be terribly missed.'

Dozens of flowers and messages were later left by a lamppost in the road.

One heartfelt message read: 'Thank you for helping us and many others across the busy road on the way to school for many years.

'You will be dearly missed by all the local people who knew what a kind gentleman you were. Never forgotten.'

Another message from a child read: “Dear lollipop man, I’m so sad I couldn’t do any more for you.

'You’ll be sorely missed by everyone, you sir were a legend. RIP.'

A further message from a thankful parent read: 'Thank you for looking after our children cross the road, you will be sorely missed.''Our dearest sweetest uncle Ray you are so loved by us all, you are not just and uncle and great-uncle Ray.

'You are a legend to us and everyone who had the pleasure of knowing you.

RIP, sleep well.'Fran Unwin, manager of the nearby Plough and Barleycorn pub, said: 'This is very sad news. The bar staff said some people came into the pub after seeing the collision as they were in shock.'
