The government is looking at ways to counter Islamic State propaganda after it was revealed terrorists are serving up pancake recipes online to win over new followers.

A national security review report has revealed terror groups such as Islamic State are using 'highly targeted messages to appeal to vulnerable audiences'.

The report gives the example of IS releasing a pancake recipe 'designed to feed jihadists after a hard day of fighting'.

A rough translation of the recipe website says the pancakes are quickly and easily prepared and best eaten with honey.

'Can supply to mujahideen (fighters) before scurrying out onto the fighting fronts and extend the mujahideen energy and power, God willing.

'Serve them to heroes.'

Australian jihadi Mohamed Elomar is just one of many who has been accused of trying to recruit Australians to join Islamic State

Prime Minister Tony Abbott detailed the terror groups' ploys on Monday during a landmark national security address.

IS has also released a guidebook to help young mothers raise a 'Mujahid child'.

'Don't wait until they are seven to start, for it may be too late by then,' it says.

The federal government is looking at ways to counter such propaganda, in consultation with Islamic communities.

Islamic State first issued the pancake recipes in 2014 along with a recipe for balls of date mush.

They instructed the pancakes should be made with egg, sugar, oil, salt, milk and flour.

Militants are told that the date balls are best eaten during an 'intermission in battle' with coffee or water.

'They contain significant calories, and will extend the power and strength of the Mujahideen, God willing,' the post says. 

Ingredients: four tablespoons of flour, one egg, teaspoon of salt and a cup of milk

The recipe instructs cooks to put all the ingredients in a bowl and stir them well

Cooks are then told to pour a little oil into the pan and warm to a medium hear, before pouring in the pancake mixture. When the pancake starts bubbling it should be flipped over

Once brown on both sides the pancake is ready to be served. Militants suggest dishing it up with maple syrup or honey

The cookbook was published by the Zora Foundation, an arm of ISIS that is seeking to recruit women to the cause, and give advice to those already in Syria and Iraq.

Their slogan is 'preparing for the honour of jihad' and their online accounts - which post only in Arabic - have attracted thousands of followers so far.

ISIS strictly forbid women from taking part in combat, and so the propaganda films instead focus on how to assist jihad through 'feminine manual labour'.

Among the suitable tasks given to women is producing and editing slideshows and film footage, in an effort to make more propaganda, and participating in 'jihadi science' - which is not explained further.

It is not known exactly how many women have joined ISIS, but it is common for men signing up to take their wives to fight alongside them.

There are two all-female brigades operating in the de-facto capital of Raqqa, in Syria, including al-Khanssaa, which is thought to be lead by Aqsa Mahmood, 20, a British female jihadi.

The brigade, whose job is to patrol the streets of Raqqa enforcing strict Sharia law, is thought to include up to sixty female radicals from the UK. 

The ingredients needed for power and strength increasing 'date balls' include dates, butter and flour

On Monday, the PM announced many Australians who fight for the Islamic State will be stripped of their citizenship. The dramatic pledge came as a review released today revealed more than thirty Australians have returned home after fighting for jihadist causes overseas.

The government is also exploring taking away some of the rights of jihadists who are sole Australian citizens, Mr Abbott said. 

That could include restricting their access to welfare payments, to consular help and their ability to leave or return to Australia. 

'The Islam-ist death-cult has declared war on the world,' Mr Abbott said.

'We cannot allow bad people to use our good nature against us.' He added that Sydney siege gunman Man Monis had been given the benefit of the doubt too many times, including with citizenship. 

Mr Abbott also confirmed that ASIO is currently investigating thousands of terror leads and suspects, with 400 people deemed high risk. 

'That's more than double the number a year ago,' Mr Abbott told the assembled crowd, which included top national security officers from the Australian Federal Police.
