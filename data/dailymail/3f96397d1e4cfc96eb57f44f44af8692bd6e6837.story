A violent thug who killed a vulnerable man with one punch will not have his 'lenient' four-year sentence extended, leading judges have ruled.

Lewis Gill, 21, was convicted to just four years in prison over the death of Asperger's sufferer Andrew Young, whose mother branded the sentence 'an absolute joke'.

It means he could be released within two years.

Deluged with complaints, Attorney General Dominic Grieve called for an immediate review into what he deemed an 'unduly lenient' sentence.

But today, Lord Justice Treacy told the Court of Appeal the sentence is 'reasonable' and not 'unduly lenient'.

The shocking incident took place on a busy street in Bournemouth when Mr Young, 40, warned Victor Ibitoye that riding on the pavement was dangerous.

When the conversation ended Lewis Gill, who was with Mr Ibitoye, punched Mr Young, taking him by surprise.

Distressing CCTV footage shows the Asperger’s sufferer toppling back on to the road, violently striking his head.

 who has a conviction for handling stolen goods as well as robbery, then

Passers-by came to Mr Young’s aid but he died the following day in Southampton Hospital. His mother Pamela was at his bedside.

The
 sentence was imposed by Judge Keith Cutler, who was criticised for his 
handling of the inquest into the gangster Mark Duggan, whose shooting by
 police sparked the riots of 2011.

Distraught: Pamela Young, Andrew Young's mother, branded the sentence 'an absolute joke'

Speaking outside Salisbury Crown Court
 in February, Andrew Young's mother Pamela said: ‘You can see Andrew 
didn’t cause Lewis Gill any harm.

‘I
 wish that awful man who took my son away had pleaded not guilty so he 
would have got a longer sentence. The sentence is an absolute joke.

‘I’m a committed Christian but I think that if someone takes a life they should be prepared to forfeit their own.’

She said that too few killers served full sentences.

Lord Justice Treacy made headlines in 2010 after becoming the first judge to support secret arrests.

He presided over the first criminal case without a jury for 400 years.

In 2011, he presided over the trial of Gary Dobson and David Norris for the racially aggravated murder of Stephen Lawrence.

With today's ruling, Lord Justice Treacy supported Judge Keith Cutler, who handed Lewis Gill a four-year sentence for punching Andrew Young.

Mr Cutler is the controversial judge who presided over the case of Mark Duggan, the gangster who was shot twice by police marksmen, sparking the London riots of 2011.

Mr Cutler ordered the court to hold a 20-second silence for the 'regrettable loss of a young life'.

Today, Victims’ Commissioner Baroness Newlove told MailOnline: 'This was a horrific act of violence and my heart truly goes out to Andrew’s family and friends.

'I think it was right that the Court of Appeal looked at this case again and I note with particular interest Lord Justice Treacy’s comments on the consideration of this wider issue.

'This is an area which I will discuss in one of my regular meetings with the judiciary on sentencing matters.'

Supporting Judge Cutler, Lord Treacy said: 'We have concluded that the sentence imposed below is not one which can be described as unduly lenient.

'Indeed,
 it seems to us that the sentence imposed was one within the reasonable 
range available to the trial judge, properly weighing the relevant 
factors and the guidance of this court.'

His controversial words come weeks after convicted Gill's mother dismissed his crime as ‘no big deal’.

In a display of callous indifference, Sherron O’Hagan said she did not know ‘what all the fuss was about’.

The
 41-year-old mother of three told the Mail: ‘It was just an accident. 
It’s not a big deal. This will all be forgotten tomorrow. He’s my son, 
what do you want me to say? He didn’t mean to kill him and that’s that.’

Mrs O’Hagan, who was not married to Gill’s father Richard McKenzie, added: ‘This story will be the lining of chips tomorrow. I just don’t understand what all the fuss is about.’

During the hearing, Mr Grieve outlined a number of 'aggravating factors' in the case.

He said the victim was vulnerable because he suffered from Asperger's syndrome, telling the court: 'It is accepted that the offender had no means of knowing the detail of the victim's condition, but it was clear from the victim's unusual behaviour, as seen on the CCTV, that he was vulnerable.'

The punch was delivered with deliberation in a place where a 'great many' members of the public were present.

Mitigating factors included a guilty plea at an early stage, the expression of remorse, Gill's relatively young age, and the fact that the offence was not planned or premeditated.

Concluding, Lord Treacy said: 'We readily understand that this is the sort of case that arouses public concern.

'If there are public concerns going beyond this case then it may well be appropriate for the wider issue to be the subject of detailed consideration and consultation by the Sentencing Council in the future.

'Unduly lenient': Attorney General Dominic Grieve had called for a review into the sentence he deemed 'lenient'

'It is open to the Secretary of State for Justice or other interested bodies to invite the Sentencing Council to do so.'

Speaking after the hearing, Mr Grieve said: 'This was a case of gratuitous, unprovoked violence.

'It was broad daylight when Lewis Gill delivered a very deliberate, forceful and vicious punch.

'I asked the Court of Appeal to look again at this sentence as I believed it was unduly lenient.

'They have taken the view that the four-year sentence imposed on Lewis Gill should not be increased and I accept their decision entirely.'
