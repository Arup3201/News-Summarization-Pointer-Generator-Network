The majority of babies will be born out of wedlock within three years, new figures suggest.

The decline in marriage has led to a huge change in the way children are brought up in a generation.

A record 47.5 per cent of babies were born to unmarried mothers in 2012, compared to just 8.4 per cent 40 years earlier.

Record rise: Dramatic social change has seen the proportion of babies born to unmarried parents soar from just 11.8 per cent in 1980 to 47.5 per cent last year

Baby boom: The number of babies born in Britain was the highest for 40 years but a record 47.5 had unmarried parents

If the trend continues at the same rate, most babies will have unmarried parents by 2016.

David Cameron has come under growing pressure to introduce tax breaks for married couples to send a signal that the institution is still valued.

Experts say children whose parents have tied the knot are happier and achieve more success later in life.

The Office for National Statistics said the proportion of babies born to unmarried mothers stood at 46.8 per cent in 2010, up from 40 per cent in 2000, 28.3 per cent in 1990 and 11.8 per cent in 1980.

‘This continues the long-term rise in the percentage of births outside marriage/civil partnership, which is consistent with increases in the number of couples cohabiting rather than married or in a civil partnership,’ the ONS said.

When records began in 1938, the year before the outbreak of Second World War, 95.8 per cent of babies had married parents.

The figures for 2012 also include births registered by a same-sex couple outside of a civil partnership.

Boom: The number of babies born each year has been gradually rising since the turn of the century, but is still much lower than the post-war baby boom

The change comes after the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 allowed two women in a same-sex couple to register a birth.

In 2012 there were 556 babies born to same-sex couples in a civil partnership and 252 births registered by gay couples outside a civil partnership.

Mr Cameron has promised gay and straight married couples will benefit from a tax break, worth around £150-a-year.

Tim Loughton, the former Children's minister, urged the government to introduce the allowance to halt the decline in marriage.

'If people are prepared to make a public declaration to each other in front of their friends and family they are more likely to stay together. Without marriage people drift in and out of relationships very easily,' he told the Telegraph.

'In families where parents break up children do less well at school, are more likely to suffer mental health problems and are more likely to have substance abuse problems.

'The government needs to send a very clear message that it supports marriage. That's why married tax breaks are so important.'

Over the last three-quarters of a century the number of babies born in England and Wales has fluctuated.

In 2012 there were 729,674 live births, up around 6,000 on the year before, continuing a rising trend seen since 2001 when there were only 594,634.

The lowest number of babies born on record was in 1977, when there were only 569,259 as the country was still emerging from the deep recession earlier in the decade.

The post-war years saw record numbers of babies born, hitting 881,026 in 1947 and the emergence of the generation known as the baby boomers.
