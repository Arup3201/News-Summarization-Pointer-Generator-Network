Jerry Wayne Hale, 30, was shot on Thursday after he tried to rob Keith Hall's home

Texas police shot an armed homeowner dead on Thursday, just seconds
after he killed a burglar who tried to break into his house.

According to the Dallas Morning News reports, burglar Jerry
Wayne Hale, 30, thought the 'reclusive' homeowner' was already dead. He allegedly came to
collect Keith Hall’s possessions.

Hall, 57, was equipped with a gun before Hale arrived just
before 7:45pm.

Witnesses heard gunfire and pleaded with Hall not to shoot
the intruder. They called 911.

‘I said, 'No, don’t kill him. I’ve already called the cops.
Cops are on the way,'said witness David Murphey to CBS0-DFW.

According to Murphey, the homeowner said, 'Good, I’m going
to kill him and then I’m going to shoot them, too.'

Hall shot the intruder, stood over him in an alleyway and told him he wanted to shoot him again.

The witnesses ran away, frightened.

The police arrived, but this was not enough to get Keith
Hall to cooperate. When police gave him, ‘loud verbal commands to drop the gun,’
he refused and raised his 9mm gun to point it at police officers. Three officers
opened fire and fatally shot 57-year-old Keith Hall.

Both Hale and Hall were pronounced dead. No officers were injured.

Maj. Jeff Cotner of the crimes against person's division reported on Friday that officers didn't realize Keith Hall was defending his home in the 10300 block of Sandra Lynne Drive.

However, according to Cotner, Hall was given plenty of opportunities to drop his weapon.

Hall tried to shoot at cops even after he'd been shot down to the floor.

'He’s down on the ground, he’s on his back. His weapon is
nearby,' Cotner said.

'The officers are yelling at him — he’s still alive. He
reaches for his weapon and begins to pick it up and point it again. They fire
again,' he continued.

Keith Hall had no criminal record, though he had filed for bankruptcy in 2005. He was described as a 'hoarder' who had been visited by city code enforcement officers about his poor upkeep at home.

“He was a loner,” said Hall's 88-year-old neighbor Robert Schreiber.

Schreiber said Hall had lived there for
more than 20 years. But he never knew anything about Schreiber other than he never cut his grass.

Hale on the other hand had been arrested 14 times since 2000 according to the Department of Public Safety records.

He was convicted of theft, unauthorized use of a vehicle, drug possesion charges, and criminal mischief.

Hale's girlfriend told police that he went to Hall's home to burglarize it.
