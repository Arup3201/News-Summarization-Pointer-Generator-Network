Two carers nicknamed 'the matrons from hell' were jailed today after they subjected disabled care home residents to a series of abuses.

Joanne Robinson, 47, and Ann Leach, 48, assaulted, starved and humiliated two defenceless residents for almost two years while scared colleagues said nothing at a home in Farnsworth, near Bolton.

One of their victims, a 44-year-old woman who couldn't speak and was virtually blind, was strapped to a wheelchair as 'punishment' and locked inside her bedroom as she sobbed and screamed.

The women would mock the victim, 
saying 'get her in the chair' and calling her an 'ugly b****'. On other 
occasions they threw a jug of cold water at her and sprayed air 
freshener in her face.

Robinson
and Leach refused to let the residents eat at their normal pace 
and would throw their dinner in the bin. At one point the abused woman 
weighed just seven-and-a-half stone.

One fellow care worker told how 
Robinson kicked the woman after she collapsed on the floor, shouting: 
'Get up you f****** b****.

Another
resident, a 39-year-old man with severe cerebral palsy who had suffered
a stroke, was hit on the back of the head forcing him forward as he 
watched TV. When asked why she hit him, Leach had said: 'He gets on my 
nerves.'

When a colleague 
did confront Leach, she said: 'You don't want to cross me,' while 
Robinson added: 'She knows some very bad people.'

Both women were eventually suspended in October 2010 after several carers came forward to testify against them.

Of
the three residents of the care home, two were men in wheelchairs. The other, the woman, suffered from a rare genetic disorder called Cri du Chat 
syndrome which leaves her virtually blind, incontinent and prone to 
self-harming.

Former colleague Linda Millington, who testified against the women, said she was 'frightened' to report what she had seen.

Another colleague, Donna Joyce, said: 'We don’t 
lock people up but they would take hold of her upper arms and quickly 
get her into the room and shut the door.

'There is no need to use 
that much force. The towels were on the door practically every day. You 
could hear her banging her head against the wall and hear her crying and
shouting out but mainly you could hear her banging her head against the
wall or her wardrobe or the back of the door.'

Miss Joyce said Leach also attempted to silence the 
man when he became distressed after a bath by wrapping a towel across 
his face then pulling it tight at the back of his head.

Leach, of 
Piggott Street, Farnworth and Robinson of Bolton Road, Kearsley denied 
any wronging. Leach claimed she was the victim of a “culture of 
bitchiness” and claimed one of her former work colleagues had made a 
lesbian pass at her.

She also tried to excuse her 
cruelty by saying she suffered from Pre-menstrual syndrome. Both have since been sacked

At Manchester Crown Court today Robinson was jailed
for 15 months and mother-of-three Leach was given 21 months.

Both were 
unanimously found guilty of several counts of ill-treatment of a person 
without capacity after a 16-day trial.

Passing sentence, 
Judge Robert Atherton, said: 'These residents were as vulnerable as 
new born babies and they depended on people caring for them.

You 
betrayed those who you were supposed to be looking after.'

After 
the case the 44-year-old disabled woman’s mother, 67, said: 'We have 
been going through this for 18 long months, waiting for the trial and it
has been absolutely horrendous.

'The council promised the earth when
she moved there but to put her in care was horrendous.

At the time my 
daughter was always so upset and whenever we visited she wanted to come 
with us.

'We thought it was because she wanted to come home. She lost three stone in three years and something was definitely wrong. I will always regret having put her there.'

Bolton
Council’s Director of Adult Services, John Rutherford, said: 'We will 
carry out a full internal review of the circumstances and detail 
relating to the specifics of this case to establish if any lessons can 
be learned.'
