You may be trying to get in shape and lose weight in order to find love... but you might need to let yourself go a little in order to keep it.

Overweight people are less likely to file for divorce than their more slender peers, according to a study.

Couples whose individual weights sit between 101 and 200lbs - considered 'physically fit' - are three times more likely to end their marriage than those of any other size, according to online separation service Mydivorcepapers.com.

Couples who are considered physically fit are the most likely to divorce, while those who are overweight tend to stay together more

The site found that out of 2,708 cases, 2,054 involved individuals in that weight bracket: almost 76 per cent.

People weighing between 201 and 250lbs accounted for 493 of the cases (18.21 per cent), and only 143 divorce cases involved people weighing over 250lb (just over five per cent).

The results seem to intimate that happy people eat more - evidence backed up by further recent research which found that 60 per cent of people put on weight when they are in a comfortable relationship.

Some
62 per cent of people admit gaining up to a stone since being in a 
relationship, while 72 per cent also think their partner has put on 
weight.

Part of this seems to be to do with mirroring your beloved's eating habits - 52 per cent of women say they often eat the same amount as 
their male partner, and 56 per cent admit this means they eat much 
larger portions than they would normally - but another reason seems to be a drop in physical activity.

Upon entering into a happy relationship, 30 per cent of couples say their main
activity together becomes staying in and watching television, while 20 per 
cent state eating out together as a key bonding pastime.

More than 60 per cent of people put on weight when they are in a comfortable relationship and 72 per cent also think their partner has put on weight since the start of their relationship

The research, commissioned by Diet Chef, also revealed that 66 per cent of couples think they have put on weight together.

This makes being in a relationship the most common cause of weight gain, beating comfort eating, lack of exercise, and holidays.

Izzy
Cameron, Nutrition and Weight Management Specialist at Diet Chef said: 
‘This survey has revealed some very interesting results, and it’s 
surprising to see how complacent people can be when they are in a 
relationship.

‘It’s 
widely known that people tend to put on a little bit of weight once they
have found love, but what we didn't expect to find was that the weight 
gain is on average a stone, if not more.
