Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has revealed that Frank Lampard's future will be resolved before the turn of the year.

Lampard is on loan from New York City until January but City have been negotiating all possible avenues to secure an extension for the 36-year-old midfielder, who has  six goals this season.

'I hope Frank's future will be resolved in the next days,' Pellegrini said, 'I said at the beginning that it will be in December when we will have the last decision. He is very important for our team so I hope that he will stay.

Asked whether it could cause issues in the club's relationship with New York, the City boss suggested a decision will be taken in the best interests of all parties.

'No, I don't think [that it will cause problems]. That's why we have a long conversation with all of them. They are just one club so I think what is better for the club is better for all the clubs.'

Pellegrini, whose City side are only three points behind Chelsea at the top of the Barclays Premier League, also hopes to have Vincent Kompany and Stevan Jovetic fit to play some part in the hectic Christmas period, although the Boxing Day trip to West Brom may prove too soon.

Home games against Burnley and Sunderland may prove more realistic for the pair, although Pellegrini will have to do without strike duo Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero until mid-January.

'I'm not the doctor but Jovetic and Kompany will be soon, at the end of this week or next week. Dzeko and Aguero will be the second part of January.'
