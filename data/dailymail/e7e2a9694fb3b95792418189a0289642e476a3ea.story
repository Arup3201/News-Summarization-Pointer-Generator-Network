It is a problem the average traveller doesn't often have to deal with.

 But if you want to fly into any of these 10 airports, you'll be paying much more than that in landing fees.

Website The Richest has compiled a list of the most expensive airports for landing fees, which are based on the 767-400 aircraft, which can hold up to 50 passengers but is often customised for private use. 

Surprisingly, the three most expensive airports for landing fees are in Japan.

By far the most expensive airport is Haneda Airport, also known as Tokyo International Airport, where planes are charged a whopping £4,559 ($6,850) just for the privilege of landing.

Welcoming almost 69million passengers a year, and still maintaining an incredibly high punctuality rating, it is perhaps understandable that fees can be high.

Tokyo's Narita International Airprot comes second, charging £3,728 ($5,600), while Kansai International Airport in Osaka charges £3,594 ($5,400) per landing. 

Number eight on the list of the most expensive airport landing fees is Dublin Airport at £2,729

Somewhat surprisingly, the UK's Bristol Airport makes it into the top 10 as the only British airport featured, charging £2,929 ($4,400) per private jet landing, just behind Toronto in Canada and Darwin, Australia.

The only US airport to make it into the top 10 is LaGuardia, in New York, which charges $3,950 (£2,630) for private jets arriving in the city.

Other unexpected appearances in the top 10 also include Dublin Airport, in eighth place and Salzburg, in Austria, in 10th.
