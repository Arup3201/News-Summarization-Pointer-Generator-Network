Egyptian President Abdul Fattah Al Sissi called for steps to bring 'wrongdoers' to justice and Othman was arrested on Monday night.

But Othman claimed he treated the orphans like his children and was only trying to stop them from misbehaving.

They apparently turned on the TV and opening the refrigerator without his permission. 

His wife reportedly gave other videos to prosecutors as evidence.   

Shortly after the video was uploaded, Social Solidarity Minister Ghada Wali ordered for the children to be transferred to another orphanage. 

An activist with the handle @GhadaEgyptologist tweeted: 'The kids are so happy, as if they just got freed from a prison'.

If convicted, the defendant can be jailed for seven years in prison, according to legal experts.
