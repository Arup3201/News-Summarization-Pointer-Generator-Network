A man obsessed with redheads and extreme porn lured a girl to his home and took pictures as he killed her.

Jamie Reynolds, 23, offered to take a portrait series of flame-haired Georgia Williams, a policeman’s daughter who wanted to be a model.

But after taking a few snaps he produced a ligature and throttled the 17-year-old. He continued taking pictures after the former head girl had died.

Details of the horrific case emerged 
yesterday when Reynolds pleaded guilty to murder on what was due to be 
the first day of his trial. The case is the latest in a series to 
involve extreme internet pornography.

Last
week, Ian Watkins, leader singer of the rock band Lostprophets, 
admitted sex attacks on two babies after becoming obsessed with online 
child pornography.

Yesterday, trial judge Mr Justice Wilkie was warned a ‘great deal of extreme pornography’ was relevant to Georgia’s murder.

Following
the killing in Wellington, Shropshire, in May, Reynolds drove 50 miles 
in his stepfather’s work van to remote woodland near Wrexham to dump his
victim’s body.

Investigation: Police forensic officers outside Reynolds' home around the time of Georgia's death

Numberplate
cameras recorded him travelling 200 miles further to Glasgow, where he 
abandoned the van in a car park. He was arrested three days later at a 
budget hotel.

Reynolds had a fascination with death and material found on his computers is thought to include ‘snuff movies’ of people dying.

Stafford
Crown Court heard he doctored with extreme material the images of 50 
young women he found on social networking sites. He had also written 
sick fantasies, including one about a colleague at the  Welcome Break 
M54 service station near  Telford who had spurned him.

Friends said Reynolds had declared his ‘undying love’ for Georgia and had been pestering her for dates before he killed her.

They said she considered ‘their relationship was nothing more than friendship’ that began at a youth music night at a pub.

Reynolds attended Ercall Wood Technology College in Telford, where Georgia, an RAF cadet, was head girl in her final GCSE year.

Hunt: Police were searching for this van as they looked for Reynolds following the discovery of Georgia's body

Police
believe she was murdered within 90 minutes of walking to the home 
Reynolds shared with his mother Kay – said by neighbours to be a teacher
– stepfather Shaun Thomas, an electrician, and sister Brogran, 19. 
Georgia’s family thought she came home later that night and realised she
was missing only when she failed to meet boyfriend Matthew Bird, 19, 
the next day.

Her 
parents, Detective Constable Steve Williams, 57, and Lynette, 52, sat 
with their elder daughter  Scarlett, 22, in court yesterday to see 
Reynolds plead guilty.

He is being held at Merseyside’s Ashworth mental hospital, alongside Moors Murderer Ian Brady.

Mr
Justice Wilkie said he was considering imposing a whole life term later
this month. Outside court, Georgia’s father said in a statement   that 
the family were still raw with pain and would ‘never make any sense of 
what happened’.

A former
colleague of Reynolds, who was an amateur photographer, said the killer
had hounded fellow workers with unwanted advances.

The woman, who asked not to be identified, said Reynolds crashed his car into that of another woman he targeted.

‘She
was getting a bit intimidated by the constant pestering, asking her 
out, telling people how much he liked her and trying to get her on her 
own,’ the colleague said.

‘She
finally stood up to him and I believe he stormed out of the petrol 
station and as he was driving off he reversed into her car and caused 
quite a lot of damage. He got the sack after that.’

Five years ago he was cautioned for harassing an ex-girlfriend.

Uniform: Georgia, 17, was a keen member of the Air Cadets and hoped to join the RAF

Popular: Georgia, who was head girl at her school, drew 800 mourners to a memorial service in June

The
Daily Mail has campaigned to clean up the internet through its Block 
Online Porn campaign. All 20million families in the UK who have an 
internet connection will now be given a choice whether to opt in or 
block online pornography from home networks.

The breakthrough – announced at a Downing Street summit on protecting  
children online last month – followed concern over high-profile cases 
such as that of Mark Bridger, who  murdered five-year-old April Jones in
Machynlleth, Mid-Wales, in  October 2012 after building up a library of
depraved images using internet searches.

The
same year, Stuart Hazell killed 12-year-old Tia Sharp – his 
girlfriend’s granddaughter – in Croydon, South London, after months of 
trawling internet pornography.
