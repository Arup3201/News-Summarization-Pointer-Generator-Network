Gus Dorman looks like an average 5-year-old, but with an IQ of 147, there is nothing average about one of the youngest members of the exclusive Mensa club.

Dorman, of Collinsville, Illinois, learned to read while singing Karaoke. The kindergartener also knows every element on the periodic table, every state in the US and every country in the world.

While his classmates at Renfro Elementary School are busy learning their ABCs, the 5-year-old prodigy reads entire books, like Charlotte's Web, and keeps himself informed about world events by reading newspapers in the bathroom.

Voracious reader: Even when the Dorman family go camping, they bring along plenty of books and magazines for Gus to read

The boy's father, Rob Dorman, told Stltoday.com that he and his wife, Kotomi, knew their son had some 'unique abilities' even when he was an infant.

'He started reading when he was 18-months-old,' Dorman said. 'He was sitting on the porta-potty reading a newspaper. I noticed that he liked to look at maps so I put one up. In about a week's time, he had memorized everything on it. He's just always been very clever.'

But the Dormans said that they had no idea Gus, who is their firstborn, was truly gifted until this past February, when a family friend was shocked to discover that then-4-year-old boy was able to read a slogan off someone's clothing.

The parents said that because they had never had a child before, they just assumed that all kids develop at Gus' breakneck pace.  

Last month, the Dormans  had their son tested for intelligence quotient (IQ), and the results confirmed their suspicions: the 5-year-old scored in the 99.98 percentile in seven of eight categories on the Standford-Bient Intelligence Scale.

On the knowledge test, he scored just above genius level, earning him a spot in the exclusive Mensa club where the qualifying IQ score is 135.

Mensa has 110,000 members in 100 countries, the youngest of whom is 3 years old. 

Born on October 27, 2007, little Gus was reading newspapers over his breakfast cereal before age 2. According to his parents, their son mastered letters, words and full sentences by singing karaoke at home, Mr Dorman told MailOnline.

These days, one of his favorite reading materials is Wired Magazine, which reports on technology. In fact, Gus’ father told MailOnline in a phone interview Thursday that his son is such a voracious reader that the family travels with a large supply of books and journals even when they go camping.

The toddler could count to 1,000 even before setting foot in kindergarten and was able to put together a 1,000-piece puzzle of the periodic table.

A doctor who examined the little boy told the Dormans that he is a very fortune child because most kids who display this kind of unique characteristics are usually ‘twice exceptional’:  intellectually gifted children who have some form of disability, such as autism.

Gus, however, does not fall on the autistic spectrum, according to Mr Dorman.

Even before he could walk, Gus was absorbing information like a sponge from an iTouch. Nowadays, he uses an educational app on an iPad to teach himself second-grade math, reading and writing.

Gus has an insatiable appetite for knowledge, and sometimes he even stumps his parents with his ceaseless questions. 

One day, the toddler was asking his father chemistry questions one after another until Mr Dorman finally ran out of answers.

Seeking to provide his son with the information he sought, Rob Dorman called Southern Illinois University and asked to speak to the chemistry department, which ended up sending a graduate student to the Dormans’ home for dinner.

But even the chemistry scholar was left confounded by some of Gus’ sophisticated questions.

In another instance reported by ABC News, Gus got into a heated argument with his dad, who told him that the capital of Alaska is Anchorage. The 5-year-old insisted that it is Juneau - and he was right.

Oddly enough, however, Gus has not been doing well in school. His father said the 5-year-old cannot sit through a lesson because he gets bored learning material that he already knows. As a result, he often gets in trouble for acting out.

'He thinks he's a bad kid but he just needs to be challenged,' Mr Dorman told Stltoday.com.

Rob Dorman and his son have been regularly attending school board meetings asking the Collinsville School District to address the needs of students with special abilities by providing them with an intellectually stimulating environment, such as a gifted program.

'If a kid was deaf or blind, the school district would do something about it,' Dorman said. 'But for a profoundly gifted student, there is nothing.'

however, Vicki Reulecke, the district's director of curriculum and assessment, said the district does not have enough money in the budget to provide specialized services for gifted students.

Still, Gus’ days are jam-packed with learning. He is being taught Japanese at home and also takes formal language classes every Saturday at Webster University.

Proof of brilliance: Rob Dorman submitted an application to a gifted program, which included some of Gus' math worksheets (left and right)

He also studies at the Kumon after-school learning program for children, takes piano lessons and goes to soccer practice.

But the Dormans are still hoping to find an educational setting for their wunderkind to meet his rapidly evolving intellectual needs. 

Last month, Mr Dorman submitted an application on Gus' behalf to the Davidson Gifted Young Scholars Program.   

While they await a response, Rob Dorman said he is happy to teach his son what he knows about the boy's two new passions: black holes and astrophysics.
