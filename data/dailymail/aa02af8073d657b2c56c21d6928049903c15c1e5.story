A police officer who saved a 2-month-old baby from choking to death 20 years ago, will attend her wedding this Sunday in Chicago.

Shammarah Hamideh's family has remained in contact with Sgt Joseph Barca, eternally grateful for the cop's quick actions in their daughter's time of need.

'Her father over the years has always referred to me as her American dad. The family is Palestinian,' Barca told 1010 WINS. 'He said he gave her life the first time, and I gave her life the second time.'

Shammarah was just two months old when her father called police on December 28, 1993, after she went limp and stopped breathing.

Barca was the first to respond to the call of a baby not breathing on Linden Street in Yonkers, New York.

Outside the Hamideh's apartment building, he found Shammarah's father Mahmoud crying and holding his lifeless daughter in his arms.

Barca attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but knew air wasn't reaching her lungs.

So he flipped the baby over and hit her over the back sharply three or four times and a wad of mucous flew out of her mouth.

Barca then continued resuscitation until the ambulance arrived, and by the time Shammarah reached the hospital she was breathing on her own again. 

He says he'll never forget the moment he greeted the girl's father at the emergency room.

'The father showed up expecting to hear the worst,' Barca told the Journal News. 'I said, "You hear that baby crying? That's yours." Then he started crying.'

That
 life-saving moment has bonded Barca to the Hamideh ever since, and he 
calls Shammarah, now 20, the daughter he never had. Barca and his wife 
Helen have three adult children, a school teacher and two police 
officers.

'He's
 so sweet,' Shammarah said of Barca. 'He's very considerate — every year
 on my birthday, he sends me a birthday card and check. They treat me 
like I'm their daughter.'

Since
 Barca saved her life, Shammarah has gone on to earn a nursing degree in
 Buffalo, New York and plans to find a job in the field in Chicago, 
where she plans to move with her new husband.

Shammarah will wed truck-driver Mohammed Salah in a ceremony on Sunday, attended by Barca and his wife.

Meanwhile, Barca plans to retire from the force this fall.
