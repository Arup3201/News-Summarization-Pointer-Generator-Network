Alan Irvine insisted that he can still turn things around at West Brom and save his job despite suffering a seventh defeat in nine league games at Stoke.

Two goals from Senegal striker Mame Biram Diouf gave Stoke a 2-0 win and Irvine had to endure a barrage of abuse as he walked past his own supporters and down the tunnel at the final whistle.

Asked if he is still the man to guide the club through their current slump, Irvine said: ‘I believe that I am. I think the players believe we all are as well, but obviously other people will make decisions as far as that’s concerned. I’m not in control of that.

‘I want to carry on, I want to still do this job and see it turning around. That’s not going to change. We’re all in this together.

‘It’s not really about me, I’m more concerned about the players and the team. I’ve got to get on with it, there’s no other choice is there? It’s one of those situations where I try to make changes to see if I can changes things. Sometimes they work sometimes they don’t.’

On the abuse he suffered at the end, the Scot added: ‘I can understand. People are frustrated, I’m frustrated, and so are the players. I can understand them expressing that, it’s the nature of the job.

‘If anyone is going to take it then I’m the person. I’m there to be shot at. I stand out there and take it. I’m prepared to take the criticism. I don’t know if they would have wanted me to acknowledge them (at the end). What do you do in those circumstances?
