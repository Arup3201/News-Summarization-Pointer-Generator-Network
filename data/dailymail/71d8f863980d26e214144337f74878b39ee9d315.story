Critic: Griff Rhys Jones attacked plans to install one of the UK's largest solar farms in the Suffolk countryside

He has spent the past few years championing the great British countryside.

So when developers announced plans for an enormous solar power farm near the home of Griff Rhys Jones, they should have expected a fight.

The 59-year-old comedian yesterday attacked proposals for a £20million renewable energy plant in the area of Suffolk where he lives with his family.

Calling the plans ‘cavalier’ and ‘willy-nilly’, he said they would ruin the unspoilt rural area for generations to come.

He is the latest personality to speak out over so-called ‘green’ initiatives to build solar and wind farms in rural beauty spots.

‘This sort of planning cannot be done in this ad hoc way,’ he said. ‘They need a much more considered approach.

'This is an area of outstanding natural beauty. We cannot license an industrial plant to be built willy-nilly on any farm.

‘To be this cavalier with this sort of development is foolish. We will be despoiling the countryside for limited results.

‘If areas as beautiful as this can be built over so quickly, this is something we will live to regret.’

Rhys Jones made his name in 1980s satirical comedy Not The Nine O’Clock News, but is now better known for his love of rural  Britain, most recently with last year’s documentary series Britain’s Lost Routes.

His series Three Men In A Boat highlighted the treasures of the Thames.He lives next to the picturesque Stour river at Holbrook, around two miles from the site of the proposed solar power farm.

The solar panels, which would provide power for up to 5,400 homes, would occupy 94 acres of farmland beside the Alton Water reservoir beauty spot at Tattingstone near Ipswich.

The developers said they chose the site because it was not near to houses – but locals have pointed out that it would be visible from popular rambling routes.

Rhys Jones said he is not against 
renewable energy in principle, but believed such developments should not
be approved at the cost of ruining areas of natural beauty.

Protesting plans: The new £20m plant, which will prevent up to 7,740 tons of CO2 emissions annually, is to be build near Griff Rhys Jones' home in Holbrook, Suffolk

He added: ‘Filling an area the size of 50 football pitches – which is open to view on three sides from public rights of way – with 72,000 three-metre high plastic panels simply cannot be a sensible way to use our best-quality agricultural land in a highly attractive landscape.

‘The area is heavily used for leisure and recreation and very close to Alton Water. There are brownfield sites five miles away that would be better suited.

‘I am totally opposed to it. I hope the council sees sense and opposes it.’

Last year he criticised the ‘hypocrisy’ of wind farms, calling them ‘green tokenism’.

Babergh District Council is due to consider the plans for the solar farm, which will prevent up to 7,740 tons of CO2 emissions annually, today. The area is designated by the council as a special landscape area and officers are recommending that a decision should not be made until June 12.

Tim Purbrick, commercial director of green energy firm Hive Energy which wants to build the farm, said: ‘I am surprised Griff Rhys Jones does not support the plans.

‘If he wants people to buy his DVDs, they will need electricity to play them and we have a problem in this country with many power stations about to reach the end of their lives. We now have an opportunity for renewable energy in this country.’

He said the site was ‘particularly suitable’, adding: ‘The field would be fully screened from the residents’ visibility and a significant amount of electricity would be supplied to them.’
