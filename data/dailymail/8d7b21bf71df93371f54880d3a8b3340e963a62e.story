UFO hunters believe that may have found evidence of a UFO streaking through the sky - on Mars.

They claim a picture taken by the Curiosity rover shows a possible extra terrestrial craft.

In the image, a bright object can been seen appearing to leave a trail in the Martian sky.

UFO spotters claim the object in the top right of the sky could be a UFO - saying the conical shape exhibits all the hallmarks of an extra terrestrial craft

The video, posted by prolific UFO hunter Streetcap1 uses an image stored on Nasa's servers.

'Enlargement of the object reveals a spherical top cone, a rounded center mass and what looks like some kind of propellant ejecting from its tail,' the Bublews site claims.

'Does Mars have its own space programme?'

According to the ufosightingsdaily site, 'Another UFO was caught in a Mars rover photo.

'If you look at it closely, you see that it has a trail behind it and it looks to be moving to the upper right side of the photo.'

The image is one of several UFO hunters have claimed show mysterious objects in the sky.

However on further inspection many turn out to be meteors in the sky.

One Youtube commenter points this out, saying 'I'm sure they will have a meteor excuse but the trail says otherwise.'

The finding is not Curiosity's first brush with extraterrestrial life - according to some experts.

This iguana-shaped rock is seen on the top right of this image. It would be easy to miss, but the keen eye of Scott C. Warin, was able to spot the iguana rock in several photos taken by the Mars Curiosity rover

In May, a science blogger claimed to have spotted a lizard meandering around Mars.

The unknown spotter from Japan alerted Mr Warin of the unusual sight.

The claim, posted on UFO Sightings Daily, caused some excitable conspiracy theorists to fear that Nasa could be planting life on the planet for scientific testing.

â€˜Then again, is Nasa placing animals from tiny cyogenic chambers inside the rover onto the surface of Mars to conduct tests?' he continued.

Curiosity landed on Mars on August 6, 2012, and has spent its time investigating and analysing the landscape and geology of the red planet.

The $2.5 billion rover was sent to the planet to assess if the planet most like Earth has or ever had the chemical ingredients and environments for microbial life.

The image was taken by Nasa's Mars Science Laboratory nicknamed Curiosity, which left Earth on Nov 26 on its mission to explore the red planet.
