A German farmer has discovered metal and human bones in a field - raising suspicions they may be the remains of a British tank and its crew which fell prey to the Nazis less than a week before VE Day.

Martin Bergbauer, 55, said his tractor struck a hard object as he cut the grass in the field. On kneeling down to inspect the damage he realised he had hit a large chunk of metal.

Aware of rumours that a British tank had been destroyed in the area near his field in Kutenholz - a municipality near the German city of Stade in Lower Saxony - during the final few days of the Second World War, Mr Bergbauser called in the police who subsequently found human remains.

Remains: It is thought the chunk of metal may be the track cover from a Cromwell tank belonging to the British Army's 7th Armoured Division. If that's the case, the occupants are likely to have died just days before VE Day

Discovery: Officers arriving at the site called in bomb disposal experts who managed to uncover the armoured side of a tank and also parts of a human skeleton, including the thigh bone

Police spokesman Rainer 
Bohmbach said digging stopped as soon as the bomb disposal
 units were able to determine there was unlikely to be anything dangerous close to 
the surface.

The human remains have now been sent away for analysis, and the site temporarily sealed off.

British forces did not reach the area where the tank was found until the very final stages of the Second World War, so if the debris does turn out to be the remains of a British tank, it is likely to have been destroyed within a week of VE day.

Although it cannot be determined how the tank was destroyed from the handful of photographs that have been released, it almost certainly hit a landmine or came up against a basic anti-tank gun, as the last remnants of the Nazi army in the area had little or no access to tanks themselves.

John Delaney, collections manager at the Imperial War Museum, said the evidence provided and the size and shape of the chunk of metal discovered, suggests the debris is likely to have come from a Cromwell tank belonging to the 7th Armoured Division.

Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'The 
unusual thing about those units in the British army is that they weren't
 by-and-large equipped with the Sherman tank, they were equipped almost 
exclusively with the Cromwell tank.'

'That's the right size for the bit of wreckage that has been recovered, and also it's the right shape.'

'What you're looking at there is the cover that goes over the top of the track. And then it bolts on to the side of tank using brackets - which are the small ridges you can see in the image'.

'Because the cover is long and rectangular, it's not a Sherman. Which means it's probably a Cromwell, which fits with it possibly being 7th Armoured Division, whose units we believe were operating in the area at the time'.

If the remains are confirmed as belonging to British soldiers, they are likely to be buried at the closest Commonwealth War Graves cemetery that has space. That is understood to be at Reichswald (pictured)

Stuart Wheeler, librarian at the Tank Museum, confirmed that the 7th Armoured Division would have been in the right area at the time, adding the regiment is likely to have been following veteran reconnaissance units from the 2nd Derbyshire Yeoman and the 51st Highland Division.

If this is the case, the argument that the suspected Cromwell was destroyed by a landmine or a heavily concealed anti-tank weapon - as opposed to a German tank regiment - is strengthened.

The 7th Armoured Division is thought to have in excess of 100 Cromwell tanks in its possession at the time, but unfortunately there is no central database detailing when and where British tanks were lost during the Second World War.

If the remains are confirmed as belonging to British soldiers, the next step would be for the German authorities to contact the British embassy, who would then attempt to identify the victims.

Speaking to MailOnline, Peter Francis of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission said his organisation would then get involved to make sure the remains were being handled with respect.

They would insist the remains are handed over to with care, and are then likely to be buried at the closest Commonwealth War Graves cemetery where there is space.

This is likely to be either the site at Reichswald, near the Rhine, or in Berlin.

'This process is done with the utmost respect for the remains. These people gave their lives for their country, and that should not be forgotten,' he said.
