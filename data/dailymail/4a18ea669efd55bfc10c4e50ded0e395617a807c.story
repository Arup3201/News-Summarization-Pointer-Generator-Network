A teenager jailed for at least 24 years for shooting dead one of three friends walking to an Adelaide New Year's Eve party has challenged his murder conviction claiming he was too drunk to specifically intend to harm anyone.

A lawyer for Liam Humbles, 19, asked the Court of Criminal Appeal on Wednesday to overturn her client's murder conviction saying it was based on error.

Humbles was found guilty in March of murdering Lewis McPherson, 18, and the attempted murder of Lewis' friends Liam Trewartha and James Lamont.

Liam Humbles, 19, was jailed for at least 24 years for shooting dead one of three friends walking to an Adelaide New Year's Eve party in 2012

The trio were walking to the party in Warradale, south west of Adelaide, on December 31, 2012, when they came across Humbles, an acquaintance, who fired shots at them while affected by drugs and alcohol.

Humbles' lawyer, Marie Shaw QC, said the judge overlooking his trial made an error in concluding that the 'grossly intoxicated' teen had the specific intent to murder.

'There is a difference between basic intent - to fire the gun, to do various acts - and specific intent (to kill),' Ms Shaw told the court.

She said Humbles was found to have a blood alcohol reading of between 0.252 and 0.284.

He had been drinking all day and was described as being in a 'comatose-type state' when he passed out on a bedroom floor, before being woken up by a friend who wanted Humbles' pistol.

After they argued, Humbles was ejected from the house and soon after those inside heard the shots being fired.

Ms Shaw said Humbles had exhibited 'bizarre behaviour' and when police came to the scene, he could not stand up, lost his balance when sitting down and fell asleep on the way to the police station.

His condition would have been heightened by his young age and the emotional state he was in after being ejected.

Ms Shaw also contended that the 24-year minimum term was 'manifestly excessive'.

The hearing continues.
