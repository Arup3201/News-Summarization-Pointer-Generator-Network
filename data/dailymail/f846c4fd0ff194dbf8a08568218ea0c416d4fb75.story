Naomi Watts is the latest to team up with Tommy Hilfiger to help women living with breast cancer.

The Australian star has signed on as global ambassador for the U.S. brand's limited-edition handbag for Breast Health International, which aids the charity's Fund For Living.

The 45-year-old actress joins current ambassadors Renée Zellweger, Carla Bruni, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer and a host of other famous philanthropic women.

The bag Ms Watts models in the ad costs $299, with $100 of every purchase going to the Fund for Living program.

Shot in her Los Angeles home by famed photographer Patrick Demarchelier, the campaign features the stunning blonde carrying the blue pebbled-leather accessory, complete with a signature red, white and blue keyring..

She wears a blue knit sweater as she stands by a window overlooking her lush backyard. 

Ms Watts told WWD: 'The Fund for Living takes care of people and their very specific needs.

'Those people that need extra help - like taking care of their children, getting to the doctors, the little details. Can you imagine having to deal with that level of crisis and then trying to maintain a life if you've got children? This just helps with managing things, having that extra support.'

In addition to the wonderful cause, the Academy Award nominee added that she is also a huge fan of the multi-functional bag, which is useful in transitioning from day to evening.

Ms Watts explained: 'It's a really functional bag. You can use it for work, and you can use it for going out. I hate having to change my bag.'

The bag will be available from the brand's website from September 25 and from certain Tommy Hilfiger stores globally for October 1.
