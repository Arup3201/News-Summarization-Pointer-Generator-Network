Louis van Gaal took charge of his first competitive Manchester United match on Saturday, and saw his side beaten 2-1 at home by Swansea, as his reign got off to the worst possible start.

The Dutchman steered Holland to third place at this summer's World Cup, before taking over as  United boss in July.

He had been tasked with turning the club's fortunes around after a disastrous campaign last season, but his reign got off to the worst possible start.
