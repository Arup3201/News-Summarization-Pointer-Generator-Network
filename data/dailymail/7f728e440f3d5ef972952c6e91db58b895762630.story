Thousands of JLS fans were lashed by torrential rain for two hours because of a health and safety ban on umbrellas at an open air concert.

An audience of nearly 7,000 went home drenched to the skin after being told off by an on-stage presenter for opening brollies at the rain-sodden amphitheatre in Scarborough, North Yorkshire.

The teenagers sat shivering while heavy-handed security staff ensured no one breached the brolly ban throughout the show at the Open Air Theatre on Saturday night.

I'm with the band: JB Gill, Marvin Humes, Oritse Williams and Aston Merrygold of JLS were covered by a roof - while those watching them were drenched

While the band were covered by a section of roof, the crowd - who had paid £33 per ticket to see their idols - were forced to suffer.

A local councillor said the ban at the venue had been standard from its opening, because large umbrellas 'could poke out someone's eye'.

But concert-goers were less impressed, with one teenager claiming her tonsils were so inflamed by the morning that she could neither speak nor swallow and needed emergency antibiotics.

Ice cream parlour worker Paige Taylor, 17, from Barrowcliff, Scarborough, now faces at least a week off work.

She said: 'By 8.30 it was absolutely pouring down. A lot of people were putting up their brollies and the security guards were telling everyone to put them down.

'Everyone was shocked and some people started refusing because it was torrential rain.

'Then a presenter came on stage and said, everyone needs to put their brollies down because it’s a health and safety hazard.

'He said "No one wants their eye poked out". JLS were under a canopy but we had no shelter at all.

'I could have walked out but I am a big JLS fan and had been looking forward to the concert for weeks.'

Her furious mother Lesley, 47, added: 'It’s absolutely disgusting. She came home drenched with all her make-up running down her face.

'You are allowed umbrellas at Wimbledon and football matches which also have seated areas so why not here?

'She was wet through and freezing and was laid up all night awake with painkillers.

'It was a disappointing end to what should have been a great experience.

'The concert should have been cancelled when it started pouring down and everyone given their money back.'

Scarborough Council and tourism bosses from Welcome to Yorkshire hosted the event at Europe’s largest open air theatre.

Councillor David Jeffels, of Scarborough Council and Welcome to Yorkshire, said the theatre’s umbrella ban had 'been a standard rule from the word go'.

He added: 'If you put up one of those big golfing umbrellas you could really clobber someone - or poke them in the face or eye.

'It is generally accepted that you can’t put umbrellas up. You can sit around on a bank at a stately home with umbrellas but not in an auditorium setting.

Sunnier times: The open air theatre has no sliding roof protection for visitors - 'because it would have been too expensive'

'It is just one of those hazards. It was unfortunate it was such a poor night. I just hope that the majority of people were adequately dressed.'

The theatre, closed since 1986, reopened in 2010 following a £3.5million revamp, paid for by the profits made by redeveloping council-owned land on the seafront.

'If the theatre was covered it would make it a more attractive venue. We did consider putting a sliding roof on.

'But it would have added £1.5m to the cost and the council had already spent a lot of money restoring the theatre.

'I don’t think it is possible to cancel these things when they are being held under contract. They go ahead come what may.'

However, Scarborough Council had already put the concert back a week.

JLS’s management said they had had to juggle with the tour dates to give the boy band more time in the recording studio.

John O’Connell, research director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'It’s ridiculous that so much was spent making this venue water-tight, and now the slightest shower has ruined this event.

'Taxpayers will wonder where their hard-earned cash has gone, given that the Council has to make necessary savings.

'Local authorities have to reassess their priorities and reduce spending, and spending like this can be cut out and re-focused on frontline services.'
