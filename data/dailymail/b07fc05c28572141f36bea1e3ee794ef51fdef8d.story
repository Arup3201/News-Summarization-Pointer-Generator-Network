The horoscope of our future monarch contains a rare and auspicious alignment. It also poses two of the greatest cosmic challenges any astrologer could find in the chart of a newborn.

This is a royal who will grow up in a time of turmoil and will eventually preside over an era of marvels.

He will be a leader whose name will be remembered for the rest of time as the rule-breaker who became a peacemaker.

Children born in the few hours just before the Moon becomes precisely full — as it did at 7.16pm last night — tend to grow up troubled, but talented.

They tend to feel tension and estrangement more closely than most and though they often grow into exceptional people, it is usually because they have had to deal with so many issues at an early age.

This is the chart of a childhood that cannot be entirely easy. Unlikely though it may seem to us, given what we know (or think we know) of the Royal Family, there’s a suggestion of pressures close to home that will make great demands on this young man.

Yet for all this drama and trauma, William and Kate’s son will find an inner reserve of strength that shapes his character and moulds him into a truly charismatic monarch.

His story will be full of hard-won victories and narrow escapes — and these themes will run through the story of his subjects.

I base this prediction on far more than just the fact the new arrival is a sensitive Cancerian, just like his father and his grandmother Diana.

Though the sign of Leo began just a couple of minutes after he drew his first breath, he is a Cancerian through and through, even though he was born so close to the end of this sign and his father was born at the beginning of it. The newborn Prince has the Moon in Capricorn and Scorpio rising.

These are tricky influences — Moon in Capricorn people can be harshly self-critical and those with Scorpio rising can guard their privacy jealously — and there are other fascinating factors in his chart.

Just a few hours before his birth, Venus moved from Leo to Virgo, suggesting that babies born this week will be blessed with clever, inquiring minds.

And all this happened just as Mercury ended a particularly difficult retrograde phase. Children born when Mercury is retrograde tend to be thinkers rather than doers.

So it is almost as if the royal baby waited until he was a week overdue in order to pick up every possible astrological advantage to counteract the two most powerful potential downsides of his birth chart.

Children born so close to the monthly lunar culmination invariably lead charmed yet challenging lives.

Furthermore, a sharp opposition between Mars and Pluto is close enough to be exerting an influence and that’s an omen of lifelong strife and struggle.

Yet as readers of my column will know, this is a special week for another reason.

A phenomenon known as a Watery Grand Trine is being formed in the sky between Neptune in Pisces, Saturn in Scorpio plus the conjunction of Jupiter and Mars in Cancer.

Many experts are calling this a harmonic convergence and seeing it as a once-in-a- lifetime opportunity to heal the world, promote a culture of greater spirituality and increase an awareness of the need for world peace.

This child inherits the spirit of this convergence, carries it for his lifetime and, despite trials and tribulations, will become a deeply influential force for good.
