US women's soccer star goalkeeper Hope Solo was arrested at a suburban Seattle home on suspicion of assaulting her sister and 17-year-old nephew, but her attorney insisted that Solo herself was a victim in the altercation.

'Hope is not guilty of any crime,' attorney Todd Maybrown said in an email sent on Saturday. 'In fact, our investigation reveals that Hope was assaulted and injured during this unfortunate incident. We look forward to the opportunity to present the true facts in court and to having this matter behind Hope very soon.'

Officers responded to her sister's home just before 1 a.m. Saturday after receiving a 911 call that a woman at the Kirkland residence was hitting people and that she refused to stop or leave, the Kirkland Police Department said in a news release.

Arrested: U.S. Olympic gold medalist soccer player Hope Solo was taken into custody early Saturday morning after reportedly got into a scuffle with her sister and nephew at her home in Seattle

Scene: Officers arrived at the home in the 10600 block of 124th AVE NE after a 911 caller stated a woman at the residence was 'hitting people' and that she refused to stop or leave

They found Solo intoxicated and upset, saw injuries on her nephew and her sister, and arrested her after speaking with those present and determining that she was the primary aggressor, the release said.

She was booked into jail for investigation of two counts of fourth-degree domestic violence assault, and she was expected to remain in custody until an appearance Monday at Kirkland Municipal Court.

A telephone number listed for her was not accepting incoming calls Saturday, and the voice mail for a listing at the sister's home was full.

The sister was not identified by police, but in her memoir, Solo writes that she has a half sister named Terry.

Solo, 32, has won two Olympic gold medals for the US women's national team. She also plays with the Seattle Reign of the National Women's Soccer League.

This isn't the first altercation Solo has had with police. Reports show police were called to a disturbance at her Kirkland home in the early hours on Nov. 12, 2012, with her then-boyfriend Jerramy Stevens (pictured with Solo in 2013) arrested pending domestic violence charges. Stevens was released and the couple were married the following day

'We are aware of the situation with Hope and are now gathering information,' the Reign posted on the team's Twitter feed.

In 2012, she married former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens.

He was arrested just before their wedding for investigation of assault after a disturbance involving her, but he was not charged. Maybrown represented Stevens in that case.

Solo said soon afterward that there never was an assault and that she and her new husband were happy.

'It's unfortunate what the media can do to judge before the facts are out there. It's hard to see, but it's a hard truth, and it's part of life,' she said then. 'I'm happy. I'm happily married. I would never stand for domestic violence. I've never been hit in my life.'

In her last appearance for the US, Solo recorded her 71st career shutout, a 1-0 victory over France on June 14 in Tampa, Florida. She sat out the team's game against France on Thursday night in Connecticut. 

On Saturday, police were called the to the Kirkland home the Seattle Reign FC goalkeeper shares with her husband, former NFL player Jerramy Stevans, about 1:00am.

According to a police report obtained by The Seattle Times, a male caller told 911 the 32-year-old was 'hitting people' at a family gathering.

'Officer arrived and immediately heard the sounds of the disturbance inside the residence,' the report noted.

'They entered and contacted several persons; one being Hope A Stevens (Solo) who appeared intoxicated and upset.'

Authorities said Solo's 17-year-old nephew and her sister had visible injuries.

'After receiving statements of the persons involved, Officers determined that Solo was the primary aggressor and had instigated the assault,' the report said.

Kirkland police Lt. Mike Murray said there was 'a big party going on at her house'.

'It was an out-of-control situation' Lt. Murray told The Times.

The world-famous goalie has spoken before about her fractious family, writing in her 2012 biography they 'don't do happy endings'

Solo was processed at the SCORE misdemeanor jail in South King County on on Saturday morning on two counts of investigation of domestic violence assault.

Solo's late father, Jeffrey Solo, had two children, Terry and David, before divorcing his wife.

He then remarried and had Hope and her brother, Marcus.

In her 2012 biography, Solo: A Memoir Of Hope, she wrote of her tumultuous family relationships.

'My family doesn't do happy endings,' Solo said in the book.

'We do sad endings or frustrating endings or no endings at all.

'We are hardwired to expect the next interruption or disappearance or broken promise.'

Solo's father was also arrested for kidnapping her and her brother when she was seven.

Her parents had divorced the year prior.

She has previously spoken about how her dad picked her and her brother from their home in Richland, Washington - where they lived with her mother, Judy - to go to a baseball game in a nearby town.

However Jeffrey Solo continued to drive to Seattle, where the three stayed in a hotel for several days.

Hope and her brother believed it was a vacation, until their father was arrested at a bank.

In her professional life, Solo has played on two gold-medal winning Olympic women’s teams and appeared Dancing With The Stars.

According to The New York Post, the Seattle Reign is scheduled to play on Sunday against the Western New York Flash in Rochester.

'We are aware of the situation,' US Soccer said in a statement to the paper.

'At this point, we don’t have any further comments.'
