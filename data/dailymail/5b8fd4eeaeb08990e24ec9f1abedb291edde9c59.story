Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo will each have an Anfield jinx to overcome when they return there for a Champions League tie on Wednesday night.

Bale failed to win a game at Anfield in five attempts for Tottenham before his world-record £86million move to the Spanish capital.

And while Ronaldo did taste success at Anfield with Manchester United, he has never scored a goal there in five visits – unusual by his prolific standards.

Liverpool’s vice-captain Jordan Henderson can’t wait to face the current Champions League holders on what is likely to be a tremendous European night at Anfield.

‘I was pleased when the draw was made because you want to be playing against best teams. Real Madrid were the best team in Europe and have the best players too. Facing the likes of Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo can only make you improve and help your own game.

‘It is a big game for us and a big test. But we’ll go into it and play without any fear.’

Two years ago, the prospect of Henderson feeling confident about taking on the world’s best would have been laughable.

But the 24-year-old’s progress under Brendan Rodgers has been astonishing and he is now an automatic pick for both Liverpool and England.

His famed stamina and athleticism has led Rodgers to declare he is the only player in the country who can dominate games without the ball. The club are currently trying to extend his current contract, which has 18 months left.

‘To be honest, I’ve always had that ability to move well about the pitch. It’s the way I’ve played since I was very little - with passion. I love playing football and give everything I’ve got every time I play,’ he said.

‘Being made Steven Gerrard’s vice-captain at Liverpool is a huge honour for me personally and shows how far I’ve come in a couple of years. I’m really enjoying that role and grateful for the manager to give me that level of responsibility.

‘I tend not to listen too much to any praise I’m getting too much because you don’t want to get carried away. I just have to focus on football and learn from people around me. That’s all I can do.’

While Madrid’s front-four of Bale, Ronaldo, James Rodriguez and Karim Benzema are known throughout the world, Liverpool will be disappointed their main striker Daniel Sturridge misses on the big stage again following calf and thigh injuries.

‘Daniel is a massive player for club and country, a fantastic talent,’ acknowledged Henderson.

‘I played in my first Champions League game against Ludogorets this season and now we’ve got a really big European night ahead.

‘Anfield is always a brilliant stadium and the fans are fantastic. Last season it went up another level. Hopefully they can continue that and in sure they will be even more brilliant against Real Madrid.’

There are seven survivors from the last time Liverpool’s met Real Madrid in the 2009 Champions League – Iker Casillas, Marcelo, Pepe and Sergio Ramos for the Spaniards, and Martin Skrtel, Lucas and Steven Gerrard for Liverpool.
