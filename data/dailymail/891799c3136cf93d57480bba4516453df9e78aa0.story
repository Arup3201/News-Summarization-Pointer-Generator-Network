A 25 stone woman on benefits this week revealed that she would love to lose weight but she simply can't afford it.

Christina Briggs, 26, from Wigan, shared her story in Closer magazine and then on This Morning.

The mother-of-two said she hates being a dress size 26 but she can't afford to eat healthily or join a gym. She said she needs more money from the government in order to improve her health.

But is she right? Is it impossible to eat well and keep fit with limited funds?

Wants to lose weight: 25st Christina Briggs appeared on yesterday's This Morning and said she can't afford to eat heathily

Appeal: The mother-of-two said she needs more help from the government to change her lifestyle

Not at all say a number of leading dietitians and fitness trainers. 

Personal trainer Julia Buckley, author of the Fat Burn Revolution, told MailOnline: 'Getting fit doesn't have to cost you a penny and eating healthily can certainly be cheaper than takeaways and fast food.

'You don't need to have access to a health club or to pay a trainer to start exercising. Even as a trainer myself, I often don't use any kit at all in my own workouts. In fact, for beginners or people who have a lot weight to lose, a few basic equipment-free moves might be the best way to get started.

'Most people have a pair of trainers they can put on and go out for a walk, jog or run (depending on their fitness level). If you have internet access you have no excuse at all because YouTube is full of free videos where professional trainers demonstrate exercises.'

She added: 'If you have a bit more to spend, gym membership is now cheaper than ever before with some clubs charging less than £15 per month. Even getting professional coaching is now more affordable than ever with the help of the internet - I offer online fitness programmes from just £10 per week (so less than the price of a takeaway) with full support from me personally.

Go for a run: It costs nothing to take a jog around your local park

'In my book The Fat Burn Revolution, I outline a full 12-week programme of exercises which has got thousands of people into fantastic shape by training at home, with just a few basic pieces of equipment.'

As Julia pointed out, keeping fit doesn't have to be expensive as anyone can go out for a brisk walk or run. While kit from some sports brands can be costly, supermarkets now stock fitness clothing at much more affordable prices.

Budget chain Aldi regularly include sports kit in their 'special buys' (the latest range will be on sale in stores from 9th October) with trainers for £14.99, running socks for £2.99 and a long sleeve shirt for £9.99.

Meanwhile parkrun offer free 5k runs to people every Saturday morning across the UK. The runs are open to all ages and abilities and you don't have to pay to take part. You just turn up and walk or run round the course. 

Julia added that when it comes to healthy eating, you don't have to spend a lot either. 

Healthy eating: Rice and stir-fried vegetables is a cheap and easy to make meal that's low in fat

She said: 'It has been shown time and again that you can eat healthily on a limited budget. If you can afford to buy takeaways you can certainly afford to eat healthily, it's more about where you're choosing to spend your income and the choices you're making. 

'Think about it, for about 30p you can buy an apple, or an egg, or a courgette. Plus healthy foods give you more energy and make you feel fuller for longer, so you don't end up constantly reaching for more the way you do when eating junk food.'

She added: 'The real issue for a lot of people is that they don't know how to make healthy food taste good, but again, there's a wealth of free resources on the internet with information how to cook tasty healthy meals.'

Home work out: Sits up and press ups can be done without joining a gym

One of the people who shares her passion for healthy eating online is dietitian Nichola Whitehead. She shares a number of recipes for tasty, low fat meals and snacks on her website www.nicsnutrition.com.

She told MailOnline: 'Eating less meat and more vegetarian protein can actually save you money, e.g. beans, lentils or pulses, and canned or frozen fruits and vegetables are often cheaper and just as nutritious as their fresh alternatives. 

'High fat takeaways often cost more than a home-prepared healthy meal e.g. beans on toast with mushrooms. Buying fatty and sugary snacks means paying for 'empty calories' (calories with no nutrients) which can contribute to weight gain if eaten in excess!' 

Julia urges people like Christina to take some responsibility for their own health for their own good.

She said: 'It's such a shame that people don't put more value on their own health, we all know the obesity crisis is putting a huge strain on the economy, there's nothing cheap about that!

Budget buy: These Aldi running shoes cost £14.99

'The benefits of being fit and healthy are priceless, I know it can be hard to get started, but please don't use money as an excuse, it's a question of priorities, if you can afford takeaways, you can afford to be fit and healthy if you really want to be.'

This is something Gareth Clement, 25, from Swansea learnt. He used to be obese but lost 7st after he started eating healthily and exercising. Now he helps over people follow his example through his business, Diet Right.

He told MailOnline: 'Budget dieting can be easy with the right tools and great support, it can also be cost effective, saving you, not only money, but your life. Christina can lose weight. She is just stuck in a cycle and a habit that needs breaking.'

He added: 'Eating healthy and exercising isn't expensive. Fresh food is always best. But you can buy bulk frozen chicken, veg that will keep for a few weeks. Keep an eye out for reduced to clear aisles for bargains.

'Losing weight doesn't mean making drastic changes, drinking water instead of fizzy pop can make a huge difference.'

Kelii Grauer from Body Burn Online agrees.

She said: 'There is a common misconception among many people like Christina that living an active healthy lifestyle is more expensive than choosing not to. These people may have a basic understanding of what encompasses a healthy lifestyle, however they may not have the education to make the choices, nor the knowledge on how to prioritise their own lives in order to get them there.

'The reality is that with a little planning and creativity, eating fresh and healthy is actually far less of a strain on the wallet, especially when planning meals for the whole family. 'When it comes to exercise, simply going for a short walk or light jog is the perfect place to start for beginners. The first step is always the hardest, but if you want to make the commitment to change, I guarantee that it will be the best thing that will happen in your life. For those wanting a little more or take their journey further, Body Burn Online can take you there with our one-stop shop to all your fitness and wellbeing in the comfort of your own home.'
