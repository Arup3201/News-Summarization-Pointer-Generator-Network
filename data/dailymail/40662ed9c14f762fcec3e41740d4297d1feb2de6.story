He may be more known for his outlandish character and raucous behaviour, but Mario Balotelli has been reminding everyone he has a softer side.

The Liverpool striker took to Instagram on Monday to post a picture of him sleeping next to his baby daughter Pia. 

The Italy international announced he was the father to the two-year-old a little over a year ago after having it proved conclusively by a positive DNA test.

And Balotelli showed off his paternal side as he took a nap with Pia the day after Liverpool boosted their top four hopes with a 2-1 win against Manchester City.

Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho struck brilliant goals either side of an Edin Dzeko equaliser as Rodgers' side made it eight wins in the last 10 league games.

The win moved the Reds above Southampton into sixth place just two points behind Manchester United in fourth and three behind third-place Arsenal.

The former City striker did not feature in the clash on Sunday as the 24-year-old continues to find game-time and goals limited at Liverpool.

Balotelli hasn't started a Premier League game for the Anfield club since November and has only scored four goals from 23 appearances since joining from AC Milan last summer.
