A devoted bride has given her new husband the ultimate wedding gift – a kidney.

Lisa Parcel, 27, is making the sacrifice for her husband Lee, a diabetes sufferer who has endured ‘nightmare years’ of chronic ill health.

Mr Parcel is set to go under the knife for the potentially life-saving operation after his bride was found to be a successful match.

Lisa Parcel, 27, is to give her husband Lee, 33, one of her kidneys. Lee is a diabetes sufferer who has endured 'nightmare years' of chronic ill health including developing kidney failure and suffering a stroke

The organ pledge is even more remarkable because Mrs Parcel is petrified of pain.

‘It really is the perfect wedding present,’ said Mr Parcel, from Rhondda, Wales.

Mental health nurse, Mrs Parcel, said she was more than prepared to make the sacrifice for her beloved husband.

‘In all honesty, I'm a bit of a wimp - any sort of pain normally scares me,’ she said.

‘But this is different. This operation will benefit both of us as Lee will be able to live a more normal life.’

Now 33, Mr Parcel was diagnosed with stage five kidney failure two years ago after falling ill on holiday in Spain.

The couple got married in Cardiff Bay in June and are hoping that the kidney transplant operation will take place in about six months

He was put on emergency dialysis with both kidneys functioning at only five per cent of their full capacity.

His
health then took a catastrophic turn for the worse in February 2012 
when he suffered a stroke caused by dangerously high blood pressure.

He was put into a medically-induced coma by doctors at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant, who later transferred him to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff to see kidney specialists.

After learning how to walk again, Mr Parcel recovered and can administer his own blood-filtering dialysis treatment at home.

He is now six to nine months away from getting a new kidney.

The couple, who had been childhood sweethearts and dated for 13 years, finally tied the knot in June in Cardiff Bay, and now live in Cardiff with their two dogs.

‘It really is the perfect wedding present,’ Mr Parcel said.

‘But this gift isn't anything I can really repay or give back.

‘She is going through all of this for me and I will never be able to show my thanks enough.

‘I will just have to look after it as much as possible.’

Kidneys filter waste products from the blood before converting them to urine.

But if they lose this ability then waste products can build up, which is potentially life-threatening.

People can function normally with just one working kidney.

A seven-year-old girl is finally able to live life to the full after being given one of her mother’s kidneys.

Keira Murphy-Johnston can now do things that other children take for granted, such as taking dips in the swimming pool and wolfing down pizza, after the successful organ transplant.

When she was born with kidney failure her mother Nikki, 26, from Birmingham, vowed to one day become a donor for her.

Keira Murphy-Johnston, seven, was given a new kidney by her mother, Nikki. Keira was born with kidney failure and was dependent upon dialysis for years

‘Keira's the happiest girl ever,’ she said.

‘When Keira grows up she wants to be a nurse. She said she wants to help everyone else and teach them to be brave and not be scared. It breaks my heart.’

Keira started school in September, 2010, just three months after undergoing the four-hour surgery at Birmingham Children's Hospital.

Without the operation Keira would have only been able to attend school two days a week, her mother believes.

When Keira was born with kidney failure her mother vowed to one day become a donor for her. The operation eventually took place in 2010

Before the surgery she had to have four hours of dialysis four times a week.

Nikki said: ‘In the last year she's been the best ever.

‘She's been putting on weight - that child doesn't stop eating. Put her in front of a pizza or curry and they're gone.

‘She's going to school every day. She 
seems to be really catching up. She's doing really well there and has 
made lots of friends.’

Keira can also fully enjoy family days out, with her mother, father Ian, 37, half-sister Eleanor, ten, sister Josie, six, and baby brother Lenny, one.

Nikki said: ‘Because she was so weak we couldn't really go on family days out without having to take her pushchair.

‘It was always quite uncomfortable for Keira having nose tubes, children would be looking and she wouldn't understand.

‘Now she is confident in herself and we don't have to worry all the time.’
