The Great British Bake Off winner Frances Quinn says she was in 'complete and utter shock' after being crowned victor of the TV show.

Children's clothes designer Quinn, 31, beat former model Ruby Tandoh, 21, and psychologist Kimberley Wilson, 30, in the hotly anticipated BBC Two final.

The programme drew an astonishing peak of 9.1million viewers, drawing more than twice as many viewers as ITV’s UEFA Champions League clash between Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund and BBC1’s Holby City, both seen by 4.1 million.

The episode, which had an average of 8.4m viewers, also had more successful ratings than last Saturday night's X Factor show - proving just why it will be moving to BBC1 next year.

Do you think Frances was the right Bake Off winner?

Amateur baker Quinn wowed judges Paul 
Hollywood and Mary Berry with a rainbow-style savoury picnic pie and 
showstopper three-tier wedding cake, inspired by Shakespeare's A 
Midsummer Night's Dream, on the show.

But she said it had been hard to keep her win under wraps for so long following the pre-recorded last episode.

'I've been back at work and trying to keep a poker face,' Quinn said.

'I remember watching the Wimbledon final the following week and getting so emotional... and thinking at least Andy Murray doesn't have to hide his trophy under his bed for the next three months.

'I'm looking forward to being able to celebrate with my incredibly close family and friends.'

Quinn dismissed reports about chemistry between Hollywood and Tandoh, who was crowned star baker three times, saying: 'We were not thinking about any of that in there... There was no flirtation.'

But she admitted there was some flirtation elsewhere in the Bake Off tent.

'We [the contestants] were each flirting with each other if we needed to, for more parchment paper or another spoon if they were still being washed up out the back,' she admitted.

Now Quinn said that her next quest is to find herself the perfect man - with one specific attribute.

She told The Sun: 'Whoever he may be, I hope he will have a healthy appetite. Someone who is 6ft would be good!'

Frances added: 'Being on the show has not quite been blind date to baking date.'

But Frances also revealed that her future partner will have to get used to some of her own unique personality traits.

She told the Mirror: 'I
 know I’m random and slightly eccentric. But if I can bring that 
eclectic mix of things into the kitchen, into the bowl, then so be it.'

The time has come: Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry had a hard task ahead of them as the show kicked off 

Nervous: Frances struggled with nerves as the first task started

Result: Frances impressed the judges when she presented a rainbow picnic pie in the first challenge

Quinn, who decorated her wedding cake
 with edible confetti made from beetroot, mango, rhubarb and sweet 
potato, said she had a rest from baking after winning the show.

'I thought my blood sugar levels would go through the roof. I had a bit of a sabbatical,' she said.Quinn has been approached by agents and wants to produce a coffee table book.

'I
 don't know what the future is going to hold but it does excite me,' she
 said. 'What I'd love to do is combine both passions, baking and design.

Let's go: Kimberley made a chicken and pig pie for the first challenge

Reflective: As per usual Ruby wasn't particularly confident about her skills

Support: Ruby found she had Sue on hand for support during the first challenge

Rare smile: Ruby relaxed a little bit when she realised she had managed to create layers

'The baking market is completely 
saturated so I don't want to do a book that's anything like one that's 
already out there. I'd like to create a book that's got all my rough 
sketches and ideas.'

Quinn,
 who lives in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, said she was not 
considering leaving her design job any time yet - but any extra cash on 
the back of her success will go down well.

'I'd
 start to get a bit more furniture in my house. The kitchen looks very 
well stocked but the rest of the house, not so much,' she said. 'But 
forget millionaires, it's going to be about creating more millionaire 
shortbreads.

Falling short: Frances came last in the technical challenge with some disappointing sweet and savoury pretzels

Winner: Kimberley impressed with her pretzel and won the second challenge

Struggle: Ruby complained that she couldn't remember what a pretzel looked like

'Work has been so, so supportive. I'm not going to say yea or nay to anything at the moment. I've got a mortgage to pay.'

Quinn
 said she could not believe her ears when the judges announced she had 
won the fourth series of the show, which has seen viewing figures rocket
 and is set to move to BBC1 next year.

'I
 don't think I could speak for a little while. It was complete and utter
 shock. It was so close, such a close final,' she said. 'I think it was 
the wedding cake at the end that really did swing it.'

Not enough: Ruby's wedding cake was lacking in the flavour it needed

Presentation: Kimberley was let down with the decoration on her wedding cake

Upset: Ruby once again breaks down in tears after her cake isn't quite the success she hoped

Off: Paul told Ruby that the colours of her cake didn't quite work

Quinn,
 who had been criticised by the judges for style over substance, said 
she was persuaded to apply for Bake Off by family and friends.

She added: 'I had thought of 
applying. But it was just, I didn't know whether I was good enough or 
whether I wanted that exposure. I didn't know whether I should go about 
it in my own way.'

She insisted there was no antagonism between the all-women finalists.

'We
 all get on. People want to feel there was more competition than was the
 case. The emotions you go through in that tent, you never want to see 
anyone get that criticism. Outside the tent we're just supportive of 
each other.

Deliberating: The judges sit down with Mel and Sue to discuss how they have fared over the competition

Prestigious: Frances was able to walk away with the coveted Bake Off stand

'It's a reality show but we know the actual reality that went on.'

She
 said of the judges: 'We didn't really have that much time to spend with
 them. We got to know [presenters] Mel and Sue a lot more. A lot of 
people said that the judges were quite severe with their criticism but I
 took it as constructive.'

Quinn's
 savoury pie contained two types of trout and five different vegetables,
 while her wedding cake consisted of ginger and rhubarb, lemon sponge 
and raspberries and a third tier of carrot, orange, pistachio and 
apricot.

Following the airing of The Great British Bake Off finale on Tuesday night, tickets to judge Paul's show Paul Hollywood Live: Get Your Bake On spiked by 216% after going on sale on Wednesday morning, according to viagogo.

Viagogo spokesperson Steve Roest said: 'Paul Hollywood’s tour is the icing on the cake for fans of the show looking for another baking fix.

'He will not only be sharing his tricks of the trade, but also choosing a select few from the audience to bake with him, making it an unmissable event for enthusiasts looking to improve their skills under the critical gaze of ol’ blue eyes.'
