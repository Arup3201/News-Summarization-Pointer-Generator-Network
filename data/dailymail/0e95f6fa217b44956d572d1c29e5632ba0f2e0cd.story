Avoidable: If patients are moved around and their mattresses turned bedsores can be avoided (posed by model)

Bedsores are killing almost as many hospital patients as the deadly superbug MRSA in 'completely avoidable' deaths.

And treating sufferers, who develop the ulcers when they are not moved enough, is costing four per cent of the NHS budget.

The sores, known as pressure ulcers, cause hundreds of deaths a year.

And they take hold when bed-bound patients are not regularly turned over or given special mattresses by nurses.

Most victims are elderly or long-term patients who need help to move.

The worst offending hospitals have been named in a bid to end the epidemic.

The statistics were drawn up by NHS standards watchdog Dr Foster after a survey of 150 hospitals.

And the worst had pressure ulcer rates four times higher than the national average.

Bedsores affected 412,000 NHS patients a year and the latest figures show they killed 4,708 people between 2003 and 2008 close to the MRSA death-toll.

Two years ago Muriel Browning, 96, died at Suffolk's Ipswich Hospital after a hip operation.

Her daughter Angela claimed she was left for hours in dirty nappies, causing a sore that infected a surgical wound and killed her.

Angela said: 'Nurses couldn't be 
bothered to take patients to the toilet. Its dreadful. But she was 
left for hours in soiled and wet nappies.

'As a result she developed a massive sore on her torso'.  

Within a month of being admitted Mrs Browning was dead from an infection that got into her surgical wound.

Unison's nursing union chief Gail Adams claimed Government moves to save £20billion in the NHS could make the crisis even worse.

She said: 'Thousands of nurses are losing their jobs and this could lead to a rise in the number of patients with bedsores.'

Action Against Medical Accidents say they are completely avoidable. 

Chief Executive Peter Walsh said: 'It's down to poor nursing care and there should be zero tolerance of bedsores.

But sadly they are accepted and it leads to a lot of misery and suffering for patients and their relatives.

'These are highly preventable. Stopping them is not rocket science. But in many hospitals they happen too easily.' 

The new league reveals that Cheshire's Warrington and Halton Hospitals Trust has the worst bedsores record.

It is followed by the Medway Trust in
Kent, Southend University Hospital Trust in Essex, Royal Bolton 
Hospital in Greater Manchester and West Herts Trust, which covers 
Watford General.

The final five on the list, with the lowest rate of bedsores, are Luton and 
Dunstable Hospital Trust, West Suffolk Hospitals Trust, Northern Devon 
Healthcare Trust, George Eliot Hospital Trust in Nuneaton, Warwicks, and
Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust.

The shamed hospitals were quick to insist they were taking action.

A Warrington spokesman said: The prevention and reporting of ulcers has been strengthened over the past year.

And the Royal Bolton said: A great deal of work has been undertaken to make improvements.

But Southend chiefs disputed the accuracy of the statistics.

The league table comes at a time when NHS care standards are already under the microscope.
