From sold-out gadgets to discarded cheese sandwiches, there's nothing that can't be found on eBay. 

And as the UK website celebrates its 15th birthday, three savvy sellers have spoken of how it made them millionaires. 

Mark Radcliffe, Anthony Ponsford and Alison Abruneiras are among the thousands of British eBay millionaires who made their fortunes trading on the site.

Mark Radcliffe was the first British eBay millionaire after setting up First2Save in 1999 from his parents' garden shed

Alison Abruneiras and Anthony Ponsford have also made more than £1million by trading with independent retailers online 

Selling coveted goods at fixed prices, the entrepreneurs are among millions of online stores which transformed the site from an auctioneers to a virtual marketplace. 

The first Brit to make £1million from eBay sales was Mark Radcliffe, a former Tesco shelf-stacker from Stockport, Manchester. 

The 35-year-old put aside £200 from his wages to launch First2Save - a one stop eBay shop for mobile phones and technological accessories. 

Fifteen years after starting the business from his parents' garden shed, the businessman said he owes everything to the website. 

'I could have continued working at Tesco and become a manager but it would not have stretched me. 

'I still have to pinch myself - it's a dream come true,' he told the Sun. 

Speaking on the 10th anniversary of his company's launch, Mr Radcliffe said anyone was capable of accomplishing what he had with the right knowledge and skills.  

'I couldn't have got where I am today without the right people to help. Also being aware of the latest technology has always been important,'

'First2save has come a long way in ten years and it's astonishing what we've managed to achieve.

'The internet means that virtually anyone can succeed in business from a low start-up point. All it takes is a lot of hard work and determination.'

Anthony Ponsford abandoned his job as a city lawyer to start his wheeler-dealer business, Piranha Trading Limited. 

Among items on sale are camera memory cards, bric-a-brac desks and pet furniture from China. 

The 44-year-old of Shepperton, London, describes himself as the real-life Del Boy. 

'I often joke to people that I've basically set up an online version of Trotter's Independent Traders,' he said. 

'It started out, as many things do, as a very small enterprise turning over a very marginal profit for quite some time.

'I have to admit my heart sank when the bottom fell out of the market during the recession.

'When Lehman Brothers collapsed and the value of the pound dropped 40 per cent against the dollar I was fully expecting the business to fold.

'But weirdly, I think it actually helped in a way, because people were still looking to buy things like computer desks and office furniture but were now after more of a bargain.

'Where people previously went to John Lewis, they turned to the internet. And because we don't have any retail premises or massive overheads it worked in our favour.' 

Alison Abruneiras, a mother-of-three from Lincoln, started using eBay to distract herself from the fact she had cancer. 

After having to stop work as a nail technician when she was diagnosed with the disease, the 46-year-old became addicted to the online retailer and decided to launch her own shop.

Six years after the Nail and Beauty Emporium was started, it now trades with buyers all over the world.

'The UK will spend an unprecedented £45 billion shopping online this year and the evolution of eBay over the past 15 years is a good illustration of how retail in Britain has been transformed,' said Tanya Lawler, Vice President, eBay in the UK. 

Ebay was founded in 1995 by Pierre Omidyar in California. 

The website, known then as Auction Web, changed its name and was quickly picked up by countries all over the world. 

Today, ebay.co.uk has more than 19million monthly users, and has traded £65billion worth of goods since its launch in 1999.
