It was the game banned in a sixth of British playgrounds - but one school has bucked the trend by encouraging pupils to collect as many conkers as possible.

And some 400 pupils at Clifton Green Primary School in York, North Yorkshire, took part in the unusual harvest collection - bringing in a staggering 50,000 conkers over a ten-day period.

Local business The Churchill Hotel had agreed to sponsor the collection for 10p per conker - albeit to a maximum of £250, while a Vauxhall dealer had also given £100.

The venture ended up raising a total of £1,300, with all of it going to Martin House Children’s Hospice in nearby Boston Spa, West Yorkshire.

Community outreach worker John Hattam said the school came up with the idea while making plans for its annual harvest celebration at Clifton Methodist Church in the city tomorrow.

He added: ‘We decided to do something that all the children could do, that would get them out and about with their families and raise money for the hospice.

‘But we never expected them to collect so many. We have filled about ten 80-litre boxes. One family alone collected about 2,000 conkers.’

School employee Claire Neal said: ‘It’s a conservative guess that there are 50,000 conkers. 

'All the conkers are in the school in boxes at the moment and it would take a long time to count each individual one.

‘We are hoping that somebody might buy them and we have offered the children to take them home. 

'There has been a lot of talk that conkers help to keep spiders away from the house so some people might want a few to help with that.

‘The children have done it all in their own time and it has been a real family effort. That’s what we are all about at the school, family and community.

‘The idea is based on the harvest festival and all the children have loved it. Teachers have got involved with their families and all the money will go to Martin House children’s hospice.’

The Daily Mail reported in 2011 on a survey claiming traditional school games such as conkers and leapfrog were dying out because over-protective teachers had irrational fears about health and safety.

Researchers found that conkers had been banned from nearly one sixth of playgrounds for fear that they could cause injury or trigger a nut allergy, even though they are not nuts.

Clifton Green - which caters for 429 pupils aged from three to 11 - was rated in its latest Ofsted report in May as 'good', which was up from its previous rating in 2013 of 'requires improvement'.
