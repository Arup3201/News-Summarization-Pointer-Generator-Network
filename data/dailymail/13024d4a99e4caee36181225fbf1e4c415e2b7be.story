A British aid worker had allegedly been killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza. 

The Foreign Office has said it is investigating reports that the man died on Sunday night in the southern city of Rafah.

Friends of Kadir Islam, from Rochdale, said he was killed yesterday in an Israeli strike while reportedly delivering supplies to a hospital.

It was not clear which aid group he was representing, reported The Times.

Prime Minister David Cameron said the Government is urgently looking into the news. 

Mr Cameron said: 'I'm extremely concerned about these reports and we are doing everything we can to get to the bottom (of them) and find out exactly what has happened.

'I don't want to say anything before we've been able to do that but this only reinforces the need for an immediate unconditional humanitarian ceasefire observed properly by both sides.

'This slaughter, this killing has got to end.'

Last week three UN workers were killed in the Gaza Strip, the first deaths of the development agency's workforce.

The three teachers - two women and one man - were killed by 'incoming [Israeli] fire'.

An Israeli-declared temporary cease-fire and troop withdrawals slowed violence in the Gaza war today, although an attack on an Israeli bus that killed one person in Jerusalem underscored the tensions still simmering in the region.

Several cease-fires have broken down during the three-week war - including Friday when an internationally negotiated truce collapsed amid violence and mutual recrimination between Israel and Hamas.

But with Hamas rocket fire tapering off over the last 24 hours and Israel's ground operation in Gaza winding down, violence in a war that officials say has killed more than 1,880 Palestinians and over 60 Israelis appeared - for the moment - to be waning.

The lull was broken by the Jerusalem assault, which saw a man ram the front end of a construction excavator into an Israeli bus. 

Police described the incident as a 'terrorist attack,' indicating Palestinian involvement.

The attack occurred on a main thoroughfare near Jerusalem's light-rail line.

The area is located near the unofficial line between Jewish West Jerusalem and east Jerusalem, the section of the city captured by Israel in 1967 and which is home to most of the city's Arab population. Israeli media said the attacker came from an Arab area of the city.

Shortly after the excavator attack, Israeli media reported that a gunman on a motorcycle shot and seriously wounded an Israeli soldier. Police searched for the shooter in east Jerusalem.

'We believe there is a great likelihood this was a terrorist attack,' Piranti said.

Before the attacks, a seven-hour Israeli cease-fire in Gaza went into effect. And while Israel continued hitting at selected Palestinian targets, the level of the fighting was much lower than in previous days.

However, the Israeli military said the cease-fire would not apply to areas where troops were still operating and where they would respond to any attack. The southern strip town of Rafah, which saw heavy fighting Sunday, was excluded from the truce, the military said.

Shortly after the cease-fire started at 10 a.m. (0700 GMT), an Israeli strike hit a house at the Shati refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip, killing three people and wounding at least 30, Gaza health official Ashraf al-Kidra said.

 The Israeli military said it targeted an 'operative threat' and rocket fire in the strike 'around 10 a.m.'

A separate Israeli strike killed Daniel Mansour, a commander in the Islamic Jihad group - a close ally of Gaza's militant Palestinian Hamas rulers, the group said.

Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said his group remained skeptical about the announced Israeli truce.

'We do not trust such a calm and call on our people to take caution,' Zuhri said.

Since the war began, Palestinian health officials say at least 1,888 Palestinians have been killed

Israel launched the military operation in Gaza on July 8 in response to weeks of heavy rocket fire.

It has since carried out more than 4,600 airstrikes across the crowded seaside area.

On July 17, it sent in ground forces in what it said was a mission to destroy the tunnels used by Hamas to carry out attacks inside Israel.

Hamas has fired more than 3,200 rockets into Israel during the war, with some intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome defense system and many of the crude missiles landing in open areas away from cities.

Since the war began, Palestinian health officials say at least 1,888 Palestinians have been killed. 

Most of the Palestinian casualties have been civilians, while all but three of the 64 people killed in Israel have been in the military.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under increasing international pressure to halt the fighting because of the heavy civilian death toll in Gaza.
