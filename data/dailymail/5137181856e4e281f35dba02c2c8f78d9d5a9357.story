As church bells tolled at the funeral of a beloved Sandy Hook teacher whose body was found cradling the student she tried to save, Cardinal Timothy Dolan praised her bravery and compassion by comparing her to Jesus.

Special education teacher Anne Marie Murphy, 52, died trying to shield her students from bullets after gunman Adam Lanza opened fire at the Connecticut elementary school on Friday.

Mrs Murphy, a married mother of four, was found still cradling Dylan Hockley, who she had tried to protect. The six-year-old British boy, who had special needs, also died from his wounds.

'Like Jesus, Annie laid down her 
life for her friends,' the Cardinal told mourners at St. Mary of the Assumption Church in Katonah, New York on Thursday.

Kind words: Cardinal Timothy Dolan spoke at the funeral, where he likened Murphy's sacrifice to Jesus'

'Like Jesus, Annie's life and death 
brings light, truth, goodness and love to a world often shrouded in 
darkness, evil, selfishness and death.'

Dolan added that, following the tragedy, Mrs Murphy had helped unify a country moved by what she had done, bringing together 'a community, a nation, a world, now awed by her own life and death'.

He said that he had never met Murphy but 'because I know Jesus, I feel as if I know Anne Marie McGowan Murphy 
quite well'.

'Like Jesus, Annie was an excellent teacher,' he explained. 
'Like Him, she had a favored place in her big, tender heart for children,
especially those with struggles.'

Dylan's parents, who moved with their
two sons from Hampshire in England to the U.S. two years ago, 
previously paid tribute to the loving teacher.

'We take great comfort in knowing that Dylan was not alone when he died,
but was wrapped in the arms of his amazing aide, Anne Marie Murphy,' 
they said.

'Dylan loved Mrs. Murphy so much and 
pointed at her picture on our refrigerator every day.'

Hundreds
of mourners attended the church to bid farewell to the teacher who had 
worked at Sandy Hook for more than a dozen years. Around 100 people had 
to wait outside after the church filled up.

As
the bell tolled, a wooden casket was 
carried up the steps, with dozens of Mrs Murphy's relatives following 
somberly behind. She is survived by her children, husband, her parents 
and six siblings.

Relatives said Mrs Murphy's children had discovered the 
Christmas presents she had bought for them after her death. At her 
wake, they placed a stocking on top of her coffin.

Ahead of Thursday's service, Mrs Murphy's brother-in-law Thomas Newman read a brief statement sending love and support to the families of the other victims of the massacre.

They 'pray, for all the families touched so terribly, that God may
help these feelings of such great pain and grief pass quickly; that 
they be replaced with only happy thoughts and joyous memories of those 
we have lost,' he said.

Speaking to Fox News, friend Janelle Wingert said Mrs Murphy had asked her after 9/11 what she would do if someone attacked her at the school where she worked.

'She was serious and so intense in 
the question,' Wingert said. 'She died doing exactly 
what she said she would do - put herself between the gunman and her 
little ones, who she saw as the most precious of all in God's heart.'

Mrs Murphy was among the 20 students and six teachers killed when Adam Lanza, armed with a military-style assault rifle, broke into the school in Newtown last week and opened fire.

Lanza had killed his mother at their home before driving to the school to attack her colleagues and students. He committed suicide at the school as police closed in.

Dolan decided to preach at her funeral 'to express his support for all who lost their lives in Newtown and their families,' Archdiocese of New York spokesman Joseph Zwilling said.

'Just being present, even in our silence - we can make that silence a prayer.'

Another teacher, 30-year-old Lauren Rousseau, was also buried on Thursday, six days after she was shot at point-blank range with her entire class of students. She was a substitute for the regular teacher who was on maternity leave.

Ahead of her death, her boyfriend Tony Lousardi gave an emotional interview in which he said: 'I only got one year with her. But it was a really good year. I'm convinced that I'll see her again.'

Speaking to CNN, he said he was over the moon when Sandy Hook hired Lauren after she had been searching for a job for so many years. He added that she did not have a mean bone in her body.

Breaking down in tears he added: 
'It's kinda bad to say, but I'm jealous of her friends that got more 
than one year with her. I only got one.'

Three students were laid to rest on Thursday, while six others were memorialised.

At the funeral for Benjamin Wheeler in Newtown, Connecticut, Boy Scouts lined the entrance to the church - paying tribute to the six-year-old, who was a Tiger Scout.

In nearby Southbury, mourners tied green balloons to trees around town in honor of six-year-old Allison Wyatt, who is being buried today as well.

The parents of animal-lover Catherine Hubbard, 6, asked for the prayers of their friends and neighbors as they prepared to say goodbye to her at a funeral service in Newtown.
