One of the woman who has recently come forward to accuse Bill Cosby of inappropriate behavior has a long, and varied, criminal history.

Linda Joy Traitz, of Hallandale Beach, Florida, said earlier this week that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drove her out to a beach and tried to get her to take pills to relax, before becoming 'sexual aggressive.'

Now, it has been revealed that Traitz herself has found herself in trouble with the law in the past, including on charges of trafficking pills.

According to TMZ, 'Traitz got out of prison in 2012 after serving more than 3 years for trafficking Oxycodone, possession of a controlled substance and obtaining a controlled substance by fraud.'

That's not all either, as she has also been charged and/or arrested in the past for a number of other crimes, ranging from ID fraud and battery to theft and various drug offenses. 

And now, Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, is trying to use Traitz's past to discredit her claims against his client.

Criminal: Traitz has been charged and/or arrested in the past for a number of crimes, ranging from ID fraud and battery to theft and various drug offenses

Singer called Traitz 'the latest example of people coming out of the woodwork with unsubstantiated or fabricated stories about my client.' 

Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby did the same to them in the past.

Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby.

Joan Tarshis - Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him.

Janice Dickinson - The supermodel said in an interview that Cosby asked her to come to Lake Tahoe and talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her.

Tamara Green - Green, who first came forward in 2005 told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her.

Therese Serignese - Also one of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows. 

He then added, 'There was no briefcase of drugs and the story is absurd.'

Five women have come forward in the past month and claimed that they were drugged and raped by Cosby, four of them when they were teenagers.

One of the accusers is supermodel Janice Dickinson, who claims that during a dinner in 1982 the actor gave her a pill and when she woke up he was on top of her. 

The other four ladies; Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis, Tamara Green and Therese Serignese have all shared remarkably similar stories in which they claim to have shared a drink or a pill with Cosby and then woken up after or while they say he was sexually assaulting them.

Also coming forward recently is Carla Ferrigno, wife of Incredibly Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, who says Cosby tried to sexually assault her at a part at his house in 1967.

What's more, Cosby even tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after hiw own wife, Camille, left the room. 

When asked to speak about these claims in an AP interview, Cosby said he had 'no response' and 'no comment.'

These allegations are already having a major impact on his work however, with Netflix postponing the airing of his new comedy special, Bill Cosby 77, which was due to air the day after Thanksgiving, and NBC pulling the plug on a comedy project they were developing with the Cosby Show star.

Cosby has also had scheduled appearances on talk shows including The Queen Latifah Show and Late Night With David Letterman cancelled in the wake of these allegations.

TV Land has also announced they will no longer air reruns of The Cosby Show on the network.
