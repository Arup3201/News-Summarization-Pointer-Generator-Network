Offensive: ITV reporter Richard Pallot twice referred to black footballers as 'coloured'

ITV were forced to apologise today after a reporter covering a Downing Street football racism summit twice referred to black players as 'coloured'.

Richard Pallot was talking about the lack of black managers in the game when he made the mistake.

ITV admitted that the report - recorded in advance of the 1.30pm news - should have been more carefully checked before it was broadcast.

The journalist was covering the summit held by David Cameron on racism in football with leading black footballers including John Barnes and Jason Roberts.

Mr Cameron said in Parliament today that there are 'worrying' signs that racism is creeping back into football.

Following the ITV broadcast, dozens of viewers objected to the  uses of the term 'coloured' on Twitter.

In modern times, it has come to be considered offensive because it classes everyone 
who is not white as being the same.

The incident happened after Alan Hansen was forced to apologise for using the same word on Match of the Day.

The pundit, who reportedly earns £40,000 a show, said 'coloured' twice during the BBC1 programme as he talked about racism in the game in December.

After Mr Pallot used the same term, one Twitter user wrote to ITV: 'When was it okay to use the word coloured? And to make it worse is that you were talking about racism!'

Another person said: 'Why do the itv news keep saying "coloured" when they mean black. It's a bit uncomfortable to listen to..'

An ITV spokeswoman said they were sorry and the recording should never have gone out.

'ITV
 News apologises for the inappropriate use of the word "coloured" in a 
report on racism and football in today’s News at 1.30,' she said.

'We take this error very seriously and we regret any offence caused.'

Using the term 'coloured' to refer to black people is considered offensive because it dismisses everyone who is not white as the same.

The term was in widespread use in Britain in the 1960s but is now considered racist.

The problem is it suggests white people are white and everyone else is 'coloured'. There is no recognition that everyone has their own ethnic origin.

Alan Hansen sparked a row by using the term last year on the day that John Terry was charged with racially abusing Anton Ferdinand. He denies the offence.

She added that they had not uploaded the footage onto their website - and it had not been broadcast on ITV+1 an hour later.

The
 mistake happened as black footballers Jason Roberts and John Barnes 
attended a racism summit with the Prime Minister in Downing Street 
today.

Liverpool striker Luis Suarez was recently banned for racially abusing Manchester defender Patrice Evra.

When the two sides met again recently 
the Uruguayan became embroiled in a further row when he refused to shake
 the Frenchman's hand.

Mr Cameron warned that footballers 
were role models to young people, who copied what they saw at games when
 they learnt to play the game themselves.

Speaking during Prime Minister’s 
Questions in the Commons, Mr Cameron said: 'It was a huge achievement 
where Britain and its football authorities and football clubs actually 
led the world in kicking racism out of football, something that hasn’t 
happened in all other countries.

'It is worrying some of the recent signs we have seen.

'Why I think this matters, not just to
 football, but also to Government and everyone in our country, is 
because football and footballers are role models to young people.

'What people see on the football pitch, they copy when they go to learn to play football themselves.

'I think it is important to bring people together and make sure we kick racism out of football for good.'

Former Liverpool FC footballer Tommy Smith said there is more racism among footballers today than in the past, and suggested that the culprits should be jailed.

The former defender was attending an auction of his medals and shirts in Chester today.

Asked to compare racism in football today to when he was a player, he said: 'I think there is more now, because at (that) time England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales (were) part of the English league, now it is Continental players coming from Spain and Portugal.

'I think there was far less (racism) in the 60s and 70s than there is now.

'I don’t know how to stop it, unless you get one of the players and tell them you are going to put them in jail because he is messing about, and maybe that will work.'
