Nick Clegg failed to make the 25-mile trip from Westminster to Windsor Castle for a private meeting with the Queen last month, but he has managed to spend a staggering amount on long-haul travel.

I hear that in just two months this year the Deputy Prime Minister racked up a bill of more than £83,000, to be picked up by the taxpayer.

Cabinet Office records disclose that the Liberal Democrat leader spent £54,537 in February and £28,692 the previous month.

The jet-setting son of a Dutch oil executive has made as many major foreign trips in the past few months as he had in the previous three years.

British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg talks to media during his visit to the archeological site of Great Temple in Mexico City in February. He has spent £83,000 on long-haul travel in two months

The claims for January and February cover his visits to Spanish-speaking Colombia and Mexico.

Clegg’s wife, Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, 45, is Spanish.

He spent another £31,859 last September when he led a delegation of six to a United Nations gathering in Washington.

Justifying the South American trade missions, the Cabinet Office says they helped to secure business deals worth ‘hundreds of millions of pounds’.

It stresses that the travel costs include all other ministerial travel during the same month to engagements in the UK.

The Cabinet Office said the visits have helped secure 'hundreds of millions of pounds' for UK business

‘It was the biggest UK delegation ever to visit Colombia, and one of the biggest to visit Mexico,’ Clegg’s spokesman tells me.

‘Hundreds of millions of pounds of business was done during the visit and companies were introduced to new markets and potential customers that will increase trade for years to come.

‘In addition to the obvious trade benefits, political links were strengthened as the Deputy Prime Minister held meetings with the presidents and senior ministers from both countries.’

Clegg, 47, who speaks Dutch, German, Spanish and French, was joined on his trip to Colombia and Mexico by Trade and Investment Minister Lord Livingston, Mexico trade envoy Baroness Bonham-Carter and more than 40 UK business leaders.

Companies represented included HSBC bank, engine manufacturers Rolls-Royce, oil and energy firm Shell, commercial banknote printer De La Rue and architects Zaha Hadid, plus senior representatives from British universities.

Clegg should be applauded for reaching Latin America.

As I may have mentioned before, after he failed to turn up for a fourth meeting with the Queen last year, his aide spluttered: ‘The f****** fact is he can’t f****** be everywhere, but I know you are going to go off and write that the DPM has f****** snubbed the Queen once a-f******-gain.’
