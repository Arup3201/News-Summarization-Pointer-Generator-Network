Spain's stunning early exit from the World Cup sent shock waves through the football world, and leading Spanish newspaper Marca have labelled it 'The End'.

After winning Euro 2008, the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012, Spain's reign at the top of world football came to a crashing halt after their second straight defeat in Group B in Brazil.

Following their thumping 5-1 defeat by Holland in Salvador, Spain were once again beaten as Chile claimed a 2-0 victory at the Maracana in Rio De Janeiro on Wednesday.

The once great Spanish side looked slow and tired as they were sent packing, becoming the fifth reigning champions to fall at the group stage.

And the front page of Marca showed a dejected Andres Iniesta, who scored the winner in the World Cup final against Holland four years ago.

Spain coach Vicente Del Bosque said there would be 'consequences' for the national team as they plot their path back to the top.

He said: 'It’s true that when such things happen during a World Cup or a tournament like this then it has consequences but I don’t want to start thinking about that right now. We have time to analyse that and it is not the right time now.

'There will be time to think and reflect what we are going to do. I think this team is good but we have to take a decision about what is good for Spanish football and that applies to myself as well.'
