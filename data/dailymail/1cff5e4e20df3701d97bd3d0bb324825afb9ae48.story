Tony Blair today moved to reject claims his government was complicit in the torture of terrorist suspects by CIA agents.

The former Prime Minister, facing growing calls to appear before MPs over what he knew about American 'enhanced interrogation techniques when he was in Downing Street, said he had 'always been opposed to the use of torture'.

It came as the clamour for a judge-led inquiry into Britain's role in torture grew - with former Home Secretary Alan Johnson and shadow minister Yvette Cooper joining calls for the former prime minister to be quizzed on Britain's role in the barbaric treatment of prisoners by the US.

Former Prime Minister Tony Blair and the then Foreign Secretary Jack Straw are facing questions over what they knew about CIA torture

Shadow home secretary Miss Cooper yesterday broke ranks to say she believed an investigation by a judge might be needed to get to the truth about torture.

Her intervention means the Labour front bench is on the verge of supporting an inquiry that could be hugely embarrassing for both Mr Blair and David Miliband – the brother of the party's current leader.

But a spokesman for Mr Blair's office said: 'For the avoidance of doubt, Tony Blair has always been opposed to the use of torture, has always said so publicly and privately, has never condoned its use and - as is shown by internal government documentation already made public - thinks it is totally unacceptable.

'He believes the fight against radical Islamism is a fight about values, and acting contrary to those values - as in the use of torture - is therefore not just wrong but counter-productive.'

It came after MPs said former foreign secretary Jack Straw –  who has been interviewed as a 'witness' by detectives investigating the rendition of two Libyan dissidents – must also be held to account.

Last night, former Tory Attorney General Dominic Grieve backed the calls for a judge-led inquiry once the police investigations are over, saying it was needed to provide 'finality'.

And former shadow home secretary David Davis told Sky News a judge must take charge. He said: 'One must understand the sheer weight of pressure that comes from the Establishment to try and stop this sort of stuff coming out, so I think this needs to be a judicial inquiry.'

At Westminster, the weekend was dominated by the continued fallout from last week's Senate Intelligence Committee report, which detailed how detainees had been subjected to torture such as waterboarding.

Mr Cameron continues to cling to the position that an inquiry by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee is the best way of finding out the level of Britain's involvement.

In a publicity blitz, ISC chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind yesterday said he had asked the Senate committee to reveal the redactions, requested by British security officials, which led to all mention of MI5 and MI6 being removed from the 499-page report.

Sir Malcolm Rifkind told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show this morning that he would seek to question former ministers over Britain's role or complicity in torture

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said her 'instinct' was to call for a full judicial inquiry into UK torture

Home Secretary Theresa May has insisted she did not request any redactions to an American report that exposed brutal CIA interrogation methods in a bid to cover up any UK involvement.

Mrs May did concede that officials had requested that no evidence was included in the Senate Intelligence Committee's report that would damage national security.

But she told the Home Affairs Select Committee she could not speak for previous Governments.

Her appearance before the Committee comes as the Government faces mounting cross-party calls for a new judicial inquiry into Britain's possible role in the shocking treatment of detainees in the years after the September 11 attacks.

Committee chair Keith Vaz said he would be asking US Senator Dianne Feinstein, who chairs the American committee that published the CIA torture report, and a Republican, to give evidence next year.

The Home Secretary said she had not read the full 6,000-page report and had only seen the 500-page summary made publicly available

'I have certainly not asked for any redactions to take place in the report,' she said.

'The only time I met Senator Feinstein was in September of this year and I've not seen the draft report, I've not asked for any redactions in that report. We discussed other things.'

He also said his committee would ask any former or serving minister with a contribution to make to give evidence – putting the spotlight firmly on Mr Blair, Mr Straw and Mr Miliband.

Sir Malcolm added: 'If they refuse to do so, that in itself would imply they have something to hide. If there is evidence they knew or were involved then of course they would be priority figures for our investigation.

'If people deserve to be embarrassed it's our job to embarrass them. We have a statutory obligation to carry out this task without fear or favour.'

However, he admitted that he had no way of compelling the Americans to hand over an uncensored copy of the report. He also conceded he could not say he was 'confident' of success.

Home Secretary Theresa May will be grilled today by the Home Affairs Select Committee on the extent of her contact with the Senate committee and whether she personally lobbied for any redactions.

ISC member George Howarth said it was right to seek details of redacted material but questioned why it should come from the US. He said the priority should be to seek answers directly from the Government and intelligence agencies. The Labour MP added: 'It could take months and what we are asking for already exists in London.'

Miss Cooper said she doubted the ISC 'have the capacity and the scope' to carry out an inquiry, adding that her 'instinct' was that a judge-led process would still be required to ensure confidence. 

She told the BBC that Mr Blair and other former ministers had 'always said that they would co-operate with all investigations and have said that they would be very keen to do so'.

Miss Cooper added that it was important to get to the truth to make sure there was no 'shadow of innuendo or allegations cast over the vital work that the [security] agencies rightly do to keep us all safe every day of the week'.

Former home secretary Mr Johnson said Mr Straw and Mr Blair should go before the committee.

Asked on the Andrew Marr show if they should give evidence, he said: 'Yes, absolutely, yes.'

Former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott also called for a judicial inquiry. He wrote in his Sunday Mirror column: 'We must have a transparent system that reflects our values of fair play and justice, not one that turns a blind eye and deaf ear to claims of the abduction and torture of innocent people.'

A Parliamentary committee has called on the US government to hand over any evidence of British complicity in torture.

Last week a US Senate report exposed the 'brutal' treatment of al-Qaeda terror suspects in the wake of 9/11.

Downing Street has admitted that some material was removed from the report at the UK's request, for national security reasons.

But it said no redactions related to British involvement in the mistreatment of prisoners.

The House of Commons Intelligence and Security Committee is conducting an inquiry into the treatment of detainees by British intelligence agencies in the decade following 9/11.

Sir Malcolm Rifkind, who heads the intelligence committee, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show it would request to see redacted material in the Senate's public report if it referenced the UK.

He said that if British intelligence officials were present when people were being tortured then they were complicit in that torture.

'That would be quite against all the standards of this country, it would be something that ought to be brought into the public domain,' Sir Malcolm added.

Tory Defence Secretary Michael Fallon called for Mr Straw and Mr Blair to reveal what they knew about the CIA's torture and rendition programme when they were in office.

He said: 'Obviously it's for them, it's for former ministers to account for the relationship then. I hope they will co-operate with any parliamentary inquiry.'

Civil liberties groups and campaigning MPs accuse Britain of repeatedly turning a blind eye to torture during Mr Blair's 'war on terror' – when he worked hand in glove with the Bush administration.

There are allegations that British agents were present when torture took place and that the UK helped with rendition flights. Yesterday, one of the two psychologists who were paid to run the interrogation programme by the CIA insisted UK agents were at torture sites. Dr James Mitchell, who devised the brutal 'enhanced interrogation' programmes, said: 'I'd see their special operations people at the sites I would visit.'

Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said the ISC and police investigations into the Libyan renditions should be allowed to 'run their course'.

He added: 'If at the end of it, it doesn't appear that the truth is emerging, that people imagine there is some kind of cover-up, then of course a judge-led inquiry is the right way to proceed.'

Isabella Sankey of human rights group Liberty said: 'Until our Government sets up a transparent, judicial inquiry, cover-up and official impunity will persist.'
