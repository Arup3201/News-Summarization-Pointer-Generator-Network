Broke: Former NFL star Warren Sapp, pictured, is selling his entire collection of Air Jordans to pay off debts

If you're a fan of sneakers, and happen to be a size 15, you're in luck.

Warren Sapp's entire collection of rare Air Jordans is up for auction as creditors claw back cash from the former NFL star who filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, according to TMZ.

The epic collection of the classic shoe, designed and produced for Nike by now-retired basketball legend Michael Jordan, comprises 240 pairs, and is worth around $6,500.

Some pairs are worn, some have never been touched.

Sapp filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in April claiming he'd racked up millions of dollars in debts since he retired from the NFL.

The 39-year-old's debts include hundreds of thousands of dollars that he owes in child support payments to four different mothers.

His pricy shoe addiction probably didn't help stave off his money meltdown.

But Sapp's loss could now be your gain because he's selling up his entire closet-full of Jordans with all proceeds going towards paying back his creditors.

Air Jordans were first released onto the sneaker market in 1985 and Michael Jordan himself first wore them as a rookie in 1984. Originals from the 1980's fetch up to $600 a pair.

The line, which is now sold by the Jordan Brand subsidiary of Nike, releases new designs annually, with the Air Jordan 2012 style being promoted with the tagline: 'One Shoe. Three Flights.'

In court documents, Sapp - a 12-year NFL veteran and former Oakland Raiders defensive lineman - gave a full rundown of his bleak financial situation.

According to TMZ, Sapp owes more than $6.7 million to various creditors.

On top of the hefty child support 
payments, the 39-year-old owes $853,000 to the IRS for 2006, another 
$89,000 for 2010 and $2,858 in medical bills for 'Corrective Speech and 
Language Therapy.'

In
the papers, Sapp said he only has $6.45 million to his name and as well
as his prized Jordans, lists a boxing glove signed by Muhammad Ali, a 
painting of a large nude woman, a lion skin rug and Nike golf clubs as 
assets.

Sapp last played 
professional football in 2007 for the Raiders, where he played since 
2004 after being drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1995.
