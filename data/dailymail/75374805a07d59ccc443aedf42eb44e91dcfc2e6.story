A 1-year-old girl was shot in the head and left clinging to life as she sat in a car with her parents in what suburban Seattle police initially described as an apparent case of road rage. 

The baby was in 'very critical condition' Friday, a day after the shooting, said Susan Gregg, a spokeswoman for Harborview Medical Center in Seattle.

Baby Malaja was in a car seat in the back of a silver Chevrolet Impala and her parents were in the front seat when a black car pulled alongside around at 4.30pm Thursday, Kent police spokeswoman Melanie Robinson said.

Target: Police say a black car pulled alongside this silver Chevrolet Impala carrying Malaja and the driver and passenger opened fire, striking the 1-year-old in the head

On the road: The shooting took place at an intersection near an apartment complex in Kent, Washington

Robinson said the driver and passenger of the black car opened fire, then drove off, but police did not give details on the possible conflict between the people in both vehicles.

The shooting took place at an intersection near the Lake Fenwick Estates apartment complex in Kent.

Detectives in Kent initially suggested road rage as a motive, but Cmdr. Jarod Kasner told The Seattle Times Friday that police no longer think that's the case after further investigation. Police didn't provide further details on what they believe led to the shooting. 

Police said the shooting was preceded by some sort of an exchange between the occupants of the black sedan and the silver Chevy.   

Linda Johnston, who lives nearby, ran outside after she heard gunshots.

'I was sitting in my bedroom here and heard the shots. "Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam,"' she told Seattle television station KOMO. 'The baby was on the ground, and other people were doing CPR on the baby, and the mother was in hysterics and the dad was in hysterics, too.'

Heart-wrenching: Malaja's relatives, including her aunt (right), were heard sobbing and screaming, including one enraged woman (left) who cried out: 'I want revenge!'

Poignant message: The girl's uncle, Edmond McNeil (pictured), called for end of violence in Seattle 

On Thursday evening, Malaja's heartbroken family said the toddler was brain dead. 

The girl's uncle, Edmond McNeil, came up to a KIRO7 reporter outside the hospital and delivered a powerful message on crime in the city. 

'We need to stop the Seattle violence,' he said into the camera, appearing shell-shocked. 'We're trying to be living for our kids. Everybody needs to live for your kids... You ain't no gangster because you want to carry a gun. That's stupid.'

Malaja's relatives were heard sobbing and screaming, including one enraged woman who cried out: 'I want revenge!'
