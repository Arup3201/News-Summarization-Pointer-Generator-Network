Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, pictured with his family, has caused tension in the Tory party after saying he believes the abortion limit should be halved to 12 weeks

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt was embroiled in a major row last night after controversially backing a reduction in the abortion time limit from 24 weeks to just 12 weeks.

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) described Hunt’s comments as ‘insulting to women’ and said such a policy would cause serious harm.

The Prime Minister and the Department of Health were forced to distance themselves from Mr Hunt’s views – aired just weeks after his appointment in the Cabinet reshuffle – and insisted that there were no plans to change the current policy on abortion.

However, David Cameron indicated that he supported a ‘modest reduction’ in the current limit and Home Secretary Theresa May also revealed her support for the limit to be reduced to 20 weeks.

But last night Mr Cameron said he did not agree with Mr Hunt. ‘He is a Member of Parliament, he is absolutely entitled to hold an individual view, a view of conscience and on this issue all Members of Parliament – Prime Ministers, Health Secretaries, everybody – has to vote according to their consciences,’ he said.

‘But people need to know the Government has got no plans to bring forward any legislation in this area and any vote that does happen will be a free vote.’

Mr Cameron added: ‘I personally have voted for a modest reduction from the current limit of 24 weeks because I think there are some medical arguments for that.’

Mr Hunt was forced to clarify his views yesterday after failing to acknowledge medical abortions, when women choose to end a pregnancy after discovering severe foetal abnormalities.

Various medical conditions are often picked up only at the 12-week or 20-week scans and Mr Hunt’s failure to recognise this led to accusations that he was ‘out of touch’ with women’s health issues.

But a spokeswoman for the Health Secretary said: ‘He is in favour of abortions for medical reasons. So the accusation that a 12-week limit would curtail testing for conditions like Down’s Syndrome is simply not true.

‘He is talking about abortions for social reasons after 12 weeks.’

Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured two years ago with his wife Samantha and their newborn baby daughter Florence, says there are no plans to change the law on abortion

Mr Hunt made his comments in his first major interview since accepting the health brief in July.

He originally voted in favour of halving the termination limit during a Commons vote in 2008 as a member of the Shadow Cabinet.

‘Everyone looks at the evidence and comes to a view about when they think that moment is, and my own view is that 12 weeks is the right point for it,’ he said.

‘It’s just my view about that incredibly difficult question about the moment that we should deem life to start. I don’t think the reason I have that view is for religious reasons.’

Home Secretary Theresa May has also revealed her support to modestly reduce the abortion limit from 24 to 20 weeks

Mr Hunt’s comments were widely condemned.

Yvette Cooper, Shadow Home Secretary and Minister for Women & Equalities, said: ‘Everyone has personal views but as Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt has a responsibility to lead Government policy on women’s health.

‘Perhaps the most chilling part of his interview is the claim that 12 weeks is based on evidence when it undoubtedly is not. David Cameron needs to make sure his Health Secretary doesn’t distort medical evidence and does not impose his own view on women about their health.’

Diane Abbott, Labour’s Shadow Public Health Minister, accused Ministers of ‘playing politics with people’s lives’ and insisted there was no justification for a reduction in the present limit.

Meanwhile, Tory MP Dr Sarah Woollaston tweeted: ‘Profoundly disagree with Hunt on lowering abortion limit; would restrict access to safe abortion for most vulnerable who present late.’

RCOG spokeswoman Dr Kate Guthrie said: ‘The comments made by Jeremy Hunt politicise the debate around the abortion time limit and do not put women at the centre of their care. Reducing the time limit to  12 weeks would severely limit women’s choice at an extremely difficult time in their life.’

According to official figures, there were 189,931 abortions in 2011, only a slight increase since 2010.

More than 90 per cent took place before 13 weeks and just eight per cent were carried out between  12 weeks and 24 weeks.

Of those, 2,307 were carried out because of a risk the child would be born disabled.

Those who argue for a reduction in the limit say there is evidence that a child born at 20 weeks could survive in hospital.
