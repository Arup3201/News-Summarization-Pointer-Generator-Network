Louis van Gaal claims the world is 'twisted' after a video emerged of Wayne Rooney being knocked out by former team-mate Phil Bardsley. 

The Manchester United striker humourlessly celebrated in punch-drunk fashion after scoring during the win against Tottenham on Sunday to combat the story which appeared in The Sun.

But his manager was less than impressed that the video was leaked.

'I think it is a ridiculous world where we live that I have to answer questions (like that),' the Dutchman said.

'What is this world, twisted? I don't want to answer questions about such things.'

Rooney enjoyed his goal celebration but was keen to play down the story and bemoaned the fact it had reached the public domain. 

Bardsley's wife Tanya had also tweeted that the video was a joke between the pair.

For a few seconds, Rooney lay on the Old Trafford pitch with his arms spread wide while being congratulated

'That's the world we live in today. It's in my own home, it's not public, it's what friends do - they mess around in the house,' the United captain told Sky Sports.

'It was a couple of mates in a private house, and somehow it's managed to get on the front page of a national newspaper.'

Rooney took advantage of a misplaced pass by Nabil Bentaleb and bundled his way past two Spurs players before scoring the third and final goal of a hugely successful afternoon for United.

Rooney, 29, insisted the publication of the story did not distract him in the build-up to the game.

He said: 'I've just been focused on the game, it's more interesting for other people rather than for me. You've seen today, I've done a professional job and helped my team win 3-0.'

Midfielder Michael Carrick revealed after the match that he and his team-mates had poked fun at Rooney over the episode.

'He got a little bit of stick,' Carrick said. 'I am not telling you what was said. It's a 'no comment' on that one.'
