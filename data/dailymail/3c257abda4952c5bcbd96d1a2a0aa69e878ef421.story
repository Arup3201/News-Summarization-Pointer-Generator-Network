It was as though ‘Liverpool’ was a banned word. You were exceedingly hard-pressed to find any mention of Bournemouth’s forthcoming Capital One Cup glamour tie at the Goldsands Stadium on Saturday.

There was no excited chatter outside the ground, none of those awful half-and-half scarves on sale. There were no promotional posters anywhere with ‘sold out’ slapped across them and the PA announcer didn’t see fit to mention it until after the final whistle.

The only reference to the biggest game in the club’s recent history came on the tickets page — not that there are any left — and the fixture list. You see, while cup ties like Wednesday’s are a nice distraction, Bournemouth are increasingly of the belief that such fixtures can become commonplace.

With five goals from five different scorers, the Cherries are back on top of the Championship after beating Cardiff in an exhilarating advert for football at this level.

Brendan Rodgers and Liverpool, you have been warned. This may be an excursion to the seaside but it’ll be far from pleasurable.

‘We can’t show them too much respect,’ said Bournemouth’s star striker Callum Wilson, who has now scored 12 goals this season, including the winner against West Brom in the last round.

‘They are a Premier League team but we want to beat them. We’re not going to set up at home to protect a 0-0, we want to score goals and show them what we’re about, how we play.’

Wilson, who ironically was recommended to manager Eddie Howe by Cardiff boss Russell Slade, scored in the 89th minute to finally kill off the Welsh side’s spirited challenge and send his team top on goal difference.

It is Bournemouth’s 12th match without defeat in all competitions and Wilson’s form is just scratching the surface of the attacking threat Liverpool will have to deal with. The Cherries are the leading scorers in the top four divisions with 44 in 21 games and are ready to expose the Reds’ often fragile defence.

Saturday’s outstanding performer was Matt Ritchie, who got the ball rolling after just 38 seconds, with further goals coming from Harry Arter, Marc Pugh and Yann Kermorgant before Wilson rounded it off.

They were stylish finishes too — Arter started and finished the move that led to his goal, Pugh produced a superb curling shot and Kermorgant bent home a lovely free-kick.

‘The way we’re playing you’re going to get the chances,’ said Wilson, the 22-year-old who joined for £3million from Coventry last summer, of the team’s attacking approach.

‘The team’s not just relying on the strikers. Five different goalscorers today shows that we’re getting goals from different positions.’

Howe was suffering from flu so delegated post-match media duties to assistant Jason Tindall but he’ll certainly feel perkier following this result as he prepares to go head-to-head with friend and mentor Rodgers.

For Cardiff, it was a disappointing and disorienting afternoon. Disappointing in that they scored three goals away from home and lost. Disorienting in that they took to the field in all-white to a predictable reaction.

‘Why the f*** are we in white?’ and ‘Are we Swansea in disguise?’ sang the travelling support for most of the first half while waving anything blue above their heads, drawing sympathetic applause from the home fans.

As if Vincent Tan’s decision to change their principal colours to red isn’t bad enough, he’s dressed them like bitter rivals Swansea on the road too.

‘This is a yardstick,’ said Slade. ‘Eddie’s done a wonderful job here. We need to work harder to get to their level.’

An eight-goal thriller — and the week’s main attraction is still to come.

PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND

Birmingham’s renaissance under Gary Rowett continued as they thrashed Reading 6-1 at St Andrew’s. City have lost one in seven since Rowett joined from Burton and have now hit the relative heights of 15th. 

Demarai Gray, 18, scored a first career hat-trick before half-time and Rowett said: ‘We toyed with him this week about how many goals he’s scored. He said “one” and you could see a look of disgust with himself.’
