Shocking footage has emerged appearing to show a Libyan fighter jet  spinning out of control and plunging into a residential area on the ground below.

The fiery crash is believed to have claimed the lives of three people and injured another nine in Tobruk, a city on on Libya's Mediterranean coast, about an hour's flight from the capital of Tripoli.

The video, filmed by a frightened onlooker, shows the plane swooping low over the surrounding buildings before it starts rolling in the air.

Shocking footage shows a Libyan fighter plane crashing into a  residential area of Tobruk

The aircraft then nose-dives into a building and causes a fiery explosion, which cloaks the area in a thick black smoke. The pilot and two residents were killed.

The ABC reports Libya's new parliamentary offices are less than one kilometre from where the plane went down and the crash happened in the centre of a heavily populated residential area.

The plane was part of Libya's ageing airforce and the tragic accident unfolded during an event to honour a pilot killed in another aircraft crash.

Last week a pilot was killed in the eastern city of Bayda in the restive North African nation and the military event was being held to commemorate him.

On Tuesday, not long before the crash took place, a British envoy visited the Libyan parliament in a show of solidarity against the forces which claimed the city of Tripoli last month.

This comes as US officials warn Islamic militants may have stolen nearly a dozen Libyan commercial planes in preparation for potential terrorist attacks in the region.

A fiery explosion followed which lit up the sky and clouded the area in a thick black smoke

It took place less than a kilometre from parliament and was during a military event held in honour of a soldier killed the week before

Eleven commercial jets operated by two state-owned airlines went missing last month, after militant group Libyan Dawn overtook the international airport in the capital city of Tripoli.

On Sunday, the Libyan government announced that they had lost control of the capital to competing militias including the radical Islamic groups Ansar al Sharia and Libyan Dawn.

Ansar al Sharia has ties to the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), the Syrian group which today released the filmed beheaded American journalist Steven Sotloff in the second recorded execution of a U.S. hostage.
