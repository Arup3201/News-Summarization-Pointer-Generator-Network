A lawsuit filed by two massage therapists alleging that former NFL star Brett Favre caused the women to lose their jobs with the New York Jets - as the result of the former gridiron great's sending the women racy text messages - has reportedly been settled.

Lawyer David Jaroslawicz wouldn't comment on the terms of the settlement, saying only that the case had been "resolved and discontinued."

The two women who filed the lawsuit against Favre, Christina Scavo and Shannon O'Toole, claimed that in 2008 they lost their jobs with the team when Favre sent sexually suggestive text messages to another therapist.Â 

It's settled: a lawsuit alleging NFL star Brett Favre sent several women racy text messages has been settled for an undisclosed amount of money

According to the women, the three-time NFL MVP asked the woman if he could get 
together with her and Scavo, followed by another text saying, "I guess I
have bad intentions."

After Scavo's husband asked Favre to apologize, she and O'Toole lost their jobs with the Jets, the lawsuit said.

A lawyer for Favre didn't immediately respond to a call for comment 
Friday but has denied the allegations in the past, arguing in court 
papers that if the therapists lost work Favre wasn't responsible for it.

comment Friday.

'Sext'-y: Favre also is alleged to have sent racy text messages to former New York Jets sideline reporter Jenn Sterger (pictured), as well as allegedly sending her photos of his penis that ended up on the sports website DeadspinThe therapists' lawsuit was filed five days after the NFL fined Favre $50,000 for not being forthright in an investigation into allegations that he sent bawdy text messages - and allegedly a photo of his penis that ended up on the sports website Deadspin - to former Jets game hostess Jenn Sterger when they both worked for the team. During that investigation, media reports claimed Favre also had pursued massage therapists, but the NFL said it was unable to get enough information to decide whether the reports were substantiated.The Jets have said O'Toole and Scavo worked for the team for a combined total of five days over two years, making $2,300 in all, and were never guaranteed ongoing work. The team wasn't told about the women's concerns and simply turned to other massage therapists after its training facility moved in 2008, its officials and lawyers have said in court filings.Favre retired from the NFL in 2010, after playing for 20 seasons, mostly with the Green Bay Packers. He began his career with the Atlanta Falcons and ended it with the Minnesota Vikings.
