Temperatures surged towards 26C this afternoon as Britain basked in the September heatwave - just hours after downpours lashed the South Coast.

The mercury went way above the month's average of 16.5C as it was revealed the country is enjoying its driest September in more than half a century.

But the glorious conditions are likely to be short lived with forecasters issuing a weather warning for rain tomorrow. Huge thunderstorms are expected to move in across southern and western parts of the country overnight and into tomorrow.

Fierce thunderstorms and lightning have already been reported along the South Coast today - and tomorrow more than a week's worth of rain is expected to fall in just a few hours in some parts.

'This is already becoming increasingly unstable and producing a few thunderstorms through Thursday, but these are expected to become more widespread overnight into Friday and extend further north into the Midlands and Wales. 

'Many place will miss the worst of these - some may stay dry - but where they do occur, 20-30 mm rain may fall in a short time, leading to some surface water flooding, whilst lightning and hail may be additional hazards.' 

The weather warning has been issued for  Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall.

Cities and towns named in the yellow alert include Bath, Bournemouth, Bristol, Poole, Torbay and Plymouth. 

Meanwhile, heavy fog in the Western Isles threatened to disrupt tonight’s count in Scotland’s historic independence referendum. 

Many postal votes are presently stuck on the mainland this morning because the mail plane cannot get through.

The Western Isles was in the running to be the first of 32 regions in Scotland to declare the local result, looking at a 1.30am announcement

But the blanket of fog lying over the islands has put well organised plans to use a charted plane to fly ballot boxes from Uist and Barra to the count centre in Stornoway.

Ferries and boats will be put on stand-by today as it would too hazardous for aircraft to fly in such poor visibility.

Average September conditions are set to return next week, but the Met Office said last night that the first half of September had been the UK’s driest since 1960.

Official figures show there has been just a quarter of an inch (6.7mm) of rain on average across the UK between September 1 and 15. 

This is seven per cent of the month’s average of 3.8 inches (96mm). 

Daytime temperatures have been particularly high, with an average of 18.4C (65F) – 1.9C above usual. 

Night-time minimums have been closer to average at 9.6C (49F) – 0.7C above average. 

There has also been slightly more sunshine than normal for September so far – 70.8 hours, which is about 57 per cent of the full-month average.

The figures come after a prolonged spell of fine, settled weather, dominated by high pressure sitting over the country. 

This has blocked the usual-low pressure systems that move in from the west and bring unsettled conditions.

Nicky Maxey, of the Met Office, said: ‘Temperatures in parts could be about 10C above average for September, and it will feel warm overnight before cooling down a bit by Sunday.

The fine weather has led to near-perfect growing conditions for British vineyards, which are enjoying a better year than their French and Italian rivals and are expecting a record harvest in quality as well as quantity.

Meanwhile, wine producers in southern Italy are braced for a 30 per cent drop in their harvest after the country endured a cool, rainy summer.

French winemakers have already declared their season a catastrophe after hail storms wiped out 80 per cent of Pinot noir and Chardonnay crops in Burgundy.

But with the continuing fine weather here, British growers predict a final boost for crops before next month’s harvest.

Frazer Thompson, of Chapel Down Winery in Kent, said growers were hoping for ‘a true vintage year in English wine’.
