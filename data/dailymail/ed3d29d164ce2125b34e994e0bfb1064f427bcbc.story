From life-size teddy bears to life-like arms covered in creepy tattoos - it seems there's no item too weird to be couriered across the world.

Starting in Australia and winding their way across the country - and even overseas - here's some of the strangest items which have been packed and posted in 2014.

There's the plain ridiculous, from a 19th century water tank or oddly-designed cakes, to the surprise a girl had planned for her parents when she packaged herself in a box and leapt out of it after returning from a holiday. She even paid for the experience herself.

An oversized bear and a girl who sprung out of a box to surprise her parents were two of the wackiest items sent this year

A life-like arm covered in tattoos is one of the more creepy packages

An enormous wooden bath was delivered to The Block home of Shannon and Simon Voss from Pack and Send

Pack and Send CEO Michael Paul said people will go to any lengths to send their loved ones or relatives gifts that they'll get a kick out of.

'This is the kind of thing we like celebrating each year on World Post Day, the weird list of items that people have packaged and sent away through the year.'

World Post Day is universally recognised and acknowledged by every member of the Universal Postal Union - including Australian company Pack and Send.

'It's celebrated all around the world to raise awareness about the role the post an parcels play in business and peoples' lives.' 

Pack and Send franchise owner Scott Curr said the

1. A wooden bath - sent to The Block home of Shannon and Simon Voss from the Channel Nine program 

2. A replica model ship delivered to the life- size ship 

3.  A retro shell petrol pump

4. A life like replica of a tattooed arm

5. Two giant goannas 

6. A girl (who jumped from a box to surprise her parents

7. A Furphy Tank - it was used in the 1800s to carry water.

8. The Brisbane International Tennis Trophy

9. Crazy novelty cakes

10. A Harp 

biggest thing he has ever shipped 'was a truck with a drilling rig' to Papua New Guinea which cost the sender upwards of $15,000.

A few of the more  unusual items also include the head of a moose, and a package of 1940s mannequin sent to an avid Newcastle collector.

He said the moose head had antlers 'one and a half metres wide.' 'I don't know if you've ever seen one before but they're a hell of a lot bigger than you'd think' he said.

His franchise has also sent and received a trophy with the names of tennis stars Lleyton Hewitt and Serena Williams engraved on it for The Brisbane International tennis tournament.

'It gets sent down to Melbourne for repairs and to have the names of new winners engraved on it after each tournament.'

Mr Paul said with the advent of  online shopping and its increased use, his company is sending more items across the world than ever before.

'The landscape in terms of sending parcels in the e-commerce industry is improving,' he said.

'There are more parcels being sent than ever before as a result of more things being bought online.' 

Two giant goannas are just some of the wacky items sent in 2014

His company uses a  national  network of some 30 clients who provide most of the heavy lifting.

'We are a one-stop shop solution for people opting to send  anything, anywhere.' 'There is no weight or size restrictions.'

'We are a bit like a  travel agency, like a flight centre, he said. 'We use the service of other carriers to do the deliveries.' 

This 1800s water vessel is an example of the strange items couriered by the Australian shipping company

The Brisbane International Tennis trophy is sent to Melbourne each year for fresh engravings and repairs

A oddly designed cake and a replica, miniature ship transferred on to a larger vessel to be delivered to its destination

Another car-shaped cake was on the list of weird items 

How is this for a kooky cake?!  It was also delivered during the last twelve months
