An Iowa man is lucky to be alive after jumping into the frigid waters of the Des Moines River on Monday and reportedly fighting off the help of rescuers attempting to save him.

The incident occurred on the east side of the river near 6th Avenue across from North High School around 1.30 pm.

Witnesses they say they saw the man - who has not been identified - jump into the iced-over river.

Footage from the scene shows him lying on his back floating in the freezing water, according to KCCI 8.

Bizarre: Witnesses say this man freely jumped into the iced-over Des Moines River in Iowa on Monday

Help: Rescue crews used a special lightweight boat to get out across the thin ice to help the man

Dramatic: At one point the rescue worker fell through the ice into the water

Safe: The crew members had the man grab onto the boat, which was then pulled into shore

Freezing: Authorities say they got the call about the man around 1:30 p.m. and witnesses told officials they saw him jump into the water

When water rescue crews arrived they called out to the man, telling him to swim ashore.

However they say he swam away from them and clung to a piece of ice.

The crews were then forced to enter the water and get the man out.

They used a special lightweight boat to move across the thin ice.

The air temperature was 14 degrees and at one point a crew member fell through the ice trying to reach the man.

'Fortunately he didn't get under the ice. But as you saw the challenge of the thickness ... it wouldn't support our body's weight so that's why we brought that new rescue boat that we have that allows us to slide it across ice,' Brian O'Keefe from the Des Moines Fire Department told KCCI 8.

Team work: A group of rescue workers help each other pull in the boat using a rope

Almost there: The Des Moines Fire Department lead the rescue on Monday

Within 15 minutes the man was safe at shore.

He was transported to hospital.

It is not known why he jumped in the water or displayed such bizarre behavior. 

Rescuers said hypothermia can make people act strangely.
