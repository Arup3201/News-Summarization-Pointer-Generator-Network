These terrifying pictures show children as young as five being trained to kill with pistols and deadly AK-47 assault rifles.

They were taken from footage of an al Qaeda terror camp in north Waziristan, near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.

Many of the children are orphans of the terrorist organisation's 'martyrs' following the same deadly route as their fathers.

They are brainwashed into waging Jihad on the West and becoming suicide bombers, the Sunday Mirror reported.

It was posted on an underground al Qaeda website and issued by the Turkistan Islamic Party, which trains fighters to fight alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan.

It is believed the armed group is responsible for more than 200 acts of ­terrorism worldwide in the past 20 years, the paper reported.

Terrorism expert Neil Doyle said: 'The video is part of disturbing trend.

'This is the fourth Islamist insurgent group in recent weeks that has been linked to training children for the battlefield.

'Groups in Syria and ­Somalia have also claimed to be coaching children.

'These children are living a very bleak existence. There is growing evidence that many are forced into it.'

The Pakistani Taliban is one of many loosely allied extremist groups that operate in Pakistan's tribal region.

It wants to impose the same kind of hardline interpretation of Islamic law as the Afghan Taliban that ruled Afghanistan until the 2001 U.S.-led invasion ousted the hardline regime for sheltering al Qaeda's leaders.

The militant hideouts along the 
Afghan-Pakistan border have long been a source of tension for Kabul, 
Islamabad and the international coalition.

Pakistan wants NATO and Afghan forces to crack down on Pakistani militants launching attacks from hideouts on the Afghan side of the border.

Meanwhile, American military commanders have been pressuring Islamabad to launch military strikes on terrorists in North Waziristan.
