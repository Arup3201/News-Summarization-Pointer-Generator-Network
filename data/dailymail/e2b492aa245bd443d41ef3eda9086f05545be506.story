Irina Shayk was not on hand to see her partner Cristiano Ronaldo collect his third Ballon d'Or in Zurich on Monday - causing an eruption of rumours that the couple had split up.

The flames were fanned when it was highlighted that Shayk was not following Ronaldo on Twitter, with some saying she had 'unfollowed' him.

Shayk's PR company have finally responded to the claims and explained that her absence was due to work commitments.

Shayk was swamped with queries on Instagram about a split and her last post was four days ago during a holiday in the Maldives

Her New York based representatives told Goal.com that the Ballon d'Or 'didn't fit in with her schedule - it (her absence) was because of work commitments. We have no further comment to make.'

Shayk's Instagram page has been inundated with questions from fans of the couple asking if they have parted.

But she has remained silent, and her last post came four days ago during a holiday in the Maldives.
