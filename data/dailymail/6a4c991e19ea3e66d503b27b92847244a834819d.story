She was the daughter of a Suffolk rector but the young Flora Sandes used to dream of being a soldier, spending her childhood galloping through the countryside while pretending she was fighting in battle.

Twenty years later, when war broke out for real across Europe, the adult Flora enlisted for the army in Serbia, one of the allied countries, and in the process, became the only British woman to see front line action.

Now Flora's amazing story is to be told in a BBC radio documentary on BBC Radio Suffolk tonight as part of its WWI at Home series.

She lived an extraordinary life, even by today's standards; battling against the odds to achieve her dream of fighting as an equal alongside men.

And it wasn't just the art of 'soldiering on' in which she saw herself as an equal to her male companions: Drinking, smoking, racing cars and shooting - all still very much masculine pursuits were considered fair game to Flora.

Surprisingly her background would not have suggested such maverick spirit. Born in 1876 in North Yorkshire, Flora was the youngest of eight children. The family, headed by her rector father Samuel Sandes, moved to Suffolk when she was nine years old.

She had a typically middle-class childhood that included a governess and stint at finishing school, but rather than dreaming of steady life with a husband and children, Flora always yearned for adventure.

According to Louise Millar, Flora's biographer: 'Women in those days were supposed to lead lives of demure respectablity which included tea parties and playing tennis. It could be very dull, particularly for someone like Flora who was a tomboy.'

Flora loved being in the army, saying 'I never loved anything so much in my entire life.' This photograph was taken in Montenegro in 1919

After training as a stenographer in 
London, Flora used her wages and a legacy from a rich uncle and headed off
 to explore the world.

She 
worked as a secretary in Cairo, camped in British Columbia in Canada and, even, while working her way across America, shot a man in self-defence.

Flora
 was 38 years old when Britain declared war on Germany in 1914, living in London 
with her 15-year-old nephew Dick and her elderly father.

She signed up to be a volunteer with the ambulance service and within eight days was on her way to Serbia with the first volunteer unit to leave Britain.

At first, she worked with the Red Cross but soon enlisted in the Serbian army - one of the few in the world to accept women.

She soon moved up the ranks, becoming corporal and then sergeant-major, and didn't shy away from the action. While engaged in hand-to-hand fighting, Flora was wounded by a grenade while helping to defend her position.

She was rescued by a lieutenant in her company who risked his life to crawl out under fire to drag her back to safety.

For her exceptional bravery under fire, she was awarded a medal and made headlines around the world, but it had come at a price - shrapnel had shredded the flesh of her back and the right side of her body from shoulder to knee. Her right arm had been broken and badly lacerated.

Once recovered, she rejoined the men in the frontline trenches, fought alongside them as they regained the country they had lost nearly three years before, and survived Spanish influenza.

Says Millar: 'They called her a 'brother', as as an honorary man. She
 was a good soldier, starting the war as a private and had made sergeant-major by 
end of war.'

She adds: 'Serbia was the only country that allowed women to do anything 
they wanted During the war they had more freedom than anywhere else partly because the Serbians didn't know what to make of these women and their need was so desperate.'

When the war ended she remained in the army, saying: 'I never loved anything so much in my life.'

But in 1922 when she was demobilised, Flora found it hard to readjust. ‘I felt neither fish nor flesh when I came out of the army,’ she said. ‘The first time I put on women’s clothes, I slunk through the streets.’

She drifted between England and Serbia for several years but then found love in the shape of Yuri Yudenitch, a handsome, educated 'White Russian officer', 12 years her junior, who had served as one of her sergeants.

The Serbian army was one of the few to accept women and Flora felt at home with the other soldiers

They married in 1927. Two years later, they moved to the new kingdom of Yugoslavia and there they stayed.

But with tensions once more brewing, neither were to enjoy a peaceful life. The Nazis invaded in April 1941 and four days later, aged 65, Flora pulled on her uniform and marched off to fight.

Within days, though, her old war wound put an end to her plans. It took only 11 days for the Germans to defeat the Yugoslav army and occupy the country.

Flora was imprisioned by the Gestapo - the German political police - and was freed after a week, but had to report to a Gestapo officer every week. Sadly her beloved husband died of heart failure in 1941.

After the war Flora was left alone and penniless. However undeterred she moved to stay with her nephew first in Jerusalem and then Rhodesia - now Zimbabwe - where at the age of 70 she raised local hackles by drinking and smoking with the black peasant population.

Always a maverick: even before WWI Flora was raising eyebrows with her unconventional behaviour

She finally returned to Suffolk and took to using an electric wheelchair to travel between the local villages. She would set off, white hair streaming behind her, as she pushed it to its full speed.

Increasingly nostalgic for the war, she lived for the annual gathering of the Salonika Reunion Association, for whom she was a heroine.

After a brief illness, she died at Ipswich and East Suffolk Hospital on 24 November 1956 of ‘obstructive jaundice’, aged 80. She had renewed her passport shortly before she died, still dreaming of places to see and trips to take.

According to her biographer Louise Millar, Flora was even more modern than women are 
today in a sense. 'She let nothing hold her back. She did what she wanted
 to do and she
 was proof that women could do whatever they wanted.

'I think she helped 
shift the perception of what women could do. She was a heroine. She really pushed the boundaries.'

A documentary on Flora Sandes will be aired on BBC Radio Suffolk today as part of the BBC’s World War One At Home series.
