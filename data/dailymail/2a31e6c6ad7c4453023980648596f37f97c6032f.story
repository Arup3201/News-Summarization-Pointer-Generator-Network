Disgraced: Major Armstrong has been stripped of his Military Cross after it was revealed he helped to write his own citation

An officer who was awarded one of Britain’s most coveted gallantry medals for his bravery in Afghanistan has been stripped of it after he exaggerated his heroism.

It is the first time the Queen has rescinded a gallantry medal issued to a serviceman and the case could undermine confidence in the awards system in the armed forces.

Major Robert Michael Armstrong had been accused of taking credit for others’ bravery after Taliban gunmen ambushed a convoy in Helmand in 2008.

Armstrong was awarded the Military Cross for dodging bullets and inspiring Afghan troops to fire rockets at the enemy.

But a five-year investigation by defence chiefs concluded he helped to write the medal citation.

As a result, the medal will be withdrawn in a decision due to be announced by the London Gazette – the journal which publishes official notices. 

Former Army Major Charles Heyman told the Mail: ‘It raises questions on the whole awards process.

‘It is good to hear that the Army has come clean and withdrawn his award. Nothing annoys a soldier more than people getting awards that they are not entitled to.’

Armstrong, through his lawyers, said he had had ‘no role in corroborating events referred to in the citation’ and said there were ‘shortcomings and irregularities’ in the process used by senior officers. 

He also said a report had found there had been ‘no attempt’ to check the facts with any of the Afghan National Army personnel.

Gallantry awards are subject to several checks. When a soldier performs an act of bravery on operations, the most superior officer present normally drafts a citation.

He or she would speak to all of those present at the action, and they may even speak to the subject themselves to ask what they did – without letting them know they are writing a citation.

According to a guide on Honours and Awards in the armed forces, the subject of a citation should not know their name has been put forward. 

Under no circumstance should they have any part in writing their own citation. The ‘theatre’ commander in charge then assesses citations.

The Chief of Joint Operations has his say, followed by the Ministry of Defence’s Armed Forces Operational Awards Committee. 

Their findings are then looked at by the Services Honours Committee and submitted by the Defence Secretary to the Queen.

Last night a defence source told the Mail: ‘Everyone in the Army, especially all those who have been awarded gallantry medals for selfless acts of bravery, will appreciate this robust action. 

'The threshold for British gallantry awards is exceptionally high and this announcement ensures their achievements are not undermined.’

In 2008, Armstrong, 41, was a Royal Artillery officer attached to the 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment battle group in Helmand. 

A mixed British and Afghan convoy came under attack from the Taliban, allegedly with roadside bombs, rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns.

His citation praised his ‘swift, instinctive actions, personal courage and disregard for his own life’, and stated: ‘As a result of his calm leadership under fire losses were prevented and the lives of those injured were saved.’

He was awarded the Military Cross in 2009 ‘for his consistent bravery and inspirational leadership’.

Dismissed: Major Armstrong arrives at his court martial in 2012 where he admitted four charges of conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline

But upon announcement of the award in spring 2009, it is understood fellow soldiers in the ambush disputed the claims. 

Two corporals were reported to have claimed there was no hostile fire by the Taliban when a vehicle in their convoy was blown up.

The Sunday Telegraph reported at the time that the officer who made the initial complaint felt aggrieved that actions attributed to Major Armstrong were those of other officers.

A junior officer lodged a formal complaint and Army chiefs then called in the Special Investigation Branch of the Royal Military Police.

Separately, the commander of Britain’s 16 Air Assault Brigade, Brigadier Giles Hill, was ordered to carry out a review into the citation. It is understood that he described the Royal Irish Regiment’s performance in handling citations as ‘dysfunctional’.

He found significant disparities between what Armstrong claimed had happened and what actually occurred and that the citation contained a number of falsehoods.

Lieutenant Colonel Ed Freely, commanding officer of the Royal Irish Battle Group, was arrested and interviewed over claims he had failed to check facts in Major Armstrong’s citation. 

By this time Major Armstrong had been posted to Northern Ireland headquarters in Lisburn, Co Antrim. It was there, two months after the announcement of his award, that he was arrested.

When the Military Police examined his personal computer – to see if he had indeed written himself up for the MC – they found instead that he had illegally stored almost 160 classified documents. 

A search of his quarters uncovered an inoperative automatic pistol, more than 270 rounds of ammunition and a morphine injector.

In February 2012 he appeared before a court martial in Colchester, Essex, and admitted four charges of conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline. He was dismissed and handed a year’s imprisonment suspended for two years.

Brigadier Hill’s report, and that of the Special Investigation Branch, was sent through the chain of command to the Armed Forces Operational Awards Committee. 

The committee is chaired by the Defence Services Secretary, Rear Admiral Simon Williams, who is responsible for liaison between the Queen and the forces. 

He briefed her Majesty on the recommendation and the Queen signed the rescinding order.

Armstrong is believed to have declined to appeal and offered to voluntarily decline the award, provided there was no publicity.

The MoD said it could ‘confirm that an investigation has concluded into the circumstances surrounding the award of a gallantry medal relating to an incident in Afghanistan.’
