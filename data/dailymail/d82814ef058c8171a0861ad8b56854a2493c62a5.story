She struck up a friendship with Dennis and Daniel Mahon by displaying the Confederate flag, dressing in tank tops and shorts and sending racy photos, according to court records.

Little did the Mahons know, Rebecca Williams - an attractive woman 20 years their junior - was working as a federal informant.

Four years later, in June 2009, the white supremacist brothers from Illinois were charged in a 2004 bombing that injured a black city official in Scottsdale, Arizona.

Today, the trial for the twin 61-year-olds - delayed several times because of the extensive amount of evidence in their case - was underway.

On trial: Twins Daniel and Dennis Mahon were arrested in June 2009 after a five-year undercover operation

It started in February 26, 2004. A 
bombing in which a package detonated in the hands of Don Logan, 
Scottsdale's diversity director at the time. The package injured Logan's
hand and arm and hurt a secretary.

The brothers have pleaded not guilty in the case.

Scottsdale police immediately called 
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for assistance. 
But with limited access to the brothers, Williams was put on the case.

As TPM Muckraker reports, federal 
court records say little about Williams' background, a civilain with no 
apparent professional training.

In a hearing in September 2010 in federal court in Phoenix, she said she was hired 'just to get information.'

She was placed with an undercover 
female ATF agent in a trailer near the Mahons at a Catoosa, Oklahoma 
trailer park - littered with cameras and microphones that would 
eventually capture the Mahons' apparent confessions.

On the move: The Mahon brothers were living in Tempe in the months before the 2004 bombing, but moved to Catoosa, where the Feds sent their informant

Court records say the plan worked, and
that the Mahons came over as Williams was displaying a Confederate flag
in front of her trailer.

Documents suggest Dennis Mahon opened 
up to her, showed her how to make bombs and bragged about bombing a 
Jewish community centre, an Internal Revenue Service building, an 
immigration facility, and an abortion clinic. Those claims have not been
corroborated.

He also talked to her about the 
Scottsdale bombing, telling her that he didn't do it but convinced white
police officers to do it.

While discussing the Scottsdale 
bombing, court records indicate that Dennis Mahon said: 'I just wanted 
to teach (Logan) a lesson the first time.'

Dennis Mahon also is accused of making
a call to the diversity office in September 2003 and saying, 'the white
Aryan resistance is growing in Scottsdale. There's a few white people 
who are standing up.'

Mahon's defence attorney, Milagros 
Cisneros, argued that Mahon 'often makes exaggerated self-aggrandizing 
claims' that aren't true, that he was an alcoholic who constantly was 
drinking Everclear, and that his statements to Williams were just meant 
to impress her.

She and the other defence attorneys in
the case tried to get some of the charges thrown out based on what they
argued was 'outrageous government conduct' in the case that amounted to
entrapment and coercion.

Williams also gave the Mahons at least
two racy photos - one that showed her in a leather jacket, fishnet 
stockings and a thong that completely exposed her buttocks, along with a
note that said, 'Thought you'd love the butt shot.' The other showed 
her in a revealing white bikini top with a grenade hanging between her 
breasts as Williams posed in front of a pickup truck and a swastika.

'This individual represents hate, and 
that hate is a danger to the community. That someone would come to Arizona and launch 
an attack simply because my skin colour is different from theirs, simply
because of hate... is unconscionable.'

- Don Logan

Prosecutors pointed out that Williams never kissed or had sex with either brother.

Campbell agreed with the prosecution 
in an October 2010 ruling, saying that although Dennis Mahon 'developed a
strong physical and emotional attraction to her,' their relationship 
did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation that warranted 
dismissing charges.

In a letter filed as evidence in 
federal court, Dennis Mahon wrote that he led the White Knights of the 
Ku Klux Klan from 1987 to 1991 and that brother Daniel was never a 
member of the group, only a 'small money supporter.'

In a 2007 interview with a National 
Geographic reporter, Dennis Mahon expressed his anti-government views, 
saying that 'it's going to take violence' and praising Oklahoma City 
bomber Tim McVeigh.

'They (the government) only understand
the rich and the powerful, but they also understand Tim McVeigh and 
guys that know how to be violent in the right way to get the job done,' 
he said.

He also said violence was a way to get
the attention of whites, warning that Mexicans were taking over the 
Southwest and black people were taking over the South.

Authorities said they found assault 
weapons, hundreds of rounds of ammunition and white supremacist material
in the Mahons' home when they were arrested.

Logan has denied requests to speak about the case but spoke in court during a hearing for Daniel Mahon shortly after his arrest.

'This individual represents hate, and 
that hate is a danger to the community,' Logan said as he pointedly 
looked Mahon in the eye. 'That someone would come to Arizona and launch 
an attack simply because my skin colour is different from theirs, simply
because of hate... is unconscionable.'

The Mahons are charged with conspiracy
to damage buildings and property by means of explosive, and Dennis 
Mahon also is charged with malicious damage of a building by means of 
explosive and distribution of information related to explosives.

Judge David Campbell ordered the case 
to proceed today over the objection of defence attorneys who said they 
needed another week to prepare. The Mahons, dressed in suits, sat 
quietly as U.S. Marshals stood close by.

Jury selection is expected to take 
through Wednesday. Opening statements are scheduled for Thursday 
morning, and the trial is expected to last about two months.
