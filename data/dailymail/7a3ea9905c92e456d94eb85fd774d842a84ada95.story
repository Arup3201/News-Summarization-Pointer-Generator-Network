Chelsea's new signing arrives from Croatia after receiving rave reviews for his performances with Hajduk Split. With Liverpool and Tottenham also showing an interest Jose Mourinho's side managed to nip in and sign the midfield protegee for just £3million. Here, LAURIE WHITWELL explains what all the fuss is about.

So who is this guy I'm hearing whispers about?

Name: Mario Pasalic

Club: Chelsea

Age: 19

Position: Central midfield

Arrival: Chelsea's new signing Mario Pasalic holds his blue shirt aloft at the club's training ground in Cobham

I’m going to need more than that...

Pasalic has played for Hajduk Split since the age of 10 and progressed through the ranks, enjoying his most productive campaign last season by scoring 11 goals in the Croatian top tier.

He has appeared for the Under-21 national side and was included in the 30-man senior squad for the World Cup in Brazil before the numbers were trimmed by manager Niko Kovac. 

So why all the fuss?

Chelsea technical director Michael Emenalo watched when Pasalic scored the only goal for Hajduk, as they beat city rivals RNK 1-0 and Jose Mourinho has sanctioned the move.

Last September he scored both goals as Hajduk beat rivals Dinamo Zagreb 2-0 and was a key figure in his side finishing third in the table.

Talent: Pasalic has played for Croatia Under 21s and was named in the provisional 30-man World Cup squad

What’s his style?

Pasalic is a box-to-box midfielder, starting deeper but able to roam and provide a real goal threat.

Defensive duties are not neglected however. He is a good passer and likes shooting from range.

So, a bit like?

He has been compared to Luka Modric on occasions because of his nationality and vision but at 6ft 1in is taller, reminding some of former Chelsea player Michael Ballack

By his own words, a bona fide Blues legend is an inspiration. ‘My favourite player is Frank Lampard,’ he says.

How much is he worth and what happens next?

Chelsea have paid £3million for his services amid interest from Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur. With more first-team football and international honours that figure could soon rise.

How will he fit in?

It is highly likely Pasalic will go on loan to a team on the continent to continue his development before returning to Stamford Bridge next summer.

Ultimately, he would play in a midfield duo behind three more advanced players – such as Oscar, Eden Hazard, and Andre Shurrle – but possesses enough versatility to move upfield too.

Everyone has a weakness...

Not a weakness on the pitch as such, but in 2012 he missed half a season after being diagnosed with a Staphylococcus infection, which can result in boils or abscesses.

He recuperated after treatement and a lengthy spell on the sidelines.

What happens next?

Pasalic has joined in first-team training at Chelsea’s Cobham base but is likely to go on loan, possibly in the next fortnight to a team such as Lazio or Eintracht Frankfurt, who have registered prior interest.

‘Mario has grown at Hajduk,’ said Emanelo after his scouting trip. ‘In the summer he has to go to a club where he will continue to evolve in order to one day play at Stamford Bridge.’

In April his agent, Ivica Loncar, said there were, ‘several interested clubs from Italy, Germany and Spain, and it is possible that the first two weeks of preparation activity will be with Chelsea. But the decision is Jose Mourinho’s.’

Anything else I need to know?

Despite playing for Croatia at numerous age groups, Pasalic was actually born in Mainz, Germany.
