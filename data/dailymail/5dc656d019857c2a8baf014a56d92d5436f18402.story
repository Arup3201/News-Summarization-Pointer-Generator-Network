A partnership that had helped fashion British sporting history came to an end on a chilly November day at Andy Murray’s house in Surrey.

Dani Vallverdu had gone for a chat with the friend he met as a young teenager at Barcelona tennis academy and whom he assisted to the US Open, Olympic and Wimbledon titles. Five years of living out of each other’s pockets was over.

‘We sat and talked for a few hours and that was it, a calm conversation,’ said Vallverdu, speaking for the first time about his exit from Team Murray following the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals.

‘Our professional relationship had run its course. Maybe it had become a bit stale. I thought it was the right time to part. There are no hard feelings but now I have to focus on my career, trying to help Tomas Berdych achieve his goals.’

Vallverdu’s new charge, the world No 7, was in Australian Open action  against Serbia’s Viktor Troicki, while Murray faced Joao Sousa of Portugal.

‘Andy and I have been friends for nearly 15 years,’ continued Vallverdu. ‘Our personal relationship is still good, I consider him one of my best friends and I’ll always be in his corner, except for when I am coaching against him.’

Vallverdu, part of a hugely successful coaching duo with Ivan Lendl, scotches suggestions he and Murray had a big fall-out and that he did not get on with Amelie Mauresmo. He predicts the Scot will win more Grand Slams.

If there is a source of contention it is Murray’s pointed, recently repeated assertions that his team were not all ‘pulling in the same direction’ in the last few months.

There certainly seem to have been technical disagreements about the type of fitness regimes favoured by trainer Jez Green, who also left in November, but it is news to Vallverdu that there was a split in the camp.

‘We were all pulling in the same direction,’ he says. ‘I’m quite proud of how we pulled it around after the US Open. It was pretty hard, him qualifying for London from his position after New York. Of course Andy is the one who played the matches but everyone had the goal of helping him get there. I don’t think the last four months are a reason we aren’t working together any more, it was genuinely mutual.

‘His determination, professionalism and stubbornness, that’s what has made him so successful but, because of the way he is, it gets to the point when it is time for both parties to go their own ways.’

Few know Murray better than Vallverdu, a soft-spoken Venezuelan who smilingly describes himself as ‘28, but with an old soul’. He worked with Murray from early 2010, travelling non-stop and becoming the perfect foil for the uncompromising Lendl, who rarely wasted a chance to extol the South American’s understated contribution.

There was undoubtedly some hurt when Murray sought Mauresmo’s services at the French Open without telling his inner circle first, but Vallverdu flattens widely-held assertions that he could not work with her.

‘We had a great relationship and I learned a great deal from her,’ he says. ‘She went through a lot as a player and it’s great to spend any time with legends of the game. It will only make me a better coach. I think she is going to be very good for Andy, they have the same ideas about how to move forward and win Slams.’

Vallverdu’s standing in Lendl’s eyes was such that when Berdych approached his compatriot about coaching — and Lendl declined due to the family and wider commitments that caused him to leave Murray last March — he was quick to recommend the Venezuelan.

‘Ivan was a great mentor. Inside and outside of the court he is a great person and taught me a lot,’ said Vallverdu.

Relationships between coaches and players are intense enough in tennis, even without a deep friendship mixed in. Not all end amicably. Vallverdu acknowledges it has been ‘a bit weird’ being here in an opposite camp to Murray.

‘It was always going to be strange. The first day I got here he was hitting on the Rod Laver Arena with James Ward and I gave him a big hug and said hello. I am close friends with the rest of the team, they will be friends for the rest of my life.

‘Andy and I haven’t spent much time together in the last few months and that’s very unusual. The more time we spend together like this the more normal it will become.

‘I’ll always be extremely grateful for the opportunity he gave me and the trust he put in me. We achieved some great things together. There were rough patches too, but most were good.

‘The team was all pulling together, there were no egos. It was always all about Andy, how we can make him better and achieve his goals. We tried to make him the best he could be.

‘The most joy for me was his Olympics win and seeing him presented with the gold medal. It was very special because it was in his own country on Centre Court against Roger Federer.

‘I feel it was a big moment for him to define his career. Getting over that hurdle I really think helped him win the US Open and Wimbledon. It added self-belief.

‘I think Andy will win Slams again, he still has the hunger and he is a special talent and competitor.’

Vallverdu’s task now is to coax a first Major out of Berdych, who came closest when he reached the Wimbledon 2010 final. 

‘I was going to take a bit of time out but it’s a great opportunity and the first few weeks have been good,’ he says. ‘Tomas is a good guy with a lot of talent who works hard.’
