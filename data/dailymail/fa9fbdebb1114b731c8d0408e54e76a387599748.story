Tesco faces a wider-reaching probe into its finances amid suspicions a black hole in its accounts is far bigger than originally stated.

Britain’s biggest supermarket is already under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office over claims it inflated profits by £263million in the first six months of this financial year. 

But now the Financial Reporting Council, the professional body for accountants, wants to formally investigate accounts filed in 2012, 2013 and 2014.

An accounting authority has announced an investigation into a £263million 'black hole' in Tesco's finances

It says the wider inquiry is needed to discover whether the suspect practices went on for many years – and whether the amount of money involved was much higher.

The investigation is extremely serious, for companies have a legal duty to give accurate information to shareholders and the City so they can decide whether to invest their savings and pensions in them.

The inquiry will not only look at Tesco’s accounts but also the role of the firm’s auditors, PwC, who signed off the figures as a true and accurate account record.

The accounting scandal was revealed by Tesco’s new chief executive, Dave Lewis, who was parachuted in to the business in September to help turn around a fall in sales and profits. One of his first jobs was to order the suspension of a number of firm’s most senior executives, some of whom have since left the business.

The problem is understood to relate to a series of complex payments between Tesco and its suppliers.

It involved a tactic of first agreeing a price with suppliers, but then demanding rebate payments from these same firms to stock their products and ensure they were displayed on prominent shelves. The timing of these payments may have been manipulated to make the firm’s financial performance appear stronger than it was.

Mr Lewis has now scrapped this regime in favour of a more transparent system. 

Tesco recently issued a new profit warning suggesting the figure for the current financial year will be down by around 60 per cent on 2013 to no more than £1.4billion. 

Tesco first announced in September that it had discovered an accounting problem relating to expected results for the first half of the current financial year.

A subsequent probe by Deloitte into the affair, which involved rebates from suppliers being moved to different periods on the company's balance sheet, found it had been going on at least as far back as the 2012/13 period.

The FRC has already said it was 'giving careful consideration' as to whether it should take regulatory action.

Today the body said it had launched a probe 'in relation to the preparation, approval and audit' of Tesco's financial statements in the financial years ending in 2012, 2013 and 2014. 

It will also cover 'conduct in relation to the matters reported in the company's interim results' for the first half of the current financial year - when the Deloitte probe was published.

It is the latest in a series of probes that have rocked the supermarket chain and seen executives suspended

The investigation will cover members of professional accountancy bodies, from either Tesco or its auditors, who were involved with the accounts, as well as the member firm, PwC, which was and remains Tesco's auditor.

PwC said in a statement: 'We take our responsibilities very seriously and remain committed to delivering work to the highest professional standards. We will cooperate fully with the FRC in its inquiries.'

PwC said it would have been responsible for the external audit element of the statements. The preparation and approval were done by Tesco.

The latest investigation opens up Tesco's books to scrutiny going back a year further than the previous investigation by Deloitte.

Results of that probe published alongside half-year figures this year showed a £118 million hit for the latest period, plus £70 million for 2013/14 and £75 million for 2012/13. But the FRC investigation goes back to the year ended 2012.

The FRC has powers to issue unlimited fines to individuals or firms or to suspend them from professional accounting bodies.

A Tesco spokesman said: 'We note the Financial Reporting Council is launching an investigation into individuals and a member firm in relation to the preparation, approval and audit of our accounts for the last three years. We will provide support to the FRC's investigation.'

It is the latest challenge facing the supermarket coming a couple of weeks after it issued a £500 million profits warning - its fourth this year.

Tesco said earnings would be hit by investments in price and availability of its products as well as a shake-up of the way it handles its supply chain in the wake of the accounting scandal.

Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Mike Dennis said profits warning implied its UK profits for the second half would be virtually wiped out.

Chief executive Dave Lewis, appointed in September, has temporarily taken charge of the supermarket's UK operations during its key Christmas trading period. Sales have been squeezed amid a price war spurred by the threat of discounters Aldi and Lidl.

Eight executives including UK managing director Chris Bush were suspended in the wake of the accounting scandal.

Mr Bush and three others have now left, one has returned to his job and three remain suspended. Mr Lewis has said the suspensions do not indicate guilt.
