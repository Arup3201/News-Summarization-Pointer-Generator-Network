Demi wants Ashton to pay maintenance and legal costs 

Filed response three months after Ashton moved to legally end marriage

Ashton earned $24m last year from new show Two And A Half Men

Demi Moore is seeking spousal support and money for legal fees from estranged husband Ashton Kutcher in their divorce battle, it emerged on Thursday.

The news comes more than a year after the pair split and three months after Kutcher filed papers to legally sever their six-year marriage.

Moore finally responded on Thursday by lodging her own application at the Los Angeles Superior Court.

Moore cites 'irreconcilable differences' as the reason for the split, stating the date of marriage as September 24th, 2005 and the date of separation as November 17 , 2011 - two months after Kutcher's alleged one-night stand with party girl Sara Leal.

While the couple have no children together, the financial stakes are high.

Costly split: Demi Moore is seeking spousal support from Ashton Kutcher in their divorce battle after lodging an application at the Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday

The pair are jointly worth a reputed $285m and in the last year alone Kutcher earned $24m from the CBS show Two And A Half Men.

On Wednesday it was reported how talks between the couple have broken down over money.

The pair could now be facing a courtroom showdown to resolve their differences.

Kutcher, 35, is said to have become ‘hostile’ whilst Moore, 50, has supposedly ‘had enough’ of his refusal to budge.

The couple split in 2011 after six 
years together and since then there has been much speculation about why
 they have not formally divorced.

Rebuttal: Moore filed her own divorce application, three months after Kutcher started the severance process

A source told the New York Post that 
money could well be the issue - Kutcher is the highest paid actor in US 
TV.

His personal fortune is estimated at $135 whilst Moore’s is thought to be around $150m thanks to her hit 
films in the 1980s and 90s.

A source told the New York Post: 
‘Ashton made a lot of money after marrying Demi - a lot more than she 
made - but despite him becoming just as famous through her, he believes 
he doesn’t owe her that much.

‘Ashton has been very difficult during the talks. You could even say he has been hostile.

‘After over a year of attempting to 
reach a settlement, Demi is definitely ready to move on. It’s hoped 
lawyers for both sides can reach a settlement this spring, otherwise the
 divorce will go into litigation and trial.’

As they were: The couple split in 2011 but Demi 
is now keen to end it once and for all after growing sick of 
the financial settlement

Both parties have called in 
heavyweight lawyers and Moore is being represented by New York-based 
William Beslow, who recently won a large settlement for Linda 
Evangelista against French businessman François-Henri Pinault over their
 five-year-old daughter.

Kutcher has hired Los Angeles celebrity lawyer Laura Wasser.

Moore’s marriage to Kutcher raised 
eyebrows not only because of the 15-year age gap, but also because he was 
not that much older than her own three daughters from her previous 
marriage to Bruce Willis, 57.

In the wake of the breakup there were
 also fears for her wellbeing after she appeared in public looking 
extremely thin and was rushed to hospital after suffering an apparent 
seizure.

Moore subsequently checked into a US 
rehab clinic after it was claimed that she was abusing nitrous oxide, 
otherwise known as laughing gas.

The episode, from which she has now 
recovered, marked a sad fall from grace for the woman who was once the 
highest paid actress in Hollywood and earned up to £8million a film for 
classics like Ghost and A Few Good Men.

Kutcher and Moore's six-year marriage
 came to an end in 2011 amid claims he had an affair with 22-year-old San 
Diego-based administrative assistant Sara Leal.

Moore
 said at the time: 'As a woman, a mother and a wife there are certain 
values and vows that I hold sacred, and it is in this spirit that I have
 chosen to move forward with my life.'

He
 added: 'I will forever cherish the time I spent with Demi. Marriage is 
one of the most difficult things in the world and unfortunately 
sometimes they fail.'

Moving on: Ashton has since found love with actress Mila Kunis and the pair have become inseparable, while Demi is still single

While Kutcher moved on with 29-year-old Kunis in July, Moore struggled to cope with the split.

She entered rehab in February soon 
after collapsing at her Beverly Hills home. She had been smoking ‘an 
incense-like substance’ as well as inhaling nitrous oxide.

Her relationship with her three 
daughters with ex-husband Bruce Willis - Rumer, 24, Scout, 21, and 
Tallulah, 18, - also came under strain last year.

Date night: Mila and Ashton were seen enjoying each other's company in Los Angeles over the weekend as Demi readies filing the legal papers

Sources say they have grown tired of her constant partying and erratic behaviour.

The girls had initially supported their 
mother following her divorce from Kutcher because they believed she was 
'distraught' but were allegedly 'mortified' when she started going out 
with one of Rumer's friends Vito Schnabel.

But Demi was dumped by the 26-year-old 
toyboy several months ago after she enjoyed a week of wild partying at 
Art Basel in Miami.
