And Jose Mourinho opened the door to the veteran striker staying another season at Stamford Bridge after his vintage display against Mauricio Pochettino’s men.

The Ivorian made one and scored another as Chelsea maintained their unbeaten start to the season.

Mourinho lavished praise on his match-winner, admitting he is keen to hand Drogba another 12 month deal when his current contract expires in the summer.

‘He’s remarkable. First of all he’s a team player, after that, he’s one of these with an old days mentality,’ said Mourinho.

‘He’s not selfish, not vain, a humble guy who plays and fights for the team.

‘Is this his last season? I don’t know. It must be his decision. He came here to stay, I want him to stay, the club want him to stay.

‘It will be his decision when he decides to stop as a player. Something personal.’

‘The important thing is he is here and will finish his career with Chelsea. It looks, for me, that he’s going to stay doing other things when he finishes his career.’

Meanwhile, Mourinho insisted Chelsea’s comfortable win over Tottenham proves his side can cope without Diego Costa.

The Spain internationals was suspended for last night’s clash, but the Blues hardly missed their first-choice striker as Drogba produced a virtuoso display.

And even when Drogba was substituted in the second half, his replacement Loic Remy scored an exceptional goal to seal victory.

‘We need Costa, but I think our mentality is the right mentality,’ said Mourinho.

‘We don’t have a player? We don’t cry about it. You give confidence to the others and the others respond in the best way.’

Costa is available for Saturday’s clash against Newcastle, meaning match-winner Drogba could find himself back on the bench at St James’ Park.
