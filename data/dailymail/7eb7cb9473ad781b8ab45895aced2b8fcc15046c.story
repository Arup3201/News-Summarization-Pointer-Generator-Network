Two people were slightly injured in the explosion. Firefighters said the chemicals which have engulfed skies over the town were nitric acid and ferric chloride. 

Exposure to nitric acid vapor can cause problems if it is inhaled, swallowed or comes into contact with the eyes or skin.

Prolonged exposure to the chemical can also lead to breathing difficulties and eventually lung damage.
