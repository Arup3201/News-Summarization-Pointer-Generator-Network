The neice of David Farnell alerted child protection authorities that her paedophile uncle was caring for a baby 10 weeks before news of the Thai surrogacy scandal made international headlines.

The West Australian Department of child protection was made aware of the fact on May 15, but acted only after news of the baby Gammy scandal broke to alert the Farnells they were being investigated for taking Gammy's healthy twin sister, Pipah, under their wing.

WA Premier Colin Barnett told parliament on Wednesday that the niece had alerted the Department, whose Minister Helen Morton claims she knew nothing about until August 4 - 10 weeks after.

Ms Morton said the department did not act immediatley on the information it was provided because it was 'vague, quite guarded and non specific.'

'Anybody bringing information to the department does so probably with some concern for themselves in that circumstance,' The Australian reported.

She said the niece's tip would have likely been caught up in one of 20,000 notifications handled by the department each year.

She also said the department would have made a judgement call not to prioiritise the matter based on 'incomplete information' the neice provided.

She said: 'They (welfare officers) made a priority that In hindsight was not a good priority call.'

The news comes as Ms Morton told media yesterday that Mrs Farnell had taken baby Pipah to China to grieve the death of her mother and would be returning at the end of the month.

She said the department was aware of her departure and ongoing contact was being made on a daily basis with Mr Farnell.

She made the admissions about knowing Mr Farnell had a child 'through an unknown arrangement' during a sitting of WA parliament on Tuesday.

The minister said she found out on August 4 and an investigation began two days later.

On Wednesday, she said the delay in investigating the Farnell family's circumstances was unacceptable and it came about because the South West team was overstretched at the time and had not correctly assessed the case as being a high priority.

The person who had provided the tip-off had spoken in a very guarded way, so the information was 'fairly scant and a bit sketchy, and hard for the department to follow through with', Ms Morton said.

'No address, little information about the child and how it came to be in that place et cetera - there was a paucity of information.'

'This, I think, was a case of staff having too much to do at the same time.'

She said the case was still being assessed by the department, but the process had been held up because Mr Farnell's partner, Wendy, had gone to China after the death of her mother, and taken Pipah with her.

'In the meantime, we've been having daily contact with Mr Farnell,' Ms Morton said.

Opposition spokesman Stephen Dawson said the revelations were a disgrace and 'heads should roll' at the department.

'Somebody has dropped the ball,' he said. 'It's a terrible indictment on the state government and the department that this issue has been let go on for so long.'

'I think the department is still under pressure and I am not sure whether every case is getting the attention it deserves.'

But Ms Morton said a second South West team had been added after a four-month review that ended in August.

'I'm assured that something like this won't happen again,' she said.
