Following England's hard day's night against Uruguay, members of the Three Lions squad have amusingly been mocked up as The Beatles on the front page of Brazilian newspaper Lance.

Using the Liverpool band's famous Abbey Road album cover, Daniel Sturridge, Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney and manager Roy Hodgson have been depicted as the scouse foursome.

After defeat to Uruguay, England say Hello to Costa Rica on Tuesday but will likely have to say Goodbye to the tournament.

However, the Three Lions will also need help from Italy if they hope to progress.

On Thursday night, England defender Phil Jagielka was a nowhere man as Liverpool striker Suarez rose to head home.

It seems all Wayne Rooney needed was love and a little help from his friends, though, as the striker scored his first World Cup goal to draw England level.

England's day trippers twisted and shouted in the stands and had to come together to roar the team on.

Suarez later doubled his tally to win the game for Uruguay however and England certainly weren't feeling fine as they then failed to get back into the game.

It looked like the Liverpool frontman wanted to hold Gerrard's hand to console his club captain at the full-time whistle.

It remains to be seen whether Hodgson and Co can work it out and progress down the long and winding road to the World Cup final at the Maracana Stadium.

However with the Yellow Submarines of Brazil possibly standing in the way, perhaps England will just have to let it be.

Yesterday, England's troubles certainly seemed so far away.
