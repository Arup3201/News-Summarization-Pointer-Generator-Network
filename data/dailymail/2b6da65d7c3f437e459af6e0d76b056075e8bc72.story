Two girls who won a Radio 1 competition to meet One Direction experienced the 'disappointment of a lifetime' when the offer was withdrawn - and then they got seats at the back of the concert hall. 

The BBC was forced to apologise after friends Hannah Hastings, 20, and Louisa Marsden, 21, complained they travelled to the show in Belfast under 'false pretenses'.

The girls spent £350 on flights and a hotel to meet their heroes and were also promised the best seats in the Belfast Odyssey Arena. But in reality they were a 'long way from the front'.

When they arrived for the March 11 One Direction gig, a representative from Radio 1 told the pair they 
would not be meeting their heroes - dashing their dreams of coming face-to-face with their idol 
Harry Styles.

Law 
student Hannah and media student Louisa immediately complained to the 
BBC and television watchdog Ofcom saying they were misled by Radio 1.

Hannah said: 'We were so excited when we won - we are both massive fans of the band and especially Harry Styles.

Promise: Hannah and Louisa were disappointed when they travelled to Belfast to meet One Direction only to be told that they wouldn't be able to

'We heard the competition for tickets being advertised on Radio 1 so I phoned up and got through.

'It was specifically stated by Radio 1 DJ Gemma Cairney that the prize offered the opportunity to meet and greet the One Direction boys themselves.

'I went live on air and correctly answered questions about which cities in Britain One Direction were playing.

'Radio 1 had been building it up all day as an amazing experience for One Direction fans.

'But the seats were nothing special at all and we were a long way from the front.'

The prize was offered on Radio 1 
throughout the day on March 10 with the 'Take 3' competition broadcast 
live on the Jameela Jamil Official Chart Show.

Prize: The BBC say that the offer of a 'meet and greet' with the band was only broadcast once and then rectified live on air

Hannah
and Louise, of Newport, South Wales, say the trip cost more than front 
row tickets for the band's shows on their doorstep in Cardiff.

One Direction rose to fame when they 
came third on the X Factor in 2010. Despite being formed on the show, 
the band became a huge hit, particularly with teenage girls, resulting 
in a string of number one hits and international awards.

Breakout star Harry Styles has also spent the last year hitting headlines with rumours of womanizing, partying and a high profile relationship with musician Taylor Swift.

Mistake: Hannah said Radio 1 DJ Gemma Cairney announced on air that the winner would meet the band

Furious Hannah said: 'I really thought I'd won something special.

'But
from the moment we arrived in Belfast we were told there would be no 
meet and greet. The BBC knew we were flying over from Cardiff at our own
expense.

'They also knew 
the prize they were offering was not worth us spending all that money 
and flying all that way for two below average tickets.

'I have made an official complaint saying the prize on offer was inaccurate and we went to the concert on false pretenses.

'It was the disappointment of a lifetime for any 1D fan.'

Although
the BBC say that the promise of a meet and greet was just broadcast on 
air once, the girls say they heard it twice and that they didn't hear 
any correction.

Chris 
Humphrys, the Content and Schedules Manager for Radio 1, has written to 
the girls saying he is 'sorry' they feel they were let down by the 
station.

An Ofcom spokesman confirmed they were assessing the complaint, which could lead to an investigation.

A BBC spokeswoman said: 'The error in which a Radio 1 DJ mistakenly referred to the prize as a 'meet and greet' was corrected on air and the nature of the prize was clearly communicated throughout the day.

'The prize of tickets to the sold-out One Direction concert was provided in accordance with the terms and conditions of the competition.

'As a gesture of good will, we have also arranged for the winner to receive personalised signed merchandise from the band.'
