A property tycoon whose wife left him for Cesc Fabregas said today that British courts 'favour badly behaved women' after a judge refused to halt the sale of his £5.5million flat to the footballer as part of the divorce settlement. 

Elie Taktouk, 38, whose former wife, 
Daniella Semaan, gave birth to Fabregas' baby in April, tried to block 
the sale on the basis that the Barcelona star's offer was £2million less than 
its true value.

However a judge ruled last month the family home, a Grade-II listed Belgravia flat, just yards from Buckingham Palace, should be sold as part of divorce proceedings.

Mr Taktouk told The Evening Standard: 'They [the courts] are not interested if you are right or wrong, they are just trying to protect the woman, they protect the badly behaved ones, not the well behaved ones who are dedicated to their work, family or life – they don’t get anything.

'It’s a gross injustice that the system has done and will continue to do with everyone.'

Mr Taktouk said the court system allowed the footballer to buy the flat for £2million below what he says is its true £7.5million valuation.

After the sale to Fabregas was approved by the High Court, Mr Taktouk launched a last-ditch bid for time to look for a bid closer to his valuation but Lord Justice Floyd at the Court of Appeal threw out his application to block the sale.

Mr Taktouk said today while he respects 
the court system, he criticised the family courts and said his case 
should be a 'wake-up call' to other men.

Miss
 Semaan told the court she will not be able to stay in the flat when it 
is signed over to her boyfriend as Fabregas will use it as an 
'investment'.

In a statement read out in court, she said: 'If the property is sold to Mr Fabregas, it is my understanding that it will be used as an investment and rented out in order to cover the cost of the purchase, and/or generate some income.'

Mr Taktouk's barrister, Stephen Lyon, had told the court that other parties were willing to pay closer to £7.5million for the apartment.

But,
 rejecting his case, the appeal judge said encouraging more offers would
 be a breach of the contract of sale already agreed with Fabregas, and 
that, while unsold, the £4.8 million mortgage is accruing interest of 
£1,000-a-day.

Mr Taktouk had not objected to a sale of the flat to his mother, Mary Taktouk, for a price similar to that being offered by the footballer, he continued.

Mr Taktouk previously objected to having to shell out for a home for his ex-wife as her new boyfriend Cesc Fabregas (pictured together), who is thought to earn £5m-a-year, has millions to lavish on he

Mr Taktouk and his ex-wife married when they were 24 and living in Lebanon.

They had two children before their separation in 2011, months after Miss Semaan was seen on holiday with the 25-year-old footballer.

Mr Taktouk had previously objected to having to shell out for a home for his ex-wife in circumstances where her new boyfriend, who is thought to earn £5m-a-year, has millions to lavish on her.

In a court hearing in April, he claimed she had significantly under-stated the financial support she would get from Fabregas.

She said his only obligation was to support their child and all she got was the price of flights, presents and being looked after when she is in Spain.

Her evidence led family judge, Mr Justice Coleridge, to rule that the flat be sold.

The proceeds, with a top-up from Mr Taktouk, would provide her with the £1.4m she needed to find a home of her own.
