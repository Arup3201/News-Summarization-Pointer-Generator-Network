They are some of the world's greatest ever horse racing names, but new research has suggested that the likes of Seabiscuit, Man O'War, Secretariat and Seattle Slew may all have a distant genetic connection.

Researchers have claimed that all the best thoroughbreds of racing are all very distantly related after tracing the 'speed gene' they all share to a single ancestor from the 17th century.

Experts at University College Dublin analysed DNA from nearly 600 horses and 22 modern breeds, and were able to predict what the horses had in common genetically.

Scientists analysing horse DNA traced the 'speed gene' back to a single British mare in the 17th century

Their results showed how the 'speed gene' which saw racing greats like Man O'War and Seabiscuit power to victory was passed to the famous horses from a single founder, a British mare around 300 years ago.

The British ancestor was racing in the mid-17th century at a time when local British breeds were pre-eminent in racing horses and before the foundation of the thoroughbred racehorse.

In finding the 'speed gene', a C type myostatin gene variant, researchers studied genetic data from hundreds of horses, as well as the skeletal remains of 12 thoroughbred stallions born between 1764 and 1930.

Their research also included DNA from 330 elite performing thoroughbreds, 40 donkeys and two zebras.

Legend: U.S. thoroughbred Seattle Slew remains the only horse to win the Triple Crown while undefeated

Iconic: Man O'War, thought to be one of the greatest thoroughbreds of all time, won 20 of his 21 races.

Record breaker: U.S. horse Secretariat set records in two Triple Crown races which still stand to this day

Famous: Seabiscuit became the subject of a book and two films followings its success

Modern variants recently traced successful thoroughbreds back to legendary mare Nearctic, who lived between 1954 and 1973.

The variant branched out to Nearctic's son Northern Dancer, which according to LiveScience was the most bred stallion of modern times.

Norther Dancer never finished lower than third and won 14 of his 18 races.

But the new research has now traced the success of modern thoroughbreds back to a single horse over 300 years ago.

Researcher Emmeline Hill, a genomics scientist at University College Dublin who led the study, said: 'Changes in racing since the foundation of the Thoroughbred have shaped the distribution of 'speed gene' types over time and in different racing regions.

'But we have been able to identify that the original 'speed gene' variant entered the Thoroughbred from a single founder, which was most likely a British mare about 300 years ago.

'Having first identified the 'speed gene' in 2010, we decided to see if we could trace the origin of the gene variant using population genetics coupled with pedigree analysis.

'We wanted to understand where speed in the Thoroughbred came from.'

Researchers said all great sprinting horses shared two genes associated with muscle development.

The genetic combination was not present in regular farm horses, donkeys or zebras.
