Recent photographs of Rosie Huntington–Whiteley modelling her latest collection for M&S set pulses racing, and women flocking to the shops.

Now the model has tweeted a video of herself discussing the inspirations behind the new range with her co-designer M&S lingerie guru Soozie Jenkinson.

Looking chic and laid back in a black jersey jumper and simple trousers, the 26-year-old talks about how she is involved in every stage of the design process.

Rosie is celebrating one year of her lingerie line with M&S

‘I send a lot of photographs of inspirations, I pick up things from flea markets and vintage fairs,’ she explains.

'Our collaborations are very two way, it’s kind of on going,’ Soozie agrees.

The interview is interspersed with shots of Rosie modelling the 'Rosie for Autograph' collection.

‘I like to try everything on before it goes to production to really feel the products, see how they sit on the body, make sure that I want to wear them and really understand the cuts and fabrics, she explains.

And seeing her toned and lean body lounging across vintage couches in the video, it is little wonder that the British born model likes to try on lingerie.

Key items within the anniversary collection include both updates on favourite styles and brand new pieces, which the retailer hopes will keep the collection fresh.

‘The soft cup bra is one of the main pieces that we are introducing to the collection that we haven’t done before,’ Rosie says.

The model picks out her favourite example of the new bra; a simple cream lace bra with a silk mauve ribbon which is tied at the back.

‘I hope that women would wear this and be proud to flash it a little bit,’ Rosie says as she blushes.

Following a sell-out year, this one year anniversary collection looks set to be another success story for the model.

Using
 luxurious fabrics such as silk and French designed lace, the duo are 
aiming to put a more vintage spin on original designs.

Rosie tweeted the video, which explains how she is a very hands on in the design process

Pulling
 a green, lace trimmed bra of the rack she says: ‘This is such a 
beautiful green and it’s so royal, it has this gold, mossy feel to it 
almost.

‘I am also a 
particular fan of the print we have done this season, which is on a 
muted black back drop. It just has this really soft romantic feel to 
it.'

Soozie agrees, saying: ‘I think when 
we were talking about the pre-Raphaelite inspiration what was so 
wonderful in the paintings was the reference always back to nature.’

Speaking
 about the success of her collections,store which has seen the exclusive
 collaboration become one of the most popular lingerie collections ever 
launched by M&S, Rosie says ‘I’m thrilled, it’s so exciting. It’s 
very flattering and it makes me want to keep doing it. It is a huge 
honour for me.’
