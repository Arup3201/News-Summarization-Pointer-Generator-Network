Once tipped for greatness like his Everton Academy team-mate Ross Barkley, Gerard Kinsella hit rock bottom with a telephone call from his club Fleetwood Town in February 2013.

Kinsella was ordered in and it was confirmed he had failed a drugs test. The anabolic steroid nandrolone had been discovered in his system and once the wheels of justice had turned, he was hit with a two-year ban — the longest punishment for any current professional player in England.

But behind the bald facts of a so-called ‘drugs cheat’ is a tragic story of a young player driven to depression and despair by the difficulties he faced trying to achieve his dream.

Encouragingly, the major powers in English football have also shown a human side and Kinsella has revealed in an exclusive interview with The Mail On Sunday that he has just been given the green light by the FA to resume training again with a football club — the first step in what he hopes will be a successful comeback.

Kinsella always maintained he never deliberately took performance-enhancing drugs.

He was in constant agony caused by a chronic shoulder injury that saw it come out of its socket every day in training. When his cousin Neil Kinsella offered pain relief with an injection, Gerard agreed out of desperation, not suspecting he might be contravening anti-doping regulations.

That summer of 2013 when the ban was imposed passed in a blur for Kinsella, who was 21 at the time. ‘I thought, that’s me finished,’ he said. ‘I couldn’t be bothered with football any more. My head was gone.

‘I kept playing it over in my mind. I was sure my chance in football was over and all I’d ever be remembered for was failing a drugs test.’

It seemed a devastating end to a once promising career. Having first joined Everton at the tender age of seven, Kinsella was held in high regard at the club during his teenage years. 

But the FA has given him the green light to find a new club and start training again

He had been on the books at Everton since the age of just seven

Experienced coaches there including Kevin Sheedy, a league championship and European trophy winner with the club, and academy director Ray Hall thought he would make it along with another emerging youngster, Barkley.

But the downward spiral began when he suffered the first dislocation of his shoulder. What happened next would fill a medical journal. Two operations on his shoulder, a fractured metatarsal, broken collar bone, torn cartilage, viral meningitis and four separate ankle ligament injuries, the worst after chipping an ankle with the Republic of Ireland Under-16s.

Everton manager David Moyes reluctantly let him go at 19. But spells at Plymouth Argyle and Fleetwood, punctuated by a loan spell at Conference club Telford, saw the curse continue.

So when Neil offered him a cure for the pain, Kinsella foolishly took it. He said: ‘Looking back, I was just desperate. I was going to training and my shoulder was popping out all the time. Sometimes, it wouldn’t even be a tackle. I’d just be running and it happened.

‘I felt a fraud. I couldn’t call myself a footballer because I couldn’t train or play properly. I hadn’t had a full season since I was 16.’

Fleetwood, then in League Two, ripped up his contract when the ban was confirmed.

At Kinsella’s lowest ebb, an unlikely saviour stepped forward. His brother Michael, a former junior goalkeeper with Liverpool, had been in prison for drug smuggling when Gerard went through his injury hell.

Now back out and clean, Michael decided to make up for lost time and help his younger sibling.

He arranged for the shoulder injury to be cleared up properly, with one of the country’s leading surgeons operating on Gerard for five hours.

Michael also persuaded the leading stakeholders in football that his brother was a victim of circumstance rather than a deliberate drugs cheat.

The players’ union, the PFA, arranged for Gerard to use the facilities used by England players at St George’s Park because his ban prevented him from training with football clubs.

Most importantly, the FA’s disciplinary committee decided to allow him to train again with a football club from November 5, ahead of the complete lifting of his playing ban on February 4, 2015.

The midfielder will take advantage by training with his local club AFC Liverpool from the North West Counties Football League, though the longer-term hope would be to play higher up the pyramid. ‘This will be like starting all over again,’ he says.

A fortnight ago, Kinsella was shopping in Liverpool town centre and by chance bumped into his pal Barkley, now an England international.

‘Of course we stopped and chatted to each other, we played together for years didn’t we,’ said Kinsella.

‘Funnily enough, the conversation wasn’t about football, more about how we’re doing and everything else. Ross was a talent even at 14, it’s no surprise to me he’s flying now.’

The pair could not have travelled in more opposite directions since their youth-team days. But training with AFC Liverpool next month is a huge date in Kinsella’s diary. The dream is still alive.
