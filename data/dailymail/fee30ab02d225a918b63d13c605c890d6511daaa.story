Adnan Januzaj says that he is happy to carry the burden of wearing the Manchester United No 11 shirt famously worn by Ryan Giggs for 20 years.

He wore the shirt for the first time during United's defeat to Swansea at Old Trafford. Januzaj admitted feeling a mixture of pride and pressure. 

'It was a big honour for me and my family and I was very happy to have it given to me,' the Belgian midfielder said.

'There is pressure on me because there was a legend in front of me who had it for 20 years, but I am really happy with that.'

Januzaj downplayed Manchester United's loss to Swansea and insists nobody should read into the result.

There are high hopes for the 19-year old this season, but the United midfielder is simply focusing on the next game.

He added: 'It was a very disappointing match but it's only the first one of the season so it's nothing,'

'We'll move on to the next one now.'
