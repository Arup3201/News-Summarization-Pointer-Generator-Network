Wednesday's Republican primary debate for the Idaho governor's race was broadcast on a 30-second delay because one of the candidates, the leader of a biker gang, is known for public profanity and making racist jokes.

He's no fan of law-enforcement, complaining during the debate that motorcycle riders 'are cop-magnets, like a Playboy bunny in a mini-skirt gets hit on all the time,' comparing their treatment to that of blacks before the civil rights movement.

Another fringe hopeful on the stage insists that nuclear accidents were foretold in the Bible, and that every American should take potassium iodide tablets to protect their thyroid glands.

Sitting Governor Butch Otter insisted that any debate must include long-shot candidates who qualify for the May 20 primary. If he was looking for comic relief, he got it in spades.

'I don't like political correctness. Can I say this? It sucks! It's bondage,' Harley Brown told a statewide audience on Idaho Public Television. He was missing a front tooth and spoke with a cigar stuck in his shirt pocket.

'You have your choice, folks: A cowboy, a
 curmudgeon, a biker or a normal guy. Take your pick!'

The 2014 Idaho Republican primary debate for governor presented voters with the choice between 'a cowboy, a curmudgeon, a biker or a normal guy.' Pictured (L-R) are Harley Brown, Walt Bayes, Gov. Butch Otter and state Sen. Russ Fulcher

Straight face: Walt Bayes nearly brought Gov. Butch Otter to giggles when he claimed his wife had driven for three years without a license because she refused to take her car for emissions testing, and 'nobody done nothing'

Harley Brown assured his fellow candidates: 'Don't think I'm crazy, 'cause I?m not.'

Brown, a 
former Boise cab driver whose biker jacket is emblazoned with the 
slogan, 'Hey diddle diddle, right up the middle,' said that he's 'about 
as politically correct as your proverbial turd in the punchbowl. And I'm
 proud of it, and I'm going for it.'

'And I'm going for the vote of the real people out there, not these bondage-type people who don't have a clue about picking up strangers at night and hauling them God-knows-where,' he added. 'Try that for awhile.'

His plan for taking back land rights from the federal government is a blueprint for online mockery.

Future Republican president? Harley Brown called himself 'about as politically correct as your proverbial turd in the punchbowl'

'I've got a Master's in raisin' hell, okay? ... Here's my plan of attack,' he told Spokesman-Review political writer Betsy Russel, one of the debate moderators. 'You go in there, and you use spiritual warfare.'

'You bind those evil spirits that are behind the feds with the blood of Jesus, the name of Jesus, the power of entombment of the Holy Spirit, the power of agreement, the word of God. Take air superiority, and then roll in with your tanks on the ground, like ... lawsuits. Blitzkrieg!'

'Mr. Brown,' Russell deadpanned when he was done, 'the question was about taxes.'

Competing for a role as Saturday Night Live's next national lampoon was Walt Bayes, a walking caricature of Uncle Jesse from 'The Dukes of Hazzard,'

He scorched Otter for allowing the federal government to dictate forest policy –  'Our forests are cut like somebody raising tomatoes: "Well, they're purty red, don't pick 'em"' – and railed against Idaho's history of jailing home-schooling parents.

'What would you do if they came out to take your kids?' he asked. 'Well, I'd shoot 'em – what else would you do?'

At one point Bayes, whose nametag was misspelled throughout the debate, slammed the governor for his un-Republican demands that cars meet strict emissions standards.

'He tried to make me take an emissions test,' the elderly candidate complained, 'and I told him what to do with it.'

'My wife drove for three years without any license over it,' Bayes boasted. 'Nobody done anything.'

The moment that will likely go viral, however, came when Idaho Statesman political columnist Dan Popkey asked Brown to explain his online, off-color humor.

'You've posted bigoted jokes on your website,' Popkey sniped, 'skewering women and gays and Jews and Asians and Polish people like me.'

'And bikers and Irishmen too. I hit myself,' Brown responded.

That settles it: In his closing statement, Brown produced a laminated letter that he claimed was from an African bishop, certifying that almighty God had told him he would be President of the United States someday

Bayes told a TV audience of potential Republican voters that the Bible foretold the Chernobyl nuclear accident and predicts more radiation disasters in the future

'Those "Harleyisms," as I call it, had a lot of warnings on there – you know, "You might find this offensive",' he explained. 'But I hit everybody. Jews, Polish people, Irish, Italians, religious jokes and black jokes.'

'And by 
the way, my wife screened that. And we took the real hard-core zingers 
out. So in case I catch any flak ... I can fire that back and attack my 
attackers.'

Idaho gubernatorial fringe candidate Harley Brown drew heat during the debate for posting bigoted jokes on his campaign website.

In an online disclaimer, he warns that they 'may be construed by those of a gentle nature, a sensitive disposition or the young, to be offensive, shocking or even obscene.'

Here are some of the ones we can print.:

Otter and his more mainstream challenger, state Sen. Russ Fulcher, struggled to keep a straight face.

One heated exchange focused on Otter's early support for – and later flip-flop on – a federal ban on hunting wolves.

'Our wolves – they're here because we let somebody put 'em here,' Bayes said.

'Governor Otter wants to kill a wolf. I did kill a wolf while it was still an endangered species.'

Bayes turned his closing statement into a non-sequitur rant against nuclear energy, claiming that scripture foretold an infamous 1986 nuclear accident in the former Soviet republic of Ukraine.

'You remember Chernobyl, where the Russians had a little problem with their atomic energy?' he recalled. 'Chernobyl – when you translate that into English it comes out "Wormwood." Wormwood is mentioned in the Bible a whole lot where you're studying the last days, and it's radiation.'

He urged the debate audience to take potassium iodide pills in order to block their thyroid glands from radiation poisoning. The pills are 'good for 20 years,' he said, 'and I'd rather have it 20 years early than 5 minutes late.'

'When that little deal happened in Japan – just like that, you couldn't buy it. You couldn't find any anywhere.'

'And another thing you want to know is our energy plants that's run by atomic, they can stand one-fifteenth of an earthquake like that one in Japan!' Bayes concluded. 'And my Bible says it's going to get worse and worse and worse!'

But Brown stole the show with his closing monologue, claiming that the Idaho governorship would be just a test-run for the White House.

'I need practice! Practice!' he said. 'I 
don't want to say stuff like, "Sorry if our bombing caused you any 
inconvenience." So I want to work in the Little League, as the governor.'

And in Blues Brothers fashion, Brown is on a mission from God.

'If the Supreme Court goes to hell, I'm not following,' Walt Bayes said, pledging to enforce state laws on abortion regardless of the federal government's position

'After God told me he was going to make me president, I went out and got the Presidential Seal tattooed right here on my shoulder,' he boasted. 'My morale went from negative 500 off the scale, and I started a presidential campaign right there. I'm a type A-A-plus guy.'

'And I was living in Fat Jack's cellar 'cause my ex-wife had given me trumped-up restraining orders,' he continued. 'I couldn't see my kids. It was a mess. And Fat Jack's old lady, Fat Jack's wife, said, "Get this lunatic out of my cellar! He's starting a presidential campaign! I'm getting calls from the media on all this!"'

'For three years I had the credibility of Chicken Little – you know, "The sky is falling"? And finally, one day this bishop from African comes over. He says, "I am a prophet of the most high God, and in that office I here authenticate that God told you that." I says, "Yeah? You mind putting that in writing?" He said, "Sure."'

As Brown pulled a laminated letter out of his pocket, he delivered his coup de grace.

'And he put it in writing, and I got the original at home and I was able to go up to all my detractors and say, "Naah-na-naaah-na-naah-naah!"'
