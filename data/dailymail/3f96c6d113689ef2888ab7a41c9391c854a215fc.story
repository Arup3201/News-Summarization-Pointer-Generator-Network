Danny Cipriani and Nick Easter are set to be dramatically recalled by England on Wednesday and handed the chance to resurrect their careers at the Six Nations.

Both men had feared their international prospects were fading as they were out of favour with England coach Stuart Lancaster and his assistants, even though Sale fly-half Cipriani produced positive cameo appearances during the tour of New Zealand last summer. 

Harlequins No 8 Easter has not featured in any squad under the current regime and, at the age of 36, it was assumed his time at the top had passed.

But when Lancaster announces a squad at Twickenham on Wednesday to prepare for the Six Nations opener against Wales in Cardiff on February 6, it is understood Cipriani, 27, and Easter will have made the cut.

Their selection is part of an overhaul caused by injuries and changing form. In the absence of Manu Tuilagi, Bath’s quick outside centre Jonathan Joseph will step in.
