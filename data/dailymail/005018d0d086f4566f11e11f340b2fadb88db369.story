It’s the sort of drama that could have quite easily come straight from the comedy classic itself.

A Reliant Robin van went up in flames while it was being driven by Only Fools and Horses fan Michael Waterson, who had owned a replica of the famous yellow three-wheeler for 20 years.

The 65-year-old used the vehicle to promote his Trotters Bar - but smelled petrol as he was driving along in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, before the car spluttered to a halt and stopped traffic.

He got out just as smoke started billowing from the engine and watched helplessly as his van went up in flames. Fire crews put out the blaze and left the sorry remains of the chassis and two seats.

Mr Waterson, who paid £700 for the van, said: ‘It is very sad - it was a genuine supervan. I had it for 20 years but only ever took it out on special occasions to promote the pub.

‘It only ever did 200 miles a year max. It wasn’t the nicest van to drive, and they had an awful image with reliability. I had spent hundreds of pounds renovating it.

‘I won’t be able to get another one. They are so hard to get hold of - that’s why I kept it for so long. My hobby has always been with cars and I love Only Fools.’

Mr Waterson’s van was a familiar sight 
outside the bar, which is full of other memorabilia from Only Fools and Horses, the long-running BBC comedy. He has owned the venue for 23 years.

He added: ‘Many people parked outside my pub to have photographs taken with the car. A lot of people have asked me what’s happened to it and when I’ve told them they have all been devastated.

'There’s absolutely nothing left at all except the chassis and two seats. I’m absolutely distraught'

‘There’s absolutely nothing left at all except the chassis and two seats. The whole thing happened so quickly and I knew straight away that something was not right.

'I’m absolutely distraught and now I’m desperately looking to find another one. It was my baby.’

The British-built Reliant Robin was produced from 1973 to 2002. The model also appeared in Mr Bean and its notorious instability was the subject of a feature on BBC show Top Gear in 2010.

A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said the circumstances around the fire were being investigated.

Only Fools and Horses ran from 1981 to 2003 and featured the many failed ventures of Del Boy, played 
by Sir David Jason, and his hopeless brother Rodney Trotter, played by Nicholas Lyndhurst.
