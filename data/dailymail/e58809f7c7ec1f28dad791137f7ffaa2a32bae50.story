They say a brand can live or die by its name, and Alexandra Watkins, a San Francisco native and professional wordsmith, has found she has an unusual talent for finding just the right ones.

The Californian-born former ad copywriter owns her own company, Eat My Words, whose clients pay her up to $50,000 a pop to come up with catchy new names for their products.

Ms Watkins has generated thousands of names for snacks, software, sunscreen, social networking sites, sportswear, serums, and seafood (and that’s just the S’s!) for companies including Dunkin' Donuts, Disney, Microsoft and Proactiv.

A former copywriter for Ogilvy, the ad agency giant responsible for clients including Google and Ikea to name but a few, Ms Watkins quit writing ads and 'turned in her corporate American Express card' nine years ago to start the company of her dreams, scoring her first major client via a Match.com date.

So why are companies willing to pay so much for a few or even just one word?

'A name will last longer than any other investment you make in your business,' Ms Watkins tells MailOnline. 'It makes a critical first impression. Even more than your shoes.'

Where the magic happens: Ms Watkins works out her colorful San Francisco office, pictured, and is renowned for creating catchy names that 'make you smile, not scratch your head'

And she has a point. It may only be a 
carbonated drink, but Coca-Cola, for example, is the number one most 
recognized word in the world, second only to 'Hello'.

And though many seasoned marketers agonize for months over what to name a new drink, burger or nail polish shade, Ms Watkins, whose prices start at $15,000, says: 'I can do it with my eyes closed,' before adding, 'Honestly, writers block has never happened to me.'

It generally takes around three weeks of working with a client and bouncing ideas around before Eat My Words settles on the right name and cashes the hefty check, although Ms Watkins claims the perfect name can often hit her straight away.

Food for thought: Most of the company's first clients were products that make people 'fat and drunk,' including Dunkin' Donuts

'Even if we do think of the perfect name right off the bat, we still do a full exploration, just to be sure we are right,' she points out.

The name for her own company came to her 'a flash,' she says, noting that many of her first clients were food and beverage companies.

'I started out naming things that make people fat and drunk,' she remarks, so Eat My Words seemed like a perfect fit.

What's in a name? Ms Watkins, who also counts Proactiv as a client, claims she is enthusiastic 'even about the driest products'

Ms Watkins explains that there are several common mistakes people make when naming their products.

'Names that aren't spelled the way they sound are frustrating for customers,' she says, 'As well as names that are meaningful to you but not your audience.'

She gives poorly-conceived names including SmolkSignal, Xboni and Squrl as examples.

As for products she has crowned with great names, there's I Have A Bean for a coffee company, Mixin' Vixen' for an all-female bar tending service, Stuff A Sock In It for a chain of laundromats and Hand Job for a male-friendly nail salon.

Ms Watkins is unable to disclose some of 
the more famous brands she has worked her magic with, including a 
nationally recognized bacon cheeseburger, whose parent company would 
perhaps rather not reveal where some of its brightest ideas came from.

Around a quarter of her projects are made up of renaming existing products that are in need of a makeover.

Ms Watkins recounts influencing a 25% jump in revenue for a hotel's wedding business, simply by changing up the 'ho-hum' names for their services to ones that are more 'emotionally engaging.'

'A name makes a critical first impression. Even more than your shoes.'

The hotel's Rehearsal Dinner service is now Meet the Parents, their Post-Reception Bar Rental is now Last Call for Alcohol and their Post-Wedding Brunch is now aptly named Bloody Married.

The word wizard, who works out of a jazzy office in San Francisco’s SoMa district, more reminiscent of a Disney house than a thriving marketing agency, claims she is always enthusiastic, 'even about the driest products' and, at the end of the day, operates by her philosophy that a name should 'make you smile, not scratch your head.'

She is currently writing a book on naming called Hello, My Name is Awesome - How to Create Brand Names that Stick, for those who want great names but can't afford her services, which will be released in September.
