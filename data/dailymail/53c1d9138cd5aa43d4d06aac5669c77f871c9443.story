More than two million Pakistanis are trapped in 'modern-day slavery', condemned to a lifetime of hardship to pay back supposed debts, labour campaigners say.

Laws have been in place since the early 1990s to outlaw bonded labour, but still the cycle continues, with thousands of children sucked in every year to help pay back money their parents have often borrowed out of desperation.

At an open-air factory on the edge of Hyderabad, around 90 miles north of Karachi, tall, tapering chimneys belch out noxious smoke.

More than two million Pakistanis are trapped in 'modern-day slavery', condemned to a lifetime of hardship to pay back supposed debts

A Pakistani labourer makes bricks at a brick kiln factory on the outskirts of Hyderabad; A global survey of slavery published last month by the Australian campaign group the Walk Free Foundation said Pakistan had the third most 'slaves' in the world, after India and China.

Crouching children gather lumps of clay and pack them into rectangular moulds. On the ground, long rows of unbaked bricks wait to go into the kiln.

These are the scenes that have been the backdrop to Ranjhan's life since he was a child. For several decades he has worked in a brick kiln as a bonded labourer, tied to his employer by a debt his salary will never enable him to repay.

The father-of-three said: 'I've spent the last 40-odd years in this grind, sometimes in one factory, sometimes in another.'

Ranjhan works seven days a week at the coal-fired kiln, where 1,000 bricks will earn him a little over £1, every cent of which goes straight back to his employer.

'I borrowed 40,000-50,000 rupees (£413-516) to buy food for my children. I will never pay it back before I die - my debt will die with me.' 

A global survey of slavery published last month by the Australian campaign group the Walk Free Foundation said Pakistan had the third most 'slaves' in the world, after India and China. Most work in brick making or agriculture.

Walk Free says the government needs regulate brick kilns and enforce anti-slavery laws.

Ranjihan says little about why he took out the loan in the first place. From buying food to wedding dowries to hospital visits - there is no shortage of reasons why workers enter into lifelong deals with their employers.

Puno Bheel, who set up a brickworkers' union in Hyderabad a few years ago, said: 'Before the union, the workers here didn't even have names, just numbers. If someone came and asked them their name, they'd say 'Ask the boss, he'll tell you.'

And the debt often escalates, as accommodation and food costs are often added.   

Some small trade unions are lobbying bosses to raise salaries to the equivalent of $3 a day and to not trap their workers in the debt cycle.

But despite their best efforts the unions are fighting a difficult battle. A few employers may have improved wages and conditions, but the unions have not persuaded any to free bonded labourers.

But some workers, like Sajan Kumar, have been able to escape.

Five years ago the owner of a rice and pepper farm where he had worked for years with his family demanded £2,877, claiming their work had not covered the cost of feeding them.

Mr Kumar's uncle went to the Green Rural Development Organisation, a campaign group, which took the matter to court.

Workers debts often increase, rather than go down, as their employers add accommodation and food costs to the total they owe

But things only got worse for the farmer and his family. Mr Kumar claims the owner and his men threw him and his extended family in vehicles and drove them into the desert 'chained like animals'.

After days of being held captive, the 87 members of Kumar's extended family, all from the Hindu minority, were rescued by the police.

Mr Kumar said: 'It was slavery, what else would you call it? We were treated like animals, we worked day and night.'

Once freed, the family accusing the landowner of illegal detention, an audacious move in a country where the rich and powerful rule virtually unchallenged in rural areas.

Mr Kumar and his family got more than £12,797 in an out-of-court settlement. 

He now lives in the village of Azad Nagar, near Hyderabad, which is populated by former bonded labourers.

Ghulam Haider, the head of the Green Rural Development Organisation who set up Azad Nagar in 2006, said they had managed to free 28,000 people, but around half of them have ended up back in bonded labour for want of any other work

The family bought a minibus and Mr Kumar opened a grocery.

For little Jenny, her hands worn from work at just 12 years old, the future looks bleak. She has already spent years feeding animals, working in the fields, cleaning houses and pumping water for a landowner.

She said: 'We only got to eat at the end of the day and they beat my brothers. We would say to them, 'Why are you so cruel to us?' and they would reply 'Pay me!'
