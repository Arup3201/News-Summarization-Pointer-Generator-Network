A crazed man - who has hurt himself in public before - went on a raged-filed rant about the IRS and then attempted suicide in full view of Matt Lauer and the Today show team in Rockefeller Plaza this morning.

Pak Chong Mar, 72, from the New York City borough of Queens began to cut his wrists as he stood in the audience for the popular breakfast show, screaming 'the IRS is watching me', before he was pepper sprayed and subdued by NYPD and Today show security.

And it was revealed this afternoon that this is not the first time that Pak has hurt himself in public. In August 1995, he chopped off three of his fingers with a meat cleaver and threw his severed digits at the crowd during the Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival in Flushing.

Police said to the New York Post that officers immediately noticed he was missing three fingers as they battled to removed the two blades he was brandishing.

Conducting an exclusive interview with the New York Daily News from his bedside, Mar told that newspapers reporter how he was flat broke, unable to pay his rent and that this was a last, 'desperate' act.

'I had to do something desperate to fight the corruption, fight the IRS,' Pak Chong Mar told a Daily News reporter from Bellevue Hospital.

Speaking in a rambling fashion as his wife and daughter sat by his bedside, blood covered Mar revealed he arrived in the U.S. from China in 1948 and claimed that his life savings which he valued at over one million dollars had been taken from him.

'I should be living well,' he said. ;I had over a million dollars before. They’re making my life miserable.'

At around 7.50 a.m. Mar, armed with his two blades began 
to cut his own wrists as he stood in the crowd which gathers year-round 
to watch the iconic breakfast show air.

Wearing
 a grey T-shirt and a white baseball cap, Mar staggered through the 
Today show audience and began screaming in broken English about the 
Internal Revenue Service and how it ruined his life.

According
 to witnesses at the scene, Mar was yelling not only about the IRS and 'peppermint tea' 
but was trying to get bystanders to read documents he had brought along -
 which he dramatically threw into the air.

He
 then used a pocket knife with a four-inch blade and exclaimed, 'I'm 
going to cut myself!' before slicing his own wrist and arm.

Dramatic
 pictures and video from the scene reveal how Today show security staff 
and the NYPD drew their guns and rushed to intervene as Mar - who 
never attempted to harm anyone else - collapsed in a pool of his own 
blood on the floor.

He was peppered sprayed as he was subdued.

Court records seen by the MailOnline for a Pak Chong Mar from 2007 indicate a New York state tax warrant for over $2,000.

While on the floor Mar produced a second knife and tried to cut his other wrist before he was disarmed.

'It happened really fast — and then he was down,' said 21-year-old Jossie Edwards, a tourist from Easley, South Carolina to the New York Daily News.

In fact, one witness said that security and the NYPD was so concerned about the amount of blood coming from Mar - that they eventually used their own feet to keep him at bay.

'They didn’t want to touch him,' said Edwards' mother, Kim McLeroy.

He was then promptly taken away by paramedics and no member of the Today show crew or host's were in danger of being harmed.

'I saw him take slice after slice. I saw the blood gushing,' said witness Kellie Ostransky, in town to celebrate her birthday with her twin sister.

Ostransky, who is visiting from Phoenix said that she feared a terror attack similar to the recent murder in broad daylight of a London solider might be occurring.

'The first thing I thought about was that soldier in London, and I thought, 'Oh my God, this is happening.’

As he cut himself Mar screamed out loud 'the IRS is watching me' and prior to that had been handing out flyers said Ostransky's twin sister Kimberlee to the New York Post.

'He threw the papers up because nobody was taking them. He started cutting his wrists. People were running and screaming,' said Kimberlee.

'I thought this guy might be doing a protest and kill people, and the rest of us would be trampled,' she said.

Clean Up: The scene after security had mopped up the blood and cleared the shocked audience members away

Jessica Lacy who works in Bouchon bakery in front of where the Today show is filmed said she arrived to work to find the area swamped by cops.

She said there was 'tons of blood, tons of cops.' Another employee had been watching she show being broadcast when he said he witnessed a man hacking at this wrists.

Kokou Amenouvar, 45, a tour guide from the Bronx said he arrived at work to find an ambulance and people rushing into the NBC building.

'People looked upset and police were escorting them out.' He said he wondered, 'why is he doing this?'

Another man, who would give his name only as Robert said 'a gentleman came down the street. He was carrying papers in a folder in his hand.'

'As the camera came around he cut his wrists in front of the women and children that were there.

'The women and children were screaming. Next thing, a man tackled him to the ground. Police came out of everywhere.

'He had blood on his face but they had him strapped down for a while on a stretcher before taking him away.'

'The place was in lock-down.'

The shocking incident was not shown to millions of morning viewers. 'He was in the crowd but off camera,' a police source told the New York Daily News.

Explanation: Matt Lauer and his Today co-host's inform their viewers why the outside broadcast had to be moved indoors to the studio after a man apparently tried to commit suicide during the live show

Following the shocking incident, the 
entire Today team had to abandon their 
outside broadcast and move into the studio after the man stabbed himself
 in full view of Lauer and co-host Savannah Guthrie - in his apparent 
attempt to commit suicide.

The audience was also evacuated from Rockefeller Plaza as the NYPD cordoned off and cleaned up the area.

Informing
 their viewers why they had moved indoors, a solemn Lauer said that a short time 
ago a man was tackled by the Today show's security team after he began 
to cut himself with a knife.

Lauer, 55, was clearly shaken by the harrowing incident as he spoke for his colleagues, Guthrie, Natalie Morales and Al Roker.

Speaking
 live on air just after 8 a.m. Matt Lauer thanked the NYPD for their 
swift response time to the incident and mentioned that even as the man 
was harming himself he said out-loud that he didn't want to hurt others.

'Opening the 8 o’clock half hour inside the studio today because there 
was an incident out on the plaza,' host Matt Lauer explained after the 
commercial break.

'A short time ago, a man out there attempted to harm 
himself with a knife. He did manage to cut himself.'

'He was controlled by our security team out there. However, he did harm 
himself in some way. And so he’s now being attended to by medical 
personnel.'

Lauer added that the man 'did say something about not wanting to harm others.'

Posting a message onto his Twitter feed just before 9 a.m. Lauer gave the all clear after the 'scary incident' and again thanked the Today show security team and the NYPD.

NBC News issued the following statement:

'We have strict security protocols in place to protect visitors to 
the TODAY show and those procedures were followed and effective. We are 
very grateful for the actions of our security team and the NYPD that no 
others visiting the show were harmed in the incident.'

The man was taken into custody as an emotionally disturbed person.

His physical injuries were not life-threatening. His mental condition is being evaluated at a hospital.
