A 29-year-old Florida teacher accused of sleeping with a 17-year-old student was hit with yet more charges Wednesday after a second pupil came forward with new allegations.

The second student, now 20, was also 17 in September 2011 when English teacher Jennifer Fichter started inviting him over to her apartment where they would cuddle on the couch and watch TV.

He says the relationship turned sexual the next month and they went on to have intercourse about 20 times for seven months - sometimes in the boy's bedroom while his mother was away, according to the arrest report.

Fichter was initially arrested last week 
after the mother of one of Central Florida Aerospace Academy's juniors 
found intimate text messages from the teacher on her son's phone.

More charges: English teacher Jennifer Fichter is facing 20 more counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor after a second student came forward alleging he had a relationship with her. Pictured above in court last week

Fichter was charged with six counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor last week, and was charged with 20 more counts on Wednesday after the second student's revelations. Neither teen has been identified.

Allegations: The second student says he had a relationship with Fichter in 2011, when he was just 17 years old, and that they had sex 20 or so times. The unnamed former student is now 20

The new charges come just one day after the Polk County School Board voted unanimously to fire Fichter after an investigation into the affair she had with the current student.

According to The Tampa Tribune, police said the abuse with the current student began in November when the pair had sex in the early morning hours in Fichter's Toyota pickup truck.

The teen told detectives he and Fichter met for sex three times in the parking lot of a Lakeland apartment complex and three times near New Tampa Highway.

He also said they had sex four times outside the city in Polk and Hillsborough. Lakeland police said those counties are investigating those incidents.

The illegal meetings were discovered by the teen's suspicious mother on January 27.

When she noticed her son was not home at 5am and lied about his whereabouts, she looked through his cell phone and found texts from two names. One discussed an 'age difference'.

Police said the mom confronted her son, who admitted both names were used by Fichter.

The mother reported Fichter to police, however it is not clear why she waited so long.

The mother also agreed to speak to Fichter and record the conversation for investigators.

During the call, Fichter allegedly admitted she became pregnant with the teen's child and had an abortion. Fichter also said she was in love with the student and wanted to continue seeing him.

Scene: Both students attended Central Florida Aerospace Academy where Fichter taught English. On Tuesday, the school board voted unanimously to fire her after an investigation into the relationship she admitted to having with a current junior

'The victim's mother discovered this relationship after reviewing text messages from her son and she asked that Fichter respond to her residence to talk,' a Lakeland police statement said, according to Orlando Sentinel.

'According to the victim's mother, Fichter admitted to the sexual encounters and professed her love for him.'

Fichter was arrested at her Davenport home soon after the conversation, and booked at the Polk County Jail.

And the two students at the space academy aren't the only boys Fichter is accused of abusing.

The 29-year-old resigned from her job at Robinswood Middle School in Orange County in 2008 after it was reported she had feelings for an eighth-grade student.

Fichter is now in jail after being accused of having sex with a minor as many as 30 times in the backseat of her truck

A 40 page report on the English teacher revealed that she told another teacher she had feelings for the boy, and hinted to another student that she wanted to have sex with him.

She reportedly said ‘he makes me melt into a puddle with those eyes.’

Her co-worker told investigators that she told her she even dreamed about the boy one night.

When asked what it was about, she said, ‘Oh my goodness, it was a goooood dream!’

The report said Fichte and her colleague joked that the remark could get her jailed if ever revealed.

An investigation was launched into her feelings for the 14 year old boy. No charges were ever filed against the 29 year old in the 2008 case.
