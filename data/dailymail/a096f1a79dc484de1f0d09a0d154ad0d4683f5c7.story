A guest attending a gipsy wedding was shot dead and a second man was injured outside the church during fighting before the ceremony.

Barney McGinley died in hospital from his injuries after the shooting yesterday outside St Mary’s Catholic Church in the rural village of Newtownbutler in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland.

Parish priest Father Michael King - who was inside the church when the shooting happened - has described how he pleaded for the fighting to stop, while the bride was at the back of the church.

Dramatic day: The bride and members of the wedding party leave St Mary’s Catholic Church in the rural village of Newtownbutler in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, after the service yesterday afternoon

Police at the scene: The priest said there had been an 'altercation' in the car park long before the bride arrived

Father King said there had been an ‘altercation’ in the car park long before the bride arrived, and then a ‘group of women took one side and a group of women took another side’.

He told The Irish Times journalist Gerry Moriarty: ‘The women were basically trying to get the men to stop fighting. I pleaded with them to stop and they did, but then it started again.’

Father King added: ‘The bride was standing at the back of the church waiting to come up the aisle, and the next thing there was a bit of commotion at the back of the church.

‘Several women ran in and said “there are shots, there are shots, there is somebody shooting”.’

The priest told how he went outside yesterday lunchtime and saw some men gathered around the injured pair. The police and the ambulance service were then called and the wedding went ahead.

Probe: Forensics officers searched for clues last night around the grounds of St Mary's Catholic Church

Investigation: Politicians told of a 'significant onus on police to ensure that these criminals are caught'

Father King said the wedding party had asked him for the service to take place as planned.

The priest explained: ‘They said “father, we would like you to proceed with the wedding”, so I proceeded with the wedding.

'They spent at least half an hour inside the church at the end taking photographs.’

The priest said he was ‘really shocked’ to hear of the injured man’s death later on yesterday.

There were unconfirmed reports last night that a ‘jealous lover’ went on the shooting spree targeting a man present at the church.

Mr McGinley was in his mid-60s and lived in Longford but was originally from Athlone, County Westmeath. He was flown to hospital in a police helicopter but later died from his injuries.

Location: Concern has been raised that the incident yesterday happened 'next door to a primary school'

The other victim, in his 30s, did not suffer life-threatening injuries after the incident. A third man is understood to have sustained a knife wound to his hand.

Sinn Féin councillor Thomas O’Reilly told the Irish Daily Mail that there were rumours in the town that a ‘jealous lover’ turned up at the church but he ended up missing his intended target and shooting two other men instead.

He added: ‘Everyone in the community is shocked. My condolences to the dead man’s family and all injured but this happened next door to a primary school, this is of huge concern.

‘People are arriving home from work this evening and no-one can believe what has happened. Apparently the bride was still in the church when the shooting took place,’ added Mr O’Reilly.

Possible explanation: There were unconfirmed reports that a ‘jealous lover’ went on the shooting spree

Transport: After the shooting, the victims were driven to a police station in nearby Lisnaskea in a white van 

The councillor said that St Mary’s primary school is adjacent to the church and its playground overlooks the scene.

‘This is a small, close-knit community and village here at Newtownbutler. No-one can believe that something like this could happen,’ he remarked.

The wedding party and guests travelled from Longford and Dublin in the Republic of Ireland.

Assembly member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone Tom Elliott said the attack was ‘horrific’.

‘It is very worrying that certain people have access to firearms and are willing to use them for any reason,’ he said.

‘There is a significant onus on police to ensure that these criminals are caught and that the courts ensure they are locked up for a long period.’
