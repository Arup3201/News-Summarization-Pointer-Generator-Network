An American tourist has admitted she is very lucky to be alive after a car she was driving rolled 500ft down one of Britain's steepest passes.

Jane Lukic, 60, only suffered a cut to the head, a broken arm, bruising and a slight concussion after her car somersaulted down the slope after it left the Wrynose Pass in Cumbria last week.

It is thought the she descending on a curve when a tyre blew out - causing her to lose control of the silver Mercedes and career down the ravine.

When the car stopped rolling, Mrs Lukic, born in England, was precariously hanging upside down from her seatbelt and was covered in broken glass.

But two witnesses raced to her aid down the 
mountain pass, which is full of sharp hairpin bends,and is surrounded by a drop of more than 1,000ft at certain points.

'As I rolled I just breathed into it and tried to relax as much as possible'

She is currently recovering in a hotel before she is strong enough to fly back to America.

'I'm very, very beat up but I'm very fortunate,' she said.

'I had no idea how far it was going to go. I was born in England and was very excited to come back.

'One
of the first things I thought of was, "I came back to England to 
actually die in England?"  and then I thought that was not an option.

'As I rolled I just breathed into it and tried to relax as much as possible.

'It was very noisy and very scary.

'I
ended up being suspended from the seatbelt hanging upside down and felt
glass break on to me.

'I had no idea how far I’d fallen.

'How long it was going to take someone to find me? I had no idea.

'I
was bleeding pretty heavily but I could start to hear voices in the 
distance yelling and screaming and I heard them trying to get to me.'

The accident on the steep single- track descent of the pass into the Lake District hamlet of Little Langdale could have been a tragedy.

However,
Mrs Lukic, a self-employed music instructor from Mequon, a small city 
in Wisconsin, was discharged from hospital just days later.

She was travelling to Yorkshire to visit friends when her silver Mercedes left the narrow road.

The car flipped several times down the bracken-covered slope before coming to a halt on its side.

Ex-husband Chris, speaking from Wisconsin, said ‘it’s a miracle’.

He said: 'It’s amazing. If she had been in an old-technology car, she wouldn’t be alive.

'It’s a miracle that she had her seat belt on and was able to sustain this crash with only minor injuries.

'She’s in good spirits and doing well, and happy to be alive.'

Mrs Lukic’s son, Noel Kegel, added: 
'A lifetime of gratitude and appreciation for the hiker, to the first 
responders, to the RAF chopper crew, to the doctors and everyone 
involved in this rescue effort.

'Mercedes earns a mention as well for designing a vehicle that can sustain so much damage and protect its precious cargo.'

Nick Owen, team leader of Langdale and Ambleside Mountain Rescue Team, whose ten-strong team spent three hours at the incident, reserved praise for the two young men who comforted her while emergency services were on their way.

Fire crews from Ambleside, Coniston and Kendal were involved in cutting the roof off to allow paramedics to get to Mrs Lukic, who was on her own.

Low-lying cloud meant a North West Air Ambulance Service helicopter had to turn back and instead an RAF Sea King helicopter from Northumberland evacuated the woman to Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary.

She was treated there over the weekend before being released on Monday, the hospital confirmed.Martin Holroyd, of Cumbria Fire and Rescue, said: 'It was a lucky escape. She was very fortunate.'

Wrynose Pass is a popular destination for walkers who are visiting the Lake District.

But the height of the routes and the potential risk means they are sometimes required to stick to designated tarmac paths.
