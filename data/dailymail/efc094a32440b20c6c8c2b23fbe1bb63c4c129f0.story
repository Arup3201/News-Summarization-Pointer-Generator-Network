Free: Matthew VanDyke has escaped a prison in Libya where he was held, his mother said

A U.S. writer who had been held captive in Libya after being captured in the early months of the conflict has escaped from prison, his mother said.

Matthew VanDyke, 32, travelled from his home in Maryland after seeing the battles unfold on TV when unrest began in February.

He was captured and held in solitary confinement in Abu Salim prison in Tripoli with his relatives at home fearing that he might not be released.

The notorious prison was the scene of a massacre in 1996 when 1,270 prisoners were claimed to have been killed after guards opened fire on them on them with machine guns.

But Mr VanDyke's mother, Sharon, said her son called her on a borrowed phone after being helped to escape by fellow prisoners.

'He was in the cell and heard men coming. He thought they were coming to execute or torture him,' Sharon VanDyke told CNN.

But the men smashed open the door and invited the fearful prisoner out of the building and took him to the home of a wealthy man. He is currently being looked after there.

'He had a great respect for the people and the country, not the politics. I've always known he was OK.'

'He said he was in good physical health He was sorry we did not know for sure he was OK.'

Mrs VanDyke  said that her son was freed alongside six other U.S. civillians who had been held in the prison.

Mr VanDyke, a freelance journalist, first travelled to Libya on a six-week trip in 2008. While there he made friends with locals. He wanted to return to the country when he saw the trouble erupting earlier this year.

But VanDyke disappeared after telling his mother and Fischer that he'd take a daytrip to the eastern Libyan oil town of Brega from Benghazi in mid-March.

Initially, Libyan officials denied that VanDyke was being held, but they acknowledged during talks with Hungarian officials late last month that he was in custody.

U.S. State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland confirmed that all U.S. citizens who were known to be detained in Libya have been released.

She added: 'The families of those detained individuals have been notified of their freedom and welfare.

'We remain concerned about the welfare and safety of those U.S. citizens who remain in Tripoli. For safety and privacy reasons we are unable to provide additional details.'

News that Mr Van Dyke had been freed came as suspected regime loyalists kidnapped four Italian journalists and killed their local driver in Libya as the group traveled down a highway to Tripoli on Wednesday.

The Italian foreign ministry said the four were abducted on a stretch of highway between Zawiya, a town 30 miles west of Tripoli, and the Libyan capital.

The kidnapped reporters included two reporters from Milan daily Corriere della Sera, one from Turin's La Stampa and one from Avvenire, the daily of the Italian Catholic bishops Conference, the ministry said.

Information also emerged on Wednesday that two French journalists were wounded in the fighting around Moammar Gadhafi's compound in Tripoli.

Corriere della Sera said on its website that the four Italian journalists were stopped by a group of civilians, who then 'handed them over to military men faithful to Gaddafi who brought them to a private house,' and that first contact from the Avvenire journalist came hours later.

Avvenire's foreign news editor, Fabio Carminati, said its reporter, Claudio Monici, called to say all four journalists were OK and had been taken to a house.

'Monici said ''We're OK. Call our families. Call the foreign ministry. Call our papers'',' Carminati said, adding that Monici's voice sounded strong.

Carminati added: 'Monici told us ''We were roughed up, they stole our possessions, our money, our phones''.'

The Italian journalists have now been released.

Fighting around Tripoli erupted yesterday, hours after the dictator who ruled Libya with an iron fist for 42 years vowed to fight on ‘until victory or martyrdom’ and called on Tripoli’s residents to free the city from the ‘devils and traitors’.

An an address from an unknown location and broadcast on the pro-Gaddafi Al-Ouroba TV, the ousted despot asked: ‘Why are you letting them wreak havoc?’

Sounding subdued and without his usually fiery rhetoric, he made no reference to the storming of his compound, stressing he would fight ‘the aggression with all strength until either victory or death’.

Much of the latest fighting was centred in the neighbourhood of Abu Salim, near the Gaddafi compound and home to a notorious prison. Fierce fighting also raged in the area of the Rixos Hotel, close to the seized compound, where 35 journalists are effectively hostages of the regime.

The rebels are now using Bab al-Aziziya as a staging area for their operations, loading huge trucks with ammunition and discussing where they need to deploy despite coming under fire from rifles and rocket propelled grenades.

Rebels claimed to be in control of 95 per cent of Libya and 90 per cent of Tripoli last night and declared Gaddafi’s rule effectively over. Abdul Ati al-Obeidi, Gaddafi’s former foreign minister, said the regime had come to an end and rebels were now responsible for restoring law and order to Libya.

Crucially, rebel chiefs made their first moves to set up a new government in the capital.

‘Members of the council are moving one by one from Benghazi to Tripoli,’ said Mansour Seyf al-Nasr, the Libyan opposition’s new ambassador to France.
