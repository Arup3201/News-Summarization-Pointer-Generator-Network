Mountains of rubbish are piling up in the Spanish city of Seville after a strike by binmen reached its tenth day.

Rubbish collectors are protesting at proposed cuts to their working conditions as the Andalusian city's municipal government battles to balance its books. So far around 6,000 tons of rubbish have been left uncollected since the strike started.

It started when the management of Lipasam, Seville's municipal street cleaning company, rejected a plan by the city council to reduce the garbage collectors' wages by five per cent while increasing their working hours.

Sixteen hundred workers walked out leaving the rubbish to clog up the narrow streets of the capital of Andalusia.

Over the past three months, similar 
strikes by garbage collectors also occurred in Jérez de la Frontera and 
Granada, two of Andalusia’s other large tourist cities.

'It's clear that striking can have a 
much larger impact when it concerns something as visible to citizens as 
garbage,' said Ángel Gallego Morales, the president of the economic and 
social council of Andalusia, the regional body that oversees relations 
among the government, companies and unions.

'We can only hope that this will soon end, even if there is no sign of any willingness to compromise right now.'

More recently, the garbage problem 
has even taken on a criminal dimension, as containers have been set on 
fire. The fires have occurred mostly in the city's southern districts, 
far from the historic downtown, the New York Times reported.

Antonio Bazo, the president of the 
workers' committee of Lipasam, condemned the fires as criminal acts of 
delinquency and denied that employees of his company were responsible 
for any of them.

'We're not burning containers because
 what we want is exactly the opposite, which is that the rubbish be seen
 in the streets,' Mr. Bazo told the Europa Press news agency.

Under Spanish employment law, Lipasam
 has to guarantee that 30 per cent of the normal quantity of garbage is 
collected even during a strike, particularly around hygiene-sensitive 
areas like hospitals and slaughterhouses.

City officials have also ensured that waste does not pile up around Seville's cathedral, the city's main tourist draw.

However, rubbish containers are 
already overflowing in some of the other popular parts of the city, 
including around the Alameda Square.

Spain welcomed 57.9 million foreign 
tourists last year, three per cent more than in 2011 and close to the 
record 58.7 million visitors in 2007, before the financial crisis and 
the bursting of Spain's construction bubble.

Tourism has been one of the few sectors of Spain's economy to emerge relatively unscathed from the crisis.

Spain’s Prime Minister is facing increasing calls to quit as a corruption scandal engulfs his government.

Mariano Rajoy is fighting for his political future after El Pais newspaper claimed the Popular Party leader received secret annual payments averaging €25,000 (£22,000) between 1997 and 2008.

The cash allegedly came from a slush fund, run by former party treasurer Luis Barcenas, who reportedly received millions of Euros in illegal payments from firms bidding for contracts.

It is an allegation Rajoy strenuously denies. Protesters yesterday jeered at Barcenas as he left prosecutors’ offices where he was questioned. 

People shouted 'thief' and 'give the money back' at Luis Barcenas as he left the anti-corruption prosecutors’ office Wednesday. 

The story has unnerved financial markets - with investors worried that a change in leadership would render Spain unable to address its considerable debts.

This had led to the Government’s borrowing costs being pushed back up at a time when it is trying to save money and pay off its debts to avoid bankruptcy.

As the 17-nation eurozone’s fourth largest economy, Spain is seen as being too large to bail out - unlike the smaller economies of Greece, Portugal and Ireland.

Therefore, analysts fear a failure to pay off its debts could collapse the eurozone as a whole.

The allegations have also sparked further civil unrest in the country with Spaniards, already bitter over enduring the painful austerity measures, taking to the streets in their thousands to show their anger.

Protests against Rajoy at the weekend in Madrid, Barcelona and Seville turned violent as clashes erupted with police.

A petition calling for Rajoy’s resignation has been signed by more than 900,000 people, and opinion polls claim a staggering 85 per cent of the nation now has ‘little faith’ in him.

It comes as unemployment figures rose again to 26 per cent this week, with an astonishing 55 per cent of young people out of work, and experts predict that worse is yet to come.

Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, leader of the socialist opposition, has joined in the calls for Rajoy, who was elected in 2011, to quit for the ‘good of the country’.

He said: ‘Rather than the solution for this country, Rajoy has become yet another problem. He should give up his role as the head of the government and cede his place to another leader because he cannot tackle the very difficult situation confronting Spain.’

The scandal first erupted last week when El Pais published what it claims were handwritten excerpts from Barcenas’ accounting books.

They appear to show a regular distribution of under-the-table cash payments to a host of senior party members, including Rajoy.

Rajoy, speaking on Saturday, categorically denied the claims by saying ‘I have never received nor distributed undeclared money’ and promised to publish details of his income online.

Sources close to the leadership claim Rajoy has been a victim of a ‘smear campaign’ and that the documents had been doctored. 

The PP has also revealed it will take legal action, but its exact nature has not yet been disclosed.

Barcenas, who is under separate investigation after it was revealed he had amassed €29million(£25million) in a secret Swiss bank account, also denies the claims.
