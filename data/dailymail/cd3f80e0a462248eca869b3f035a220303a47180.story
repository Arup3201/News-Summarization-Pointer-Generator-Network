Radical plan: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne could give away shares of the state's stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland

Everyone in Britain could be given Royal Bank of Scotland shares worth hundreds of pounds before the next election, under plans being considered by George Osborne.

Senior sources say the Chancellor has decided to offload the State’s 82 per cent stake in the bank before 2015.

And Tory ministers believe the most radical solution – simply giving the shares away – has huge political benefits.

It would pump more than £30billion into the economy, providing a much-needed boost without the need for pre-election tax cuts.

The plan, which is being explored by Sajid Javid, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, would mean a share voucher being sent to everyone with a National Insurance number, or possibly even everyone over the age of 18.

Treasury sources say the handout could be worth around £400, but  it might be worth as much as double that.

The giveaway could be announced as soon as this year, with bank shares offloaded in 2014.

Voters would receive their windfall by January 2015 at the latest.

An alternative plan would see the shares sold to taxpayers at a discount, in a reprise of the sell-offs of public utilities pioneered by the Conservatives under Margaret Thatcher.

The previous government spent £45billion of taxpayers’ money on propping up RBS in 2008. Senior Treasury sources say the Chancellor has abandoned hope of recouping all the costs, with the Government’s shares currently worth just £31billion.

However, as this loss has already been factored into the UK’s credit rating, officials believe that giving away the shares would not undermine the Government’s general economic strategy.

Business Secretary Vince Cable 
proposed a share giveaway in a speech earlier this month in which he 
said any hope of privatising the bank at a profit looked like a 
‘distant’ dream.

But the revelation that Mr Osborne and Mr Javid are taking the plan seriously will surprise the City.

At the helm: Stephen Hester, Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive, has told insiders that he will clear most of the bank's toxic assets by 2014

‘George has taken the view that he 
now wants to get this sorted out before the election,’ a senior figure 
said. ‘He has given Sajid pretty wide latitude to sort this out.

‘There
is a realisation that there is no prospect of RBS’s share price rising 
to the level at which we bailed the bank out, and it’s not good for the 
bank or the Government to hold on to our stake indefinitely.

‘Obviously a giveaway to taxpayers before the election, who after all paid for it in the first place, is very attractive.’

A Tory source said: ‘One of the 
options of course could be to put it in our manifesto – but then Labour 
could do that as well. Wouldn’t it be much better if voters were getting
a cheque for £400 a few months before election day? It would also be a 
very big stimulus.’ 

Allies
say Mr Osborne has decided he wants to offload the shares due to 
frustration at the Government being dragged into a succession of 
scandals such as Libor rigging and bankers’ bonuses.

Insiders say 
Treasury ministers are spending a ‘disproportionate amount of time’ 
dealing with these issues.

‘What
people don’t understand is that even though we own over 80 per cent of 
the bank we can’t just tell them what to do,’ said one. ‘Our only real 
power is to sack the whole board, and that wouldn’t exactly inspire 
market confidence.’

The Treasury plan has been strengthened by growing confidence that RBS will be ready to sell as early as next year.

Chief executive Stephen Hester has told industry insiders that the bank will have cleared most of the toxic assets from its balance sheet by spring 2014.

However, experts believe the most likely scenario would see the Government sell a tranche of shares at a loss with the aim of boosting the share price, to give it a better chance of recouping its money by selling the rest.

Although he plans to sell the RBS stake, Mr Osborne has no immediate plans to offload the Government’s 40 per cent slice of Lloyds. This is because the bank concentrates on high street business rather than controversial investments.
