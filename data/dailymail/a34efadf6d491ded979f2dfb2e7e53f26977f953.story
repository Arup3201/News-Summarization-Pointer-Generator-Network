Liverpool's opening friendly of the summer ended in defeat in Denmark on the day their relationship with Luis Suarez officially ended.

As Barcelona spoke about signing Suarez for the first time since releasing a statement last Friday that they had agreed a £75million fee for him, Brendan Rodgers was overseeing a workout in Brondby for a squad that was high on enthusiasm but low on experience.

Rodgers’ were beaten 2-1 by a last minute goal in the Brondby Stadion, a result that was joyously received by locals – “we’ve never lost to Liverpool!” they sang at the final whistle – but it is not a result Rodgers will read anything in to.

None of his four new signings featured
 nor did any of the Liverpool players who have been on duty at the World
 Cup; this was simply an exercise to give a number of the younger 
members of his squad a run-out alongside established players such as 
Daniel Agger, Martin Skrtel and Lucas Leiva.

Pre-season
 matches used to be sedate affairs played out in relaxed atmospheres but
 the way football has changed was never more apparent than the greeting 
that was reserved for the two teams as they made their way onto the 
pitch.

With the Van Halen 
hit ‘Jump’ blasting through the speakers, the Brondby Stadium was full 
to capacity and awash with a sea of yellow and blue shirts at one end 
and red and white ones at the other; this was a scene you would expect 
for a European game, not a glorified training session.

Given
 the following they enjoy in Scandinavia, Liverpool were always 
guaranteed to receive a warm ovation and special acclaim was reserved 
for Daniel Agger, who moved to Anfield from Brondby in January 2006. He 
remains an icon in these parts.

Agger,
 fittingly, captained Liverpool in the first half and he almost gave the
 home supporters what they wanted in the 28th minute but, after 
exchanging passes with Philippe Coutinho following a surging run from 
his own half, his shot was saved by Brondby goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky.

Liverpool
 were behind at that point, trailing to a goal from Christian Norgaard. 
The midfielder had seized upon a mistake by Liverpool substitute Kevin 
Stewart, making his debut after joining from Tottenham, to sweep a drive
 past Brad Jones from 22 yards.

Rodgers’
 side finished the first period strongest and Hradecky impressed with 
how he kept Liverpool at bay, making a smart double stop from Brad Smith
 and Philippe Coutinho on 31 minutes before denying Lucas and taking a 
chance of Fabio Borini’s toe in stoppage time.

Predictably,
 wholesale changes were made during the interval but Liverpool were soon
 level and the goal owed much to the speed and skill of young winger 
Jordon Ibe, who raced down the left flank to square for another novice 
forward, Kristoffer Peterson, who tapped in from six yards.

Though
 the tempo of the game dropped in the late evening sun, chances were 
limited but Brondby looked the most likely to find a breakthrough and 
came close in the 65th minute when Riza Durmisi cracked the crossbar 
with a dipping free-kick.

Ultimately,
 however, Brondby found a way through in added time when another 
substitute Ferhan Hasani took advantage of some generous Liverpool 
defending – tackling was non-existent at this early stage of the 
campaign – to slot in from 12 yards.
