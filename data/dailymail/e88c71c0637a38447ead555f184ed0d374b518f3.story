Despite being on the rental market, it is highly likely the vast majority of students and young professionals won't be able to afford this property.

The Woolworth Mansion - once dubbed New York's most expensive house -  is now available to rent for an astonishing $150,000 a month.

But despite the monthly fee being something of an eye opener, there are plenty of features to the house to keep tenants entertained.

The extraordinary property in Manhattan’s opulent Upper East Side boasts an incredible ten bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, three kitchens, a wood-panelled library, an elevator, a gym and a garden.

The 18,000-square feet home is also ideal for a good old-fashioned dinner party, as it includes a dining room which seats more than 50 people.

The French Gothic mansion was built in 1916 by dime store magnate Frank Winfield Woolworth for his daughter, Helena.

He also built two other mansions on 
the street for his other daughters Edna and Jessie, which the Woolworth 
Mansion is nestled between.

Speaking to the New York Daily News, broker Paula Del Nunzio, said: 'It’s a miracle this house survived with so much of the original details intact.

'The owners … not only restored that original details they found but also renovated the mansion with all modern systems. This house is a prime example of "architecture as art" and there is always a market for that.'

The property was on the market for sale last year. With a whopping price tag of $90million (£56million), it was unsurprisingly dubbed New York's most expensive house.

The mansion, which at 35ft wide has been completely renovated into a pre-war style, was bought in 1995 for a mere $6million (£3.7million) by the late gym magnate Lucille Roberts, when it was used as a men's gym.

The mansions built by Woolworth were all constructed by the architect Charles Pierpont Henry Gilbert who designed city and country homes for the wealthy.

Speaking when the house was for sale, Ms Del Nunzio said: ‘Completed in 1916, the imposing limestone façade of this neo-French Renaissance mansion features a central foyer opening to a grand entry hall providing access to the main residence.

‘With a massive fireplace, the enormous entry includes three closets and an elegant powder room, access to a kitchen in the rear as well as the wide landing of the grand master staircase.’
