The grandfather of Alecia Pennington — the 19-year-old girl who 'doesn't exist' — has told Daily Mail Online how he dramatically rescued her from the clutches of her fundamentalist Christian parents.

It happened on a regular Wednesday visit for Jim Southworth to see his daughter's family, he said in an exclusive interview at his home in Georgetown, Texas.

But since that day in September last year, Jim and his wife — also called Alecia — have had no contact with their daughter and her family.

'How could I not have done it?' Southworth asked. 'She is my granddaughter.'

The 19-year-old is therefore unable to show proof of her identity, and cannot get a birth certificate

Alecia has gone public with her story this week, saying she can't get a job, board a plane, get a driver's license, vote or do any number of everyday tasks that the rest of America takes for granted, because there is no public record of her existence.

She was born at home in Texas and her birth was never registered. She was home-schooled and has never required hospital treatment, her grandfather confirmed.

After a week-long standoff with her parents, her father, accountant James Pennington, has now agreed to try to help her get proper documentation to prove that she is who she says she is, Alecia revealed on Friday on her Facebook page.

Jim Southworth, 71, said his granddaughter had texted him before he and his wife went to visit his daughter Lisa Pennington, her husband and their nine children in Kerrville, Texas last year.

'She said she was coming home with us. I texted her back saying she had to speak to her mother about that,' he said.

After the day-long visit on September 24, Southworth found Alecia — the fourth of the Penningtons' nine children — in his car with her belongings.

'I told her she had to get out,' he said. 'She was 18 at the time and an adult, but I didn't want to be accused of kidnapping.

'But she was adamant and said she wanted to leave with us. I said we should pray on it overnight, but she insisted she wouldn't get out. I told her she had to speak to her mother and my wife and I got out the car so they could talk it over.'

But Lisa Pennington failed to persuade her daughter to stay, said Southworth, and she remained in the car.

'Eventually I told my son-in-law I had to take her, she is my grandchild and that is what she wanted. He said, 'Fine, but you are not welcome back here again.'

'Since that day I have not spoken to my daughter or to my other grandchildren.' However, he said Alecia has kept in contact with her siblings with regular phone calls.

Southworth said Alecia is doing fine in her new life and is helping a local family as a nanny until she can get proper documentation so she can get a real job.

He said that even before the day she left he could sense friction between Alecia and her parents — whom he described as 'living off the grid.'

Alecia's story has gripped the public's imagination since she revealed her plight on Facebook and YouTube, using the handle 'Help Me Prove It.'

On YouTube  the teenager faces the camera and says calmly: 'My name is Alecia Faith Pennington and I am a U.S. citizen by birth.

'However, I was born at home,' she continues. 'And my parents neglected to file a birth certificate or birth record of any kind. They also never got me a Social Security number.

'I was home-schooled my entire life so I have no school records. I have also never been to the hospital so I have no medical records. This leaves me with nothing to prove my identity or citizenship.

'I am now 19 years old and I am unable to get a driver's licence, get a job, go to college, get on a plane, get a bank account or vote.'

She said she has contacted authorities who have no record of her birth and a judge in the county she was born had refused to issue a delayed birth certificate because she had insufficient proof of her identity.

'But that's all the proof I have,' said Alecia. 'I didn't pick this situation for myself, I just have to deal with the consequences and I don't know how to fix it — I don't know how to get out of this.

'I want to travel, I want to get an education, I want to just be a functioning American,' she adds in the 92-second video, which her grandfather said he did not know she was making. 'But I can't until I can prove citizenship.

Her mother Lisa, 49, runs a blog called The Pennington Point. She has posted her own version of Alecia's leaving, but has often removed her stories within minutes.

In one post, she said: 'On Wednesday, September 24th my life was changed forever. My 18 year old daughter left home. She gave us no warning, no signs that it was coming. She didn't try to talk to us about it or work with us. She, with the help of my parents, just left. And with her she took pieces of my heart that had been torn to shreds.'

In another she said Alecia had been helped by 'a godless woman who has been giving her foolish counsel and encouraging her to deceive and get out.'

She added: 'Believe me, James and I are all too aware that we are not innocent in this. We played a part in this problem. 

'We made mistakes and we have apologized to her, genuinely repented and are asking the Holy Spirit to guide us through this. It feels impossible to think rationally so we have sought counsel from men who give us Scripture to build us up. 

Alecia is one of nine children (above with their father), and left her home last September, with the help of her grandparents on her mother's side

'We are taking each step carefully and trying to hold on to the One who knows us better than we know ourselves. I don't want to paint myself as perfect here. I am as imperfect as I can imagine anyone being.'

More recently she wrote how she and her family are 'pulling ourselves together' following Alecia's departure.

'We have been making an effort to find our new normal without her. It has been really hard and we all miss her terribly, but I have learned a lot about how to deal with grief.

'I definitely have days when I feel like I can hardly breathe and just cry for no reason. Like, hard crying. I know that's part of the process. Oh, those crazy stages of grief.'

On Friday Alecia said on her Facebook page that her father had now said he would help her prove she is who she says she is. 'I have some wonderful news! My father has begun cooperating with us! He states he is willing to sign any documents, and give me any information he has concerning what I may need as proof.'

She then asked her followers 'not to post demeaning comments about my parents. Even though I do not agree with them on many things, I would like their reputation to be protected as much as possible.'

She also revealed that she has found an attorney who is willing to help her and set out the steps she has already taken to prove her identity. 

Among the documents she has managed to collect are a statement from a doctor who said he saw her when she was aged 9, a 2005 statement of Baptism from the Fredericksburg Christian Fellowship that does not give a date of birth, and a notarized document concerning the family's change of their last name from Sublett to Pennington from 2014.
