Bayern Munich's CEO, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, has said that Xherdan Shaqiri will not be sold this summer, but did admit clubs had enquired about him.

The 22-year-old has struggled to hold down a regular place in Bayern's team, starting just 10 games all season, but Rummenigge insisted he has a role to play in Bavaria.

'We've had several enquiries from teams in England and Italy,' he said.

'I've never had a conversation (with Shaqiri) because we are convinced he will have a good career with us. 

Transfer: Bayern Munich's CEO, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge says Xherdan Shaqiri will not be sold this summer

Competition: The Switzerland international has had his options limited by Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben 

'He must stay healthy, (but) the coach is convinced by him.' 

Liverpool had been strongly linked with the Switzerland international as Brendan Rodgers looked to spend some of the £75million the club received for Luis Suarez.

But they, and others, will now have to look elsewhere after Rummenigge's statement. 

Bayern's chief insisted that manager Pep Guardiola was happy with the squad at his disposal, indicating the German champions have finished their transfer business for the summer. 

He said: 'We have a good team. Pep wants 18 top players and five or six talents.

'He is very happy with his squad, he does not want unhappy players sitting in the stands.'

Signings: Bayern have signed Robert Lewandowski, Pepe Reina, Juan Bernat and Sebastian Rode this summer
