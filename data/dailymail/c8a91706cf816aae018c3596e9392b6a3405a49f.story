Michele Bachmann has ended her run for the White House after a disastrous 
sixth-place showing in Iowa early this morning that saw her campaign 
collapse in the state where it began six months ago.

'I am not motivated in this quest by vain glory or political power,' the Minnesota Representative said. Last night the people of Iowa spoke with a very clear voice and so I have decided to stand aside.'

She added that she decided to run for the presidency in March 2010 after being 'deeply troubled by the state of our country' when President Obama's healthcare reforms, or 'Obamacare', were passed.

'The evening that Obamacare was 
passed, I believed firmly what Congress and Obama had done endangered 
the very survival of the United States of America.

'2012 is our last chance and our only chance to repeal Obamacare. It violates our fundamental liberties as Americans (and) must be stopped. I'll fight for this country.

'I wanted my children and all the 
children of this country to live free and have even better opportunities
than our parents gave us. I decided to stand up and fight for freedom.

'Our country is in very serious 
trouble and this might be the last election to turn the nation around 
before we go down the road of socialism.'

In the days leading up to the caucuses, 
Mrs Bachmann deflected numerous questions about her staying power. But 
after the vote, even her campaign manager suggested she might leave the 
race.

Asked if he could say with certainty 
whether she would go forward with her candidacy, Keith Nahigian admitted on Tuesady night: 'I
don't know yet. It's hard to tell, but everything is planned'.

Mrs Bachmann, however, did not give up
after the results on Tuesday night, telling supporters: 'I believe I am 
that true conservative that can and who will defeat Barack Obama in 
2012'.

Her rival Rick Perry cancelled his trip to 
South Carolina last night. She emerged as an early favourite among the GOP field when she won the Iowa straw poll in August.

That victory was seen as a display of the Bachmann campaign's strength as the election season went full swing.

But Mrs Bachmann's momentum declined amid
some sleepy debate performances and she found herself upstaged by the 
likes of Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich.

As
Rick Santorum and Mr Romney seesawed between first and second place, 
Mrs Bachmann plummeted to the bottom tier among her Republican rivals in her
home state.

Party: Michele Bachmann still seemed to enjoy the evening and was seen dancing with her husband Marcus

In a last-ditch effort to collect 
votes before the caucuses began last night, Mrs Bachmann campaigned near her
childhood home of Waterloo, Iowa, to make an appeal for support.

She implored voters to 'reclaim our country.'

Mrs Bachmann's mother joined her on stage as the candidate spoke at a cavernous college sports arena that serves as a caucus hub. 

She said: 'Stand up, Iowa. Reclaim our country. Tonight we begin the process of taking it back.'

As Mrs Bachmann made her way around the 
arena, she shook hands and talked to voters about elementary school 
teachers they had in common. 

She touted herself as a 'consistent conservative' while playing up her win in the Iowa GOP's summer straw poll.

But as the Iowa votes were tallied, it became evident that the so-called 'queen of rage' may be losing her step, as rumours swirled over whether or not she would continue.

The caucus site was hardly unified.

Mrs Bachmann needed more than hometown connections to pull back into contention.

'I feel sorry for her,' said Randy Herod, a retired business consultant. 'She's real nice, but this isn't her time.'

That statement was echoed yesterday by former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who urged Mrs Bachmann to call it quits.

'She has a lot to offer, also, but I don't think it is her time this go-around,' Mrs Palin told Fox News.

'Not her time': Sarah Palin said it was probably time for Mrs Bachmann to end her campaign and endorse someone else
