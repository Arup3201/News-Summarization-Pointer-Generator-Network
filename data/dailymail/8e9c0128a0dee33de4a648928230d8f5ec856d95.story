Two-hour trial: Dissident writer Chen Wei

A Chinese court has jailed a writer for nine years for inciting subversion after publishing four essays online.

Chen Wei had called for freedom of speech and reform of the country's one-party political system.

He was among hundreds of dissidents arrested last February after online calls for protests in China inspired by the uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa.

His trial behind closed doors in the city of Suining in southwestern China, lasted about two hours and the verdict was announced 30 minutes later.

The sentence is believed to be one of
the most severe imposed on those involved in the so-called Jasmine 
Revolution - the attempt to replicate the Arab Spring uprising in China.

After the verdict, Mr Chen told the court: 'Dictatorship will fail, democracy will prevail,' according to his lawyer Zheng Jianwei.

The trial was the first time Chen's wife,
Wang Xiaoyan, had seen her husband since he was detained and said he had aged a lot.

She added: 'I think today's trial is 
just a show. It's a performance. The verdict had been decided in 
advance. They don't allow people to speak. There is no freedom of 
speech.'

She said his essays had been misinterpreted their meaning distorted, and he had done nothing to incite subversion.

'What's wrong with a person freely expressing his ideas?' said Mrs Wang. 'He is a very patriotic man.'

She told the BBC her husband would not appeal the sentence and added: 'We have a daughter who is not even 10 years old. I need to slowly explain why her father is in jail.'

Mr Chen, 42, has previously served five years for participating in the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing, where he was attending college In 1994.

Wang Songlian, a researcher with Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a Hong Kong-based advocacy group, condemned the government's crackdown.

She said: 'This severe punishment against an activist caught up in the Jasmine crackdown shows how the Chinese government's nerves are still jittery.

'All its latest moves, its attempts to control its microblogs, its crackdown on activists, show it is increasing tightening freedom of expression and other civil liberties.'

Others rounded up in this year's crackdown who have been punished include Beijing activist Wang Lihong, who was sentenced to nine months in September for staging a protest on behalf of other activists, and Yang Qiuyu, a Beijing activist who was sentenced to two years of re-education through labour.

China's Communist leadership, which does not tolerate any perceived challenge to one-party rule, was spooked early this year when anonymous online messages called for a Chinese 'Jasmine Revolution' - the name of the uprising in Tunisia.

Even though few outright demonstrators responded to the protest calls, China launched one of its broadest campaigns of repression in years, rounding up dozens of bloggers, lawyers and intellectuals. Most have since been released.

Amnesty International said Chen's sentence was only the latest case of the government's use of the vague charge of inciting subversion against its political critics.

'It's heartbreaking news and clearly retaliation for Chen Wei's peaceful critique of the Chinese Communist Party,' said Catherine Baber, Amnesty International's deputy director for Asia.

'Chen Wei is a prisoner of conscience and should be released immediately.'

Others jailed in recent years on the same charge include Chinese dissident and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, for 11 years, and veteran activist Liu Xianbin, for 10 years.
