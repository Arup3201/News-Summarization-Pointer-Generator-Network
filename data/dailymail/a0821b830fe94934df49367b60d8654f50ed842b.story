Philip Hammond has questioned David Cameron’s desire to enshrine in law a pledge to spend billions of pounds in foreign aid.

Speaking on a trip to ebola-stricken Sierra Leone, the Foreign Secretary said yesterday he saw no reason to pass a law that says 0.7 per cent of Britain’s national income has to go on aid ‘because we have met it already’.

His remarks appear to be the final nail in the coffin for Mr Cameron’s vow to put the commitment on the statute in this Parliament.

Philip Hammond has questioned David Cameron’s desire to enshrine in law a pledge to spend billions of pounds in foreign aid

Such legislation was part of the Coalition agreement, but has repeatedly been put off.

Mr Hammond said: ‘It’s a bizarre idea. Somebody says “shall we have a law that says you’ve got to build a building?”

‘Think about it – in the meantime we build a building. Someone comes along and says “now we’ve built it shall we pass the law which says we’ve got to do it”? We’ve done it. We’re doing it. You don’t need a law to say we’re doing it.’

Mr Hammond said the work the UK was doing to prevent the spread of ebola in West Africa proved why international aid was so important and how it is in the UK’s best interests to spend so much money on it.

But he conceded that much of the public was ‘sceptical’ about the value of aid – especially when it was spent on long-term economic and education programmes in countries such as India which could afford a space programme.

And he admitted millions of pounds handed out by the Department for International Development are wasted every year because of corruption in recipient countries.

Mr Hammond was speaking on a visit to Sierra Leone, one of the three West African countries where ebola has taken hold. He visited a medical centre being built with UK aid money at Port Loko in the west of the country.

And, on a visit to the national stadium in the capital, Freetown, he saw people from Sierra Leone being taught how to treat ebola sufferers. Britain has pledged £230million to Sierra Leone to help it tackle ebola, and more than 800 troops are stationed there. So far, 5,224 cases of ebola have been reported in the country, with 1,498 deaths.

Mr Hammond said he hoped trials of an anti-ebola vaccine could start by early next month.

The Foreign Secretary said of the ebola effort: ‘This is a classic example of how our aid spending is deployed in our own interest.

‘First – getting this epidemic under control in West Africa is in our interests.

‘We’ve got significant economic interests in West Africa, we’ve got significant numbers of people travelling between West Africa and the UK, we’ve got significant numbers of British citizens and residents with connections in West Africa – so from purely a self-interest point of view we need to sort this out.

‘But it’s also clear that if it had just been left, we would have had a million, million and a half cases by early next year – and inevitably the larger the pool or cases, the greater the number that will turn up in Western Europe, North America, so the risk of infection spreading. It’s very much in our interest.’

But he admitted there was ‘scepticism’ among the British public about the value of much of our aid – and that there were ‘ongoing challenges’ in persuading people much of it does good. ‘The scepticism that some people will have about the aid budget, which I absolutely recognise, I don’t think has ever been directed at emergency aid,’ he said.

‘I’ve never detected in Britain people saying we shouldn’t be sending food aid, or disaster relief or earthquake relief.

Mr Hammond said that, for this reason, the UK had made disaster relief the top priority, and would cut other forms of aid if need be.

He also admitted that a lot of British aid money was ‘siphoned’ off thanks to corruption. He said: ‘In countries that are corrupt, and that’s a lot of countries including some of the poorest countries in the world, some of everything gets siphoned off in corruption and the aid budget isn’t excepted.

‘If you’re doing any kind of business, including aid-related business, in countries like many African countries and countries like Afghanistan, inevitably because the system is so corrupt, some of it going to get caught up in that.

‘Part of what we’re trying to do is deal with endemic corruption.’
