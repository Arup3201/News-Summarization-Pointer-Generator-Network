A 'true West Country boy' who could drink up to 15 pints of cider on a typical night out has shed 11 stone by ditching alcohol.

Facing divorce at the same time as he was made redundant from his job, Mitch Jones turned to food and alcohol for comfort.

But the gorging on takeaways and his favourite tipple took its toll, and in three months Mr Jones's weight spiralled from 16 stone to his heaviest point, 22 stone 6lb.

The turning point came in 2011 when he was out shopping for new clothes to wear to his new girlfriend's 30th birthday party.

Mitch Jones, from Burnham-on-Sea in Somerset, lost a staggering 11 stone after ditching his 15 pints of cider a night binge drinking habit. Mr Jones, pictured left at his heaviest holding a pint of cider, and right, now

Mr Jones hit rock bottom in 2006 when his marriage ended and he discovered he was to be made redundant from his job. Turning to food and alcohol for comfort, his weight spiralled from 16 stone to 22 stone 6lbs in just three months

Catching a glimpse of himself in the changing room mirror, Mr Jones vowed to make a change to his lifestyle.

He ditched the fatty foods, abandoning his habitual trips to the pub and takeaway, in favour of a calorie-controlled diet and active lifestyle.

Today the 39-year-old said he wants to change perceptions of dieting, which can discourage men from taking responsibility for their weight and health.

Mr Jones, from Burnham-on-Sea in Somerset, said: 'It’s not "cool" to diet, unfortunately. For some reason it’s seen as unmanly.

'But it’s alright for guys to step forward and take control of their weight.

'Struggles with being overweight can have just as much of an emotional impact for men as they do for women.'

Mr Jones hit rock bottom in the autumn of 2006.

He said: 'My marriage came to end and I was made redundant, which was a huge double blow. It was a very painful time.

'I was around 16 stone and had been told that the fact I was unattractive had led to the end of the marriage.

'In my mind, I decided that I would continue to be unhealthy. If I was unattractive, then I would be less likely to find a new partner, which would protect me from the possibility of going through the end of another relationship.

But in 2011 the turning point came when Mr Jones was shopping for new clothes and caught sight of himself in the mirror. He vowed to shed the weight and take control of his lifestyle

'A lot of people lose weight when their relationships come to an end, but for me it was the opposite.'

Three months later Mr Jones hit his heaviest weight , tipping the scales at 22st 6lb - and measuring 52 inches around his waist.

He said: 'Drink was a big thing for me. I never drank alone - it was always social thing.

'As a teenager I’d got it into my head that the lads would be impressed if I could down a big bottle of White Lightning and still stand at the end.

'Being a true Westcountry boy, I would drink 15 pints of cider without even thinking... I must have been consuming more than 5,000 calories a day'

'The binge drinking continued until my 30s. My daily diet would be a fry up for breakfast, fried chicken for lunch, and then I’d get straight out on the lash.

'Being a true West Country boy, I would drink 15 pints of cider on a night out without even thinking about it. I must have been consuming more than 5,000 calories a day.'

Mr Jones said a turning point came in 2011, a day before a 30th birthday party for his current partner, Georgina Wilkie, 33, a personal assistant working in the NHS.

He said: 'I wanted to buy a decent outfit for the party but could barely find anything in the shop which fitted around me.

'I went into the changing room, saw myself in the mirror and, barely recognising myself, I couldn’t stop crying. I knew I had to make a change.'

Mr Jones began on the Cambridge 
Weight Plan, which offers meal replacement as a route to a balanced diet, promoting weight control.

In just over five months he lost an incredible 11st 4lb.

The 39-year-old now weighs a healthy 11 stone after ditching his binge drinking and abandoning his habitual trips to the pub and takeaway

Mr Jones has now become a wellbeing consultant, weighs 12 stone and has started playing football again

Today he weighs a stable 12 stone, has a 30 inch waist and has begun playing football again for the first time since his youth.

He said: 'People were amazed that I lost so much weight so quickly, and there are still some who expect me to put it back on. But I’m two years slim now and I feel like a completely different person.

'I can still have a cider and enjoy a takeaway from time to time, but the reasons behind why I eat and drink are different to when I was larger. I’m in control now.'

In January 2013, Mr Jones decided to become a wellbeing consultant and has since established the Revolution Health and Wellbeing Centre in Burnham-on-Sea, where he has a growing base of clients keen to emulate his success.

He is also looking to release an album of songs he has written about his transformation, entitled Great Expectations.

He said: 'I keep a picture of me when I was larger in my office, which I use to reassure my clients when they feel challenged.

'I know exactly how they’re feeling, but now I feel as if there’s nothing I can’t do.'
