Manchester City cut the gap on Premier League leaders Chelsea to three points but it came at a huge cost with star striker Sergio Aguero limping off in tears after sustaining a potentially-serious knee injury near the start of the game.

Aguero received sympathetic applause from stunned City fans as he sadly made his way around the edge of the pitch to the dressing-room after receiving nearly five minutes of treatment.

His eyes were clearly watery both because of the pain and also the prospect of missing Wednesday night's vital Champions League clash away to Roma that will help define City's season.

Though City rallied to win the game with a hotly-disputed Yaya Toure penalty midway through the first half, manager Manuel Pellegrini and the club's supporters will be this morning be hugely concerned by the injury to their 19-goal striker, particularly with the club needing a result in Italy to progress to the last 16 in Europe.

They were without captain Vincent Kompany, David Silva and Stevan Jovetic on Saturday while Edin Dzeko had his first 30 minutes action for a month following a calf injury. Yaya Toure is also suspended for another two Champions League matches.

Pellegrini confirmed: 'Sergio has a problem with his ligament in his knee. It is impossible to know now how long he will be out for but we may know on Sunday. But probably he will miss the game with Roma, it is very difficult to recover from a ligament problem in three days.'

Aguero, who had scored a hat-trick on his previous appearance at The Etihad against Bayern Munich, suffered his injury as he was caught by Everton midfielder Muhamed Besic while clambering to his feet at an awkward angle after being clattered from behind by Seamus Coleman. There were just 75 seconds on the clock.

The 26-year-old is not noted for histrionics so as he lay on the pitch in clear agony disconsolately clutching his left knee, you knew it was serious enough for him to have to depart the action.

Mindful that Aguero's natural replacement Edin Dzeko hadn't himself played since November 8 because of a calf injury, Pellegrini instead sent on 18-year-old Jose Pozo for his third appearance as a substitute in City's first-team, saving the Bosnian for the last half-hour.

Given all the injury problems, Pellegrini was delighted with his side's fighting spirit that helped them take advantage of leaders Chelsea's slip-up at Newcastle earlier in the day.

'It is not easy to beat a team like Everton when you have so many important players not there,' he said.

The visitors would counter that the champions also received a big helping hand from referee Andre Marriner.

Everton manager Roberto Martinez thought two City players Eliaquim Mangala and Fernando should both have been sent off for high boots, Mangala catching Samuel Eto'o in the back with a kung-fu style kick and Fernando making contact with Gareth Barry's head. 

He was also fuming at the key penalty decision after 24 minutes when James Milner tumbled as Phil Jagielka ran across which was ruled a deliberate barge by Mr Marriner but a legitimate shoulder-to-shoulder challenge by Martinez.

'It is part of the game, Milner was not even asking for a penalty. To say I am disappointed is an understatement,' said Martinez.

The visitors surrounded Mr Marriner but City's captain-for-the day Toure struck the ball cleanly past Tim Howard even though the Everton 'keeper correctly dived to his right.

From then onwards, it was sheer guts and determination that saw City through.

'It was an important win for a lot of reasons,' said Pellegrini. 'Chelsea lost their game so it was important to recover points. To be near the leaders.

'This is a difficult month where we have to play seven games in the Premier League. You can't win the title in December but it is a key month so you can start the new year close to the leader.'

City nearly added a second when Pozo was denied by a brilliant reflex save from Howard as he looked for his first Premier League goal from Milner's neat set-up.

But there were jitters towards the end as mid-table Everton had a late rally. Their best opening arrived after 82 minutes and Romelu Lukaku couldn't believe that Joe Hart – who is close to signing a new four-and-a-half-year contract at City – stuck out a strong left hand to his shot and tipped the ball away.

Milner was left dazed in injury-time after getting caught across the back of the head by a flailing elbow from the already-booked Barry, whose next caution will make him the first Premier League player to receive a hundred yellow cards. And there was rancour from home fans towards Everton sub Ross Barkley – ironically a City target - for another theatrical fall.

But depleted City somehow held on. For Pellegrini now, the most immediate priority is Europe. But in Premier League terms the Chelsea v Manchester City fixture on January 31, the final weekend of the transfer window as well, is already looking very tasty.
