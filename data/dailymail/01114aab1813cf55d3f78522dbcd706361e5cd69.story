A family have taken their son out of school along with his younger brother to visit as many of their 500 Facebook friends as possible in person.

David, 47, and Debs Hurst, 36, along with their sons Daniel, five, and Darley, three, and Colin the dog, have put their lives on hold to travel around Britain and Europe.

For each person seen by the family, they are taking a face-to-face selfie, donating £2 to Cancer Research UK and challenging the friend to do the same with someone on their own Facebook list.

Big trip: The couple downsized their home in Exeter, Devon, to buy a Swift Escape 696 camper van - worth £41,000 new - and deferred Daniel’s entry to primary school before setting off three weeks ago

They downsized their £280,000 three-bed cottage near Tavistock, Devon, bought a Swift Escape 696 van worth £41,000 and deferred Daniel’s entry to primary school before setting off three weeks ago.

On Friday they arrived in Aberdeen, Scotland, meeting Candice and James Myers - contacts number 99 and 100 in the Face2Facebook project.

Among their friends is Dan Skinner, better known as Angelos Epithemiou from quiz show Shooting Stars. They intend to tour Scotland before setting off around Europe, returning home in January.

Mr Hurst, who is self-employed, said today: ‘Our Face2Facebook project started to form three years ago after we lost a relative unexpectedly to cancer.

‘My uncle developed a sore throat and died three weeks later from oesophageal cancer. A year after this a best friend took his life.

‘These emphasised to us that the most important thing in life is family and friends, so we hope that as well as us seeing many of our friends and family, we’ll also inspire others to do so to celebrate friendship - and everyone raises money for charity as they do. 

'We want people to see not just a friend but a friend they know they are long overdue to see.

'We hope it really takes off and people go to see their long-lost friends while raising money for charity.’

He added: 'The most important things in life are not things at all, but family and friends. Yet we were taken aback when we realised how many of our family and friends we hadn't actually seen for years.

'While Facebook is fantastic for staying in touch, it can veil how infrequently many of us truly see those we love. It was a difficult decision to postpone the date as to when our son started school - however, we believe that travel is the best form of education.

The family will soon be off to Spain on the ferry from Portsmouth to Santander. The family plan to visit Barcelona, Valencia, Malaga and Ibiza, as well as Hamburg in Germany, Amsterdam and Paris

'Daniel and his three-year-old brother, Darley, will be learning the value of family and friendship - that the world is generally a wonderful place with decent people in it - and they'll learn about kindness and thinking of others.

'Travelling will also develop their self-confidence, and teach them about new languages, geography, geology, history, music, sport, religion, cooking and culture.' 

The family have already visited the likes of Devon, Sussex, Surrey, Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, London, North Yorkshire, Northumberland, Fife, Dundee and Perth,

They are off to Lancashire over the next few days, then down to Gloucestershire and Bristol, before going to Buckinghamshire and London.

Then they are off to Spain on the ferry from Portsmouth to Santander. The family plan to visit Barcelona, Valencia, Malaga and Ibiza, as well as Hamburg in Germany, Amsterdam  and Paris.

Mr Hurst said he was grateful for the Camping and Caravaning Club's support for the trip, and added that the family were staying on their campsites in Britain. Click here to read more about their trip.
