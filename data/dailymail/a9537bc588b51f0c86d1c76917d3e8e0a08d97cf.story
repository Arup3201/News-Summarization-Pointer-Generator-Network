Charities warn that deep spending cuts for councils have harmed the potential of voluntary groups to provide public services

David Cameron’s Big Society is dead, leading charities declared today.

The Prime Minister is warned his early enthusiasm for involving voluntary groups in running Britain is ‘going nowhere’.

The Big Society concept was widely ridiculed when floated by Mr Cameron before the 2010 general election, with even supporters of the idea complaining that the PM had failed to explain what it actually meant.

The Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, which represents 2,000 charities, claims reforms designed to hand power from Whitehall to communities and good causes are moving ‘glacially slow’.

Criticism of government reforms comes as Mr Cameron and Deputy PM Nick Clegg today launch a Mid-Term Review of the coalition’s progress and set out new policies for the next two and a half years.

Mr Cameron had boasted that the Big Society was his ‘great passion’ but critics said it was vague and was being used as a cover for cuts to public services.

Councils which provide huge levels of income for charities have seen funding from Westminster slashed.

Charities also warn that people who rely on state are seeing support eroded.

In a letter to the Prime Minister, head of the ACEVO Sir Stephen Bubb claimed major changes to the way services were provided have been abandoned, leaving the Big Society 'effectively dead'.

David Cameron has pushed the Big Society agenda, despite critics saying it was vague and a cover for spending cuts

‘As Prime Minister, you described 
building a Big Society as your 'great passion' and 'central to my vision
for our country',’ Sir Stephen wrote, according to The Times.

‘You spoke eloquently of your desire to reform public services, with a significantly greater role for charities.’

Potential for charities to become involved in providing public services ‘remains largely untapped, with reforms in too many areas glacially slow’, he added.

‘The mood music across Whitehall has been that reform is off the agenda. The reality many charities now face is crippling spending cuts.’

Sir Stephen Bubb, head of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, used a letter to the PM to warn his Big Society vision is 'effectively dead'

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘From day one of the coalition Government, we have worked to help charities and social enterprises do more good.

‘Red tape has been cut, new incentives for giving have been introduced and the world’s first social investment institution, Big Society Capital, has been delivered.’
