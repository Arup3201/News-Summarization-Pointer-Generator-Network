Even at six months pregnant, Fearne Cotton still manages to look bang on trend.

From her cosy yet cool fur coats to her kooky knitted hats, the Very designer and presenter never has a fashion faux pas.

And now, she has passed on her words of wisdom speaking exclusively to FEMAIL about her winter wardrobe staples.

The presenter turned designer always has her style bang on trend and now she shares her secrets with FEMAIL

What are your three winter clothing staples?

Good pair of tights, definitely – couldn’t live without them. A good pair of boots, like I say those studded ones I’ve been wearing to death at the moment. And just a really good, durable winter coat that still looks nice, so something faux fur or a nice tailored, warm coat.

What are your favourite winter party wear trends this year?

Over the years Christmas-wise we’ve done some really fun stuff, and you can be a bit extra glitzy and glam, so I’ve done some that have been full-on sequins, I did one with a big bow on it, like a sequin dress that’s really cute. One year I did this black dress with a big white sequin bow on it, so I think it’s an opportunity to wear stuff that’s slightly camper and more glitzy, so yeah, sequins and glitz.

Fearne's love of sequins was chanelled through her Children in Need dress that added some real sparkle to the stage

Have you got your ‘Christmas party’ look planned?

It’s so difficult, I was looking for something glitzy to wear for Children In Need but it’s very challenging having a body that doesn’t fit normal clothes at the moment. So yeah, I guess it’s just about being inventive, and probably more about a plain dress with a big, bejewelled necklace, something like that is probably going to be my winter staples this year.

Are there any fashion pieces on your Christmas wishlist this year?

It’ll probably unfortunately be slippers because I’ll want to just be hibernating for a little while at Christmas. But yeah I can’t get enough of big, cosy jumpers, so knitwear at the moment, anything like that. And just good winter coats, can’t have too many of those – and also hats, love a winter hat, maybe a little beret or something like that.

Are you a last-minute Christmas gift buyer, or do you plan way in advance?

I’m doing my Christmas gift shopping right now, as we speak, I’m getting it done, I’m not leaving it until the last minute this year, no way. I never usually leave it to the last minute but I usually do it in December. But this year I want it all done in November, so that’s my aim and my goal.

Have you ever/would you ever consider spending Christmas abroad somewhere hot and sunny?

I never have. I’ve gone away for New Year most years but never for Christmas because for me it’s all about family and getting all of us out anywhere would be a nightmare because there’s so many of us. So for me Christmas is more about who I’m with rather than where I’m with, but if someone wants to take all of the Cottons away one year to a tropical island I’m not going to say no!

Cosy knitwear and big cardigans are on Fearne's wish list this Christmas

How will you be spending Christmas and New Year’s Eve this year?

Just spending time with my family because I’ll be huge by then! And I would have just finished working, so it’ll be a time to really start winding down and spending loads of time with my cousins and mum and dad and brother and boyfriend and his kids, so yep, just lots of food and family!

What’s the best/worst Christmas present you’ve ever received?

Best… I’ve had lots of nice ones, I’m very lucky. One year I got KitchenAid, which I use more than anything I own, so that was a pretty good one. The worst… I’m not going to say it was the worst, but the most unusual was my mum once sponsored me a tree in the New Forest. Which is weird considering I will never see that tree, but it’s there and I sponsor it, so that was quite a while back now.

We love your Christmas collection for Very - what’s your favourite piece/piece that you’ve worn the most that you have designed?

I always go on things that I’ve worn the most, and the two things that I’ve definitely worn the most are the black boots with all the studs up the back, I’ve worn to the point of them falling apart.

And there was another pair of black boots, I think it was my second collection ages ago, that are just plain black flat boots, and I wore them so much that at Reading this year they fell apart and I had to leave them there, and I was like ‘But I can’t get these again because they don’t sell them anymore! Oh my god!’ and I had to just put them in the bin, I was so upset about it.

So those two pairs of boots I wore loads, and also in the Autumn/Winter stuff that’s on sale now, there’s a cream faux fur coat that I wear all the time because it’s so cosy and looks really glam and 50s, so I’ve worn that loads and loads.

Last Christmas saw Fearne's very collection go retro with a Debbie Harris inspired look

And it’s always those pieces that I know – because a lot of my Very stuff, because obviously there’s so much of it coming in each season, and I wear as much of it as I can, I’ll put a lot of it in storage so I can give it to my kids one day or whatever.

And it all goes flat-pack in boxes, but then there’s some pieces that never go in, like this cream coat definitely won’t, the boots won’t, a couple of the duffel coats from before I always keep out because I know that I’ll wear them each year, so it’s nice to have stuff that isn’t disposable, that will come back each Winter or Spring/Summer.

Have you got into using blogs for inspiration?

I do a bit, I tend to more so look at fashion shows online afterwards, because I don’t really go to many because I find them utterly bizarre and terrifying (apart from my own one, of course). So yeah, I tend to look at a few blogs off of either shopping websites, obviously Very have got one and there’s other online stores that have them as well, and magazines like Glamour have a whole fashion blog.

Despite being heavily pregnant, Fearne still looks super stylish

I look at magazine websites quite a lot but I try and limit my internet use for when I’m just at Radio 1 because I think the internet’s quite evil, so I don’t usually go on it when I’m at home. So a lot of mine is more like magazine research, and books and stuff, and then the odd look at – if there’s been a massive fashion show that I’ve loved the look of – then I’ll have a look through the pictures of it when it’s been online.

Do you have any red carpet fashion rules?

You have to walk out the door feeling comfortable and confident, because if you walk out the door and think ‘Oh my god, I feel really exposed in this’ or uncomfortable or it’s too tight, you’re going to feel like crap all night, so just walk out the door feeling good.
