The daughter of former reality show star Will Hayden, who was arrested last month on child molestation charges, is now claiming that she too was sexually abused as a child by her father.

Stephanie Hayden, who also starred in the recently cancelled Discovery reality show ‘Sons Of Guns’, is reportedly set to provide information to law enforcement in the coming days to aid in her father’s prosecution.

Her decision sparks a dramatic turnaround as she had originally pledged to stand by her father despite his arrest on August 9 for the alleged sexual abuse of her 12-year-old sister.

'There was never any impropriety in our home,' she said at the time. 'He was and is a good father.'

Stephanie is now recanting her original statement and is set to meet with investigators in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to provide specific details of the sexual abuse she allegedly suffered, reports TMZ.

‘After 45 shows and 20 years, this is the first I've heard of it,’ an attorney for her father told TMZ. 

‘Her complaints arose only after her income from the show and [gun] shop stopped. She's still Will's daughter, and he loves her.’

Hayden, 49, was initially arrested on August 9 on charges of molestation of a child and a crime against nature.

The gun store owner posted $150,000 bond the same day and was released. He told TMZ at the time that his ex-girlfriend, who is the mother of one of his daughters, went to authorities a week ago and accused him of molesting the girl.

He said that she did it as revenge for him ending their relationship.Hayden had since married and was bringing up the girl with his new wife. 

Sons of Guns first aired on the Discovery Channel in 2011 and followed Hayden's life at the helm of a gun store, Red Jacket Firearms

The youngster returned to his home after he was interviewed by Child Protective Services.

Hayden was then re-arrested on August 26 and charged with aggravated rape charges involving a child and bail was at $250,000

According to allegations in an affidavit filed by sheriff's deputies, Hayden began having sex with the child, then 11 years old, in 2013. The latest rape, the report said, happened in July.

A guardian of the victim had contacted deputies on August 16. The victim confided to the guardian after Hayden's August 9 arrest, according to the report.

Deputies said they met with the child and guardian and took a statement.

According to the affidavit, the child told deputies Hayden took her virginity when she was 11 years old and that sex acts happened almost daily thereafter.

In the wake of Hayden’s second arrest, Stephanie’s husband Kristafor Ford posted a poem on Facebook in which he accused his wife’s father of molesting her as a child

The report says Hayden coerced the victim into silence with threats of physical abuse.

'Don't tell them nothing because I'm all you've got,' the affidavit says the 49-year-old Hayden told the victim.

After her father's initial arrest, Stephanie had defended him on Facebook.

'This was a false allegation and unfortunately that's all it takes,' she wrote. 'My father is a good man, and ALL of his children love him very much and are truly sickened that a person would try to do this to our family. Its not right [sic]. You see the love we have for our family...

'The one thing that really hurts us is that my sister is heartbroken that anyone could think this of her father. Its a nightmare...please stand with us.'

But then in the wake of Hayden’s second arrest, Stephanie’s husband Kristafor Ford posted a poem on Facebook in which he accused his wife’s father of molesting her as a child.

Stephanie posted to a family member on Facebook that she had given her husband permission to post his poem about being abused - both posts were taken down soon after.

'You fooled with my wife when she was young. Sucking and groping, do you remember what was done? Well she does, and she told me how you made her feel,' he wrote. 

Stephanie then posted that she had given her husband permission to post it. Both posts were  taken down soon after.

Sons of Guns first aired on the Discovery Channel in 2011 and followed Hayden's life at the helm of a gun store, Red Jacket Firearms.

Episodes often showed him and Stephanie helping customers find weapons, including rifles. Other scenes showed the process of making the guns, images from firing ranges, and ammunition tips.

After the arrest, The Discovery Channel cancelled the show, citing ‘the serious and horrific nature of the charges’ against Hayden. Red Jacket Firearms has also legally cut ties with him.
