Israeli troops today demolished the homes of two Palestinians it suspects of the abduction and killing of three teenagers in the occupied West Bank in June, the army said.

Troops set charges to destroy the homes of Hussam Kawasme and Amar Abu Aysha in the southern West Bank before dawn and sealed off the home of a third suspect, Marwan Kawasme.

Israel accuses Hamas Islamist militants of the abduction and killing of Jewish seminary students Gil-Ad Shaer, Naftali Fraenkel and Eyal Yifrah, who went missing on June 12 and were discovered dead a couple of weeks later in the West Bank.

Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied those accusations.

Hussam
 Kawasme, a 40-year-old resident of Hebron, was arrested on July 11 but 
the other two suspects remain at large, the army said.

The
 killings set off a cycle of violence that led to a month-long offensive
 between Israel and militants in Hamas-dominated Gaza.

Israel
 carried out air strikes and a ground offensive in the enclave to 
counter militant rocket fire and to blow up a network of tunnels dug 
under the border to infiltrate the Jewish state.

The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza says 1,980 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed in the conflict.

On the Israeli side, 64 soldiers and three civilians have been killed.

A ceasefire that brought fighting to a halt is due to expire later today and Egyptian-mediated talks to end the conflict are not certain to succeed, according to Palestinian delegates participating in the talks in Cairo.

Tensions between Jewish and Arab citizens in Israeli were highlighted yesterday when police blocked more than 200 far-right Israeli protesters from rushing guests at a wedding of a Jewish woman and Muslim man as they shouted 'death to the Arabs'.

Several dozen police, including members of the force's most elite units, formed human chains to keep the protesters from the wedding hall's gates and chased after many who defied them.Four protesters were arrested, and there were no injuries.

A lawyer for the couple, Maral Malka, 
23, and Mahmoud Mansour, 26, both from the Jaffa section of Tel Aviv, 
had unsuccessfully sought a court order to bar the protest.

He obtained backing for police to keep protesters 200 yards from the wedding hall in the Tel Aviv suburb of Rishon Lezion.

The protest highlighted a rise in tensions between Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel in the past two months amid a month-long Gaza war, the kidnap and slaying of three Israeli teens in June followed by a revenge choking and torching to death of a Palestinian teen in the Jerusalem area.

Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday any deal on Gaza's future had
 to meet Israel's security needs, warning Hamas it faced 'harsh strikes'
 if it resumed firing into the Jewish state.

With
 a five-day ceasefire due to expire late on Monday, negotiators returned
 after consultations to Cairo to seek an end to five weeks of 
hostilities that have killed more than 2,000 people.

The United Nations said 425,000 people in the Gaza Strip have been displaced by the war.
