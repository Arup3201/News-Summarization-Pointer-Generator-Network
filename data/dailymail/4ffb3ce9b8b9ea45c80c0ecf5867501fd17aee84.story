Shoppers are being misled by supermarket price-match schemes that do not bring the lower  grocery bills they expect.

Rules in the small print and exclusions mean the stores are not comparing like with like, warn campaigners.

Major players like Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Asda insist their schemes save customers money and time as they do not need to shop around.

But Which? said its research found that each store tended to skew its comparisons to give the impression that it was the cheapest place to shop.

In theory, the schemes compare the total price of items in a shopping basket against the same items sold by two or more competitors.

If a rival is cheaper, the customer should get a voucher at the till or online for the difference.

Researchers looking at 20 receipts from Sainsbury’s found the store claimed to be the cheapest on ten and joint-cheapest on two others.

But its Brand Match scheme failed to take the cost of own label products into account, which means the final bill could be lower at a rival.

Small print means that Sainsbury’s can also refuse to match the lowest price of a branded product at a rival on some occasions.

At the same time, the chain only matches its prices against Asda and Tesco – but not Morrisons, which may be cheaper.

Researchers examining 20 Tesco till receipts said it claimed to be cheapest for ten shopping baskets.

Britain’s biggest supermarket – like Asda – does include own brand products in its Price Promise but only those it considers are of comparable quality.

Asda goes further with a Price Guarantee, which gives out vouchers if the store’s basket is not at least 10 per cent cheaper.

Which? found Asda claimed to be cheaper in 17 out of 19 checked receipts. Supermarkets often have slightly different pack sizes on popular foods, like cheese, which make comparisons difficult, leaving them further leeway to deny a voucher.

The cost of living squeeze has led many shoppers to cut the amount they buy and turn to budget brands.

Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd said: ‘Price-matching should be taken with a pinch of salt.’

This concern is confirmed in a ruling today from the Advertising Standards Authority banning a ‘misleading’ Sainsbury’s advert.

It implied the chain would match the lowest price on brands sold by rivals but this was not always true. Sainsbury’s insisted consumers understand how Brand Match works and it ‘does the hard work by giving them a coupon at the till’.

Tesco said vouchers ‘make it up to customers in a way they notice’ if their bill would have been lower elsewhere. Asda said its scheme means it beats rivals on price rather than just matching them.
