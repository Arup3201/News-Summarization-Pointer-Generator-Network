George Osborne will tonight launch a pre-election attack on the Lib Dems, accusing his coalition partners of ‘political opportunism’ and threatening the recovery by blocking a referendum on Europe.

The Tory Chancellor will use a speech to business leaders to warn Nick Clegg’s position of remaining in the European Union under any circumstances is taking a ‘risk with our economy’.

Mr Osborne will also attack Labour's 'threat' to school standards and take a swipe at the Lib Dems for making ‘unaffordable and undeliverable’ promises to scrap tuition fees before the last election.

George Osborne has said Ukip is a threat to the economy, but today claimed the Lib Dems' attitude to Europe was also damaging prosperity

Hours before polling stations open for local and European Parliament elections tomorrow, Mr Osborne will make a series of coded attacks on the party he has shared power with for the last four years.

In a speech to the CBI dinner in London, the Chancellor will warn of several long term risks to national prosperity.

He will tell pro-European business leaders that while they say there are risks to leaving the EU now, there are also dangers with agreeing to remain a member under any circumstances

‘It is true that those who want Britain to leave the EU now, instead of working to reform it, are taking a risk with our economy.’

In a direct attack on the Lib Dem position, he will added: ‘Those who advocate membership of this union, whatever the direction it heads in and regardless of the costs it imposes on our businesses, are also taking a risk with our economy.

Ed Miliband, visiting a newly-built council housing complex in Lincoln today, is a threat to teaching standards, claimed the Chancellor

‘On its current course, the EU is pricing our continent out of the global economy.’

EU regulations are estimated to cost the UK alone up to £27 billion a year, and the Tories have a plant to reverse the ‘direction of centralising power and loading ever higher costs on the European economy’, Mr Osborne will say.

‘For that direction is destroying jobs, killing innovation, and with it, calling into question the legitimacy of the Union itself.

‘And for those who say that a referendum creates uncertainty, I say: a referendum is the only way to resolve the uncertainty that already hangs over Britain’s relationship with Europe.’

The Lib Dems have refused to match the Tory pledge to renegitaite Britain’s EU membvership before holding an in-out referendum by 2017.

Mr Osborne will also go on the attack over tuition fees, striking at the heart of the issue which has caused Mr Clegg more pain than any other.

After promising to abolish tuition fees before the 2010 election, the Lib Dems then backed trebling them to £9,000 because both neither the Tories or Labour would agree with their policy.

Mr Osborne will claim the quality of education is a risk to the economy, and argue Tory reforms to free schools, exams and a greater emphaisis on maths, science and engineering are under threat.

‘For the first time in two decades there is now a determined effort underway in Britain to reverse the decline of educational standards – and give children the quality of schooling this modern age demands.

‘All this is a massive change for the better in the education system of our country – a change whose benefits will be felt in 10, 20, 30 years time as today’s children find themselves better equipped to get good careers; and tomorrow’s businesses find themselves better able to recruit a world-class workforce.

‘But these education reforms, pursued until now by parties of the right and left, are under threat – from vested interests, from the unreconstructed teaching unions, and from the political opportunism of promising students the unaffordable and undeliverable.’

Reneging on the tuition fees pledge in autumn 2010 proved to be the most damaging decision Mr Clegg has made in coalition.

His poll ratings slumped and have never recovered. The party face losing hundreds of councillors and several MEPs in tomorrow’s elections.

A senior Lib Dem source dismissed the attack as an attempt to divert attentions from Tory divisions: 'The Conservatives are hopelessly split on Europe and openly flirting with exit, which would destroy British jobs. Liberal Democrats are the only party standing up for British jobs and our place in Europe.

Nick Clegg, today out delivering leaflets in Stockport, has claimed leaving the EU would cost millions of jobs

'We want to change the EU for the better, to cut waste and boost trade, but we know the best way to do that is to be there getting stuck in, not complaining from the sidelines,' the source added

 Mr Osborne will also attack the anti-business alliance of Labour and the ‘populist Right’ – a reference to Ukip.

He is expected to accuse the pair of wanting to ‘pull up the drawbridge and shut Britain off from the world’.

The Chancellor will say: ‘They want to constrain foreign investment in our economy, and deprive us of the British jobs that it has created in industries from car manufacturing to energy,’ he will tell the Confederation of British Industry.

‘They want to set prices, regulate incomes, impose rent controls, wage war on big business, demonise wealth creation, renationalise industries – and pretend that they can re-establish control over all aspects of the economy.

‘Whether from the Left or the populist Right, we now see a deeply pessimistic, depressing, anti-business agenda.’

Mr Osborne’s remarks are designed as a trenchant attack of the economic policies of Labour’s Ed Miliband and Ed Balls, who have unsettled business leaders with a series of 1970s-style policy proposals.

But it is also a provocative riposte to those in his own party and Ukip who have expressed concern about foreign take-overs – most recently the stalled Pfizer bid for British-based drugs firm AstraZeneca.
