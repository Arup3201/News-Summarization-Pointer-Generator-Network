Planning a weekend break? If so, the chances are you have already wildly underestimated how much your trip will cost.

In fact, a new survey has revealed that British tourists overspend on European city breaks by more than double what they had initially planned.

According to travel search site Skyscanner, Britons typically budget 65 per cent less than the total spend they are likely to need for a weekend break in Europe.

But in some cases such as travelling to Paris or Amsterdam, they blow their budgets by more than double what they had planned.

The study looked at the total cost for a two night break for two people, staying in a four-star hotel in ten of Europe's top holiday cities.

The survey found that total costs, including flights, ranged from £500 for a trip to Prague to over £900 for a weekend in Paris.

The average cost of a city break was found to be around £700 per couple.

Alarmingly Brits perceived the cost of a trip to Prague to be around £380, and the price of a trip to Paris £460.

Brits are also confused as to which cities offer the best value for money, believing Amsterdam to be the cheapest, when in fact the study found it was the third most expensive option. 

The survey revealed that the total cost was around £400 more than Brits expected.

The study also found that Milan and Rome were perceived to be the most expensive, when in reality they are the third and fourth cheapest cities in the study.

The new guide from Skyscanner has now calculated the total cost for two people staying in each of the top ten cities, Amsterdam, Prague, Istanbul, London, Munich, Barcelona, Vienna, Paris, Milan, and Rome.

It also breaks down the cost for each element of the trip including flights, accommodation in a four-star city centre hotel with breakfast, entrance to a top tourist attraction, sightseeing bus tour, dinner and beer.

The breakdown costs for each city highlights that a cheap flight does not necessarily equal a cheap break.

In some cases, such as Istanbul, taking a slightly more expensive flight is still worth it as the other costs when you get there are so much cheaper.

While Prague offers the cheapest beer, with an average cost of £1.14 a bottle, Paris was the most expensive, costing on average £6.03 a bottle.

Skyscanner's Mary Porter said: 'As our guide shows, a cheap flight does not necessarily guarantee a great value city break – two return flights can be under 30 percent of the total cost, as is the case with Paris.

'It's therefore important to consider all your city break costs and we hope that this guide provides clarity for travellers so that planning and budgeting for a weekend is as easy as possible.'
