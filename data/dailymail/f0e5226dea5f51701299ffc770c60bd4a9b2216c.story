A judge has sided with Oprah Winfrey's estranged stepmother in a bitter divorce battle, ruling her 79-year-old father's 'adultery and inappropriate marital conduct' were behind the couple's split.

The decision came just days after Barbara Winfrey, 66, reportedly dragged her billionaire daughter-in-law into the messy 18-month-long fight, alleging Oprah was trying to swindle her out of money.

Vernon Winfrey's initial June 2012 petition for divorce was rejected in a November 1 ruling and Barbara's separate bid to end their 12-year union was granted, with Oprah's dad ordered to pay his ex-wife nearly $70,000 in attorney fees.

Barbara claimed Vernon cheated on her
for years with prostitutes including one named 'One Tooth' and 
threatened to shoot her. She also claimed a woman tried to blackmail him over a sordid sex tape.

'Barbara J. Winfrey is entitled to a divorce on the grounds of adultery and inappropriate marital conduct,' Tennessee Supreme Court judge Donald P. Harris wrote in his ruling, according to RadarOnline.

The National Enquirer reported that court papers filed on October 11 by Barbara Winfrey alleged 'several pieces of marital property' had been placed in a trust to avoid sharing them with her.

The documents also allege Oprah slashed her father's stipend in a bid to limit any income payments he may have to pay his ex-wife and also set up a trust that deliberately excludes her.

Harris' November 1 ruling stated that the TV talk show star purchased a property her father and his wife owned after he had gifted it to another man, Thomas Walker, who then defaulted on the mortgage.

'The court finds (Vernon Winfrey) allowed (the marital property) to go into foreclosure knowing that it would be purchased by his daughter, Oprah, for his and Thomas Walker's benefit and to defeat any interest of Barbara Winfrey,' the ruling stated.

As such, Harris ruled that Barbara should be 'held harmless from the payment of this indebtedness' and penalized Vernon, ordering that he be held liable for one of the pair's loan accounts.

A spokesman for Oprah told Radar that she stepped in because she didn't want her father's 'life work to be dissolved.'

'The property was in foreclosure and when it went up for auction, Ms. Winfrey bid and got it because she didn't want her father's life work to be dissolved,' the rep said.

Meanwhile, new revelations of the couple's split have emerged, with Barbara accusing Vernon in the same October 11 court papers of using his barbershop for 'sexual escapades' during their marriage that many in their community knew about, including the students Barbara taught at the local school.

'One Tooth' was the most humiliating visitor she alleged, as well as a woman who tried to blackmail Vernon, claiming she would hand over a 2008 sex tape to the local Channel 2 News if he didn't pay up.

In May, Vernon reportedly admitted he'd been filmed in the act and that the offending tape had been offered to the ABC News affiliate for broadcast but he said 'I think the fellow refused to do so.'

He added he was never going to pay up, and would have accepted the consequences of the tape going to air.

'Oprah is furious at Barbara for trying to drag both her and her father through the mud,' a family member reportedly told the Enquirer.

'Oprah loves her father but she's stunned at Barbara's sensational claims. The allegations about the prostitute and the gun are almost too much to take. The idea that her father would conduct himself this way is very disturbing to Oprah.'

Barbara's court documents also describe how Vernon allegedly threatened to shoot her when he was 'drunk and angry' one night and 'chased (her) around the island in their kitchen with a gun in his pocket, saying he would shoot her.'

Vernon reportedly admitted during the deposition that the couple had a disagreement and that he was in possession of a gun but said he never attempted to put his hand on his weapon.
