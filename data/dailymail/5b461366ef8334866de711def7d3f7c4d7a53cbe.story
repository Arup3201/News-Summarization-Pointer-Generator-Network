Russia has come under fire for giving an 18+ rating to a child's computer game - because characters can be gay.

The Sims 4 has been marked as 'harmful' to Russian youth by a Kremlin-appointed body because the country's strict anti-gay laws forbid children being exposed to same-sex relationships.

British watchdogs are expected to rate the game as suitable for children as young as 12.

Russia's anti-gay laws have long been the subject of protests, which gained worldwide coverage in the run up to the Olympics. Here, demonstrators pictured in London last summer hold placards depicting Putin in drag

But Russian officials have slapped it with their harshest possible rating, forbidding anyone under the age of 18 from playing the PC game.

The previous version of the game, The Sims 3, also features same-sex relationships, and that was rated as suitable for ages six and up.

Electronic Arts, the team behind The Sims, have lashed out at Russia's strict censoring policy and have vowed not to change the game ahead of its worldwide launch later this year.

Spokesman Deborah Coster said: 'We have no plans to alter The Sims 4.

'One of the key tenets of The Sims is that it is up to the player to decide how to play the game.

'We provide the simulation sandbox and player choice and creativity does the rest.'

A spokesman for the computer game, which British children aged 12 can play, said they will not make changes

The shock announcement of the strict age rating came on Twitter from The Sims In Russia.

The equivalent age rating for British computer games would be 18, reserved for ultra-violent games such as Grand Theft Auto or Call of Duty.

The Sims 4 fell foul of Russia's controversial 436-FZ law, which was passed in 2010 under the name 'On Protecting Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development.'

The Sims 3, which has a 12-plus rating in Russia, was released in 2009, before that law came into force.

Russian factory worker Aleksandr Yevseyev, 27, has played several of the games in the series.

Aleksandr, from Samara, said: 'Millions of Russians play The Sims. It is a very good game.

The controversy has sparked outrage, as some Russian players advocate 'a different version' for gay people

'But I don't understand why this new game has to have so many problems.

'If some people want to be gay, let them buy a different version that allows them to be gay.

'I am not gay so I do not want to play as a gay Sim, but I have gay friends who might want to marry their gay Sim lover. We should have separate games.

'That could solve the problem. We are not European. We are Russian and our beliefs and way of thinking should not be judged according to Western ideas.'

The new game is thought to be similar to its predecessor, where players control their Sims - virtual representations of themselves - in all manner of 'real life' situations like going to work or falling in love.

Like all other games in the series, while romance and dating are possible, all sex-scenes are heavily pixelated and unclear.
