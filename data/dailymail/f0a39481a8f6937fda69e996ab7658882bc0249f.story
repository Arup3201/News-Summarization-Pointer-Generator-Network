For the six million Britons who  are carers to an adult – and the 6,000 people who take on this huge responsibility every day – finding the right support can be daunting.

The British Medical Association has released a Carer’s Manual to help. In the second of three extracts, we look at how to make the necessary changes to the home .  .  .

Providing a helping hand: Six million Britons are carers to an adult, often a family member who suffers from a long-term health problem

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

When you think about how to adapt a home to suit a person’s particular needs, it is important to consider costs, aesthetics, the impact of the changes on the home, and how they may affect other household members. Hasty decisions can be costly, so it can pay to seek professional advice.

The changes made will depend on the circumstances of the person you are caring for. Someone who is convalescing for a short period after illness won’t need expensive changes – look for low-cost, practical solutions.

If specialist equipment is needed for a short period, you might be able to borrow it. For example, the British Red Cross lends medical equipment such as wheelchairs (redcross.co.uk,  0844 871 1111).

SEEK ADVICE

Before making any adaptations, it is  a good idea to seek advice from an occupational therapist – health professionals who specialise in enabling people with limited mobility, illness or other special needs to maintain their independence in the home.

They also give advice on equipment and can make arrangements for home adaptations to be carried out. They can be accessed through your doctor or social services.

Before you meet the therapist, it’s worth listing all the areas where you feel that help is needed. For example, does a person have difficulty accessing the bathroom because it involves climbing stairs?

Helping hand: As thousands daily take on the job as a carer for an ill family member or relative, a manual by the British Medical Association has been released to help them get of the ground

TRY BEFORE YOU BUY

There is a vast array of equipment and gadgets designed to help people with particular needs carry out everyday tasks. Items are advertised in newspapers, magazines and on TV, and even sold in supermarkets. Of course, some modifications are expensive, so remember:

PAYING FOR ADAPTATIONS

Whether or not you receive financial support for modifications is dependent on whether a home is privately owned or rented, council-owned or rented through a housing association. Disability Rights UK (disablityrightsuk.org, 08450 264748) and Disabled Living Foundation  (dlf.org.uk, 08451 309177) may be able to provide further information.

If you are eligible, some assessments can be fast-tracked, especially if an individual’s needs are not complex. For instance, all that may be required is the fitting of a rail for them to hold on to.
