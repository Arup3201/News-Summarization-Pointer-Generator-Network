Tributes have been paid to a schoolgirl who died suddenly on a family holiday after contracting a serious blood infection.

Sarah Port, 13, is believed to have fallen ill during the trip and died a short time later from streptococcal septicaemia.

Sarah, who was a year eight pupil at Bradley Stoke Community School in Bristol, has been described as ‘cheerful’ and ‘lovely’ girl.

Friends are said to be planning to set up a memorial in her name ahead of her funeral which will be later this week.

A statement released by the school said: ‘We are deeply saddened and shocked to have to announce the sudden death of Sarah Port who was in tutor group 8G.

‘She died whilst on holiday with her family from streptococcal septicaemia.

‘The thoughts and prayers of the whole school community are with her family and friends at this time of tragic loss and grief.

‘Sarah was a lovely, kind, well-liked and cheerful student. She was lively and fully engaged in the academic and community aspects of school life.

‘Sarah had a special love of the sporting and active opportunities offered by school and was keen to volunteer and get involved.

‘She represented school at netball and had recently extended her love of the water by going on a school trip to Spain in July, where she enjoyed sailing, snorkelling and other water sports.

‘Sarah will be missed enormously by her friends, fellow students and all the staff at school.

‘A memorial and an opportunity to pay tribute to Sarah will be planned, alongside her family and friends, on our return to school in September. In the meantime please think of her family and close friends as the funeral is planned for later this week.

‘There will only be family flowers and so the school community will make a donation in Sarah's memory once the details of this are known.’
