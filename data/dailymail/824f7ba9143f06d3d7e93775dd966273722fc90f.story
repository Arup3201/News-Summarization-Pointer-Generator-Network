Fashion icons such as Cara Delvigne may have created a trend for prominent eyebrows this year, but it seems nobody told North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un.

While giving his annual New Year speech in Pyongyang yesterday, the dictator's brows appeared significantly smaller than when he gave the same address in 2013.

Images captured from both events show the brows have become further apart and significantly shorter in what appears to be a case of severe over-plucking.

It is not yet clear whether Kim will force the rest of the country to copy his over-plucked look, as was the case after he ordered every man in the secretive nation to get the same haircut as him.

The disappearing brows were spotted by eagle-eyed viewers as Kim gave his speech on New Year's Day , announcing possible diplomatic talks between North and South Korea.

In a televised address from the country's capital, Kim spoke of the possibility of 'high-level' negotiations, 'if the atmosphere and conditions are met.'

However he went on to blame the South and America for tension on the peninsula, while making vague promises to improve the country's economy by pursuing science and technology.

The 30-minute speech was the third Kim has delivered since he came to power, but the first after the end of the traditional three-year mourning of the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in late 2011.

The sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has married the son of one of the country's most powerful officials, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said today.

Kim Yo Jong, who is 27 or 28, was said by state media late last year to have assumed a senior position in the ruling Workers' Party. 

She is the only other member of the ruling Kim family known to have an official job within the government, other than Kim Jong Un.

A Chinese source said: 'As far as I know, Kim Yo Jong, deputy director of the Workers' Party, got married to a son of the party secretary Choe Ryong Hae.'

According to the source, the lucky man is Choe Song, second son of Choe senior.

The elder Choe is a high-ranking member of the Workers' Party and widely seen as a close confidant of supreme ruler Kim.

Kim Yo Jong was seen wearing what appears to be a wedding ring in a photo released by the reclusive North's official KCNA news agency today. 

Analysts believe that, with his father removed from the nation's consciousness, the younger Kim will begin to pursue policies more in keeping with his own set of views.

It has been a bad year for Kim, who has been plagued by health problems, and for North Korea as a whole, which has become even more isolated from the world in the wake of the Sony hacks.

Kim disappeared from public for three weeks in September, missing several key state events, after being pictured limping during one televised appearance.

Observers suggested that he may have been deposed by high ranking military generals, but military spokesmen insisted he was only  'suffering from discomfort' due to a medical condition. 

That condition was later theorised to be gout brought on by eating vast quantities of cheese, especially imported Emmental, which is said to be his favourite.

Relations between North Korea and America have ended the year at a low point after Sony Pictures was hacked, a crime blamed on the communist nation.

The release of sensitive employee information and embarrassing email exchanges by high-level executives was seen to be in retaliation for film The Interview, which depicts the assassination of Kim.

While North Korea has denied responsibility, it praised the hacking as a 'righteous act'.

Several days later the country's entire internet was brought offline for a day in a suspected retaliatory move by American authorities, although again nobody has accepted responsibility.

Kim seems to have started 2015 in a positive mood, however, and was pictured visiting an orphanage in Pyongyang today, where he was pictured smiling and playing with the children.
