An outstanding soldier who had to leave the Army after an operation for his loud snoring had catastrophic medical consequences has been awarded £1.5million damages at the High Court.

Richard Downing was a warrant officer in the Army Air Corps with very good prospects of being commissioned when he had the procedure in November 2006, said the judge Sir David Eady.

It made no difference to his snoring but was followed by an infection which led to reactive arthritis and a disabling pain disorder. Mr Downing, now 43, was discharged on medical grounds in August 2010 and is unlikely to work again.

Compensation: Richard Downing had to leave the Army after an operation for his loud snoring had catastrophic medical consequences has been awarded £1.5million damages at the High Court

For long periods, said the judge, the father of two, who had served in Bosnia, was effectively a ‘prisoner’ in his home. He had been unable to participate in everyday family activities, and has a severely restricted social life.

Mr Downing, from Suffolk, brought an action against Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which agreed to compensate him on the basis of 63 per cent liability, without any admissions being made.

The judge said Mr Downing, who is partially wheelchair dependent, was very keen to get better, so far as possible. 

His sense of injustice stemmed from the fact that he was advised to have a ‘pointless’ operation – which led to his suffering constant pain, the loss of an enjoyable and rewarding career and the fundamental upheaval of his happy family life.

Mr Downing told the High Court in London how he felt a ‘failure’ on days when he had to resort to using his wheelchair to get around

‘Money is never going to compensate adequately for that,’ said the judge.’ Nothing is going to remove that sense of injustice.’

Judge Sir David Eady said that if Mr Downing had not become disabled, it was likely he would have retired at 50 with the rank of captain

The judge said it was unlikely that there would be any significant long-term improvement, still less a cure, so far as Mr Downing’s mobility, pain and tendency towards depression was concerned, and there was no prospect of him resuming any paid employment in the foreseeable future.

‘The contrast with his previous personality, physical capacity and positive lifestyle could hardly be greater,’ the judge said.

He added that, thanks mainly to the strength of character of Mr Downing’s wife, ‘the family structure remains largely intact’.

The judge said that if Mr Downing had not become disabled, it was likely he would have retired at 50 with the rank of captain and then obtained a responsible post in the private sector where he would have stayed until he was 68.

The compensation assessed by the judge includes a sum of £93,000 for pain, suffering and loss of enjoyment of life, £435,000 for future accommodation and £343,650 for future care.

Mr Downing told the court in London how he felt a ‘failure’ on days when he had to resort to using his wheelchair to get around the house and ‘detested the contraption’.

His former commanding officer said Mr Downing was ‘exceptionally capable’ and ‘stood out’ among his peers.
