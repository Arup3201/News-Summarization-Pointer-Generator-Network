Pele is due to learn more about the state of his kidney on Thursday as his overall health continues to show signs of improvement.

The Brazilian three-time World Cup winner remains in 'semi-intensive care' at the Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo.

Pele, 74, was admitted on November 24 after being diagnosed with a urinary tract infection that stemmed from a November 13 operation to remove kidney stones. He has only one kidney, having had one removed towards the end of his playing career.

A statement from the hospital on Wednesday was signed by doctors Fabio Nasri and Marcelo Costa Batista, and the hospital's medical director Dr Oscar Pavao.

It read: 'Patient Edson Arantes do Nascimento (Pele) continues with his clinical improvement and is in semi-intensive care. Clinical tests and laboratory results in the morning today were adequate and the patient does not need renal support.

'A new evaluation of the kidney is scheduled for tomorrow morning. He continues without fever, is walking in his room and spending a large part of the day sitting in a chair. He is eating well, without haemodynamic or respiratory changes.'
