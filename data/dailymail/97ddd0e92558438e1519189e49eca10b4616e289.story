A Sydney mother-of-two has criticised a new design of Huggies nappy claiming it seeps fluid.

Up until three weeks ago Janette Ishiuyama, 41, had entrusted her regular Huggies brand to keep Xavier, three, and Maya, one, well protected. However a recent design change has forced her to switch to Baby Love because of repeated and lengthy clean up jobs.

Now other mothers are backing up the claims of leaking and seepage and questioned whether they will ever buy Huggies again.

Janette Ishiyama had suddenly noticed her tried and true Huggies brand was failing to keep her two children, Maya (left) and Xavier, right, dry

Ms Ishiuyama attributes the problems to the new 'thinner look and feel' of the toddler protective wear.

Before realising the nappy was at fault, she tried changing her childrens' feeding requirements and taking other fruitless measures to stop the seepage.

But when she took her complaint to the company itself and wrote about her experience on a Sydney mother's Facebook group - the real reason for the leaks became more apparent.

'There were about 20 odd days or so where they were leaking all the time, I was having to wash sheets daily and and lay down mattress protectors.'

She complained to Huggies directly about their new selling point for the Junior and Walker varieties which claim to be more 'soft and secure' than the original, offering a 'new layer designed to absorb wetness and spring back dry.'

Huggies Walker and Junior varieties have recently undergone a design change

But the altered version, which Mrs Ishiuyama said is 'looser', appears to be causing more problems than solutions across Sydney with her complaint posted to Facebook receiving 41 comments from mums also dealing with the same dilemma of seepage.

Mrs Ishiuyama said it became evident from reading a label on the packaging that it must have been the new design which was causing the problem.

'When I posted to the mother's Facebook group and found similar problems that's when I noticed they (Huggies) had changed the design.'

'I began to feel it (the nappy) when it was on and noticed that it was really loose so I tried a different size but that didn't work.'

She phoned the Huggies hotline and the operator told her that they had various complaints of a similar nature of seepage regarding the Junior and Walker varieties.

A company spokesperson told her to send back two nappies for testing in the hope of finding a resolution to the problem - and the issue is still being investigated.

In the meantime, Mrs Ishiuyama has switched to Baby Love - a brand she could not speak more highly of.

'Other mums themselves have also switched over and posted bout how good they are.'
