She has clearly not left her days as a ballerina behind her.

And as she limbers up, 88-year-old Dame Gillian Lynne displays the same level of agility she had when she was in her 20s.

And despite having two metal hips and a foot that is held together by nails, the former West End star is releasing a workout DVD of the exercises, so that other ‘oldies’, as she likes to refer to herself, can keep fit.

Dame Gillian said the market is geared towards the young but that women of any age can complete her routine

Today, Dame Gillian launches Longevity Through Exercise, which guides viewers through a series of exercises and she is believed to be the oldest person to do so.

Inspired by her lengthy career as a dancer, choreographer and director, including on the hit musical Cats, Dame Gillian has created the exercises to help older women improve their suppleness and wellbeing.

And she made it with her husband Peter Land, 60, because she realised there was nothing on the market for older women.

She said: ‘I hate these video tapes for fitness because they’re always with girls with this hanging out and that hanging out and they’re shouting “one, two, three four” and it’s just, that’s not a way to get an oldie going. The whole point of this is for oldies, I haven’t made it for young ones, but for oldies it’s very, very useful’

From curved-back squats which release the spine, to touching your knee with your nose, the former West End star said the exercises are achievable for women of any age.

And they are best done before breakfast, Dame Gillian said, to get the blood flowing around the body.

As well as her morning work out routine, Dame Gillian sticks to a strict died to stay healthy and in shape

The routine is inspired by Dame Gillian's career as a dancer, choreographer and director

Every morning, Dame Gillian exercises for 40 minutes before doing anything else with her day

First
 you loosen up the spine and the side. You do that by standing and 
releasing your back. You stand with your feet hip width apart, bum in 
and you start to lower.

Then
 you release the back and when you get all the way down to the floor you
 straighten the legs. And then you come up, bone by bone by bone.

When you are back to standing, shrug your shoulders, again and again and again and shake it all out.

Next,
 tense up all your muscles, think about how everything went wrong 
yesterday and you say “it doesn’t matter” and let it all out.

Make
 a box with your arms, like a picture, and twist round to the left side,
 and round to the right side, keeping the hips square. Now you’re ready to get on the floor.

Sitting
 on the floor bring your feet in together to touch, so your legs are 
making a diamond shape and press down gently on the knees. That helps to
 open up the crotch muscles.

Then
 lying down on your back, imagine you’re on a pulley and pull yourself 
up and back down again. That’s working all the way along the core. Do 
about 8 of them with a curved back and then do it again with a straight 
back.

Sitting
 up, open the legs as wide as they will go and then crawl your hands 
along the floor so that your torso gets as close to the floor as 
possible. Do the same on each leg, walking your way down to the toes.

Then
 bend the legs and twist them, so the left is bent in front of you and 
the right slightly to your side. Twist the torso and open up the arms 
like train signals. Then you bring the right arm to the left knee and 
follow it with your whole body, say “good morning knee” and repeat on 
the other side.

Finally,
 taken from yoga, hug the legs close to you and rock backwards and 
forwards as hard as you can. That’s a really good one for shaking it all
 up.

Like any good teacher, of course, Dame Gillian follows the programme rigorously herself. And on any given morning she can be found in her living room, going through a 40-minute routine of stretches and toning exercises with Mr Land – who joins her under duress, she joked. 

‘I get up, I do my breathing exercises,’ Dame Gillian said. ‘I get my back going, I get my waist twisting. It’s difficult for me to get on the floor, I’ve got two metal hips and a foot that has got nails to keep it together. So I don’t just fall, I go slowly, but even then it’s very ungainly, with my hip, it looks terrible.

But I thought no, we have to leave it [in the DVD], because if oldies see it, they’ve probably got something that’s gone. Then there’s a lot of floor work, inspired by Cats. And it’s all been woven in with the jazz work I do and the classical.’

As well as her exercises, Dame Gillian follows a strict diet, which is a throw-back to her days on the stage.She starts her mornings with a glass of hot lime – lemon is too acidic for her dancer’s joints – and after her work out she eats a breakfast of crushed kiwi, gluten-free oats, cinnamon and cayenne pepper, all topped with some water and baked in the oven.

Lunch and dinner will be a baked potato and salad or veal escalope with green vegetables – she follows the Hay Diet and never mixes carbohydrates and protein.

And she never eats fruit after 6pm, while sugar is strictly prohibited.

It is a regime she has followed for most of her adult life, making small changes along the way as she has aged.

In fact the only time she relented from it was last year when she suffered a particularly severe bout of pneumonia, which saw her physically unable to exercise and at one point coming close to death.

Around the same time she appeared in a documentary about older women, in which she performed some of the exercises she follows. And after being inundated by letters from viewers wanting to know more about her routine, Dame Gillian decided to make the DVD.

She said: ‘What it led to was all the ancient people looking at me, because I do some exercises that are perfectly normal to me, wake up work out, which I have to do every day of my life otherwise I wouldn’t be able to do my job. I need to keep fit, limber. And it led to a whole spate of letters from older people saying “isn’t there something for us? This is what we want, we don’t want all that other stuff”.’

‘Although it’s quite obvious that I am not young, I don’t look as old as I am either,’ added the Dame, who became known as the ‘wartime ballerina’ after beginning her career aged 17. ‘This body has been dancing since it was eight years old, without a stop.’
