Winnie-the-Pooh has been voted the best-loved children's book of the past 150 years.

The 1926 classic by AA Milne was the first volume of stories about Christopher Robin, Piglet, Eeyore, Kanga, Roo and the 'bear of very little brain'.

It follows the adventures of naive but steadfast Pooh and his friends in the Hundred-Acre Wood, which was based on Ashdown Forest, Sussex, close to where Milne owned a country home.

Second place in the poll of more than 2,500 adults went to Lewis Carroll's psychedelic tale Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865), followed by the Very Hungry Caterpillar (1969) by U.S. author Eric Carle.

In fifth place, The Gruffalo by Julia Donaldson, published in 1999 and about a monster’s encounter with a little brown mouse, is the most recent book on a list dominated by British writers.

No books published since 2000 made it in to the top 10 results of a YouGov poll commissioned by John Lewis and Barnardo’s.

The rest of the top 10 include The Hobbit (1937), in fourth place, Black Beauty (1877), in seventh, Treasure Island (1883), in the eighth slot and in tenth place The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe (1950).

The results were published as Doctor Who star Peter Capaldi launched Story Time with Barnado’s and John Lewis, to promote reading and support vulnerable children in the UK.

Capaldi said: 'Being read to as a child is something most of us take for granted but for many of the children Barnardo’s supports, storytelling and communicating are skills that their parents don’t have.

'I would encourage people across the country to embrace storytelling, bury your head in a good book and donate as much as you can through Story Time in aid of Barnardo’s.

'You’ll be helping the charity reach out to parents of some of the UK’s most vulnerable children and ensuring they build the confidence and knowledge to help their little one thrive.'
