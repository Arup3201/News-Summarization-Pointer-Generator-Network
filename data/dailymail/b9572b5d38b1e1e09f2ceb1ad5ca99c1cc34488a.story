A widower was left devastated after losing a sentimental recording of his late wife’s voice in a phone service upgrade.

Stan Beaton, 68, from Mirfield, West Yorkshire, said he had been assured by Virgin Media that his much-treasured answer machine message form his wife, Ruby, was safe.

However, following technical changes to his landline, the recording had disappeared from the system last December.

Mr Beaton was shocked after being told the message, which was recorded on the machine over 14 years ago, had been deleted and was lost forever.

 Mr Beaton was left devastated after being told Ruby's message, which was recorded on the machine more than 14 years ago, had been deleted and was lost forever. She died from stomach cancer in 2003

'Anytime I felt low, I knew I always had her voice near but now it is gone,' Mr Beaton, a retired forklift truck driver, said.

'I could not tell you how many times I listened to the message. It was just nice to hear her voice once again. In the early days, it would be every day but the hurt eases but it never goes away,' he said.

When Virgin made some alterations to his service on December 20, Mr Beaton called technical support and was assured his wife's voice was safe.

He later found out that he had been misinformed by the company and his wife's simple answer machine message, which asked callers to leave their name and number, was gone.

Mr Beaton said that losing the recording of his wife was especially difficult to take since it happened just before Christmas, with the festive season bringing back fond memories.

His wife Ruby, who worked at Fox's Biscuits in Batley, died from stomach cancer in May 2003, aged 63. She had previously recovered from breast cancer.

Ruby had recorded the phone's welcome message two years before her death, and it was stored on the couple's landline phone.

Mr Beaton had even refused to move from Virgin Media, despite a better deal elsewhere, due to the fact the answer phone message would have been deleted.

He said: 'Her death left a void in my life. I always used to come in and dial 1471, just because I felt like listening to her but I am unable to do this anymore. I tried to record it myself over the years but I am not the most technical person and could never hear Ruby's voice when I tried.

'To lose something so precious, "sorry" doesn't mean a thing. These big companies say they care about their customers but they don't really care about you at all. 

Virgin Media has called Mr Beaton to apologise while confirming their engineers tried everything to recover the message

'I know I won't be the only one who this may have happened to. However, they say their engineers are unable to recover Ruby's message which is something I just simply have to accept.'

Virgin Media have called Mr Beaton to apologise while confirming their engineers tried everything to recover the message.

Mr Beaton has been offered Sky Sports channels free for a year and the company pledges to make a donation to Mr Beaton's favourite charities to make amends for the deletion of the message.

He named Cancer Research, Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital and cleft palate charity Operation Smile, all of which he donates to regularly.

A Virgin Media spokeswoman said: 'The voicemail message was lost when we migrated the service to a new platform during a planned upgrade.

'One of the agents in our contact centre incorrectly advised Mr Beaton his voicemail message was safe.

'We've apologised to Mr Beaton for this and for any distress the loss of this message has caused.'

Mr Beaton says he is still waiting to hear confirmation regarding the donation to his charities.
