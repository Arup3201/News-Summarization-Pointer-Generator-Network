Internet celebrity Jessi Smiles, known for her videos on Vine, has received a death threat and heated accusations on Twitter from fans of her ex-boyfriend -- and fellow Vine star -- Curtis Lepore. Lepore has been charged with raping his Smiles while she was sleeping in late August.

One death threat leveled against Smiles, retrieved by Hollywood Life, is particularly chilling.

Using a Twitter account that has since been removed, a user wrote 'so jessi smiles told people Curtis raped her while they were dating .. NO **** YOU JESSI I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN YOU LITTLE *****'

Jessi Smiles has been the victim of death threats and numerous insults since alleging ex-boyfriend Curtis Lepore raped her in late August

Lepore fans have called Smiles 'crazy as ****' and a '*****'

Other Lepore fans have used strong insults against the digital celebrity.

'Jessi Smiles is a backstabbing *****,' writes one user, the website reports.

Another Twitter user claimed Smiles' accusations were simply for attention.

'jessi smiles is a lying bitch lmao i never liked her, I'm pretty sure she's doing this for attention,' the tweet reads.

Smiles also seems to be losing some of her fans on the social media site. 

'Unfollowed jessi smiles dumb **** ******* with my boy Curtis,' posted one user.

Fans of Smiles have shown their support on Twitter, calling out the threats levelled against her.

'Jessi Smiles from Vine is receiving death threats because she is facing her ex in court for raping her... I'm really at a loss for words...' wrote one user.

Another said 'Jessi Smiles is attacked with death threats after reporting her rape. And people wonder why most rapes go unreported.'

Smiles herself seems to be ignoring the death threats, after posting a cryptic message on Twitter.

'I've said it before and I'll say it again...you just have to love the love more than you hate the hate,' she said.

Bad romance: Vine star Curtis Lepore (left) was arrested last October and charged with raping his former girlfriend and fellow online celebrity Jessi Smiles (right) over the summer

Love gone awry: TMZ reported that the incident happened while Smiles was visiting Lepore in Los Angeles just a few weeks into their relationship

TMZ reported
 on Thursday that Lepore was arrested in October and released on 
$100,000 bail. On Tuesday, the rape suspect entered a not guilty plea in
 a Los Angeles court.

The 
celebrity gossip site reported that the alleged sexual assault took 
place in late August while Smiles, of Florida, was visiting her 
then-boyfriend Lepore in Los Angeles.

During her stay, the couple who had met on Vine just weeks earlier called it quits, TMZ said.

Smiles spent a few more days in L.A. filming a video for the popular social media forum, but suffered a concussion during shooting.

Sources told the site that Lepore allegedly offered his former paramour his help while she was recovering from her injury.

According to the alleged victim, one day Curtis came over to visit her while she was sleeping, and that is when he allegedly raped her.

MailOnline does not usually name victims of sexual abuse, but Smiles, whose real name is Jessica Vazquez, gave TMZ the go-ahead to publicly identify her.

Both Lepore and Smiles have addressed the incident on their respective Twitter and Vine accounts.

Serious allegations: According to reports, Smiles was recovering from a concussion when Lepore came over and allegedly raped her as she slept

Rise to stardom: Lepore became web celebrity by creating hundreds of quirky and silly 6-second videos and uploading them on Vine

The day after the alleged incident, the blonde beauty wrote to her followers: ’be careful of who you trust. Always be cautious for your safety. Be strong and don't let your guard down...’

On Thursday, Lepore offered a response to TMZ’s report about the rape allegations, tweeting: 'There are 2 sides to every story. When the time is right I'll have something to say. For now, don't rush to judge.'

He further expanded on the subject in a 6-second Vine video, telling his fans: ‘Things aren’t always what they seem. I am not allowed to talk about what’s going on right now. In the meantime, don’t rush to judge. There are two sides to every story. When the time is right, I will have something to say.’

Lepore, a native a Syracuse, New York, who had previously sang in the hard-core band GHOSTxSHIP, rose to Internet stardom by creating hundreds of quirky and silly 6-second videos and uploading them on Vine, Syracuse.com reported.

The content-sharing mobile app owned by Twitter was first introduced a year ago, drawing millions of members worldwide.

Response: Lepore released a video statement on his Vine page, reminding the public that each story has two sides and asking people to avoid rushing to judgment

Lepore has emerged as one of the biggest stars on the increasingly popular site, boasting 3.4million followers.

Smiles has made a name for herself on the social media platform by posting short clips showing her dancing, playing guitar or performing brief self-deprecating skits. She has 2.7million followers.

The two did not know each other before joining Vine. Smiles and Lepore exchanged flirtatious videos last summer before deciding to meet in person in New York City in early August 2013.

The emerging web stars turned their first face-to-face date into a Vine meetup, inviting other users to join them in Manhattan’s Washington Square Park.

Celebrity breakup: The young couple called it quits just weeks after their romantic first date, leaving their fans baffled and disappointed

A video from the event shows the happy couple exchanging a passionate first kiss in front of hundreds of ecstatic fans to mark the start of their romance.  

But the relationship was not to last. Just weeks after the romantic encounter in the sun-drenched Manhattan park, Vine’s first celebrity couple abruptly split up, leaving their followers to wonder what had gone wrong.

Hollywood Life reported that between late October and early November, the typically bubbly Miss Smiles sent out a series of unusually dark and unsettling tweets.

One of the messages read: 'I don't feel like living on this planet today. Goodbye.'
