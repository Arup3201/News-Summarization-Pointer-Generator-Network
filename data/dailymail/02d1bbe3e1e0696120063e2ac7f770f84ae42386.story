'Conspiracy': Carole Waugh's body was found in a south London garage in August, four months after the 50-year-old went missing

Eight people have now been charged with fraud offences relating to murdered oil executive Carole Waugh after two more men were arrested.

Ms Waugh, 50, was last seen alive in London in April, and several fraudulent transactions involving her bank account were made after her disappearance.

The millionairess's decomposing body was only discovered in a lock-up in south London in August, four months after she had been stabbed to death.

She had worked for an oil company in Libya and was reported missing from Marylebone, central London, in May.

Yesterday, Scotland Yard said that 55-year-old Derek Eastham and 39-year-old Elie Khoury, both from London, had been charged with conspiracy to defraud ‘in connection with the investigation into Carole Waugh’s murder’.

Eastham faces a further charge of possessing counterfeit currency. Both have been bailed to appear before Croydon Magistrates Court next year.

Police said later that Susan O'Shea, 61, of Sunset Avenue, Woodford Green, had also been charged with conspiracy to defraud in connection with the investigation into the murder.

She is accused of conspiring with others between April 15 and August 1 to defraud banks and other financial institutions.

She has also been bailed to appear at Croydon Magistrates' Court on January 10.

Five people have previously been charged with fraud offences in connection with the investigation.

Two of them - Rakesh Bhayani, 40, of Wembley, and Nicholas Kutner, 47, of no fixed abode - have been charged with her murder.

Two men have been charged with conspiracy to defraud in connection with the investigation into the murder of wealthy former oil executive Carole Waugh, Scotland Yard said.

Miss Waugh’s body was found with a single stab wound inside a car in a lock-up garage in south-west London, on August 2.

Eastham, of Westminster, was charged yesterday while Khoury, of Paddington, was charged today.

Single wound: Two of the five people previously arrested by investigators into the alleged fraud were also charged with Ms Waugh's murder

The outline of the alleged offence is that, between April 15 and August 1, Eastham conspired with others to defraud banks and other financial institutions and was in possession of criminal property, namely a quantity of counterfeit currency.

Khoury is alleged to have conspired with others to defraud banks and other financial institutions between the same dates.

Both have been bailed to appear at Croydon Magistrates’ Court on January 10.

Ms Waugh, originally from Durham, was reported missing by her family on May 7. Her body was only found four months later, by which time her body was so badly decomposed she could only be identified by her dental records.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
