Frankie Mariano's excellent early-season form for Castleford has been rewarded with the versatile second rower signing a new two-year deal.

Mariano joined the Tigers from Wakefield for the start of the current First Utility Super League season, and has been an ever-present in the side that is fourth in the standings, scoring three tries.

And ahead of this weekend's Magic Weekend, where Mariano will come against his former side in Manchester, the 27-year-old has committed himself to Castleford until the end of 2016.

'I feel really comfortable,' Mariano said. 'I've never felt as comfortable as I do now in this team which is a big factor and it's showing in my game.

'I wanted to play in every game, but it's not something I expected with being in a brand new side and having to work my way in.

'Obviously I've done something right for Daryl Powell to keep playing me and this is exactly what I needed and wanted. Hopefully I can carry on, keep progressing and keep getting better.'

Powell added: "He has continued to improve throughout the year and has lots of room to develop his game even further.

'He is a big athlete with potential to play in three positions, which makes him a valuable member of our squad.'
