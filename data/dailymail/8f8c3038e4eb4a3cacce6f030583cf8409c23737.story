Tesco shoppers across the country cleared shelves of thousands of chocolate bars after a mistake saw the treats being sold at just a fraction of their usual price.

Customers filled their baskets and trolleys after a fresh supermarket glitch saw tubes of chocolate Smarties sold for just 5p, Kit Kat Chunky bars went for just 10p and peppermint Aeros for 12p.

The latest blunder comes just days 
after Tesco mistakenly sold Terry's Chocolate Oranges, which retail for
£2.75, for just 29p each.

On that occasion one customer bought 192 of the Oranges for just £57 - saving a staggering £471.

Sweet deal: Chocolate in 1,285 Tesco Express stores across the UK was mistakenly under priced, the second price blunder in days

Customers were visiting stores in their 
droves after the mistake was posted on an internet message board by an 
eagle-eyed shopper. 

One of today's fortunate shoppers claimed they had bought 330 tubes of Smarties while another bought 120 tubes and said they would send them to troops abroad.

Others who filled their shopping baskets said they would use the treats to hand out at Halloween.

The latest glitch, available only at the supermarket giant's 1,285 Express stores, was first flagged up on money saving 
forum hotukdeals.com on Tuesday morning.

Smarties deal: Smarties tubes, normally sold for 45p, were on offer for just 5p in over a thousand Tesco Express stores in the UK

Have a price break: Have a Kit Kat Chunky for 10p - 35p less than usual pricing

Minty fresh deal: Peppermint Aeros went on sale for 12p as opposed to 40p

Within minutes people posted photos of their receipts - and it wasn't long before the page soared in popularity, hitting 720 degrees on the website's 'temperature gauge'.

The glitch happened after a 
buy-one-get-one-free deal was incorrectly applied to chocolates that had
already been discounted by half price.

That meant two packets of five tubes
of Smarties cost 52p, two packs of five Kit Kat Chunky bars cost 98p 
and two packs of four Aeros cost 98p.

One person posted online: 'I know it 
works on the Smarties and Aero as I have cleared the shelves in all 
Express stores within a 15 mile radius of me.'

Internet bragging: Shoppers posted receipts on Facebook showing their massive savings

Another posted: '330 tubes of smarties, luvvit' while one said: 'Have just bought 24 packs.... Making up parcels to send to the troops for Christmas. Thanks.'

One wrote: 'A lady had a whole basket full on the check out, must have been 20 plus, as she paid the manager came over and cancelled the transaction and said she could only buy six.

'He then took the rest off the shelf....made me laugh.'

One said: 'This is such a great deal. Just popped out and bought 20 packets.

'Came to £10.40 then reduced to £5.20. Awesome for trick or treaters, also good for the school kids as rewards for good work.

Today a spokesman for the supermarket confirmed the mistake was operating for a short time at the company's Express stores.

She said: 'This was a small glitch in a minority of stores which has been corrected.'
