The Royal 
Box had illustrious names from Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Richard Branson
 to FA chairman Greg Dyke, back early from Brazil and perhaps looking 
for tips on how to turn a British sport beleaguered by underachievement 
into something that can be a contender, not an embarrassment.

But
 the star spectator in the fanciest attire was undoubtedly  Ilie Nastase
 who wore an  old-style Romanian military jacket. John McEnroe joked 
that he looked like a member of the Village People.

Murray’s win means he has reached the quarter-finals for the seventh successive year. The last time he failed to reach the last eight was in 2007, when he missed the tournament through injury.

Since his first Wimbledon quarter-final in 2008, he has performed as well or better in every successive year, reaching the semi-finals in 2009, 2010 and 2011, the final in 2012 and winning last year.

Murray has not dropped a set in four matches, winning in straight sets against David Goffin, Blaz Rola and Roberto Bautista Agut before Anderson.  This is the third time he has reached the Wimbledon quarter-finals without dropping a set, the two previous occasions being 2010 (when he made the semis) and 2013 (winner).

He has dropped just 32 games in four matches this year.

Murray’s victory means he extends his record as the leading British man in the history of tennis in terms of Grand Slam match wins. His tally now stands at 130 wins and 31 losses in 34 Slam singles tournaments (two wins, Wimbledon 2014 still to finish).

Fred Perry by comparison had 101 wins and 15 losses while Tim Henman’s win-loss record at Slams was 98-49.

Superior: Andy Murray was better than Kevin Anderson in practically every department

Murray’s all-round game was superior to Anderson’s, with most aspects of his game better than the South African. Murray had 73% of first serves in (Anderson 65%) and Murray won 81% of those points (Anderson 64%).

Murray also out-aced the giant Anderson 11-9. Murray’s forehand returns in (76%) were much better than Anderson’s (57%), as were his backhand returns in (70% versus 64%).

Both players won 88% of points played at the net, but Murray won more from the baseline (51% versus 33%). Murray hit 49 winners to Anderson’s 41.
