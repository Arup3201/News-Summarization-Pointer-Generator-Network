It could not have been a more perfect engagement gift from a proud groom to his blue-blooded, dog-loving wife-to-be.

When writer William Cash presented society milliner Lady Laura Cathcart with an impossibly cute £800 pug, she was just as thrilled  as he knew she would be.

That, however, was when things began to go horribly wrong.

Cash, a friend of actress Elizabeth Hurley, was left panic-stricken when he lost the pug – a rare 14-week-old bitch called Damson – in a storm a fortnight before the wedding.

Lady Laura, 29, whose father is  the 7th Earl of a pug-obsessed clan that dates back to the 12th Century, was on her hen night in Essex, leaving her fiance to look after Damson and their four-year-old labrador, Cressetta.

But while Cash worked upstairs at the couple’s moated Elizabethan manor – Upton Cressett Hall in Shropshire – the kitchen door, warped by the February floods, blew off, and the two dogs fled.

‘I panicked because Laura was  due home about four hours later,’ admits William, the son of Eurosceptic Tory MP Bill Cash.

After broadcasting an SOS over the airwaves of Radio Shropshire, he also enlisted the help of his neighbour, Lucy Birley, former wife of pop  star Bryan Ferry. Her two lurchers hunted in vain for the runaways.

‘The labrador eventually came home with her tail between her legs,’ says William.

‘But we never saw Damson again. I all but drained the moat but to no avail. A fox or a hawk must have got her.

In the middle of it all, Laura rang me to say, “I’ll be back by 7pm at the latest. I can’t wait to see my pug.” ’

William,
 47, has previously been married to jewellery heiress Ilaria Bulgari and
 Mick Jagger’s ex-lover Vanessa Neumann – and he feared that losing 
Damson could cost him  a third wife. So he did what any serial groom 
would do: he lied.

In an episode that could have been plucked from the Ben Stiller comedy Meet The Parents or the Coen brothers’ hit Inside Llewyn Davis, William quickly tracked down a lookalike pug for £1,000 on the internet and set off in his Jeep on a  75-minute drive to a housing estate in Kingstanding, Birmingham.

‘I was so terrified I even rang up a minicab company to give me an escort,’ he says.

‘We ended up at 4pm in this rough-looking cul-de-sac which was guarded by a big beefy gent covered in tattoos. And there was me – £1,000 in fifties stuffed into the pockets of my Barbour.

‘I thought, “This is it, only an idiot would fall for this scam. I’m not going to make it to the altar – they’re going to find me in the back garden of some nasty terrace, bonked on the head.” ’

William need not have worried. Fifteen minutes later, he was the proud owner of Thimble, a six-week-old Kennel Club-registered pug.

‘I raced home and got there with minutes to spare. When Laura arrived, the first thing she said was, “I want to give my pug a big hug.” Silently, I handed her over, fearing the worst but hoping for the best.

‘I tried to brazen it out but Laura wasn’t having it. She said straight away, “She’s lost a lot of weight, have you not been feeding her? Why has she got a white chest? And why is she so much more black? Is this really my pug? Have you killed my pug?”

'For Laura, pugs come first. Pugs, hats and then – hopefully – me. I had to come clean.

‘She was very upset but, thankfully, she and Thimble fell totally in love. Laura did realise that I was at least, two weeks before the wedding, trying to make her happy.

‘And I think she was secretly impressed that I had managed to track down a replacement so quickly – black pug bitches are notoriously rare. The first one took us four months to find.’

William is, however, back on probation after another accident almost put paid to the second dog.

‘Thimble is 14 weeks old now – the same age as Damson when she disappeared – and she’s a very mischievous, feisty dog. I was walking her along Pimlico Road in London the other day when she darted off into traffic.

'I had to rugby-tackle her. One lost pug was bad enough – I couldn’t weather a second.’

William proposed to Laura at the church set in the grounds of his home last September. ‘It was all very romantic,’ he says.

‘Her favourite flowers are thistles so I lined  the font with them and hid the ring. Then we rang the bells.’ At their wedding last month, Hurley’s son Damian, 12, acted as pageboy.

‘I did think about telling the pug story in my groom’s speech,’ says William. ‘But then I looked up and saw all Laura’s family – all those pug-loving faces – and I bottled it.’
