The dreaded polar vortex will rear its frigid head this year despite previous predictions to the contrary, an expert Michigan forecaster said Thursday, just as New York City officials warned Gothamites to brace for the first snow of the season.

Michigan meteorologist Mark Torregrossa revealed his predictions on Mlive.com, where he writes 'the polar vortex is already dropping farther south than normal.'

His report goes head to head with one out of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration just last month, which suggested this year's cold months simply won't be as historically bone-chilling as last winter.

Chilled: Things weren't looking good for the Midwestern US on Thursday afternoon as high temps were below freezing in some unfortunate places--Minneapolis and Chicago among them

Polar vortex? A massive arctic bubble ahead of a polar vortex expected to settle near Hudson Bay by Tuesday was set to force temperatures down to around 10F below normal for this time of years just about everywhere except the West Coast, Southwest and Southern Florida

Sign of things to come: New York City, still shell-shocked from last year's record chills, already had snow on the way Friday. The folks at NYC Sanitation included a photo, presumably from last year, as an unsettling reminder

As of Thursday, with Midwest temps poised to dip to record lows for November and snow already threatening the Eastern Seaboard, it appeared Torregrossa's was the forecast to follow. 

Accuweather.com predicts an 80 percent chance of snow and ice would clog travel up I-95 from northern New Jersey into southern New England starting Thursday and stretching into Friday.  

NYC Sanitation issue a 'snow alert' for 8pm THursday. 'Salt spreaders are loaded and ready to be deployed,' they tweeted. 'Drive carefully.'

New York can expect about a half-inch of the white stuff to pile up Thursday. 

Meanwhile, a massive arctic bubble ahead of a polar vortex was set to force temperatures down to around 10F below normal for this time of years just about everywhere except the West Coast, Southwest and Southern Florida.

'It looks like we are heading for a much colder than normal start to the winter,' Torregrossa writes.

Pointing toward a 'long expected' El Nino this winter, NOAA forecaster Mike Halpert just last month wrote:

'A repeat of last winter is not particularly likely.'

We can hope NOAA has the more accurate predictions, but until then, expect a bracingly cold weekend in much of the U.S.

The Arctic chill is gripping the Rockies and Upper Midwest - and it's crawling east. 

A new study says that as the world gets warmer, parts of North America, Europe and Asia could see more frequent and stronger visits of that cold air. Researchers say that's because of shrinking ice in the seas off Russia.

Normally, the polar vortex is penned in the Arctic. But at times it escapes and wanders south, bringing with it a bit of Arctic super chill.

That can happen for several reasons, and the new study suggests that one of them occurs when ice in northern seas shrinks, leaving more water uncovered.

Normally, sea ice keeps heat energy from escaping the ocean and entering the atmosphere. When there's less ice, more energy gets into the atmosphere and weakens the jet stream, the high-altitude river of air that usually keeps Arctic air from wandering south, said study co-author Jin-Ho Yoon of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash. So the cold air escapes instead.

That happened relatively infrequently in the 1990s, but since 2000 it has happened nearly every year, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal

A visual representation of the dreaded polar vortex. Is it coming and do we have melting sea ice to blame?

Sharp drops in temperature are expected in other parts of the U.S. in the coming days, thanks to a powerful weather system that hit Alaska with hurricane-force winds over the weekend before blanketing several state ins snow.

Dangerously cold weather was expected to linger until Thursday in eastern Montana, where temperatures could reach as low as negative 30 degrees. Denver's high was only was 5 degrees on Wednesday, a day after the snow-covered city broke a nearly century-old record for the lowest temperature ever recorded on a Nov. 11.

The frigid air was expected to crawl into the Appalachians, mid-South and the East Coast by Thursday. Forecasters have issued freeze and cold-weather warnings across parts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.

In Billings, Montana, where temperatures fell from the high 60s into the single digits on Tuesday, Patsy Kimmel said she was warned about the weather before arriving from Oklahoma to celebrate her 70th birthday with family.

'Yesterday I was wearing sandals and a short-sleeve shirt, and today I'm wearing a coat and scarf and turtleneck and sweatshirt and gloves,' she said. 

Snow and ice: Accuweather.com predicts an 80 percent chance of snow and ice would clog travel up I-95 from northern New Jersey into southern New England starting Thursday and stretching into Friday.

Get ready, New York: The Arctic chill is gripping the Rockies and Upper Midwest - and it's crawling east. Sharp drops in temperature are expected in other parts of the U.S. in the coming days, thanks to a powerful weather system that hit Alaska with hurricane-force winds over the weekend before blanketing several state in snow

Temperatures fell more than 30 degrees overnight in northern Illinois, from a high of 58 on Tuesday to 26 degrees on Wednesday. Similar swings hit Oklahoma City, where temperatures went from 80 degrees Monday to a low of 30 on Tuesday.

In the Dakotas, wind chills made it feel like 20 below in some places. But that was good news for Action Mechanical Inc. of Rapid City, South Dakota, a heating and ventilation business that was doing booming trade.

'Bang! We get this arctic blast, and it just opens the floodgates,' said John Hammond Jr., a department head. 'We're behind right now as we're sitting here talking.'

Parts of Michigan's Upper Peninsula were buried in more than 3 feet of snow on Wednesday, with more snow forecast through the weekend, along with temperatures that dipped in the 20s and 30s. Up to 18 inches fell in northern Wisconsin, while parts of central Minnesota saw more than 16 inches of snow.

Many roads were snow-covered and slippery Wednesday in the Upper Peninsula, where residents are accustomed to snowy conditions. Of his drive into work, National Weather Service meteorologist Justin Titus said that roads were 'just rutted out and kind of felt like you were driving over a washboard.' 

Even chillier: Tonight will get even worse. As the sun sets, snow was expected to push east and dust the Eastern Seaboard from northern New Jersey up through southern New England

Friday night will chill much of the United States below typical temperatures as well. Only the Southwest and Southern Florida can expect to be spared

A Michigan weather expert predicts the dreaded arctic phenomenon could be a common sight in the States this winter

The Midwestern U.S. will experienced temps 10F below average in the coming days

The prediction comes despite previous NOAA forecasts to the contrary and just as New York City is bracing for half-inch snowfall Thursday

These would be the first flurries of the season in winter weary and it's only November
