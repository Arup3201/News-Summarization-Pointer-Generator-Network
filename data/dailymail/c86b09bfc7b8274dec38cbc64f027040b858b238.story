The Football Association have approved and ratified the Class of ´92´s takeover of non-league club Salford City, in a deal that sees Singapore billionaire Peter Lim assume a 50 per cent stake in the club.

Sportsmail exclusively revealed in September that the five former Manchester United stars - Gary and Phil Neville, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Nicky Butt - had agreed to forge a remarkable partnership with Lim.

Under the terms of the deal, each of the five players retain 10 per cent of the club, meaning that the Class of ´92 will collectively maintain an equal share of the power. Lim, however, is the leading individual shareholder after acquiring 50 per cent of the club.

Lim, 61, is estimated by Forbes to boast a net worth of £1.5billion and he is believed to have made a bid worth in excess of £300m to buy Liverpool in 2010, before the Merseyside club was sold to Fenway Sports Group.

Despite his flirtation with Liverpool, Lim is a lifelong Manchester United supporter and he is believed to enjoy a long-standing professional relationship with the former United players.

The five former players agreed a deal to take over Salford in the spring but the application process had been delayed while legal issues were resolved.

Salford are 3rd in the Evo-Stik League Division North but will rise to the top of the table if they are able to win their two games in hand.
