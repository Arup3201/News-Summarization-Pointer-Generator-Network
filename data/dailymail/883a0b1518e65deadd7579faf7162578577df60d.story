The outspoken artist tweeted his thoughts on the epidemic, which has killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa as well as one person in the U.S.

Brown wrote: 'I don't know ... But I think this Ebola epidemic is a form of population control. S*** is getting crazy bruh.'

His first post received nearly 9,500 retweets and has not been deleted by the singer.

It did not take long for people to latch on to Brown's tweet, with dozens of people criticising his odd conspiracy theory. 

Comedian Warren Holstein tweeted: 'Chris Brown tweeted that Ebola is "a form of population control." He should try it.'

Kevin Hildebrand said: 'Let's keep in mind that Chris Brown is a complete idiot, so his theory of Ebola is equal to a rant from a village idiot.'

Wayne Durham tweeted: 'The stupid gene is strong in Chris Brown.'

The U.S. began screening people travelling from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - the worst-hit nations - for Ebola at numerous airports on Saturday.

Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, was the first person to die of Ebola on U.S. soil on Wednesday, after travelling to America from Liberia in September. 

This weekend, a nurse who treated Mr Duncan was confirmed as having Ebola. Nina Pham, 26, from Fort Worth, Texas, is being held in isolation at Texas Presbyterian and is said to be in a stable condition.

The UK is also conducting medical checks on people entering the country, and held a major exercise last week to ensure the emergency services were prepared for a first Ebola case.

The World Health Organization has called the Ebola outbreak 'the most severe, acute health emergency seen in modern times'. 

Nurse Nina Pham, 26, from Fort Worth, Texas, was diagnosed with Ebola this weekend just days after the patient she was treating, Thomas Duncan, died from the virus

There is no vaccine for the virus, with the UN expecting the outbreak to continue for at least three months.

The World Health Organization today called the Ebola outbreak 'the most severe, acute health emergency seen in modern times'.

It added that economic disruption can be curbed if people are educated so they don't make any irrational moves to dodge infection.

WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, citing World Bank figures, said 90 per cent of economic costs of any outbreak 'come from irrational and disorganised efforts of the public to avoid infection.'

'We are seeing, right now, how this virus can disrupt economies and societies around the world,' she said, but added that adequately educating the public was a 'good defense strategy' and would allow governments to prevent economic disruptions.
