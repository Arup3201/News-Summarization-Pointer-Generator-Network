Slowly but surely, signs of the Andy Murray who won Wimbledon last year are starting to re-emerge, as he claimed his second title in four weeks.

The Vienna Open is not SW19 but a remarkable 5-7, 6-2, 7-5 victory over world No 5 David Ferrer gave a reminder of why Murray was a fixture among the so-called Big Four for so long.

At the moment the goal is merely to be in the top eight that will qualify for the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena next month, and he went some way to achieving that by winning in the Austrian capital.

The 27-year-old broke his opponent three times in the final set to see out the match 

In battling back from 3-5 down in the deciding set Murray elevated himself into eighth position in the race to London with two events remaining.

'It will be close,' he rightly cautioned after toppling the indefatigable Spaniard in a match of frequent service breaks by two of the game's great returners.

Barely 100 points separate the Scot, Ferrer and Canada's Milos Raonic in competition for the few remaining slots. Grigor Dimitrov is not out of it either. 

The 250 points that Murray will get as the winner of Vienna are useful but an awful lot can change in the next fortnight with 500 on offer this week in Valencia or Basle and 1000 for the Paris Masters next week.

Matters might yet be made easier if Rafael Nadal withdraws from London to have surgery, something the French Open champion repeated was possible.

Murray could not afford to celebrate too much — 'maybe one glass of champagne tonight, but not more than that' — as he headed straight for Valencia, where he is expected to be reunited with head coach Amelie Mauresmo. It will be his fifth straight tournament in five weeks.

For Murray, Sunday's ranking-points boost will be outweighed by the intangible worth of coming through an extremely tough contest against an opponent who famously never gives it away.

These are the building blocks Murray needs to put in place to return to the top of the game. This was the kind of eye-catching win that has been lacking since his return from back surgery in January. 

It looked as if he had suppressed the difficult Spaniard on this brisk indoor court when he pulled ahead in the second set after a tight opener. 

Murray looked to be cruising when he went 2-0 ahead in the decider, only to concede the next four and get broken again when he had pulled back to 3-4 on serve.

As Ferrer served for the match Murray finally opened his shoulders to hit out in glorious fashion.

At 5-5 he broke with a backhand return winner and served out comfortably, winning with an ace that was initially called out.

And so his late entry was ultimately rewarded. Losing this final would have been a massive blow, given the amount these two took out of each other in a physical battle. 

At this rate there will be a lot of tired bodies by the time the key event in Paris begins a week on Monday.
