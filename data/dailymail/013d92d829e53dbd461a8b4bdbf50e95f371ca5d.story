A beloved father of three was killed in a freak accident on Wednesday when a loose manhole cover crashed through the windshield of the truck he was driving on a New York highway.

José Duran, 35, of Springfield, Mass., was driving west on the Cross Bronx Expressway at about 5:30 a.m. when the sewer cap struck him in the head.

Investigators believe it had been dislodged by another vehicle passing over it.

Duran suffered massive head trauma and was rushed to Lincoln Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

A typical manhole cover weighs around 300 pounds and it is extremely rare that one could be dislodged by a vehicle.

‘That’s a tragic, tragic accident,’ Robert Sinclair, an AAA spokesman told the New York Post. 'I’ve heard of cables shorting out and blowing them into the air, but this is the first I can remember of anything like this.'
