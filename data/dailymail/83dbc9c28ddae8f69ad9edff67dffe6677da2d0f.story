Two Australian surfers have conquered one of the world's biggest and most dangerous waves off the Western Australia coast at the same time - and captured the whole thing on camera.

As if surfing the wave was not a big enough task, fromer pro surfer Mark Mathews, 31, and current pro Taj Burrow, 36, wanted to push surf photography to its limits by shooting the most dangerous image ever taken.

Towed by a jet ski, the pair dropped into the wave known as The Right together on Friday, August 1, reported Redbull.com.

Ferocious: Known as The Right, the wave's barrel can get so large it can easily fit two surfers inside

Going to extreme lengths to complete a life long dream, Mathews filmed the experience which proved just how violent the wave can be.

In the video posted on Rebull.com, it states a photo of a wave of The Right's magnitude has never been attempted.

The footage shows the men surfing the infamous wave's gigantic barrel before crashing down and wiping both men out.

From Mathews' hand-held camera, he was able to catch a bird's eye view from inside the barrel as it began collapsing and swallowing Burrow.

With the ferocity of the beastly wave evident from the footage, The Right is reportedly the last wave in the world that has not be paddled by a surfer and produces more two or three-wave hold downs than any other, which can be deadly.

A wave hold down is when a surfer is held under water by two or three successive waves breaking over them.

Despite the risks, because of The Right's massive barrel, it is ideal for surf photography because it can easily fit two surfers inside it.

During filming, Matthews was wiped out and suffered a gash to his face and ruptured eardrum

In their pursuit for the perfect shot, both surfers encountered the wrath of the wave, with Mathews being dumped and suffering a ruptured eardrum and cut to his face.

While Mathews had previously surfed the wave, Burrow had not.

A full story of the surfer's exploits at The Right will air in a mini-documentary on Redbull.com and Stab Magazine later this month.
