Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, claims the Department of Education does not know if the money it has set aside for places is enough

Under-performing schools could be forced to expand to deal with a chronic shortage of places, MPs warn today.

They say education is at risk because of a lack of planning by the Department for Education.

Some schools may have to turn libraries or music rooms into classrooms or create classrooms  in playgrounds.

The warning comes from the Public Accounts Committee, the latest group to raise concerns about the lack of school places.

In March, a study by the National Audit Office (NAO) warned that by September 2014, an estimated extra 256,000 school places will be needed.

The Department for Education (DfE) has said it is spending £5billion by 2015 on new school places, and that it expects 190,000 extra places will have been created by September.

However the committee’s chairman, former Labour minister Margaret Hodge, claims that the DfE does not know whether this £5billion ‘will be enough to pay for them or even spent to best effect’.

In its report, the PAC says the department and local authorities did not anticipate ‘how much and where pupil numbers were rising early enough and therefore failed to plan adequately for the increased demand’.

The report warns that the need to increase the number of school places should not be done at the expense of quality.

Mrs Hodge said: ‘It does not take much imagination to realise that educational opportunities and standards might be diminished if specialist areas, such as music rooms and libraries, are converted into classrooms, poorly performing schools expanded or playgrounds used to house children in overcrowded demountables.’

Schools minister David Laws replied that the Coalition was ‘clearing up the mess left by Ed Balls and Labour when they were in government’.

He said: ‘Margaret Hodge is right that there is a severe need to ensure there are enough school places but she has failed to pin the blame where it belongs – at the door of the last Government of which she was a member.’
