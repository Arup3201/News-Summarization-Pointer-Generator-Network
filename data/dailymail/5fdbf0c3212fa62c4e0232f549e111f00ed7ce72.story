Christmas miracle: This one-year-old Lhasa apso dubbed Miracle was found alive inside a Dumpster on Long Island 18 hours after she was stuffed inside a plastic bag and thrown out

A Long Island shelter worker has been arraigned on animal cruelty and abuse charges after a puppy was found dirty and matted inside a Dumpster.

Kennel attendant Michael Papini, 30, was ordered held on $250 cash bail or $500 bond. He did not enter a plea Saturday.

Authorities say the female Lhasa apso  nicknamed ‘Miracle’ by her rescuers was found wearing a pink collar and leash in a commercial trash bin outside a gas station in West Islip early Christmas Eve.

Papini was identified as the suspect after news outlets aired surveillance footage showing a driver dumping a black plastic bag at the gas station nearly 20 hours earlier.

Authorities said Papini, who worked as a janitor at the shelter, was paid $250 by an acquaintance to take her two dogs off her hands because she could no longer take care of them.

Instead of bringing the pooches to the kennel as promised, police say Papini let one dog, a poodle, out into the street, Newsday reported. The animal has not been seen since.

He then allegedly stuffed the second pet, the grey and white Lhasa apso, into a cardboard animal carrier, placed the container inside a plastic bag and dumped it into a trash bin at a gas station in West Islip just before 8am Monday.

Devious: SPCA officials say Papini was paid $250 by an acquittance to take her two dogs to the shelter, but instead he let one of them go into the street and dumped the grey and white pooch in the garbage

About 18 hours later, a homeless man rummaging through the garbage bin found the dog and called SPCA at 2.10am. 

Officials believe the pup was able to chew her way out of the plastic bag by the time she was rescued from the bin, her fur filthy and matted.

She was taken to a veterinary clinic and was said to be in good health.

Papini was arrested at his home in Lindenhurst Friday after police were tipped off about his whereabouts by someone who had recognized him from surveillance footage that aired on TV.

Papini's attorney told CBS New York her client has no criminal record. The kennel worker has been suspended from his job without pay in the wake of the incident.

He was charged with felony aggravated animal cruelty, two counts of abandonment of animals, two counts of animal abuse and one count of petty larceny.

‘For somebody to take a live animal, put it in a box and black plastic bag, for somebody to find it -- it's a million-to-one shot,’ said SPCA Chief Ropy Gross. ‘It's a miracle for that dog to survive.’

The Islip Animal Shelter has released a statement saying that the incident involving Papini does not reflect the treatment of animals from its dedicated staff and volunteers.
