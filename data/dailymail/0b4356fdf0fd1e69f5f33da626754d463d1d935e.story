Australians who can't afford to buy property can invest in the real estate market with as little as $66 thanks to a new start up.

The recently launched BrickX allows people to buy 'bricks' or sections of properties and profit from rental returns without having to go to auction, pay stamp duty or get a mortgage.

BrickX CEO Darren Patterson said the idea behind the business was to make real estate investment more straightforward and achievable.

BrickX buys properties – with a focus on one-bed studios and two-bedroom apartments in 'blue chip' suburbs – and makes them available on its online platform

'If you've never been able to have a mortgage or save for a deposit to get your first property, this is a chance for those individuals to share in the benefits of property investment,' Mr Patterson said.

BrickX buys properties – with a focus on one-bed studios and two-bedroom apartments in 'blue chip' suburbs – and makes them available on its online platform.

Once an investor has registered and undergone the required financial checks, they can search through properties and can look at a detailed data profile with information including the property's rental yield, capital growth over the past five years, pictures, council rates and other attached fees.

If they find a property they want to invest in, they can buy one or more 'bricks' worth up to 5 per cent of the property's total value.

Each property is in an individual trust, and each 'brick' is a unit within that trust which acts like a share.

'You can buy and sell them, and it can go up or down based on the value of the property,' Mr Patterson said.

'You get a share of the rent minus other costs, just like a dividend you get as a stock trader on the ASX.'

BrickX currently has two properties available for investment – a one-bedroom unit in Enmore in inner-city Sydney, which costs $66 for one brick, and a two-bedroom apartment with Harbour views in Mosman on Sydney's North Shore, which costs $126 per brick.

But Mr Patterson is looking for properties in Melbourne and has plans to expand into more suburbs in Sydney including Bondi, Manly and areas like the Lower North Shore and the Inner West.

Mr Patterson said he had decided to cap investments at 5 per cent to encourage liquidity.

'We limit the size to force people to spread their money around, which gives them protection through diversification,' he said.

'Secondly we've done it to encourage trading so no one person can control a property, sit on it and not allow it to go up or down.'

In the initial phase of the launch only wholesale investors – people who earned $250,000 in the last two years or have $2 million worth of assets outside their family home – can invest.

But Mr Patterson hopes to get registered to make BrickX available to the wider public in the next 12 months.
